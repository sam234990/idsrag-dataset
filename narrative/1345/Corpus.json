She employs two architects, one local and one, George Somerset, newly qualified from London. Somerset represents modernity in the novel.\nIn the village there is an amateur photographer, William Dare, who is the illegitimate son of Captain De Stancy, an impoverished scion of the family. Captain De Stancy represents a dream of medieval nobility to Paula.\nShe is attracted to both men for their different virtues but William Dare decides to intervene to promote his father in her affections. He fakes a telegram and photograph to make it appear that Somerset is leading a dissolute lifestyle. His subterfuge is discovered by Captain De Stancy's sister Charlotte who has befriended Paula.\nShe decides to tell Paula the truth and Paula pursues Somerset to the continent where he has gone mistakenly believing Paula and the Captain to have been married. She finds him and they are reunited and marry. The castle burns down and Somerset proposes to build a modern house in its place.\nThe last line has Paula summing up her dichotomy of mind between modernity and romantic medievalism, and thus the two men, also emphasising the title \"a Laodicean\" (someone indifferent or half-hearted) \u2014 \"I wish my castle wasn't burnt; and I wish you were a De Stancy!\" The usage of \"Laodicean\" to mean someone lacking commitment comes from a reference in the New Testament:\nTo the angel of the church in Laodicaea write: \u2014 \"These are the words of the Unchanging One, 'the witness faithful and true, the beginning of the Creation of God': \u2014I know your life; I know that you are neither cold nor hot.

T.H.\n\nJanuary 1896.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THE FIRST. GEORGE SOMERSET.\n\n\nI.\n\nThe sun blazed down and down, till it was within half-an-hour of its\nsetting; but the sketcher still lingered at his occupation of measuring\nand copying the chevroned doorway--a bold and quaint example of a\ntransitional style of architecture, which formed the tower entrance to\nan English village church. The graveyard being quite open on its western\nside, the tweed-clad figure of the young draughtsman, and the tall mass\nof antique masonry which rose above him to a battlemented parapet,\nwere fired to a great brightness by the solar rays, that crossed the\nneighbouring mead like a warp of gold threads, in whose mazes groups of\nequally lustrous gnats danced and wailed incessantly.\n\nHe was so absorbed in his pursuit that he did not mark the brilliant\nchromatic effect of which he composed the central feature, till it was\nbrought home to his intelligence by the warmth of the moulded stonework\nunder his touch when measuring; which led him at length to turn his head\nand gaze on its cause.\n\nThere are few in whom the sight of a sunset does not beget as much\nmeditative melancholy as contemplative pleasure, the human decline and\ndeath that it illustrates being too obvious to escape the notice of\nthe simplest observer. The sketcher, as if he had been brought to this\nreflection many hundreds of times before by the same spectacle, showed\nthat he did not wish to pursue it just now, by turning away his face\nafter a few moments, to resume his architectural studies.\n\nHe took his measurements carefully, and as if he reverenced the old\nworkers whose trick he was endeavouring to acquire six hundred years\nafter the original performance had ceased and the performers passed into\nthe unseen. By means of a strip of lead called a leaden tape, which\nhe pressed around and into the fillets and hollows with his finger and\nthumb, he transferred the exact contour of each moulding to his drawing,\nthat lay on a sketching-stool a few feet distant; where were also a\nsketching-block, a small T-square, a bow-pencil, and other mathematical\ninstruments. When he had marked down the line thus fixed, he returned to\nthe doorway to copy another as before.\n\nIt being the month of August, when the pale face of the townsman and the\nstranger is to be seen among the brown skins of remotest uplanders,\nnot only in England, but throughout the temperate zone, few of the\nhomeward-bound labourers paused to notice him further than by a\nmomentary turn of the head. They had beheld such gentlemen before, not\nexactly measuring the church so accurately as this one seemed to be\ndoing, but painting it from a distance, or at least walking round the\nmouldy pile. At the same time the present visitor, even exteriorly, was\nnot altogether commonplace. His features were good, his eyes of the dark\ndeep sort called eloquent by the sex that ought to know, and with that\nray of light in them which announces a heart susceptible to beauty of\nall kinds,--in woman, in art, and in inanimate nature. Though he\nwould have been broadly characterized as a young man, his face bore\ncontradictory testimonies to his precise age. This was conceivably\nowing to a too dominant speculative activity in him, which, while it\nhad preserved the emotional side of his constitution, and with it the\nsignificant flexuousness of mouth and chin, had played upon his forehead\nand temples till, at weary moments, they exhibited some traces of being\nover-exercised. A youthfulness about the mobile features, a mature\nforehead--though not exactly what the world has been familiar with\nin past ages--is now growing common; and with the advance of juvenile\nintrospection it probably must grow commoner still. Briefly, he had more\nof the beauty--if beauty it ought to be called--of the future human type\nthan of the past; but not so much as to make him other than a nice young\nman.\n\nHis build was somewhat slender and tall; his complexion, though a little\nbrowned by recent exposure, was that of a man who spent much of his time\nindoors. Of beard he had but small show, though he was as innocent as\na Nazarite of the use of the razor; but he possessed a moustache\nall-sufficient to hide the subtleties of his mouth, which could thus be\ntremulous at tender moments without provoking inconvenient criticism.\n\nOwing to his situation on high ground, open to the west, he remained\nenveloped in the lingering aureate haze till a time when the eastern\npart of the churchyard was in obscurity, and damp with rising dew.\nWhen it was too dark to sketch further he packed up his drawing, and,\nbeckoning to a lad who had been idling by the gate, directed him to\ncarry the stool and implements to a roadside inn which he named, lying a\nmile or two ahead. The draughtsman leisurely followed the lad out of the\nchurchyard, and along a lane in the direction signified.\n\n\n\nThe spectacle of a summer traveller from London sketching mediaeval\ndetails in these neo-Pagan days, when a lull has come over the study of\nEnglish Gothic architecture, through a re-awakening to the art-forms of\ntimes that more nearly neighbour our own, is accounted for by the fact\nthat George Somerset, son of the Academician of that name, was a man\nof independent tastes and excursive instincts, who unconsciously, and\nperhaps unhappily, took greater pleasure in floating in lonely currents\nof thought than with the general tide of opinion. When quite a lad, in\nthe days of the French Gothic mania which immediately succeeded to the\ngreat English-pointed revival under Britton, Pugin, Rickman, Scott, and\nother mediaevalists, he had crept away from the fashion to admire what\nwas good in Palladian and Renaissance. As soon as Jacobean, Queen\nAnne, and kindred accretions of decayed styles began to be popular, he\npurchased such old-school works as Revett and Stuart, Chambers, and the\nrest, and worked diligently at the Five Orders; till quite bewildered\non the question of style, he concluded that all styles were extinct, and\nwith them all architecture as a living art. Somerset was not old enough\nat that time to know that, in practice, art had at all times been as\nfull of shifts and compromises as every other mundane thing; that ideal\nperfection was never achieved by Greek, Goth, or Hebrew Jew, and\nnever would be; and thus he was thrown into a mood of disgust with\nhis profession, from which mood he was only delivered by recklessly\nabandoning these studies and indulging in an old enthusiasm for poetical\nliterature. For two whole years he did nothing but write verse in every\nconceivable metre, and on every conceivable subject, from Wordsworthian\nsonnets on the singing of his tea-kettle to epic fragments on the Fall\nof Empires. His discovery at the age of five-and-twenty that these\ninspired works were not jumped at by the publishers with all the\neagerness they deserved, coincided in point of time with a severe hint\nfrom his father that unless he went on with his legitimate profession he\nmight have to look elsewhere than at home for an allowance. Mr. Somerset\njunior then awoke to realities, became intently practical, rushed back\nto his dusty drawing-boards, and worked up the styles anew, with a view\nof regularly starting in practice on the first day of the following\nJanuary.\n\nIt is an old story, and perhaps only deserves the light tone in which\nthe soaring of a young man into the empyrean, and his descent again, is\nalways narrated. But as has often been said, the light and the truth may\nbe on the side of the dreamer: a far wider view than the wise ones\nhave may be his at that recalcitrant time, and his reduction to common\nmeasure be nothing less than a tragic event. The operation called\nlunging, in which a haltered colt is made to trot round and round\na horsebreaker who holds the rope, till the beholder grows dizzy in\nlooking at them, is a very unhappy one for the animal concerned. During\nits progress the colt springs upward, across the circle, stops, flies\nover the turf with the velocity of a bird, and indulges in all sorts of\ngraceful antics; but he always ends in one way--thanks to the knotted\nwhipcord--in a level trot round the lunger with the regularity of a\nhorizontal wheel, and in the loss for ever to his character of the\nbold contours which the fine hand of Nature gave it. Yet the process is\nconsidered to be the making of him.\n\nWhether Somerset became permanently made under the action of the\ninevitable lunge, or whether he lapsed into mere dabbling with the\nartistic side of his profession only, it would be premature to say; but\nat any rate it was his contrite return to architecture as a calling that\nsent him on the sketching excursion under notice. Feeling that something\nstill was wanting to round off his knowledge before he could take his\nprofessional line with confidence, he was led to remember that his own\nnative Gothic was the one form of design that he had totally neglected\nfrom the beginning, through its having greeted him with wearisome\niteration at the opening of his career. Now it had again returned to\nsilence; indeed--such is the surprising instability of art 'principles'\nas they are facetiously called--it was just as likely as not to sink\ninto the neglect and oblivion which had been its lot in Georgian times.\nThis accident of being out of vogue lent English Gothic an additional\ncharm to one of his proclivities; and away he went to make it the\nbusiness of a summer circuit in the west.\n\nThe quiet time of evening, the secluded neighbourhood, the unusually\ngorgeous liveries of the clouds packed in a pile over that quarter of\nthe heavens in which the sun had disappeared, were such as to make\na traveller loiter on his walk. Coming to a stile, Somerset mounted\nhimself on the top bar, to imbibe the spirit of the scene and hour. The\nevening was so still that every trifling sound could be heard for miles.\nThere was the rattle of a returning waggon, mixed with the smacks of the\nwaggoner's whip: the team must have been at least three miles off. From\nfar over the hill came the faint periodic yell of kennelled hounds;\nwhile from the nearest village resounded the voices of boys at play in\nthe twilight. Then a powerful clock struck the hour; it was not from\nthe direction of the church, but rather from the wood behind him; and he\nthought it must be the clock of some mansion that way.\n\nBut the mind of man cannot always be forced to take up subjects by the\npressure of their material presence, and Somerset's thoughts were often,\nto his great loss, apt to be even more than common truants from the\ntones and images that met his outer senses on walks and rides. He would\nsometimes go quietly through the queerest, gayest, most extraordinary\ntown in Europe, and let it alone, provided it did not meddle with him\nby its beggars, beauties, innkeepers, police, coachmen, mongrels, bad\nsmells, and such like obstructions. This feat of questionable utility he\nbegan performing now. Sitting on the three-inch ash rail that had been\npeeled and polished like glass by the rubbings of all the small-clothes\nin the parish, he forgot the time, the place, forgot that it was\nAugust--in short, everything of the present altogether. His mind flew\nback to his past life, and deplored the waste of time that had resulted\nfrom his not having been able to make up his mind which of the many\nfashions of art that were coming and going in kaleidoscopic change\nwas the true point of departure from himself. He had suffered from the\nmodern malady of unlimited appreciativeness as much as any living man\nof his own age. Dozens of his fellows in years and experience, who had\nnever thought specially of the matter, but had blunderingly applied\nthemselves to whatever form of art confronted them at the moment of\ntheir making a move, were by this time acquiring renown as new lights;\nwhile he was still unknown. He wished that some accident could have\nhemmed in his eyes between inexorable blinkers, and sped him on in a\nchannel ever so worn.\n\nThus balanced between believing and not believing in his own future,\nhe was recalled to the scene without by hearing the notes of a familiar\nhymn, rising in subdued harmonies from a valley below. He listened more\nheedfully. It was his old friend the 'New Sabbath,' which he had never\nonce heard since the lisping days of childhood, and whose existence,\nmuch as it had then been to him, he had till this moment quite\nforgotten. Where the 'New Sabbath' had kept itself all these years--why\nthat sound and hearty melody had disappeared from all the cathedrals,\nparish churches, minsters and chapels-of-ease that he had been\nacquainted with during his apprenticeship to life, and until his ways\nhad become irregular and uncongregational--he could not, at first,\nsay. But then he recollected that the tune appertained to the old\nwest-gallery period of church-music, anterior to the great choral\nreformation and the rule of Monk--that old time when the repetition of\na word, or half-line of a verse, was not considered a disgrace to an\necclesiastical choir.\n\nWilling to be interested in anything which would keep him out-of-doors,\nSomerset dismounted from the stile and descended the hill before him, to\nlearn whence the singing proceeded.\n\n\n\nII.\n\nHe found that it had its origin in a building standing alone in a field;\nand though the evening was not yet dark without, lights shone from the\nwindows. In a few moments Somerset stood before the edifice. Being just\nthen en rapport with ecclesiasticism by reason of his recent occupation,\nhe could not help murmuring, 'Shade of Pugin, what a monstrosity!'\n\nPerhaps this exclamation (rather out of date since the discovery that\nPugin himself often nodded amazingly) would not have been indulged in\nby Somerset but for his new architectural resolves, which caused\nprofessional opinions to advance themselves officiously to his\nlips whenever occasion offered. The building was, in short, a\nrecently-erected chapel of red brick, with pseudo-classic ornamentation,\nand the white regular joints of mortar could be seen streaking its\nsurface in geometrical oppressiveness from top to bottom. The roof was\nof blue slate, clean as a table, and unbroken from gable to gable;\nthe windows were glazed with sheets of plate glass, a temporary iron\nstovepipe passing out near one of these, and running up to the height of\nthe ridge, where it was finished by a covering like a parachute. Walking\nround to the end, he perceived an oblong white stone let into the wall\njust above the plinth, on which was inscribed in deep letters:--\n\n               Erected 187-,\n\n          AT THE SOLE EXPENSE OF\n\n          JOHN POWER, ESQ., M.P.\n\nThe 'New Sabbath' still proceeded line by line, with all the emotional\nswells and cadences that had of old characterized the tune: and the body\nof vocal harmony that it evoked implied a large congregation within, to\nwhom it was plainly as familiar as it had been to church-goers of a past\ngeneration. With a whimsical sense of regret at the secession of his\nonce favourite air Somerset moved away, and would have quite withdrawn\nfrom the field had he not at that moment observed two young men with\npitchers of water coming up from a stream hard by, and hastening with\ntheir burdens into the chapel vestry by a side door. Almost as soon as\nthey had entered they emerged again with empty pitchers, and proceeded\nto the stream to fill them as before, an operation which they repeated\nseveral times. Somerset went forward to the stream, and waited till the\nyoung men came out again.\n\n'You are carrying in a great deal of water,' he said, as each dipped his\npitcher.\n\nOne of the young men modestly replied, 'Yes: we filled the cistern this\nmorning; but it leaks, and requires a few pitcherfuls more.'\n\n'Why do you do it?'\n\n'There is to be a baptism, sir.'\n\nSomerset was not sufficiently interested to develop a further\nconversation, and observing them in silence till they had again vanished\ninto the building, he went on his way. Reaching the brow of the hill he\nstopped and looked back. The chapel was still in view, and the shades\nof night having deepened, the lights shone from the windows yet more\nbrightly than before. A few steps further would hide them and the\nedifice, and all that belonged to it from his sight, possibly for ever.\nThere was something in the thought which led him to linger. The chapel\nhad neither beauty, quaintness, nor congeniality to recommend it: the\ndissimilitude between the new utilitarianism of the place and the scenes\nof venerable Gothic art which had occupied his daylight hours could not\nwell be exceeded. But Somerset, as has been said, was an instrument\nof no narrow gamut: he had a key for other touches than the purely\naesthetic, even on such an excursion as this. His mind was arrested by\nthe intense and busy energy which must needs belong to an assembly that\nrequired such a glare of light to do its religion by; in the heaving of\nthat tune there was an earnestness which made him thoughtful, and the\nshine of those windows he had characterized as ugly reminded him of the\nshining of the good deed in a naughty world. The chapel and its shabby\nplot of ground, from which the herbage was all trodden away by busy\nfeet, had a living human interest that the numerous minsters and\nchurches knee-deep in fresh green grass, visited by him during the\nforegoing week, had often lacked. Moreover, there was going to be a\nbaptism: that meant the immersion of a grown-up person; and he had\nbeen told that Baptists were serious people and that the scene was most\nimpressive. What manner of man would it be who on an ordinary plodding\nand bustling evening of the nineteenth century could single himself out\nas one different from the rest of the inhabitants, banish all shyness,\nand come forward to undergo such a trying ceremony? Who was he that\nhad pondered, gone into solitudes, wrestled with himself, worked up his\ncourage and said, I will do this, though few else will, for I believe it\nto be my duty?\n\nWhether on account of these thoughts, or from the circumstance that\nhe had been alone amongst the tombs all day without communion with his\nkind, he could not tell in after years (when he had good reason to think\nof the subject); but so it was that Somerset went back, and again stood\nunder the chapel-wall.\n\nInstead of entering he passed round to where the stove-chimney came\nthrough the bricks, and holding on to the iron stay he put his toes on\nthe plinth and looked in at the window. The building was quite full of\npeople belonging to that vast majority of society who are denied the\nart of articulating their higher emotions, and crave dumbly for a\nfugleman--respectably dressed working people, whose faces and forms were\nworn and contorted by years of dreary toil. On a platform at the end\nof the chapel a haggard man of more than middle age, with grey whiskers\nascetically cut back from the fore part of his face so far as to be\nalmost banished from the countenance, stood reading a chapter. Between\nthe minister and the congregation was an open space, and in the floor of\nthis was sunk a tank full of water, which just made its surface visible\nabove the blackness of its depths by reflecting the lights overhead.\n\nSomerset endeavoured to discover which one among the assemblage was to\nbe the subject of the ceremony. But nobody appeared there who was at all\nout of the region of commonplace. The people were all quiet and settled;\nyet he could discern on their faces something more than attention,\nthough it was less than excitement: perhaps it was expectation. And as\nif to bear out his surmise he heard at that moment the noise of wheels\nbehind him.\n\nHis gaze into the lighted chapel made what had been an evening scene\nwhen he looked away from the landscape night itself on looking back;\nbut he could see enough to discover that a brougham had driven up to\nthe side-door used by the young water-bearers, and that a lady in\nwhite-and-black half-mourning was in the act of alighting, followed by\nwhat appeared to be a waiting-woman carrying wraps. They entered the\nvestry-room of the chapel, and the door was shut. The service went on as\nbefore till at a certain moment the door between vestry and chapel was\nopened, when a woman came out clothed in an ample robe of flowing white,\nwhich descended to her feet. Somerset was unfortunate in his position;\nhe could not see her face, but her gait suggested at once that she\nwas the lady who had arrived just before. She was rather tall than\notherwise, and the contour of her head and shoulders denoted a girl in\nthe heyday of youth and activity. His imagination, stimulated by this\nbeginning, set about filling in the meagre outline with most attractive\ndetails.\n\nShe stood upon the brink of the pool, and the minister descended the\nsteps at its edge till the soles of his shoes were moistened with the\nwater. He turned to the young candidate, but she did not follow him:\ninstead of doing so she remained rigid as a stone. He stretched out his\nhand, but she still showed reluctance, till, with some embarrassment, he\nwent back, and spoke softly in her ear.\n\nShe approached the edge, looked into the water, and turned away shaking\nher head. Somerset could for the first time see her face. Though humanly\nimperfect, as is every face we see, it was one which made him think that\nthe best in woman-kind no less than the best in psalm-tunes had gone\nover to the Dissenters. He had certainly seen nobody so interesting\nin his tour hitherto; she was about twenty or twenty-one--perhaps\ntwenty-three, for years have a way of stealing marches even upon\nbeauty's anointed. The total dissimilarity between the expression of\nher lineaments and that of the countenances around her was not a little\nsurprising, and was productive of hypotheses without measure as to\nhow she came there. She was, in fact, emphatically a modern type of\nmaidenhood, and she looked ultra-modern by reason of her environment: a\npresumably sophisticated being among the simple ones--not wickedly so,\nbut one who knew life fairly well for her age. Her hair, of good\nEnglish brown, neither light nor dark, was abundant--too abundant for\nconvenience in tying, as it seemed; and it threw off the lamp-light in\na hazy lustre. And though it could not be said of her features that this\nor that was flawless, the nameless charm of them altogether was only\nanother instance of how beautiful a woman can be as a whole without\nattaining in any one detail to the lines marked out as absolutely\ncorrect. The spirit and the life were there: and material shapes could\nbe disregarded.\n\nWhatever moral characteristics this might be the surface of, enough\nwas shown to assure Somerset that she had some experience of things far\nremoved from her present circumscribed horizon, and could live, and was\neven at that moment living, a clandestine, stealthy inner life which had\nvery little to do with her outward one. The repression of nearly every\nexternal sign of that distress under which Somerset knew, by a sudden\nintuitive sympathy, that she was labouring, added strength to these\nconvictions.\n\n'And you refuse?' said the astonished minister, as she still stood\nimmovable on the brink of the pool. He persuasively took her sleeve\nbetween his finger and thumb as if to draw her; but she resented this by\na quick movement of displeasure, and he released her, seeing that he had\ngone too far.\n\n'But, my dear lady,' he said, 'you promised! Consider your profession,\nand that you stand in the eyes of the whole church as an exemplar of\nyour faith.'\n\n'I cannot do it!'\n\n'But your father's memory, miss; his last dying request!'\n\n'I cannot help it,' she said, turning to get away.\n\n'You came here with the intention to fulfil the Word?'\n\n'But I was mistaken.'\n\n'Then why did you come?'\n\nShe tacitly implied that to be a question she did not care to answer.\n'Please say no more to me,' she murmured, and hastened to withdraw.\n\nDuring this unexpected dialogue (which had reached Somerset's ears\nthrough the open windows) that young man's feelings had flown hither and\nthither between minister and lady in a most capricious manner: it had\nseemed at one moment a rather uncivil thing of her, charming as she was,\nto give the minister and the water-bearers so much trouble for\nnothing; the next, it seemed like reviving the ancient cruelties of the\nducking-stool to try to force a girl into that dark water if she had not\na mind to it. But the minister was not without insight, and he had seen\nthat it would be useless to say more. The crestfallen old man had to\nturn round upon the congregation and declare officially that the baptism\nwas postponed.\n\nShe passed through the door into the vestry. During the exciting\nmoments of her recusancy there had been a perceptible flutter among the\nsensitive members of the congregation; nervous Dissenters seeming to be\nat one with nervous Episcopalians in this at least, that they heartily\ndisliked a scene during service. Calm was restored to their minds by the\nminister starting a rather long hymn in minims and semibreves, amid the\nsinging of which he ascended the pulpit. His face had a severe and\neven denunciatory look as he gave out his text, and Somerset began to\nunderstand that this meant mischief to the young person who had caused\nthe hitch.\n\n'In the third chapter of Revelation and the fifteenth and following\nverses, you will find these words:--\n\n'\"I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou\nwert cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold\nnor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.... Thou sayest, I am rich,\nand increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that\nthou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.\"'\n\nThe sermon straightway began, and it was soon apparent that the\ncommentary was to be no less forcible than the text. It was also\napparent that the words were, virtually, not directed forward in\nthe line in which they were uttered, but through the chink of the\nvestry-door, that had stood slightly ajar since the exit of the young\nlady. The listeners appeared to feel this no less than Somerset did, for\ntheir eyes, one and all, became fixed upon that vestry door as if they\nwould almost push it open by the force of their gazing. The preacher's\nheart was full and bitter; no book or note was wanted by him; never\nwas spontaneity more absolute than here. It was no timid reproof of\nthe ornamental kind, but a direct denunciation, all the more vigorous\nperhaps from the limitation of mind and language under which the speaker\nlaboured. Yet, fool that he had been made by the candidate, there was\nnothing acrid in his attack. Genuine flashes of rhetorical fire\nwere occasionally struck by that plain and simple man, who knew what\nstraightforward conduct was, and who did not know the illimitable\ncaprice of a woman's mind.\n\nAt this moment there was not in the whole chapel a person whose\nimagination was not centred on what was invisibly taking place within\nthe vestry. The thunder of the minister's eloquence echoed, of course,\nthrough the weak sister's cavern of retreat no less than round the\npublic assembly. What she was doing inside there--whether listening\ncontritely, or haughtily hastening to put on her things and get away\nfrom the chapel and all it contained--was obviously the thought of each\nmember. What changes were tracing themselves upon that lovely face: did\nit rise to phases of Raffaelesque resignation or sink so low as to flush\nand frown? was Somerset's inquiry; and a half-explanation occurred when,\nduring the discourse, the door which had been ajar was gently pushed to.\n\nLooking on as a stranger it seemed to him more than probable that this\nyoung woman's power of persistence in her unexpected repugnance to the\nrite was strengthened by wealth and position of some sort, and was\nnot the unassisted gift of nature. The manner of her arrival, and her\ndignified bearing before the assembly, strengthened the belief. A woman\nwho did not feel something extraneous to her mental self to fall back\nupon would be so far overawed by the people and the crisis as not to\nretain sufficient resolution for a change of mind.\n\nThe sermon ended, the minister wiped his steaming face and turned down\nhis cuffs, and nods and sagacious glances went round. Yet many, even of\nthose who had presumably passed the same ordeal with credit, exhibited\ngentler judgment than the preacher's on a tergiversation of which they\nhad probably recognized some germ in their own bosoms when in the lady's\nsituation.\n\nFor Somerset there was but one scene: the imagined scene of the girl\nherself as she sat alone in the vestry. The fervent congregation rose\nto sing again, and then Somerset heard a slight noise on his left hand\nwhich caused him to turn his head. The brougham, which had retired\ninto the field to wait, was back again at the door: the subject of his\nrumination came out from the chapel--not in her mystic robe of white,\nbut dressed in ordinary fashionable costume--followed as before by the\nattendant with other articles of clothing on her arm, including the\nwhite gown. Somerset fancied that the younger woman was drying her eyes\nwith her handkerchief, but there was not much time to see: they quickly\nentered the carriage, and it moved on. Then a cat suddenly mewed, and\nhe saw a white Persian standing forlorn where the carriage had been. The\ndoor was opened, the cat taken in, and the carriage drove away.\n\nThe stranger's girlish form stamped itself deeply on Somerset's soul. He\nstrolled on his way quite oblivious to the fact that the moon had just\nrisen, and that the landscape was one for him to linger over, especially\nif there were any Gothic architecture in the line of the lunar rays. The\ninference was that though this girl must be of a serious turn of mind,\nwilfulness was not foreign to her composition: and it was probable that\nher daily doings evinced without much abatement by religion the unbroken\nspirit and pride of life natural to her age.\n\nThe little village inn at which Somerset intended to pass the night\nlay a mile further on, and retracing his way up to the stile he rambled\nalong the lane, now beginning to be streaked like a zebra with the\nshadows of some young trees that edged the road. But his attention was\nattracted to the other side of the way by a hum as of a night-bee,\nwhich arose from the play of the breezes over a single wire of telegraph\nrunning parallel with his track on tall poles that had appeared by the\nroad, he hardly knew when, from a branch route, probably leading from\nsome town in the neighbourhood to the village he was approaching. He did\nnot know the population of Sleeping-Green, as the village of his search\nwas called, but the presence of this mark of civilization seemed to\nsignify that its inhabitants were not quite so far in the rear of their\nage as might be imagined; a glance at the still ungrassed heap of earth\nround the foot of each post was, however, sufficient to show that it was\nat no very remote period that they had made their advance.\n\nAided by this friendly wire Somerset had no difficulty in keeping his\ncourse, till he reached a point in the ascent of a hill at which the\ntelegraph branched off from the road, passing through an opening in the\nhedge, to strike across an undulating down, while the road wound round\nto the left. For a few moments Somerset doubted and stood still. The\nwire sang on overhead with dying falls and melodious rises that invited\nhim to follow; while above the wire rode the stars in their courses, the\nlow nocturn of the former seeming to be the voices of those stars,\n\n     'Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubim.'\n\nRecalling himself from these reflections Somerset decided to follow the\nlead of the wire. It was not the first time during his present tour that\nhe had found his way at night by the help of these musical threads which\nthe post-office authorities had erected all over the country for quite\nanother purpose than to guide belated travellers. Plunging with it\nacross the down he came to a hedgeless road that entered a park or\nchase, which flourished in all its original wildness. Tufts of rushes\nand brakes of fern rose from the hollows, and the road was in places\nhalf overgrown with green, as if it had not been tended for many years;\nso much so that, where shaded by trees, he found some difficulty in\nkeeping it. Though he had noticed the remains of a deer-fence further\nback no deer were visible, and it was scarcely possible that there\nshould be any in the existing state of things: but rabbits were\nmultitudinous, every hillock being dotted with their seated figures till\nSomerset approached and sent them limping into their burrows. The road\nnext wound round a clump of underwood beside which lay heaps of faggots\nfor burning, and then there appeared against the sky the walls and\ntowers of a castle, half ruin, half residence, standing on an eminence\nhard by.\n\nSomerset stopped to examine it. The castle was not exceptionally large,\nbut it had all the characteristics of its most important fellows.\nIrregular, dilapidated, and muffled in creepers as a great portion of it\nwas, some part--a comparatively modern wing--was inhabited, for a light\nor two steadily gleamed from some upper windows; in others a reflection\nof the moon denoted that unbroken glass yet filled their casements. Over\nall rose the keep, a square solid tower apparently not much injured by\nwars or weather, and darkened with ivy on one side, wherein wings could\nbe heard flapping uncertainly, as if they belonged to a bird unable\nto find a proper perch. Hissing noises supervened, and then a hoot,\nproclaiming that a brood of young owls were residing there in the\ncompany of older ones. In spite of the habitable and more modern wing,\nneglect and decay had set their mark upon the outworks of the pile,\nunfitting them for a more positive light than that of the present hour.\n\nHe walked up to a modern arch spanning the ditch--now dry and\ngreen--over which the drawbridge once had swung. The large door under\nthe porter's archway was closed and locked. While standing here the\nsinging of the wire, which for the last few minutes he had quite\nforgotten, again struck upon his ear, and retreating to a convenient\nplace he observed its final course: from the poles amid the trees\nit leaped across the moat, over the girdling wall, and thence by\na tremendous stretch towards the keep where, to judge by sound, it\nvanished through an arrow-slit into the interior. This fossil of\nfeudalism, then, was the journey's-end of the wire, and not the village\nof Sleeping-Green.\n\nThere was a certain unexpectedness in the fact that the hoary memorial\nof a stolid antagonism to the interchange of ideas, the monument of hard\ndistinctions in blood and race, of deadly mistrust of one's neighbour in\nspite of the Church's teaching, and of a sublime unconsciousness of\nany other force than a brute one, should be the goal of a machine which\nbeyond everything may be said to symbolize cosmopolitan views and the\nintellectual and moral kinship of all mankind. In that light the little\nbuzzing wire had a far finer significance to the student Somerset than\nthe vast walls which neighboured it. But the modern fever and fret which\nconsumes people before they can grow old was also signified by the wire;\nand this aspect of to-day did not contrast well with the fairer side\nof feudalism--leisure, light-hearted generosity, intense friendships,\nhawks, hounds, revels, healthy complexions, freedom from care, and such\na living power in architectural art as the world may never again see.\n\nSomerset withdrew till neither the singing of the wire nor the hisses of\nthe irritable owls could be heard any more. A clock in the castle struck\nten, and he recognized the strokes as those he had heard when sitting\non the stile. It was indispensable that he should retrace his steps and\npush on to Sleeping-Green if he wished that night to reach his lodgings,\nwhich had been secured by letter at a little inn in the straggling line\nof roadside houses called by the above name, where his luggage had by\nthis time probably arrived. In a quarter of an hour he was again at the\npoint where the wire left the road, and following the highway over a\nhill he saw the hamlet at his feet.\n\n\n\nIII.\n\nBy half-past ten the next morning Somerset was once more approaching\nthe precincts of the building which had interested him the night before.\nReferring to his map he had learnt that it bore the name of Stancy\nCastle or Castle de Stancy; and he had been at once struck with its\nfamiliarity, though he had never understood its position in the county,\nbelieving it further to the west. If report spoke truly there was\nsome excellent vaulting in the interior, and a change of study from\necclesiastical to secular Gothic was not unwelcome for a while.\n\nThe entrance-gate was open now, and under the archway the outer ward was\nvisible, a great part of it being laid out as a flower-garden. This was\nin process of clearing from weeds and rubbish by a set of gardeners, and\nthe soil was so encumbered that in rooting out the weeds such few hardy\nflowers as still remained in the beds were mostly brought up with them.\nThe groove wherein the portcullis had run was as fresh as if only cut\nyesterday, the very tooling of the stone being visible. Close to this\nhung a bell-pull formed of a large wooden acorn attached to a vertical\nrod. Somerset's application brought a woman from the porter's door, who\ninformed him that the day before having been the weekly show-day for\nvisitors, it was doubtful if he could be admitted now.\n\n'Who is at home?' said Somerset.\n\n'Only Miss de Stancy,' the porteress replied.\n\nHis dread of being considered an intruder was such that he thought at\nfirst there was no help for it but to wait till the next week. But\nhe had already through his want of effrontery lost a sight of many\ninteriors, whose exhibition would have been rather a satisfaction to the\ninmates than a trouble. It was inconvenient to wait; he knew nobody\nin the neighbourhood from whom he could get an introductory letter: he\nturned and passed the woman, crossed the ward where the gardeners were\nat work, over a second and smaller bridge, and up a flight of stone\nstairs, open to the sky, along whose steps sunburnt Tudor soldiers and\nother renowned dead men had doubtless many times walked. It led to the\nprincipal door on this side. Thence he could observe the walls of\nthe lower court in detail, and the old mosses with which they were\npadded--mosses that from time immemorial had been burnt brown every\nsummer, and every winter had grown green again. The arrow-slit and the\nelectric wire that entered it, like a worm uneasy at being unearthed,\nwere distinctly visible now. So also was the clock, not, as he had\nsupposed, a chronometer coeval with the fortress itself, but new and\nshining, and bearing the name of a recent maker.\n\nThe door was opened by a bland, intensely shaven man out of livery,\nwho took Somerset's name and politely worded request to be allowed to\ninspect the architecture of the more public portions of the castle. He\npronounced the word 'architecture' in the tone of a man who knew and\npractised that art; 'for,' he said to himself, 'if she thinks I am a\nmere idle tourist, it will not be so well.'\n\nNo such uncomfortable consequences ensued. Miss De Stancy had great\npleasure in giving Mr. Somerset full permission to walk through whatever\nparts of the building he chose.\n\nHe followed the butler into the inner buildings of the fortress, the\nponderous thickness of whose walls made itself felt like a physical\npressure. An internal stone staircase, ranged round four sides of a\nsquare, was next revealed, leading at the top of one flight into a\nspacious hall, which seemed to occupy the whole area of the keep. From\nthis apartment a corridor floored with black oak led to the more modern\nwing, where light and air were treated in a less gingerly fashion.\n\nHere passages were broader than in the oldest portion, and upholstery\nenlisted in the service of the fine arts hid to a great extent the\ncoldness of the walls.\n\nSomerset was now left to himself, and roving freely from room to room\nhe found time to inspect the different objects of interest that abounded\nthere. Not all the chambers, even of the habitable division, were in use\nas dwelling-rooms, though these were still numerous enough for the wants\nof an ordinary country family. In a long gallery with a coved ceiling\nof arabesques which had once been gilded, hung a series of paintings\nrepresenting the past personages of the De Stancy line. It was a\nremarkable array--even more so on account of the incredibly neglected\ncondition of the canvases than for the artistic peculiarities they\nexhibited. Many of the frames were dropping apart at their angles, and\nsome of the canvas was so dingy that the face of the person depicted was\nonly distinguishable as the moon through mist. For the colour they had\nnow they might have been painted during an eclipse; while, to judge by\nthe webs tying them to the wall, the spiders that ran up and down their\nbacks were such as to make the fair originals shudder in their graves.\n\nHe wondered how many of the lofty foreheads and smiling lips of this\npictorial pedigree could be credited as true reflections of their\nprototypes. Some were wilfully false, no doubt; many more so by\nunavoidable accident and want of skill. Somerset felt that it required a\nprofounder mind than his to disinter from the lumber of conventionality\nthe lineaments that really sat in the painter's presence, and to\ndiscover their history behind the curtain of mere tradition.\n\nThe painters of this long collection were those who usually appear in\nsuch places; Holbein, Jansen, and Vandyck; Sir Peter, Sir Geoffrey, Sir\nJoshua, and Sir Thomas. Their sitters, too, had mostly been sirs; Sir\nWilliam, Sir John, or Sir George De Stancy--some undoubtedly having\na nobility stamped upon them beyond that conferred by their robes and\norders; and others not so fortunate. Their respective ladies hung by\ntheir sides--feeble and watery, or fat and comfortable, as the case\nmight be; also their fathers and mothers-in-law, their brothers and\nremoter relatives; their contemporary reigning princes, and their\nintimate friends. Of the De Stancys pure there ran through the\ncollection a mark by which they might surely have been recognized as\nmembers of one family; this feature being the upper part of the nose.\nEvery one, even if lacking other points in common, had the special\nindent at this point in the face--sometimes moderate in degree,\nsometimes excessive.\n\nWhile looking at the pictures--which, though not in his regular line of\nstudy, interested Somerset more than the architecture, because of their\nsingular dilapidation, it occurred to his mind that he had in his youth\nbeen schoolfellow for a very short time with a pleasant boy bearing a\nsurname attached to one of the paintings--the name of Ravensbury. The\nboy had vanished he knew not how--he thought he had been removed from\nschool suddenly on account of ill health. But the recollection was\nvague, and Somerset moved on to the rooms above and below. In addition\nto the architectural details of which he had as yet obtained but\nglimpses, there was a great collection of old movables and other\ndomestic art-work--all more than a century old, and mostly lying as\nlumber. There were suites of tapestry hangings, common and fine; green\nand scarlet leather-work, on which the gilding was still but little\ninjured; venerable damask curtains; quilted silk table-covers,\nebony cabinets, worked satin window-cushions, carved bedsteads, and\nembroidered bed-furniture which had apparently screened no sleeper for\nthese many years. Downstairs there was also an interesting collection of\narmour, together with several huge trunks and coffers. A great many\nof them had been recently taken out and cleaned, as if a long dormant\ninterest in them were suddenly revived. Doubtless they were those which\nhad been used by the living originals of the phantoms that looked down\nfrom the frames.\n\nThis excellent hoard of suggestive designs for wood-work, metal-work,\nand work of other sorts, induced Somerset to divert his studies from\nthe ecclesiastical direction, to acquire some new ideas from the objects\nhere for domestic application. Yet for the present he was inclined\nto keep his sketch-book closed and his ivory rule folded, and devote\nhimself to a general survey. Emerging from the ground-floor by a small\ndoorway, he found himself on a terrace to the north-east, and on the\nother side than that by which he had entered. It was bounded by a\nparapet breast high, over which a view of the distant country met the\neye, stretching from the foot of the slope to a distance of many miles.\nSomerset went and leaned over, and looked down upon the tops of the\nbushes beneath. The prospect included the village he had passed through\non the previous day: and amidst the green lights and shades of the\nmeadows he could discern the red brick chapel whose recalcitrant inmate\nhad so engrossed him.\n\nBefore his attention had long strayed over the incident which\nromanticized that utilitarian structure, he became aware that he was not\nthe only person who was looking from the terrace towards that point of\nthe compass. At the right-hand corner, in a niche of the curtain-wall,\nreclined a girlish shape; and asleep on the bench over which she leaned\nwas a white cat--the identical Persian as it seemed--that had been taken\ninto the carriage at the chapel-door.\n\nSomerset began to muse on the probability or otherwise of the\nbacksliding Baptist and this young lady resulting in one and the same\nperson; and almost without knowing it he found himself deeply hoping for\nsuch a unity. The object of his inspection was idly leaning, and\nthis somewhat disguised her figure. It might have been tall or short,\ncurvilinear or angular. She carried a light sunshade which she fitfully\ntwirled until, thrusting it back over her shoulder, her head was\nrevealed sufficiently to show that she wore no hat or bonnet. This token\nof her being an inmate of the castle, and not a visitor, rather damped\nhis expectations: but he persisted in believing her look towards the\nchapel must have a meaning in it, till she suddenly stood erect, and\nrevealed herself as short in stature--almost dumpy--at the same time\ngiving him a distinct view of her profile. She was not at all like the\nheroine of the chapel. He saw the dinted nose of the De Stancys outlined\nwith Holbein shadowlessness against the blue-green of the distant wood.\nIt was not the De Stancy face with all its original specialities: it\nwas, so to speak, a defective reprint of that face: for the nose tried\nhard to turn up and deal utter confusion to the family shape.\n\nAs for the rest of the countenance, Somerset was obliged to own that it\nwas not beautiful: Nature had done there many things that she ought not\nto have done, and left undone much that she should have executed. It\nwould have been decidedly plain but for a precious quality which no\nperfection of chiselling can give when the temperament denies it, and\nwhich no facial irregularity can take away--a tender affectionateness\nwhich might almost be called yearning; such as is often seen in the\nwomen of Correggio when they are painted in profile. But the plain\nfeatures of Miss De Stancy--who she undoubtedly was--were rather\nseverely handled by Somerset's judgment owing to his impression of the\nprevious night. A beauty of a sort would have been lent by the flexuous\ncontours of the mobile parts but for that unfortunate condition the poor\ngirl was burdened with, of having to hand on a traditional feature with\nwhich she did not find herself otherwise in harmony.\n\nShe glanced at him for a moment, and showed by an imperceptible movement\nthat he had made his presence felt. Not to embarrass her Somerset\nhastened to withdraw, at the same time that she passed round to the\nother part of the terrace, followed by the cat, in whom Somerset could\nimagine a certain denominational cast of countenance, notwithstanding\nher company. But as white cats are much alike each other at a distance,\nit was reasonable to suppose this creature was not the same one as that\npossessed by the beauty.\n\n\n\nIV.\n\nHe descended the stone stairs to a lower story of the castle, in which\nwas a crypt-like hall covered by vaulting of exceptional and massive\ningenuity:\n\n          'Built ere the art was known,\n     By pointed aisle and shafted stalk\n     The arcades of an alleyed walk\n           To emulate in stone.'\n\nIt happened that the central pillar whereon the vaults rested, reputed\nto exhibit some of the most hideous grotesques in England upon its\ncapital, was within a locked door. Somerset was tempted to ask a\nservant for permission to open it, till he heard that the inner room\nwas temporarily used for plate, the key being kept by Miss De Stancy, at\nwhich he said no more. But afterwards the active housemaid redescended\nthe stone steps; she entered the crypt with a bunch of keys in one hand,\nand in the other a candle, followed by the young lady whom Somerset had\nseen on the terrace.\n\n'I shall be very glad to unlock anything you may want to see. So few\npeople take any real interest in what is here that we do not leave it\nopen.'\n\nSomerset expressed his thanks.\n\nMiss De Stancy, a little to his surprise, had a touch of rusticity in\nher manner, and that forced absence of reserve which seclusion from\nsociety lends to young women more frequently than not. She seemed glad\nto have something to do; the arrival of Somerset was plainly an event\nsufficient to set some little mark upon her day. Deception had been\nwritten on the faces of those frowning walls in their implying the\ninsignificance of Somerset, when he found them tenanted only by this\nlittle woman whose life was narrower than his own.\n\n'We have not been here long,' continued Miss De Stancy, 'and that's why\neverything is in such a dilapidated and confused condition.'\n\nSomerset entered the dark store-closet, thinking less of the ancient\npillar revealed by the light of the candle than what a singular remark\nthe latter was to come from a member of the family which appeared to\nhave been there five centuries. He held the candle above his head, and\nwalked round, and presently Miss De Stancy came back.\n\n'There is another vault below,' she said, with the severe face of a\nyoung woman who speaks only because it is absolutely necessary. 'Perhaps\nyou are not aware of it? It was the dungeon: if you wish to go\ndown there too, the servant will show you the way. It is not at all\nornamental: rough, unhewn arches and clumsy piers.'\n\nSomerset thanked her, and would perhaps take advantage of her kind\noffer when he had examined the spot where he was, if it were not causing\ninconvenience.\n\n'No; I am sure Paula will be glad to know that anybody thinks it\ninteresting to go down there--which is more than she does herself.'\n\nSome obvious inquiries were suggested by this, but Somerset said, 'I\nhave seen the pictures, and have been much struck by them; partly,' he\nadded, with some hesitation, 'because one or two of them reminded me of\na schoolfellow--I think his name was John Ravensbury?'\n\n'Yes,' she said, almost eagerly. 'He was my cousin!'\n\n'So that we are not quite strangers?'\n\n'But he is dead now.... He was unfortunate: he was mostly spoken of\nas \"that unlucky boy.\"... You know, I suppose, Mr. Somerset, why the\npaintings are in such a decaying state!--it is owing to the peculiar\ntreatment of the castle during Mr. Wilkins's time. He was blind; so one\ncan imagine he did not appreciate such things as there are here.'\n\n'The castle has been shut up, you mean?'\n\n'O yes, for many years. But it will not be so again. We are going to\nhave the pictures cleaned, and the frames mended, and the old pieces of\nfurniture put in their proper places. It will be very nice then. Did you\nsee those in the east closet?'\n\n'I have only seen those in the gallery.'\n\n'I will just show you the way to the others, if you would like to see\nthem?'\n\nThey ascended to the room designated the east closet. The paintings\nhere, mostly of smaller size, were in a better condition, owing to the\nfact that they were hung on an inner wall, and had hence been kept free\nfrom damp. Somerset inquired the names and histories of one or two.\n\n'I really don't quite know,' Miss De Stancy replied after some thought.\n'But Paula knows, I am sure. I don't study them much--I don't see the\nuse of it.' She swung her sunshade, so that it fell open, and turned it\nup till it fell shut. 'I have never been able to give much attention to\nancestors,' she added, with her eyes on the parasol.\n\n'These ARE your ancestors?' he asked, for her position and tone were\nmatters which perplexed him. In spite of the family likeness and other\ndetails he could scarcely believe this frank and communicative country\nmaiden to be the modern representative of the De Stancys.\n\n'O yes, they certainly are,' she said, laughing. 'People say I am like\nthem: I don't know if I am--well, yes, I know I am: I can see that, of\ncourse, any day. But they have gone from my family, and perhaps it\nis just as well that they should have gone.... They are useless,' she\nadded, with serene conclusiveness.\n\n'Ah! they have gone, have they?'\n\n'Yes, castle and furniture went together: it was long ago--long before\nI was born. It doesn't seem to me as if the place ever belonged to a\nrelative of mine.'\n\nSomerset corrected his smiling manner to one of solicitude.\n\n'But you live here, Miss De Stancy?'\n\n'Yes--a great deal now; though sometimes I go home to sleep.'\n\n'This is home to you, and not home?'\n\n'I live here with Paula--my friend: I have not been here long, neither\nhas she. For the first six months after her father's death she did not\ncome here at all.'\n\nThey walked on, gazing at the walls, till the young man said: 'I fear\nI may be making some mistake: but I am sure you will pardon my\ninquisitiveness this once. WHO is Paula?'\n\n'Ah, you don't know! Of course you don't--local changes don't get talked\nof far away. She is the owner of this castle and estate. My father sold\nit when he was quite a young man, years before I was born, and not long\nafter his father's death. It was purchased by a man named Wilkins, a\nrich man who became blind soon after he had bought it, and never lived\nhere; so it was left uncared for.'\n\nShe went out upon the terrace; and without exactly knowing why, Somerset\nfollowed.\n\n'Your friend--'\n\n'Has only come here quite recently. She is away from home to-day.... It\nwas very sad,' murmured the young girl thoughtfully. 'No sooner had\nMr. Power bought it of the representatives of Mr. Wilkins--almost\nimmediately indeed--than he died from a chill caught after a warm bath.\nOn account of that she did not take possession for several months; and\neven now she has only had a few rooms prepared as a temporary residence\ntill she can think what to do. Poor thing, it is sad to be left alone!'\n\nSomerset heedfully remarked that he thought he recognized that name\nPower, as one he had seen lately, somewhere or other.\n\n'Perhaps you have been hearing of her father. Do you know what he was?'\n\nSomerset did not.\n\nShe looked across the distant country, where undulations of dark-green\nfoliage formed a prospect extending for miles. And as she watched, and\nSomerset's eyes, led by hers, watched also, a white streak of steam,\nthin as a cotton thread, could be discerned ploughing that green\nexpanse. 'Her father made THAT,' Miss De Stancy said, directing her\nfinger towards the object.\n\n'That what?'\n\n'That railway. He was Mr. John Power, the great railway contractor. And\nit was through making the railway that he discovered this castle--the\nrailway was diverted a little on its account.'\n\n'A clash between ancient and modern.'\n\n'Yes, but he took an interest in the locality long before he purchased\nthe estate. And he built the people a chapel on a bit of freehold he\nbought for them. He was a great Nonconformist, a staunch Baptist up to\nthe day of his death--a much stauncher one,' she said significantly,\n'than his daughter is.'\n\n'Ah, I begin to spot her!'\n\n'You have heard about the baptism?'\n\n'I know something of it.'\n\n'Her conduct has given mortal offence to the scattered people of the\ndenomination that her father was at such pains to unite into a body.'\n\nSomerset could guess the remainder, and in thinking over the\ncircumstances did not state what he had seen. She added, as if\ndisappointed at his want of curiosity--\n\n'She would not submit to the rite when it came to the point. The water\nlooked so cold and dark and fearful, she said, that she could not do it\nto save her life.'\n\n'Surely she should have known her mind before she had gone so far?'\nSomerset's words had a condemnatory form, but perhaps his actual feeling\nwas that if Miss Power had known her own mind, she would have not\ninterested him half so much.\n\n'Paula's own mind had nothing to do with it!' said Miss De Stancy,\nwarming up to staunch partizanship in a moment. 'It was all undertaken\nby her from a mistaken sense of duty. It was her father's dying wish\nthat she should make public profession of her--what do you call it--of\nthe denomination she belonged to, as soon as she felt herself fit to\ndo it: so when he was dead she tried and tried, and didn't get any more\nfit; and at last she screwed herself up to the pitch, and thought she\nmust undergo the ceremony out of pure reverence for his memory. It was\nvery short-sighted of her father to put her in such a position: because\nshe is now very sad, as she feels she can never try again after such a\nsermon as was delivered against her.'\n\nSomerset presumed that Miss Power need not have heard this Knox or\nBossuet of hers if she had chosen to go away?\n\n'She did not hear it in the face of the congregation; but from the\nvestry. She told me some of it when she reached home. Would you believe\nit, the man who preached so bitterly is a tenant of hers? I said,\n\"Surely you will turn him out of his house?\"--But she answered, in her\ncalm, deep, nice way, that she supposed he had a perfect right to preach\nagainst her, that she could not in justice molest him at all. I wouldn't\nlet him stay if the house were mine. But she has often before allowed\nhim to scold her from the pulpit in a smaller way--once it was about an\nexpensive dress she had worn--not mentioning her by name, you know; but\nall the people are quite aware that it is meant for her, because only\none person of her wealth or position belongs to the Baptist body in this\ncounty.'\n\nSomerset was looking at the homely affectionate face of the little\nspeaker. 'You are her good friend, I am sure,' he remarked.\n\nShe looked into the distant air with tacit admission of the impeachment.\n'So would you be if you knew her,' she said; and a blush slowly rose\nto her cheek, as if the person spoken of had been a lover rather than a\nfriend.\n\n'But you are not a Baptist any more than I?' continued Somerset.\n\n'O no. And I never knew one till I knew Paula. I think they are very\nnice; though I sometimes wish Paula was not one, but the religion of\nreasonable persons.'\n\nThey walked on, and came opposite to where the telegraph emerged from\nthe trees, leapt over the parapet, and up through the loophole into the\ninterior.\n\n'That looks strange in such a building,' said her companion.\n\n'Miss Power had it put up to know the latest news from town. It costs\nsix pounds a mile. She can work it herself, beautifully: and so can\nI, but not so well. It was a great delight to learn. Miss Power was\nso interested at first that she was sending messages from morning till\nnight. And did you hear the new clock?'\n\n'Is it a new one?--Yes, I heard it.'\n\n'The old one was quite worn out; so Paula has put it in the cellar, and\nhad this new one made, though it still strikes on the old bell. It tells\nthe seconds, but the old one, which my very great grandfather erected in\nthe eighteenth century, only told the hours. Paula says that time,\nbeing so much more valuable now, must of course be cut up into smaller\npieces.'\n\n'She does not appear to be much impressed by the spirit of this ancient\npile.'\n\nMiss De Stancy shook her head too slightly to express absolute negation.\n\n'Do you wish to come through this door?' she asked. 'There is a singular\nchimney-piece in the kitchen, which is considered a unique example of\nits kind, though I myself don't know enough about it to have an opinion\non the subject.'\n\nWhen they had looked at the corbelled chimney-piece they returned to the\nhall, where his eye was caught anew by a large map that he had conned\nfor some time when alone, without being able to divine the locality\nrepresented. It was called 'General Plan of the Town,' and showed\nstreets and open spaces corresponding with nothing he had seen in the\ncounty.\n\n'Is that town here?' he asked.\n\n'It is not anywhere but in Paula's brain; she has laid it out from her\nown design. The site is supposed to be near our railway station, just\nacross there, where the land belongs to her. She is going to grant cheap\nbuilding leases, and develop the manufacture of pottery.'\n\n'Pottery--how very practical she must be!'\n\n'O no! no!' replied Miss De Stancy, in tones showing how supremely\nignorant he must be of Miss Power's nature if he characterized her in\nthose terms. 'It is GREEK pottery she means--Hellenic pottery she tells\nme to call it, only I forget. There is beautiful clay at the place,\nher father told her: he found it in making the railway tunnel. She has\nvisited the British Museum, continental museums, and Greece, and Spain:\nand hopes to imitate the old fictile work in time, especially the Greek\nof the best period, four hundred years after Christ, or before Christ--I\nforget which it was Paula said.... O no, she is not practical in the\nsense you mean, at all.'\n\n'A mixed young lady, rather.'\n\nMiss De Stancy appeared unable to settle whether this new definition of\nher dear friend should be accepted as kindly, or disallowed as decidedly\nsarcastic. 'You would like her if you knew her,' she insisted, in half\ntones of pique; after which she walked on a few steps.\n\n'I think very highly of her,' said Somerset.\n\n'And I! And yet at one time I could never have believed that I should\nhave been her friend. One is prejudiced at first against people who are\nreported to have such differences in feeling, associations, and habit,\nas she seemed to have from mine. But it has not stood in the least in\nthe way of our liking each other. I believe the difference makes us the\nmore united.'\n\n'It says a great deal for the liberality of both,' answered Somerset\nwarmly. 'Heaven send us more of the same sort of people! They are not\ntoo numerous at present.'\n\nAs this remark called for no reply from Miss De Stancy, she took\nadvantage of an opportunity to leave him alone, first repeating her\npermission to him to wander where he would. He walked about for some\ntime, sketch-book in hand, but was conscious that his interest did not\nlie much in the architecture. In passing along the corridor of an\nupper floor he observed an open door, through which was visible a room\ncontaining one of the finest Renaissance cabinets he had ever seen. It\nwas impossible, on close examination, to do justice to it in a hasty\nsketch; it would be necessary to measure every line if he would bring\naway anything of utility to him as a designer. Deciding to reserve this\ngem for another opportunity he cast his eyes round the room and blushed\na little. Without knowing it he had intruded into the absent Miss\nPaula's own particular set of chambers, including a boudoir and sleeping\napartment. On the tables of the sitting-room were most of the popular\npapers and periodicals that he knew, not only English, but from Paris,\nItaly, and America. Satirical prints, though they did not unduly\npreponderate, were not wanting. Besides these there were books from a\nLondon circulating library, paper-covered light literature in French and\nchoice Italian, and the latest monthly reviews; while between the two\nwindows stood the telegraph apparatus whose wire had been the means of\nbringing him hither.\n\nThese things, ensconced amid so much of the old and hoary, were as if\na stray hour from the nineteenth century had wandered like a butterfly\ninto the thirteenth, and lost itself there.\n\nThe door between this ante-chamber and the sleeping-room stood open.\nWithout venturing to cross the threshold, for he felt that he would be\nabusing hospitality to go so far, Somerset looked in for a moment. It\nwas a pretty place, and seemed to have been hastily fitted up. In a\ncorner, overhung by a blue and white canopy of silk, was a little cot,\nhardly large enough to impress the character of bedroom upon the old\nplace. Upon a counterpane lay a parasol and a silk neckerchief. On the\nother side of the room was a tall mirror of startling newness, draped\nlike the bedstead, in blue and white. Thrown at random upon the floor\nwas a pair of satin slippers that would have fitted Cinderella. A\ndressing-gown lay across a settee; and opposite, upon a small easy-chair\nin the same blue and white livery, were a Bible, the Baptist Magazine,\nWardlaw on Infant Baptism, Walford's County Families, and the Court\nJournal. On and over the mantelpiece were nicknacks of various\ndescriptions, and photographic portraits of the artistic, scientific,\nand literary celebrities of the day.\n\nA dressing-room lay beyond; but, becoming conscious that his study\nof ancient architecture would hardly bear stretching further in that\ndirection, Mr. Somerset retreated to the outside, obliviously passing by\nthe gem of Renaissance that had led him in.\n\n'She affects blue,' he was thinking. 'Then she is fair.'\n\nOn looking up, some time later, at the new clock that told the seconds,\nhe found that the hours at his disposal for work had flown without his\nhaving transferred a single feature of the building or furniture to his\nsketch-book. Before leaving he sent in for permission to come again, and\nthen walked across the fields to the inn at Sleeping-Green, reflecting\nless upon Miss De Stancy (so little force of presence had she possessed)\nthan upon the modern flower in a mediaeval flower-pot whom Miss De\nStancy's information had brought before him, and upon the incongruities\nthat were daily shaping themselves in the world under the great modern\nfluctuations of classes and creeds.\n\nSomerset was still full of the subject when he arrived at the end of\nhis walk, and he fancied that some loungers at the bar of the inn were\ndiscussing the heroine of the chapel-scene just at the moment of his\nentry. On this account, when the landlord came to clear away the dinner,\nSomerset was led to inquire of him, by way of opening a conversation, if\nthere were many Baptists in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe landlord (who was a serious man on the surface, though he\noccasionally smiled beneath) replied that there were a great many--far\nmore than the average in country parishes. 'Even here, in my house,\nnow,' he added, 'when volks get a drop of drink into 'em, and their\nfeelings rise to a zong, some man will strike up a hymn by preference.\nBut I find no fault with that; for though 'tis hardly human nature to be\nso calculating in yer cups, a feller may as well sing to gain something\nas sing to waste.'\n\n'How do you account for there being so many?'\n\n'Well, you zee, sir, some says one thing, and some another; I think they\ndoes it to save the expense of a Christian burial for ther children. Now\nthere's a poor family out in Long Lane--the husband used to smite for\nJimmy More the blacksmith till 'a hurt his arm--they'd have no less than\neleven children if they'd not been lucky t'other way, and buried five\nwhen they were three or four months old. Now every one of them children\nwas given to the sexton in a little box that any journeyman could nail\ntogether in a quarter of an hour, and he buried 'em at night for a\nshilling a head; whereas 'twould have cost a couple of pounds each if\nthey'd been christened at church.... Of course there's the new lady\nat the castle, she's a chapel member, and that may make a little\ndifference; but she's not been here long enough to show whether 'twill\nbe worth while to join 'em for the profit o't or whether 'twill not. No\ndoubt if it turns out that she's of a sort to relieve volks in trouble,\nmore will join her set than belongs to it already. \"Any port in a\nstorm,\" of course, as the saying is.'\n\n'As for yourself, you are a Churchman at present, I presume?'\n\n'Yes; not but I was a Methodist once--ay, for a length of time. 'Twas\nowing to my taking a house next door to a chapel; so that what with\nhearing the organ bizz like a bee through the wall, and what with\nfinding it saved umbrellas on wet Zundays, I went over to that faith for\ntwo years--though I believe I dropped money by it--I wouldn't be the man\nto say so if I hadn't. Howsomever, when I moved into this house I turned\nback again to my old religion. Faith, I don't zee much difference: be\nyou one, or be you t'other, you've got to get your living.'\n\n'The De Stancys, of course, have not much influence here now, for that,\nor any other thing?'\n\n'O no, no; not any at all. They be very low upon ground, and always\nwill be now, I suppose. It was thoughted worthy of being recorded in\nhistory--you've read it, sir, no doubt?'\n\n'Not a word.'\n\n'O, then, you shall. I've got the history zomewhere. 'Twas gay manners\nthat did it. The only bit of luck they have had of late years is\nMiss Power's taking to little Miss De Stancy, and making her her\ncompany-keeper. I hope 'twill continue.'\n\nThat the two daughters of these antipodean families should be such\nintimate friends was a situation which pleased Somerset as much as it\ndid the landlord. It was an engaging instance of that human progress\non which he had expended many charming dreams in the years when poetry,\ntheology, and the reorganization of society had seemed matters of more\nimportance to him than a profession which should help him to a big house\nand income, a fair Deiopeia, and a lovely progeny. When he was alone he\npoured out a glass of wine, and silently drank the healths of the two\ngenerous-minded young women who, in this lonely district, had found\nsweet communion a necessity of life, and by pure and instinctive good\nsense had broken down a barrier which men thrice their age and repute\nwould probably have felt it imperative to maintain. But perhaps this was\npremature: the omnipotent Miss Power's character--practical or ideal,\npolitic or impulsive--he as yet knew nothing of; and giving over\nreasoning from insufficient data he lapsed into mere conjecture.\n\n\n\nV.\n\nThe next morning Somerset was again at the castle. He passed some\ninterval on the walls before encountering Miss De Stancy, whom at last\nhe observed going towards a pony-carriage that waited near the door.\n\nA smile gained strength upon her face at his approach, and she was the\nfirst to speak. 'I am sorry Miss Power has not returned,' she said, and\naccounted for that lady's absence by her distress at the event of two\nevenings earlier.\n\n'But I have driven over to my father's--Sir William De Stancy's--house\nthis morning,' she went on. 'And on mentioning your name to him, I found\nhe knew it quite well. You will, will you not, forgive my ignorance in\nhaving no better knowledge of the elder Mr. Somerset's works than a dim\nsense of his fame as a painter? But I was going to say that my father\nwould much like to include you in his personal acquaintance, and wishes\nme to ask if you will give him the pleasure of lunching with him to-day.\nMy cousin John, whom you once knew, was a great favourite of his, and\nused to speak of you sometimes. It will be so kind if you can come. My\nfather is an old man, out of society, and he would be glad to hear the\nnews of town.'\n\nSomerset said he was glad to find himself among friends where he had\nonly expected strangers; and promised to come that day, if she would\ntell him the way.\n\nThat she could easily do. The short way was across that glade he saw\nthere--then over the stile into the wood, following the path till it\ncame out upon the turnpike-road. He would then be almost close to the\nhouse. The distance was about two miles and a half. But if he thought it\ntoo far for a walk, she would drive on to the town, where she had been\ngoing when he came, and instead of returning straight to her father's\nwould come back and pick him up.\n\nIt was not at all necessary, he thought. He was a walker, and could find\nthe path.\n\nAt this moment a servant came to tell Miss De Stancy that the telegraph\nwas calling her.\n\n'Ah--it is lucky that I was not gone again!' she exclaimed. 'John seldom\nreads it right if I am away.'\n\nIt now seemed quite in the ordinary course that, as a friend of her\nfather's, he should accompany her to the instrument. So up they went\ntogether, and immediately on reaching it she applied her ear to the\ninstrument, and began to gather the message. Somerset fancied himself\nlike a person overlooking another's letter, and moved aside.\n\n'It is no secret,' she said, smiling. '\"Paula to Charlotte,\" it begins.'\n\n'That's very pretty.'\n\n'O--and it is about--you,' murmured Miss De Stancy.\n\n'Me?' The architect blushed a little.\n\nShe made no answer, and the machine went on with its story. There was\nsomething curious in watching this utterance about himself, under his\nvery nose, in language unintelligible to him. He conjectured whether it\nwere inquiry, praise, or blame, with a sense that it might reasonably\nbe the latter, as the result of his surreptitious look into that blue\nbedroom, possibly observed and reported by some servant of the house.\n\n'\"Direct that every facility be given to Mr. Somerset to visit any\npart of the castle he may wish to see. On my return I shall be glad to\nwelcome him as the acquaintance of your relatives. I have two of his\nfather's pictures.\"'\n\n'Dear me, the plot thickens,' he said, as Miss De Stancy announced the\nwords. 'How could she know about me?'\n\n'I sent a message to her this morning when I saw you crossing the park\non your way here--telling her that Mr. Somerset, son of the Academician,\nwas making sketches of the castle, and that my father knew something of\nyou. That's her answer.'\n\n'Where are the pictures by my father that she has purchased?'\n\n'O, not here--at least, not unpacked.'\n\nMiss de Stancy then left him to proceed on her journey to Markton (so\nthe nearest little town was called), informing him that she would be\nat her father's house to receive him at two o'clock. Just about one he\nclosed his sketch-book, and set out in the direction she had indicated.\nAt the entrance to the wood a man was at work pulling down a rotten gate\nthat bore on its battered lock the initials 'W. De S.' and erecting a\nnew one whose ironmongery exhibited the letters 'P. P.'\n\nThe warmth of the summer noon did not inconveniently penetrate the dense\nmasses of foliage which now began to overhang the path, except in spots\nwhere a ruthless timber-felling had taken place in previous years for\nthe purpose of sale. It was that particular half-hour of the day in\nwhich the birds of the forest prefer walking to flying; and there being\nno wind, the hopping of the smallest songster over the dead leaves\nreached his ear from behind the undergrowth. The track had originally\nbeen a well-kept winding drive, but a deep carpet of moss and leaves\noverlaid it now, though the general outline still remained to show that\nits curves had been set out with as much care as those of a lawn walk,\nand the gradient made easy for carriages where the natural slopes were\ngreat. Felled trunks occasionally lay across it, and alongside were the\nhollow and fungous boles of trees sawn down in long past years.\n\nAfter a walk of three-quarters of an hour he came to another gate, where\nthe letters 'P. P.' again supplanted the historical 'W. De S.' Climbing\nover this, he found himself on a highway which presently dipped down\ntowards the town of Markton, a place he had never yet seen. It appeared\nin the distance as a quiet little borough of a few thousand inhabitants;\nand, without the town boundary on the side he was approaching, stood\nhalf-a-dozen genteel and modern houses, of the detached kind usually\nfound in such suburbs. On inquiry, Sir William De Stancy's residence was\nindicated as one of these.\n\nIt was almost new, of streaked brick, having a central door, and a small\nbay window on each side to light the two front parlours. A little\nlawn spread its green surface in front, divided from the road by iron\nrailings, the low line of shrubs immediately within them being coated\nwith pallid dust from the highway. On the neat piers of the neat\nentrance gate were chiselled the words 'Myrtle Villa.' Genuine roadside\nrespectability sat smiling on every brick of the eligible dwelling.\n\nPerhaps that which impressed Somerset more than the mushroom modernism\nof Sir William De Stancy's house was the air of healthful cheerfulness\nwhich pervaded it. He was shown in by a neat maidservant in black gown\nand white apron, a canary singing a welcome from a cage in the shadow\nof the window, the voices of crowing cocks coming over the chimneys from\nsomewhere behind, and the sun and air riddling the house everywhere.\n\nA dwelling of those well-known and popular dimensions which allow the\nproceedings in the kitchen to be distinctly heard in the parlours, it\nwas so planned that a raking view might be obtained through it from the\nfront door to the end of the back garden. The drawing-room furniture\nwas comfortable, in the walnut-and-green-rep style of some years ago.\nSomerset had expected to find his friends living in an old house with\nremnants of their own antique furniture, and he hardly knew whether he\nought to meet them with a smile or a gaze of condolence. His doubt\nwas terminated, however, by the cheerful and tripping entry of Miss De\nStancy, who had returned from her drive to Markton; and in a few more\nmoments Sir William came in from the garden.\n\nHe was an old man of tall and spare build, with a considerable stoop,\nhis glasses dangling against his waistcoat-buttons, and the front\ncorners of his coat-tails hanging lower than the hinderparts, so that\nthey swayed right and left as he walked. He nervously apologized to his\nvisitor for having kept him waiting.\n\n'I am so glad to see you,' he said, with a mild benevolence of tone,\nas he retained Somerset's hand for a moment or two; 'partly for your\nfather's sake, whom I met more than once in my younger days, before he\nbecame so well-known; and also because I learn that you were a friend of\nmy poor nephew John Ravensbury.' He looked over his shoulder to see if\nhis daughter were within hearing, and, with the impulse of the solitary\nto make a confidence, continued in a low tone: 'She, poor girl, was\nto have married John: his death was a sad blow to her and to all of\nus.--Pray take a seat, Mr. Somerset.'\n\nThe reverses of fortune which had brought Sir William De Stancy to\nthis comfortable cottage awakened in Somerset a warmer emotion than\ncuriosity, and he sat down with a heart as responsive to each speech\nuttered as if it had seriously concerned himself, while his host gave\nsome words of information to his daughter on the trifling events that\nhad marked the morning just passed; such as that the cow had got out of\nthe paddock into Miss Power's field, that the smith who had promised\nto come and look at the kitchen range had not arrived, that two wasps'\nnests had been discovered in the garden bank, and that Nick Jones's baby\nhad fallen downstairs. Sir William had large cavernous arches to his\neye-sockets, reminding the beholder of the vaults in the castle he\nonce had owned. His hands were long and almost fleshless, each knuckle\nshowing like a bamboo-joint from beneath his coat-sleeves, which were\nsmall at the elbow and large at the wrist. All the colour had gone from\nhis beard and locks, except in the case of a few isolated hairs of the\nformer, which retained dashes of their original shade at sudden points\nin their length, revealing that all had once been raven black.\n\nBut to study a man to his face for long is a species of ill-nature which\nrequires a colder temperament, or at least an older heart, than the\narchitect's was at that time. Incurious unobservance is the true\nattitude of cordiality, and Somerset blamed himself for having fallen\ninto an act of inspection even briefly. He would wait for his host's\nconversation, which would doubtless be of the essence of historical\nromance.\n\n'The favourable Bank-returns have made the money-market much easier\nto-day, as I learn?' said Sir William.\n\n'O, have they?' said Somerset. 'Yes, I suppose they have.'\n\n'And something is meant by this unusual quietness in Foreign stocks\nsince the late remarkable fluctuations,' insisted the old man. 'Is the\ncurrent of speculation quite arrested, or is it but a temporary lull?'\n\nSomerset said he was afraid he could not give an opinion, and entered\nvery lamely into the subject; but Sir William seemed to find sufficient\ninterest in his own thoughts to do away with the necessity of acquiring\nfresh impressions from other people's replies; for often after putting a\nquestion he looked on the floor, as if the subject were at an end. Lunch\nwas now ready, and when they were in the dining-room Miss De Stancy,\nto introduce a topic of more general interest, asked Somerset if he had\nnoticed the myrtle on the lawn?\n\nSomerset had noticed it, and thought he had never seen such a full-blown\none in the open air before. His eyes were, however, resting at the\nmoment on the only objects at all out of the common that the dining-room\ncontained. One was a singular glass case over the fireplace, within\nwhich were some large mediaeval door-keys, black with rust and age; and\nthe others were two full-length oil portraits in the costume of the end\nof the last century--so out of all proportion to the size of the room\nthey occupied that they almost reached to the floor.\n\n'Those originally belonged to the castle yonder,' said Miss De Stancy,\nor Charlotte, as her father called her, noticing Somerset's glance at\nthe keys. 'They used to unlock the principal entrance-doors, which were\nknocked to pieces in the civil wars. New doors were placed afterwards,\nbut the old keys were never given up, and have been preserved by us ever\nsince.'\n\n'They are quite useless--mere lumber--particularly to me,' said Sir\nWilliam.\n\n'And those huge paintings were a present from Paula,' she continued.\n'They are portraits of my great-grandfather and mother. Paula would give\nall the old family pictures back to me if we had room for them; but they\nwould fill the house to the ceilings.'\n\nSir William was impatient of the subject. 'What is the utility of\nsuch accumulations?' he asked. 'Their originals are but clay now--mere\nforgotten dust, not worthy a moment's inquiry or reflection at this\ndistance of time. Nothing can retain the spirit, and why should we\npreserve the shadow of the form?--London has been very full this year,\nsir, I have been told?'\n\n'It has,' said Somerset, and he asked if they had been up that season.\nIt was plain that the matter with which Sir William De Stancy least\ncared to occupy himself before visitors was the history of his own\nfamily, in which he was followed with more simplicity by his daughter\nCharlotte.\n\n'No,' said the baronet. 'One might be led to think there is a fatality\nwhich prevents it. We make arrangements to go to town almost every year,\nto meet some old friend who combines the rare conditions of being\nin London with being mindful of me; but he has always died or gone\nelsewhere before the event has taken place.... But with a disposition to\nbe happy, it is neither this place nor the other that can render us the\nreverse. In short each man's happiness depends upon himself, and his\nability for doing with little.' He turned more particularly to Somerset,\nand added with an impressive smile: 'I hope you cultivate the art of\ndoing with little?'\n\nSomerset said that he certainly did cultivate that art, partly because\nhe was obliged to.\n\n'Ah--you don't mean to the extent that I mean. The world has not yet\nlearned the riches of frugality, says, I think, Cicero, somewhere; and\nnobody can testify to the truth of that remark better than I. If a man\nknows how to spend less than his income, however small that may\nbe, why--he has the philosopher's stone.' And Sir William looked in\nSomerset's face with frugality written in every pore of his own, as much\nas to say, 'And here you see one who has been a living instance of those\nprinciples from his youth up.'\n\nSomerset soon found that whatever turn the conversation took, Sir\nWilliam invariably reverted to this topic of frugality. When luncheon\nwas over he asked his visitor to walk with him into the garden, and no\nsooner were they alone than he continued: 'Well, Mr. Somerset, you are\ndown here sketching architecture for professional purposes. Nothing can\nbe better: you are a young man, and your art is one in which there are\ninnumerable chances.'\n\n'I had begun to think they were rather few,' said Somerset.\n\n'No, they are numerous enough: the difficulty is to find out where they\nlie. It is better to know where your luck lies than where your talent\nlies: that's an old man's opinion.'\n\n'I'll remember it,' said Somerset.\n\n'And now give me some account of your new clubs, new hotels, and new\nmen.... What I was going to add, on the subject of finding out where\nyour luck lies, is that nobody is so unfortunate as not to have a lucky\nstar in some direction or other. Perhaps yours is at the antipodes; if\nso, go there. All I say is, discover your lucky star.'\n\n'I am looking for it.'\n\n'You may be able to do two things; one well, the other but\nindifferently, and yet you may have more luck in the latter. Then stick\nto that one, and never mind what you can do best. Your star lies there.'\n\n'There I am not quite at one with you, Sir William.'\n\n'You should be. Not that I mean to say that luck lies in any one place\nlong, or at any one person's door. Fortune likes new faces, and your\nwisdom lies in bringing your acquisitions into safety while her favour\nlasts. To do that you must make friends in her time of smiles--make\nfriends with people, wherever you find them. My daughter has\nunconsciously followed that maxim. She has struck up a warm friendship\nwith our neighbour, Miss Power, at the castle. We are diametrically\ndifferent from her in associations, traditions, ideas, religion--she\ncomes of a violent dissenting family among other things--but I say to\nCharlotte what I say to you: win affection and regard wherever you can,\nand accommodate yourself to the times. I put nothing in the way of their\nintimacy, and wisely so, for by this so many pleasant hours are added to\nthe sum total vouchsafed to humanity.'\n\nIt was quite late in the afternoon when Somerset took his leave. Miss\nDe Stancy did not return to the castle that night, and he walked through\nthe wood as he had come, feeling that he had been talking with a man\nof simple nature, who flattered his own understanding by devising\nMachiavellian theories after the event, to account for any spontaneous\naction of himself or his daughter, which might otherwise seem eccentric\nor irregular.\n\nBefore Somerset reached the inn he was overtaken by a slight shower, and\non entering the house he walked into the general room, where there was a\nfire, and stood with one foot on the fender. The landlord was talking to\nsome guest who sat behind a screen; and, probably because Somerset\nhad been seen passing the window, and was known to be sketching at the\ncastle, the conversation turned on Sir William De Stancy.\n\n'I have often noticed,' observed the landlord, 'that volks who have come\nto grief, and quite failed, have the rules how to succeed in life more\nat their vingers' ends than volks who have succeeded. I assure you that\nSir William, so full as he is of wise maxims, never acted upon a wise\nmaxim in his life, until he had lost everything, and it didn't matter\nwhether he was wise or no. You know what he was in his young days, of\ncourse?'\n\n'No, I don't,' said the invisible stranger.\n\n'O, I thought everybody knew poor Sir William's history. He was the\nstar, as I may zay, of good company forty years ago. I remember him in\nthe height of his jinks, as I used to zee him when I was a very little\nboy, and think how great and wonderful he was. I can seem to zee now\nthe exact style of his clothes; white hat, white trousers, white silk\nhandkerchief; and his jonnick face, as white as his clothes with keeping\nlate hours. There was nothing black about him but his hair and his\neyes--he wore no beard at that time--and they were black as slooes. The\nlike of his coming on the race-course was never seen there afore nor\nsince. He drove his ikkipage hisself; and it was always hauled by four\nbeautiful white horses, and two outriders rode in harness bridles. There\nwas a groom behind him, and another at the rubbing-post, all in livery\nas glorious as New Jerusalem. What a 'stablishment he kept up at that\ntime! I can mind him, sir, with thirty race-horses in training at\nonce, seventeen coach-horses, twelve hunters at his box t'other side of\nLondon, four chargers at Budmouth, and ever so many hacks.'\n\n'And he lost all by his racing speculations?' the stranger observed;\nand Somerset fancied that the voice had in it something more than the\nlanguid carelessness of a casual sojourner.\n\n'Partly by that, partly in other ways. He spent a mint o' money in\na wild project of founding a watering-place; and sunk thousands in a\nuseless silver mine; so 'twas no wonder that the castle named after him\nvell into other hands.... The way it was done was curious. Mr. Wilkins,\nwho was the first owner after it went from Sir William, actually sat\ndown as a guest at his table, and got up as the owner. He took off, at\na round sum, everything saleable, furniture, plate, pictures, even the\nmilk and butter in the dairy. That's how the pictures and furniture\ncome to be in the castle still; wormeaten rubbish zome o' it, and hardly\nworth moving.'\n\n'And off went the baronet to Myrtle Villa?'\n\n'O no! he went away for many years. 'Tis quite lately, since his\nillness, that he came to that little place, in zight of the stone walls\nthat were the pride of his forefathers.'\n\n'From what I hear, he has not the manner of a broken-hearted man?'\n\n'Not at all. Since that illness he has been happy, as you see him: no\npride, quite calm and mild; at new moon quite childish. 'Tis that makes\nhim able to live there; before he was so ill he couldn't bear a zight of\nthe place, but since then he is happy nowhere else, and never leaves\nthe parish further than to drive once a week to Markton. His head won't\nstand society nowadays, and he lives quite lonely as you zee, only\nzeeing his daughter, or his son whenever he comes home, which is not\noften. They say that if his brain hadn't softened a little he would ha'\ndied--'twas that saved his life.'\n\n'What's this I hear about his daughter? Is she really hired companion to\nthe new owner?'\n\n'Now that's a curious thing again, these two girls being so fond of one\nanother; one of 'em a dissenter, and all that, and t'other a De Stancy.\nO no, not hired exactly, but she mostly lives with Miss Power, and goes\nabout with her, and I dare say Miss Power makes it wo'th her while.\nOne can't move a step without the other following; though judging by\nordinary volks you'd think 'twould be a cat-and-dog friendship rather.'\n\n'But 'tis not?'\n\n''Tis not; they be more like lovers than maid and maid. Miss Power is\nlooked up to by little De Stancy as if she were a god-a'mighty, and Miss\nPower lets her love her to her heart's content. But whether Miss Power\nloves back again I can't zay, for she's as deep as the North Star.'\n\nThe landlord here left the stranger to go to some other part of the\nhouse, and Somerset drew near to the glass partition to gain a glimpse\nof a man whose interest in the neighbourhood seemed to have arisen so\nsimultaneously with his own. But the inner room was empty: the man had\napparently departed by another door.\n\n\n\nVI.\n\nThe telegraph had almost the attributes of a human being at Stancy\nCastle. When its bell rang people rushed to the old tapestried chamber\nallotted to it, and waited its pleasure with all the deference due to\nsuch a novel inhabitant of that ancestral pile. This happened on the\nfollowing afternoon about four o'clock, while Somerset was sketching in\nthe room adjoining that occupied by the instrument. Hearing its call, he\nlooked in to learn if anybody were attending, and found Miss De Stancy\nbending over it.\n\nShe welcomed him without the least embarrassment. 'Another message,' she\nsaid.--'\"Paula to Charlotte.--Have returned to Markton. Am starting for\nhome. Will be at the gate between four and five if possible.\"'\n\nMiss De Stancy blushed with pleasure when she raised her eyes from the\nmachine. 'Is she not thoughtful to let me know beforehand?'\n\nSomerset said she certainly appeared to be, feeling at the same time\nthat he was not in possession of sufficient data to make the opinion of\ngreat value.\n\n'Now I must get everything ready, and order what she will want, as Mrs.\nGoodman is away. What will she want? Dinner would be best--she has had\nno lunch, I know; or tea perhaps, and dinner at the usual time. Still,\nif she has had no lunch--Hark, what do I hear?'\n\nShe ran to an arrow-slit, and Somerset, who had also heard something,\nlooked out of an adjoining one. They could see from their elevated\nposition a great way along the white road, stretching like a tape amid\nthe green expanses on each side. There had arisen a cloud of dust,\naccompanied by a noise of wheels.\n\n'It is she,' said Charlotte. 'O yes--it is past four--the telegram has\nbeen delayed.'\n\n'How would she be likely to come?'\n\n'She has doubtless hired a carriage at the inn: she said it would be\nuseless to send to meet her, as she couldn't name a time.... Where is\nshe now?'\n\n'Just where the boughs of those beeches overhang the road--there she is\nagain!'\n\nMiss De Stancy went away to give directions, and Somerset continued to\nwatch. The vehicle, which was of no great pretension, soon crossed the\nbridge and stopped: there was a ring at the bell; and Miss De Stancy\nreappeared.\n\n'Did you see her as she drove up--is she not interesting?'\n\n'I could not see her.'\n\n'Ah, no--of course you could not from this window because of the trees.\nMr. Somerset, will you come downstairs? You will have to meet her, you\nknow.'\n\nSomerset felt an indescribable backwardness. 'I will go on with my\nsketching,' he said. 'Perhaps she will not be--'\n\n'O, but it would be quite natural, would it not? Our manners are easier\nhere, you know, than they are in town, and Miss Power has adapted\nherself to them.'\n\nA compromise was effected by Somerset declaring that he would hold\nhimself in readiness to be discovered on the landing at any convenient\ntime.\n\nA servant entered. 'Miss Power?' said Miss De Stancy, before he could\nspeak.\n\nThe man advanced with a card: Miss De Stancy took it up, and read\nthereon: 'Mr. William Dare.'\n\n'It is not Miss Power who has come, then?' she asked, with a\ndisappointed face.\n\n'No, ma'am.'\n\nShe looked again at the card. 'This is some man of business, I\nsuppose--does he want to see me?'\n\n'Yes, miss. Leastwise, he would be glad to see you if Miss Power is not\nat home.'\n\nMiss De Stancy left the room, and soon returned, saying, 'Mr. Somerset,\ncan you give me your counsel in this matter? This Mr. Dare says he is a\nphotographic amateur, and it seems that he wrote some time ago to Miss\nPower, who gave him permission to take views of the castle, and promised\nto show him the best points. But I have heard nothing of it, and\nscarcely know whether I ought to take his word in her absence. Mrs.\nGoodman, Miss Power's relative, who usually attends to these things, is\naway.'\n\n'I dare say it is all right,' said Somerset.\n\n'Would you mind seeing him? If you think it quite in order, perhaps you\nwill instruct him where the best views are to be obtained?'\n\nThereupon Somerset at once went down to Mr. Dare. His coming as a sort\nof counterfeit of Miss Power disposed Somerset to judge him with as much\nseverity as justice would allow, and his manner for the moment was not\nof a kind calculated to dissipate antagonistic instincts. Mr. Dare was\nstanding before the fireplace with his feet wide apart, and his hands\nin the pockets of his coat-tails, looking at a carving over the\nmantelpiece. He turned quickly at the sound of Somerset's footsteps, and\nrevealed himself as a person quite out of the common.\n\nHis age it was impossible to say. There was not a hair on his face which\ncould serve to hang a guess upon. In repose he appeared a boy; but his\nactions were so completely those of a man that the beholder's first\nestimate of sixteen as his age was hastily corrected to six-and-twenty,\nand afterwards shifted hither and thither along intervening years as\nthe tenor of his sentences sent him up or down. He had a broad forehead,\nvertical as the face of a bastion, and his hair, which was parted in\nthe middle, hung as a fringe or valance above, in the fashion sometimes\naffected by the other sex. He wore a heavy ring, of which the gold\nseemed fair, the diamond questionable, and the taste indifferent. There\nwere the remains of a swagger in his body and limbs as he came forward,\nregarding Somerset with a confident smile, as if the wonder were, not\nwhy Mr. Dare should be present, but why Somerset should be present\nlikewise; and the first tone that came from Dare's lips wound up his\nlistener's opinion that he did not like him.\n\nA latent power in the man, or boy, was revealed by the circumstance that\nSomerset did not feel, as he would ordinarily have done, that\nit was a matter of profound indifference to him whether this\ngentleman-photographer were a likeable person or no.\n\n'I have called by appointment; or rather, I left a card stating that\nto-day would suit me, and no objection was made.' Somerset recognized\nthe voice; it was that of the invisible stranger who had talked with the\nlandlord about the De Stancys. Mr. Dare then proceeded to explain his\nbusiness.\n\nSomerset found from his inquiries that the man had unquestionably been\ninstructed by somebody to take the views he spoke of; and concluded that\nDare's curiosity at the inn was, after all, naturally explained by his\nerrand to this place. Blaming himself for a too hasty condemnation of\nthe stranger, who though visually a little too assured was civil enough\nverbally, Somerset proceeded with the young photographer to sundry\ncorners of the outer ward, and thence across the moat to the field,\nsuggesting advantageous points of view. The office, being a shadow of\nhis own pursuits, was not uncongenial to Somerset, and he forgot other\nthings in attending to it.\n\n'Now in our country we should stand further back than this, and so get a\nmore comprehensive coup d'oeil,' said Dare, as Somerset selected a good\nsituation.\n\n'You are not an Englishman, then,' said Somerset.\n\n'I have lived mostly in India, Malta, Gibraltar, the Ionian Islands,\nand Canada. I there invented a new photographic process, which I am bent\nupon making famous. Yet I am but a dilettante, and do not follow this\nart at the base dictation of what men call necessity.'\n\n'O indeed,' Somerset replied.\n\nAs soon as this business was disposed of, and Mr. Dare had brought up\nhis van and assistant to begin operations, Somerset returned to the\ncastle entrance. While under the archway a man with a professional look\ndrove up in a dog-cart and inquired if Miss Power were at home to-day.\n\n'She has not yet returned, Mr. Havill,' was the reply.\n\nSomerset, who had hoped to hear an affirmative by this time,\nthought that Miss Power was bent on disappointing him in the flesh,\nnotwithstanding the interest she expressed in him by telegraph; and as\nit was now drawing towards the end of the afternoon, he walked off in\nthe direction of his inn.\n\nThere were two or three ways to that spot, but the pleasantest was by\npassing through a rambling shrubbery, between whose bushes trickled\na broad shallow brook, occasionally intercepted in its course by a\ntransverse chain of old stones, evidently from the castle walls, which\nformed a miniature waterfall. The walk lay along the river-brink. Soon\nSomerset saw before him a circular summer-house formed of short sticks\nnailed to ornamental patterns. Outside the structure, and immediately\nin the path, stood a man with a book in his hand; and it was presently\napparent that this gentleman was holding a conversation with some\nperson inside the pavilion, but the back of the building being towards\nSomerset, the second individual could not be seen.\n\nThe speaker at one moment glanced into the interior, and at another\nat the advancing form of the architect, whom, though distinctly enough\nbeheld, the other scarcely appeared to heed in the absorbing interest\nof his own discourse. Somerset became aware that it was the Baptist\nminister, whose rhetoric he had heard in the chapel yonder.\n\n'Now,' continued the Baptist minister, 'will you express to me any\nreason or objection whatever which induces you to withdraw from our\ncommunion? It was that of your father, and of his father before him. Any\ndifficulty you may have met with I will honestly try to remove; for\nI need hardly say that in losing you we lose one of the most valued\nmembers of the Baptist church in this district. I speak with all the\nrespect due to your position, when I ask you to realize how irreparable\nis the injury you inflict upon the cause here by this lukewarm\nbackwardness.'\n\n'I don't withdraw,' said a woman's low voice within.\n\n'What do you do?'\n\n'I decline to attend for the present.'\n\n'And you can give no reason for this?'\n\nThere was no reply.\n\n'Or for your refusal to proceed with the baptism?'\n\n'I have been christened.'\n\n'My dear young lady, it is well known that your christening was the work\nof your aunt, who did it unknown to your parents when she had you in\nher power, out of pure obstinacy to a church with which she was not in\nsympathy, taking you surreptitiously, and indefensibly, to the font\nof the Establishment; so that the rite meant and could mean nothing at\nall.... But I fear that your new position has brought you into contact\nwith the Paedobaptists, that they have disturbed your old principles,\nand so induced you to believe in the validity of that trumpery\nceremony!'\n\n'It seems sufficient.'\n\n'I will demolish the basis of that seeming in three minutes, give me but\nthat time as a listener.'\n\n'I have no objection.'\n\n'Very well.... First, then, I will assume that those who have influenced\nyou in the matter have not been able to make any impression upon one so\nwell grounded as yourself in our distinctive doctrine, by the stale old\nargument drawn from circumcision?'\n\n'You may assume it.'\n\n'Good--that clears the ground. And we now come to the New Testament.'\n\nThe minister began to turn over the leaves of his little Bible, which it\nimpressed Somerset to observe was bound with a flap, like a pocket book,\nthe black surface of the leather being worn brown at the corners by long\nusage. He turned on till he came to the beginning of the New Testament,\nand then commenced his discourse. After explaining his position, the old\nman ran very ably through the arguments, citing well-known writers on\nthe point in dispute when he required more finished sentences than his\nown.\n\nThe minister's earnestness and interest in his own case led him\nunconsciously to include Somerset in his audience as the young man\ndrew nearer; till, instead of fixing his eyes exclusively on the person\nwithin the summer-house, the preacher began to direct a good proportion\nof his discourse upon his new auditor, turning from one listener to\nthe other attentively, without seeming to feel Somerset's presence as\nsuperfluous.\n\n'And now,' he said in conclusion, 'I put it to you, sir, as to her: do\nyou find any flaw in my argument? Is there, madam, a single text which,\nhonestly interpreted, affords the least foothold for the Paedobaptists;\nin other words, for your opinion on the efficacy of the rite\nadministered to you in your unconscious infancy? I put it to you both as\nhonest and responsible beings.' He turned again to the young man.\n\nIt happened that Somerset had been over this ground long ago. Born, so\nto speak, a High-Church infant, in his youth he had been of a thoughtful\nturn, till at one time an idea of his entering the Church had been\nentertained by his parents. He had formed acquaintance with men of\nalmost every variety of doctrinal practice in this country; and, as\nthe pleadings of each assailed him before he had arrived at an age of\nsufficient mental stability to resist new impressions, however badly\nsubstantiated, he inclined to each denomination as it presented itself,\nwas\n\n     'Everything by starts, and nothing long,'\n\ntill he had travelled through a great many beliefs and doctrines without\nfeeling himself much better than when he set out.\n\nA study of fonts and their origin had qualified him in this particular\nsubject. Fully conscious of the inexpediency of contests on minor ritual\ndifferences, he yet felt a sudden impulse towards a mild intellectual\ntournament with the eager old man--purely as an exercise of his wits in\nthe defence of a fair girl.\n\n'Sir, I accept your challenge to us,' said Somerset, advancing to the\nminister's side.\n\n\n\nVII.\n\nAt the sound of a new voice the lady in the bower started, as he could\nsee by her outline through the crevices of the wood-work and creepers.\nThe minister looked surprised.\n\n'You will lend me your Bible, sir, to assist my memory?' he continued.\n\nThe minister held out the Bible with some reluctance, but he allowed\nSomerset to take it from his hand. The latter, stepping upon a large\nmoss-covered stone which stood near, and laying his hat on a flat beech\nbough that rose and fell behind him, pointed to the minister to seat\nhimself on the grass. The minister looked at the grass, and looked up\nagain at Somerset, but did not move.\n\nSomerset for the moment was not observing him. His new position had\nturned out to be exactly opposite the open side of the bower, and now\nfor the first time he beheld the interior. On the seat was the woman\nwho had stood beneath his eyes in the chapel, the 'Paula' of Miss De\nStancy's enthusiastic eulogies. She wore a summer hat, beneath which\nher fair curly hair formed a thicket round her forehead. It would be\nimpossible to describe her as she then appeared. Not sensuous enough\nfor an Aphrodite, and too subdued for a Hebe, she would yet, with the\nadjunct of doves or nectar, have stood sufficiently well for either\nof those personages, if presented in a pink morning light, and with\nmythological scarcity of attire.\n\nHalf in surprise she glanced up at him; and lowering her eyes again,\nas if no surprise were ever let influence her actions for more than a\nmoment, she sat on as before, looking past Somerset's position at the\nview down the river, visible for a long distance before her till it was\nlost under the bending trees.\n\nSomerset turned over the leaves of the minister's Bible, and began:--\n\n'In the First Epistle to the Corinthians, the seventh chapter and the\nfourteenth verse--'.\n\nHere the young lady raised her eyes in spite of her reserve, but it\nbeing, apparently, too much labour to keep them raised, allowed her\nglance to subside upon her jet necklace, extending it with the thumb of\nher left hand.\n\n'Sir!' said the Baptist excitedly, 'I know that passage well--it is the\nlast refuge of the Paedobaptists--I foresee your argument. I have met\nit dozens of times, and it is not worth that snap of the fingers! It\nis worth no more than the argument from circumcision, or the\nSuffer-little-children argument.'\n\n'Then turn to the sixteenth chapter of the Acts, and the thirty-third--'\n\n'That, too,' cried the minister, 'is answered by what I said before! I\nperceive, sir, that you adopt the method of a special pleader, and not\nthat of an honest inquirer. Is it, or is it not, an answer to my proofs\nfrom the eighth chapter of the Acts, the thirty-sixth and thirty-seventh\nverses; the sixteenth of Mark, sixteenth verse; second of Acts,\nforty-first verse; the tenth and the forty-seventh verse; or the\neighteenth and eighth verse?'\n\n'Very well, then. Let me prove the point by other reasoning--by the\nargument from Apostolic tradition.' He threw the minister's book upon\nthe grass, and proceeded with his contention, which comprised a fairly\ngood exposition of the earliest practice of the Church and inferences\ntherefrom. (When he reached this point an interest in his off-hand\narguments was revealed by the mobile bosom of Miss Paula Power, though\nshe still occupied herself by drawing out the necklace.) Testimony from\nJustin Martyr followed; with inferences from Irenaeus in the expression,\n'Omnes enim venit per semetipsum salvare; omnes inquam, qui per eum\nrenascuntur in Deum, INFANTES et parvulos et pueros et juvenes.' (At the\nsound of so much seriousness Paula turned her eyes upon the speaker with\nattention.) He next adduced proof of the signification of 'renascor'\nin the writings of the Fathers, as reasoned by Wall; arguments\nfrom Tertullian's advice to defer the rite; citations from Cyprian,\nNazianzen, Chrysostom, and Jerome; and briefly summed up the whole\nmatter.\n\nSomerset looked round for the minister as he concluded. But the old man,\nafter standing face to face with the speaker, had turned his back upon\nhim, and during the latter portions of the attack had moved slowly away.\nHe now looked back; his countenance was full of commiserating reproach\nas he lifted his hand, twice shook his head, and said, 'In the Epistle\nto the Philippians, first chapter and sixteenth verse, it is written\nthat there are some who preach in contention and not sincerely. And\nin the Second Epistle to Timothy, fourth chapter and fourth verse,\nattention is drawn to those whose ears refuse the truth, and are turned\nunto fables. I wish you good afternoon, sir, and that priceless gift,\nSINCERITY.'\n\nThe minister vanished behind the trees; Somerset and Miss Power being\nleft confronting each other alone.\n\nSomerset stepped aside from the stone, hat in hand, at the same moment\nin which Miss Power rose from her seat. She hesitated for an instant,\nand said, with a pretty girlish stiffness, sweeping back the skirt of\nher dress to free her toes in turning: 'Although you are personally\nunknown to me, I cannot leave you without expressing my deep sense of\nyour profound scholarship, and my admiration for the thoroughness of\nyour studies in divinity.'\n\n'Your opinion gives me great pleasure,' said Somerset, bowing, and\nfairly blushing. 'But, believe me, I am no scholar, and no theologian.\nMy knowledge of the subject arises simply from the accident that some\nfew years ago I looked into the question for a special reason. In the\nstudy of my profession I was interested in the designing of fonts and\nbaptisteries, and by a natural process I was led to investigate the\nhistory of baptism; and some of the arguments I then learnt up still\nremain with me. That's the simple explanation of my erudition.'\n\n'If your sermons at the church only match your address to-day, I shall\nnot wonder at hearing that the parishioners are at last willing to\nattend.'\n\nIt flashed upon Somerset's mind that she supposed him to be the new\ncurate, of whose arrival he had casually heard, during his sojourn at\nthe inn. Before he could bring himself to correct an error to which,\nperhaps, more than to anything else, was owing the friendliness of her\nmanner, she went on, as if to escape the embarrassment of silence:--\n\n'I need hardly say that I at least do not doubt the sincerity of your\narguments.'\n\n'Nevertheless, I was not altogether sincere,' he answered.\n\nShe was silent.\n\n'Then why should you have delivered such a defence of me?' she asked\nwith simple curiosity.\n\nSomerset involuntarily looked in her face for his answer.\n\nPaula again teased the necklace. 'Would you have spoken so eloquently on\nthe other side if I--if occasion had served?' she inquired shyly.\n\n'Perhaps I would.'\n\nAnother pause, till she said, 'I, too, was insincere.'\n\n'You?'\n\n'I was.'\n\n'In what way?\n\n'In letting him, and you, think I had been at all influenced by\nauthority, scriptural or patristic.'\n\n'May I ask, why, then, did you decline the ceremony the other evening?'\n\n'Ah, you, too, have heard of it!' she said quickly.\n\n'No.'\n\n'What then?'\n\n'I saw it.'\n\nShe blushed and looked down the river. 'I cannot give my reasons,' she\nsaid.\n\n'Of course not,' said Somerset.\n\n'I would give a great deal to possess real logical dogmatism.'\n\n'So would I.'\n\nThere was a moment of embarrassment: she wanted to get away, but did\nnot precisely know how. He would have withdrawn had she not said, as if\nrather oppressed by her conscience, and evidently still thinking him\nthe curate: 'I cannot but feel that Mr. Woodwell's heart has been\nunnecessarily wounded.'\n\n'The minister's?'\n\n'Yes. He is single-mindedness itself. He gives away nearly all he has\nto the poor. He works among the sick, carrying them necessaries with his\nown hands. He teaches the ignorant men and lads of the village when\nhe ought to be resting at home, till he is absolutely prostrate from\nexhaustion, and then he sits up at night writing encouraging letters\nto those poor people who formerly belonged to his congregation in the\nvillage, and have now gone away. He always offends ladies, because he\ncan't help speaking the truth as he believes it; but he hasn't offended\nme!'\n\nHer feelings had risen towards the end, so that she finished quite\nwarmly, and turned aside.\n\n'I was not in the least aware that he was such a man,' murmured\nSomerset, looking wistfully after the minister.... 'Whatever you may\nhave done, I fear that I have grievously wounded a worthy man's heart\nfrom an idle wish to engage in a useless, unbecoming, dull, last-century\nargument.'\n\n'Not dull,' she murmured, 'for it interested me.'\n\nSomerset accepted her correction willingly. 'It was ill-considered of\nme, however,' he said; 'and in his distress he has forgotten his Bible.'\nHe went and picked up the worn volume from where it lay on the grass.\n\n'You can easily win him to forgive you, by just following, and returning\nthe book to him,' she observed.\n\n'I will,' said the young man impulsively. And, bowing to her, he\nhastened along the river brink after the minister. He at length saw his\nfriend before him, leaning over the gate which led from the private\npath into a lane, his cheek resting on the palm of his hand with every\noutward sign of abstraction. He was not conscious of Somerset's presence\ntill the latter touched him on the shoulder.\n\nNever was a reconciliation effected more readily. When Somerset said\nthat, fearing his motives might be misconstrued, he had followed to\nassure the minister of his goodwill and esteem, Mr. Woodwell held out\nhis hand, and proved his friendliness in return by preparing to have\nthe controversy on their religious differences over again from the\nbeginning, with exhaustive detail. Somerset evaded this with alacrity,\nand once having won his companion to other subjects he found that the\naustere man had a smile as pleasant as an infant's on the rare moments\nwhen he indulged in it; moreover, that he was warmly attached to Miss\nPower.\n\n'Though she gives me more trouble than all the rest of the Baptist\nchurch in this district,' he said, 'I love her as my own daughter. But\nI am sadly exercised to know what she is at heart. Heaven supply me with\nfortitude to contest her wild opinions, and intractability! But she has\nsweet virtues, and her conduct at times can be most endearing.'\n\n'I believe it!' said Somerset, with more fervour than mere politeness\nrequired.\n\n'Sometimes I think those Stancy towers and lands will be a curse to her.\nThe spirit of old papistical times still lingers in the nooks of those\nsilent walls, like a bad odour in a still atmosphere, dulling the\niconoclastic emotions of the true Puritan. It would be a pity indeed\nif she were to be tainted by the very situation that her father's\nindomitable energy created for her.'\n\n'Do not be concerned about her,' said Somerset gently. 'She's not a\nPaedobaptist at heart, although she seems so.'\n\nMr. Woodwell placed his finger on Somerset's arm, saying, 'If she's\nnot a Paedobaptist, or Episcopalian; if she is not vulnerable to the\nmediaeval influences of her mansion, lands, and new acquaintance, it\nis because she's been vulnerable to what is worse: to doctrines beside\nwhich the errors of Paaedobaptists, Episcopalians, Roman Catholics, are\nbut as air.'\n\n'How? You astonish me.'\n\n'Have you heard in your metropolitan experience of a curious body of New\nLights, as they think themselves?' The minister whispered a name to his\nlistener, as if he were fearful of being overheard.\n\n'O no,' said Somerset, shaking his head, and smiling at the minister's\nhorror. 'She's not that; at least, I think not.. .. She's a woman;\nnothing more. Don't fear for her; all will be well.'\n\nThe poor old man sighed. 'I love her as my own. I will say no more.'\n\nSomerset was now in haste to go back to the lady, to ease her apparent\nanxiety as to the result of his mission, and also because time seemed\nheavy in the loss of her discreet voice and soft, buoyant look. Every\nmoment of delay began to be as two. But the minister was too earnest\nin his converse to see his companion's haste, and it was not till\nperception was forced upon him by the actual retreat of Somerset that he\nremembered time to be a limited commodity. He then expressed his wish\nto see Somerset at his house to tea any afternoon he could spare, and\nreceiving the other's promise to call as soon as he could, allowed the\nyounger man to set out for the summer-house, which he did at a smart\npace. When he reached it he looked around, and found she was gone.\n\nSomerset was immediately struck by his own lack of social dexterity. Why\ndid he act so readily on the whimsical suggestion of another person, and\nfollow the minister, when he might have said that he would call on\nMr. Woodwell to-morrow, and, making himself known to Miss Power as the\nvisiting architect of whom she had heard from Miss De Stancy, have had\nthe pleasure of attending her to the castle? 'That's what any other man\nwould have had wit enough to do!' he said.\n\nThere then arose the question whether her despatching him after the\nminister was such an admirable act of good-nature to a good man as it\nhad at first seemed to be. Perhaps it was simply a manoeuvre for getting\nrid of himself; and he remembered his doubt whether a certain light\nin her eyes when she inquired concerning his sincerity were innocent\nearnestness or the reverse. As the possibility of levity crossed\nhis brain, his face warmed; it pained him to think that a woman so\ninteresting could condescend to a trick of even so mild a complexion as\nthat. He wanted to think her the soul of all that was tender, and noble,\nand kind. The pleasure of setting himself to win a minister's goodwill\nwas a little tarnished now.\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\nThat evening Somerset was so preoccupied with these things that he left\nall his sketching implements out-of-doors in the castle grounds. The\nnext morning he hastened thither to secure them from being stolen or\nspoiled. Meanwhile he was hoping to have an opportunity of rectifying\nPaula's mistake about his personality, which, having served a very good\npurpose in introducing them to a mutual conversation, might possibly be\nmade just as agreeable as a thing to be explained away.\n\nHe fetched his drawing instruments, rods, sketching-blocks and other\narticles from the field where they had lain, and was passing under the\nwalls with them in his hands, when there emerged from the outer archway\nan open landau, drawn by a pair of black horses of fine action and\nobviously strong pedigree, in which Paula was seated, under the shade of\na white parasol with black and white ribbons fluttering on the summit.\nThe morning sun sparkled on the equipage, its newness being made all the\nmore noticeable by the ragged old arch behind.\n\nShe bowed to Somerset in a way which might have been meant to express\nthat she had discovered her mistake; but there was no embarrassment in\nher manner, and the carriage bore her away without her making any sign\nfor checking it. He had not been walking towards the castle entrance,\nand she could not be supposed to know that it was his intention to enter\nthat day.\n\nShe had looked such a bud of youth and promise that his disappointment\nat her departure showed itself in his face as he observed her. However,\nhe went on his way, entered a turret, ascended to the leads of the great\ntower, and stepped out.\n\nFrom this elevated position he could still see the carriage and the\nwhite surface of Paula's parasol in the glowing sun. While he watched\nthe landau stopped, and in a few moments the horses were turned, the\nwheels and the panels flashed, and the carriage came bowling along\ntowards the castle again.\n\nSomerset descended the stone stairs. Before he had quite got to the\nbottom he saw Miss De Stancy standing in the outer hall.\n\n'When did you come, Mr. Somerset?' she gaily said, looking up surprised.\n'How industrious you are to be at work so regularly every day! We didn't\nthink you would be here to-day: Paula has gone to a vegetable show at\nMarkton, and I am going to join her there soon.'\n\n'O! gone to a vegetable show. But I think she has altered her--'\n\nAt this moment the noise of the carriage was heard in the ward, and\nafter a few seconds Miss Power came in--Somerset being invisible from\nthe door where she stood.\n\n'O Paula, what has brought you back?' said Miss De Stancy.\n\n'I have forgotten something.'\n\n'Mr. Somerset is here. Will you not speak to him?'\n\nSomerset came forward, and Miss De Stancy presented him to her friend.\nMr. Somerset acknowledged the pleasure by a respectful inclination of\nhis person, and said some words about the meeting yesterday.\n\n'Yes,' said Miss Power, with a serene deliberateness quite noteworthy in\na girl of her age; 'I have seen it all since. I was mistaken about you,\nwas I not? Mr. Somerset, I am glad to welcome you here, both as a friend\nof Miss De Stancy's family, and as the son of your father--which is\nindeed quite a sufficient introduction anywhere.'\n\n'You have two pictures painted by Mr. Somerset's father, have you not?\nI have already told him about them,' said Miss De Stancy. 'Perhaps Mr.\nSomerset would like to see them if they are unpacked?'\n\nAs Somerset had from his infancy suffered from a plethora of those\nproductions, excellent as they were, he did not reply quite so eagerly\nas Miss De Stancy seemed to expect to her kind suggestion, and Paula\nremarked to him, 'You will stay to lunch? Do order it at your own time,\nif our hour should not be convenient.'\n\nHer voice was a voice of low note, in quality that of a flute at\nthe grave end of its gamut. If she sang, she was a pure contralto\nunmistakably.\n\n'I am making use of the permission you have been good enough to grant\nme--of sketching what is valuable within these walls.'\n\n'Yes, of course, I am willing for anybody to come. People hold these\nplaces in trust for the nation, in one sense. You lift your hands,\nCharlotte; I see I have not convinced you on that point yet.'\n\nMiss De Stancy laughed, and said something to no purpose.\n\nSomehow Miss Power seemed not only more woman than Miss De Stancy, but\nmore woman than Somerset was man; and yet in years she was inferior to\nboth. Though becomingly girlish and modest, she appeared to possess a\ngood deal of composure, which was well expressed by the shaded light of\nher eyes.\n\n'You have then met Mr. Somerset before?' said Charlotte.\n\n'He was kind enough to deliver an address in my defence yesterday. I\nsuppose I seemed quite unable to defend myself.'\n\n'O no!' said he. When a few more words had passed she turned to Miss De\nStancy and spoke of some domestic matter, upon which Somerset withdrew,\nPaula accompanying his exit with a remark that she hoped to see him\nagain a little later in the day.\n\nSomerset retired to the chambers of antique lumber, keeping an eye\nupon the windows to see if she re-entered the carriage and resumed her\njourney to Markton. But when the horses had been standing a long time\nthe carriage was driven round to the stables. Then she was not going to\nthe vegetable show. That was rather curious, seeing that she had only\ncome back for something forgotten.\n\nThese queries and thoughts occupied the mind of Somerset until the bell\nwas rung for luncheon. Owing to the very dusty condition in which he\nfound himself after his morning's labours among the old carvings he was\nrather late in getting downstairs, and seeing that the rest had gone in\nhe went straight to the dining-hall.\n\nThe population of the castle had increased in his absence. There were\nassembled Paula and her friend Charlotte; a bearded man some years older\nthan himself, with a cold grey eye, who was cursorily introduced to him\nin sitting down as Mr. Havill, an architect of Markton; also an\nelderly lady of dignified aspect, in a black satin dress, of which she\napparently had a very high opinion. This lady, who seemed to be a mere\ndummy in the establishment, was, as he now learnt, Mrs. Goodman by\nname, a widow of a recently deceased gentleman, and aunt to Paula--the\nidentical aunt who had smuggled Paula into a church in her helpless\ninfancy, and had her christened without her parents' knowledge. Having\nbeen left in narrow circumstances by her husband, she was at present\nliving with Miss Power as chaperon and adviser on practical matters--in\na word, as ballast to the management. Beyond her Somerset discerned\nhis new acquaintance Mr. Woodwell, who on sight of Somerset was for\nhastening up to him and performing a laboured shaking of hands in\nearnest recognition.\n\nPaula had just come in from the garden, and was carelessly laying down\nher large shady hat as he entered. Her dress, a figured material in\nblack and white, was short, allowing her feet to appear. There was\nsomething in her look, and in the style of her corsage, which reminded\nhim of several of the bygone beauties in the gallery. The thought for a\nmoment crossed his mind that she might have been imitating one of them.\n\n'Fine old screen, sir!' said Mr. Havill, in a long-drawn voice across\nthe table when they were seated, pointing in the direction of the\ntraceried oak division between the dining-hall and a vestibule at the\nend. 'As good a piece of fourteenth-century work as you shall see in\nthis part of the country.'\n\n'You mean fifteenth century, of course?' said Somerset.\n\nHavill was silent. 'You are one of the profession, perhaps?' asked the\nlatter, after a while.\n\n'You mean that I am an architect?' said Somerset. 'Yes.'\n\n'Ah--one of my own honoured vocation.' Havill's face had been not\nunpleasant until this moment, when he smiled; whereupon there instantly\ngleamed over him a phase of meanness, remaining until the smile died\naway.\n\nHavill continued, with slow watchfulness:--\n\n'What enormous sacrileges are committed by the builders every day, I\nobserve! I was driving yesterday to Toneborough where I am erecting a\ntown-hall, and passing through a village on my way I saw the workmen\npulling down a chancel-wall in which they found imbedded a unique\nspecimen of Perpendicular work--a capital from some old arcade--the\nmouldings wonderfully undercut. They were smashing it up as filling-in\nfor the new wall.'\n\n'It must have been unique,' said Somerset, in the too-readily\ncontroversial tone of the educated young man who has yet to learn\ndiplomacy. 'I have never seen much undercutting in Perpendicular\nstone-work; nor anybody else, I think.'\n\n'O yes--lots of it!' said Mr. Havill, nettled.\n\nPaula looked from one to the other. 'Which am I to take as guide?' she\nasked. 'Are Perpendicular capitals undercut, as you call it, Mr. Havill,\nor no?'\n\n'It depends upon circumstances,' said Mr. Havill.\n\nBut Somerset had answered at the same time: 'There is seldom or never\nany marked undercutting in moulded work later than the middle of the\nfourteenth century.'\n\nHavill looked keenly at Somerset for a time: then he turned to Paula:\n'As regards that fine Saxon vaulting you did me the honour to consult me\nabout the other day, I should advise taking out some of the old stones\nand reinstating new ones exactly like them.'\n\n'But the new ones won't be Saxon,' said Paula. 'And then in time to\ncome, when I have passed away, and those stones have become stained like\nthe rest, people will be deceived. I should prefer an honest patch to\nany such make-believe of Saxon relics.'\n\nAs she concluded she let her eyes rest on Somerset for a moment, as if\nto ask him to side with her. Much as he liked talking to Paula, he\nwould have preferred not to enter into this discussion with another\nprofessional man, even though that man were a spurious article; but he\nwas led on to enthusiasm by a sudden pang of regret at finding that the\nmasterly workmanship in this fine castle was likely to be tinkered and\nspoilt by such a man as Havill.\n\n'You will deceive nobody into believing that anything is Saxon here,' he\nsaid warmly. 'There is not a square inch of Saxon work, as it is called,\nin the whole castle.'\n\nPaula, in doubt, looked to Mr. Havill.\n\n'O yes, sir; you are quite mistaken,' said that gentleman slowly. 'Every\nstone of those lower vaults was reared in Saxon times.'\n\n'I can assure you,' said Somerset deferentially, but firmly, 'that there\nis not an arch or wall in this castle of a date anterior to the year\n1100; no one whose attention has ever been given to the study of\narchitectural details of that age can be of a different opinion.'\n\n'I have studied architecture, and I am of a different opinion. I have\nthe best reason in the world for the difference, for I have history\nherself on my side. What will you say when I tell you that it is a\nrecorded fact that this was used as a castle by the Romans, and that it\nis mentioned in Domesday as a building of long standing?'\n\n'I shall say that has nothing to do with it,' replied the young man.\n'I don't deny that there may have been a castle here in the time of\nthe Romans: what I say is, that none of the architecture we now see was\nstanding at that date.'\n\nThere was a silence of a minute, disturbed only by a murmured dialogue\nbetween Mrs. Goodman and the minister, during which Paula was looking\nthoughtfully on the table as if framing a question.\n\n'Can it be,' she said to Somerset, 'that such certainty has been reached\nin the study of architectural dates? Now, would you really risk anything\non your belief? Would you agree to be shut up in the vaults and fed upon\nbread and water for a week if I could prove you wrong?'\n\n'Willingly,' said Somerset. 'The date of those towers and arches is\nmatter of absolute certainty from the details. That they should have\nbeen built before the Conquest is as unlikely as, say, that the\nrustiest old gun with a percussion lock should be older than the date of\nWaterloo.'\n\n'How I wish I knew something precise of an art which makes one so\nindependent of written history!'\n\nMr. Havill had lapsed into a mannerly silence that was only sullenness\ndisguised. Paula turned her conversation to Miss De Stancy, who had\nsimply looked from one to the other during the discussion, though she\nmight have been supposed to have a prescriptive right to a few remarks\non the matter. A commonplace talk ensued, till Havill, who had not\njoined in it, privately began at Somerset again with a mixed manner of\ncordiality, contempt, and misgiving.\n\n'You have a practice, I suppose, sir?'\n\n'I am not in practice just yet.'\n\n'Just beginning?'\n\n'I am about to begin.'\n\n'In London, or near here?'\n\n'In London probably.'\n\n'H'm.... I am practising in Markton.'\n\n'Indeed. Have you been at it long?'\n\n'Not particularly. I designed the chapel built by this lady's late\nfather; it was my first undertaking--I owe my start, in fact, to Mr.\nPower. Ever build a chapel?'\n\n'Never. I have sketched a good many churches.'\n\n'Ah--there we differ. I didn't do much sketching in my youth, nor have I\ntime for it now. Sketching and building are two different things, to my\nmind. I was not brought up to the profession--got into it through sheer\nlove of it. I began as a landscape gardener, then I became a builder,\nthen I was a road contractor. Every architect might do worse than have\nsome such experience. But nowadays 'tis the men who can draw pretty\npictures who get recommended, not the practical men. Young prigs win\nInstitute medals for a pretty design or two which, if anybody tried\nto build them, would fall down like a house of cards; then they get\ntravelling studentships and what not, and then they start as architects\nof some new school or other, and think they are the masters of us\nexperienced ones.'\n\nWhile Somerset was reflecting how far this statement was true, he heard\nthe voice of Paula inquiring, 'Who can he be?'\n\nHer eyes were bent on the window. Looking out, Somerset saw in the mead\nbeyond the dry ditch, Dare, with his photographic apparatus.\n\n'He is the young gentleman who called about taking views of the castle,'\nsaid Charlotte.\n\n'O yes--I remember; it is quite right. He met me in the village and\nasked me to suggest him some views. I thought him a respectable young\nfellow.'\n\n'I think he is a Canadian,' said Somerset.\n\n'No,' said Paula, 'he is from the East--at least he implied so to me.'\n\n'There is Italian blood in him,' said Charlotte brightly. 'For he spoke\nto me with an Italian accent. But I can't think whether he is a boy or a\nman.'\n\n'It is to be earnestly hoped that the gentleman does not prevaricate,'\nsaid the minister, for the first time attracted by the subject. 'I\naccidentally met him in the lane, and he said something to me about\nhaving lived in Malta. I think it was Malta, or Gibraltar--even if he\ndid not say that he was born there.'\n\n'His manners are no credit to his nationality,' observed Mrs. Goodman,\nalso speaking publicly for the first time. 'He asked me this morning to\nsend him out a pail of water for his process, and before I had turned\naway he began whistling. I don't like whistlers.'\n\n'Then it appears,' said Somerset, 'that he is a being of no age, no\nnationality, and no behaviour.'\n\n'A complete negative,' added Havill, brightening into a civil sneer.\n'That is, he would be, if he were not a maker of negatives well known in\nMarkton.'\n\n'Not well known, Mr. Havill,' answered Mrs. Goodman firmly. 'For I lived\nin Markton for thirty years ending three months ago, and he was never\nheard of in my time.'\n\n'He is something like you, Charlotte,' said Paula, smiling playfully on\nher companion.\n\nAll the men looked at Charlotte, on whose face a delicate nervous blush\nthereupon made its appearance.\n\n''Pon my word there is a likeness, now I think of it,' said Havill.\n\nPaula bent down to Charlotte and whispered: 'Forgive my rudeness, dear.\nHe is not a nice enough person to be like you. He is really more like\none or other of the old pictures about the house. I forget which, and\nreally it does not matter.'\n\n'People's features fall naturally into groups and classes,' remarked\nSomerset. 'To an observant person they often repeat themselves; though\nto a careless eye they seem infinite in their differences.'\n\nThe conversation flagged, and they idly observed the figure of the\ncosmopolite Dare as he walked round his instrument in the mead and\nbusied himself with an arrangement of curtains and lenses, occasionally\nwithdrawing a few steps, and looking contemplatively at the towers and\nwalls.\n\n\n\nIX.\n\nSomerset returned to the top of the great tower with a vague\nconsciousness that he was going to do something up there--perhaps sketch\na general plan of the structure. But he began to discern that this\nStancy-Castle episode in his studies of Gothic architecture might be\nless useful than ornamental to him as a professional man, though it was\ntoo agreeable to be abandoned. Finding after a while that his drawing\nprogressed but slowly, by reason of infinite joyful thoughts more allied\nto his nature than to his art, he relinquished rule and compass, and\nentered one of the two turrets opening on the roof. It was not the\nstaircase by which he had ascended, and he proceeded to explore its\nlower part. Entering from the blaze of light without, and imagining the\nstairs to descend as usual, he became aware after a few steps that\nthere was suddenly nothing to tread on, and found himself precipitated\ndownwards to a distance of several feet.\n\nArrived at the bottom, he was conscious of the happy fact that he had\nnot seriously hurt himself, though his leg was twisted awkwardly. Next\nhe perceived that the stone steps had been removed from the turret, so\nthat he had dropped into it as into a dry well; that, owing to its being\nwalled up below, there was no door of exit on either side of him; that\nhe was, in short, a prisoner.\n\nPlacing himself in a more comfortable position he calmly considered\nthe best means of getting out, or of making his condition known. For\na moment he tried to drag himself up by his arm, but it was a hopeless\nattempt, the height to the first step being far too great.\n\nHe next looked round at a lower level. Not far from his left elbow, in\nthe concave of the outer wall, was a slit for the admission of light,\nand he perceived at once that through this slit alone lay his chance of\ncommunicating with the outer world. At first it seemed as if it were to\nbe done by shouting, but when he learnt what little effect was produced\nby his voice in the midst of such a mass of masonry, his heart failed\nhim for a moment. Yet, as either Paula or Miss De Stancy would probably\nguess his visit to the top of the tower, there was no cause for terror,\nif some for alarm.\n\nHe put his handkerchief through the window-slit, so that it fluttered\noutside, and, fixing it in its place by a large stone drawn from the\nloose ones around him, awaited succour as best he could. To begin this\ncourse of procedure was easy, but to abide in patience till it should\nproduce fruit was an irksome task. As nearly as he could guess--for his\nwatch had been stopped by the fall--it was now about four o'clock, and\nit would be scarcely possible for evening to approach without some\neye or other noticing the white signal. So Somerset waited, his eyes\nlingering on the little world of objects around him, till they all\nbecame quite familiar. Spiders'-webs in plenty were there, and one in\nparticular just before him was in full use as a snare, stretching across\nthe arch of the window, with radiating threads as its ribs. Somerset\nhad plenty of time, and he counted their number--fifteen. He remained\nso silent that the owner of this elaborate structure soon forgot the\ndisturbance which had resulted in the breaking of his diagonal ties,\nand crept out from the corner to mend them. In watching the process,\nSomerset noticed that on the stonework behind the web sundry names and\ninitials had been cut by explorers in years gone by. Among these antique\ninscriptions he observed two bright and clean ones, consisting of the\nwords 'De Stancy' and 'W. Dare,' crossing each other at right angles.\nFrom the state of the stone they could not have been cut more than a\nmonth before this date, and, musing on the circumstance, Somerset passed\nthe time until the sun reached the slit in that side of the tower,\nwhere, beginning by throwing in a streak of fire as narrow as a\ncorn-stalk, it enlarged its width till the dusty nook was flooded with\ncheerful light. It disclosed something lying in the corner, which on\nexamination proved to be a dry bone. Whether it was human, or had come\nfrom the castle larder in bygone times, he could not tell. One bone was\nnot a whole skeleton, but it made him think of Ginevra of Modena, the\nheroine of the Mistletoe Bough, and other cribbed and confined wretches,\nwho had fallen into such traps and been discovered after a cycle of\nyears.\n\nThe sun's rays had travelled some way round the interior when Somerset's\nwaiting ears were at last attracted by footsteps above, each tread being\nbrought down by the hollow turret with great fidelity. He hoped that\nwith these sounds would arise that of a soft voice he had begun to like\nwell. Indeed, during the solitary hour or two of his waiting here he had\npictured Paula straying alone on the terrace of the castle, looking\nup, noting his signal, and ascending to deliver him from his painful\nposition by her own exertions. It seemed that at length his dream had\nbeen verified. The footsteps approached the opening of the turret;\nand, attracted by the call which Somerset now raised, began to descend\ntowards him. In a moment, not Paula's face, but that of a dreary footman\nof her household, looked into the hole.\n\nSomerset mastered his disappointment, and the man speedily fetched a\nladder, by which means the prisoner of two hours ascended to the roof\nin safety. During the process he ventured to ask for the ladies of the\nhouse, and learnt that they had gone out for a drive together.\n\nBefore he left the castle, however, they had returned, a circumstance\nunexpectedly made known to him by his receiving a message from\nMiss Power, to the effect that she would be glad to see him at his\nconvenience. Wondering what it could possibly mean, he followed the\nmessenger to her room--a small modern library in the Jacobean wing of\nthe house, adjoining that in which the telegraph stood. She was alone,\nsitting behind a table littered with letters and sketches, and looking\nfresh from her drive. Perhaps it was because he had been shut up in that\ndismal dungeon all the afternoon that he felt something in her presence\nwhich at the same time charmed and refreshed him.\n\nShe signified that he was to sit down; but finding that he was going\nto place himself on a straight-backed chair some distance off she said,\n'Will you sit nearer to me?' and then, as if rather oppressed by her\ndignity, she left her own chair of business and seated herself at\nease on an ottoman which was among the diversified furniture of the\napartment.\n\n'I want to consult you professionally,' she went on. 'I have been much\nimpressed by your great knowledge of castellated architecture. Will you\nsit in that leather chair at the table, as you may have to take notes?'\n\nThe young man assented, expressed his gratification, and went to the\nchair she designated.\n\n'But, Mr. Somerset,' she continued, from the ottoman--the width of the\ntable only dividing them--'I first should just like to know, and I trust\nyou will excuse my inquiry, if you are an architect in practice, or only\nas yet studying for the profession?'\n\n'I am just going to practise. I open my office on the first of January\nnext,' he answered.\n\n'You would not mind having me as a client--your first client?' She\nlooked curiously from her sideway face across the table as she said\nthis.\n\n'Can you ask it!' said Somerset warmly. 'What are you going to build?'\n\n'I am going to restore the castle.'\n\n'What, all of it?' said Somerset, astonished at the audacity of such an\nundertaking.\n\n'Not the parts that are absolutely ruinous: the walls battered by the\nParliament artillery had better remain as they are, I suppose. But we\nhave begun wrong; it is I who should ask you, not you me.... I fear,'\nshe went on, in that low note which was somewhat difficult to catch at\na distance, 'I fear what the antiquarians will say if I am not very\ncareful. They come here a great deal in summer and if I were to do the\nwork wrong they would put my name in the papers as a dreadful person.\nBut I must live here, as I have no other house, except the one in\nLondon, and hence I must make the place habitable. I do hope I can trust\nto your judgment?'\n\n'I hope so,' he said, with diffidence, for, far from having much\nprofessional confidence, he often mistrusted himself. 'I am a Fellow\nof the Society of Antiquaries, and a Member of the Institute of British\nArchitects--not a Fellow of that body yet, though I soon shall be.'\n\n'Then I am sure you must be trustworthy,' she said, with enthusiasm.\n'Well, what am I to do?--How do we begin?'\n\nSomerset began to feel more professional, what with the business\nchair and the table, and the writing-paper, notwithstanding that these\narticles, and the room they were in, were hers instead of his; and an\nevenness of manner which he had momentarily lost returned to him. 'The\nvery first step,' he said, 'is to decide upon the outlay--what is it to\ncost?'\n\nHe faltered a little, for it seemed to disturb the softness of their\nrelationship to talk thus of hard cash. But her sympathy with his\nfeeling was apparently not great, and she said, 'The expenditure shall\nbe what you advise.'\n\n'What a heavenly client!' he thought. 'But you must just give some\nidea,' he said gently. 'For the fact is, any sum almost may be spent\non such a building: five thousand, ten thousand, twenty thousand, fifty\nthousand, a hundred thousand.'\n\n'I want it done well; so suppose we say a hundred thousand? My father's\nsolicitor--my solicitor now--says I may go to a hundred thousand without\nextravagance, if the expenditure is scattered over two or three years.'\n\nSomerset looked round for a pen. With quickness of insight she knew\nwhat he wanted, and signified where one could be found. He wrote down in\nlarge figures--\n\n     100,000.\n\nIt was more than he had expected; and for a young man just beginning\npractice, the opportunity of playing with another person's money to that\nextent would afford an exceptionally handsome opening, not so much\nfrom the commission it represented, as from the attention that would be\nbestowed by the art-world on such an undertaking.\n\nPaula had sunk into a reverie. 'I was intending to intrust the work\nto Mr. Havill, a local architect,' she said. 'But I gathered from\nhis conversation with you to-day that his ignorance of styles might\ncompromise me very seriously. In short, though my father employed him\nin one or two little matters, it would not be right--even a morally\nculpable thing--to place such an historically valuable building in his\nhands.'\n\n'Has Mr. Havill ever been led to expect the commission?' he asked.\n\n'He may have guessed that he would have it. I have spoken of my\nintention to him more than once.'\n\nSomerset thought over his conversation with Havill. Well, he did not\nlike Havill personally; and he had strong reasons for suspecting that in\nthe matter of architecture Havill was a quack. But was it quite generous\nto step in thus, and take away what would be a golden opportunity to\nsuch a man of making both ends meet comfortably for some years to come,\nwithout giving him at least one chance? He reflected a little longer,\nand then spoke out his feeling.\n\n'I venture to propose a slightly modified arrangement,' he said.\n'Instead of committing the whole undertaking to my hands without better\nproof of my ability to carry it out than you have at present, let there\nbe a competition between Mr. Havill and myself--let our rival plans for\nthe restoration and enlargement be submitted to a committee of the Royal\nInstitute of British Architects--and let the choice rest with them,\nsubject of course to your approval.'\n\n'It is indeed generous of you to suggest it.' She looked thoughtfully\nat him; he appeared to strike her in a new light. 'You really recommend\nit?' The fairness which had prompted his words seemed to incline her\nstill more than before to resign herself entirely to him in the matter.\n\n'I do,' said Somerset deliberately.\n\n'I will think of it, since you wish it. And now, what general idea have\nyou of the plan to adopt? I do not positively agree to your suggestion\nas yet, so I may perhaps ask the question.'\n\nSomerset, being by this time familiar with the general plan of the\ncastle, took out his pencil and made a rough sketch. While he was doing\nit she rose, and coming to the back of his chair, bent over him in\nsilence.\n\n'Ah, I begin to see your conception,' she murmured; and the breath of\nher words fanned his ear. He finished the sketch, and held it up to her,\nsaying--\n\n'I would suggest that you walk over the building with Mr. Havill and\nmyself, and detail your ideas to us on each portion.'\n\n'Is it necessary?'\n\n'Clients mostly do it.'\n\n'I will, then. But it is too late for me this evening. Please meet me\nto-morrow at ten.'\n\n\n\nX.\n\nAt ten o'clock they met in the same room, Paula appearing in a straw hat\nhaving a bent-up brim lined with plaited silk, so that it surrounded\nher forehead like a nimbus; and Somerset armed with sketch-book,\nmeasuring-rod, and other apparatus of his craft.\n\n'And Mr. Havill?' said the young man.\n\n'I have not decided to employ him: if I do he shall go round with me\nindependently of you,' she replied rather brusquely.\n\nSomerset was by no means sorry to hear this. His duty to Havill was\ndone.\n\n'And now,' she said, as they walked on together through the passages, 'I\nmust tell you that I am not a mediaevalist myself; and perhaps that's a\npity.'\n\n'What are you?'\n\n'I am Greek--that's why I don't wish to influence your design.'\n\nSomerset, as they proceeded, pointed out where roofs had been and\nshould be again, where gables had been pulled down, and where floors had\nvanished, showing her how to reconstruct their details from marks in the\nwalls, much as a comparative anatomist reconstructs an antediluvian from\nfragmentary bones and teeth. She appeared to be interested, listened\nattentively, but said little in reply. They were ultimately in a long\nnarrow passage, indifferently lighted, when Somerset, treading on a\nloose stone, felt a twinge of weakness in one knee, and knew in a moment\nthat it was the result of the twist given by his yesterday's fall. He\npaused, leaning against the wall.\n\n'What is it?' said Paula, with a sudden timidity in her voice.\n\n'I slipped down yesterday,' he said. 'It will be right in a moment.'\n\n'I--can I help you?' said Paula. But she did not come near him; indeed,\nshe withdrew a little. She looked up the passage, and down the passage,\nand became conscious that it was long and gloomy, and that nobody was\nnear. A curious coy uneasiness seemed to take possession of her. Whether\nshe thought, for the first time, that she had made a mistake--that to\nwander about the castle alone with him was compromising, or whether\nit was the mere shy instinct of maidenhood, nobody knows; but she said\nsuddenly, 'I will get something for you, and return in a few minutes.'\n\n'Pray don't--it has quite passed!' he said, stepping out again.\n\nBut Paula had vanished. When she came back it was in the rear of\nCharlotte De Stancy. Miss De Stancy had a tumbler in one hand, half full\nof wine, which she offered him; Paula remaining in the background.\n\nHe took the glass, and, to satisfy his companions, drank a mouthful or\ntwo, though there was really nothing whatever the matter with him beyond\nthe slight ache above mentioned. Charlotte was going to retire, but\nPaula said, quite anxiously, 'You will stay with me, Charlotte, won't\nyou? Surely you are interested in what I am doing?'\n\n'What is it?' said Miss De Stancy.\n\n'Planning how to mend and enlarge the castle. Tell Mr. Somerset what I\nwant done in the quadrangle--you know quite well--and I will walk on.'\n\nShe walked on; but instead of talking on the subject as directed,\nCharlotte and Somerset followed chatting on indifferent matters. They\ncame to an inner court and found Paula standing there.\n\nShe met Miss De Stancy with a smile. 'Did you explain?' she asked.\n\n'I have not explained yet.' Paula seated herself on a stone bench, and\nCharlotte went on: 'Miss Power thought of making a Greek court of this.\nBut she will not tell you so herself, because it seems such dreadful\nanachronism.\n\n'I said I would not tell any architect myself,' interposed Paula\ncorrectingly. 'I did not then know that he would be Mr. Somerset.'\n\n'It is rather startling,' said Somerset.\n\n'A Greek colonnade all round, you said, Paula,' continued her less\nreticent companion. 'A peristyle you called it--you saw it in a book,\ndon't you remember?--and then you were going to have a fountain in the\nmiddle, and statues like those in the British Museum.'\n\n'I did say so,' remarked Paula, pulling the leaves from a young\nsycamore-tree that had sprung up between the joints of the paving.\n\nFrom the spot where they sat they could see over the roofs the upper\npart of the great tower wherein Somerset had met with his misadventure.\nThe tower stood boldly up in the sun, and from one of the slits in the\ncorner something white waved in the breeze.\n\n'What can that be?' said Charlotte. 'Is it the fluff of owls, or a\nhandkerchief?'\n\n'It is my handkerchief,' Somerset answered. 'I fixed it there with a\nstone to attract attention, and forgot to take it away.'\n\nAll three looked up at the handkerchief with interest. 'Why did you want\nto attract attention?' said Paula.\n\n'O, I fell into the turret; but I got out very easily.'\n\n'O Paula,' said Charlotte, turning to her friend, 'that must be the\nplace where the man fell in, years ago, and was starved to death!'\n\n'Starved to death?' said Paula.\n\n'They say so. O Mr. Somerset, what an escape!' And Charlotte De Stancy\nwalked away to a point from which she could get a better view of the\ntreacherous turret.\n\n'Whom did you think to attract?' asked Paula, after a pause.\n\n'I thought you might see it.'\n\n'Me personally?' And, blushing faintly, her eyes rested upon him.\n\n'I hoped for anybody. I thought of you,' said Somerset.\n\nShe did not continue. In a moment she arose and went across to Miss\nDe Stancy. 'Don't YOU go falling down and becoming a skeleton,'\nshe said--Somerset overheard the words, though Paula was unaware of\nit--after which she clasped her fingers behind Charlotte's neck, and\nsmiled tenderly in her face.\n\nIt seemed to be quite unconsciously done, and Somerset thought it a\nvery beautiful action. Presently Paula returned to him and said, 'Mr.\nSomerset, I think we have had enough architecture for to-day.'\n\nThe two women then wished him good-morning and went away. Somerset,\nfeeling that he had now every reason for prowling about the castle,\nremained near the spot, endeavouring to evolve some plan of\nprocedure for the project entertained by the beautiful owner of those\nweather-scathed walls. But for a long time the mental perspective of his\nnew position so excited the emotional side of his nature that he could\nnot concentrate it on feet and inches. As Paula's architect (supposing\nHavill not to be admitted as a competitor), he must of necessity be in\nconstant communication with her for a space of two or three years to\ncome; and particularly during the next few months. She, doubtless,\ncherished far too ambitious views of her career to feel any personal\ninterest in this enforced relationship with him; but he would be at\nliberty to feel what he chose: and to be the victim of an unrequited\npassion, while afforded such splendid opportunities of communion with\nthe one beloved, deprived that passion of its most deplorable features.\nAccessibility is a great point in matters of love, and perhaps of the\ntwo there is less misery in loving without return a goddess who is to\nbe seen and spoken to every day, than in having an affection tenderly\nreciprocated by one always hopelessly removed.\n\nWith this view of having to spend a considerable time in the\nneighbourhood Somerset shifted his quarters that afternoon from the\nlittle inn at Sleeping-Green to a larger one at Markton. He required\nmore rooms in which to carry out Paula's instructions than the former\nplace afforded, and a more central position. Having reached and dined\nat Markton he found the evening tedious, and again strolled out in the\ndirection of the castle.\n\nWhen he reached it the light was declining, and a solemn stillness\noverspread the pile. The great tower was in full view. That spot of\nwhite which looked like a pigeon fluttering from the loophole was his\nhandkerchief, still hanging in the place where he had left it. His\neyes yet lingered on the walls when he noticed, with surprise, that the\nhandkerchief suddenly vanished.\n\nBelieving that the breezes, though weak below, might have been strong\nenough at that height to blow it into the turret, and in no hurry to get\noff the premises, he leisurely climbed up to find it, ascending by\nthe second staircase, crossing the roof, and going to the top of the\ntreacherous turret. The ladder by which he had escaped still stood\nwithin it, and beside the ladder he beheld the dim outline of a woman,\nin a meditative attitude, holding his handkerchief in her hand.\n\nSomerset softly withdrew. When he had reached the ground he looked up.\nA girlish form was standing at the top of the tower looking over the\nparapet upon him--possibly not seeing him, for it was dark on the lawn.\nIt was either Miss De Stancy or Paula; one of them had gone there alone\nfor his handkerchief and had remained awhile, pondering on his escape.\nBut which? 'If I were not a faint-heart I should run all risk and wave\nmy hat or kiss my hand to her, whoever she is,' he thought. But he did\nnot do either.\n\nSo he lingered about silently in the shades, and then thought of\nstrolling to his rooms at Markton. Just at leaving, as he passed under\nthe inhabited wing, whence one or two lights now blinked, he heard a\npiano, and a voice singing 'The Mistletoe Bough.' The song had probably\nbeen suggested to the romantic fancy of the singer by her visit to the\nscene of his captivity.\n\n\n\nXI.\n\nThe identity of the lady whom he had seen on the tower and afterwards\nheard singing was established the next day.\n\n'I have been thinking,' said Miss Power, on meeting him, 'that you may\nrequire a studio on the premises. If so, the room I showed you yesterday\nis at your service. If I employ Mr. Havill to compete with you I will\noffer him a similar one.'\n\nSomerset did not decline; and she added, 'In the same room you will find\nthe handkerchief that was left on the tower.'\n\n'Ah, I saw that it was gone. Somebody brought it down?'\n\n'I did,' she shyly remarked, looking up for a second under her shady\nhat-brim.\n\n'I am much obliged to you.'\n\n'O no. I went up last night to see where the accident happened, and\nthere I found it. When you came up were you in search of it, or did you\nwant me?'\n\n'Then she saw me,' he thought. 'I went for the handkerchief only; I was\nnot aware that you were there,' he answered simply. And he involuntarily\nsighed.\n\nIt was very soft, but she might have heard him, for there was interest\nin her voice as she continued, 'Did you see me before you went back?'\n\n'I did not know it was you; I saw that some lady was there, and I would\nnot disturb her. I wondered all the evening if it were you.'\n\nPaula hastened to explain: 'We understood that you would stay to dinner,\nand as you did not come in we wondered where you were. That made me\nthink of your accident, and after dinner I went up to the place where it\nhappened.'\n\nSomerset almost wished she had not explained so lucidly.\n\nAnd now followed the piquant days to which his position as her\narchitect, or, at worst, as one of her two architects, naturally led.\nHis anticipations were for once surpassed by the reality. Perhaps\nSomerset's inherent unfitness for a professional life under ordinary\ncircumstances was only proved by his great zest for it now. Had he been\nin regular practice, with numerous other clients, instead of having\nmerely made a start with this one, he would have totally neglected their\nbusiness in his exclusive attention to Paula's.\n\nThe idea of a competition between Somerset and Havill had been highly\napproved by Paula's solicitor, but she would not assent to it as yet,\nseeming quite vexed that Somerset should not have taken the good the\ngods provided without questioning her justice to Havill. The room she\nhad offered him was prepared as a studio. Drawing-boards and Whatman's\npaper were sent for, and in a few days Somerset began serious labour.\nHis first requirement was a clerk or two, to do the drudgery of\nmeasuring and figuring; but for the present he preferred to sketch\nalone. Sometimes, in measuring the outworks of the castle, he ran\nagainst Havill strolling about with no apparent object, who bestowed on\nhim an envious nod, and passed by.\n\n'I hope you will not make your sketches,' she said, looking in upon him\none day, 'and then go away to your studio in London and think of your\nother buildings and forget mine. I am in haste to begin, and wish you\nnot to neglect me.'\n\n'I have no other building to think of,' said Somerset, rising and\nplacing a chair for her. 'I had not begun practice, as you may know. I\nhave nothing else in hand but your castle.'\n\n'I suppose I ought not to say I am glad of it; but it is an advantage\nto have an architect all to one's self. The architect whom I at first\nthought of told me before I knew you that if I placed the castle in his\nhands he would undertake no other commission till its completion.'\n\n'I agree to the same,' said Somerset.\n\n'I don't wish to bind you. But I hinder you now--do pray go on without\nreference to me. When will there be some drawing for me to see?'\n\n'I will take care that it shall be soon.'\n\nHe had a metallic tape in his hand, and went out of the room to take\nsome dimension in the corridor. The assistant for whom he had advertised\nhad not arrived, and he attempted to fix the end of the tape by sticking\nhis penknife through the ring into the wall. Paula looked on at a\ndistance.\n\n'I will hold it,' she said.\n\nShe went to the required corner and held the end in its place. She had\ntaken it the wrong way, and Somerset went over and placed it properly in\nher fingers, carefully avoiding to touch them. She obediently raised\nher hand to the corner again, and stood till he had finished, when she\nasked, 'Is that all?'\n\n'That is all,' said Somerset. 'Thank you.' Without further speech she\nlooked at his sketch-book, while he marked down the lines just acquired.\n\n'You said the other day,' she observed, 'that early Gothic work might be\nknown by the under-cutting, or something to that effect. I have looked\nin Rickman and the Oxford Glossary, but I cannot quite understand what\nyou meant.'\n\nIt was only too probable to her lover, from the way in which she\nturned to him, that she HAD looked in Rickman and the Glossary, and was\nthinking of nothing in the world but of the subject of her inquiry.\n\n'I can show you, by actual example, if you will come to the chapel?' he\nreturned hesitatingly.\n\n'Don't go on purpose to show me--when you are there on your own account\nI will come in.'\n\n'I shall be there in half-an-hour.'\n\n'Very well,' said Paula. She looked out of a window, and, seeing Miss De\nStancy on the terrace, left him.\n\nSomerset stood thinking of what he had said. He had no occasion whatever\nto go into the chapel of the castle that day. He had been tempted by her\nwords to say he would be there, and 'half-an-hour' had come to his lips\nalmost without his knowledge. This community of interest--if it were not\nanything more tender--was growing serious. What had passed between them\namounted to an appointment; they were going to meet in the most solitary\nchamber of the whole solitary pile. Could it be that Paula had well\nconsidered this in replying with her friendly 'Very well?' Probably not.\n\nSomerset proceeded to the chapel and waited. With the progress of the\nseconds towards the half-hour he began to discover that a dangerous\nadmiration for this girl had risen within him. Yet so imaginative was\nhis passion that he hardly knew a single feature of her countenance well\nenough to remember it in her absence. The meditative judgment of things\nand men which had been his habit up to the moment of seeing her in\nthe Baptist chapel seemed to have left him--nothing remained but a\ndistracting wish to be always near her, and it was quite with dismay\nthat he recognized what immense importance he was attaching to the\nquestion whether she would keep the trifling engagement or not.\n\nThe chapel of Stancy Castle was a silent place, heaped up in corners\nwith a lumber of old panels, framework, and broken coloured glass. Here\nno clock could be heard beating out the hours of the day--here no\nvoice of priest or deacon had for generations uttered the daily\nservice denoting how the year rolls on. The stagnation of the spot was\nsufficient to draw Somerset's mind for a moment from the subject which\nabsorbed it, and he thought, 'So, too, will time triumph over all this\nfervour within me.'\n\nLifting his eyes from the floor on which his foot had been tapping\nnervously, he saw Paula standing at the other end. It was not so\npleasant when he also saw that Mrs. Goodman accompanied her. The latter\nlady, however, obligingly remained where she was resting, while Paula\ncame forward, and, as usual, paused without speaking.\n\n'It is in this little arcade that the example occurs,' said Somerset.\n\n'O yes,' she answered, turning to look at it.\n\n'Early piers, capitals, and mouldings, generally alternated with deep\nhollows, so as to form strong shadows. Now look under the abacus of this\ncapital; you will find the stone hollowed out wonderfully; and also in\nthis arch-mould. It is often difficult to understand how it could be\ndone without cracking off the stone. The difference between this and\nlate work can be felt by the hand even better than it can be seen.' He\nsuited the action to the word and placed his hand in the hollow.\n\nShe listened attentively, then stretched up her own hand to test the\ncutting as he had done; she was not quite tall enough; she would step\nupon this piece of wood. Having done so she tried again, and succeeded\nin putting her finger on the spot. No; she could not understand it\nthrough her glove even now. She pulled off her glove, and, her hand\nresting in the stone channel, her eyes became abstracted in the effort\nof realization, the ideas derived through her hand passing into her\nface.\n\n'No, I am not sure now,' she said.\n\nSomerset placed his own hand in the cavity. Now their two hands were\nclose together again. They had been close together half-an-hour earlier,\nand he had sedulously avoided touching hers. He dared not let such an\naccident happen now. And yet--surely she saw the situation! Was the\ninscrutable seriousness with which she applied herself to his lesson\na mockery? There was such a bottomless depth in her eyes that it was\nimpossible to guess truly. Let it be that destiny alone had ruled that\ntheir hands should be together a second time.\n\nAll rumination was cut short by an impulse. He seized her forefinger\nbetween his own finger and thumb, and drew it along the hollow, saying,\n'That is the curve I mean.'\n\nSomerset's hand was hot and trembling; Paula's, on the contrary, was\ncool and soft as an infant's.\n\n'Now the arch-mould,' continued he. 'There--the depth of that cavity is\ntremendous, and it is not geometrical, as in later work.' He drew her\nunresisting fingers from the capital to the arch, and laid them in the\nlittle trench as before.\n\nShe allowed them to rest quietly there till he relinquished them. 'Thank\nyou,' she then said, withdrawing her hand, brushing the dust from her\nfinger-tips, and putting on her glove.\n\nHer imperception of his feeling was the very sublimity of maiden\ninnocence if it were real; if not, well, the coquetry was no great sin.\n\n'Mr. Somerset, will you allow me to have the Greek court I mentioned?'\nshe asked tentatively, after a long break in their discourse, as\nshe scanned the green stones along the base of the arcade, with a\nconjectural countenance as to his reply.\n\n'Will your own feeling for the genius of the place allow you?'\n\n'I am not a mediaevalist: I am an eclectic.'\n\n'You don't dislike your own house on that account.'\n\n'I did at first--I don't so much now.... I should love it, and adore\nevery stone, and think feudalism the only true romance of life, if--'\n\n'What?'\n\n'If I were a De Stancy, and the castle the long home of my forefathers.'\n\nSomerset was a little surprised at the avowal: the minister's words on\nthe effects of her new environment recurred to his mind. 'Miss De Stancy\ndoesn't think so,' he said. 'She cares nothing about those things.'\n\nPaula now turned to him: hitherto her remarks had been sparingly spoken,\nher eyes being directed elsewhere: 'Yes, that is very strange, is it\nnot?' she said. 'But it is owing to the joyous freshness of her nature\nwhich precludes her from dwelling on the past--indeed, the past is\nno more to her than it is to a sparrow or robin. She is scarcely an\ninstance of the wearing out of old families, for a younger mental\nconstitution than hers I never knew.'\n\n'Unless that very simplicity represents the second childhood of her\nline, rather than her own exclusive character.'\n\nPaula shook her head. 'In spite of the Greek court, she is more Greek\nthan I.'\n\n'You represent science rather than art, perhaps.'\n\n'How?' she asked, glancing up under her hat.\n\n'I mean,' replied Somerset, 'that you represent the march of mind--the\nsteamship, and the railway, and the thoughts that shake mankind.'\n\nShe weighed his words, and said: 'Ah, yes: you allude to my father. My\nfather was a great man; but I am more and more forgetting his greatness:\nthat kind of greatness is what a woman can never truly enter into. I am\nless and less his daughter every day that goes by.'\n\nShe walked away a few steps to rejoin the excellent Mrs. Goodman, who,\nas Somerset still perceived, was waiting for Paula at the discreetest\nof distances in the shadows at the farther end of the building. Surely\nPaula's voice had faltered, and she had turned to hide a tear?\n\nShe came back again. 'Did you know that my father made half the railways\nin Europe, including that one over there?' she said, waving her little\ngloved hand in the direction whence low rumbles were occasionally heard\nduring the day.\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'How did you know?'\n\n'Miss De Stancy told me a little; and I then found his name and doings\nwere quite familiar to me.'\n\nCuriously enough, with his words there came through the broken windows\nthe murmur of a train in the distance, sounding clearer and more clear.\nIt was nothing to listen to, yet they both listened; till the increasing\nnoise suddenly broke off into dead silence.\n\n'It has gone into the tunnel,' said Paula. 'Have you seen the tunnel my\nfather made? the curves are said to be a triumph of science. There is\nnothing else like it in this part of England.'\n\n'There is not: I have heard so. But I have not seen it.'\n\n'Do you think it a thing more to be proud of that one's father should\nhave made a great tunnel and railway like that, than that one's remote\nancestor should have built a great castle like this?'\n\nWhat could Somerset say? It would have required a casuist to decide\nwhether his answer should depend upon his conviction, or upon the family\nties of such a questioner. 'From a modern point of view, railways are,\nno doubt, things more to be proud of than castles,' he said; 'though\nperhaps I myself, from mere association, should decide in favour of the\nancestor who built the castle.' The serious anxiety to be truthful that\nSomerset threw into his observation, was more than the circumstance\nrequired. 'To design great engineering works,' he added musingly, and\nwithout the least eye to the disparagement of her parent, 'requires\nno doubt a leading mind. But to execute them, as he did, requires, of\ncourse, only a following mind.'\n\nHis reply had not altogether pleased her; and there was a distinct\nreproach conveyed by her slight movement towards Mrs. Goodman. He saw\nit, and was grieved that he should have spoken so. 'I am going to walk\nover and inspect that famous tunnel of your father's,' he added gently.\n'It will be a pleasant study for this afternoon.'\n\nShe went away. 'I am no man of the world,' he thought. 'I ought to have\npraised that father of hers straight off. I shall not win her respect;\nmuch less her love!'\n\n\n\nXII.\n\nSomerset did not forget what he had planned, and when lunch was over\nhe walked away through the trees. The tunnel was more difficult of\ndiscovery than he had anticipated, and it was only after considerable\nwinding among green lanes, whose deep ruts were like canyons of Colorado\nin miniature, that he reached the slope in the distant upland where the\ntunnel began. A road stretched over its crest, and thence along one side\nof the railway-cutting.\n\nHe there unexpectedly saw standing Miss Power's carriage; and on drawing\nnearer he found it to contain Paula herself, Miss De Stancy, and Mrs.\nGoodman.\n\n'How singular!' exclaimed Miss De Stancy gaily.\n\n'It is most natural,' said Paula instantly. 'In the morning two people\ndiscuss a feature in the landscape, and in the afternoon each has a\ndesire to see it from what the other has said of it. Therefore they\naccidentally meet.'\n\nNow Paula had distinctly heard Somerset declare that he was going to\nwalk there; how then could she say this so coolly? It was with a pang\nat his heart that he returned to his old thought of her being possibly\na finished coquette and dissembler. Whatever she might be, she was not a\ncreature starched very stiffly by Puritanism.\n\nSomerset looked down on the mouth of the tunnel. The popular commonplace\nthat science, steam, and travel must always be unromantic and hideous,\nwas not proven at this spot. On either slope of the deep cutting, green\nwith long grass, grew drooping young trees of ash, beech, and other\nflexible varieties, their foliage almost concealing the actual railway\nwhich ran along the bottom, its thin steel rails gleaming like silver\nthreads in the depths. The vertical front of the tunnel, faced with\nbrick that had once been red, was now weather-stained, lichened, and\nmossed over in harmonious rusty-browns, pearly greys, and neutral\ngreens, at the very base appearing a little blue-black spot like a\nmouse-hole--the tunnel's mouth.\n\nThe carriage was drawn up quite close to the wood railing, and Paula was\nlooking down at the same time with him; but he made no remark to her.\n\nMrs. Goodman broke the silence by saying, 'If it were not a railway we\nshould call it a lovely dell.'\n\nSomerset agreed with her, adding that it was so charming that he felt\ninclined to go down.\n\n'If you do, perhaps Miss Power will order you up again, as a\ntrespasser,' said Charlotte De Stancy. 'You are one of the largest\nshareholders in the railway, are you not, Paula?'\n\nMiss Power did not reply.\n\n'I suppose as the road is partly yours you might walk all the way to\nLondon along the rails, if you wished, might you not, dear?' Charlotte\ncontinued.\n\nPaula smiled, and said, 'No, of course not.'\n\nSomerset, feeling himself superfluous, raised his hat to his companions\nas if he meant not to see them again for a while, and began to descend\nby some steps cut in the earth; Miss De Stancy asked Mrs. Goodman to\naccompany her to a barrow over the top of the tunnel; and they left the\ncarriage, Paula remaining alone.\n\nDown Somerset plunged through the long grass, bushes, late summer\nflowers, moths, and caterpillars, vexed with himself that he had come\nthere, since Paula was so inscrutable, and humming the notes of some\nsong he did not know. The tunnel that had seemed so small from the\nsurface was a vast archway when he reached its mouth, which emitted,\nas a contrast to the sultry heat on the slopes of the cutting, a cool\nbreeze, that had travelled a mile underground from the other end. Far\naway in the darkness of this silent subterranean corridor he could see\nthat other end as a mere speck of light.\n\nWhen he had conscientiously admired the construction of the massive\narchivault, and the majesty of its nude ungarnished walls, he looked up\nthe slope at the carriage; it was so small to the eye that it might\nhave been made for a performance by canaries; Paula's face being still\nsmaller, as she leaned back in her seat, idly looking down at him. There\nseemed something roguish in her attitude of criticism, and to be no\nlonger the subject of her contemplation he entered the tunnel out of her\nsight.\n\nIn the middle of the speck of light before him appeared a speck of\nblack; and then a shrill whistle, dulled by millions of tons of earth,\nreached his ears from thence. It was what he had been on his guard\nagainst all the time,--a passing train; and instead of taking the\ntrouble to come out of the tunnel he stepped into a recess, till the\ntrain had rattled past and vanished onward round a curve.\n\nSomerset still remained where he had placed himself, mentally balancing\nscience against art, the grandeur of this fine piece of construction\nagainst that of the castle, and thinking whether Paula's father had\nnot, after all, the best of it, when all at once he saw Paula's form\nconfronting him at the entrance of the tunnel. He instantly went forward\ninto the light; to his surprise she was as pale as a lily.\n\n'O, Mr. Somerset!' she exclaimed. 'You ought not to frighten me\nso--indeed you ought not! The train came out almost as soon as you had\ngone in, and as you did not return--an accident was possible!'\n\nSomerset at once perceived that he had been to blame in not thinking of\nthis.\n\n'Please do forgive my thoughtlessness in not reflecting how it would\nstrike you!' he pleaded. 'I--I see I have alarmed you.'\n\nHer alarm was, indeed, much greater than he had at first thought: she\ntrembled so much that she was obliged to sit down, at which he went up\nto her full of solicitousness.\n\n'You ought not to have done it!' she said. 'I naturally thought--any\nperson would--'\n\nSomerset, perhaps wisely, said nothing at this outburst; the cause of\nher vexation was, plainly enough, his perception of her discomposure. He\nstood looking in another direction, till in a few moments she had risen\nto her feet again, quite calm.\n\n'It would have been dreadful,' she said with faint gaiety, as the colour\nreturned to her face; 'if I had lost my architect, and been obliged to\nengage Mr. Havill without an alternative.'\n\n'I was really in no danger; but of course I ought to have considered,'\nhe said.\n\n'I forgive you,' she returned good-naturedly. 'I knew there was no\nGREAT danger to a person exercising ordinary discretion; but artists and\nthinkers like you are indiscreet for a moment sometimes. I am now going\nup again. What do you think of the tunnel?'\n\nThey were crossing the railway to ascend by the opposite path, Somerset\nkeeping his eye on the interior of the tunnel for safety, when suddenly\nthere arose a noise and shriek from the contrary direction behind the\ntrees. Both knew in a moment what it meant, and each seized the other as\nthey rushed off the permanent way. The ideas of both had been so centred\non the tunnel as the source of danger, that the probability of a train\nfrom the opposite quarter had been forgotten. It rushed past them,\ncausing Paula's dress, hair, and ribbons to flutter violently, and\nblowing up the fallen leaves in a shower over their shoulders.\n\nNeither spoke, and they went up several steps, holding each other by the\nhand, till, becoming conscious of the fact, she withdrew hers; whereupon\nSomerset stopped and looked earnestly at her; but her eyes were averted\ntowards the tunnel wall.\n\n'What an escape!' he said.\n\n'We were not so very near, I think, were we?' she asked quickly. 'If we\nwere, I think you were--very good to take my hand.'\n\nThey reached the top at last, and the new level and open air seemed to\ngive her a new mind. 'I don't see the carriage anywhere,' she said, in\nthe common tones of civilization.\n\nHe thought it had gone over the crest of the hill; he would accompany\nher till they reached it.\n\n'No--please--I would rather not--I can find it very well.' Before he\ncould say more she had inclined her head and smiled and was on her way\nalone.\n\nThe tunnel-cutting appeared a dreary gulf enough now to the young man,\nas he stood leaning over the rails above it, beating the herbage with\nhis stick. For some minutes he could not criticize or weigh her conduct;\nthe warmth of her presence still encircled him. He recalled her face as\nit had looked out at him from under the white silk puffing of her black\nhat, and the speaking power of her eyes at the moment of danger. The\nbreadth of that clear-complexioned forehead--almost concealed by\nthe masses of brown hair bundled up around it--signified that if her\ndisposition were oblique and insincere enough for trifling, coquetting,\nor in any way making a fool of him, she had the intellect to do it\ncruelly well.\n\nBut it was ungenerous to ruminate so suspiciously. A girl not an actress\nby profession could hardly turn pale artificially as she had done,\nthough perhaps mere fright meant nothing, and would have arisen in her\njust as readily had he been one of the labourers on her estate.\n\nThe reflection that such feeling as she had exhibited could have no\ntender meaning returned upon him with masterful force when he thought of\nher wealth and the social position into which she had drifted. Somerset,\nbeing of a solitary and studious nature, was not quite competent\nto estimate precisely the disqualifying effect, if any, of her\nnonconformity, her newness of blood, and other things, among the old\ncounty families established round her; but the toughest prejudices, he\nthought, were not likely to be long invulnerable to such cheerful beauty\nand brightness of intellect as Paula's. When she emerged, as she was\nplainly about to do, from the seclusion in which she had been living\nsince her father's death, she would inevitably win her way among her\nneighbours. She would become the local topic. Fortune-hunters would\nlearn of her existence and draw near in shoals. What chance would there\nthen be for him?\n\nThe points in his favour were indeed few, but they were just enough\nto keep a tantalizing hope alive. Modestly leaving out of count his\npersonal and intellectual qualifications, he thought of his family. It\nwas an old stock enough, though not a rich one. His great-uncle had\nbeen the well-known Vice-admiral Sir Armstrong Somerset, who served his\ncountry well in the Baltic, the Indies, China, and the Caribbean Sea.\nHis grandfather had been a notable metaphysician. His father, the Royal\nAcademician, was popular. But perhaps this was not the sort of reasoning\nlikely to occupy the mind of a young woman; the personal aspect of the\nsituation was in such circumstances of far more import. He had come as a\nwandering stranger--that possibly lent some interest to him in her eyes.\nHe was installed in an office which would necessitate free communion\nwith her for some time to come; that was another advantage, and would be\na still greater one if she showed, as Paula seemed disposed to do,\nsuch artistic sympathy with his work as to follow up with interest the\ndetails of its progress.\n\nThe carriage did not reappear, and he went on towards Markton,\ndisinclined to return again that day to the studio which had been\nprepared for him at the castle. He heard feet brushing the grass behind\nhim, and, looking round, saw the Baptist minister.\n\n'I have just come from the village,' said Mr. Woodwell, who looked worn\nand weary, his boots being covered with dust; 'and I have learnt that\nwhich confirms my fears for her.'\n\n'For Miss Power?'\n\n'Most assuredly.'\n\n'What danger is there?' said Somerset.\n\n'The temptations of her position have become too much for her! She is\ngoing out of mourning next week, and will give a large dinner-party on\nthe occasion; for though the invitations are partly in the name of\nher relative Mrs. Goodman, they must come from her. The guests are\nto include people of old cavalier families who would have treated her\ngrandfather, sir, and even her father, with scorn for their religion\nand connections; also the parson and curate--yes, actually people who\nbelieve in the Apostolic Succession; and what's more, they're coming.\nMy opinion is, that it has all arisen from her friendship with Miss De\nStancy.'\n\n'Well,' cried Somerset warmly, 'this only shows liberality of feeling on\nboth sides! I suppose she has invited you as well?'\n\n'She has not invited me!... Mr. Somerset, not withstanding your\nerroneous opinions on important matters, I speak to you as a friend, and\nI tell you that she has never in her secret heart forgiven that sermon\nof mine, in which I likened her to the church at Laodicea. I admit\nthe words were harsh, but I was doing my duty, and if the case arose\nto-morrow I would do it again. Her displeasure is a deep grief to me;\nbut I serve One greater than she.... You, of course, are invited to this\ndinner?'\n\n'I have heard nothing of it,' murmured the young man.\n\nTheir paths diverged; and when Somerset reached the hotel he was\ninformed that somebody was waiting to see him.\n\n'Man or woman?' he asked.\n\nThe landlady, who always liked to reply in person to Somerset's\ninquiries, apparently thinking him, by virtue of his drawing implements\nand liberality of payment, a possible lord of Burleigh, came forward and\nsaid it was certainly not a woman, but whether man or boy she could not\nsay. 'His name is Mr. Dare,' she added.\n\n'O--that youth,' he said.\n\nSomerset went upstairs, along the passage, down two steps, round the\nangle, and so on to the rooms reserved for him in this rambling edifice\nof stage-coach memories, where he found Dare waiting. Dare came forward,\npulling out the cutting of an advertisement.\n\n'Mr. Somerset, this is yours, I believe, from the Architectural World?'\n\nSomerset said that he had inserted it.\n\n'I think I should suit your purpose as assistant very well.'\n\n'Are you an architect's draughtsman?'\n\n'Not specially. I have some knowledge of the same, and want to increase\nit.'\n\n'I thought you were a photographer.'\n\n'Also of photography,' said Dare with a bow. 'Though but an amateur in\nthat art I can challenge comparison with Regent Street or Broadway.'\n\nSomerset looked upon his table. Two letters only, addressed in initials,\nwere lying there as answers to his advertisement. He asked Dare to\nwait, and looked them over. Neither was satisfactory. On this account he\novercame his slight feeling against Mr. Dare, and put a question to\ntest that gentleman's capacities. 'How would you measure the front of a\nbuilding, including windows, doors, mouldings, and every other feature,\nfor a ground plan, so as to combine the greatest accuracy with the\ngreatest despatch?'\n\n'In running dimensions,' said Dare.\n\nAs this was the particular kind of work he wanted done, Somerset thought\nthe answer promising. Coming to terms with Dare, he requested the\nwould-be student of architecture to wait at the castle the next day, and\ndismissed him.\n\nA quarter of an hour later, when Dare was taking a walk in the country,\nhe drew from his pocket eight other letters addressed to Somerset in\ninitials, which, to judge by their style and stationery, were from men\nfar superior to those two whose communications alone Somerset had seen.\nDare looked them over for a few seconds as he strolled on, then tore\nthem into minute fragments, and, burying them under the leaves in the\nditch, went on his way again.\n\n\n\nXIII.\n\nThough exhibiting indifference, Somerset had felt a pang of\ndisappointment when he heard the news of Paula's approaching\ndinner-party. It seemed a little unkind of her to pass him over, seeing\nhow much they were thrown together just now. That dinner meant more\nthan it sounded. Notwithstanding the roominess of her castle, she was at\npresent living somewhat incommodiously, owing partly to the stagnation\ncaused by her recent bereavement, and partly to the necessity for\noverhauling the De Stancy lumber piled in those vast and gloomy\nchambers before they could be made tolerable to nineteenth-century\nfastidiousness.\n\nTo give dinners on any large scale before Somerset had at least set\na few of these rooms in order for her, showed, to his thinking, an\noverpowering desire for society.\n\nDuring the week he saw less of her than usual, her time being to\nall appearance much taken up with driving out to make calls on her\nneighbours and receiving return visits. All this he observed from the\nwindows of his studio overlooking the castle ward, in which room he\nnow spent a great deal of his time, bending over drawing-boards and\ninstructing Dare, who worked as well as could be expected of a youth of\nsuch varied attainments.\n\nNearer came the Wednesday of the party, and no hint of that event\nreached Somerset, but such as had been communicated by the Baptist\nminister. At last, on the very afternoon, an invitation was handed into\nhis studio--not a kind note in Paula's handwriting, but a formal printed\ncard in the joint names of Mrs. Goodman and Miss Power. It reached him\njust four hours before the dinner-time. He was plainly to be used as a\nstop-gap at the last moment because somebody could not come.\n\nHaving previously arranged to pass a quiet evening in his rooms at the\nLord Quantock Arms, in reading up chronicles of the castle from\nthe county history, with the view of gathering some ideas as to the\ndistribution of rooms therein before the demolition of a portion of the\nstructure, he decided off-hand that Paula's dinner was not of sufficient\nimportance to him as a professional man and student of art to justify\na waste of the evening by going. He accordingly declined Mrs. Goodman's\nand Miss Power's invitation; and at five o'clock left the castle and\nwalked across the fields to the little town.\n\nHe dined early, and, clearing away heaviness with a cup of coffee,\napplied himself to that volume of the county history which contained the\nrecord of Stancy Castle.\n\nHere he read that 'when this picturesque and ancient structure was\nfounded, or by whom, is extremely uncertain. But that a castle stood on\nthe site in very early times appears from many old books of charters. In\nits prime it was such a masterpiece of fortification as to be the wonder\nof the world, and it was thought, before the invention of gunpowder,\nthat it never could be taken by any force less than divine.'\n\nHe read on to the times when it first passed into the hands of 'De\nStancy, Chivaler,' and received the family name, and so on from De\nStancy to De Stancy till he was lost in the reflection whether Paula\nwould or would not have thought more highly of him if he had accepted\nthe invitation to dinner. Applying himself again to the tome, he learned\nthat in the year 1504 Stephen the carpenter was 'paid eleven pence for\nnecessarye repayrs,' and William the mastermason eight shillings 'for\nwhyt lyming of the kitchen, and the lyme to do it with,' including 'a\nnew rope for the fyer bell;' also the sundry charges for 'vij crockes,\nxiij lytyll pans, a pare of pot hookes, a fyer pane, a lanterne, a\nchafynge dyshe, and xij candyll stychs.'\n\nBang went eight strokes of the clock: it was the dinner-hour.\n\n'There, now I can't go, anyhow!' he said bitterly, jumping up, and\npicturing her receiving her company. How would she look; what would she\nwear? Profoundly indifferent to the early history of the noble\nfabric, he felt a violent reaction towards modernism, eclecticism, new\naristocracies, everything, in short, that Paula represented. He even\ngave himself up to consider the Greek court that she had wished for, and\npassed the remainder of the evening in making a perspective view of the\nsame.\n\nThe next morning he awoke early, and, resolving to be at work betimes,\nstarted promptly. It was a fine calm hour of day; the grass slopes were\nsilvery with excess of dew, and the blue mists hung in the depths of\neach tree for want of wind to blow them out. Somerset entered the\ndrive on foot, and when near the castle he observed in the gravel the\nwheel-marks of the carriages that had conveyed the guests thither the\nnight before. There seemed to have been a large number, for the road\nwhere newly repaired was quite cut up. Before going indoors he was\ntempted to walk round to the wing in which Paula slept.\n\nRooks were cawing, sparrows were chattering there; but the blind of her\nwindow was as closely drawn as if it were midnight. Probably she was\nsound asleep, dreaming of the compliments which had been paid her by\nher guests, and of the future triumphant pleasures that would follow in\ntheir train. Reaching the outer stone stairs leading to the great hall\nhe found them shadowed by an awning brilliantly striped with red\nand blue, within which rows of flowering plants in pots bordered the\npathway. She could not have made more preparation had the gathering been\na ball. He passed along the gallery in which his studio was situated,\nentered the room, and seized a drawing-board to put into correct drawing\nthe sketch for the Greek court that he had struck out the night before,\nthereby abandoning his art principles to please the whim of a girl. Dare\nhad not yet arrived, and after a time Somerset threw down his pencil and\nleant back.\n\nHis eye fell upon something that moved. It was white, and lay in the\nfolding chair on the opposite side of the room. On near approach he\nfound it to be a fragment of swan's-down fanned into motion by his own\nmovements, and partially squeezed into the chink of the chair as though\nby some person sitting on it.\n\nNone but a woman would have worn or brought that swan's-down into his\nstudio, and it made him reflect on the possible one. Nothing interrupted\nhis conjectures till ten o'clock, when Dare came. Then one of the\nservants tapped at the door to know if Mr. Somerset had arrived.\nSomerset asked if Miss Power wished to see him, and was informed that\nshe had only wished to know if he had come. Somerset sent a return\nmessage that he had a design on the board which he should soon be glad\nto submit to her, and the messenger departed.\n\n'Fine doings here last night, sir,' said Dare, as he dusted his\nT-square.\n\n'O indeed!'\n\n'A dinner-party, I hear; eighteen guests.'\n\n'Ah,' said Somerset.\n\n'The young lady was magnificent--sapphires and opals--she carried as\nmuch as a thousand pounds upon her head and shoulders during that three\nor four hour. Of course they call her charming; Compuesta no hay muger\nfea, as they say at Madrid.'\n\n'I don't doubt it for a moment,' said Somerset, with reserve.\n\nDare said no more, and presently the door opened, and there stood Paula.\n\nSomerset nodded to Dare to withdraw into an adjoining room, and offered\nher a chair.\n\n'You wish to show me the design you have prepared?' she asked, without\ntaking the seat.\n\n'Yes; I have come round to your opinion. I have made a plan for\nthe Greek court you were anxious to build.' And he elevated the\ndrawing-board against the wall.\n\nShe regarded it attentively for some moments, her finger resting lightly\nagainst her chin, and said, 'I have given up the idea of a Greek court.'\n\nHe showed his astonishment, and was almost disappointed. He had been\ngrinding up Greek architecture entirely on her account; had wrenched his\nmind round to this strange arrangement, all for nothing.\n\n'Yes,' she continued; 'on reconsideration I perceive the want of harmony\nthat would result from inserting such a piece of marble-work in a\nmediaeval fortress; so in future we will limit ourselves strictly to\nsynchronism of style--that is to say, make good the Norman work by\nNorman, the Perpendicular by Perpendicular, and so on. I have informed\nMr. Havill of the same thing.'\n\nSomerset pulled the Greek drawing off the board, and tore it in two\npieces.\n\nShe involuntarily turned to look in his face, but stopped before she had\nquite lifted her eyes high enough. 'Why did you do that?' she asked with\nsuave curiosity.\n\n'It is of no further use,' said Somerset, tearing the drawing in the\nother direction, and throwing the pieces into the fireplace. 'You have\nbeen reading up orders and styles to some purpose, I perceive.' He\nregarded her with a faint smile.\n\n'I have had a few books down from town. It is desirable to know a little\nabout the architecture of one's own house.'\n\nShe remained looking at the torn drawing, when Somerset, observing on\nthe table the particle of swan's-down he had found in the chair, gently\nblew it so that it skimmed across the table under her eyes.\n\n'It looks as if it came off a lady's dress,' he said idly.\n\n'Off a lady's fan,' she replied.\n\n'O, off a fan?'\n\n'Yes; off mine.'\n\nAt her reply Somerset stretched out his hand for the swan's-down, and\nput it carefully in his pocket-book; whereupon Paula, moulding her\ncherry-red lower lip beneath her upper one in arch self-consciousness at\nhis act, turned away to the window, and after a pause said softly as she\nlooked out, 'Why did you not accept our invitation to dinner?'\n\nIt was impossible to explain why. He impulsively drew near and\nconfronted her, and said, 'I hope you pardon me?'\n\n'I don't know that I can quite do that,' answered she, with ever so\nlittle reproach. 'I know why you did not come--you were mortified at not\nbeing asked sooner! But it was purely by an accident that you received\nyour invitation so late. My aunt sent the others by post, but as\nyours was to be delivered by hand it was left on her table, and was\noverlooked.'\n\nSurely he could not doubt her words; those nice friendly accents were\nthe embodiment of truth itself.\n\n'I don't mean to make a serious complaint,' she added, in injured tones,\nshowing that she did. 'Only we had asked nearly all of them to meet\nyou, as the son of your illustrious father, whom many of my friends know\npersonally; and--they were disappointed.'\n\nIt was now time for Somerset to be genuinely grieved at what he had\ndone. Paula seemed so good and honourable at that moment that he could\nhave laid down his life for her.\n\n'When I was dressed, I came in here to ask you to reconsider your\ndecision,' she continued; 'or to meet us in the drawing-room if you\ncould not possibly be ready for dinner. But you were gone.'\n\n'And you sat down in that chair, didn't you, darling, and remained there\na long time musing!' he thought. But that he did not say.\n\n'I am very sorry,' he murmured.\n\n'Will you make amends by coming to our garden party? I ask you the very\nfirst.'\n\n'I will,' replied Somerset. To add that it would give him great\npleasure, etc., seemed an absurdly weak way of expressing his feelings,\nand he said no more.\n\n'It is on the nineteenth. Don't forget the day.'\n\nHe met her eyes in such a way that, if she were woman, she must have\nseen it to mean as plainly as words: 'Do I look as if I could forget\nanything you say?'\n\nShe must, indeed, have understood much more by this time--the whole of\nhis open secret. But he did not understand her. History has revealed\nthat a supernumerary lover or two is rarely considered a disadvantage by\na woman, from queen to cottage-girl; and the thought made him pause.\n\n\n\nXIV.\n\nWhen she was gone he went on with the drawing, not calling in Dare,\nwho remained in the room adjoining. Presently a servant came and laid a\npaper on his table, which Miss Power had sent. It was one of the morning\nnewspapers, and was folded so that his eye fell immediately on a letter\nheaded 'Restoration or Demolition.'\n\nThe letter was professedly written by a dispassionate person solely in\nthe interests of art. It drew attention to the circumstance that the\nancient and interesting castle of the De Stancys had unhappily passed\ninto the hands of an iconoclast by blood, who, without respect for the\ntradition of the county, or any feeling whatever for history in stone,\nwas about to demolish much, if not all, that was interesting in that\nancient pile, and insert in its midst a monstrous travesty of some\nGreek temple. In the name of all lovers of mediaeval art, conjured the\nsimple-minded writer, let something be done to save a building which,\ninjured and battered in the Civil Wars, was now to be made a complete\nruin by the freaks of an irresponsible owner. Her sending him the paper\nseemed to imply that she required his opinion on the case; and in the\nafternoon, leaving Dare to measure up a wing according to directions, he\nwent out in the hope of meeting her, having learnt that she had gone to\nthe village. On reaching the church he saw her crossing the churchyard\npath with her aunt and Miss De Stancy. Somerset entered the enclosure,\nand as soon as she saw him she came across.\n\n'What is to be done?' she asked.\n\n'You need not be concerned about such a letter as that.'\n\n'I am concerned.'\n\n'I think it dreadful impertinence,' spoke up Charlotte, who had joined\nthem. 'Can you think who wrote it, Mr. Somerset?'\n\nSomerset could not.\n\n'Well, what am I to do?' repeated Paula.\n\n'Just as you would have done before.'\n\n'That's what _I_ say,' observed Mrs. Goodman emphatically.\n\n'But I have already altered--I have given up the Greek court.'\n\n'O--you had seen the paper this morning before you looked at my\ndrawing?'\n\n'I had,' she answered.\n\nSomerset thought it a forcible illustration of her natural reticence\nthat she should have abandoned the design without telling him the\nreason; but he was glad she had not done it from mere caprice.\n\nShe turned to him and said quietly, 'I wish YOU would answer that\nletter.'\n\n'It would be ill-advised,' said Somerset. 'Still, if, after\nconsideration, you wish it much, I will. Meanwhile let me impress upon\nyou again the expediency of calling in Mr. Havill--to whom, as your\nfather's architect, expecting this commission, something perhaps is\nowed--and getting him to furnish an alternative plan to mine, and\nsubmitting the choice of designs to some members of the Royal Institute\nof British Architects. This letter makes it still more advisable than\nbefore.'\n\n'Very well,' said Paula reluctantly.\n\n'Let him have all the particulars you have been good enough to explain\nto me--so that we start fair in the competition.'\n\nShe looked negligently on the grass. 'I will tell the building steward\nto write them out for him,' she said.\n\nThe party separated and entered the church by different doors. Somerset\nwent to a nook of the building that he had often intended to visit. It\nwas called the Stancy aisle; and in it stood the tombs of that family.\nSomerset examined them: they were unusually rich and numerous, beginning\nwith cross-legged knights in hauberks of chain-mail, their ladies beside\nthem in wimple and cover-chief, all more or less coated with the green\nmould and dirt of ages: and continuing with others of later date, in\nfine alabaster, gilded and coloured, some of them wearing round their\nnecks the Yorkist collar of suns and roses, the livery of Edward the\nFourth. In scrutinizing the tallest canopy over these he beheld Paula\nbehind it, as if in contemplation of the same objects.\n\n'You came to the church to sketch these monuments, I suppose, Mr.\nSomerset?' she asked, as soon as she saw him.\n\n'No. I came to speak to you about the letter.'\n\nShe sighed. 'Yes: that letter,' she said. 'I am persecuted! If I had\nbeen one of these it would never have been written.' She tapped the\nalabaster effigy of a recumbent lady with her parasol.\n\n'They are interesting, are they not?' he said. 'She is beautifully\npreserved. The gilding is nearly gone, but beyond that she is perfect.'\n\n'She is like Charlotte,' said Paula. And what was much like another sigh\nescaped her lips.\n\nSomerset admitted that there was a resemblance, while Paula drew her\nforefinger across the marble face of the effigy, and at length took\nout her handkerchief, and began wiping the dust from the hollows of the\nfeatures. He looked on, wondering what her sigh had meant, but guessing\nthat it had been somehow caused by the sight of these sculptures\nin connection with the newspaper writer's denunciation of her as an\nirresponsible outsider.\n\nThe secret was out when in answer to his question, idly put, if she\nwished she were like one of these, she said, with exceptional vehemence\nfor one of her demeanour--\n\n'I don't wish I was like one of them: I wish I WAS one of them.'\n\n'What--you wish you were a De Stancy?'\n\n'Yes. It is very dreadful to be denounced as a barbarian. I want to be\nromantic and historical.'\n\n'Miss De Stancy seems not to value the privilege,' he said, looking\nround at another part of the church where Charlotte was innocently\nprattling to Mrs. Goodman, quite heedless of the tombs of her\nforefathers.\n\n'If I were one,' she continued, 'I should come here when I feel alone in\nthe world, as I do to-day; and I would defy people, and say, \"You cannot\nspoil what has been!\"'\n\nThey walked on till they reached the old black pew attached to the\ncastle--a vast square enclosure of oak panelling occupying half the\naisle, and surmounted with a little balustrade above the framework.\nWithin, the baize lining that had once been green, now faded to the\ncolour of a common in August, was torn, kicked and scraped to rags by\nthe feet and hands of the ploughboys who had appropriated the pew as\ntheir own special place of worship since it had ceased to be used by any\nresident at the castle, because its height afforded convenient shelter\nfor playing at marbles and pricking with pins.\n\nCharlotte and Mrs. Goodman had by this time left the building, and could\nbe seen looking at the headstones outside.\n\n'If you were a De Stancy,' said Somerset, who had pondered more deeply\nupon that new wish of hers than he had seemed to do, 'you would be a\nchurchwoman, and sit here.'\n\n'And I should have the pew done up,' she said readily, as she rested\nher pretty chin on the top rail and looked at the interior, her cheeks\npressed into deep dimples. Her quick reply told him that the idea was no\nnew one with her, and he thought of poor Mr. Woodwell's shrewd prophecy\nas he perceived that her days as a separatist were numbered.\n\n'Well, why can't you have it done up, and sit here?' he said warily.\n\nPaula shook her head.\n\n'You are not at enmity with Anglicanism, I am sure?'\n\n'I want not to be. I want to be--what--'\n\n'What the De Stancys were, and are,' he said insidiously; and her\nsilenced bearing told him that he had hit the nail.\n\nIt was a strange idea to get possession of such a nature as hers, and\nfor a minute he felt himself on the side of the minister. So strong was\nSomerset's feeling of wishing her to show the quality of fidelity to\npaternal dogma and party, that he could not help adding--\n\n'But have you forgotten that other nobility--the nobility of talent and\nenterprise?'\n\n'No. But I wish I had a well-known line of ancestors.'\n\n'You have. Archimedes, Newcomen, Watt, Telford, Stephenson, those\nare your father's direct ancestors. Have you forgotten them? Have you\nforgotten your father, and the railways he made over half Europe, and\nhis great energy and skill, and all connected with him as if he had\nnever lived?'\n\nShe did not answer for some time. 'No, I have not forgotten it,' she\nsaid, still looking into the pew. 'But, I have a predilection d'artiste\nfor ancestors of the other sort, like the De Stancys.'\n\nHer hand was resting on the low pew next the high one of the De Stancys.\nSomerset looked at the hand, or rather at the glove which covered it,\nthen at her averted cheek, then beyond it into the pew, then at her hand\nagain, until by an indescribable consciousness that he was not going too\nfar he laid his own upon it.\n\n'No, no,' said Paula quickly, withdrawing her hand. But there was\nnothing resentful or haughty in her tone--nothing, in short, which makes\na man in such circumstances feel that he has done a particularly foolish\naction.\n\nThe flower on her bosom rose and fell somewhat more than usual as she\nadded, 'I am going away now--I will leave you here.' Without waiting for\na reply she adroitly swept back her skirts to free her feet and went out\nof the church blushing.\n\nSomerset took her hint and did not follow; and when he knew that she had\nrejoined her friends, and heard the carriage roll away, he made towards\nthe opposite door. Pausing to glance once more at the alabaster effigies\nbefore leaving them to their silence and neglect, he beheld Dare bending\nover them, to all appearance intently occupied.\n\nHe must have been in the church some time--certainly during the tender\nepisode between Somerset and Paula, and could not have failed to\nperceive it. Somerset blushed: it was unpleasant that Dare should have\nseen the interior of his heart so plainly. He went across and said, 'I\nthink I left you to finish the drawing of the north wing, Mr. Dare?'\n\n'Three hours ago, sir,' said Dare. 'Having finished that, I came to look\nat the church--fine building--fine monuments--two interesting people\nlooking at them.'\n\n'What?'\n\n'I stand corrected. Pensa molto, parla poco, as the Italians have it.'\n\n'Well, now, Mr. Dare, suppose you get back to the castle?'\n\n'Which history dubs Castle Stancy.... Certainly.'\n\n'How do you get on with the measuring?'\n\nDare sighed whimsically. 'Badly in the morning, when I have been tempted\nto indulge overnight, and worse in the afternoon, when I have been\ntempted in the morning!'\n\nSomerset looked at the youth, and said, 'I fear I shall have to dispense\nwith your services, Dare, for I think you have been tempted to-day.'\n\n'On my honour no. My manner is a little against me, Mr. Somerset. But\nyou need not fear for my ability to do your work. I am a young man\nwasted, and am thought of slight account: it is the true men who get\nsnubbed, while traitors are allowed to thrive!'\n\n'Hang sentiment, Dare, and off with you!' A little ruffled, Somerset had\nturned his back upon the interesting speaker, so that he did not observe\nthe sly twist Dare threw into his right eye as he spoke. The latter went\noff in one direction and Somerset in the other, pursuing his pensive way\ntowards Markton with thoughts not difficult to divine.\n\nFrom one point in her nature he went to another, till he again recurred\nto her romantic interest in the De Stancy family. To wish she was one\nof them: how very inconsistent of her. That she really did wish it was\nunquestionable.\n\n\n\nXV.\n\nIt was the day of the garden-party. The weather was too cloudy to be\ncalled perfect, but it was as sultry as the most thinly-clad young lady\ncould desire. Great trouble had been taken by Paula to bring the lawn\nto a fit condition after the neglect of recent years, and Somerset had\nsuggested the design for the tents. As he approached the precincts of\nthe castle he discerned a flag of newest fabric floating over the keep,\nand soon his fly fell in with the stream of carriages that were passing\nover the bridge into the outer ward.\n\nMrs. Goodman and Paula were receiving the people in the drawing-room.\nSomerset came forward in his turn; but as he was immediately followed by\nothers there was not much opportunity, even had she felt the wish, for\nany special mark of feeling in the younger lady's greeting of him.\n\nHe went on through a canvas passage, lined on each side with flowering\nplants, till he reached the tents; thence, after nodding to one or two\nguests slightly known to him, he proceeded to the grounds, with a sense\nof being rather lonely. Few visitors had as yet got so far in, and as\nhe walked up and down a shady alley his mind dwelt upon the new\naspect under which Paula had greeted his eyes that afternoon. Her\nblack-and-white costume had finally disappeared, and in its place she\nhad adopted a picturesque dress of ivory white, with satin enrichments\nof the same hue; while upon her bosom she wore a blue flower. Her days\nof infestivity were plainly ended, and her days of gladness were to\nbegin.\n\nHis reverie was interrupted by the sound of his name, and looking round\nhe beheld Havill, who appeared to be as much alone as himself.\n\nSomerset already knew that Havill had been appointed to compete with\nhim, according to his recommendation. In measuring a dark corner a day\nor two before, he had stumbled upon Havill engaged in the same pursuit\nwith a view to the rival design. Afterwards he had seen him receiving\nPaula's instructions precisely as he had done himself. It was as he had\nwished, for fairness' sake: and yet he felt a regret, for he was less\nPaula's own architect now.\n\n'Well, Mr. Somerset,' said Havill, 'since we first met an unexpected\nrivalry has arisen between us! But I dare say we shall survive the\ncontest, as it is not one arising out of love. Ha-ha-ha!' He spoke in a\nlevel voice of fierce pleasantry, and uncovered his regular white teeth.\n\nSomerset supposed him to allude to the castle competition?\n\n'Yes,' said Havill. 'Her proposed undertaking brought out some adverse\ncriticism till it was known that she intended to have more than one\narchitectural opinion. An excellent stroke of hers to disarm criticism.\nYou saw the second letter in the morning papers?'\n\n'No,' said the other.\n\n'The writer states that he has discovered that the competent advice of\ntwo architects is to be taken, and withdraws his accusations.'\n\nSomerset said nothing for a minute. 'Have you been supplied with the\nnecessary data for your drawings?' he asked, showing by the question the\ntrack his thoughts had taken.\n\nHavill said that he had. 'But possibly not so completely as you have,'\nhe added, again smiling fiercely. Somerset did not quite like the\ninsinuation, and the two speakers parted, the younger going towards the\nmusicians, who had now begun to fill the air with their strains from the\nembowered enclosure of a drooping ash. When he got back to the marquees\nthey were quite crowded, and the guests began to pour out upon the\ngrass, the toilets of the ladies presenting a brilliant spectacle--here\nbeing coloured dresses with white devices, there white dresses with\ncoloured devices, and yonder transparent dresses with no device at all.\nA lavender haze hung in the air, the trees were as still as those of a\nsubmarine forest; while the sun, in colour like a brass plaque, had a\nhairy outline in the livid sky.\n\nAfter watching awhile some young people who were so madly devoted to\nlawn-tennis that they set about it like day-labourers at the moment\nof their arrival, he turned and saw approaching a graceful figure in\ncream-coloured hues, whose gloves lost themselves beneath her lace\nruffles, even when she lifted her hand to make firm the blue flower at\nher breast, and whose hair hung under her hat in great knots so well\ncompacted that the sun gilded the convexity of each knot like a ball.\n\n'You seem to be alone,' said Paula, who had at last escaped from the\nduty of receiving guests.\n\n'I don't know many people.'\n\n'Yes: I thought of that while I was in the drawing-room. But I could not\nget out before. I am now no longer a responsible being: Mrs. Goodman\nis mistress for the remainder of the day. Will you be introduced to\nanybody? Whom would you like to know?'\n\n'I am not particularly unhappy in my solitude.'\n\n'But you must be made to know a few.'\n\n'Very well--I submit readily.'\n\nShe looked away from him, and while he was observing upon her cheek the\nmoving shadow of leaves cast by the declining sun, she said, 'O, there\nis my aunt,' and beckoned with her parasol to that lady, who approached\nin the comparatively youthful guise of a grey silk dress that whistled\nat every touch.\n\nPaula left them together, and Mrs. Goodman then made him acquainted with\na few of the best people, describing what they were in a whisper before\nthey came up, among them being the Radical member for Markton, who had\nsucceeded to the seat rendered vacant by the death of Paula's father.\nWhile talking to this gentleman on the proposed enlargement of the\ncastle, Somerset raised his eyes and hand towards the walls, the better\nto point out his meaning; in so doing he saw a face in the square of\ndarkness formed by one of the open windows, the effect being that of a\nhighlight portrait by Vandyck or Rembrandt.\n\nIt was his assistant Dare, leaning on the window-sill of the studio, as\nhe smoked his cigarette and surveyed the gay groups promenading beneath.\n\nAfter holding a chattering conversation with some ladies from a\nneighbouring country seat who had known his father in bygone years, and\nhanding them ices and strawberries till they were satisfied, he found an\nopportunity of leaving the grounds, wishing to learn what progress Dare\nhad made in the survey of the castle.\n\nDare was still in the studio when he entered. Somerset informed the\nyouth that there was no necessity for his working later that day, unless\nto please himself, and proceeded to inspect Dare's achievements thus\nfar. To his vexation Dare had not plotted three dimensions during the\nprevious two days. This was not the first time that Dare, either from\nincompetence or indolence, had shown his inutility as a house-surveyor\nand draughtsman.\n\n'Mr. Dare,' said Somerset, 'I fear you don't suit me well enough to make\nit necessary that you should stay after this week.'\n\nDare removed the cigarette from his lips and bowed. 'If I don't suit,\nthe sooner I go the better; why wait the week?' he said.\n\n'Well, that's as you like.'\n\nSomerset drew the inkstand towards him, wrote out a cheque for Dare's\nservices, and handed it across the table.\n\n'I'll not trouble you to-morrow,' said Dare, seeing that the payment\nincluded the week in advance.\n\n'Very well,' replied Somerset. 'Please lock the door when you leave.'\nShaking hands with Dare and wishing him well, he left the room and\ndescended to the lawn below.\n\nThere he contrived to get near Miss Power again, and inquired of her for\nMiss De Stancy.\n\n'O! did you not know?' said Paula; 'her father is unwell, and she\npreferred staying with him this afternoon.'\n\n'I hoped he might have been here.'\n\n'O no; he never comes out of his house to any party of this sort; it\nexcites him, and he must not be excited.'\n\n'Poor Sir William!' muttered Somerset.\n\n'No,' said Paula, 'he is grand and historical.'\n\n'That is hardly an orthodox notion for a Puritan,' said Somerset\nmischievously.\n\n'I am not a Puritan,' insisted Paula.\n\nThe day turned to dusk, and the guests began going in relays to the\ndining-hall. When Somerset had taken in two or three ladies to whom\nhe had been presented, and attended to their wants, which occupied him\nthree-quarters of an hour, he returned again to the large tent, with\na view to finding Paula and taking his leave. It was now brilliantly\nlighted up, and the musicians, who during daylight had been invisible\nbehind the ash-tree, were ensconced at one end with their harps and\nviolins. It reminded him that there was to be dancing. The tent had in\nthe meantime half filled with a new set of young people who had come\nexpressly for that pastime. Behind the girls gathered numbers of newly\narrived young men with low shoulders and diminutive moustaches, who were\nevidently prepared for once to sacrifice themselves as partners.\n\nSomerset felt something of a thrill at the sight. He was an infrequent\ndancer, and particularly unprepared for dancing at present; but to dance\nonce with Paula Power he would give a year of his life. He looked round;\nbut she was nowhere to be seen. The first set began; old and middle-aged\npeople gathered from the different rooms to look on at the gyrations of\ntheir children, but Paula did not appear. When another dance or two had\nprogressed, and an increase in the average age of the dancers was making\nitself perceptible, especially on the masculine side, Somerset was\naroused by a whisper at his elbow--\n\n'You dance, I think? Miss Deverell is disengaged. She has not been asked\nonce this evening.' The speaker was Paula.\n\nSomerset looked at Miss Deverell--a sallow lady with black twinkling\neyes, yellow costume, and gay laugh, who had been there all the\nafternoon--and said something about having thought of going home.\n\n'Is that because I asked you to dance?' she murmured. 'There--she is\nappropriated.' A young gentleman had at that moment approached the\nuninviting Miss Deverell, claimed her hand and led her off.\n\n'That's right,' said Somerset. 'I ought to leave room for younger men.'\n\n'You need not say so. That bald-headed gentleman is forty-five. He does\nnot think of younger men.'\n\n'Have YOU a dance to spare for me?'\n\nHer face grew stealthily redder in the candle-light. 'O!--I have no\nengagement at all--I have refused. I hardly feel at liberty to dance; it\nwould be as well to leave that to my visitors.'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'My father, though he allowed me to be taught, never liked the idea of\nmy dancing.'\n\n'Did he make you promise anything on the point?'\n\n'He said he was not in favour of such amusements--no more.'\n\n'I think you are not bound by that, on an informal occasion like the\npresent.'\n\nShe was silent.\n\n'You will just once?' said he.\n\nAnother silence. 'If you like,' she venturesomely answered at last.\n\nSomerset closed the hand which was hanging by his side, and somehow hers\nwas in it. The dance was nearly formed, and he led her forward. Several\npersons looked at them significantly, but he did not notice it then, and\nplunged into the maze.\n\nNever had Mr. Somerset passed through such an experience before. Had he\nnot felt her actual weight and warmth, he might have fancied the whole\nepisode a figment of the imagination. It seemed as if those musicians\nhad thrown a double sweetness into their notes on seeing the mistress of\nthe castle in the dance, that a perfumed southern atmosphere had begun\nto pervade the marquee, and that human beings were shaking themselves\nfree of all inconvenient gravitation.\n\nSomerset's feelings burst from his lips. 'This is the happiest moment I\nhave ever known,' he said. 'Do you know why?'\n\n'I think I saw a flash of lightning through the opening of the tent,'\nsaid Paula, with roguish abruptness.\n\nHe did not press for an answer. Within a few minutes a long growl of\nthunder was heard. It was as if Jove could not refrain from\ntestifying his jealousy of Somerset for taking this covetable woman so\npresumptuously in his arms.\n\nThe dance was over, and he had retired with Paula to the back of the\ntent, when another faint flash of lightning was visible through an\nopening. She lifted the canvas, and looked out, Somerset looking out\nbehind her. Another dance was begun, and being on this account left out\nof notice, Somerset did not hasten to leave Paula's side.\n\n'I think they begin to feel the heat,' she said.\n\n'A little ventilation would do no harm.' He flung back the tent door\nwhere he stood, and the light shone out upon the grass.\n\n'I must go to the drawing-room soon,' she added. 'They will begin to\nleave shortly.'\n\n'It is not late. The thunder-cloud has made it seem dark--see there;\na line of pale yellow stretches along the horizon from west to north.\nThat's evening--not gone yet. Shall we go into the fresh air for a\nminute?'\n\nShe seemed to signify assent, and he stepped off the tent-floor upon the\nground. She stepped off also.\n\nThe air out-of-doors had not cooled, and without definitely choosing a\ndirection they found themselves approaching a little wooden tea-house\nthat stood on the lawn a few yards off. Arrived here, they turned, and\nregarded the tent they had just left, and listened to the strains that\ncame from within it.\n\n'I feel more at ease now,' said Paula.\n\n'So do I,' said Somerset.\n\n'I mean,' she added in an undeceiving tone, 'because I saw Mrs. Goodman\nenter the tent again just as we came out here; so I have no further\nresponsibility.'\n\n'I meant something quite different. Try to guess what.'\n\nShe teasingly demurred, finally breaking the silence by saying, 'The\nrain is come at last,' as great drops began to fall upon the ground with\na smack, like pellets of clay.\n\nIn a moment the storm poured down with sudden violence, and they drew\nfurther back into the summer-house. The side of the tent from which they\nhad emerged still remained open, the rain streaming down between their\neyes and the lighted interior of the marquee like a tissue of glass\nthreads, the brilliant forms of the dancers passing and repassing behind\nthe watery screen, as if they were people in an enchanted submarine\npalace.\n\n'How happy they are!' said Paula. 'They don't even know that it is\nraining. I am so glad that my aunt had the tent lined; otherwise such a\ndownpour would have gone clean through it.'\n\nThe thunder-storm showed no symptoms of abatement, and the music and\ndancing went on more merrily than ever.\n\n'We cannot go in,' said Somerset. 'And we cannot shout for umbrellas. We\nwill stay till it is over, will we not?'\n\n'Yes,' she said, 'if you care to. Ah!'\n\n'What is it?'\n\n'Only a big drop came upon my head.'\n\n'Let us stand further in.'\n\nHer hand was hanging by her side, and Somerset's was close by. He took\nit, and she did not draw it away. Thus they stood a long while, the rain\nhissing down upon the grass-plot, and not a soul being visible outside\nthe dancing-tent save themselves.\n\n'May I call you Paula?' asked he.\n\nThere was no answer.\n\n'May I?' he repeated.\n\n'Yes, occasionally,' she murmured.\n\n'Dear Paula!--may I call you that?'\n\n'O no--not yet.'\n\n'But you know I love you?'\n\n'Yes,' she whispered.\n\n'And shall I love you always?'\n\n'If you wish to.'\n\n'And will you love me?'\n\nPaula did not reply.\n\n'Will you, Paula?' he repeated.\n\n'You may love me.'\n\n'But don't you love me in return?'\n\n'I love you to love me.'\n\n'Won't you say anything more explicit?'\n\n'I would rather not.'\n\nSomerset emitted half a sigh: he wished she had been more demonstrative,\nyet felt that this passive way of assenting was as much as he could hope\nfor. Had there been anything cold in her passivity he might have\nfelt repressed; but her stillness suggested the stillness of motion\nimperceptible from its intensity.\n\n'We must go in,' said she. 'The rain is almost over, and there is no\nlonger any excuse for this.'\n\nSomerset bent his lips toward hers. 'No,' said the fair Puritan\ndecisively.\n\n'Why not?' he asked.\n\n'Nobody ever has.'\n\n'But!--' expostulated Somerset.\n\n'To everything there is a season, and the season for this is not just\nnow,' she answered, walking away.\n\nThey crossed the wet and glistening lawn, stepped under the tent and\nparted. She vanished, he did not know whither; and, standing with his\ngaze fixed on the dancers, the young man waited, till, being in no mood\nto join them, he went slowly through the artificial passage lined with\nflowers, and entered the drawing room. Mrs. Goodman was there, bidding\ngood-night to the early goers, and Paula was just behind her, apparently\nin her usual mood. His parting with her was quite formal, but that he\ndid not mind, for her colour rose decidedly higher as he approached, and\nthe light in her eyes was like the ray of a diamond.\n\nWhen he reached the door he found that his brougham from the Quantock\nArms, which had been waiting more than an hour, could not be heard of.\nThat vagrancy of spirit which love induces would not permit him to wait;\nand, leaving word that the man was to follow him when he returned, he\nwent past the glare of carriage-lamps ranked in the ward, and under the\nouter arch. The night was now clear and beautiful, and he strolled along\nhis way full of mysterious elation till the vehicle overtook him, and he\ngot in.\n\nUp to this point Somerset's progress in his suit had been, though\nincomplete, so uninterrupted, that he almost feared the good chance he\nenjoyed. How should it be in a mortal of his calibre to command success\nwith such a sweet woman for long? He might, indeed, turn out to be\none of the singular exceptions which are said to prove rules; but when\nfortune means to men most good, observes the bard, she looks upon them\nwith a threatening eye. Somerset would even have been content that a\nlittle disapproval of his course should have occurred in some quarter,\nso as to make his wooing more like ordinary life. But Paula was not\nclearly won, and that was drawback sufficient. In these pleasing agonies\nand painful delights he passed the journey to Markton.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THE SECOND. DARE AND HAVILL.\n\n\nI.\n\nYoung Dare sat thoughtfully at the window of the studio in which\nSomerset had left him, till the gay scene beneath became embrowned by\nthe twilight, and the brilliant red stripes of the marquees, the\nbright sunshades, the many-tinted costumes of the ladies, were\nindistinguishable from the blacks and greys of the masculine contingent\nmoving among them. He had occasionally glanced away from the outward\nprospect to study a small old volume that lay before him on the\ndrawing-board. Near scrutiny revealed the book to bear the title\n'Moivre's Doctrine of Chances.'\n\nThe evening had been so still that Dare had heard conversations from\nbelow with a clearness unsuspected by the speakers themselves; and among\nthe dialogues which thus reached his ears was that between Somerset and\nHavill on their professional rivalry. When they parted, and Somerset had\nmingled with the throng, Havill went to a seat at a distance. Afterwards\nhe rose, and walked away; but on the bench he had quitted there remained\na small object resembling a book or leather case.\n\nDare put away the drawing-board and plotting-scales which he had kept\nbefore him during the evening as a reason for his presence at that post\nof espial, locked up the door, and went downstairs. Notwithstanding his\ndismissal by Somerset, he was so serene in countenance and easy in gait\nas to make it a fair conjecture that professional servitude, however\nprofitable, was no necessity with him. The gloom now rendered it\npracticable for any unbidden guest to join Paula's assemblage without\ncriticism, and Dare walked boldly out upon the lawn. The crowd on the\ngrass was rapidly diminishing; the tennis-players had relinquished\nsport; many people had gone in to dinner or supper; and many others,\nattracted by the cheerful radiance of the candles, were gathering in the\nlarge tent that had been lighted up for dancing.\n\nDare went to the garden-chair on which Havill had been seated, and found\nthe article left behind to be a pocket-book. Whether because it was\nunclasped and fell open in his hand, or otherwise, he did not hesitate\nto examine the contents. Among a mass of architect's customary memoranda\noccurred a draft of the letter abusing Paula as an iconoclast or\nVandal by blood, which had appeared in the newspaper: the draft was\nso interlined and altered as to bear evidence of being the original\nconception of that ungentlemanly attack.\n\nThe lad read the letter, smiled, and strolled about the grounds,\nonly met by an occasional pair of individuals of opposite sex in deep\nconversation, the state of whose emotions led them to prefer the evening\nshade to the publicity and glare of the tents and rooms. At last he\nobserved the white waistcoat of the man he sought.\n\n'Mr. Havill, the architect, I believe?' said Dare. 'The author of most\nof the noteworthy buildings in this neighbourhood?'\n\nHavill assented blandly.\n\n'I have long wished for the pleasure of your acquaintance, and now an\naccident helps me to make it. This pocket-book, I think, is yours?'\n\nHavill clapped his hand to his pocket, examined the book Dare held out\nto him, and took it with thanks. 'I see I am speaking to the artist,\narchaeologist, Gothic photographer--Mr. Dare.'\n\n'Professor Dare.'\n\n'Professor? Pardon me, I should not have guessed it--so young as you\nare.'\n\n'Well, it is merely ornamental; and in truth, I drop the title in\nEngland, particularly under present circumstances.'\n\n'Ah--they are peculiar, perhaps? Ah, I remember. I have heard that you\nare assisting a gentleman in preparing a design in opposition to mine--a\ndesign--'\n\n'\"That he is not competent to prepare himself,\" you were perhaps going\nto add?'\n\n'Not precisely that.'\n\n'You could hardly be blamed for such words. However, you are mistaken.\nI did assist him to gain a little further insight into the working of\narchitectural plans; but our views on art are antagonistic, and I assist\nhim no more. Mr. Havill, it must be very provoking to a well-established\nprofessional man to have a rival sprung at him in a grand undertaking\nwhich he had a right to expect as his own.'\n\nProfessional sympathy is often accepted from those whose condolence on\nany domestic matter would be considered intrusive. Havill walked up and\ndown beside Dare for a few moments in silence, and at last showed that\nthe words had told, by saying: 'Every one may have his opinion. Had I\nbeen a stranger to the Power family, the case would have been different;\nbut having been specially elected by the lady's father as a competent\nadviser in such matters, and then to be degraded to the position of a\nmere competitor, it wounds me to the quick--'\n\n'Both in purse and in person, like the ill-used hostess of the Garter.'\n\n'A lady to whom I have been a staunch friend,' continued Havill, not\nheeding the interruption.\n\nAt that moment sounds seemed to come from Dare which bore a remarkable\nresemblance to the words, 'Ho, ho, Havill!' It was hardly credible,\nand yet, could he be mistaken? Havill turned. Dare's eye was twisted\ncomically upward.\n\n'What does that mean?' said Havill coldly, and with some amazement.\n\n'Ho, ho, Havill! \"Staunch friend\" is good--especially after \"an\niconoclast and Vandal by blood\"--\"monstrosity in the form of a Greek\ntemple,\" and so on, eh!'\n\n'Sir, you have the advantage of me. Perhaps you allude to that anonymous\nletter?'\n\n'O-ho, Havill!' repeated the boy-man, turning his eyes yet further\ntowards the zenith. 'To an outsider such conduct would be natural;\nbut to a friend who finds your pocket-book, and looks into it before\nreturning it, and kindly removes a leaf bearing the draft of a letter\nwhich might injure you if discovered there, and carefully conceals it\nin his own pocket--why, such conduct is unkind!' Dare held up the\nabstracted leaf.\n\nHavill trembled. 'I can explain,' he began.\n\n'It is not necessary: we are friends,' said Dare assuringly.\n\nHavill looked as if he would like to snatch the leaf away, but altering\nhis mind, he said grimly: 'Well, I take you at your word: we are\nfriends. That letter was concocted before I knew of the competition:\nit was during my first disgust, when I believed myself entirely\nsupplanted.'\n\n'I am not in the least surprised. But if she knew YOU to be the writer!'\n\n'I should be ruined as far as this competition is concerned,' said\nHavill carelessly. 'Had I known I was to be invited to compete, I should\nnot have written it, of course. To be supplanted is hard; and thereby\nhangs a tale.'\n\n'Another tale? You astonish me.'\n\n'Then you have not heard the scandal, though everybody is talking about\nit.'\n\n'A scandal implies indecorum.'\n\n'Well, 'tis indecorous. Her infatuated partiality for him is patent to\nthe eyes of a child; a man she has only known a few weeks, and one who\nobtained admission to her house in the most irregular manner! Had she a\nwatchful friend beside her, instead of that moonstruck Mrs. Goodman, she\nwould be cautioned against bestowing her favours on the first adventurer\nwho appears at her door. It is a pity, a great pity!'\n\n'O, there is love-making in the wind?' said Dare slowly. 'That alters\nthe case for me. But it is not proved?'\n\n'It can easily be proved.'\n\n'I wish it were, or disproved.'\n\n'You have only to come this way to clear up all doubts.'\n\nHavill took the lad towards the tent, from which the strains of a waltz\nnow proceeded, and on whose sides flitting shadows told of the progress\nof the dance. The companions looked in. The rosy silk lining of the\nmarquee, and the numerous coronas of wax lights, formed a canopy to a\nradiant scene which, for two at least of those who composed it, was an\nintoxicating one. Paula and Somerset were dancing together.\n\n'That proves nothing,' said Dare.\n\n'Look at their rapt faces, and say if it does not,' sneered Havill.\n\nDare objected to a judgment based on looks alone.\n\n'Very well--time will show,' said the architect, dropping the\ntent-curtain.... 'Good God! a girl worth fifty thousand and more a year\nto throw herself away upon a fellow like that--she ought to be whipped.'\n\n'Time must NOT show!' said Dare.\n\n'You speak with emphasis.'\n\n'I have reason. I would give something to be sure on this point, one way\nor the other. Let us wait till the dance is over, and observe them more\ncarefully. Horensagen ist halb gelogen! Hearsay is half lies.'\n\nSheet-lightnings increased in the northern sky, followed by thunder like\nthe indistinct noise of a battle. Havill and Dare retired to the trees.\nWhen the dance ended Somerset and his partner emerged from the tent,\nand slowly moved towards the tea-house. Divining their goal Dare seized\nHavill's arm; and the two worthies entered the building unseen, by first\npassing round behind it. They seated themselves in the back part of the\ninterior, where darkness prevailed.\n\nAs before related, Paula and Somerset came and stood within the door.\nWhen the rain increased they drew themselves further inward, their forms\nbeing distinctly outlined to the gaze of those lurking behind by the\nlight from the tent beyond. But the hiss of the falling rain and the\nlowness of their tones prevented their words from being heard.\n\n'I wish myself out of this!' breathed Havill to Dare, as he buttoned his\ncoat over his white waistcoat. 'I told you it was true, but you wouldn't\nbelieve. I wouldn't she should catch me here eavesdropping for the\nworld!'\n\n'Courage, Man Friday,' said his cooler comrade.\n\nPaula and her lover backed yet further, till the hem of her skirt\ntouched Havill's feet. Their attitudes were sufficient to prove their\nrelations to the most obstinate Didymus who should have witnessed them.\nTender emotions seemed to pervade the summer-house like an aroma. The\ncalm ecstasy of the condition of at least one of them was not without\na coercive effect upon the two invidious spectators, so that they must\nneed have remained passive had they come there to disturb or annoy. The\nserenity of Paula was even more impressive than the hushed ardour of\nSomerset: she did not satisfy curiosity as Somerset satisfied it; she\npiqued it. Poor Somerset had reached a perfectly intelligible depth--one\nwhich had a single blissful way out of it, and nine calamitous ones; but\nPaula remained an enigma all through the scene.\n\nThe rain ceased, and the pair moved away. The enchantment worked by\ntheir presence vanished, the details of the meeting settled down in\nthe watchers' minds, and their tongues were loosened. Dare, turning to\nHavill, said, 'Thank you; you have done me a timely turn to-day.'\n\n'What! had you hopes that way?' asked Havill satirically.\n\n'I! The woman that interests my heart has yet to be born,' said Dare,\nwith a steely coldness strange in such a juvenile, and yet almost\nconvincing. 'But though I have not personal hopes, I have an objection\nto this courtship. Now I think we may as well fraternize, the situation\nbeing what it is?'\n\n'What is the situation?'\n\n'He is in your way as her architect; he is in my way as her lover: we\ndon't want to hurt him, but we wish him clean out of the neighbourhood.'\n\n'I'll go as far as that,' said Havill.\n\n'I have come here at some trouble to myself, merely to observe: I find I\nought to stay to act.'\n\n'If you were myself, a married man with people dependent on him, who has\nhad a professional certainty turned to a miserably remote contingency\nby these events, you might say you ought to act; but what conceivable\ndifference it can make to you who it is the young lady takes to her\nheart and home, I fail to understand.'\n\n'Well, I'll tell you--this much at least. I want to keep the place\nvacant for another man.'\n\n'The place?'\n\n'The place of husband to Miss Power, and proprietor of that castle and\ndomain.'\n\n'That's a scheme with a vengeance. Who is the man?'\n\n'It is my secret at present.'\n\n'Certainly.' Havill drew a deep breath, and dropped into a tone of\ndepression. 'Well, scheme as you will, there will be small advantage to\nme,' he murmured. 'The castle commission is as good as gone, and a bill\nfor two hundred pounds falls due next week.'\n\n'Cheer up, heart! My position, if you only knew it, has ten times\nthe difficulties of yours, since this disagreeable discovery. Let us\nconsider if we can assist each other. The competition drawings are to be\nsent in--when?'\n\n'In something over six weeks--a fortnight before she returns from the\nScilly Isles, for which place she leaves here in a few days.'\n\n'O, she goes away--that's better. Our lover will be working here at his\ndrawings, and she not present.'\n\n'Exactly. Perhaps she is a little ashamed of the intimacy.'\n\n'And if your design is considered best by the committee, he will have\nno further reason for staying, assuming that they are not definitely\nengaged to marry by that time?'\n\n'I suppose so,' murmured Havill discontentedly. 'The conditions, as sent\nto me, state that the designs are to be adjudicated on by three members\nof the Institute called in for the purpose; so that she may return, and\nhave seemed to show no favour.'\n\n'Then it amounts to this: your design MUST be best. It must combine the\nexcellences of your invention with the excellences of his. Meanwhile a\ncoolness should be made to arise between her and him: and as there\nwould be no artistic reason for his presence here after the verdict is\npronounced, he would perforce hie back to town. Do you see?'\n\n'I see the ingenuity of the plan, but I also see two insurmountable\nobstacles to it. The first is, I cannot add the excellences of his\ndesign to mine without knowing what those excellences are, which he\nwill of course keep a secret. Second, it will not be easy to promote a\ncoolness between such hot ones as they.'\n\n'You make a mistake. It is only he who is so ardent. She is only\nlukewarm. If we had any spirit, a bargain would be struck between us:\nyou would appropriate his design; I should cause the coolness.'\n\n'How could I appropriate his design?'\n\n'By copying it, I suppose.'\n\n'Copying it?'\n\n'By going into his studio and looking it over.'\n\nHavill turned to Dare, and stared. 'By George, you don't stick at\ntrifles, young man. You don't suppose I would go into a man's rooms and\nsteal his inventions like that?'\n\n'I scarcely suppose you would,' said Dare indifferently, as he rose.\n\n'And if I were to,' said Havill curiously, 'how is the coolness to be\ncaused?'\n\n'By the second man.'\n\n'Who is to produce him?'\n\n'Her Majesty's Government.'\n\nHavill looked meditatively at his companion, and shook his head. 'In\nthese idle suppositions we have been assuming conduct which would be\nquite against my principles as an honest man.'\n\n\n\nII.\n\nA few days after the party at Stancy Castle, Dare was walking down the\nHigh Street of Markton, a cigarette between his lips and a silver-topped\ncane in his hand. His eye fell upon a brass plate on an opposite door,\nbearing the name of Mr. Havill, Architect. He crossed over, and rang the\noffice bell.\n\nThe clerk who admitted him stated that Mr. Havill was in his private\nroom, and would be disengaged in a short time. While Dare waited the\nclerk affixed to the door a piece of paper bearing the words 'Back at\n2,' and went away to his dinner, leaving Dare in the room alone.\n\nDare looked at the different drawings on the boards about the room.\nThey all represented one subject, which, though unfinished as yet, and\nbearing no inscription, was recognized by the visitor as the design for\nthe enlargement and restoration of Stancy Castle. When he had glanced it\nover Dare sat down.\n\nThe doors between the office and private room were double; but the one\ntowards the office being only ajar Dare could hear a conversation in\nprogress within. It presently rose to an altercation, the tenor of which\nwas obvious. Somebody had come for money.\n\n'Really I can stand it no longer, Mr. Havill--really I will not!' said\nthe creditor excitedly. 'Now this bill overdue again--what can you\nexpect? Why, I might have negotiated it; and where would you have been\nthen? Instead of that, I have locked it up out of consideration for you;\nand what do I get for my considerateness? I shall let the law take its\ncourse!'\n\n'You'll do me inexpressible harm, and get nothing whatever,' said\nHavill. 'If you would renew for another three months there would be no\ndifficulty in the matter.'\n\n'You have said so before: I will do no such thing.'\n\nThere was a silence; whereupon Dare arose without hesitation, and walked\nboldly into the private office. Havill was standing at one end, as\ngloomy as a thundercloud, and at the other was the unfortunate creditor\nwith his hat on. Though Dare's entry surprised them, both parties seemed\nrelieved.\n\n'I have called in passing to congratulate you, Mr. Havill,' said Dare\ngaily. 'Such a commission as has been entrusted to you will make you\nfamous!'\n\n'How do you do?--I wish it would make me rich,' said Havill drily.\n\n'It will be a lift in that direction, from what I know of the\nprofession. What is she going to spend?'\n\n'A hundred thousand.'\n\n'Your commission as architect, five thousand. Not bad, for making a few\nsketches. Consider what other great commissions such a work will lead\nto.'\n\n'What great work is this?' asked the creditor.\n\n'Stancy Castle,' said Dare, since Havill seemed too agape to answer.\n'You have not heard of it, then? Those are the drawings, I presume, in\nthe next room?'\n\nHavill replied in the affirmative, beginning to perceive the manoeuvre.\n'Perhaps you would like to see them?' he said to the creditor.\n\nThe latter offered no objection, and all three went into the\ndrawing-office.\n\n'It will certainly be a magnificent structure,' said the creditor, after\nregarding the elevations through his spectacles. 'Stancy Castle: I had\nno idea of it! and when do you begin to build, Mr. Havill?' he inquired\nin mollified tones.\n\n'In three months, I think?' said Dare, looking to Havill.\n\nHavill assented.\n\n'Five thousand pounds commission,' murmured the creditor. 'Paid down, I\nsuppose?'\n\nHavill nodded.\n\n'And the works will not linger for lack of money to carry them out, I\nimagine,' said Dare. 'Two hundred thousand will probably be spent before\nthe work is finished.'\n\n'There is not much doubt of it,' said Havill.\n\n'You said nothing to me about this?' whispered the creditor to Havill,\ntaking him aside, with a look of regret.\n\n'You would not listen!'\n\n'It alters the case greatly.' The creditor retired with Havill to the\ndoor, and after a subdued colloquy in the passage he went away, Havill\nreturning to the office.\n\n'What the devil do you mean by hoaxing him like this, when the job is no\nmore mine than Inigo Jones's?'\n\n'Don't be too curious,' said Dare, laughing. 'Rather thank me for\ngetting rid of him.'\n\n'But it is all a vision!' said Havill, ruefully regarding the pencilled\ntowers of Stancy Castle. 'If the competition were really the commission\nthat you have represented it to be there might be something to laugh\nat.'\n\n'It must be made a commission, somehow,' returned Dare carelessly. 'I am\ncome to lend you a little assistance. I must stay in the neighbourhood,\nand I have nothing else to do.'\n\nA carriage slowly passed the window, and Havill recognized the Power\nliveries. 'Hullo--she's coming here!' he said under his breath, as the\ncarriage stopped by the kerb. 'What does she want, I wonder? Dare, does\nshe know you?'\n\n'I would just as soon be out of the way.'\n\n'Then go into the garden.'\n\nDare went out through the back office as Paula was shown in at the\nfront. She wore a grey travelling costume, and seemed to be in some\nhaste.\n\n'I am on my way to the railway-station,' she said to Havill. 'I shall be\nabsent from home for several weeks, and since you requested it, I have\ncalled to inquire how you are getting on with the design.'\n\n'Please look it over,' said Havill, placing a seat for her.\n\n'No,' said Paula. 'I think it would be unfair. I have not looked at\nMr.--the other architect's plans since he has begun to design seriously,\nand I will not look at yours. Are you getting on quite well, and do you\nwant to know anything more? If so, go to the castle, and get anybody to\nassist you. Why would you not make use of the room at your disposal in\nthe castle, as the other architect has done?'\n\nIn asking the question her face was towards the window, and suddenly her\ncheeks became a rosy red. She instantly looked another way.\n\n'Having my own office so near, it was not necessary, thank you,' replied\nHavill, as, noting her countenance, he allowed his glance to stray into\nthe street. Somerset was walking past on the opposite side.\n\n'The time is--the time fixed for sending in the drawings is the first\nof November, I believe,' she said confusedly; 'and the decision will be\ncome to by three gentlemen who are prominent members of the Institute of\nArchitects.'\n\nHavill then accompanied her to the carriage, and she drove away.\n\nHavill went to the back window to tell Dare that he need not stay in the\ngarden; but the garden was empty. The architect remained alone in his\noffice for some time; at the end of a quarter of an hour, when the\nscream of a railway whistle had echoed down the still street, he beheld\nSomerset repassing the window in a direction from the railway, with\nsomewhat of a sad gait. In another minute Dare entered, humming the\nlatest air of Offenbach.\n\n''Tis a mere piece of duplicity!' said Havill.\n\n'What is?'\n\n'Her pretending indifference as to which of us comes out successful in\nthe competition, when she colours carmine the moment Somerset passes\nby.' He described Paula's visit, and the incident.\n\n'It may not mean Cupid's Entire XXX after all,' said Dare judicially.\n'The mere suspicion that a certain man loves her would make a girl blush\nat his unexpected appearance. Well, she's gone from him for a time; the\nbetter for you.'\n\n'He has been privileged to see her off at any rate.'\n\n'Not privileged.'\n\n'How do you know that?'\n\n'I went out of your garden by the back gate, and followed her carriage\nto the railway. He simply went to the first bridge outside the station,\nand waited. When she was in the train, it moved forward; he was all\nexpectation, and drew out his handkerchief ready to wave, while she\nlooked out of the window towards the bridge. The train backed before\nit reached the bridge, to attach the box containing her horses, and the\ncarriage-truck. Then it started for good, and when it reached the bridge\nshe looked out again, he waving his handkerchief to her.'\n\n'And she waving hers back?'\n\n'No, she didn't.'\n\n'Ah!'\n\n'She looked at him--nothing more. I wouldn't give much for his chance.'\nAfter a while Dare added musingly: 'You are a mathematician: did you\never investigate the doctrine of expectations?'\n\n'Never.'\n\nDare drew from his pocket his 'Book of Chances,' a volume as well\nthumbed as the minister's Bible. 'This is a treatise on the subject,' he\nsaid. 'I will teach it to you some day.'\n\n\n\nThe same evening Havill asked Dare to dine with him. He was just at\nthis time living en garcon, his wife and children being away on a visit.\nAfter dinner they sat on till their faces were rather flushed. The talk\nturned, as before, on the castle-competition.\n\n'To know his design is to win,' said Dare. 'And to win is to send him\nback to London where he came from.'\n\nHavill inquired if Dare had seen any sketch of the design while with\nSomerset?\n\n'Not a line. I was concerned only with the old building.'\n\n'Not to know it is to lose, undoubtedly,' murmured Havill.\n\n'Suppose we go for a walk that way, instead of consulting here?'\n\nThey went down the town, and along the highway. When they reached the\nentrance to the park a man driving a basket-carriage came out from the\ngate and passed them by in the gloom.\n\n'That was he,' said Dare. 'He sometimes drives over from the hotel, and\nsometimes walks. He has been working late this evening.'\n\nStrolling on under the trees they met three masculine figures, laughing\nand talking loudly.\n\n'Those are the three first-class London draughtsmen, Bowles, Knowles,\nand Cockton, whom he has engaged to assist him, regardless of expense,'\ncontinued Dare.\n\n'O Lord!' groaned Havill. 'There's no chance for me.'\n\nThe castle now arose before them, endowed by the rayless shade with a\nmore massive majesty than either sunlight or moonlight could impart; and\nHavill sighed again as he thought of what he was losing by Somerset's\nrivalry. 'Well, what was the use of coming here?' he asked.\n\n'I thought it might suggest something--some way of seeing the design.\nThe servants would let us into his room, I dare say.'\n\n'I don't care to ask. Let us walk through the wards, and then homeward.'\n\nThey sauntered on smoking, Dare leading the way through the gate-house\ninto a corridor which was not inclosed, a lamp hanging at the further\nend.\n\n'We are getting into the inhabited part, I think,' said Havill.\n\nDare, however, had gone on, and knowing the tortuous passages from his\nfew days' experience in measuring them with Somerset, he came to the\nbutler's pantry. Dare knocked, and nobody answering he entered, took\ndown a key which hung behind the door, and rejoined Havill. 'It is\nall right,' he said. 'The cat's away; and the mice are at play in\nconsequence.'\n\nProceeding up a stone staircase he unlocked the door of a room in the\ndark, struck a light inside, and returning to the door called in a\nwhisper to Havill, who had remained behind. 'This is Mr. Somerset's\nstudio,' he said.\n\n'How did you get permission?' inquired Havill, not knowing that Dare had\nseen no one.\n\n'Anyhow,' said Dare carelessly. 'We can examine the plans at leisure;\nfor if the placid Mrs. Goodman, who is the only one at home, sees the\nlight, she will only think it is Somerset still at work.'\n\nDare uncovered the drawings, and young Somerset's brain-work for the\nlast six weeks lay under their eyes. To Dare, who was too cursory\nto trouble himself by entering into such details, it had very little\nmeaning; but the design shone into Havill's head like a light into a\ndark place. It was original; and it was fascinating. Its originality lay\npartly in the circumstance that Somerset had not attempted to adapt an\nold building to the wants of the new civilization. He had placed his new\nerection beside it as a slightly attached structure, harmonizing with\nthe old; heightening and beautifying, rather than subduing it. His work\nformed a palace, with a ruinous castle annexed as a curiosity. To\nHavill the conception had more charm than it could have to the most\nappreciative outsider; for when a mediocre and jealous mind that has\nbeen cudgelling itself over a problem capable of many solutions, lights\non the solution of a rival, all possibilities in that kind seem to merge\nin the one beheld.\n\nDare was struck by the arrested expression of the architect's face. 'Is\nit rather good?' he asked.\n\n'Yes, rather,' said Havill, subduing himself.\n\n'More than rather?'\n\n'Yes, the clever devil!' exclaimed Havill, unable to depreciate longer.\n\n'How?'\n\n'The riddle that has worried me three weeks he has solved in a way which\nis simplicity itself. He has got it, and I am undone!'\n\n'Nonsense, don't give way. Let's make a tracing.'\n\n'The ground-plan will be sufficient,' said Havill, his courage reviving.\n'The idea is so simple, that if once seen it is not easily forgotten.'\n\nA rough tracing of Somerset's design was quickly made, and blowing out\nthe candle with a wave of his hand, the younger gentleman locked the\ndoor, and they went downstairs again.\n\n'I should never have thought of it,' said Havill, as they walked\nhomeward.\n\n'One man has need of another every ten years: Ogni dieci anni un uomo ha\nbisogno dell' altro, as they say in Italy. You'll help me for this turn\nif I have need of you?'\n\n'I shall never have the power.'\n\n'O yes, you will. A man who can contrive to get admitted to a\ncompetition by writing a letter abusing another man, has any amount of\npower. The stroke was a good one.'\n\nHavill was silent till he said, 'I think these gusts mean that we are to\nhave a storm of rain.'\n\nDare looked up. The sky was overcast, the trees shivered, and a drop or\ntwo began to strike into the walkers' coats from the east. They were not\nfar from the inn at Sleeping-Green, where Dare had lodgings, occupying\nthe rooms which had been used by Somerset till he gave them up for more\ncommodious chambers at Markton; and they decided to turn in there till\nthe rain should be over.\n\nHaving possessed himself of Somerset's brains Havill was inclined to be\njovial, and ordered the best in wines that the house afforded. Before\nstarting from home they had drunk as much as was good for them; so\nthat their potations here soon began to have a marked effect upon their\ntongues. The rain beat upon the windows with a dull dogged pertinacity\nwhich seemed to signify boundless reserves of the same and long\ncontinuance. The wind rose, the sign creaked, and the candles waved. The\nweather had, in truth, broken up for the season, and this was the first\nnight of the change.\n\n'Well, here we are,' said Havill, as he poured out another glass of the\nbrandied liquor called old port at Sleeping-Green; 'and it seems that\nhere we are to remain for the present.'\n\n'I am at home anywhere!' cried the lad, whose brow was hot and eye wild.\n\nHavill, who had not drunk enough to affect his reasoning, held up his\nglass to the light and said, 'I never can quite make out what you are,\nor what your age is. Are you sixteen, one-and-twenty, or twenty-seven?\nAnd are you an Englishman, Frenchman, Indian, American, or what? You\nseem not to have taken your degrees in these parts.'\n\n'That's a secret, my friend,' said Dare. 'I am a citizen of the world.\nI owe no country patriotism, and no king or queen obedience. A man whose\ncountry has no boundary is your only true gentleman.'\n\n'Well, where were you born--somewhere, I suppose?'\n\n'It would be a fact worth the telling. The secret of my birth lies\nhere.' And Dare slapped his breast with his right hand.\n\n'Literally, just under your shirt-front; or figuratively, in your\nheart?' asked Havill.\n\n'Literally there. It is necessary that it should be recorded, for one's\nown memory is a treacherous book of reference, should verification be\nrequired at a time of delirium, disease, or death.'\n\nHavill asked no further what he meant, and went to the door. Finding\nthat the rain still continued he returned to Dare, who was by this time\nsinking down in a one-sided attitude, as if hung up by the shoulder.\nInforming his companion that he was but little inclined to move far\nin such a tempestuous night, he decided to remain in the inn till next\nmorning. On calling in the landlord, however, they learnt that the house\nwas full of farmers on their way home from a large sheep-fair in the\nneighbourhood, and that several of these, having decided to stay on\naccount of the same tempestuous weather, had already engaged the spare\nbeds. If Mr. Dare would give up his room, and share a double-bedded room\nwith Mr. Havill, the thing could be done, but not otherwise.\n\nTo this the two companions agreed, and presently went upstairs with as\ngentlemanly a walk and vertical a candle as they could exhibit under the\ncircumstances.\n\nThe other inmates of the inn soon retired to rest, and the storm raged\non unheeded by all local humanity.\n\n\n\nIII.\n\nAt two o'clock the rain lessened its fury. At half-past two the obscured\nmoon shone forth; and at three Havill awoke. The blind had not been\npulled down overnight, and the moonlight streamed into the room, across\nthe bed whereon Dare was sleeping. He lay on his back, his arms thrown\nout; and his well-curved youthful form looked like an unpedestaled\nDionysus in the colourless lunar rays.\n\nSleep had cleared Havill's mind from the drowsing effects of the last\nnight's sitting, and he thought of Dare's mysterious manner in speaking\nof himself. This lad resembled the Etruscan youth Tages, in one respect,\nthat of being a boy with, seemingly, the wisdom of a sage; and the\neffect of his presence was now heightened by all those sinister and\nmystic attributes which are lent by nocturnal environment. He who in\nbroad daylight might be but a young chevalier d'industrie was now an\nunlimited possibility in social phenomena. Havill remembered how the lad\nhad pointed to his breast, and said that his secret was literally kept\nthere. The architect was too much of a provincial to have quenched\nthe common curiosity that was part of his nature by the acquired\nmetropolitan indifference to other people's lives which, in essence more\nunworthy even than the former, causes less practical inconvenience in\nits exercise.\n\nDare was breathing profoundly. Instigated as above mentioned, Havill\ngot out of bed and stood beside the sleeper. After a moment's pause he\ngently pulled back the unfastened collar of Dare's nightshirt and saw\na word tattooed in distinct characters on his breast. Before there was\ntime for Havill to decipher it Dare moved slightly, as if conscious of\ndisturbance, and Havill hastened back to bed. Dare bestirred himself yet\nmore, whereupon Havill breathed heavily, though keeping an intent glance\non the lad through his half-closed eyes to learn if he had been aware of\nthe investigation.\n\nDare was certainly conscious of something, for he sat up, rubbed his\neyes, and gazed around the room; then after a few moments of reflection\nhe drew some article from beneath his pillow. A blue gleam shone from\nthe object as Dare held it in the moonlight, and Havill perceived that\nit was a small revolver.\n\nA clammy dew broke out upon the face and body of the architect when,\nstepping out of bed with the weapon in his hand, Dare looked under the\nbed, behind the curtains, out of the window, and into a closet, as if\nconvinced that something had occurred, but in doubt as to what it was.\nHe then came across to where Havill was lying and still keeping up the\nappearance of sleep. Watching him awhile and mistrusting the reality\nof this semblance, Dare brought it to the test by holding the revolver\nwithin a few inches of Havill's forehead.\n\nHavill could stand no more. Crystallized with terror, he said, without\nhowever moving more than his lips, in dread of hasty action on the part\nof Dare: 'O, good Lord, Dare, Dare, I have done nothing!'\n\nThe youth smiled and lowered the pistol. 'I was only finding out whether\nit was you or some burglar who had been playing tricks upon me. I find\nit was you.'\n\n'Do put away that thing! It is too ghastly to produce in a respectable\nbedroom. Why do you carry it?'\n\n'Cosmopolites always do. Now answer my questions. What were you up to?'\nand Dare as he spoke played with the pistol again.\n\nHavill had recovered some coolness. 'You could not use it upon me,' he\nsaid sardonically, watching Dare. 'It would be risking your neck for too\nlittle an object.'\n\n'I did not think you were shrewd enough to see that,' replied Dare\ncarelessly, as he returned the revolver to its place. 'Well, whether you\nhave outwitted me or no, you will keep the secret as long as I choose.'\n\n'Why?' said Havill.\n\n'Because I keep your secret of the letter abusing Miss P., and of the\npilfered tracing you carry in your pocket.'\n\n'It is quite true,' said Havill.\n\nThey went to bed again. Dare was soon asleep; but Havill did not attempt\nto disturb him again. The elder man slept but fitfully. He was aroused\nin the morning by a heavy rumbling and jingling along the highway\noverlooked by the window, the front wall of the house being shaken by\nthe reverberation.\n\n'There is no rest for me here,' he said, rising and going to the window,\ncarefully avoiding the neighbourhood of Mr. Dare. When Havill had\nglanced out he returned to dress himself.\n\n'What's that noise?' said Dare, awakened by the same rumble.\n\n'It is the Artillery going away.'\n\n'From where?'\n\n'Markton barracks.'\n\n'Hurrah!' said Dare, jumping up in bed. 'I have been waiting for that\nthese six weeks.'\n\nHavill did not ask questions as to the meaning of this unexpected\nremark.\n\nWhen they were downstairs Dare's first act was to ring the bell and ask\nif his Army and Navy Gazette had arrived.\n\nWhile the servant was gone Havill cleared his throat and said, 'I am an\narchitect, and I take in the Architect; you are an architect, and you\ntake in the Army and Navy Gazette.'\n\n'I am not an architect any more than I am a soldier; but I have taken in\nthe Army and Navy Gazette these many weeks.'\n\nWhen they were at breakfast the paper came in. Dare hastily tore it open\nand glanced at the pages.\n\n'I am going to Markton after breakfast!' he said suddenly, before\nlooking up; 'we will walk together if you like?'\n\nThey walked together as planned, and entered Markton about ten o'clock.\n\n'I have just to make a call here,' said Dare, when they were opposite\nthe barrack-entrance on the outskirts of the town, where wheel-tracks\nand a regular chain of hoof-marks left by the departed batteries were\nimprinted in the gravel between the open gates. 'I shall not be a\nmoment.' Havill stood still while his companion entered and asked\nthe commissary in charge, or somebody representing him, when the new\nbatteries would arrive to take the place of those which had gone away.\nHe was informed that it would be about noon.\n\n'Now I am at your service,' said Dare, 'and will help you to rearrange\nyour design by the new intellectual light we have acquired.'\n\nThey entered Havill's office and set to work. When contrasted with\nthe tracing from Somerset's plan, Havill's design, which was not far\nadvanced, revealed all its weaknesses to him. After seeing Somerset's\nscheme the bands of Havill's imagination were loosened: he laid his own\nprevious efforts aside, got fresh sheets of drawing-paper and drew with\nvigour.\n\n'I may as well stay and help you,' said Dare. 'I have nothing to do till\ntwelve o'clock; and not much then.'\n\nSo there he remained. At a quarter to twelve children and idlers began\nto gather against the railings of Havill's house. A few minutes past\ntwelve the noise of an arriving host was heard at the entrance to the\ntown. Thereupon Dare and Havill went to the window.\n\nThe X and Y Batteries of the Z Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery, were\nentering Markton, each headed by the major with his bugler behind him.\nIn a moment they came abreast and passed, every man in his place; that\nis to say:\n\nSix shining horses, in pairs, harnessed by rope-traces white as milk,\nwith a driver on each near horse: two gunners on the lead-coloured\nstout-wheeled limber, their carcases jolted to a jelly for lack of\nsprings: two gunners on the lead-coloured stout-wheeled gun-carriage,\nin the same personal condition: the nine-pounder gun, dipping its heavy\nhead to earth, as if ashamed of its office in these enlightened times:\nthe complement of jingling and prancing troopers, riding at the wheels\nand elsewhere: six shining horses with their drivers, and traces white\nas milk, as before: two more gallant jolted men, on another jolting\nlimber, and more stout wheels and lead-coloured paint: two more jolted\nmen on another drooping gun: more jingling troopers on horseback: again\nsix shining draught-horses, traces, drivers, gun, gunners, lead paint,\nstout wheels and troopers as before.\n\nSo each detachment lumbered slowly by, all eyes martially forward,\nexcept when wandering in quest of female beauty.\n\n'He's a fine fellow, is he not?' said Dare, denoting by a nod a mounted\nofficer, with a sallow, yet handsome face, and black moustache, who came\nup on a bay gelding with the men of his battery.\n\n'What is he?' said Havill.\n\n'A captain who lacks advancement.'\n\n'Do you know him?'\n\n'I know him?'\n\n'Yes; do you?'\n\nDare made no reply; and they watched the captain as he rode past with\nhis drawn sword in his hand, the sun making a little sun upon its blade,\nand upon his brilliantly polished long boots and bright spurs; also\nwarming his gold cross-belt and braidings, white gloves, busby with its\nred bag, and tall white plume.\n\nHavill seemed to be too indifferent to press his questioning; and when\nall the soldiers had passed by, Dare observed to his companion that he\nshould leave him for a short time, but would return in the afternoon or\nnext day.\n\nAfter this he walked up the street in the rear of the artillery,\nfollowing them to the barracks. On reaching the gates he found a crowd\nof people gathered outside, looking with admiration at the guns and\ngunners drawn up within the enclosure. When the soldiers were dismissed\nto their quarters the sightseers dispersed, and Dare went through the\ngates to the barrack-yard.\n\nThe guns were standing on the green; the soldiers and horses were\nscattered about, and the handsome captain whom Dare had pointed out to\nHavill was inspecting the buildings in the company of the quartermaster.\nDare made a mental note of these things, and, apparently changing a\nprevious intention, went out from the barracks and returned to the town.\n\n\n\nIV.\n\nTo return for a while to George Somerset. The sun of his later existence\nhaving vanished from that young man's horizon, he confined himself\nclosely to the studio, superintending the exertions of his draughtsmen\nBowles, Knowles, and Cockton, who were now in the full swing of working\nout Somerset's creations from the sketches he had previously prepared.\n\nHe had so far got the start of Havill in the competition that, by the\nhelp of these three gentlemen, his design was soon finished. But he\ngained no unfair advantage on this account, an additional month being\nallowed to Havill to compensate for his later information.\n\nBefore scaling up his drawings Somerset wished to spend a short time in\nLondon, and dismissing his assistants till further notice, he locked up\nthe rooms which had been appropriated as office and studio and prepared\nfor the journey.\n\nIt was afternoon. Somerset walked from the castle in the direction of\nthe wood to reach Markton by a detour. He had not proceeded far when\nthere approached his path a man riding a bay horse with a square-cut\ntail. The equestrian wore a grizzled beard, and looked at Somerset with\na piercing eye as he noiselessly ambled nearer over the soft sod of\nthe park. He proved to be Mr. Cunningham Haze, chief constable of the\ndistrict, who had become slightly known to Somerset during his sojourn\nhere.\n\n'One word, Mr. Somerset,' said the Chief, after they had exchanged nods\nof recognition, reining his horse as he spoke.\n\nSomerset stopped.\n\n'You have a studio at the castle in which you are preparing drawings?'\n\n'I have.'\n\n'Have you a clerk?'\n\n'I had three till yesterday, when I paid them off.'\n\n'Would they have any right to enter the studio late at night?'\n\n'There would have been nothing wrong in their doing so. Either of them\nmight have gone back at any time for something forgotten. They lived\nquite near the castle.'\n\n'Ah, then all is explained. I was riding past over the grass on the\nnight of last Thursday, and I saw two persons in your studio with a\nlight. It must have been about half-past nine o'clock. One of them came\nforward and pulled down the blind so that the light fell upon his face.\nBut I only saw it for a short time.'\n\n'If it were Knowles or Cockton he would have had a beard.'\n\n'He had no beard.'\n\n'Then it must have been Bowles. A young man?'\n\n'Quite young. His companion in the background seemed older.'\n\n'They are all about the same age really. By the way--it couldn't have\nbeen Dare--and Havill, surely! Would you recognize them again?'\n\n'The young one possibly. The other not at all, for he remained in the\nshade.'\n\nSomerset endeavoured to discern in a description by the chief constable\nthe features of Mr. Bowles: but it seemed to approximate more closely to\nDare in spite of himself. 'I'll make a sketch of the only one who had no\nbusiness there, and show it to you,' he presently said. 'I should like\nthis cleared up.'\n\nMr. Cunningham Haze said he was going to Toneborough that afternoon, but\nwould return in the evening before Somerset's departure. With this they\nparted. A possible motive for Dare's presence in the rooms had instantly\npresented itself to Somerset's mind, for he had seen Dare enter Havill's\noffice more than once, as if he were at work there.\n\nHe accordingly sat on the next stile, and taking out his pocket-book\nbegan a pencil sketch of Dare's head, to show to Mr. Haze in the\nevening; for if Dare had indeed found admission with Havill, or as his\nagent, the design was lost.\n\nBut he could not make a drawing that was a satisfactory likeness. Then\nhe luckily remembered that Dare, in the intense warmth of admiration he\nhad affected for Somerset on the first day or two of their acquaintance,\nhad begged for his photograph, and in return for it had left one\nof himself on the mantelpiece, taken as he said by his own process.\nSomerset resolved to show this production to Mr. Haze, as being more\nto the purpose than a sketch, and instead of finishing the latter,\nproceeded on his way.\n\nHe entered the old overgrown drive which wound indirectly through the\nwood to Markton. The road, having been laid out for idling rather than\nfor progress, bent sharply hither and thither among the fissured\ntrunks and layers of horny leaves which lay there all the year round,\ninterspersed with cushions of vivid green moss that formed oases in the\nrust-red expanse.\n\nReaching a point where the road made one of its bends between two large\nbeeches, a man and woman revealed themselves at a few yards' distance,\nwalking slowly towards him. In the short and quaint lady he recognized\nCharlotte De Stancy, whom he remembered not to have seen for several\ndays.\n\nShe slightly blushed and said, 'O, this is pleasant, Mr. Somerset!\nLet me present my brother to you, Captain De Stancy of the Royal Horse\nArtillery.'\n\nHer brother came forward and shook hands heartily with Somerset; and\nthey all three rambled on together, talking of the season, the place,\nthe fishing, the shooting, and whatever else came uppermost in their\nminds.\n\nCaptain De Stancy was a personage who would have been called interesting\nby women well out of their teens. He was ripe, without having declined\na digit towards fogeyism. He was sufficiently old and experienced to\nsuggest a goodly accumulation of touching amourettes in the chambers of\nhis memory, and not too old for the possibility of increasing the store.\nHe was apparently about eight-and-thirty, less tall than his father\nhad been, but admirably made; and his every movement exhibited a fine\ncombination of strength and flexibility of limb. His face was somewhat\nthin and thoughtful, its complexion being naturally pale, though\ndarkened by exposure to a warmer sun than ours. His features were\nsomewhat striking; his moustache and hair raven black; and his eyes,\ndenied the attributes of military keenness by reason of the largeness\nand darkness of their aspect, acquired thereby a softness of expression\nthat was in part womanly. His mouth as far as it could be seen\nreproduced this characteristic, which might have been called weakness,\nor goodness, according to the mental attitude of the observer. It was\nlarge but well formed, and showed an unimpaired line of teeth within.\nHis dress at present was a heather-coloured rural suit, cut close to his\nfigure.\n\n'You knew my cousin, Jack Ravensbury?' he said to Somerset, as they went\non. 'Poor Jack: he was a good fellow.'\n\n'He was a very good fellow.'\n\n'He would have been made a parson if he had lived--it was his great\nwish. I, as his senior, and a man of the world as I thought myself,\nused to chaff him about it when he was a boy, and tell him not to be a\nmilksop, but to enter the army. But I think Jack was right--the parsons\nhave the best of it, I see now.'\n\n'They would hardly admit that,' said Somerset, laughing. 'Nor can I.'\n\n'Nor I,' said the captain's sister. 'See how lovely you all looked with\nyour big guns and uniform when you entered Markton; and then see how\nstupid the parsons look by comparison, when they flock into Markton at a\nVisitation.'\n\n'Ah, yes,' said De Stancy,\n\n     '\"Doubtless it is a brilliant masquerade;\n       But when of the first sight you've had your fill,\n       It palls--at least it does so upon me,\n       This paradise of pleasure and ennui.\"\n\nWhen one is getting on for forty;\n\n       \"When we have made our love, and gamed our gaming,\n          Dressed, voted, shone, and maybe, something more;\n        With dandies dined, heard senators declaiming;\n          Seen beauties brought to market by the score,\"\n\nand so on, there arises a strong desire for a quiet old-fashioned\ncountry life, in which incessant movement is not a necessary part of the\nprogramme.'\n\n'But you are not forty, Will?' said Charlotte.\n\n'My dear, I was thirty-nine last January.'\n\n'Well, men about here are youths at that age. It was India used you up\nso, when you served in the line, was it not? I wish you had never gone\nthere!'\n\n'So do I,' said De Stancy drily. 'But I ought to grow a youth again,\nlike the rest, now I am in my native air.'\n\nThey came to a narrow brook, not wider than a man's stride, and Miss De\nStancy halted on the edge.\n\n'Why, Lottie, you used to jump it easily enough,' said her brother. 'But\nwe won't make her do it now.' He took her in his arms, and lifted\nher over, giving her a gratuitous ride for some additional yards, and\nsaying, 'You are not a pound heavier, Lott, than you were at ten years\nold.... What do you think of the country here, Mr. Somerset? Are you\ngoing to stay long?'\n\n'I think very well of it,' said Somerset. 'But I leave to-morrow\nmorning, which makes it necessary that I turn back in a minute or two\nfrom walking with you.'\n\n'That's a disappointment. I had hoped you were going to finish out\nthe autumn with shooting. There's some, very fair, to be got here on\nreasonable terms, I've just heard.'\n\n'But you need not hire any!' spoke up Charlotte. 'Paula would let you\nshoot anything, I am sure. She has not been here long enough to preserve\nmuch game, and the poachers had it all in Mr. Wilkins' time. But what\nthere is you might kill with pleasure to her.'\n\n'No, thank you,' said De Stancy grimly. 'I prefer to remain a stranger\nto Miss Power--Miss Steam-Power, she ought to be called--and to all her\npossessions.'\n\nCharlotte was subdued, and did not insist further; while Somerset,\nbefore he could feel himself able to decide on the mood in which the\ngallant captain's joke at Paula's expense should be taken, wondered\nwhether it were a married man or a bachelor who uttered it.\n\nHe had not been able to keep the question of De Stancy's domestic state\nout of his head from the first moment of seeing him. Assuming De Stancy\nto be a husband, he felt there might be some excuse for his remark; if\nunmarried, Somerset liked the satire still better; in such circumstances\nthere was a relief in the thought that Captain De Stancy's prejudices\nmight be infinitely stronger than those of his sister or father.\n\n'Going to-morrow, did you say, Mr. Somerset?' asked Miss De Stancy.\n'Then will you dine with us to-day? My father is anxious that you\nshould do so before you go. I am sorry there will be only our own family\npresent to meet you; but you can leave as early as you wish.'\n\nHer brother seconded the invitation, and Somerset promised, though his\nleisure for that evening was short. He was in truth somewhat inclined\nto like De Stancy; for though the captain had said nothing of any value\neither on war, commerce, science, or art, he had seemed attractive\nto the younger man. Beyond the natural interest a soldier has for\nimaginative minds in the civil walks of life, De Stancy's occasional\nmanifestations of taedium vitae were too poetically shaped to\nbe repellent. Gallantry combined in him with a sort of ascetic\nself-repression in a way that was curious. He was a dozen years older\nthan Somerset: his life had been passed in grooves remote from those of\nSomerset's own life; and the latter decided that he would like to meet\nthe artillery officer again.\n\nBidding them a temporary farewell, he went away to Markton by a shorter\npath than that pursued by the De Stancys, and after spending the\nremainder of the afternoon preparing for departure, he sallied forth\njust before the dinner-hour towards the suburban villa.\n\nHe had become yet more curious whether a Mrs. De Stancy existed;\nif there were one he would probably see her to-night. He had an\nirrepressible hope that there might be such a lady. On entering the\ndrawing-room only the father, son, and daughter were assembled. Somerset\nfell into talk with Charlotte during the few minutes before dinner, and\nhis thought found its way out.\n\n'There is no Mrs. De Stancy?' he said in an undertone.\n\n'None,' she said; 'my brother is a bachelor.'\n\nThe dinner having been fixed at an early hour to suit Somerset, they had\nreturned to the drawing-room at eight o'clock. About nine he was aiming\nto get away.\n\n'You are not off yet?' said the captain.\n\n'There would have been no hurry,' said Somerset, 'had I not just\nremembered that I have left one thing undone which I want to attend to\nbefore my departure. I want to see the chief constable to-night.'\n\n'Cunningham Haze?--he is the very man I too want to see. But he went out\nof town this afternoon, and I hardly think you will see him to-night.\nHis return has been delayed.'\n\n'Then the matter must wait.'\n\n'I have left word at his house asking him to call here if he gets home\nbefore half-past ten; but at any rate I shall see him to-morrow morning.\nCan I do anything for you, since you are leaving early?'\n\nSomerset replied that the business was of no great importance, and\nbriefly explained the suspected intrusion into his studio; that he had\nwith him a photograph of the suspected young man. 'If it is a mistake,'\nadded Somerset, 'I should regret putting my draughtsman's portrait into\nthe hands of the police, since it might injure his character; indeed, it\nwould be unfair to him. So I wish to keep the likeness in my own hands,\nand merely to show it to Mr. Haze. That's why I prefer not to send it.'\n\n'My matter with Haze is that the barrack furniture does not correspond\nwith the inventories. If you like, I'll ask your question at the same\ntime with pleasure.'\n\nThereupon Somerset gave Captain De Stancy an unfastened envelope\ncontaining the portrait, asking him to destroy it if the constable\nshould declare it not to correspond with the face that met his eye at\nthe window. Soon after, Somerset took his leave of the household.\n\nHe had not been absent ten minutes when other wheels were heard on the\ngravel without, and the servant announced Mr. Cunningham Haze, who had\nreturned earlier than he had expected, and had called as requested.\n\nThey went into the dining-room to discuss their business. When the\nbarrack matter had been arranged De Stancy said, 'I have a little\ncommission to execute for my friend Mr. Somerset. I am to ask you if\nthis portrait of the person he suspects of unlawfully entering his room\nis like the man you saw there?'\n\nThe speaker was seated on one side of the dining-table and Mr. Haze on\nthe other. As he spoke De Stancy pulled the envelope from his pocket,\nand half drew out the photograph, which he had not as yet looked at,\nto hand it over to the constable. In the act his eye fell upon the\nportrait, with its uncertain expression of age, assured look, and hair\nworn in a fringe like a girl's.\n\nCaptain De Stancy's face became strained, and he leant back in his\nchair, having previously had sufficient power over himself to close the\nenvelope and return it to his pocket.\n\n'Good heavens, you are ill, Captain De Stancy?' said the chief\nconstable.\n\n'It was only momentary,' said De Stancy; 'better in a minute--a glass of\nwater will put me right.'\n\nMr. Haze got him a glass of water from the sideboard.\n\n'These spasms occasionally overtake me,' said De Stancy when he had\ndrunk. 'I am already better. What were we saying? O, this affair of\nMr. Somerset's. I find that this envelope is not the right one.' He\nostensibly searched his pocket again. 'I must have mislaid it,' he\ncontinued, rising. 'I'll be with you again in a moment.'\n\nDe Stancy went into the room adjoining, opened an album of portraits\nthat lay on the table, and selected one of a young man quite unknown\nto him, whose age was somewhat akin to Dare's, but who in no other\nattribute resembled him.\n\nDe Stancy placed this picture in the original envelope, and returned\nwith it to the chief constable, saying he had found it at last.\n\n'Thank you, thank you,' said Cunningham Haze, looking it over. 'Ah--I\nperceive it is not what I expected to see. Mr. Somerset was mistaken.'\n\nWhen the chief constable had left the house, Captain De Stancy shut\nthe door and drew out the original photograph. As he looked at the\ntranscript of Dare's features he was moved by a painful agitation, till\nrecalling himself to the present, he carefully put the portrait into the\nfire.\n\nDuring the following days Captain De Stancy's manner on the roads, in\nthe streets, and at barracks, was that of Crusoe after seeing the print\nof a man's foot on the sand.\n\n\n\nV.\n\nAnybody who had closely considered Dare at this time would have\ndiscovered that, shortly after the arrival of the Royal Horse Artillery\nat Markton Barracks, he gave up his room at the inn at Sleeping-Green\nand took permanent lodgings over a broker's shop in the town\nabove-mentioned. The peculiarity of the rooms was that they commanded\na view lengthwise of the barrack lane along which any soldier, in the\nnatural course of things, would pass either to enter the town, to call\nat Myrtle Villa, or to go to Stancy Castle.\n\nDare seemed to act as if there were plenty of time for his business.\nSome few days had slipped by when, perceiving Captain De Stancy walk\npast his window and into the town, Dare took his hat and cane, and\nfollowed in the same direction. When he was about fifty yards short of\nMyrtle Villa on the other side of the town he saw De Stancy enter its\ngate.\n\nDare mounted a stile beside the highway and patiently waited. In about\ntwenty minutes De Stancy came out again and turned back in the direction\nof the town, till Dare was revealed to him on his left hand. When De\nStancy recognized the youth he was visibly agitated, though apparently\nnot surprised. Standing still a moment he dropped his glance upon the\nground, and then came forward to Dare, who having alighted from the\nstile stood before the captain with a smile.\n\n'My dear lad!' said De Stancy, much moved by recollections. He held\nDare's hand for a moment in both his own, and turned askance.\n\n'You are not astonished,' said Dare, still retaining his smile, as if to\nhis mind there were something comic in the situation.\n\n'I knew you were somewhere near. Where do you come from?'\n\n'From going to and fro in the earth, and walking up and down in it, as\nSatan said to his Maker.--Southampton last, in common speech.'\n\n'Have you come here to see me?'\n\n'Entirely. I divined that your next quarters would be Markton, the\nprevious batteries that were at your station having come on here. I have\nwanted to see you badly.'\n\n'You have?'\n\n'I am rather out of cash. I have been knocking about a good deal since\nyou last heard from me.'\n\n'I will do what I can again.'\n\n'Thanks, captain.'\n\n'But, Willy, I am afraid it will not be much at present. You know I am\nas poor as a mouse.'\n\n'But such as it is, could you write a cheque for it now?'\n\n'I will send it to you from the barracks.'\n\n'I have a better plan. By getting over this stile we could go round\nat the back of the villas to Sleeping-Green Church. There is always a\npen-and-ink in the vestry, and we can have a nice talk on the way. It\nwould be unwise for me to appear at the barracks just now.'\n\n'That's true.'\n\nDe Stancy sighed, and they were about to walk across the fields\ntogether. 'No,' said Dare, suddenly stopping: my plans make it\nimperative that we should not run the risk of being seen in each other's\ncompany for long. Walk on, and I will follow. You can stroll into the\nchurchyard, and move about as if you were ruminating on the epitaphs.\nThere are some with excellent morals. I'll enter by the other gate, and\nwe can meet easily in the vestry-room.'\n\nDe Stancy looked gloomy, and was on the point of acquiescing when he\nturned back and said, 'Why should your photograph be shown to the chief\nconstable?'\n\n'By whom?'\n\n'Somerset the architect. He suspects your having broken into his office\nor something of the sort.' De Stancy briefly related what Somerset had\nexplained to him at the dinner-table.\n\n'It was merely diamond cut diamond between us, on an architectural\nmatter,' murmured Dare. 'Ho! and he suspects; and that's his remedy!'\n\n'I hope this is nothing serious?' asked De Stancy gravely.\n\n'I peeped at his drawing--that's all. But since he chooses to make that\nuse of my photograph, which I gave him in friendship, I'll make use of\nhis in a way he little dreams of. Well now, let's on.'\n\nA quarter of an hour later they met in the vestry of the church at\nSleeping-Green.\n\n'I have only just transferred my account to the bank here,' said De\nStancy, as he took out his cheque-book, 'and it will be more convenient\nto me at present to draw but a small sum. I will make up the balance\nafterwards.'\n\nWhen he had written it Dare glanced over the paper and said ruefully,\n'It is small, dad. Well, there is all the more reason why I should\nbroach my scheme, with a view to making such documents larger in the\nfuture.'\n\n'I shall be glad to hear of any such scheme,' answered De Stancy, with a\nlanguid attempt at jocularity.\n\n'Then here it is. The plan I have arranged for you is of the nature of a\nmarriage.'\n\n'You are very kind!' said De Stancy, agape.\n\n'The lady's name is Miss Paula Power, who, as you may have heard since\nyour arrival, is in absolute possession of her father's property and\nestates, including Stancy Castle. As soon as I heard of her I saw what\na marvellous match it would be for you, and your family; it would make\na man of you, in short, and I have set my mind upon your putting no\nobjection in the way of its accomplishment.'\n\n'But, Willy, it seems to me that, of us two, it is you who exercise\npaternal authority?'\n\n'True, it is for your good. Let me do it.'\n\n'Well, one must be indulgent under the circumstances, I suppose....\nBut,' added De Stancy simply, 'Willy, I--don't want to marry, you know.\nI have lately thought that some day we may be able to live together,\nyou and I: go off to America or New Zealand, where we are not known, and\nthere lead a quiet, pastoral life, defying social rules and troublesome\nobservances.'\n\n'I can't hear of it, captain,' replied Dare reprovingly. 'I am what\nevents have made me, and having fixed my mind upon getting you settled\nin life by this marriage, I have put things in train for it at an\nimmense trouble to myself. If you had thought over it o' nights as much\nas I have, you would not say nay.'\n\n'But I ought to have married your mother if anybody. And as I have not\nmarried her, the least I can do in respect to her is to marry no other\nwoman.'\n\n'You have some sort of duty to me, have you not, Captain De Stancy?'\n\n'Yes, Willy, I admit that I have,' the elder replied reflectively. 'And\nI don't think I have failed in it thus far?'\n\n'This will be the crowning proof. Paternal affection, family pride, the\nnoble instincts to reinstate yourself in the castle of your ancestors,\nall demand the step. And when you have seen the lady! She has the figure\nand motions of a sylph, the face of an angel, the eye of love itself.\nWhat a sight she is crossing the lawn on a sunny afternoon, or gliding\nairily along the corridors of the old place the De Stancys knew so well!\nHer lips are the softest, reddest, most distracting things you ever saw.\nHer hair is as soft as silk, and of the rarest, tenderest brown.'\n\nThe captain moved uneasily. 'Don't take the trouble to say more, Willy,'\nhe observed. 'You know how I am. My cursed susceptibility to these\nmatters has already wasted years of my life, and I don't want to make\nmyself a fool about her too.'\n\n'You must see her.'\n\n'No, don't let me see her,' De Stancy expostulated. 'If she is only half\nso good-looking as you say, she will drag me at her heels like a\nblind Samson. You are a mere youth as yet, but I may tell you that the\nmisfortune of never having been my own master where a beautiful face\nwas concerned obliges me to be cautious if I would preserve my peace of\nmind.'\n\n'Well, to my mind, Captain De Stancy, your objections seem trivial. Are\nthose all?'\n\n'They are all I care to mention just now to you.'\n\n'Captain! can there be secrets between us?'\n\nDe Stancy paused and looked at the lad as if his heart wished to confess\nwhat his judgment feared to tell. 'There should not be--on this point,'\nhe murmured.\n\n'Then tell me--why do you so much object to her?'\n\n'I once vowed a vow.'\n\n'A vow!' said Dare, rather disconcerted.\n\n'A vow of infinite solemnity. I must tell you from the beginning;\nperhaps you are old enough to hear it now, though you have been too\nyoung before. Your mother's life ended in much sorrow, and it was\noccasioned entirely by me. In my regret for the wrong done her I swore\nto her that though she had not been my wife, no other woman should stand\nin that relationship to me; and this to her was a sort of comfort. When\nshe was dead my knowledge of my own plaguy impressionableness, which\nseemed to be ineradicable--as it seems still--led me to think what\nsafeguards I could set over myself with a view to keeping my promise to\nlive a life of celibacy; and among other things I determined to forswear\nthe society, and if possible the sight, of women young and attractive,\nas far as I had the power to do.'\n\n'It is not so easy to avoid the sight of a beautiful woman if she\ncrosses your path, I should think?'\n\n'It is not easy; but it is possible.'\n\n'How?'\n\n'By directing your attention another way.'\n\n'But do you mean to say, captain, that you can be in a room with a\npretty woman who speaks to you, and not look at her?'\n\n'I do: though mere looking has less to do with it than mental\nattentiveness--allowing your thoughts to flow out in her direction--to\ncomprehend her image.'\n\n'But it would be considered very impolite not to look at the woman or\ncomprehend her image?'\n\n'It would, and is. I am considered the most impolite officer in the\nservice. I have been nicknamed the man with the averted eyes--the man\nwith the detestable habit--the man who greets you with his shoulder,\nand so on. Ninety-and-nine fair women at the present moment hate me like\npoison and death for having persistently refused to plumb the depths of\ntheir offered eyes.'\n\n'How can you do it, who are by nature courteous?'\n\n'I cannot always--I break down sometimes. But, upon the whole,\nrecollection holds me to it: dread of a lapse. Nothing is so potent as\nfear well maintained.'\n\nDe Stancy narrated these details in a grave meditative tone with his\neyes on the wall, as if he were scarcely conscious of a listener.\n\n'But haven't you reckless moments, captain?--when you have taken a\nlittle more wine than usual, for instance?'\n\n'I don't take wine.'\n\n'O, you are a teetotaller?'\n\n'Not a pledged one--but I don't touch alcohol unless I get wet, or\nanything of that sort.'\n\n'Don't you sometimes forget this vow of yours to my mother?'\n\n'No, I wear a reminder.'\n\n'What is that like?'\n\nDe Stancy held up his left hand, on the third finger of which appeared\nan iron ring.\n\nDare surveyed it, saying, 'Yes, I have seen that before, though I never\nknew why you wore it. Well, I wear a reminder also, but of a different\nsort.'\n\nHe threw open his shirt-front, and revealed tattooed on his breast the\nletters DE STANCY; the same marks which Havill had seen in the bedroom\nby the light of the moon.\n\nThe captain rather winced at the sight. 'Well, well,' he said hastily,\n'that's enough.... Now, at any rate, you understand my objection to know\nMiss Power.'\n\n'But, captain,' said the lad coaxingly, as he fastened his shirt;\n'you forget me and the good you may do me by marrying? Surely that's a\nsufficient reason for a change of sentiment. This inexperienced sweet\ncreature owns the castle and estate which bears your name, even to the\nfurniture and pictures. She is the possessor of at least forty thousand\na year--how much more I cannot say--while, buried here in Outer Wessex,\nshe lives at the rate of twelve hundred in her simplicity.'\n\n'It is very good of you to set this before me. But I prefer to go on as\nI am going.'\n\n'Well, I won't bore you any more with her to-day. A monk in\nregimentals!--'tis strange.' Dare arose and was about to open the door,\nwhen, looking through the window, Captain De Stancy said, 'Stop.' He\nhad perceived his father, Sir William De Stancy, walking among the\ntombstones without.\n\n'Yes, indeed,' said Dare, turning the key in the door. 'It would look\nstrange if he were to find us here.'\n\nAs the old man seemed indisposed to leave the churchyard just yet they\nsat down again.\n\n'What a capital card-table this green cloth would make,' said Dare, as\nthey waited. 'You play, captain, I suppose?'\n\n'Very seldom.'\n\n'The same with me. But as I enjoy a hand of cards with a friend, I don't\ngo unprovided.' Saying which, Dare drew a pack from the tail of his\ncoat. 'Shall we while away this leisure with the witching things?'\n\n'Really, I'd rather not.'\n\n'But,' coaxed the young man, 'I am in the humour for it; so don't be\nunkind!'\n\n'But, Willy, why do you care for these things? Cards are harmless enough\nin their way; but I don't like to see you carrying them in your pocket.\nIt isn't good for you.'\n\n'It was by the merest chance I had them. Now come, just one hand, since\nwe are prisoners. I want to show you how nicely I can play. I won't\ncorrupt you!'\n\n'Of course not,' said De Stancy, as if ashamed of what his objection\nimplied. 'You are not corrupt enough yourself to do that, I should\nhope.'\n\nThe cards were dealt and they began to play--Captain De Stancy\nabstractedly, and with his eyes mostly straying out of the window upon\nthe large yew, whose boughs as they moved were distorted by the old\ngreen window-panes.\n\n'It is better than doing nothing,' said Dare cheerfully, as the game\nwent on. 'I hope you don't dislike it?'\n\n'Not if it pleases you,' said De Stancy listlessly.\n\n'And the consecration of this place does not extend further than the\naisle wall.'\n\n'Doesn't it?' said De Stancy, as he mechanically played out his cards.\n'What became of that box of books I sent you with my last cheque?'\n\n'Well, as I hadn't time to read them, and as I knew you would not like\nthem to be wasted, I sold them to a bloke who peruses them from morning\ntill night. Ah, now you have lost a fiver altogether--how queer! We'll\ndouble the stakes. So, as I was saying, just at the time the books came\nI got an inkling of this important business, and literature went to the\nwall.'\n\n'Important business--what?'\n\n'The capture of this lady, to be sure.'\n\nDe Stancy sighed impatiently. 'I wish you were less calculating, and had\nmore of the impulse natural to your years!'\n\n'Game--by Jove! You have lost again, captain. That makes--let me\nsee--nine pounds fifteen to square us.'\n\n'I owe you that?' said De Stancy, startled. 'It is more than I have in\ncash. I must write another cheque.'\n\n'Never mind. Make it payable to yourself, and our connection will be\nquite unsuspected.'\n\nCaptain De Stancy did as requested, and rose from his seat. Sir William,\nthough further off, was still in the churchyard.\n\n'How can you hesitate for a moment about this girl?' said Dare, pointing\nto the bent figure of the old man. 'Think of the satisfaction it would\nbe to him to see his son within the family walls again. It should be a\nreligion with you to compass such a legitimate end as this.'\n\n'Well, well, I'll think of it,' said the captain, with an impatient\nlaugh. 'You are quite a Mephistopheles, Will--I say it to my sorrow!'\n\n'Would that I were in your place.'\n\n'Would that you were! Fifteen years ago I might have called the chance a\nmagnificent one.'\n\n'But you are a young man still, and you look younger than you are.\nNobody knows our relationship, and I am not such a fool as to divulge\nit. Of course, if through me you reclaim this splendid possession, I\nshould leave it to your feelings what you would do for me.'\n\nSir William had by this time cleared out of the churchyard, and the pair\nemerged from the vestry and departed. Proceeding towards Markton by the\nsame bypath, they presently came to an eminence covered with bushes of\nblackthorn, and tufts of yellowing fern. From this point a good view of\nthe woods and glades about Stancy Castle could be obtained. Dare\nstood still on the top and stretched out his finger; the captain's eye\nfollowed the direction, and he saw above the many-hued foliage in the\nmiddle distance the towering keep of Paula's castle.\n\n'That's the goal of your ambition, captain--ambition do I say?--most\nrighteous and dutiful endeavour! How the hoary shape catches the\nsunlight--it is the raison d'etre of the landscape, and its possession\nis coveted by a thousand hearts. Surely it is an hereditary desire of\nyours? You must make a point of returning to it, and appearing in the\nmap of the future as in that of the past. I delight in this work of\nencouraging you, and pushing you forward towards your own. You are\nreally very clever, you know, but--I say it with respect--how comes it\nthat you want so much waking up?'\n\n'Because I know the day is not so bright as it seems, my boy. However,\nyou make a little mistake. If I care for anything on earth, I do care\nfor that old fortress of my forefathers. I respect so little among the\nliving that all my reverence is for my own dead. But manoeuvring, even\nfor my own, as you call it, is not in my line. It is distasteful--it is\npositively hateful to me.'\n\n'Well, well, let it stand thus for the present. But will you refuse me\none little request--merely to see her? I'll contrive it so that she may\nnot see you. Don't refuse me, it is the one thing I ask, and I shall\nthink it hard if you deny me.'\n\n'O Will!' said the captain wearily. 'Why will you plead so? No--even\nthough your mind is particularly set upon it, I cannot see her, or\nbestow a thought upon her, much as I should like to gratify you.'\n\n\n\nVI.\n\nWhen they had parted Dare walked along towards Markton with resolve on\nhis mouth and an unscrupulous light in his prominent black eye. Could\nany person who had heard the previous conversation have seen him now, he\nwould have found little difficulty in divining that, notwithstanding De\nStancy's obduracy, the reinstation of Captain De Stancy in the castle,\nand the possible legitimation and enrichment of himself, was still\nthe dream of his brain. Even should any legal settlement or offspring\nintervene to nip the extreme development of his projects, there\nwas abundant opportunity for his glorification. Two conditions were\nimperative. De Stancy must see Paula before Somerset's return. And it\nwas necessary to have help from Havill, even if it involved letting him\nknow all.\n\nWhether Havill already knew all was a nice question for Mr. Dare's\nluminous mind. Havill had had opportunities of reading his secret,\nparticularly on the night they occupied the same room. If so, by\nrevealing it to Paula, Havill might utterly blast his project for the\nmarriage. Havill, then, was at all risks to be retained as an ally.\n\nYet Dare would have preferred a stronger check upon his confederate\nthan was afforded by his own knowledge of that anonymous letter and the\ncompetition trick. For were the competition lost to him, Havill would\nhave no further interest in conciliating Miss Power; would as soon as\nnot let her know the secret of De Stancy's relation to him.\n\nFortune as usual helped him in his dilemma. Entering Havill's office,\nDare found him sitting there; but the drawings had all disappeared from\nthe boards. The architect held an open letter in his hand.\n\n'Well, what news?' said Dare.\n\n'Miss Power has returned to the castle, Somerset is detained in London,\nand the competition is decided,' said Havill, with a glance of quiet\ndubiousness.\n\n'And you have won it?'\n\n'No. We are bracketed--it's a tie. The judges say there is no choice\nbetween the designs--that they are singularly equal and singularly good.\nThat she would do well to adopt either. Signed So-and-So, Fellows of\nthe Royal Institute of British Architects. The result is that she\nwill employ which she personally likes best. It is as if I had spun a\nsovereign in the air and it had alighted on its edge. The least false\nmovement will make it tails; the least wise movement heads.'\n\n'Singularly equal. Well, we owe that to our nocturnal visit, which must\nnot be known.'\n\n'O Lord, no!' said Havill apprehensively.\n\nDare felt secure of him at those words. Havill had much at stake; the\nslightest rumour of his trick in bringing about the competition, would\nbe fatal to Havill's reputation.\n\n'The permanent absence of Somerset then is desirable architecturally on\nyour account, matrimonially on mine.'\n\n'Matrimonially? By the way--who was that captain you pointed out to me\nwhen the artillery entered the town?'\n\n'Captain De Stancy--son of Sir William De Stancy. He's the husband.\nO, you needn't look incredulous: it is practicable; but we won't argue\nthat. In the first place I want him to see her, and to see her in the\nmost love-kindling, passion-begetting circumstances that can be thought\nof. And he must see her surreptitiously, for he refuses to meet her.'\n\n'Let him see her going to church or chapel?'\n\nDare shook his head.\n\n'Driving out?'\n\n'Common-place!'\n\n'Walking in the gardens?'\n\n'Ditto.'\n\n'At her toilet?'\n\n'Ah--if it were possible!'\n\n'Which it hardly is. Well, you had better think it over and make\ninquiries about her habits, and as to when she is in a favourable aspect\nfor observation, as the almanacs say.'\n\nShortly afterwards Dare took his leave. In the evening he made it his\nbusiness to sit smoking on the bole of a tree which commanded a view\nof the upper ward of the castle, and also of the old postern-gate,\nnow enlarged and used as a tradesmen's entrance. It was half-past six\no'clock; the dressing-bell rang, and Dare saw a light-footed young woman\nhasten at the sound across the ward from the servants' quarter. A light\nappeared in a chamber which he knew to be Paula's dressing-room; and\nthere it remained half-an-hour, a shadow passing and repassing on the\nblind in the style of head-dress worn by the girl he had previously\nseen. The dinner-bell sounded and the light went out.\n\nAs yet it was scarcely dark out of doors, and in a few minutes Dare had\nthe satisfaction of seeing the same woman cross the ward and emerge\nupon the slope without. This time she was bonneted, and carried a little\nbasket in her hand. A nearer view showed her to be, as he had expected,\nMilly Birch, Paula's maid, who had friends living in Markton, whom she\nwas in the habit of visiting almost every evening during the three\nhours of leisure which intervened between Paula's retirement from the\ndressing-room and return thither at ten o'clock. When the young woman\nhad descended the road and passed into the large drive, Dare rose and\nfollowed her.\n\n'O, it is you, Miss Birch,' said Dare, on overtaking her. 'I am glad to\nhave the pleasure of walking by your side.'\n\n'Yes, sir. O it's Mr. Dare. We don't see you at the castle now, sir.'\n\n'No. And do you get a walk like this every evening when the others are\nat their busiest?'\n\n'Almost every evening; that's the one return to the poor lady's maid for\nlosing her leisure when the others get it--in the absence of the family\nfrom home.'\n\n'Is Miss Power a hard mistress?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'Rather fanciful than hard, I presume?'\n\n'Just so, sir.'\n\n'And she likes to appear to advantage, no doubt.'\n\n'I suppose so,' said Milly, laughing. 'We all do.'\n\n'When does she appear to the best advantage? When riding, or driving, or\nreading her book?'\n\n'Not altogether then, if you mean the very best.'\n\n'Perhaps it is when she sits looking in the glass at herself, and you\nlet down her hair.'\n\n'Not particularly, to my mind.'\n\n'When does she to your mind? When dressed for a dinner-party or ball?'\n\n'She's middling, then. But there is one time when she looks nicer and\ncleverer than at any. It is when she is in the gymnasium.'\n\n'O--gymnasium?'\n\n'Because when she is there she wears such a pretty boy's costume, and is\nso charming in her movements, that you think she is a lovely young youth\nand not a girl at all.'\n\n'When does she go to this gymnasium?'\n\n'Not so much as she used to. Only on wet mornings now, when she can't\nget out for walks or drives. But she used to do it every day.'\n\n'I should like to see her there.'\n\n'Why, sir?'\n\n'I am a poor artist, and can't afford models. To see her attitudes would\nbe of great assistance to me in the art I love so well.'\n\nMilly shook her head. 'She's very strict about the door being locked. If\nI were to leave it open she would dismiss me, as I should deserve.'\n\n'But consider, dear Miss Birch, the advantage to a poor artist the sight\nof her would be: if you could hold the door ajar it would be worth five\npounds to me, and a good deal to you.'\n\n'No,' said the incorruptible Milly, shaking her head. 'Besides, I don't\nalways go there with her. O no, I couldn't!'\n\nMilly remained so firm at this point that Dare said no more.\n\nWhen he had left her he returned to the castle grounds, and though there\nwas not much light he had no difficulty in discovering the gymnasium,\nthe outside of which he had observed before, without thinking to inquire\nits purpose. Like the erections in other parts of the shrubberies it was\nconstructed of wood, the interstices between the framing being filled up\nwith short billets of fir nailed diagonally. Dare, even when without a\nsettled plan in his head, could arrange for probabilities; and wrenching\nout one of the billets he looked inside. It seemed to be a simple oblong\napartment, fitted up with ropes, with a little dressing-closet at one\nend, and lighted by a skylight or lantern in the roof. Dare replaced the\nwood and went on his way.\n\nHavill was smoking on his doorstep when Dare passed up the street. He\nheld up his hand.\n\n'Since you have been gone,' said the architect, 'I've hit upon something\nthat may help you in exhibiting your lady to your gentleman. In the\nsummer I had orders to design a gymnasium for her, which I did; and they\nsay she is very clever on the ropes and bars. Now--'\n\n'I've discovered it. I shall contrive for him to see her there on the\nfirst wet morning, which is when she practises. What made her think of\nit?'\n\n'As you may have heard, she holds advanced views on social and other\nmatters; and in those on the higher education of women she is very\nstrong, talking a good deal about the physical training of the Greeks,\nwhom she adores, or did. Every philosopher and man of science who\nventilates his theories in the monthly reviews has a devout listener in\nher; and this subject of the physical development of her sex has had its\nturn with other things in her mind. So she had the place built on her\nvery first arrival, according to the latest lights on athletics, and in\nimitation of those at the new colleges for women.'\n\n'How deuced clever of the girl! She means to live to be a hundred!'\n\n\n\nVII.\n\nThe wet day arrived with all the promptness that might have been\nexpected of it in this land of rains and mists. The alder bushes behind\nthe gymnasium dripped monotonously leaf upon leaf, added to this being\nthe purl of the shallow stream a little way off, producing a sense of\nsatiety in watery sounds. Though there was drizzle in the open meads,\nthe rain here in the thicket was comparatively slight, and two men with\nfishing tackle who stood beneath one of the larger bushes found its\nboughs a sufficient shelter.\n\n'We may as well walk home again as study nature here, Willy,' said\nthe taller and elder of the twain. 'I feared it would continue when we\nstarted. The magnificent sport you speak of must rest for to-day.'\n\nThe other looked at his watch, but made no particular reply.\n\n'Come, let us move on. I don't like intruding into other people's\ngrounds like this,' De Stancy continued.\n\n'We are not intruding. Anybody walks outside this fence.' He indicated\nan iron railing newly tarred, dividing the wilder underwood amid which\nthey stood from the inner and well-kept parts of the shrubbery, and\nagainst which the back of the gymnasium was built.\n\nLight footsteps upon a gravel walk could be heard on the other side of\nthe fence, and a trio of cloaked and umbrella-screened figures were\nfor a moment discernible. They vanished behind the gymnasium; and again\nnothing resounded but the river murmurs and the clock-like drippings of\nthe leafage.\n\n'Hush!' said Dare.\n\n'No pranks, my boy,' said De Stancy suspiciously. 'You should be above\nthem.'\n\n'And you should trust to my good sense, captain,' Dare remonstrated. 'I\nhave not indulged in a prank since the sixth year of my pilgrimage. I\nhave found them too damaging to my interests. Well, it is not too dry\nhere, and damp injures your health, you say. Have a pull for safety's\nsake.' He presented a flask to De Stancy.\n\nThe artillery officer looked down at his nether garments.\n\n'I don't break my rule without good reason,' he observed.\n\n'I am afraid that reason exists at present.'\n\n'I am afraid it does. What have you got?'\n\n'Only a little wine.'\n\n'What wine?'\n\n'Do try it. I call it \"the blushful Hippocrene,\" that the poet describes\nas\n\n     \"Tasting of Flora and the country green;\n      Dance, and Provencal song, and sun-burnt mirth.\"'\n\nDe Stancy took the flask, and drank a little.\n\n'It warms, does it not?' said Dare.\n\n'Too much,' said De Stancy with misgiving. 'I have been taken unawares.\nWhy, it is three parts brandy, to my taste, you scamp!'\n\nDare put away the wine. 'Now you are to see something,' he said.\n\n'Something--what is it?' Captain De Stancy regarded him with a puzzled\nlook.\n\n'It is quite a curiosity, and really worth seeing. Now just look in\nhere.'\n\nThe speaker advanced to the back of the building, and withdrew the wood\nbillet from the wall.\n\n'Will, I believe you are up to some trick,' said De Stancy,\nnot, however, suspecting the actual truth in these unsuggestive\ncircumstances, and with a comfortable resignation, produced by the\npotent liquor, which would have been comical to an outsider, but which,\nto one who had known the history and relationship of the two speakers,\nwould have worn a sadder significance. 'I am too big a fool about you to\nkeep you down as I ought; that's the fault of me, worse luck.'\n\nHe pressed the youth's hand with a smile, went forward, and looked\nthrough the hole into the interior of the gymnasium. Dare withdrew\nto some little distance, and watched Captain De Stancy's face, which\npresently began to assume an expression of interest.\n\nWhat was the captain seeing? A sort of optical poem.\n\nPaula, in a pink flannel costume, was bending, wheeling and undulating\nin the air like a gold-fish in its globe, sometimes ascending by her\narms nearly to the lantern, then lowering herself till she swung level\nwith the floor. Her aunt Mrs. Goodman, and Charlotte De Stancy, were\nsitting on camp-stools at one end, watching her gyrations, Paula\noccasionally addressing them with such an expression as--'Now, Aunt,\nlook at me--and you, Charlotte--is not that shocking to your weak\nnerves,' when some adroit feat would be repeated, which, however, seemed\nto give much more pleasure to Paula herself in performing it than to\nMrs. Goodman in looking on, the latter sometimes saying, 'O, it is\nterrific--do not run such a risk again!'\n\nIt would have demanded the poetic passion of some joyous Elizabethan\nlyrist like Lodge, Nash, or Constable, to fitly phrase Paula's\npresentation of herself at this moment of absolute abandonment to every\nmuscular whim that could take possession of such a supple form. The\nwhite manilla ropes clung about the performer like snakes as she took\nher exercise, and the colour in her face deepened as she went on.\nCaptain De Stancy felt that, much as he had seen in early life of beauty\nin woman, he had never seen beauty of such a real and living sort as\nthis. A recollection of his vow, together with a sense that to gaze\non the festival of this Bona Dea was, though so innocent and pretty a\nsight, hardly fair or gentlemanly, would have compelled him to withdraw\nhis eyes, had not the sportive fascination of her appearance glued\nthem there in spite of all. And as if to complete the picture of Grace\npersonified and add the one thing wanting to the charm which bound him,\nthe clouds, till that time thick in the sky, broke away from the upper\nheaven, and allowed the noonday sun to pour down through the lantern\nupon her, irradiating her with a warm light that was incarnadined by her\npink doublet and hose, and reflected in upon her face. She only\nrequired a cloud to rest on instead of the green silk net which actually\nsupported her reclining figure for the moment, to be quite Olympian;\nsave indeed that in place of haughty effrontery there sat on her\ncountenance only the healthful sprightliness of an English girl.\n\nDare had withdrawn to a point at which another path crossed the path\noccupied by De Stancy. Looking in a side direction, he saw Havill\nidling slowly up to him over the silent grass. Havill's knowledge of the\nappointment had brought him out to see what would come of it. When he\nneared Dare, but was still partially hidden by the boughs from the third\nof the party, the former simply pointed to De Stancy upon which Havill\nstood and peeped at him. 'Is she within there?' he inquired.\n\nDare nodded, and whispered, 'You need not have asked, if you had\nexamined his face.'\n\n'That's true.'\n\n'A fermentation is beginning in him,' said Dare, half pitifully; 'a\npurely chemical process; and when it is complete he will probably be\nclear, and fiery, and sparkling, and quite another man than the good,\nweak, easy fellow that he was.'\n\nTo precisely describe Captain De Stancy's admiration was impossible. A\nsun seemed to rise in his face. By watching him they could almost see\nthe aspect of her within the wall, so accurately were her changing\nphases reflected in him. He seemed to forget that he was not alone.\n\n'And is this,' he murmured, in the manner of one only half apprehending\nhimself, 'and is this the end of my vow?'\n\nPaula was saying at this moment, 'Ariel sleeps in this posture, does\nhe not, Auntie?' Suiting the action to the word she flung out her arms\nbehind her head as she lay in the green silk hammock, idly closed her\npink eyelids, and swung herself to and fro.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THE THIRD. DE STANCY.\n\n\n\nI.\n\nCaptain De Stancy was a changed man. A hitherto well-repressed energy\nwas giving him motion towards long-shunned consequences. His features\nwere, indeed, the same as before; though, had a physiognomist chosen to\nstudy them with the closeness of an astronomer scanning the universe, he\nwould doubtless have discerned abundant novelty.\n\nIn recent years De Stancy had been an easy, melancholy, unaspiring\nofficer, enervated and depressed by a parental affection quite beyond\nhis control for the graceless lad Dare--the obtrusive memento of a\nshadowy period in De Stancy's youth, who threatened to be the curse of\nhis old age. Throughout a long space he had persevered in his system of\nrigidly incarcerating within himself all instincts towards the opposite\nsex, with a resolution that would not have disgraced a much stronger\nman. By this habit, maintained with fair success, a chamber of his\nnature had been preserved intact during many later years, like the\none solitary sealed-up cell occasionally retained by bees in a lobe of\ndrained honey-comb. And thus, though he had irretrievably exhausted the\nrelish of society, of ambition, of action, and of his profession, the\nlove-force that he had kept immured alive was still a reproducible\nthing.\n\nThe sight of Paula in her graceful performance, which the judicious\nDare had so carefully planned, led up to and heightened by subtle\naccessories, operated on De Stancy's surprised soul with a promptness\nalmost magical.\n\nOn the evening of the self-same day, having dined as usual, he retired\nto his rooms, where he found a hamper of wine awaiting him. It had been\nanonymously sent, and the account was paid. He smiled grimly, but no\nlonger with heaviness. In this he instantly recognized the handiwork of\nDare, who, having at last broken down the barrier which De Stancy\nhad erected round his heart for so many years, acted like a skilled\nstrategist, and took swift measures to follow up the advantage so\ntardily gained.\n\nCaptain De Stancy knew himself conquered: he knew he should yield to\nPaula--had indeed yielded; but there was now, in his solitude, an hour\nor two of reaction. He did not drink from the bottles sent. He went\nearly to bed, and lay tossing thereon till far into the night, thinking\nover the collapse. His teetotalism had, with the lapse of years,\nunconsciously become the outward and visible sign to himself of\nhis secret vows; and a return to its opposite, however mildly done,\nsignified with ceremonious distinctness the formal acceptance of\ndelectations long forsworn.\n\nBut the exceeding freshness of his feeling for Paula, which by reason of\nits long arrest was that of a man far under thirty, and was a wonder\nto himself every instant, would not long brook weighing in balances. He\nwished suddenly to commit himself; to remove the question of retreat\nout of the region of debate. The clock struck two: and the wish became\ndetermination. He arose, and wrapping himself in his dressing-gown went\nto the next room, where he took from a shelf in the pantry several large\nbottles, which he carried to the window, till they stood on the sill a\ngoodly row. There had been sufficient light in the room for him to do\nthis without a candle. Now he softly opened the sash, and the radiance\nof a gibbous moon riding in the opposite sky flooded the apartment. It\nfell on the labels of the captain's bottles, revealing their contents to\nbe simple aerated waters for drinking.\n\nDe Stancy looked out and listened. The guns that stood drawn up\nwithin the yard glistened in the moonlight reaching them from over the\nbarrack-wall: there was an occasional stamp of horses in the stables;\nalso a measured tread of sentinels--one or more at the gates, one at the\nhospital, one between the wings, two at the magazine, and others further\noff. Recurring to his intention he drew the corks of the mineral waters,\nand inverting each bottle one by one over the window-sill, heard its\ncontents dribble in a small stream on to the gravel below.\n\nHe then opened the hamper which Dare had sent. Uncorking one of the\nbottles he murmured, 'To Paula!' and drank a glass of the ruby liquor.\n\n'A man again after eighteen years,' he said, shutting the sash and\nreturning to his bedroom.\n\nThe first overt result of his kindled interest in Miss Power was his\nsaying to his sister the day after the surreptitious sight of Paula: 'I\nam sorry, Charlotte, for a word or two I said the other day.'\n\n'Well?'\n\n'I was rather disrespectful to your friend Miss Power.'\n\n'I don't think so--were you?'\n\n'Yes. When we were walking in the wood, I made a stupid joke about\nher.... What does she know about me--do you ever speak of me to her?'\n\n'Only in general terms.'\n\n'What general terms?'\n\n'You know well enough, William; of your idiosyncrasies and so on--that\nyou are a bit of a woman-hater, or at least a confirmed bachelor, and\nhave but little respect for your own family.'\n\n'I wish you had not told her that,' said De Stancy with dissatisfaction.\n\n'But I thought you always liked women to know your principles!' said\nCharlotte, in injured tones; 'and would particularly like her to know\nthem, living so near.'\n\n'Yes, yes,' replied her brother hastily. 'Well, I ought to see her, just\nto show her that I am not quite a brute.'\n\n'That would be very nice!' she answered, putting her hands together in\nagreeable astonishment. 'It is just what I have wished, though I did not\ndream of suggesting it after what I have heard you say. I am going to\nstay with her again to-morrow, and I will let her know about this.'\n\n'Don't tell her anything plainly, for heaven's sake. I really want to\nsee the interior of the castle; I have never entered its walls since my\nbabyhood.' He raised his eyes as he spoke to where the walls in question\nshowed their ashlar faces over the trees.\n\n'You might have gone over it at any time.'\n\n'O yes. It is only recently that I have thought much of the place: I\nfeel now that I should like to examine the old building thoroughly,\nsince it was for so many generations associated with our fortunes,\nespecially as most of the old furniture is still there. My sedulous\navoidance hitherto of all relating to our family vicissitudes has been,\nI own, stupid conduct for an intelligent being; but impossible grapes\nare always sour, and I have unconsciously adopted Radical notions to\nobliterate disappointed hereditary instincts. But these have a trick of\nre-establishing themselves as one gets older, and the castle and what it\ncontains have a keen interest for me now.'\n\n'It contains Paula.'\n\nDe Stancy's pulse, which had been beating languidly for many years, beat\ndouble at the sound of that name.\n\n'I meant furniture and pictures for the moment,' he said; 'but I don't\nmind extending the meaning to her, if you wish it.'\n\n'She is the rarest thing there.'\n\n'So you have said before.'\n\n'The castle and our family history have as much romantic interest for\nher as they have for you,' Charlotte went on. 'She delights in visiting\nour tombs and effigies and ponders over them for hours.'\n\n'Indeed!' said De Stancy, allowing his surprise to hide the satisfaction\nwhich accompanied it. 'That should make us friendly.... Does she see\nmany people?'\n\n'Not many as yet. And she cannot have many staying there during the\nalterations.'\n\n'Ah! yes--the alterations. Didn't you say that she has had a London\narchitect stopping there on that account? What was he--old or young?'\n\n'He is a young man: he has been to our house. Don't you remember you met\nhim there?'\n\n'What was his name?'\n\n'Mr. Somerset.'\n\n'O, that man! Yes, yes, I remember.... Hullo, Lottie!'\n\n'What?'\n\n'Your face is as red as a peony. Now I know a secret!' Charlotte vainly\nendeavoured to hide her confusion. 'Very well--not a word! I won't say\nmore,' continued De Stancy good-humouredly, 'except that he seems to be\na very nice fellow.'\n\nDe Stancy had turned the dialogue on to this little well-preserved\nsecret of his sister's with sufficient outward lightness; but it had\nbeen done in instinctive concealment of the disquieting start with which\nhe had recognized that Somerset, Dare's enemy, whom he had intercepted\nin placing Dare's portrait into the hands of the chief constable, was a\nman beloved by his sister Charlotte. This novel circumstance might lead\nto a curious complication. But he was to hear more.\n\n'He may be very nice,' replied Charlotte, with an effort, after this\nsilence. 'But he is nothing to me, more than a very good friend.'\n\n'There's no engagement, or thought of one between you?'\n\n'Certainly there's not!' said Charlotte, with brave emphasis. 'It is\nmore likely to be between Paula and him than me and him.'\n\nDe Stancy's bare military ears and closely cropped poll flushed hot.\n'Miss Power and him?'\n\n'I don't mean to say there is, because Paula denies it; but I mean that\nhe loves Paula. That I do know.'\n\nDe Stancy was dumb. This item of news which Dare had kept from him, not\nknowing how far De Stancy's sense of honour might extend, was decidedly\ngrave. Indeed, he was so greatly impressed with the fact, that he could\nnot help saying as much aloud: 'This is very serious!'\n\n'Why!' she murmured tremblingly, for the first leaking out of her tender\nand sworn secret had disabled her quite.\n\n'Because I love Paula too.'\n\n'What do you say, William, you?--a woman you have never seen?'\n\n'I have seen her--by accident. And now, my dear little sis, you will\nbe my close ally, won't you? as I will be yours, as brother and sister\nshould be.' He placed his arm coaxingly round Charlotte's shoulder.\n\n'O, William, how can I?' at last she stammered.\n\n'Why, how can't you, I should say? We are both in the same ship. I love\nPaula, you love Mr. Somerset; it behoves both of us to see that this\nflirtation of theirs ends in nothing.'\n\n'I don't like you to put it like that--that I love him--it frightens\nme,' murmured the girl, visibly agitated. 'I don't want to divide him\nfrom Paula; I couldn't, I wouldn't do anything to separate them. Believe\nme, Will, I could not! I am sorry you love there also, though I should\nbe glad if it happened in the natural order of events that she should\ncome round to you. But I cannot do anything to part them and make Mr.\nSomerset suffer. It would be TOO wrong and blamable.'\n\n'Now, you silly Charlotte, that's just how you women fly off at a\ntangent. I mean nothing dishonourable in the least. Have I ever prompted\nyou to do anything dishonourable? Fair fighting allies was all I thought\nof.'\n\nMiss De Stancy breathed more freely. 'Yes, we will be that, of course;\nwe are always that, William. But I hope I can be your ally, and be quite\nneutral; I would so much rather.'\n\n'Well, I suppose it will not be a breach of your precious neutrality if\nyou get me invited to see the castle?'\n\n'O no!' she said brightly; 'I don't mind doing such a thing as that.\nWhy not come with me tomorrow? I will say I am going to bring you. There\nwill be no trouble at all.'\n\nDe Stancy readily agreed. The effect upon him of the information now\nacquired was to intensify his ardour tenfold, the stimulus being due to\na perception that Somerset, with a little more knowledge, would hold a\ncard which could be played with disastrous effect against himself--his\nrelationship to Dare. Its disclosure to a lady of such Puritan\nantecedents as Paula's, would probably mean her immediate severance from\nhimself as an unclean thing.\n\n'Is Miss Power a severe pietist, or precisian; or is she a compromising\nlady?' he asked abruptly.\n\n'She is severe and uncompromising--if you mean in her judgments on\nmorals,' said Charlotte, not quite hearing. The remark was peculiarly\napposite, and De Stancy was silent.\n\nHe spent some following hours in a close study of the castle history,\nwhich till now had unutterably bored him. More particularly did he\ndwell over documents and notes which referred to the pedigree of his own\nfamily. He wrote out the names of all--and they were many--who had been\nborn within those domineering walls since their first erection; of those\namong them who had been brought thither by marriage with the owner, and\nof stranger knights and gentlemen who had entered the castle by marriage\nwith its mistress. He refreshed his memory on the strange loves and\nhates that had arisen in the course of the family history; on memorable\nattacks, and the dates of the same, the most memorable among them being\nthe occasion on which the party represented by Paula battered down the\ncastle walls that she was now about to mend, and, as he hoped, return in\ntheir original intact shape to the family dispossessed, by marriage with\nhimself, its living representative.\n\nIn Sir William's villa were small engravings after many of the portraits\nin the castle galleries, some of them hanging in the dining-room in\nplain oak and maple frames, and others preserved in portfolios. De\nStancy spent much of his time over these, and in getting up the romances\nof their originals' lives from memoirs and other records, all which\nstories were as great novelties to him as they could possibly be to any\nstranger. Most interesting to him was the life of an Edward De Stancy,\nwho had lived just before the Civil Wars, and to whom Captain De Stancy\nbore a very traceable likeness. This ancestor had a mole on his cheek,\nblack and distinct as a fly in cream; and as in the case of the first\nLord Amherst's wart, and Bennet Earl of Arlington's nose-scar, the\npainter had faithfully reproduced the defect on canvas. It so happened\nthat the captain had a mole, though not exactly on the same spot of his\nface; and this made the resemblance still greater.\n\nHe took infinite trouble with his dress that day, showing an amount of\nanxiety on the matter which for him was quite abnormal. At last, when\nfully equipped, he set out with his sister to make the call proposed.\nCharlotte was rather unhappy at sight of her brother's earnest attempt\nto make an impression on Paula; but she could say nothing against it,\nand they proceeded on their way.\n\nIt was the darkest of November weather, when the days are so short that\nmorning seems to join with evening without the intervention of noon. The\nsky was lined with low cloud, within whose dense substance tempests\nwere slowly fermenting for the coming days. Even now a windy turbulence\ntroubled the half-naked boughs, and a lonely leaf would occasionally\nspin downwards to rejoin on the grass the scathed multitude of its\ncomrades which had preceded it in its fall. The river by the pavilion,\nin the summer so clear and purling, now slid onwards brown and thick and\nsilent, and enlarged to double size.\n\n\n\nII.\n\nMeanwhile Paula was alone. Of anyone else it would have been said that\nshe must be finding the afternoon rather dreary in the quaint halls\nnot of her forefathers: but of Miss Power it was unsafe to predicate so\nsurely. She walked from room to room in a black velvet dress which\ngave decision to her outline without depriving it of softness. She\noccasionally clasped her hands behind her head and looked out of a\nwindow; but she more particularly bent her footsteps up and down the\nLong Gallery, where she had caused a large fire of logs to be kindled,\nin her endeavour to extend cheerfulness somewhat beyond the precincts of\nthe sitting-rooms.\n\nThe fire glanced up on Paula, and Paula glanced down at the fire, and at\nthe gnarled beech fuel, and at the wood-lice which ran out from beneath\nthe bark to the extremity of the logs as the heat approached them. The\nlow-down ruddy light spread over the dark floor like the setting sun\nover a moor, fluttering on the grotesque countenances of the bright\nandirons, and touching all the furniture on the underside.\n\nShe now and then crossed to one of the deep embrasures of the windows,\nto decipher some sentence from a letter she held in her hand. The\ndaylight would have been more than sufficient for any bystander\nto discern that the capitals in that letter were of the peculiar\nsemi-gothic type affected at the time by Somerset and other young\narchitects of his school in their epistolary correspondence. She was\nvery possibly thinking of him, even when not reading his letter, for the\nexpression of softness with which she perused the page was more or less\nwith her when she appeared to examine other things.\n\nShe walked about for a little time longer, then put away the letter,\nlooked at the clock, and thence returned to the windows, straining her\neyes over the landscape without, as she murmured, 'I wish Charlotte was\nnot so long coming!'\n\nAs Charlotte continued to keep away, Paula became less reasonable in\nher desires, and proceeded to wish that Somerset would arrive; then that\nanybody would come; then, walking towards the portraits on the wall, she\nflippantly asked one of those cavaliers to oblige her fancy for company\nby stepping down from his frame. The temerity of the request led her\nto prudently withdraw it almost as soon as conceived: old paintings had\nbeen said to play queer tricks in extreme cases, and the shadows this\nafternoon were funereal enough for anything in the shape of revenge\non an intruder who embodied the antagonistic modern spirit to such an\nextent as she. However, Paula still stood before the picture which had\nattracted her; and this, by a coincidence common enough in fact,\nthough scarcely credited in chronicles, happened to be that one of\nthe seventeenth-century portraits of which De Stancy had studied the\nengraved copy at Myrtle Villa the same morning.\n\nWhilst she remained before the picture, wondering her favourite wonder,\nhow would she feel if this and its accompanying canvases were pictures\nof her own ancestors, she was surprised by a light footstep upon the\ncarpet which covered part of the room, and turning quickly she beheld\nthe smiling little figure of Charlotte De Stancy.\n\n'What has made you so late?' said Paula. 'You are come to stay, of\ncourse?'\n\nCharlotte said she had come to stay. 'But I have brought somebody with\nme!'\n\n'Ah--whom?'\n\n'My brother happened to be at home, and I have brought him.'\n\nMiss De Stancy's brother had been so continuously absent from home in\nIndia, or elsewhere, so little spoken of, and, when spoken of, so truly\nthough unconsciously represented as one whose interests lay wholly\noutside this antiquated neighbourhood, that to Paula he had been a mere\nnebulosity whom she had never distinctly outlined. To have him thus\ncohere into substance at a moment's notice lent him the novelty of a new\ncreation.\n\n'Is he in the drawing-room?' said Paula in a low voice.\n\n'No, he is here. He would follow me. I hope you will forgive him.'\n\nAnd then Paula saw emerge into the red beams of the dancing fire,\nfrom behind a half-drawn hanging which screened the door, the military\ngentleman whose acquaintance the reader has already made.\n\n'You know the house, doubtless, Captain De Stancy?' said Paula, somewhat\nshyly, when he had been presented to her.\n\n'I have never seen the inside since I was three weeks old,' replied the\nartillery officer gracefully; 'and hence my recollections of it are not\nremarkably distinct. A year or two before I was born the entail was cut\noff by my father and grandfather; so that I saw the venerable place only\nto lose it; at least, I believe that's the truth of the case. But my\nknowledge of the transaction is not profound, and it is a delicate point\non which to question one's father.'\n\nPaula assented, and looked at the interesting and noble figure of the\nman whose parents had seemingly righted themselves at the expense of\nwronging him.\n\n'The pictures and furniture were sold about the same time, I think?'\nsaid Charlotte.\n\n'Yes,' murmured De Stancy. 'They went in a mad bargain of my father with\nhis visitor, as they sat over their wine. My father sat down as host on\nthat occasion, and arose as guest.'\n\nHe seemed to speak with such a courteous absence of regret for the\nalienation, that Paula, who was always fearing that the recollection\nwould rise as a painful shadow between herself and the De Stancys, felt\nreassured by his magnanimity.\n\nDe Stancy looked with interest round the gallery; seeing which Paula\nsaid she would have lights brought in a moment.\n\n'No, please not,' said De Stancy. 'The room and ourselves are of so much\nmore interesting a colour by this light!'\n\nAs they moved hither and thither, the various expressions of De Stancy's\nface made themselves picturesquely visible in the unsteady shine of the\nblaze. In a short time he had drawn near to the painting of the ancestor\nwhom he so greatly resembled. When her quick eye noted the speck on\nthe face, indicative of inherited traits strongly pronounced, a new and\nromantic feeling that the De Stancys had stretched out a tentacle from\ntheir genealogical tree to seize her by the hand and draw her in to\ntheir mass took possession of Paula. As has been said, the De Stancys\nwere a family on whom the hall-mark of membership was deeply stamped,\nand by the present light the representative under the portrait and the\nrepresentative in the portrait seemed beings not far removed. Paula was\ncontinually starting from a reverie and speaking irrelevantly, as if\nsuch reflections as those seized hold of her in spite of her natural\nunconcern.\n\nWhen candles were brought in Captain De Stancy ardently contrived to\nmake the pictures the theme of conversation. From the nearest they went\nto the next, whereupon Paula as hostess took up one of the candlesticks\nand held it aloft to light up the painting. The candlestick being tall\nand heavy, De Stancy relieved her of it, and taking another candle in\nthe other hand, he imperceptibly slid into the position of exhibitor\nrather than spectator. Thus he walked in advance holding the two candles\non high, his shadow forming a gigantic figure on the neighbouring wall,\nwhile he recited the particulars of family history pertaining to each\nportrait, that he had learnt up with such eager persistence during the\nprevious four-and-twenty-hours. 'I have often wondered what could have\nbeen the history of this lady, but nobody has ever been able to tell\nme,' Paula observed, pointing to a Vandyck which represented a beautiful\nwoman wearing curls across her forehead, a square-cut bodice, and a\nheavy pearl necklace upon the smooth expanse of her neck.\n\n'I don't think anybody knows,' Charlotte said.\n\n'O yes,' replied her brother promptly, seeing with enthusiasm that\nit was yet another opportunity for making capital of his acquired\nknowledge, with which he felt himself as inconveniently crammed as a\ncandidate for a government examination. 'That lady has been largely\ncelebrated under a fancy name, though she is comparatively little\nknown by her own. Her parents were the chief ornaments of the\nalmost irreproachable court of Charles the First, and were not more\ndistinguished by their politeness and honour than by the affections and\nvirtues which constitute the great charm of private life.'\n\nThe stock verbiage of the family memoir was somewhat apparent in this\neffusion; but it much impressed his listeners; and he went on to\npoint out that from the lady's necklace was suspended a heart-shaped\nportrait--that of the man who broke his heart by her persistent refusal\nto encourage his suit. De Stancy then led them a little further, where\nhung a portrait of the lover, one of his own family, who appeared in\nfull panoply of plate mail, the pommel of his sword standing up under\nhis elbow. The gallant captain then related how this personage of his\nline wooed the lady fruitlessly; how, after her marriage with another,\nshe and her husband visited the parents of the disappointed lover, the\nthen occupiers of the castle; how, in a fit of desperation at the\nsight of her, he retired to his room, where he composed some passionate\nverses, which he wrote with his blood, and after directing them to her\nran himself through the body with his sword. Too late the lady's heart\nwas touched by his devotion; she was ever after a melancholy woman, and\nwore his portrait despite her husband's prohibition. 'This,' continued\nDe Stancy, leading them through the doorway into the hall where the\ncoats of mail were arranged along the wall, and stopping opposite a\nsuit which bore some resemblance to that of the portrait, 'this is his\narmour, as you will perceive by comparing it with the picture, and this\nis the sword with which he did the rash deed.'\n\n'What unreasonable devotion!' said Paula practically. 'It was too\nromantic of him. She was not worthy of such a sacrifice.'\n\n'He also is one whom they say you resemble a little in feature, I\nthink,' said Charlotte.\n\n'Do they?' replied De Stancy. 'I wonder if it's true.' He set down the\ncandles, and asking the girls to withdraw for a moment, was inside the\nupper part of the suit of armour in incredibly quick time. Going\nthen and placing himself in front of a low-hanging painting near the\noriginal, so as to be enclosed by the frame while covering the figure,\narranging the sword as in the one above, and setting the light that it\nmight fall in the right direction, he recalled them; when he put the\nquestion, 'Is the resemblance strong?'\n\nHe looked so much like a man of bygone times that neither of them\nreplied, but remained curiously gazing at him. His modern and\ncomparatively sallow complexion, as seen through the open visor, lent an\nethereal ideality to his appearance which the time-stained countenance\nof the original warrior totally lacked.\n\nAt last Paula spoke, so stilly that she seemed a statue enunciating:\n'Are the verses known that he wrote with his blood?'\n\n'O yes, they have been carefully preserved.' Captain De Stancy, with\ntrue wooer's instinct, had committed some of them to memory that morning\nfrom the printed copy to be found in every well-ordered library. 'I fear\nI don't remember them all,' he said, 'but they begin in this way:--\n\n     \"From one that dyeth in his discontent,\n      Dear Faire, receive this greeting to thee sent;\n      And still as oft as it is read by thee,\n      Then with some deep sad sigh remember mee!\n\n      O 'twas my fortune's error to vow dutie,\n      To one that bears defiance in her beautie!\n      Sweete poyson, pretious wooe, infectious jewell--\n      Such is a Ladie that is faire and cruell.\n\n      How well could I with ayre, camelion-like,\n      Live happie, and still gazeing on thy cheeke,\n      In which, forsaken man, methink I see\n      How goodlie love doth threaten cares to mee.\n\n      Why dost thou frowne thus on a kneelinge soule,\n      Whose faults in love thou may'st as well controule?--\n      In love--but O, that word; that word I feare\n      Is hateful still both to thy hart and eare!\n\n   .       .       .       .       .\n\n      Ladie, in breefe, my fate doth now intend\n      The period of my daies to have an end:\n      Waste not on me thy pittie, pretious Faire:\n      Rest you in much content; I, in despaire!\"'\n\nA solemn silence followed the close of the recital, which De Stancy\nimproved by turning the point of the sword to his breast, resting the\npommel upon the floor, and saying:--\n\n'After writing that we may picture him turning this same sword in this\nsame way, and falling on it thus.' He inclined his body forward as he\nspoke.\n\n'Don't, Captain De Stancy, please don't!' cried Paula involuntarily.\n\n'No, don't show us any further, William!' said his sister. 'It is too\ntragic.'\n\nDe Stancy put away the sword, himself rather excited--not, however, by\nhis own recital, but by the direct gaze of Paula at him.\n\nThis Protean quality of De Stancy's, by means of which he could assume\nthe shape and situation of almost any ancestor at will, had impressed\nher, and he perceived it with a throb of fervour. But it had done no\nmore than impress her; for though in delivering the lines he had so\nfixed his look upon her as to suggest, to any maiden practised in the\ngame of the eyes, a present significance in the words, the idea of any\nsuch arriere-pensee had by no means commended itself to her soul.\n\nAt this time a messenger from Markton barracks arrived at the castle and\nwished to speak to Captain De Stancy in the hall. Begging the two ladies\nto excuse him for a moment, he went out.\n\nWhile De Stancy was talking in the twilight to the messenger at one end\nof the apartment, some other arrival was shown in by the side door, and\nin making his way after the conference across the hall to the room he\nhad previously quitted, De Stancy encountered the new-comer. There was\njust enough light to reveal the countenance to be Dare's; he bore a\nportfolio under his arm, and had begun to wear a moustache, in case the\nchief constable should meet him anywhere in his rambles, and be struck\nby his resemblance to the man in the studio.\n\n'What the devil are you doing here?' said Captain De Stancy, in tones he\nhad never used before to the young man.\n\nDare started back in surprise, and naturally so. De Stancy, having\nadopted a new system of living, and relinquished the meagre diet and\nenervating waters of his past years, was rapidly recovering tone. His\nvoice was firmer, his cheeks were less pallid; and above all he was\nauthoritative towards his present companion, whose ingenuity in vamping\nup a being for his ambitious experiments seemed about to be rewarded,\nlike Frankenstein's, by his discomfiture at the hands of his own\ncreature.\n\n'What the devil are you doing here, I say?' repeated De Stancy.\n\n'You can talk to me like that, after my working so hard to get you on in\nlife, and make a rising man of you!' expostulated Dare, as one who felt\nhimself no longer the leader in this enterprise.\n\n'But,' said the captain less harshly, 'if you let them discover any\nrelations between us here, you will ruin the fairest prospects man ever\nhad!'\n\n'O, I like that, captain--when you owe all of it to me!'\n\n'That's too cool, Will.'\n\n'No; what I say is true. However, let that go. So now you are here on a\ncall; but how are you going to get here often enough to win her before\nthe other man comes back? If you don't see her every day--twice, three\ntimes a day--you will not capture her in the time.'\n\n'I must think of that,' said De Stancy.\n\n'There is only one way of being constantly here: you must come to copy\nthe pictures or furniture, something in the way he did.'\n\n'I'll think of it,' muttered De Stancy hastily, as he heard the voices\nof the ladies, whom he hastened to join as they were appearing at the\nother end of the room. His countenance was gloomy as he recrossed\nthe hall, for Dare's words on the shortness of his opportunities had\nimpressed him. Almost at once he uttered a hope to Paula that he might\nhave further chance of studying, and if possible of copying, some of the\nancestral faces with which the building abounded.\n\nMeanwhile Dare had come forward with his portfolio, which proved to be\nfull of photographs. While Paula and Charlotte were examining them he\nsaid to De Stancy, as a stranger: 'Excuse my interruption, sir, but if\nyou should think of copying any of the portraits, as you were stating\njust now to the ladies, my patent photographic process is at your\nservice, and is, I believe, the only one which would be effectual in the\ndim indoor lights.'\n\n'It is just what I was thinking of,' said De Stancy, now so far cooled\ndown from his irritation as to be quite ready to accept Dare's adroitly\nsuggested scheme.\n\nOn application to Paula she immediately gave De Stancy permission to\nphotograph to any extent, and told Dare he might bring his instruments\nas soon as Captain De Stancy required them.\n\n'Don't stare at her in such a brazen way!' whispered the latter to the\nyoung man, when Paula had withdrawn a few steps. 'Say, \"I shall highly\nvalue the privilege of assisting Captain De Stancy in such a work.\"'\n\nDare obeyed, and before leaving De Stancy arranged to begin performing\non his venerated forefathers the next morning, the youth so accidentally\nengaged agreeing to be there at the same time to assist in the technical\noperations.\n\n\n\nIII.\n\nAs he had promised, De Stancy made use the next day of the coveted\npermission that had been brought about by the ingenious Dare. Dare's\ntimely suggestion of tendering assistance had the practical result of\nrelieving the other of all necessity for occupying his time with the\nproceeding, further than to bestow a perfunctory superintendence now\nand then, to give a colour to his regular presence in the fortress, the\nactual work of taking copies being carried on by the younger man.\n\nThe weather was frequently wet during these operations, and Paula,\nMiss De Stancy, and her brother, were often in the house whole mornings\ntogether. By constant urging and coaxing the latter would induce his\ngentle sister, much against her conscience, to leave him opportunities\nfor speaking to Paula alone. It was mostly before some print or painting\nthat these conversations occurred, while De Stancy was ostensibly\noccupied with its merits, or in giving directions to his photographer\nhow to proceed. As soon as the dialogue began, the latter would withdraw\nout of earshot, leaving Paula to imagine him the most deferential young\nartist in the world.\n\n'You will soon possess duplicates of the whole gallery,' she said on one\nof these occasions, examining some curled sheets which Dare had printed\noff from the negatives.\n\n'No,' said the soldier. 'I shall not have patience to go on. I get\nill-humoured and indifferent, and then leave off.'\n\n'Why ill-humoured?'\n\n'I scarcely know--more than that I acquire a general sense of my own\nfamily's want of merit through seeing how meritorious the people are\naround me. I see them happy and thriving without any necessity for me at\nall; and then I regard these canvas grandfathers and grandmothers, and\nask, \"Why was a line so antiquated and out of date prolonged till now?\"'\n\nShe chid him good-naturedly for such views. 'They will do you an\ninjury,' she declared. 'Do spare yourself, Captain De Stancy!'\n\nDe Stancy shook his head as he turned the painting before him a little\nfurther to the light.\n\n'But, do you know,' said Paula, 'that notion of yours of being a family\nout of date is delightful to some people. I talk to Charlotte about\nit often. I am never weary of examining those canopied effigies in the\nchurch, and almost wish they were those of my relations.'\n\n'I will try to see things in the same light for your sake,' said De\nStancy fervently.\n\n'Not for my sake; for your own was what I meant, of course,' she replied\nwith a repressive air.\n\nCaptain De Stancy bowed.\n\n'What are you going to do with your photographs when you have them?' she\nasked, as if still anxious to obliterate the previous sentimental lapse.\n\n'I shall put them into a large album, and carry them with me in my\ncampaigns; and may I ask, now I have an opportunity, that you would\nextend your permission to copy a little further, and let me photograph\none other painting that hangs in the castle, to fittingly complete my\nset?'\n\n'Which?'\n\n'That half-length of a lady which hangs in the morning-room. I remember\nseeing it in the Academy last year.'\n\nPaula involuntarily closed herself up. The picture was her own portrait.\n'It does not belong to your series,' she said somewhat coldly.\n\nDe Stancy's secret thought was, I hope from my soul it will belong some\nday! He answered with mildness: 'There is a sort of connection--you are\nmy sister's friend.'\n\nPaula assented.\n\n'And hence, might not your friend's brother photograph your picture?'\n\nPaula demurred.\n\nA gentle sigh rose from the bosom of De Stancy. 'What is to become of\nme?' he said, with a light distressed laugh. 'I am always inconsiderate\nand inclined to ask too much. Forgive me! What was in my mind when I\nasked I dare not say.'\n\n'I quite understand your interest in your family pictures--and all\nof it,' she remarked more gently, willing not to hurt the sensitive\nfeelings of a man so full of romance.\n\n'And in that ONE!' he said, looking devotedly at her. 'If I had only\nbeen fortunate enough to include it with the rest, my album would indeed\nhave been a treasure to pore over by the bivouac fire!'\n\n'O, Captain De Stancy, this is provoking perseverance!' cried Paula,\nlaughing half crossly. 'I expected that after expressing my decision\nso plainly the first time I should not have been further urged upon the\nsubject.' Saying which she turned and moved decisively away.\n\nIt had not been a productive meeting, thus far. 'One word!' said De\nStancy, following and almost clasping her hand. 'I have given offence, I\nknow: but do let it all fall on my own head--don't tell my sister of\nmy misbehaviour! She loves you deeply, and it would wound her to the\nheart.'\n\n'You deserve to be told upon,' said Paula as she withdrew, with just\nenough playfulness to show that her anger was not too serious.\n\nCharlotte looked at Paula uneasily when the latter joined her in the\ndrawing-room. She wanted to say, 'What is the matter?' but guessing that\nher brother had something to do with it, forbore to speak at first. She\ncould not contain her anxiety long. 'Were you talking with my brother?'\nshe said.\n\n'Yes,' returned Paula, with reservation. However, she soon added, 'He\nnot only wants to photograph his ancestors, but MY portrait too. They\nare a dreadfully encroaching sex, and perhaps being in the army makes\nthem worse!'\n\n'I'll give him a hint, and tell him to be careful.'\n\n'Don't say I have definitely complained of him; it is not worth while\nto do that; the matter is too trifling for repetition. Upon the whole,\nCharlotte, I would rather you said nothing at all.'\n\nDe Stancy's hobby of photographing his ancestors seemed to become a\nperfect mania with him. Almost every morning discovered him in\nthe larger apartments of the castle, taking down and rehanging the\ndilapidated pictures, with the assistance of the indispensable Dare;\nhis fingers stained black with dust, and his face expressing a busy\nattention to the work in hand, though always reserving a look askance\nfor the presence of Paula.\n\nThough there was something of subterfuge, there was no deep and double\nsubterfuge in all this. De Stancy took no particular interest in his\nancestral portraits; but he was enamoured of Paula to weakness. Perhaps\nthe composition of his love would hardly bear looking into, but it was\nrecklessly frank and not quite mercenary. His photographic scheme was\nnothing worse than a lover's not too scrupulous contrivance. After the\nrefusal of his request to copy her picture he fumed and fretted at the\nprospect of Somerset's return before any impression had been made on\nher heart by himself; he swore at Dare, and asked him hotly why he had\ndragged him into such a hopeless dilemma as this.\n\n'Hopeless? Somerset must still be kept away, so that it is not hopeless.\nI will consider how to prolong his stay.'\n\nThereupon Dare considered.\n\nThe time was coming--had indeed come--when it was necessary for Paula to\nmake up her mind about her architect, if she meant to begin building in\nthe spring. The two sets of plans, Somerset's and Havill's, were hanging\non the walls of the room that had been used by Somerset as his studio,\nand were accessible by anybody. Dare took occasion to go and study both\nsets, with a view to finding a flaw in Somerset's which might have been\npassed over unnoticed by the committee of architects, owing to their\nabsence from the actual site. But not a blunder could he find.\n\nHe next went to Havill; and here he was met by an amazing state of\naffairs. Havill's creditors, at last suspecting something mythical\nin Havill's assurance that the grand commission was his, had lost all\npatience; his house was turned upside-down, and a poster gleamed on the\nfront wall, stating that the excellent modern household furniture was\nto be sold by auction on Friday next. Troubles had apparently come in\nbattalions, for Dare was informed by a bystander that Havill's wife was\nseriously ill also.\n\nWithout staying for a moment to enter his friend's house, back went\nMr. Dare to the castle, and told Captain De Stancy of the architect's\ndesperate circumstances, begging him to convey the news in some way to\nMiss Power. De Stancy promised to make representations in the proper\nquarter without perceiving that he was doing the best possible deed for\nhimself thereby.\n\nHe told Paula of Havill's misfortunes in the presence of his sister,\nwho turned pale. She discerned how this misfortune would bear upon the\nundecided competition.\n\n'Poor man,' murmured Paula. 'He was my father's architect, and somehow\nexpected, though I did not promise it, the work of rebuilding the\ncastle.'\n\nThen De Stancy saw Dare's aim in sending him to Miss Power with the\nnews; and, seeing it, concurred: Somerset was his rival, and all was\nfair. 'And is he not to have the work of the castle after expecting it?'\nhe asked.\n\nPaula was lost in reflection. 'The other architect's design and Mr.\nHavill's are exactly equal in merit, and we cannot decide how to give it\nto either,' explained Charlotte.\n\n'That is our difficulty,' Paula murmured. 'A bankrupt, and his wife\nill--dear me! I wonder what's the cause.'\n\n'He has borrowed on the expectation of having to execute the castle\nworks, and now he is unable to meet his liabilities.'\n\n'It is very sad,' said Paula.\n\n'Let me suggest a remedy for this dead-lock,' said De Stancy.\n\n'Do,' said Paula.\n\n'Do the work of building in two halves or sections. Give Havill the\nfirst half, since he is in need; when that is finished the second half\ncan be given to your London architect. If, as I understand, the plans\nare identical, except in ornamental details, there will be no difficulty\nabout it at all.'\n\nPaula sighed--just a little one; and yet the suggestion seemed to\nsatisfy her by its reasonableness. She turned sad, wayward, but was\nimpressed by De Stancy's manner and words. She appeared indeed to have\na smouldering desire to please him. In the afternoon she said to\nCharlotte, 'I mean to do as your brother says.'\n\nA note was despatched to Havill that very day, and in an hour the\ncrestfallen architect presented himself at the castle. Paula instantly\ngave him audience, commiserated him, and commissioned him to carry out\na first section of the buildings, comprising work to the extent of about\ntwenty thousand pounds expenditure; and then, with a prematureness quite\namazing among architects' clients, she handed him over a cheque for five\nhundred pounds on account.\n\nWhen he had gone, Paula's bearing showed some sign of being disquieted\nat what she had done; but she covered her mood under a cloak of saucy\nserenity. Perhaps a tender remembrance of a certain thunderstorm in the\nforegoing August when she stood with Somerset in the arbour, and did not\nown that she loved him, was pressing on her memory and bewildering her.\nShe had not seen quite clearly, in adopting De Stancy's suggestion, that\nSomerset would now have no professional reason for being at the castle\nfor the next twelve months.\n\nBut the captain had, and when Havill entered the castle he rejoiced with\ngreat joy. Dare, too, rejoiced in his cold way, and went on with his\nphotography, saying, 'The game progresses, captain.'\n\n'Game? Call it Divine Comedy, rather!' said the soldier exultingly.\n\n'He is practically banished for a year or more. What can't you do in a\nyear, captain!'\n\nHavill, in the meantime, having respectfully withdrawn from the presence\nof Paula, passed by Dare and De Stancy in the gallery as he had done\nin entering. He spoke a few words to Dare, who congratulated him. While\nthey were talking somebody was heard in the hall, inquiring hastily for\nMr. Havill.\n\n'What shall I tell him?' demanded the porter.\n\n'His wife is dead,' said the messenger.\n\nHavill overheard the words, and hastened away.\n\n'An unlucky man!' said Dare.\n\n'That, happily for us, will not affect his installation here,' said De\nStancy. 'Now hold your tongue and keep at a distance. She may come this\nway.'\n\nSurely enough in a few minutes she came. De Stancy, to make\nconversation, told her of the new misfortune which had just befallen Mr.\nHavill.\n\nPaula was very sorry to hear it, and remarked that it gave her great\nsatisfaction to have appointed him as architect of the first wing before\nhe learnt the bad news. 'I owe you best thanks, Captain De Stancy, for\nshowing me such an expedient.'\n\n'Do I really deserve thanks?' asked De Stancy. 'I wish I deserved a\nreward; but I must bear in mind the fable of the priest and the jester.'\n\n'I never heard it.'\n\n'The jester implored the priest for alms, but the smallest sum was\nrefused, though the holy man readily agreed to give him his blessing.\nQuery, its value?'\n\n'How does it apply?'\n\n'You give me unlimited thanks, but deny me the tiniest substantial\ntrifle I desire.'\n\n'What persistence!' exclaimed Paula, colouring. 'Very well, if you\nWILL photograph my picture you must. It is really not worthy further\npleading. Take it when you like.'\n\nWhen Paula was alone she seemed vexed with herself for having given\nway; and rising from her seat she went quietly to the door of the\nroom containing the picture, intending to lock it up till further\nconsideration, whatever he might think of her. But on casting her eyes\nround the apartment the painting was gone. The captain, wisely taking\nthe current when it served, already had it in the gallery, where he\nwas to be seen bending attentively over it, arranging the lights and\ndirecting Dare with the instruments. On leaving he thanked her, and said\nthat he had obtained a splendid copy. Would she look at it?\n\nPaula was severe and icy. 'Thank you--I don't wish to see it,' she said.\n\nDe Stancy bowed and departed in a glow of triumph; satisfied,\nnotwithstanding her frigidity, that he had compassed his immediate aim,\nwhich was that she might not be able to dismiss from her thoughts him\nand his persevering desire for the shadow of her face during the next\nfour-and-twenty-hours. And his confidence was well founded: she could\nnot.\n\n'I fear this Divine Comedy will be slow business for us, captain,' said\nDare, who had heard her cold words.\n\n'O no!' said De Stancy, flushing a little: he had not been perceiving\nthat the lad had the measure of his mind so entirely as to gauge his\nposition at any moment. But he would show no shamefacedness. 'Even if it\nis, my boy,' he answered, 'there's plenty of time before the other can\ncome.'\n\nAt that hour and minute of De Stancy's remark 'the other,' to look\nat him, seemed indeed securely shelved. He was sitting lonely in his\nchambers far away, wondering why she did not write, and yet hoping\nto hear--wondering if it had all been but a short-lived strain of\ntenderness. He knew as well as if it had been stated in words that her\nserious acceptance of him as a suitor would be her acceptance of him as\nan architect--that her schemes in love would be expressed in terms of\nart; and conversely that her refusal of him as a lover would be neatly\neffected by her choosing Havill's plans for the castle, and returning\nhis own with thanks. The position was so clear: he was so well walled in\nby circumstances that he was absolutely helpless.\n\nTo wait for the line that would not come--the letter saying that, as\nshe had desired, his was the design that pleased her--was still the only\nthing to do. The (to Somerset) surprising accident that the committee of\narchitects should have pronounced the designs absolutely equal in point\nof merit, and thus have caused the final choice to revert after all to\nPaula, had been a joyous thing to him when he first heard of it, full\nof confidence in her favour. But the fact of her having again become\nthe arbitrator, though it had made acceptance of his plans all the more\nprobable, made refusal of them, should it happen, all the more crushing.\nHe could have conceived himself favoured by Paula as her lover, even had\nthe committee decided in favour of Havill as her architect. But not to\nbe chosen as architect now was to be rejected in both kinds.\n\n\n\nIV.\n\nIt was the Sunday following the funeral of Mrs. Havill, news of whose\ndeath had been so unexpectedly brought to her husband at the moment of\nhis exit from Stancy Castle. The minister, as was his custom, improved\nthe occasion by a couple of sermons on the uncertainty of life. One\nwas preached in the morning in the old chapel of Markton; the second at\nevening service in the rural chapel near Stancy Castle, built by Paula's\nfather, which bore to the first somewhat the relation of an episcopal\nchapel-of-ease to the mother church.\n\nThe unscreened lights blazed through the plate-glass windows of the\nsmaller building and outshone the steely stars of the early night, just\nas they had done when Somerset was attracted by their glare four months\nbefore. The fervid minister's rhetoric equalled its force on that more\nromantic occasion: but Paula was not there. She was not a frequent\nattendant now at her father's votive building. The mysterious tank,\nwhose dark waters had so repelled her at the last moment, was boarded\nover: a table stood on its centre, with an open quarto Bible upon it,\nbehind which Havill, in a new suit of black, sat in a large chair.\nHavill held the office of deacon: and he had mechanically taken the\ndeacon's seat as usual to-night, in the face of the congregation, and\nunder the nose of Mr. Woodwell.\n\nMr. Woodwell was always glad of an opportunity. He was gifted with a\nburning natural eloquence, which, though perhaps a little too freely\nemployed in exciting the 'Wertherism of the uncultivated,' had in it\ngenuine power. He was a master of that oratory which no limitation\nof knowledge can repress, and which no training can impart. The\nneighbouring rector could eclipse Woodwell's scholarship, and the\nfreethinker at the corner shop in Markton could demolish his logic; but\nthe Baptist could do in five minutes what neither of these had done in a\nlifetime; he could move some of the hardest of men to tears.\n\nThus it happened that, when the sermon was fairly under way, Havill\nbegan to feel himself in a trying position. It was not that he had\nbestowed much affection upon his deceased wife, irreproachable woman as\nshe had been; but the suddenness of her death had shaken his nerves,\nand Mr. Woodwell's address on the uncertainty of life involved\nconsiderations of conduct on earth that bore with singular directness\nupon Havill's unprincipled manoeuvre for victory in the castle\ncompetition. He wished he had not been so inadvertent as to take his\ncustomary chair in the chapel. People who saw Havill's agitation did not\nknow that it was most largely owing to his sense of the fraud which had\nbeen practised on the unoffending Somerset; and when, unable longer to\nendure the torture of Woodwell's words, he rose from his place and went\ninto the chapel vestry, the preacher little thought that remorse for\na contemptibly unfair act, rather than grief for a dead wife, was the\ncause of the architect's withdrawal.\n\nWhen Havill got into the open air his morbid excitement calmed down, but\na sickening self-abhorrence for the proceeding instigated by Dare did\nnot abate. To appropriate another man's design was no more nor less than\nto embezzle his money or steal his goods. The intense reaction from\nhis conduct of the past two or three months did not leave him when\nhe reached his own house and observed where the handbills of the\ncountermanded sale had been torn down, as the result of the payment made\nin advance by Paula of money which should really have been Somerset's.\n\nThe mood went on intensifying when he was in bed. He lay awake till the\nclock reached those still, small, ghastly hours when the vital fires\nburn at their lowest in the human frame, and death seizes more of his\nvictims than in any other of the twenty-four. Havill could bear it no\nlonger; he got a light, went down into his office and wrote the note\nsubjoined.\n\n'MADAM,--The recent death of my wife necessitates a considerable change\nin my professional arrangements and plans with regard to the future.\nOne of the chief results of the change is, I regret to state, that I\nno longer find myself in a position to carry out the enlargement of the\ncastle which you had so generously entrusted to my hands.\n\n'I beg leave therefore to resign all further connection with the same,\nand to express, if you will allow me, a hope that the commission may\nbe placed in the hands of the other competitor. Herewith is returned a\ncheque for one-half of the sum so kindly advanced in anticipation of the\ncommission I should receive; the other half, with which I had cleared\noff my immediate embarrassments before perceiving the necessity for this\ncourse, shall be returned to you as soon as some payments from other\nclients drop in.--I beg to remain, Madam, your obedient servant, JAMES\nHAVILL.'\n\nHavill would not trust himself till the morning to post this letter. He\nsealed it up, went out with it into the street, and walked through the\nsleeping town to the post-office. At the mouth of the box he held the\nletter long. By dropping it, he was dropping at least two thousand five\nhundred pounds which, however obtained, were now securely his. It was a\ngreat deal to let go; and there he stood till another wave of conscience\nbore in upon his soul the absolute nature of the theft, and made him\nshudder. The footsteps of a solitary policeman could be heard nearing\nhim along the deserted street; hesitation ended, and he let the letter\ngo.\n\nWhen he awoke in the morning he thought over the circumstances by the\ncheerful light of a low eastern sun. The horrors of the situation seemed\nmuch less formidable; yet it cannot be said that he actually regretted\nhis act. Later on he walked out, with the strange sense of being a man\nwho, from one having a large professional undertaking in hand, had, by\nhis own act, suddenly reduced himself to an unoccupied nondescript. From\nthe upper end of the town he saw in the distance the grand grey towers\nof Stancy Castle looming over the leafless trees; he felt stupefied at\nwhat he had done, and said to himself with bitter discontent: 'Well,\nwell, what is more contemptible than a half-hearted rogue!'\n\nThat morning the post-bag had been brought to Paula and Mrs. Goodman\nin the usual way, and Miss Power read the letter. His resignation was a\nsurprise; the question whether he would or would not repay the money\nwas passed over; the necessity of installing Somerset after all as sole\narchitect was an agitation, or emotion, the precise nature of which it\nis impossible to accurately define.\n\nHowever, she went about the house after breakfast with very much the\nmanner of one who had had a weight removed either from her heart or from\nher conscience; moreover, her face was a little flushed when, in passing\nby Somerset's late studio, she saw the plans bearing his motto, and knew\nthat his and not Havill's would be the presiding presence in the coming\narchitectural turmoil. She went on further, and called to Charlotte, who\nwas now regularly sleeping in the castle, to accompany her, and together\nthey ascended to the telegraph-room in the donjon tower.\n\n'Whom are you going to telegraph to?' said Miss De Stancy when they\nstood by the instrument.\n\n'My architect.'\n\n'O--Mr. Havill.'\n\n'Mr. Somerset.'\n\nMiss De Stancy had schooled her emotions on that side cruelly well, and\nshe asked calmly, 'What, have you chosen him after all?'\n\n'There is no choice in it--read that,' said Paula, handing Havill's\nletter, as if she felt that Providence had stepped in to shape ends that\nshe was too undecided or unpractised to shape for herself.\n\n'It is very strange,' murmured Charlotte; while Paula applied herself to\nthe machine and despatched the words:--\n\n\n'Miss Power, Stancy Castle, to G. Somerset, Esq., F.S.A., F.R.I.B.A.,\nQueen Anne's Chambers, St. James's.\n\n'Your design is accepted in its entirety. It will be necessary to begin\nsoon. I shall wish to see and consult you on the matter about the 10th\ninstant.'\n\n\nWhen the message was fairly gone out of the window Paula seemed still\nfurther to expand. The strange spell cast over her by something or\nother--probably the presence of De Stancy, and the weird romanticism of\nhis manner towards her, which was as if the historic past had touched\nher with a yet living hand--in a great measure became dissipated,\nleaving her the arch and serene maiden that she had been before.\n\nAbout this time Captain De Stancy and his Achates were approaching the\ncastle, and had arrived about fifty paces from the spot at which it\nwas Dare's custom to drop behind his companion, in order that their\nappearance at the lodge should be that of master and man.\n\nDare was saying, as he had said before: 'I can't help fancying, captain,\nthat your approach to this castle and its mistress is by a very tedious\nsystem. Your trenches, zigzags, counterscarps, and ravelins may be all\nvery well, and a very sure system of attack in the long run; but upon my\nsoul they are almost as slow in maturing as those of Uncle Toby himself.\nFor my part I should be inclined to try an assault.'\n\n'Don't pretend to give advice, Willy, on matters beyond your years.'\n\n'I only meant it for your good, and your proper advancement in the\nworld,' said Dare in wounded tones.\n\n'Different characters, different systems,' returned the soldier. 'This\nlady is of a reticent, independent, complicated disposition, and any\nsudden proceeding would put her on her mettle. You don't dream what\nmy impatience is, my boy. It is a thing transcending your utmost\nconceptions! But I proceed slowly; I know better than to do otherwise.\nThank God there is plenty of time. As long as there is no risk of\nSomerset's return my situation is sure.'\n\n'And professional etiquette will prevent him coming yet. Havill and he\nwill change like the men in a sentry-box; when Havill walks out, he'll\nwalk in, and not a moment before.'\n\n'That will not be till eighteen months have passed. And as the Jesuit\nsaid, \"Time and I against any two.\"... Now drop to the rear,' added\nCaptain De Stancy authoritatively. And they passed under the walls of\nthe castle.\n\nThe grave fronts and bastions were wrapped in silence; so much so,\nthat, standing awhile in the inner ward, they could hear through an open\nwindow a faintly clicking sound from within.\n\n'She's at the telegraph,' said Dare, throwing forward his voice softly\nto the captain. 'What can that be for so early? That wire is a nuisance,\nto my mind; such constant intercourse with the outer world is bad for\nour romance.'\n\nThe speaker entered to arrange his photographic apparatus, of which, in\ntruth, he was getting weary; and De Stancy smoked on the terrace till\nDare should be ready. While he waited his sister looked out upon him\nfrom an upper casement, having caught sight of him as she came from\nPaula in the telegraph-room.\n\n'Well, Lottie, what news this morning?' he said gaily.\n\n'Nothing of importance. We are quite well.'.... She added with\nhesitation, 'There is one piece of news; Mr. Havill--but perhaps you\nhave heard it in Markton?'\n\n'Nothing.'\n\n'Mr. Havill has resigned his appointment as architect to the castle.'\n\n'What?--who has it, then?'\n\n'Mr. Somerset.'\n\n'Appointed?'\n\n'Yes--by telegraph.'\n\n'When is he coming?' said De Stancy in consternation.\n\n'About the tenth, we think.'\n\nCharlotte was concerned to see her brother's face, and withdrew from the\nwindow that he might not question her further. De Stancy went into\nthe hall, and on to the gallery, where Dare was standing as still as a\ncaryatid.\n\n'I have heard every word,' said Dare.\n\n'Well, what does it mean? Has that fool Havill done it on purpose to\nannoy me? What conceivable reason can the man have for throwing up an\nappointment he has worked so hard for, at the moment he has got it, and\nin the time of his greatest need?'\n\nDare guessed, for he had seen a little way into Havill's soul during the\nbrief period of their confederacy. But he was very far from saying what\nhe guessed. Yet he unconsciously revealed by other words the nocturnal\nshades in his character which had made that confederacy possible.\n\n'Somerset coming after all!' he replied. 'By God! that little\nsix-barrelled friend of mine, and a good resolution, and he would never\narrive!'\n\n'What!' said Captain De Stancy, paling with horror as he gathered the\nother's sinister meaning.\n\nDare instantly recollected himself. 'One is tempted to say anything at\nsuch a moment,' he replied hastily.\n\n'Since he is to come, let him come, for me,' continued De Stancy, with\nreactionary distinctness, and still gazing gravely into the young man's\nface. 'The battle shall be fairly fought out. Fair play, even to a\nrival--remember that, boy.... Why are you here?--unnaturally concerning\nyourself with the passions of a man of my age, as if you were the\nparent, and I the son? Would to heaven, Willy, you had done as I wished\nyou to do, and led the life of a steady, thoughtful young man! Instead\nof meddling here, you should now have been in some studio, college, or\nprofessional man's chambers, engaged in a useful pursuit which\nmight have made one proud to own you. But you were so precocious\nand headstrong; and this is what you have come to: you promise to be\nworthless!'\n\n'I think I shall go to my lodgings to-day instead of staying here over\nthese pictures,' said Dare, after a silence during which Captain De\nStancy endeavoured to calm himself. 'I was going to tell you that\nmy dinner to-day will unfortunately be one of herbs, for want of\nthe needful. I have come to my last stiver.--You dine at the mess, I\nsuppose, captain?'\n\nDe Stancy had walked away; but Dare knew that he played a pretty sure\ncard in that speech. De Stancy's heart could not withstand the suggested\ncontrast between a lonely meal of bread-and-cheese and a well-ordered\ndinner amid cheerful companions. 'Here,' he said, emptying his pocket\nand returning to the lad's side. 'Take this, and order yourself a good\nmeal. You keep me as poor as a crow. There shall be more to-morrow.'\n\nThe peculiarly bifold nature of Captain De Stancy, as shown in his\nconduct at different times, was something rare in life, and perhaps\nhappily so. That mechanical admixture of black and white qualities\nwithout coalescence, on which the theory of men's characters was based\nby moral analysis before the rise of modern ethical schools, fictitious\nas it was in general application, would have almost hit off the truth as\nregards Captain De Stancy. Removed to some half-known century, his deeds\nwould have won a picturesqueness of light and shade that might have made\nhim a fascinating subject for some gallery of illustrious historical\npersonages. It was this tendency to moral chequer-work which accounted\nfor his varied bearings towards Dare.\n\nDare withdrew to take his departure. When he had gone a few steps,\ndespondent, he suddenly turned, and ran back with some excitement.\n\n'Captain--he's coming on the tenth, don't they say? Well, four days\nbefore the tenth comes the sixth. Have you forgotten what's fixed for\nthe sixth?'\n\n'I had quite forgotten!'\n\n'That day will be worth three months of quiet attentions: with luck,\nskill, and a bold heart, what mayn't you do?'\n\nCaptain De Stancy's face softened with satisfaction.\n\n'There is something in that; the game is not up after all. The sixth--it\nhad gone clean out of my head, by gad!'\n\n\n\nV.\n\nThe cheering message from Paula to Somerset sped through the loophole\nof Stancy Castle keep, over the trees, along the railway, under bridges,\nacross four counties--from extreme antiquity of environment to sheer\nmodernism--and finally landed itself on a table in Somerset's chambers\nin the midst of a cloud of fog. He read it and, in the moment of\nreaction from the depression of his past days, clapped his hands like a\nchild.\n\nThen he considered the date at which she wanted to see him. Had she\nso worded her despatch he would have gone that very day; but there was\nnothing to complain of in her giving him a week's notice. Pure maiden\nmodesty might have checked her indulgence in a too ardent recall.\n\nTime, however, dragged somewhat heavily along in the interim, and on the\nsecond day he thought he would call on his father and tell him of his\nsuccess in obtaining the appointment.\n\nThe elder Mr. Somerset lived in a detached house in the north-west part\nof fashionable London; and ascending the chief staircase the young\nman branched off from the first landing and entered his father's\npainting-room. It was an hour when he was pretty sure of finding the\nwell-known painter at work, and on lifting the tapestry he was not\ndisappointed, Mr. Somerset being busily engaged with his back towards\nthe door.\n\nArt and vitiated nature were struggling like wrestlers in that\napartment, and art was getting the worst of it. The overpowering gloom\npervading the clammy air, rendered still more intense by the height of\nthe window from the floor, reduced all the pictures that were standing\naround to the wizened feebleness of corpses on end. The shadowy parts\nof the room behind the different easels were veiled in a brown vapour,\nprecluding all estimate of the extent of the studio, and only subdued\nin the foreground by the ruddy glare from an open stove of Dutch tiles.\nSomerset's footsteps had been so noiseless over the carpeting of the\nstairs and landing, that his father was unaware of his presence; he\ncontinued at his work as before, which he performed by the help of a\ncomplicated apparatus of lamps, candles, and reflectors, so arranged as\nto eke out the miserable daylight, to a power apparently sufficient for\nthe neutral touches on which he was at that moment engaged.\n\nThe first thought of an unsophisticated stranger on entering that room\ncould only be the amazed inquiry why a professor of the art of colour,\nwhich beyond all other arts requires pure daylight for its exercise,\nshould fix himself on the single square league in habitable Europe to\nwhich light is denied at noonday for weeks in succession.\n\n'O! it's you, George, is it?' said the Academician, turning from the\nlamps, which shone over his bald crown at such a slant as to reveal\nevery cranial irregularity. 'How are you this morning? Still a dead\nsilence about your grand castle competition?'\n\nSomerset told the news. His father duly congratulated him, and added\ngenially, 'It is well to be you, George. One large commission to attend\nto, and nothing to distract you from it. I am bothered by having a dozen\nirons in the fire at once. And people are so unreasonable.--Only this\nmorning, among other things, when you got your order to go on with your\nsingle study, I received a letter from a woman, an old friend whom I\ncan scarcely refuse, begging me as a great favour to design her a set of\ntheatrical costumes, in which she and her friends can perform for some\ncharity. It would occupy me a good week to go into the subject and do\nthe thing properly. Such are the sort of letters I get. I wish, George,\nyou could knock out something for her before you leave town. It is\npositively impossible for me to do it with all this work in hand, and\nthese eternal fogs to contend against.'\n\n'I fear costumes are rather out of my line,' said the son. 'However,\nI'll do what I can. What period and country are they to represent?'\n\nHis father didn't know. He had never looked at the play of late years.\nIt was 'Love's Labour's Lost.' 'You had better read it for yourself,' he\nsaid, 'and do the best you can.'\n\nDuring the morning Somerset junior found time to refresh his memory of\nthe play, and afterwards went and hunted up materials for designs to\nsuit the same, which occupied his spare hours for the next three days.\nAs these occupations made no great demands upon his reasoning faculties\nhe mostly found his mind wandering off to imaginary scenes at Stancy\nCastle: particularly did he dwell at this time upon Paula's lively\ninterest in the history, relics, tombs, architecture,--nay, the very\nChristian names of the De Stancy line, and her 'artistic' preference\nfor Charlotte's ancestors instead of her own. Yet what more natural\nthan that a clever meditative girl, encased in the feudal lumber of\nthat family, should imbibe at least an antiquarian interest in it?\nHuman nature at bottom is romantic rather than ascetic, and the local\nhabitation which accident had provided for Paula was perhaps acting as\na solvent of the hard, morbidly introspective views thrust upon her in\nearly life.\n\nSomerset wondered if his own possession of a substantial genealogy\nlike Captain De Stancy's would have had any appreciable effect upon her\nregard for him. His suggestion to Paula of her belonging to a worthy\nstrain of engineers had been based on his content with his own\nintellectual line of descent through Pheidias, Ictinus and Callicrates,\nChersiphron, Vitruvius, Wilars of Cambray, William of Wykeham, and\nthe rest of that long and illustrious roll; but Miss Power's marked\npreference for an animal pedigree led him to muse on what he could show\nfor himself in that kind.\n\nThese thoughts so far occupied him that when he took the sketches to\nhis father, on the morning of the fifth, he was led to ask: 'Has any one\never sifted out our family pedigree?'\n\n'Family pedigree?'\n\n'Yes. Have we any pedigree worthy to be compared with that of\nprofessedly old families? I never remember hearing of any ancestor\nfurther back than my great-grandfather.'\n\nSomerset the elder reflected and said that he believed there was a\ngenealogical tree about the house somewhere, reaching back to a very\nrespectable distance. 'Not that I ever took much interest in it,' he\ncontinued, without looking up from his canvas; 'but your great uncle\nJohn was a man with a taste for those subjects, and he drew up such a\nsheet: he made several copies on parchment, and gave one to each of\nhis brothers and sisters. The one he gave to my father is still in my\npossession, I think.'\n\nSomerset said that he should like to see it; but half-an-hour's search\nabout the house failed to discover the document; and the Academician\nthen remembered that it was in an iron box at his banker's. He had used\nit as a wrapper for some title-deeds and other valuable writings which\nwere deposited there for safety. 'Why do you want it?' he inquired.\n\nThe young man confessed his whim to know if his own antiquity would bear\ncomparison with that of another person, whose name he did not mention;\nwhereupon his father gave him a key that would fit the said chest, if he\nmeant to pursue the subject further. Somerset, however, did nothing in\nthe matter that day, but the next morning, having to call at the bank on\nother business, he remembered his new fancy.\n\nIt was about eleven o'clock. The fog, though not so brown as it had been\non previous days, was still dense enough to necessitate lights in the\nshops and offices. When Somerset had finished his business in the\nouter office of the bank he went to the manager's room. The hour being\nsomewhat early the only persons present in that sanctuary of balances,\nbesides the manager who welcomed him, were two gentlemen, apparently\nlawyers, who sat talking earnestly over a box of papers. The manager,\non learning what Somerset wanted, unlocked a door from which a flight\nof stone steps led to the vaults, and sent down a clerk and a porter for\nthe safe.\n\nBefore, however, they had descended far a gentle tap came to the door,\nand in response to an invitation to enter a lady appeared, wrapped up in\nfurs to her very nose.\n\nThe manager seemed to recognize her, for he went across the room in\na moment, and set her a chair at the middle table, replying to some\nobservation of hers with the words, 'O yes, certainly,' in a deferential\ntone.\n\n'I should like it brought up at once,' said the lady.\n\nSomerset, who had seated himself at a table in a somewhat obscure\ncorner, screened by the lawyers, started at the words. The voice\nwas Miss Power's, and so plainly enough was the figure as soon as he\nexamined it. Her back was towards him, and either because the room\nwas only lighted in two places, or because she was absorbed in her own\nconcerns, she seemed to be unconscious of any one's presence on the\nscene except the banker and herself. The former called back the clerk,\nand two other porters having been summoned they disappeared to get\nwhatever she required.\n\nSomerset, somewhat excited, sat wondering what could have brought Paula\nto London at this juncture, and was in some doubt if the occasion were\na suitable one for revealing himself, her errand to her banker being\npossibly of a very private nature. Nothing helped him to a decision.\nPaula never once turned her head, and the progress of time was marked\nonly by the murmurs of the two lawyers, and the ceaseless clash of\ngold and rattle of scales from the outer room, where the busy heads\nof cashiers could be seen through the partition moving about under the\nglobes of the gas-lamps.\n\nFootsteps were heard upon the cellar-steps, and the three men previously\nsent below staggered from the doorway, bearing a huge safe which nearly\nbroke them down. Somerset knew that his father's box, or boxes, could\nboast of no such dimensions, and he was not surprised to see the chest\ndeposited in front of Miss Power. When the immense accumulation of dust\nhad been cleared off the lid, and the chest conveniently placed for her,\nSomerset was attended to, his modest box being brought up by one man\nunassisted, and without much expenditure of breath.\n\nHis interest in Paula was of so emotional a cast that his attention\nto his own errand was of the most perfunctory kind. She was close to\na gas-standard, and the lawyers, whose seats had intervened, having\nfinished their business and gone away, all her actions were visible to\nhim. While he was opening his father's box the manager assisted Paula to\nunseal and unlock hers, and he now saw her lift from it a morocco case,\nwhich she placed on the table before her, and unfastened. Out of it she\ntook a dazzling object that fell like a cascade over her fingers. It\nwas a necklace of diamonds and pearls, apparently of large size and many\nstrands, though he was not near enough to see distinctly. When satisfied\nby her examination that she had got the right article she shut it into\nits case.\n\nThe manager closed the chest for her; and when it was again secured\nPaula arose, tossed the necklace into her hand-bag, bowed to the\nmanager, and was about to bid him good morning. Thereupon he said with\nsome hesitation: 'Pardon one question, Miss Power. Do you intend to take\nthose jewels far?'\n\n'Yes,' she said simply, 'to Stancy Castle.'\n\n'You are going straight there?'\n\n'I have one or two places to call at first.'\n\n'I would suggest that you carry them in some other way--by fastening\nthem into the pocket of your dress, for instance.'\n\n'But I am going to hold the bag in my hand and never once let it go.'\n\nThe banker slightly shook his head. 'Suppose your carriage gets\noverturned: you would let it go then.'\n\n'Perhaps so.'\n\n'Or if you saw a child under the wheels just as you were stepping in; or\nif you accidentally stumbled in getting out; or if there was a collision\non the railway--you might let it go.'\n\n'Yes; I see I was too careless. I thank you.'\n\nPaula removed the necklace from the bag, turned her back to the manager,\nand spent several minutes in placing her treasure in her bosom, pinning\nit and otherwise making it absolutely secure.\n\n'That's it,' said the grey-haired man of caution, with evident\nsatisfaction. 'There is not much danger now: you are not travelling\nalone?'\n\nPaula replied that she was not alone, and went to the door. There\nwas one moment during which Somerset might have conveniently made his\npresence known; but the juxtaposition of the bank-manager, and his own\ndisarranged box of securities, embarrassed him: the moment slipped by,\nand she was gone.\n\nIn the meantime he had mechanically unearthed the pedigree, and, locking\nup his father's chest, Somerset also took his departure at the heels of\nPaula. He walked along the misty street, so deeply musing as to be quite\nunconscious of the direction of his walk. What, he inquired of himself,\ncould she want that necklace for so suddenly? He recollected a remark\nof Dare's to the effect that her appearance on a particular occasion\nat Stancy Castle had been magnificent by reason of the jewels she\nwore; which proved that she had retained a sufficient quantity of those\nvaluables at the castle for ordinary requirements. What exceptional\noccasion, then, was impending on which she wished to glorify herself\nbeyond all previous experience? He could not guess. He was interrupted\nin these conjectures by a carriage nearly passing over his toes at a\ncrossing in Bond Street: looking up he saw between the two windows of\nthe vehicle the profile of a thickly mantled bosom, on which a camellia\nrose and fell. All the remainder part of the lady's person was hidden;\nbut he remembered that flower of convenient season as one which had\nfigured in the bank parlour half-an-hour earlier to-day.\n\nSomerset hastened after the carriage, and in a minute saw it stop\nopposite a jeweller's shop. Out came Paula, and then another woman, in\nwhom he recognized Mrs. Birch, one of the lady's maids at Stancy Castle.\nThe young man was at Paula's side before she had crossed the pavement.\n\n\n\nVI.\n\nA quick arrested expression in her two sapphirine eyes, accompanied by\na little, a very little, blush which loitered long, was all the\noutward disturbance that the sight of her lover caused. The habit of\nself-repression at any new emotional impact was instinctive with her\nalways. Somerset could not say more than a word; he looked his intense\nsolicitude, and Paula spoke.\n\nShe declared that this was an unexpected pleasure. Had he arranged\nto come on the tenth as she wished? How strange that they should meet\nthus!--and yet not strange--the world was so small.\n\nSomerset said that he was coming on the very day she mentioned--that the\nappointment gave him infinite gratification, which was quite within the\ntruth.\n\n'Come into this shop with me,' said Paula, with good-humoured\nauthoritativeness.\n\nThey entered the shop and talked on while she made a small purchase. But\nnot a word did Paula say of her sudden errand to town.\n\n'I am having an exciting morning,' she said. 'I am going from here to\ncatch the one-o'clock train to Markton.'\n\n'It is important that you get there this afternoon, I suppose?'\n\n'Yes. You know why?'\n\n'Not at all.'\n\n'The Hunt Ball. It was fixed for the sixth, and this is the sixth. I\nthought they might have asked you.'\n\n'No,' said Somerset, a trifle gloomily. 'No, I am not asked. But it is a\ngreat task for you--a long journey and a ball all in one day.'\n\n'Yes: Charlotte said that. But I don't mind it.'\n\n'You are glad you are going. Are you glad?' he said softly.\n\nHer air confessed more than her words. 'I am not so very glad that I am\ngoing to the Hunt Ball,' she replied confidentially.\n\n'Thanks for that,' said he.\n\nShe lifted her eyes to his for a moment. Her manner had suddenly become\nso nearly the counterpart of that in the tea-house that to suspect any\ndeterioration of affection in her was no longer generous. It was only as\nif a thin layer of recent events had overlaid her memories of him, until\nhis presence swept them away.\n\nSomerset looked up, and finding the shopman to be still some way off,\nhe added, 'When will you assure me of something in return for what I\nassured you that evening in the rain?'\n\n'Not before you have built the castle. My aunt does not know about it\nyet, nor anybody.'\n\n'I ought to tell her.'\n\n'No, not yet. I don't wish it.'\n\n'Then everything stands as usual?'\n\nShe lightly nodded.\n\n'That is, I may love you: but you still will not say you love me.'\n\nShe nodded again, and directing his attention to the advancing shopman,\nsaid, 'Please not a word more.'\n\nSoon after this, they left the jeweller's, and parted, Paula driving\nstraight off to the station and Somerset going on his way uncertainly\nhappy. His re-impression after a few minutes was that a special journey\nto town to fetch that magnificent necklace which she had not once\nmentioned to him, but which was plainly to be the medium of some proud\npurpose with her this evening, was hardly in harmony with her assertions\nof indifference to the attractions of the Hunt Ball.\n\nHe got into a cab and drove to his club, where he lunched, and mopingly\nspent a great part of the afternoon in making calculations for the\nfoundations of the castle works. Later in the afternoon he returned to\nhis chambers, wishing that he could annihilate the three days remaining\nbefore the tenth, particularly this coming evening. On his table was a\nletter in a strange writing, and indifferently turning it over he found\nfrom the superscription that it had been addressed to him days before at\nthe Lord-Quantock-Arms Hotel, Markton, where it had lain ever since, the\nlandlord probably expecting him to return. Opening the missive, he found\nto his surprise that it was, after all, an invitation to the Hunt Ball.\n\n'Too late!' said Somerset. 'To think I should be served this trick a\nsecond time!'\n\nAfter a moment's pause, however, he looked to see the time of day. It\nwas five minutes past five--just about the hour when Paula would be\ndriving from Markton Station to Stancy Castle to rest and prepare\nherself for her evening triumph. There was a train at six o'clock, timed\nto reach Markton between eleven and twelve, which by great exertion he\nmight save even now, if it were worth while to undertake such a scramble\nfor the pleasure of dropping in to the ball at a late hour. A moment's\nvision of Paula moving to swift tunes on the arm of a person or persons\nunknown was enough to impart the impetus required. He jumped up, flung\nhis dress clothes into a portmanteau, sent down to call a cab, and in a\nfew minutes was rattling off to the railway which had borne Paula away\nfrom London just five hours earlier.\n\nOnce in the train, he began to consider where and how he could\nmost conveniently dress for the dance. The train would certainly\nbe half-an-hour late; half-an-hour would be spent in getting to the\ntown-hall, and that was the utmost delay tolerable if he would secure\nthe hand of Paula for one spin, or be more than a mere dummy behind\nthe earlier arrivals. He looked for an empty compartment at the next\nstoppage, and finding the one next his own unoccupied, he entered it and\nchanged his raiment for that in his portmanteau during the ensuing run\nof twenty miles.\n\nThus prepared he awaited the Markton platform, which was reached as\nthe clock struck twelve. Somerset called a fly and drove at once to the\ntown-hall.\n\nThe borough natives had ascended to their upper floors, and were putting\nout their candles one by one as he passed along the streets; but\nthe lively strains that proceeded from the central edifice revealed\ndistinctly enough what was going on among the temporary visitors from\nthe neighbouring manors. The doors were opened for him, and entering\nthe vestibule lined with flags, flowers, evergreens, and escutcheons, he\nstood looking into the furnace of gaiety beyond.\n\nIt was some time before he could gather his impressions of the scene,\nso perplexing were the lights, the motions, the toilets, the full-dress\nuniforms of officers and the harmonies of sound. Yet light, sound, and\nmovement were not so much the essence of that giddy scene as an intense\naim at obliviousness in the beings composing it. For two or three hours\nat least those whirling young people meant not to know that they were\nmortal. The room was beating like a heart, and the pulse was regulated\nby the trembling strings of the most popular quadrille band in Wessex.\nBut at last his eyes grew settled enough to look critically around.\n\nThe room was crowded--too crowded. Every variety of fair one, beauties\nprimary, secondary, and tertiary, appeared among the personages\ncomposing the throng. There were suns and moons; also pale planets of\nlittle account. Broadly speaking, these daughters of the county\nfell into two classes: one the pink-faced unsophisticated girls from\nneighbouring rectories and small country-houses, who knew not town\nexcept for an occasional fortnight, and who spent their time from Easter\nto Lammas Day much as they spent it during the remaining nine months of\nthe year: the other class were the children of the wealthy landowners\nwho migrated each season to the town-house; these were pale and\ncollected, showed less enjoyment in their countenances, and wore in\ngeneral an approximation to the languid manners of the capital.\n\nA quadrille was in progress, and Somerset scanned each set. His mind had\nrun so long upon the necklace, that his glance involuntarily sought out\nthat gleaming object rather than the personality of its wearer. At the\ntop of the room there he beheld it; but it was on the neck of Charlotte\nDe Stancy.\n\nThe whole lucid explanation broke across his understanding in a second.\nHis dear Paula had fetched the necklace that Charlotte should not appear\nto disadvantage among the county people by reason of her poverty. It was\ngenerously done--a disinterested act of sisterly kindness; theirs was\nthe friendship of Hermia and Helena. Before he had got further than\nto realize this, there wheeled round amongst the dancers a lady whose\ntournure he recognized well. She was Paula; and to the young man's\nvision a superlative something distinguished her from all the rest. This\nwas not dress or ornament, for she had hardly a gem upon her, her\nattire being a model of effective simplicity. Her partner was Captain De\nStancy.\n\nThe discovery of this latter fact slightly obscured his appreciation of\nwhat he had discovered just before. It was with rather a lowering brow\nthat he asked himself whether Paula's predilection d'artiste, as she\ncalled it, for the De Stancy line might not lead to a predilection of\na different sort for its last representative which would be not at all\nsatisfactory.\n\nThe architect remained in the background till the dance drew to a\nconclusion, and then he went forward. The circumstance of having met him\nby accident once already that day seemed to quench any surprise in Miss\nPower's bosom at seeing him now. There was nothing in her parting\nfrom Captain De Stancy, when he led her to a seat, calculated to make\nSomerset uneasy after his long absence. Though, for that matter, this\nproved nothing; for, like all wise maidens, Paula never ventured on the\ngame of the eyes with a lover in public; well knowing that every moment\nof such indulgence overnight might mean an hour's sneer at her expense\nby the indulged gentleman next day, when weighing womankind by the aid\nof a cold morning light and a bad headache.\n\nWhile Somerset was explaining to Paula and her aunt the reason of his\nsudden appearance, their attention was drawn to a seat a short way off\nby a fluttering of ladies round the spot. In a moment it was whispered\nthat somebody had fallen ill, and in another that the sufferer was Miss\nDe Stancy. Paula, Mrs. Goodman, and Somerset at once joined the group of\nfriends who were assisting her. Neither of them imagined for an instant\nthat the unexpected advent of Somerset on the scene had anything to do\nwith the poor girl's indisposition.\n\nShe was assisted out of the room, and her brother, who now came up,\nprepared to take her home, Somerset exchanging a few civil words with\nhim, which the hurry of the moment prevented them from continuing;\nthough on taking his leave with Charlotte, who was now better, De Stancy\ninformed Somerset in answer to a cursory inquiry, that he hoped to be\nback again at the ball in half-an-hour.\n\nWhen they were gone Somerset, feeling that now another dog might have\nhis day, sounded Paula on the delightful question of a dance.\n\nPaula replied in the negative.\n\n'How is that?' asked Somerset with reproachful disappointment.\n\n'I cannot dance again,' she said in a somewhat depressed tone; 'I must\nbe released from every engagement to do so, on account of Charlotte's\nillness. I should have gone home with her if I had not been particularly\nrequested to stay a little longer, since it is as yet so early, and\nCharlotte's illness is not very serious.'\n\nIf Charlotte's illness was not very serious, Somerset thought, Paula\nmight have stretched a point; but not wishing to hinder her in showing\nrespect to a friend so well liked by himself, he did not ask it. De\nStancy had promised to be back again in half-an-hour, and Paula had\nheard the promise. But at the end of twenty minutes, still seeming\nindifferent to what was going on around her, she said she would stay no\nlonger, and reminding Somerset that they were soon to meet and talk over\nthe rebuilding, drove off with her aunt to Stancy Castle.\n\nSomerset stood looking after the retreating carriage till it was\nenveloped in shades that the lamps could not disperse. The ball-room\nwas now virtually empty for him, and feeling no great anxiety to return\nthither he stood on the steps for some minutes longer, looking into\nthe calm mild night, and at the dark houses behind whose blinds lay the\nburghers with their eyes sealed up in sleep. He could not but think that\nit was rather too bad of Paula to spoil his evening for a sentimental\ndevotion to Charlotte which could do the latter no appreciable good; and\nhe would have felt seriously hurt at her move if it had not been equally\nsevere upon Captain De Stancy, who was doubtless hastening back, full of\na belief that she would still be found there.\n\nThe star of gas-jets over the entrance threw its light upon the walls\non the opposite side of the street, where there were notice-boards of\nforthcoming events. In glancing over these for the fifth time, his eye\nwas attracted by the first words of a placard in blue letters, of a size\nlarger than the rest, and moving onward a few steps he read:--\n\n\n                    STANCY CASTLE.\n\n           By the kind permission of Miss Power,\n\n                        A PLAY\n\n       Will shortly be performed at the above CASTLE,\n\n\n               IN AID OF THE FUNDS OF THE\n\n                     COUNTY HOSPITAL,\n\n                  By the Officers of the\n\n                  ROYAL HORSE ARTILLERY,\n\n                     MARKTON BARRACKS,\n\n                    ASSISTED BY SEVERAL\n\n                LADIES OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD.\n\n  The cast and other particulars will be duly announced in\nsmall  bills.  Places will be reserved on application to Mr.\nClangham,  High Street, Markton, where a plan of the room may be seen.\n\n  N.B--The Castle is about twenty minutes' drive from Markton\nStation,  to which there are numerous convenient trains from all parts\nof the  county.\n\n\n\nIn a profound study Somerset turned and re-entered the ball-room, where\nhe remained gloomily standing here and there for about five minutes,\nat the end of which he observed Captain De Stancy, who had returned\npunctually to his word, crossing the hall in his direction.\n\nThe gallant officer darted glances of lively search over every group of\ndancers and sitters; and then with rather a blank look in his face, he\ncame on to Somerset. Replying to the latter's inquiry for his sister\nthat she had nearly recovered, he said, 'I don't see my father's\nneighbours anywhere.'\n\n'They have gone home,' replied Somerset, a trifle drily. 'They asked\nme to make their apologies to you for leading you to expect they would\nremain. Miss Power was too anxious about Miss De Stancy to care to stay\nlonger.'\n\nThe eyes of De Stancy and the speaker met for an instant. That curious\nguarded understanding, or inimical confederacy, which arises at moments\nbetween two men in love with the same woman, was present here; and in\ntheir mutual glances each said as plainly as by words that her departure\nhad ruined his evening's hope.\n\nThey were now about as much in one mood as it was possible for two such\ndiffering natures to be. Neither cared further for elaborating giddy\ncurves on that town-hall floor. They stood talking languidly about this\nand that local topic, till De Stancy turned aside for a short time to\nspeak to a dapper little lady who had beckoned to him. In a few minutes\nhe came back to Somerset.\n\n'Mrs. Camperton, the wife of Major Camperton of my battery, would very\nmuch like me to introduce you to her. She is an old friend of your\nfather's, and has wanted to know you for a long time.'\n\nDe Stancy and Somerset crossed over to the lady, and in a few minutes,\nthanks to her flow of spirits, she and Somerset were chatting with\nremarkable freedom.\n\n'It is a happy coincidence,' continued Mrs. Camperton, 'that I should\nhave met you here, immediately after receiving a letter from your\nfather: indeed it reached me only this morning. He has been so kind!\nWe are getting up some theatricals, as you know, I suppose, to help the\nfunds of the County Hospital, which is in debt.'\n\n'I have just seen the announcement--nothing more.'\n\n'Yes, such an estimable purpose; and as we wished to do it thoroughly\nwell, I asked Mr. Somerset to design us the costumes, and he has now\nsent me the sketches. It is quite a secret at present, but we are going\nto play Shakespeare's romantic drama, 'Love's Labour's Lost,' and we\nhope to get Miss Power to take the leading part. You see, being such a\nhandsome girl, and so wealthy, and rather an undiscovered novelty in the\ncounty as yet, she would draw a crowded room, and greatly benefit the\nfunds.'\n\n'Miss Power going to play herself?--I am rather surprised,' said\nSomerset. 'Whose idea is all this?'\n\n'O, Captain De Stancy's--he's the originator entirely. You see he is so\ninterested in the neighbourhood, his family having been connected with\nit for so many centuries, that naturally a charitable object of this\nlocal nature appeals to his feelings.'\n\n'Naturally!' her listener laconically repeated. 'And have you settled\nwho is to play the junior gentleman's part, leading lover, hero, or\nwhatever he is called?'\n\n'Not absolutely; though I think Captain De Stancy will not refuse it;\nand he is a very good figure. At present it lies between him and Mr.\nMild, one of our young lieutenants. My husband, of course, takes the\nheavy line; and I am to be the second lady, though I am rather too old\nfor the part really. If we can only secure Miss Power for heroine the\ncast will be excellent.'\n\n'Excellent!' said Somerset, with a spectral smile.\n\n\n\nVII.\n\nWhen he awoke the next morning at the Lord-Quantock-Arms Hotel Somerset\nfelt quite morbid on recalling the intelligence he had received from\nMrs. Camperton. But as the day for serious practical consultation about\nthe castle works, to which Paula had playfully alluded, was now close at\nhand, he determined to banish sentimental reflections on the frailties\nthat were besieging her nature, by active preparation for his\nprofessional undertaking. To be her high-priest in art, to elaborate a\nstructure whose cunning workmanship would be meeting her eye every day\ntill the end of her natural life, and saying to her, 'He invented it,'\nwith all the eloquence of an inanimate thing long regarded--this was no\nmean satisfaction, come what else would.\n\nHe returned to town the next day to set matters there in such trim that\nno inconvenience should result from his prolonged absence at the castle;\nfor having no other commission he determined (with an eye rather to\nheart-interests than to increasing his professional practice) to make,\nas before, the castle itself his office, studio, and chief abiding-place\ntill the works were fairly in progress.\n\nOn the tenth he reappeared at Markton. Passing through the town, on the\nroad to Stancy Castle, his eyes were again arrested by the notice-board\nwhich had conveyed such startling information to him on the night of the\nball. The small bills now appeared thereon; but when he anxiously looked\nthem over to learn how the parts were to be allotted, he found\nthat intelligence still withheld. Yet they told enough; the list of\nlady-players was given, and Miss Power's name was one.\n\nThat a young lady who, six months ago, would scarcely join for\nconscientious reasons in a simple dance on her own lawn, should now be\nwilling to exhibit herself on a public stage, simulating love-passages\nwith a stranger, argued a rate of development which under any\ncircumstances would have surprised him, but which, with the particular\naddition, as leading colleague, of Captain De Stancy, inflamed him\nalmost to anger. What clandestine arrangements had been going on in his\nabsence to produce such a full-blown intention it were futile to guess.\nPaula's course was a race rather than a march, and each successive heat\nwas startling in its eclipse of that which went before.\n\nSomerset was, however, introspective enough to know that his morals\nwould have taken no such virtuous alarm had he been the chief male\nplayer instead of Captain De Stancy.\n\nHe passed under the castle-arch and entered. There seemed a little turn\nin the tide of affairs when it was announced to him that Miss Power\nexpected him, and was alone.\n\nThe well-known ante-chambers through which he walked, filled with\ntwilight, draughts, and thin echoes that seemed to reverberate from two\nhundred years ago, did not delay his eye as they had done when he had\nbeen ignorant that his destiny lay beyond; and he followed on through\nall this ancientness to where the modern Paula sat to receive him.\n\nHe forgot everything in the pleasure of being alone in a room with her.\nShe met his eye with that in her own which cheered him. It was a light\nexpressing that something was understood between them. She said quietly\nin two or three words that she had expected him in the forenoon.\n\nSomerset explained that he had come only that morning from London.\n\nAfter a little more talk, in which she said that her aunt would join\nthem in a few minutes, and Miss De Stancy was still indisposed at her\nfather's house, she rang for tea and sat down beside a little table.\n\n'Shall we proceed to business at once?' she asked him.\n\n'I suppose so.'\n\n'First then, when will the working drawings be ready, which I think you\nsaid must be made out before the work could begin?'\n\nWhile Somerset informed her on this and other matters, Mrs. Goodman\nentered and joined in the discussion, after which they found it would be\nnecessary to adjourn to the room where the plans were hanging. On their\nwalk thither Paula asked if he stayed late at the ball.\n\n'I left soon after you.'\n\n'That was very early, seeing how late you arrived.'\n\n'Yes.... I did not dance.'\n\n'What did you do then?'\n\n'I moped, and walked to the door; and saw an announcement.'\n\n'I know--the play that is to be performed.'\n\n'In which you are to be the Princess.'\n\n'That's not settled,--I have not agreed yet. I shall not play the\nPrincess of France unless Mr. Mild plays the King of Navarre.'\n\nThis sounded rather well. The Princess was the lady beloved by the\nKing; and Mr. Mild, the young lieutenant of artillery, was a diffident,\ninexperienced, rather plain-looking fellow, whose sole interest in\ntheatricals lay in the consideration of his costume and the sound of\nhis own voice in the ears of the audience. With such an unobjectionable\nperson to enact the part of lover, the prominent character of leading\nyoung lady or heroine, which Paula was to personate, was really the most\nsatisfactory in the whole list for her. For although she was to be wooed\nhard, there was just as much love-making among the remaining personages;\nwhile, as Somerset had understood the play, there could occur no\nflingings of her person upon her lover's neck, or agonized downfalls\nupon the stage, in her whole performance, as there were in the parts\nchosen by Mrs. Camperton, the major's wife, and some of the other\nladies.\n\n'Why do you play at all!' he murmured.\n\n'What a question! How could I refuse for such an excellent purpose? They\nsay that my taking a part will be worth a hundred pounds to the\ncharity. My father always supported the hospital, which is quite\nundenominational; and he said I was to do the same.'\n\n'Do you think the peculiar means you have adopted for supporting it\nentered into his view?' inquired Somerset, regarding her with critical\ndryness. 'For my part I don't.'\n\n'It is an interesting way,' she returned persuasively, though apparently\nin a state of mental equipoise on the point raised by his question. 'And\nI shall not play the Princess, as I said, to any other than that quiet\nyoung man. Now I assure you of this, so don't be angry and absurd!\nBesides, the King doesn't marry me at the end of the play, as in\nShakespeare's other comedies. And if Miss De Stancy continues seriously\nunwell I shall not play at all.'\n\nThe young man pressed her hand, but she gently slipped it away.\n\n'Are we not engaged, Paula!' he asked. She evasively shook her head.\n\n'Come--yes we are! Shall we tell your aunt?' he continued. Unluckily\nat that moment Mrs. Goodman, who had followed them to the studio at a\nslower pace, appeared round the doorway.\n\n'No,--to the last,' replied Paula hastily. Then her aunt entered, and\nthe conversation was no longer personal.\n\nSomerset took his departure in a serener mood though not completely\nassured.\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\nHis serenity continued during two or three following days, when,\ncontinuing at the castle, he got pleasant glimpses of Paula now and\nthen. Her strong desire that his love for her should be kept secret,\nperplexed him; but his affection was generous, and he acquiesced in that\ndesire.\n\nMeanwhile news of the forthcoming dramatic performance radiated in every\ndirection. And in the next number of the county paper it was announced,\nto Somerset's comparative satisfaction, that the cast was definitely\nsettled, Mr. Mild having agreed to be the King and Miss Power the French\nPrincess. Captain De Stancy, with becoming modesty for one who was the\nleading spirit, figured quite low down, in the secondary character of\nSir Nathaniel.\n\nSomerset remembered that, by a happy chance, the costume he had designed\nfor Sir Nathaniel was not at all picturesque; moreover Sir Nathaniel\nscarcely came near the Princess through the whole play.\n\nEvery day after this there was coming and going to and from the castle\nof railway vans laden with canvas columns, pasteboard trees, limp\nhouse-fronts, woollen lawns, and lath balustrades. There were also\nfrequent arrivals of young ladies from neighbouring country houses, and\nwarriors from the X and Y batteries of artillery, distinguishable by\ntheir regulation shaving.\n\nBut it was upon Captain De Stancy and Mrs. Camperton that the weight\nof preparation fell. Somerset, through being much occupied in the\ndrawing-office, was seldom present during the consultations and\nrehearsals: until one day, tea being served in the drawing-room at the\nusual hour, he dropped in with the rest to receive a cup from Paula's\ntable. The chatter was tremendous, and Somerset was at once consulted\nabout some necessary carpentry which was to be specially made at\nMarkton. After that he was looked on as one of the band, which resulted\nin a large addition to the number of his acquaintance in this part of\nEngland.\n\nBut his own feeling was that of being an outsider still. This vagary\nhad been originated, the play chosen, the parts allotted, all in his\nabsence, and calling him in at the last moment might, if flirtation were\npossible in Paula, be but a sop to pacify him. What would he have given\nto impersonate her lover in the piece! But neither Paula nor any one\nelse had asked him.\n\nThe eventful evening came. Somerset had been engaged during the day with\nthe different people by whom the works were to be carried out and in the\nevening went to his rooms at the Lord-Quantock-Arms, Markton, where\nhe dined. He did not return to the castle till the hour fixed for the\nperformance, and having been received by Mrs. Goodman, entered the large\napartment, now transfigured into a theatre, like any other spectator.\n\nRumours of the projected representation had spread far and wide. Six\ntimes the number of tickets issued might have been readily sold. Friends\nand acquaintances of the actors came from curiosity to see how they\nwould acquit themselves; while other classes of people came because they\nwere eager to see well-known notabilities in unwonted situations. When\nladies, hitherto only beheld in frigid, impenetrable positions behind\ntheir coachmen in Markton High Street, were about to reveal their hidden\ntraits, home attitudes, intimate smiles, nods, and perhaps kisses, to\nthe public eye, it was a throwing open of fascinating social secrets not\nto be missed for money.\n\nThe performance opened with no further delay than was occasioned by the\ncustomary refusal of the curtain at these times to rise more than two\nfeet six inches; but this hitch was remedied, and the play began. It was\nwith no enviable emotion that Somerset, who was watching intently, saw,\nnot Mr. Mild, but Captain De Stancy, enter as the King of Navarre.\n\nSomerset as a friend of the family had had a seat reserved for him\nnext to that of Mrs. Goodman, and turning to her he said with some\nexcitement, 'I understood that Mr. Mild had agreed to take that part?'\n\n'Yes,' she said in a whisper, 'so he had; but he broke down. Luckily\nCaptain De Stancy was familiar with the part, through having coached the\nothers so persistently, and he undertook it off-hand. Being about the\nsame figure as Lieutenant Mild the same dress fits him, with a little\nalteration by the tailor.'\n\nIt did fit him indeed; and of the male costumes it was that on which\nSomerset had bestowed most pains when designing them. It shrewdly burst\nupon his mind that there might have been collusion between Mild and De\nStancy, the former agreeing to take the captain's place and act as blind\ntill the last moment. A greater question was, could Paula have been\naware of this, and would she perform as the Princess of France now De\nStancy was to be her lover?\n\n'Does Miss Power know of this change?' he inquired.\n\n'She did not till quite a short time ago.'\n\nHe controlled his impatience till the beginning of the second act. The\nPrincess entered; it was Paula. But whether the slight embarrassment\nwith which she pronounced her opening words,\n\n     'Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,\n      Needs not the painted flourish of your praise,'\n\nwas due to the newness of her situation, or to her knowledge that De\nStancy had usurped Mild's part of her lover, he could not guess. De\nStancy appeared, and Somerset felt grim as he listened to the gallant\ncaptain's salutation of the Princess, and her response.\n\n  De S.   Fair Princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.\n  Paula.  Fair, I give you back again:  and welcome, I have\nnot yet.\n\nSomerset listened to this and to all that which followed of the same\nsort, with the reflection that, after all, the Princess never throughout\nthe piece compromised her dignity by showing her love for the King; and\nthat the latter never addressed her in words in which passion got the\nbetter of courtesy. Moreover, as Paula had herself observed, they did\nnot marry at the end of the piece, as in Shakespeare's other comedies.\nSomewhat calm in this assurance, he waited on while the other couples\nrespectively indulged in their love-making, and banter, including Mrs.\nCamperton as the sprightly Rosaline. But he was doomed to be surprised\nout of his humour when the end of the act came on. In abridging the play\nfor the convenience of representation, the favours or gifts from the\ngentlemen to the ladies were personally presented: and now Somerset saw\nDe Stancy advance with the necklace fetched by Paula from London, and\nclasp it on her neck.\n\nThis seemed to throw a less pleasant light on her hasty journey. To\nfetch a valuable ornament to lend it to a poorer friend was estimable;\nbut to fetch it that the friend's brother should have something\nmagnificent to use as a lover's offering to herself in public, that\nwore a different complexion. And if the article were recognized by\nthe spectators as the same that Charlotte had worn at the ball, the\npresentation by De Stancy of what must seem to be an heirloom of his\nhouse would be read as symbolizing a union of the families.\n\nDe Stancy's mode of presenting the necklace, though unauthorized by\nShakespeare, had the full approval of the company, and set them in\ngood humour to receive Major Camperton as Armado the braggart. Nothing\ncalculated to stimulate jealousy occurred again till the fifth act; and\nthen there arose full cause for it.\n\nThe scene was the outside of the Princess's pavilion. De Stancy, as\nthe King of Navarre, stood with his group of attendants awaiting the\nPrincess, who presently entered from her door. The two began to converse\nas the play appointed, De Stancy turning to her with this reply--\n\n     'Rebuke me not for that which you provoke;\n      The virtue of your eye must break my oath.'\n\nSo far all was well; and Paula opened her lips for the set rejoinder.\nBut before she had spoken De Stancy continued--\n\n     'If I profane with my unworthy hand\n                                    (Taking her hand)\n      This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this--\n      My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand\n      To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.'\n\nSomerset stared. Surely in this comedy the King never addressed the\nPrincess in such warm words; and yet they were Shakespeare's, for they\nwere quite familiar to him. A dim suspicion crossed his mind. Mrs.\nGoodman had brought a copy of Shakespeare with her, which she kept in\nher lap and never looked at: borrowing it, Somerset turned to 'Romeo and\nJuliet,' and there he saw the words which De Stancy had introduced as\ngag, to intensify the mild love-making of the other play. Meanwhile De\nStancy continued--\n\n     'O then, dear Saint, let lips do what hands do;\n      They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.\n      Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.\n      Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purg'd!'\n\nCould it be that De Stancy was going to do what came next in the stage\ndirection--kiss her? Before there was time for conjecture on that point\nthe sound of a very sweet and long-drawn osculation spread through the\nroom, followed by loud applause from the people in the cheap seats. De\nStancy withdrew from bending over Paula, and she was very red in the\nface. Nothing seemed clearer than that he had actually done the deed.\nThe applause continuing, Somerset turned his head. Five hundred\nfaces had regarded the act, without a consciousness that it was an\ninterpolation; and four hundred and fifty mouths in those faces were\nsmiling. About one half of them were tender smiles; these came from the\nwomen. The other half were at best humorous, and mainly satirical; these\ncame from the men. It was a profanation without parallel, and his face\nblazed like a coal.\n\nThe play was now nearly at an end, and Somerset sat on, feeling what\nhe could not express. More than ever was he assured that there had been\ncollusion between the two artillery officers to bring about this end.\nThat he should have been the unhappy man to design those picturesque\ndresses in which his rival so audaciously played the lover to his,\nSomerset's, mistress, was an added point to the satire. He could\nhardly go so far as to assume that Paula was a consenting party to this\nstartling interlude; but her otherwise unaccountable wish that his own\nlove should be clandestinely shown lent immense force to a doubt of her\nsincerity. The ghastly thought that she had merely been keeping him on,\nlike a pet spaniel, to amuse her leisure moments till she should have\nfound appropriate opportunity for an open engagement with some one else,\ntrusting to his sense of chivalry to keep secret their little episode,\nfilled him with a grim heat.\n\n\n\nIX.\n\nAt the back of the room the applause had been loud at the moment of the\nkiss, real or counterfeit. The cause was partly owing to an exceptional\ncircumstance which had occurred in that quarter early in the play.\n\nThe people had all seated themselves, and the first act had begun,\nwhen the tapestry that screened the door was lifted gently and a figure\nappeared in the opening. The general attention was at this moment\nabsorbed by the newly disclosed stage, and scarcely a soul noticed the\nstranger. Had any one of the audience turned his head, there would have\nbeen sufficient in the countenance to detain his gaze, notwithstanding\nthe counter-attraction forward.\n\nHe was obviously a man who had come from afar. There was not a square\ninch about him that had anything to do with modern English life. His\nvisage, which was of the colour of light porphyry, had little of its\noriginal surface left; it was a face which had been the plaything of\nstrange fires or pestilences, that had moulded to whatever shape they\nchose his originally supple skin, and left it pitted, puckered, and\nseamed like a dried water-course. But though dire catastrophes or\nthe treacherous airs of remote climates had done their worst upon his\nexterior, they seemed to have affected him but little within, to judge\nfrom a certain robustness which showed itself in his manner of standing.\n\nThe face-marks had a meaning, for any one who could read them, beyond\nthe mere suggestion of their origin: they signified that this man\nhad either been the victim of some terrible necessity as regarded the\noccupation to which he had devoted himself, or that he was a man of\ndogged obstinacy, from sheer sang froid holding his ground amid malign\nforces when others would have fled affrighted away.\n\nAs nobody noticed him, he dropped the door hangings after a while,\nwalked silently along the matted alley, and sat down in one of the back\nchairs. His manner of entry was enough to show that the strength of\ncharacter which he seemed to possess had phlegm for its base and not\nardour. One might have said that perhaps the shocks he had passed\nthrough had taken all his original warmth out of him. His beaver hat,\nwhich he had retained on his head till this moment, he now placed under\nthe seat, where he sat absolutely motionless till the end of the first\nact, as if he were indulging in a monologue which did not quite reach\nhis lips.\n\nWhen Paula entered at the beginning of the second act he showed as much\nexcitement as was expressed by a slight movement of the eyes. When she\nspoke he turned to his next neighbour, and asked him in cold level words\nwhich had once been English, but which seemed to have lost the accent\nof nationality: 'Is that the young woman who is the possessor of this\ncastle--Power by name?'\n\nHis neighbour happened to be the landlord at Sleeping-Green, and he\ninformed the stranger that she was what he supposed.\n\n'And who is that gentleman whose line of business seems to be to make\nlove to Power?'\n\n'He's Captain De Stancy, Sir William De Stancy's son, who used to own\nthis property.'\n\n'Baronet or knight?'\n\n'Baronet--a very old-established family about here.'\n\nThe stranger nodded, and the play went on, no further word being spoken\ntill the fourth act was reached, when the stranger again said, without\ntaking his narrow black eyes from the stage: 'There's something in that\nlove-making between Stancy and Power that's not all sham!'\n\n'Well,' said the landlord, 'I have heard different stories about that,\nand wouldn't be the man to zay what I couldn't swear to. The story is\nthat Captain De Stancy, who is as poor as a gallicrow, is in full cry\na'ter her, and that his on'y chance lies in his being heir to a title\nand the wold name. But she has not shown a genuine hanker for anybody\nyet.'\n\n'If she finds the money, and this Stancy finds the name and blood,\n'twould be a very neat match between 'em,--hey?'\n\n'That's the argument.'\n\nNothing more was said again for a long time, but the stranger's eyes\nshowed more interest in the passes between Paula and De Stancy than they\nhad shown before. At length the crisis came, as described in the last\nchapter, De Stancy saluting her with that semblance of a kiss which gave\nsuch umbrage to Somerset. The stranger's thin lips lengthened a couple\nof inches with satisfaction; he put his hand into his pocket, drew out\ntwo half-crowns which he handed to the landlord, saying, 'Just applaud\nthat, will you, and get your comrades to do the same.'\n\nThe landlord, though a little surprised, took the money, and began to\nclap his hands as desired. The example was contagious, and spread all\nover the room; for the audience, gentle and simple, though they might\nnot have followed the blank verse in all its bearings, could at least\nappreciate a kiss. It was the unusual acclamation raised by this means\nwhich had led Somerset to turn his head.\n\nWhen the play had ended the stranger was the first to rise, and going\ndownstairs at the head of the crowd he passed out of doors, and was lost\nto view. Some questions were asked by the landlord as to the stranger's\nindividuality; but few had seen him; fewer had noticed him, singular as\nhe was; and none knew his name.\n\nWhile these things had been going on in the quarter allotted to the\ncommonalty, Somerset in front had waited the fall of the curtain with\nthose sick and sorry feelings which should be combated by the aid of\nphilosophy and a good conscience, but which really are only subdued by\ntime and the abrading rush of affairs. He was, however, stoical enough,\nwhen it was all over, to accept Mrs. Goodman's invitation to accompany\nher to the drawing-room, fully expecting to find there a large company,\nincluding Captain De Stancy.\n\nBut none of the acting ladies and gentlemen had emerged from their\ndressing-rooms as yet. Feeling that he did not care to meet any of them\nthat night, he bade farewell to Mrs. Goodman after a few minutes of\nconversation, and left her. While he was passing along the corridor,\nat the side of the gallery which had been used as the theatre, Paula\ncrossed it from the latter apartment towards an opposite door. She was\nstill in the dress of the Princess, and the diamond and pearl necklace\nstill hung over her bosom as placed there by Captain De Stancy.\n\nHer eye caught Somerset's, and she stopped. Probably there was something\nin his face which told his mind, for she invited him by a smile into the\nroom she was entering.\n\n'I congratulate you on your performance,' he said mechanically, when she\npushed to the door.\n\n'Do you really think it was well done?' She drew near him with a\nsociable air.\n\n'It was startlingly done--the part from \"Romeo and Juliet\" pre-eminently\nso.'\n\n'Do you think I knew he was going to introduce it, or do you think I\ndidn't know?' she said, with that gentle sauciness which shows itself in\nthe loved one's manner when she has had a triumphant evening without the\nlover's assistance.\n\n'I think you may have known.'\n\n'No,' she averred, decisively shaking her head. 'It took me as much by\nsurprise as it probably did you. But why should I have told!'\n\nWithout answering that question Somerset went on. 'Then what he did at\nthe end of his gag was of course a surprise also.'\n\n'He didn't really do what he seemed to do,' she serenely answered.\n\n'Well, I have no right to make observations--your actions are not\nsubject to my surveillance; you float above my plane,' said the young\nman with some bitterness. 'But to speak plainly, surely he--kissed you?'\n\n'No,' she said. 'He only kissed the air in front of me--ever so far\noff.'\n\n'Was it six inches off?'\n\n'No, not six inches.'\n\n'Nor three.'\n\n'It was quite one,' she said with an ingenuous air.\n\n'I don't call that very far.'\n\n'A miss is as good as a mile, says the time-honoured proverb; and it is\nnot for us modern mortals to question its truth.'\n\n'How can you be so off-hand?' broke out Somerset. 'I love you wildly and\ndesperately, Paula, and you know it well!'\n\n'I have never denied knowing it,' she said softly.\n\n'Then why do you, with such knowledge, adopt an air of levity at such a\nmoment as this! You keep me at arm's-length, and won't say whether you\ncare for me one bit, or no. I have owned all to you; yet never once have\nyou owned anything to me!'\n\n'I have owned much. And you do me wrong if you consider that I show\nlevity. But even if I had not owned everything, and you all, it is not\naltogether such a grievous thing.'\n\n'You mean to say that it is not grievous, even if a man does love a\nwoman, and suffers all the pain of feeling he loves in vain? Well, I say\nit is quite the reverse, and I have grounds for knowing.'\n\n'Now, don't fume so, George Somerset, but hear me. My not owning all\nmay not have the dreadful meaning you think, and therefore it may not\nbe really such a grievous thing. There are genuine reasons for women's\nconduct in these matters as well as for men's, though it is sometimes\nsupposed to be regulated entirely by caprice. And if I do not give way\nto every feeling--I mean demonstration--it is because I don't want to.\nThere now, you know what that implies; and be content.'\n\n'Very well,' said Somerset, with repressed sadness, 'I will not expect\nyou to say more. But you do like me a little, Paula?'\n\n'Now!' she said, shaking her head with symptoms of tenderness and\nlooking into his eyes. 'What have you just promised? Perhaps I like you\na little more than a little, which is much too much! Yes,--Shakespeare\nsays so, and he is always right. Do you still doubt me? Ah, I see you\ndo!'\n\n'Because somebody has stood nearer to you to-night than I.'\n\n'A fogy like him!--half as old again as either of us! How can you mind\nhim? What shall I do to show you that I do not for a moment let him come\nbetween me and you?'\n\n'It is not for me to suggest what you should do. Though what you should\npermit ME to do is obvious enough.'\n\nShe dropped her voice: 'You mean, permit you to do really and in earnest\nwhat he only seemed to do in the play.'\n\nSomerset signified by a look that such had been his thought.\n\nPaula was silent. 'No,' she murmured at last. 'That cannot be. He did\nnot, nor must you.'\n\nIt was said none the less decidedly for being spoken low.\n\n'You quite resent such a suggestion: you have a right to. I beg your\npardon, not for speaking of it, but for thinking it.'\n\n'I don't resent it at all, and I am not offended one bit. But I am not\nthe less of opinion that it is possible to be premature in some things;\nand to do this just now would be premature. I know what you would\nsay--that you would not have asked it, but for that unfortunate\nimprovisation of it in the play. But that I was not responsible for, and\ntherefore owe no reparation to you now.... Listen!'\n\n'Paula--Paula! Where in the world are you?' was heard resounding along\nthe corridor in the voice of her aunt. 'Our friends are all ready to\nleave, and you will surely bid them good-night!'\n\n'I must be gone--I won't ring for you to be shown out--come this way.'\n\n'But how will you get on in repeating the play tomorrow evening if that\ninterpolation is against your wish?' he asked, looking her hard in the\nface.\n\n'I'll think it over during the night. Come to-morrow morning to help me\nsettle. But,' she added, with coy yet genial independence, 'listen to\nme. Not a word more about a--what you asked for, mind! I don't want to\ngo so far, and I will not--not just yet anyhow--I mean perhaps never.\nYou must promise that, or I cannot see you again alone.'\n\n'It shall be as you request.'\n\n'Very well. And not a word of this to a soul. My aunt suspects: but she\nis a good aunt and will say nothing. Now that is clearly understood, I\nshould be glad to consult with you tomorrow early. I will come to you in\nthe studio or Pleasance as soon as I am disengaged.'\n\nShe took him to a little chamfered doorway in the corner, which opened\ninto a descending turret; and Somerset went down. When he had unfastened\nthe door at the bottom, and stepped into the lower corridor, she asked,\n'Are you down?' And on receiving an affirmative reply she closed the top\ndoor.\n\n\n\nX.\n\nSomerset was in the studio the next morning about ten o'clock\nsuperintending the labours of Knowles, Bowles, and Cockton, whom he\nhad again engaged to assist him with the drawings on his appointment\nto carry out the works. When he had set them going he ascended the\nstaircase of the great tower for some purpose that bore upon the\nforthcoming repairs of this part. Passing the door of the telegraph-room\nhe heard little sounds from the instrument, which somebody was working.\nOnly two people in the castle, to the best of his knowledge, knew the\ntrick of this; Miss Power, and a page in her service called John. Miss\nDe Stancy could also despatch messages, but she was at Myrtle Villa.\n\nThe door was closed, and much as he would have liked to enter, the\npossibility that Paula was not the performer led him to withhold his\nsteps. He went on to where the uppermost masonry had resisted the mighty\nhostility of the elements for five hundred years without receiving worse\ndilapidation than half-a-century produces upon the face of man. But he\nstill wondered who was telegraphing, and whether the message bore on\nhousekeeping, architecture, theatricals, or love.\n\nCould Somerset have seen through the panels of the door in passing, he\nwould have beheld the room occupied by Paula alone.\n\nIt was she who sat at the instrument, and the message she was\ndespatching ran as under:--\n\n'Can you send down a competent actress, who will undertake the part of\nPrincess of France in \"Love's Labour's Lost\" this evening in a temporary\ntheatre here? Dresses already provided suitable to a lady about the\nmiddle height. State price.'\n\nThe telegram was addressed to a well-known theatrical agent in London.\n\nOff went the message, and Paula retired into the next room, leaving the\ndoor open between that and the one she had just quitted. Here she\nbusied herself with writing some letters, till in less than an hour the\ntelegraph instrument showed signs of life, and she hastened back to its\nside. The reply received from the agent was as follows:--\n\n'Miss Barbara Bell of the Regent's Theatre could come. Quite competent.\nHer terms would be about twenty-five guineas.'\n\nWithout a moment's pause Paula returned for answer:--\n\n'The terms are quite satisfactory.'\n\nPresently she heard the instrument again, and emerging from the next\nroom in which she had passed the intervening time as before, she read:--\n\n'Miss Barbara Bell's terms were accidentally understated. They would be\nforty guineas, in consequence of the distance. Am waiting at the office\nfor a reply.'\n\nPaula set to work as before and replied:--\n\n'Quite satisfactory; only let her come at once.'\n\nShe did not leave the room this time, but went to an arrow-slit hard\nby and gazed out at the trees till the instrument began to speak again.\nReturning to it with a leisurely manner, implying a full persuasion that\nthe matter was settled, she was somewhat surprised to learn that,\n\n'Miss Bell, in stating her terms, understands that she will not be\nrequired to leave London till the middle of the afternoon. If it\nis necessary for her to leave at once, ten guineas extra would be\nindispensable, on account of the great inconvenience of such a short\nnotice.'\n\nPaula seemed a little vexed, but not much concerned she sent back with a\nreadiness scarcely politic in the circumstances:--\n\n'She must start at once. Price agreed to.'\n\nHer impatience for the answer was mixed with curiosity as to whether it\nwas due to the agent or to Miss Barbara Bell that the prices had grown\nlike Jack's Bean-stalk in the negotiation. Another telegram duly came:--\n\n'Travelling expenses are expected to be paid.'\n\nWith decided impatience she dashed off:--\n\n'Of course; but nothing more will be agreed to.'\n\nThen, and only then, came the desired reply:--\n\n'Miss Bell starts by the twelve o'clock train.'\n\nThis business being finished, Paula left the chamber and descended into\nthe inclosure called the Pleasance, a spot grassed down like a lawn.\nHere stood Somerset, who, having come down from the tower, was looking\non while a man searched for old foundations under the sod with a\ncrowbar. He was glad to see her at last, and noticed that she looked\nserene and relieved; but could not for the moment divine the cause.\nPaula came nearer, returned his salutation, and regarded the man's\noperations in silence awhile till his work led him to a distance from\nthem.\n\n'Do you still wish to consult me?' asked Somerset.\n\n'About the building perhaps,' said she. 'Not about the play.'\n\n'But you said so?'\n\n'Yes; but it will be unnecessary.'\n\nSomerset thought this meant skittishness, and merely bowed.\n\n'You mistake me as usual,' she said, in a low tone. 'I am not going to\nconsult you on that matter, because I have done all you could have asked\nfor without consulting you. I take no part in the play to-night.'\n\n'Forgive my momentary doubt!'\n\n'Somebody else will play for me--an actress from London. But on no\naccount must the substitution be known beforehand or the performance\nto-night will never come off: and that I should much regret.'\n\n'Captain De Stancy will not play his part if he knows you will not play\nyours--that's what you mean?'\n\n'You may suppose it is,' she said, smiling. 'And to guard against this\nyou must help me to keep the secret by being my confederate.'\n\nTo be Paula's confederate; to-day, indeed, time had brought him\nsomething worth waiting for. 'In anything!' cried Somerset.\n\n'Only in this!' said she, with soft severity. 'And you know what you\nhave promised, George! And you remember there is to be no--what we\ntalked about! Now will you go in the one-horse brougham to Markton\nStation this afternoon, and meet the four o'clock train? Inquire for a\nlady for Stancy Castle--a Miss Bell; see her safely into the carriage,\nand send her straight on here. I am particularly anxious that she should\nnot enter the town, for I think she once came to Markton in a starring\ncompany, and she might be recognized, and my plan be defeated.'\n\nThus she instructed her lover and devoted friend; and when he could stay\nno longer he left her in the garden to return to his studio. As Somerset\nwent in by the garden door he met a strange-looking personage coming out\nby the same passage--a stranger, with the manner of a Dutchman, the face\nof a smelter, and the clothes of an inhabitant of Guiana. The stranger,\nwhom we have already seen sitting at the back of the theatre the night\nbefore, looked hard from Somerset to Paula, and from Paula again to\nSomerset, as he stepped out. Somerset had an unpleasant conviction that\nthis queer gentleman had been standing for some time in the doorway\nunnoticed, quizzing him and his mistress as they talked together. If so\nhe might have learnt a secret.\n\nWhen he arrived upstairs, Somerset went to a window commanding a view\nof the garden. Paula still stood in her place, and the stranger was\nearnestly conversing with her. Soon they passed round the corner and\ndisappeared.\n\nIt was now time for him to see about starting for Markton, an\nintelligible zest for circumventing the ardent and coercive captain of\nartillery saving him from any unnecessary delay in the journey. He was\nat the station ten minutes before the train was due; and when it drew\nup to the platform the first person to jump out was Captain De Stancy in\nsportsman's attire and with a gun in his hand. Somerset nodded, and De\nStancy spoke, informing the architect that he had been ten miles up the\nline shooting waterfowl. 'That's Miss Power's carriage, I think,' he\nadded.\n\n'Yes,' said Somerset carelessly. 'She expects a friend, I believe. We\nshall see you at the castle again to-night?'\n\nDe Stancy assured him that they would, and the two men parted, Captain\nDe Stancy, when he had glanced to see that the carriage was empty, going\non to where a porter stood with a couple of spaniels.\n\nSomerset now looked again to the train. While his back had been turned\nto converse with the captain, a lady of five-and-thirty had alighted\nfrom the identical compartment occupied by De Stancy. She made an\ninquiry about getting to Stancy Castle, upon which Somerset, who had not\ntill now observed her, went forward, and introducing himself assisted\nher to the carriage and saw her safely off.\n\nDe Stancy had by this time disappeared, and Somerset walked on to his\nrooms at the Lord-Quantock-Arms, where he remained till he had dined,\npicturing the discomfiture of his alert rival when there should enter to\nhim as Princess, not Paula Power, but Miss Bell of the Regent's Theatre,\nLondon. Thus the hour passed, till he found that if he meant to see the\nissue of the plot it was time to be off.\n\nOn arriving at the castle, Somerset entered by the public door from the\nhall as before, a natural delicacy leading him to feel that though he\nmight be welcomed as an ally at the stage-door--in other words, the door\nfrom the corridor--it was advisable not to take too ready an advantage\nof a privilege which, in the existing secrecy of his understanding with\nPaula, might lead to an overthrow of her plans on that point.\n\nNot intending to sit out the whole performance, Somerset contented\nhimself with standing in a window recess near the proscenium, whence he\ncould observe both the stage and the front rows of spectators. He was\nquite uncertain whether Paula would appear among the audience to-night,\nand resolved to wait events. Just before the rise of the curtain the\nyoung lady in question entered and sat down. When the scenery was\ndisclosed and the King of Navarre appeared, what was Somerset's surprise\nto find that, though the part was the part taken by De Stancy on the\nprevious night, the voice was that of Mr. Mild; to him, at the appointed\nseason, entered the Princess, namely, Miss Barbara Bell.\n\nBefore Somerset had recovered from his crestfallen sensation at De\nStancy's elusiveness, that officer himself emerged in evening dress from\nbehind a curtain forming a wing to the proscenium, and Somerset remarked\nthat the minor part originally allotted to him was filled by the\nsubaltern who had enacted it the night before. De Stancy glanced across,\nwhether by accident or otherwise Somerset could not determine, and his\nglance seemed to say he quite recognized there had been a trial of wits\nbetween them, and that, thanks to his chance meeting with Miss Bell in\nthe train, his had proved the stronger.\n\nThe house being less crowded to-night there were one or two vacant\nchairs in the best part. De Stancy, advancing from where he had stood\nfor a few moments, seated himself comfortably beside Miss Power.\n\nOn the other side of her he now perceived the same queer elderly\nforeigner (as he appeared) who had come to her in the garden that\nmorning. Somerset was surprised to perceive also that Paula with\nvery little hesitation introduced him and De Stancy to each other. A\nconversation ensued between the three, none the less animated for being\ncarried on in a whisper, in which Paula seemed on strangely intimate\nterms with the stranger, and the stranger to show feelings of\ngreat friendship for De Stancy, considering that they must be new\nacquaintances.\n\nThe play proceeded, and Somerset still lingered in his corner. He could\nnot help fancying that De Stancy's ingenious relinquishment of his part,\nand its obvious reason, was winning Paula's admiration. His conduct was\nhomage carried to unscrupulous and inconvenient lengths, a sort of thing\nwhich a woman may chide, but which she can never resent. Who could\ndo otherwise than talk kindly to a man, incline a little to him, and\ncondone his fault, when the sole motive of so audacious an exercise of\nhis wits was to escape acting with any other heroine than herself.\n\nHis conjectures were brought to a pause by the ending of the comedy, and\nthe opportunity afforded him of joining the group in front. The mass of\npeople were soon gone, and the knot of friends assembled around Paula\nwere discussing the merits and faults of the two days' performance.\n\n'My uncle, Mr. Abner Power,' said Paula suddenly to Somerset, as he came\nnear, presenting the stranger to the astonished young man. 'I could not\nsee you before the performance, as I should have liked to do. The return\nof my uncle is so extraordinary that it ought to be told in a less\nhurried way than this. He has been supposed dead by all of us for nearly\nten years--ever since the time we last heard from him.'\n\n'For which I am to blame,' said Mr. Power, nodding to Paula's architect.\n'Yet not I, but accident and a sluggish temperament. There are times,\nMr Somerset, when the human creature feels no interest in his kind,\nand assumes that his kind feels no interest in him. The feeling is not\nactive enough to make him fly from their presence; but sufficient to\nkeep him silent if he happens to be away. I may not have described it\nprecisely; but this I know, that after my long illness, and the fancied\nneglect of my letters--'\n\n'For which my father was not to blame, since he did not receive them,'\nsaid Paula.\n\n'For which nobody was to blame--after that, I say, I wrote no more.'\n\n'You have much pleasure in returning at last, no doubt,' said Somerset.\n\n'Sir, as I remained away without particular pain, so I return without\nparticular joy. I speak the truth, and no compliments. I may add that\nthere is one exception to this absence of feeling from my heart, namely,\nthat I do derive great satisfaction from seeing how mightily this young\nwoman has grown and prevailed.'\n\nThis address, though delivered nominally to Somerset, was listened to by\nPaula, Mrs. Goodman, and De Stancy also. After uttering it, the speaker\nturned away, and continued his previous conversation with Captain\nDe Stancy. From this time till the group parted he never again spoke\ndirectly to Somerset, paying him barely so much attention as he might\nhave expected as Paula's architect, and certainly less than he might\nhave supposed his due as her accepted lover.\n\nThe result of the appearance, as from the tomb, of this wintry man was\nthat the evening ended in a frigid and formal way which gave little\nsatisfaction to the sensitive Somerset, who was abstracted and\nconstrained by reason of thoughts on how this resuscitation of the uncle\nwould affect his relation with Paula. It was possibly also the thought\nof two at least of the others. There had, in truth, scarcely yet been\ntime enough to adumbrate the possibilities opened up by this gentleman's\nreturn.\n\nThe only private word exchanged by Somerset with any one that night was\nwith Mrs. Goodman, in whom he always recognized a friend to his cause,\nthough the fluidity of her character rendered her but a feeble one at\nthe best of times. She informed him that Mr. Power had no sort of legal\ncontrol over Paula, or direction in her estates; but Somerset could not\ndoubt that a near and only blood relation, even had he possessed but\nhalf the static force of character that made itself apparent in Mr.\nPower, might exercise considerable moral influence over the girl if\nhe chose. And in view of Mr. Power's marked preference for De Stancy,\nSomerset had many misgivings as to its operating in a direction\nfavourable to himself.\n\n\n\nXI.\n\nSomerset was deeply engaged with his draughtsmen and builders during\nthe three following days, and scarcely entered the occupied wing of the\ncastle.\n\nAt his suggestion Paula had agreed to have the works executed as\nsuch operations were carried out in old times, before the advent of\ncontractors. Each trade required in the building was to be represented\nby a master-tradesman of that denomination, who should stand responsible\nfor his own section of labour, and for no other, Somerset himself as\nchief technicist working out his designs on the spot. By this means the\nthoroughness of the workmanship would be greatly increased in comparison\nwith the modern arrangement, whereby a nominal builder, seldom present,\nwho can certainly know no more than one trade intimately and well, and\nwho often does not know that, undertakes the whole.\n\nBut notwithstanding its manifest advantages to the proprietor, the plan\nadded largely to the responsibilities of the architect, who, with\nhis master-mason, master-carpenter, master-plumber, and what not, had\nscarcely a moment to call his own. Still, the method being upon the face\nof it the true one, Somerset supervised with a will.\n\nBut there seemed to float across the court to him from the inhabited\nwing an intimation that things were not as they had been before; that\nan influence adverse to himself was at work behind the ashlared face of\ninner wall which confronted him. Perhaps this was because he never saw\nPaula at the windows, or heard her footfall in that half of the building\ngiven over to himself and his myrmidons. There was really no reason\nother than a sentimental one why he should see her. The uninhabited\npart of the castle was almost an independent structure, and it was quite\nnatural to exist for weeks in this wing without coming in contact with\nresidents in the other.\n\nA more pronounced cause than vague surmise was destined to perturb\nhim, and this in an unexpected manner. It happened one morning that he\nglanced through a local paper while waiting at the Lord-Quantock-Arms\nfor the pony-carriage to be brought round in which he often drove to the\ncastle. The paper was two days old, but to his unutterable amazement he\nread therein a paragraph which ran as follows:--\n\n'We are informed that a marriage is likely to be arranged between\nCaptain De Stancy, of the Royal Horse Artillery, only surviving son of\nSir William De Stancy, Baronet, and Paula, only daughter of the late\nJohn Power, Esq., M.P., of Stancy Castle.'\n\nSomerset dropped the paper, and stared out of the window. Fortunately\nfor his emotions, the horse and carriage were at this moment brought to\nthe door, so that nothing hindered Somerset in driving off to the spot\nat which he would be soonest likely to learn what truth or otherwise\nthere was in the newspaper report. From the first he doubted it: and\nyet how should it have got there? Such strange rumours, like paradoxical\nmaxims, generally include a portion of truth. Five days had elapsed\nsince he last spoke to Paula.\n\nReaching the castle he entered his own quarters as usual, and after\nsetting the draughtsmen to work walked up and down pondering how he\nmight best see her without making the paragraph the ground of his\nrequest for an interview; for if it were a fabrication, such a reason\nwould wound her pride in her own honour towards him, and if it were\npartly true, he would certainly do better in leaving her alone than in\nreproaching her. It would simply amount to a proof that Paula was an\narrant coquette.\n\nIn his meditation he stood still, closely scanning one of the\njamb-stones of a doorless entrance, as if to discover where the old\nhinge-hook had entered the stonework. He heard a footstep behind him,\nand looking round saw Paula standing by. She held a newspaper in her\nhand. The spot was one quite hemmed in from observation, a fact of which\nshe seemed to be quite aware.\n\n'I have something to tell you,' she said; 'something important. But you\nare so occupied with that old stone that I am obliged to wait.'\n\n'It is not true surely!' he said, looking at the paper.\n\n'No, look here,' she said, holding up the sheet. It was not what he had\nsupposed, but a new one--the local rival to that which had contained\nthe announcement, and was still damp from the press. She pointed, and he\nread--\n\n'We are authorized to state that there is no foundation whatever for the\nassertion of our contemporary that a marriage is likely to be arranged\nbetween Captain De Stancy and Miss Power of Stancy Castle.'\n\nSomerset pressed her hand. 'It disturbed me,' he said, 'though I did not\nbelieve it.'\n\n'It astonished me, as much as it disturbed you; and I sent this\ncontradiction at once.'\n\n'How could it have got there?'\n\nShe shook her head.\n\n'You have not the least knowledge?'\n\n'Not the least. I wish I had.'\n\n'It was not from any friends of De Stancy's? or himself?'\n\n'It was not. His sister has ascertained beyond doubt that he knew\nnothing of it. Well, now, don't say any more to me about the matter.'\n\n'I'll find out how it got into the paper.'\n\n'Not now--any future time will do. I have something else to tell you.'\n\n'I hope the news is as good as the last,' he said, looking into her face\nwith anxiety; for though that face was blooming, it seemed full of a\ndoubt as to how her next information would be taken.\n\n'O yes; it is good, because everybody says so. We are going to take a\ndelightful journey. My new-created uncle, as he seems, and I, and my\naunt, and perhaps Charlotte, if she is well enough, are going to Nice,\nand other places about there.'\n\n'To Nice!' said Somerset, rather blankly. 'And I must stay here?'\n\n'Why, of course you must, considering what you have undertaken!' she\nsaid, looking with saucy composure into his eyes. 'My uncle's reason for\nproposing the journey just now is, that he thinks the alterations\nwill make residence here dusty and disagreeable during the spring. The\nopportunity of going with him is too good a one for us to lose, as I\nhave never been there.'\n\n'I wish I was going to be one of the party!... What do YOU wish about\nit?'\n\nShe shook her head impenetrably. 'A woman may wish some things she does\nnot care to tell!'\n\n'Are you really glad you are going, dearest?--as I MUST call you just\nonce,' said the young man, gazing earnestly into her face, which struck\nhim as looking far too rosy and radiant to be consistent with ever so\nlittle regret at leaving him behind.\n\n'I take great interest in foreign trips, especially to the shores of\nthe Mediterranean: and everybody makes a point of getting away when the\nhouse is turned out of the window.'\n\n'But you do feel a little sadness, such as I should feel if our\npositions were reversed?'\n\n'I think you ought not to have asked that so incredulously,' she\nmurmured. 'We can be near each other in spirit, when our bodies are far\napart, can we not?' Her tone grew softer and she drew a little closer to\nhis side with a slightly nestling motion, as she went on, 'May I be sure\nthat you will not think unkindly of me when I am absent from your sight,\nand not begrudge me any little pleasure because you are not there to\nshare it with me?'\n\n'May you! Can you ask it?... As for me, I shall have no pleasure to be\nbegrudged or otherwise. The only pleasure I have is, as you well know,\nin you. When you are with me, I am happy: when you are away, I take no\npleasure in anything.'\n\n'I don't deserve it. I have no right to disturb you so,' she said, very\ngently. 'But I have given you some pleasure, have I not? A little more\npleasure than pain, perhaps?'\n\n'You have, and yet.... But I don't accuse you, dearest. Yes, you have\ngiven me pleasure. One truly pleasant time was when we stood together\nin the summer-house on the evening of the garden-party, and you said you\nliked me to love you.'\n\n'Yes, it was a pleasant time,' she returned thoughtfully. 'How the rain\ncame down, and formed a gauze between us and the dancers, did it not;\nand how afraid we were--at least I was--lest anybody should discover us\nthere, and how quickly I ran in after the rain was over!'\n\n'Yes', said Somerset, 'I remember it. But no harm came of it to you....\nAnd perhaps no good will come of it to me.'\n\n'Do not be premature in your conclusions, sir,' she said archly. 'If you\nreally do feel for me only half what you say, we shall--you will make\ngood come of it--in some way or other.'\n\n'Dear Paula--now I believe you, and can bear anything.'\n\n'Then we will say no more; because, as you recollect, we agreed not to\ngo too far. No expostulations, for we are going to be practical young\npeople; besides, I won't listen if you utter them. I simply echo your\nwords, and say I, too, believe you. Now I must go. Have faith in me, and\ndon't magnify trifles light as air.'\n\n'I THINK I understand you. And if I do, it will make a great difference\nin my conduct. You will have no cause to complain.'\n\n'Then you must not understand me so much as to make much difference; for\nyour conduct as my architect is perfect. But I must not linger longer,\nthough I wished you to know this news from my very own lips.'\n\n'Bless you for it! When do you leave?'\n\n'The day after to-morrow.'\n\n'So early? Does your uncle guess anything? Do you wish him to be told\njust yet?'\n\n'Yes, to the first; no, to the second.'\n\n'I may write to you?'\n\n'On business, yes. It will be necessary.'\n\n'How can you speak so at a time of parting?'\n\n'Now, George--you see I say George, and not Mr. Somerset, and you may\ndraw your own inference--don't be so morbid in your reproaches! I have\ninformed you that you may write, or still better, telegraph, since the\nwire is so handy--on business. Well, of course, it is for you to judge\nwhether you will add postscripts of another sort. There, you make me\nsay more than a woman ought, because you are so obtuse and literal. Good\nafternoon--good-bye! This will be my address.'\n\nShe handed him a slip of paper, and flitted away.\n\nThough he saw her again after this, it was during the bustle of\npreparation, when there was always a third person present, usually in\nthe shape of that breathing refrigerator, her uncle. Hence the few\nwords that passed between them were of the most formal description, and\nchiefly concerned the restoration of the castle, and a church at Nice\ndesigned by him, which he wanted her to inspect.\n\nThey were to leave by an early afternoon train, and Somerset was invited\nto lunch on that day. The morning was occupied by a long business\nconsultation in the studio with Mr. Power and Mrs. Goodman on what rooms\nwere to be left locked up, what left in charge of the servants, and\nwhat thrown open to the builders and workmen under the surveillance of\nSomerset. At present the work consisted mostly of repairs to existing\nrooms, so as to render those habitable which had long been used only as\nstores for lumber. Paula did not appear during this discussion; but\nwhen they were all seated in the dining-hall she came in dressed for\nthe journey, and, to outward appearance, with blithe anticipation at\nits prospect blooming from every feature. Next to her came Charlotte\nDe Stancy, still with some of the pallor of an invalid, but wonderfully\nbrightened up, as Somerset thought, by the prospect of a visit to a\ndelightful shore. It might have been this; and it might have been that\nSomerset's presence had a share in the change.\n\nIt was in the hall, when they were in the bustle of leave-taking, that\nthere occurred the only opportunity for the two or three private words\nwith Paula to which his star treated him on that last day. His took the\nhasty form of, 'You will write soon?'\n\n'Telegraphing will be quicker,' she answered in the same low tone; and\nwhispering 'Be true to me!' turned away.\n\nHow unreasonable he was! In addition to those words, warm as they were,\nhe would have preferred a little paleness of cheek, or trembling of\nlip, instead of the bloom and the beauty which sat upon her undisturbed\nmaidenhood, to tell him that in some slight way she suffered at his\nloss.\n\nImmediately after this they went to the carriages waiting at the door.\nSomerset, who had in a measure taken charge of the castle, accompanied\nthem and saw them off, much as if they were his visitors. She stepped\nin, a general adieu was spoken, and she was gone.\n\nWhile the carriages rolled away, he ascended to the top of the tower,\nwhere he saw them lessen to spots on the road, and turn the corner out\nof sight. The chances of a rival seemed to grow in proportion as Paula\nreceded from his side; but he could not have answered why. He had bidden\nher and her relatives adieu on her own doorstep, like a privileged\nfriend of the family, while De Stancy had scarcely seen her since the\nplay-night. That the silence into which the captain appeared to have\nsunk was the placidity of conscious power, was scarcely probable; yet\nthat adventitious aids existed for De Stancy he could not deny. The link\nformed by Charlotte between De Stancy and Paula, much as he liked the\ningenuous girl, was one that he could have wished away. It constituted a\nbridge of access to Paula's inner life and feelings which nothing could\nrival; except that one fact which, as he firmly believed, did actually\nrival it, giving him faith and hope; his own primary occupation of\nPaula's heart. Moreover, Mrs. Goodman would be an influence favourable\nto himself and his cause during the journey; though, to be sure, to set\nagainst her there was the phlegmatic and obstinate Abner Power, in whom,\napprised by those subtle media of intelligence which lovers possess, he\nfancied he saw no friend.\n\nSomerset remained but a short time at the castle that day. The light\nof its chambers had fled, the gross grandeur of the dictatorial towers\noppressed him, and the studio was hateful. He remembered a promise made\nlong ago to Mr. Woodwell of calling upon him some afternoon; and a\nvisit which had not much attractiveness in it at other times recommended\nitself now, through being the one possible way open to him of hearing\nPaula named and her doings talked of. Hence in walking back to\nMarkton, instead of going up the High Street, he turned aside into the\nunfrequented footway that led to the minister's cottage.\n\nMr. Woodwell was not indoors at the moment of his call, and Somerset\nlingered at the doorway, and cast his eyes around. It was a house which\ntypified the drearier tenets of its occupier with great exactness.\nIt stood upon its spot of earth without any natural union with it: no\nmosses disguised the stiff straight line where wall met earth; not\na creeper softened the aspect of the bare front. The garden walk was\nstrewn with loose clinkers from the neighbouring foundry, which rolled\nunder the pedestrian's foot and jolted his soul out of him before he\nreached the porchless door. But all was clean, and clear, and dry.\n\nWhether Mr. Woodwell was personally responsible for this condition of\nthings there was not time to closely consider, for Somerset perceived\nthe minister coming up the walk towards him. Mr. Woodwell welcomed\nhim heartily; and yet with the mien of a man whose mind has scarcely\ndismissed some scene which has preceded the one that confronts him. What\nthat scene was soon transpired.\n\n'I have had a busy afternoon,' said the minister, as they walked\nindoors; 'or rather an exciting afternoon. Your client at Stancy Castle,\nwhose uncle, as I imagine you know, has so unexpectedly returned, has\nleft with him to-day for the south of France; and I wished to ask her\nbefore her departure some questions as to how a charity organized by\nher father was to be administered in her absence. But I have been very\nunfortunate. She could not find time to see me at her own house, and I\nawaited her at the station, all to no purpose, owing to the presence of\nher friends. Well, well, I must see if a letter will find her.'\n\nSomerset asked if anybody of the neighbourhood was there to see them\noff.\n\n'Yes, that was the trouble of it. Captain De Stancy was there, and quite\nmonopolized her. I don't know what 'tis coming to, and perhaps I have no\nbusiness to inquire, since she is scarcely a member of our church now.\nWho could have anticipated the daughter of my old friend John Power\ndeveloping into the ordinary gay woman of the world as she has done? Who\ncould have expected her to associate with people who show contempt for\ntheir Maker's intentions by flippantly assuming other characters than\nthose in which He created them?'\n\n'You mistake her,' murmured Somerset, in a voice which he vainly\nendeavoured to attune to philosophy. 'Miss Power has some very rare and\nbeautiful qualities in her nature, though I confess I tremble--fear lest\nthe De Stancy influence should be too strong.'\n\n'Sir, it is already! Do you remember my telling you that I thought the\nforce of her surroundings would obscure the pure daylight of her spirit,\nas a monkish window of coloured images attenuates the rays of God's sun?\nI do not wish to indulge in rash surmises, but her oscillation from\nher family creed of Calvinistic truth towards the traditions of the De\nStancys has been so decided, though so gradual, that--well, I may be\nwrong.'\n\n'That what?' said the young man sharply.\n\n'I sometimes think she will take to her as husband the present\nrepresentative of that impoverished line--Captain De Stancy--which she\nmay easily do, if she chooses, as his behaviour to-day showed.'\n\n'He was probably there on account of his sister,' said Somerset, trying\nto escape the mental picture of farewell gallantries bestowed on Paula.\n\n'It was hinted at in the papers the other day.'\n\n'And it was flatly contradicted.'\n\n'Yes. Well, we shall see in the Lord's good time; I can do no more for\nher. And now, Mr. Somerset, pray take a cup of tea.'\n\nThe revelations of the minister depressed Somerset a little, and he did\nnot stay long. As he went to the door Woodwell said, 'There is a worthy\nman--the deacon of our chapel, Mr. Havill--who would like to be friendly\nwith you. Poor man, since the death of his wife he seems to have\nsomething on his mind--some trouble which my words will not reach. If\never you are passing his door, please give him a look in. He fears that\ncalling on you might be an intrusion.'\n\nSomerset did not clearly promise, and went his way. The minister's\nallusion to the announcement of the marriage reminded Somerset that she\nhad expressed a wish to know how the paragraph came to be inserted. The\nwish had been carelessly spoken; but he went to the newspaper office to\nmake inquiries on the point.\n\nThe reply was unexpected. The reporter informed his questioner that in\nreturning from the theatricals, at which he was present, he shared a fly\nwith a gentleman who assured him that such an alliance was certain,\nso obviously did it recommend itself to all concerned, as a means of\nstrengthening both families. The gentleman's knowledge of the Powers was\nso precise that the reporter did not hesitate to accept his assertion.\nHe was a man who had seen a great deal of the world, and his face was\nnoticeable for the seams and scars on it.\n\nSomerset recognized Paula's uncle in the portrait.\n\nHostilities, then, were beginning. The paragraph had been meant as the\nfirst slap. Taking her abroad was the second.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THE FOURTH. SOMERSET, DARE AND DE STANCY.\n\n\n\nI.\n\nThere was no part of Paula's journey in which Somerset did not think of\nher. He imagined her in the hotel at Havre, in her brief rest at Paris;\nher drive past the Place de la Bastille to the Boulevart Mazas to take\nthe train for Lyons; her tedious progress through the dark of a winter\nnight till she crossed the isothermal line which told of the beginning\nof a southern atmosphere, and onwards to the ancient blue sea.\n\nThus, between the hours devoted to architecture, he passed the next\nthree days. One morning he set himself, by the help of John, to practise\non the telegraph instrument, expecting a message. But though he watched\nthe machine at every opportunity, or kept some other person on the alert\nin its neighbourhood, no message arrived to gratify him till after the\nlapse of nearly a fortnight. Then she spoke from her new habitation nine\nhundred miles away, in these meagre words:--\n\n'Are settled at the address given. Can now attend to any inquiry about\nthe building.'\n\nThe pointed implication that she could attend to inquiries about nothing\nelse, breathed of the veritable Paula so distinctly that he could\nforgive its sauciness. His reply was soon despatched:--\n\n'Will write particulars of our progress. Always the same.'\n\nThe last three words formed the sentimental appendage which she had\nassured him she could tolerate, and which he hoped she might desire.\n\nHe spent the remainder of the day in making a little sketch to show what\nhad been done in the castle since her departure. This he despatched with\na letter of explanation ending in a paragraph of a different tenor:--\n\n'I have demonstrated our progress as well as I could; but another\nsubject has been in my mind, even whilst writing the former. Ask\nyourself if you use me well in keeping me a fortnight before you so much\nas say that you have arrived? The one thing that reconciled me to your\ndeparture was the thought that I should hear early from you: my idea of\nbeing able to submit to your absence was based entirely upon that.\n\n'But I have resolved not to be out of humour, and to believe that your\nscheme of reserve is not unreasonable; neither do I quarrel with your\ninjunction to keep silence to all relatives. I do not know anything I\ncan say to show you more plainly my acquiescence in your wish \"not to go\ntoo far\" (in short, to keep yourself dear--by dear I mean not cheap--you\nhave been dear in the other sense a long time, as you know), than by not\nurging you to go a single degree further in warmth than you please.'\n\nWhen this was posted he again turned his attention to her walls and\ntowers, which indeed were a dumb consolation in many ways for the lack\nof herself. There was no nook in the castle to which he had not access\nor could not easily obtain access by applying for the keys, and this\npropinquity of things belonging to her served to keep her image before\nhim even more constantly than his memories would have done.\n\nThree days and a half after the despatch of his subdued effusion the\ntelegraph called to tell him the good news that\n\n'Your letter and drawing are just received. Thanks for the latter. Will\nreply to the former by post this afternoon.'\n\nIt was with cheerful patience that he attended to his three draughtsmen\nin the studio, or walked about the environs of the fortress during the\nfifty hours spent by her presumably tender missive on the road. A light\nfleece of snow fell during the second night of waiting, inverting the\nposition of long-established lights and shades, and lowering to a dingy\ngrey the approximately white walls of other weathers; he could trace the\npostman's footmarks as he entered over the bridge, knowing them by the\ndot of his walking-stick: on entering the expected letter was waiting\nupon his table. He looked at its direction with glad curiosity; it was\nthe first letter he had ever received from her.\n\n\n'HOTEL ---, NICE,\n\nFeb. 14.\n\n'MY DEAR MR. SOMERSET' (the 'George,' then, to which she had so kindly\ntreated him in her last conversation, was not to be continued in black\nand white),--\n\n'Your letter explaining the progress of the work, aided by the sketch\nenclosed, gave me as clear an idea of the advance made since my\ndeparture as I could have gained by being present. I feel every\nconfidence in you, and am quite sure the restoration is in good hands.\nIn this opinion both my aunt and my uncle coincide. Please act\nentirely on your own judgment in everything, and as soon as you give a\ncertificate to the builders for the first instalment of their money it\nwill be promptly sent by my solicitors.\n\n'You bid me ask myself if I have used you well in not sending\nintelligence of myself till a fortnight after I had left you. Now,\nGeorge, don't be unreasonable! Let me remind you that, as a certain\napostle said, there are a thousand things lawful which are not\nexpedient. I say this, not from pride in my own conduct, but to offer\nyou a very fair explanation of it. Your resolve not to be out of humour\nwith me suggests that you have been sorely tempted that way, else why\nshould such a resolve have been necessary?\n\n'If you only knew what passes in my mind sometimes you would perhaps\nnot be so ready to blame. Shall I tell you? No. For, if it is a great\nemotion, it may afford you a cruel satisfaction at finding I suffer\nthrough separation; and if it be a growing indifference to you, it will\nbe inflicting gratuitous unhappiness upon you to say so, if you care for\nme; as I SOMETIMES think you may do A LITTLE.'\n\n('O, Paula!' said Somerset.)\n\n'Please which way would you have it? But it is better that you\nshould guess at what I feel than that you should distinctly know it.\nNotwithstanding this assertion you will, I know, adhere to your first\nprepossession in favour of prompt confessions. In spite of that, I fear\nthat upon trial such promptness would not produce that happiness which\nyour fancy leads you to expect. Your heart would weary in time, and when\nonce that happens, good-bye to the emotion you have told me of. Imagine\nsuch a case clearly, and you will perceive the probability of what I\nsay. At the same time I admit that a woman who is ONLY a creature of\nevasions and disguises is very disagreeable.\n\n'Do not write VERY frequently, and never write at all unless you have\nsome real information about the castle works to communicate. I will\nexplain to you on another occasion why I make this request. You will\npossibly set it down as additional evidence of my cold-heartedness.\nIf so you must. Would you also mind writing the business letter on\nan independent sheet, with a proper beginning and ending? Whether you\ninclose another sheet is of course optional.--Sincerely yours, PAULA\nPOWER.'\n\nSomerset had a suspicion that her order to him not to neglect the\nbusiness letter was to escape any invidious remarks from her uncle. He\nwished she would be more explicit, so that he might know exactly how\nmatters stood with them, and whether Abner Power had ever ventured to\nexpress disapproval of him as her lover.\n\nBut not knowing, he waited anxiously for a new architectural event on\nwhich he might legitimately send her another line. This occurred about\na week later, when the men engaged in digging foundations discovered\nremains of old ones which warranted a modification of the original plan.\nHe accordingly sent off his professional advice on the point, requesting\nher assent or otherwise to the amendment, winding up the inquiry with\n'Yours faithfully.' On another sheet he wrote:--'Do you suffer from any\nunpleasantness in the manner of others on account of me? If so, inform\nme, Paula. I cannot otherwise interpret your request for the separate\nsheets. While on this point I will tell you what I have learnt relative\nto the authorship of that false paragraph about your engagement. It\nwas communicated to the paper by your uncle. Was the wish father to the\nthought, or could he have been misled, as many were, by appearances at\nthe theatricals?\n\n'If I am not to write to you without a professional reason, surely\nyou can write to me without such an excuse? When you write tell me of\nyourself. There is nothing I so much wish to hear of. Write a great deal\nabout your daily doings, for my mind's eye keeps those sweet operations\nmore distinctly before me than my bodily sight does my own.\n\n'You say nothing of having been to look at the chapel-of-ease I told\nyou of, the plans of which I made when an architect's pupil, working in\nmetres instead of feet and inches, to my immense perplexity, that the\ndrawings might be understood by the foreign workmen. Go there and tell\nme what you think of its design. I can assure you that every curve\nthereof is my own.\n\n'How I wish you would invite me to run over and see you, if only for\na day or two, for my heart runs after you in a most distracted manner.\nDearest, you entirely fill my life! But I forget; we have resolved\nnot to go VERY FAR. But the fact is I am half afraid lest, with such\nreticence, you should not remember how very much I am yours, and with\nwhat a dogged constancy I shall always remember you. Paula, sometimes I\nhave horrible misgivings that something will divide us, especially if\nwe do not make a more distinct show of our true relationship. True do I\nsay? I mean the relationship which I think exists between us, but which\nyou do not affirm too clearly.--Yours always.'\n\nAway southward like the swallow went the tender lines. He wondered if\nshe would notice his hint of being ready to pay her a flying visit, if\npermitted to do so. His fancy dwelt on that further side of France,\nthe very contours of whose shore were now lines of beauty for him.\nHe prowled in the library, and found interest in the mustiest facts\nrelating to that place, learning with aesthetic pleasure that the number\nof its population was fifty thousand, that the mean temperature of its\natmosphere was 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and that the peculiarities of a\nmistral were far from agreeable.\n\nHe waited overlong for her reply; but it ultimately came. After the\nusual business preliminary, she said:--\n\n'As requested, I have visited the little church you designed. It gave me\ngreat pleasure to stand before a building whose outline and details had\ncome from the brain of such a valued friend and adviser.'\n\n('Valued friend and adviser,' repeated Somerset critically.)\n\n'I like the style much, especially that of the windows--Early English\nare they not? I am going to attend service there next Sunday, BECAUSE\nYOU WERE THE ARCHITECT, AND FOR NO GODLY REASON AT ALL. Does that\ncontent you? Fie for your despondency! Remember M. Aurelius: \"This is\nthe chief thing: Be not perturbed; for all things are of the nature\nof the Universal.\" Indeed I am a little surprised at your having\nforebodings, after my assurance to you before I left. I have none. My\nopinion is that, to be happy, it is best to think that, as we are the\nproduct of events, events will continue to produce that which is in\nharmony with us.... You are too faint-hearted, and that's the truth of\nit. I advise you not to abandon yourself to idolatry too readily; you\nknow what I mean. It fills me with remorse when I think how very far\nbelow such a position my actual worth removes me.\n\n'I should like to receive another letter from you as soon as you have\ngot over the misgiving you speak of, but don't write too soon. I wish I\ncould write anything to raise your spirits, but you may be so perverse\nthat if, in order to do this, I tell you of the races, routs, scenery,\ngaieties, and gambling going on in this place and neighbourhood (into\nwhich of course I cannot help being a little drawn), you may declare\nthat my words make you worse than ever. Don't pass the line I have set\ndown in the way you were tempted to do in your last; and not too many\nDearests--at least as yet. This is not a time for effusion. You have my\nvery warm affection, and that's enough for the present.'\n\nAs a love-letter this missive was tantalizing enough, but since its form\nwas simply a continuation of what she had practised before she left,\nit produced no undue misgiving in him. Far more was he impressed by her\nomitting to answer the two important questions he had put to her. First,\nconcerning her uncle's attitude towards them, and his conduct in giving\nsuch strange information to the reporter. Second, on his, Somerset's,\npaying her a flying visit some time during the spring. Since she had\nrequested it, he made no haste in his reply. When penned, it ran in\nthe words subjoined, which, in common with every line of their\ncorrespondence, acquired from the strangeness of subsequent\ncircumstances an interest and a force that perhaps they did not\nintrinsically possess.\n\n'People cannot' (he wrote) 'be for ever in good spirits on this gloomy\nside of the Channel, even though you seem to be so on yours. However,\nthat I can abstain from letting you know whether my spirits are good or\notherwise, I will prove in our future correspondence. I admire you more\nand more, both for the warm feeling towards me which I firmly believe\nyou have, and for your ability to maintain side by side with it so much\ndignity and resolution with regard to foolish sentiment. Sometimes I\nthink I could have put up with a little more weakness if it had brought\nwith it a little more tenderness, but I dismiss all that when I mentally\nsurvey your other qualities. I have thought of fifty things to say to\nyou of the TOO FAR sort, not one of any other; so that your prohibition\nis very unfortunate, for by it I am doomed to say things that do not\nrise spontaneously to my lips. You say that our shut-up feelings are not\nto be mentioned yet. How long is the yet to last?\n\n'But, to speak more solemnly, matters grow very serious with us,\nPaula--at least with me: and there are times when this restraint is\nreally unbearable. It is possible to put up with reserve when the\nreserved being is by one's side, for the eyes may reveal what the lips\ndo not. But when she is absent, what was piquancy becomes harshness,\ntender railleries become cruel sarcasm, and tacit understandings\nmisunderstandings. However that may be, you shall never be able to\nreproach me for touchiness. I still esteem you as a friend; I admire you\nand love you as a woman. This I shall always do, however unconfiding you\nprove.'\n\n\n\nII.\n\nWithout knowing it, Somerset was drawing near to a crisis in this soft\ncorrespondence which would speedily put his assertions to the test; but\nthe knowledge came upon him soon enough for his peace.\n\nHer next letter, dated March 9th, was the shortest of all he had\nreceived, and beyond the portion devoted to the building-works it\ncontained only the following sentences:--\n\n'I am almost angry with you, George, for being vexed because I am not\nmore effusive. Why should the verbal I LOVE YOU be ever uttered between\ntwo beings of opposite sex who have eyes to see signs? During the seven\nor eight months that we have known each other, you have discovered\nmy regard for you, and what more can you desire? Would a reiterated\nassertion of passion really do any good? Remember it is a natural\ninstinct with us women to retain the power of obliging a man to hope,\nfear, pray, and beseech as long as we think fit, before we confess to a\nreciprocal affection.\n\n'I am now going to own to a weakness about which I had intended to keep\nsilent. It will not perhaps add to your respect for me. My uncle,\nwhom in many ways I like, is displeased with me for keeping up this\ncorrespondence so regularly. I am quite perverse enough to venture\nto disregard his feelings; but considering the relationship, and his\nkindness in other respects, I should prefer not to do so at present.\nHonestly speaking, I want the courage to resist him in some things. He\nsaid to me the other day that he was very much surprised that I did not\ndepend upon his judgment for my future happiness. Whether that meant\nmuch or little, I have resolved to communicate with you only by\ntelegrams for the remainder of the time we are here. Please reply by the\nsame means only. There, now, don't flush and call me names! It is for\nthe best, and we want no nonsense, you and I. Dear George, I feel more\nthan I say, and if I do not speak more plainly, you will understand what\nis behind after all I have hinted. I can promise you that you will not\nlike me less upon knowing me better. Hope ever. I would give up a good\ndeal for you. Good-bye!'\n\nThis brought Somerset some cheerfulness and a good deal of gloom. He\nsilently reproached her, who was apparently so independent, for lacking\nindependence in such a vital matter. Perhaps it was mere sex, perhaps\nit was peculiar to a few, that her independence and courage, like\nCleopatra's, failed her occasionally at the last moment.\n\nOne curious impression which had often haunted him now returned with\nredoubled force. He could not see himself as the husband of Paula Power\nin any likely future. He could not imagine her his wife. People were apt\nto run into mistakes in their presentiments; but though he could picture\nher as queening it over him, as avowing her love for him unreservedly,\neven as compromising herself for him, he could not see her in a state of\ndomesticity with him.\n\nTelegrams being commanded, to the telegraph he repaired, when, after two\ndays, an immediate wish to communicate with her led him to dismiss\nvague conjecture on the future situation. His first telegram took the\nfollowing form:--\n\n'I give up the letter writing. I will part with anything to please you\nbut yourself. Your comfort with your relative is the first thing to be\nconsidered: not for the world do I wish you to make divisions within\ndoors. Yours.'\n\nTuesday, Wednesday, Thursday passed, and on Saturday a telegram came in\nreply:--\n\n'I can fear, grieve at, and complain of nothing, having your nice\npromise to consider my comfort always.'\n\nThis was very pretty; but it admitted little. Such short messages were\nin themselves poor substitutes for letters, but their speed and easy\nfrequency were good qualities which the letters did not possess. Three\ndays later he replied:--\n\n'You do not once say to me \"Come.\" Would such a strange accident as my\narrival disturb you much?'\n\nShe replied rather quickly:--\n\n'I am indisposed to answer you too clearly. Keep your heart strong: 'tis\na censorious world.'\n\nThe vagueness there shown made Somerset peremptory, and he could not\nhelp replying somewhat more impetuously than usual:-- 'Why do you give\nme so much cause for anxiety! Why treat me to so much mystification! Say\nonce, distinctly, that what I have asked is given.'\n\nHe awaited for the answer, one day, two days, a week; but none came. It\nwas now the end of March, and when Somerset walked of an afternoon\nby the river and pool in the lower part of the grounds, his ear newly\ngreeted by the small voices of frogs and toads and other creatures who\nhad been torpid through the winter, he became doubtful and uneasy that\nshe alone should be silent in the awakening year.\n\nHe waited through a second week, and there was still no reply. It was\npossible that the urgency of his request had tempted her to punish him,\nand he continued his walks, to, fro, and around, with as close an ear to\nthe undertones of nature, and as attentive an eye to the charms of his\nown art, as the grand passion would allow. Now came the days of battle\nbetween winter and spring. On these excursions, though spring was to the\nforward during the daylight, winter would reassert itself at night, and\nnot unfrequently at other moments. Tepid airs and nipping breezes met on\nthe confines of sunshine and shade; trembling raindrops that were still\nakin to frost crystals dashed themselves from the bushes as he pursued\nhis way from town to castle; the birds were like an orchestra waiting\nfor the signal to strike up, and colour began to enter into the country\nround.\n\nBut he gave only a modicum of thought to these proceedings. He rather\nthought such things as, 'She can afford to be saucy, and to find a\nsource of blitheness in my love, considering the power that wealth gives\nher to pick and choose almost where she will.' He was bound to own,\nhowever, that one of the charms of her conversation was the complete\nabsence of the note of the heiress from its accents. That, other things\nequal, her interest would naturally incline to a person bearing the name\nof De Stancy, was evident from her avowed predilections. His original\nassumption, that she was a personification of the modern spirit, who\nhad been dropped, like a seed from the bill of a bird, into a chink of\nmediaevalism, required some qualification. Romanticism, which will\nexist in every human breast as long as human nature itself exists, had\nasserted itself in her. Veneration for things old, not because of any\nmerit in them, but because of their long continuance, had developed in\nher; and her modern spirit was taking to itself wings and flying away.\nWhether his image was flying with the other was a question which moved\nhim all the more deeply now that her silence gave him dread of an\naffirmative answer.\n\nFor another seven days he stoically left in suspension all forecasts of\nhis possibly grim fate in being the employed and not the beloved. The\nweek passed: he telegraphed: there was no reply: he had sudden fears for\nher personal safety and resolved to break her command by writing.\n\n                                         'STANCY CASTLE, April\n13.\n\n'DEAR PAULA,--Are you ill or in trouble? It is impossible in the very\nunquiet state you have put me into by your silence that I should abstain\nfrom writing. Without affectation, you sorely distress me, and I think\nyou would hardly have done it could you know what a degree of anxiety\nyou cause. Why, Paula, do you not write or send to me? What have I done\nthat you should treat me like this? Do write, if it is only to reproach\nme. I am compelled to pass the greater part of the day in this castle,\nwhich reminds me constantly of you, and yet eternally lacks your\npresence. I am unfortunate indeed that you have not been able to find\nhalf-an-hour during the last month to tell me at least that you are\nalive.\n\n'You have always been ambiguous, it is true; but I thought I saw\nencouragement in your eyes; encouragement certainly was in your eyes,\nand who would not have been deluded by them and have believed them\nsincere? Yet what tenderness can there be in a heart that can cause me\npain so wilfully!\n\n'There may, of course, be some deliberate scheming on the part of your\nrelations to intercept our letters; but I cannot think it. I know that\nthe housekeeper has received a letter from your aunt this very week, in\nwhich she incidentally mentions that all are well, and in the same place\nas before. How then can I excuse you?\n\n'Then write, Paula, or at least telegraph, as you proposed. Otherwise I\nam resolved to take your silence as a signal to treat your fair words as\nwind, and to write to you no more.'\n\n\n\nIII.\n\nHe despatched the letter, and half-an-hour afterwards felt sure that it\nwould mortally offend her. But he had now reached a state of temporary\nindifference, and could contemplate the loss of such a tantalizing\nproperty with reasonable calm.\n\nIn the interim of waiting for a reply he was one day walking to Markton,\nwhen, passing Myrtle Villa, he saw Sir William De Stancy ambling about\nhis garden-path and examining the crocuses that palisaded its edge. Sir\nWilliam saw him and asked him to come in. Somerset was in the mood for\nany diversion from his own affairs, and they seated themselves by the\ndrawing-room fire.\n\n'I am much alone now,' said Sir William, 'and if the weather were not\nvery mild, so that I can get out into the garden every day, I should\nfeel it a great deal.'\n\n'You allude to your daughter's absence?'\n\n'And my son's. Strange to say, I do not miss her so much as I miss him.\nShe offers to return at any moment; but I do not wish to deprive her of\nthe advantages of a little foreign travel with her friend. Always, Mr.\nSomerset, give your spare time to foreign countries, especially those\nwhich contrast with your own in topography, language, and art. That's\nmy advice to all young people of your age. Don't waste your money on\nexpensive amusements at home. Practise the strictest economy at home, to\nhave a margin for going abroad.'\n\nEconomy, which Sir William had never practised, but to which, after\nexhausting all other practices, he now raised an altar, as the Athenians\ndid to the unknown God, was a topic likely to prolong itself on the\nbaronet's lips, and Somerset contrived to interrupt him by asking--\n\n'Captain De Stancy, too, has gone? Has the artillery, then, left the\nbarracks?'\n\n'No,' said Sir William. 'But my son has made use of his leave in running\nover to see his sister at Nice.'\n\nThe current of quiet meditation in Somerset changed to a busy whirl at\nthis reply. That Paula should become indifferent to his existence from a\nsense of superiority, physical, spiritual, or social, was a sufficiently\nironical thing; but that she should have relinquished him because of the\npresence of a rival lent commonplace dreariness to her cruelty.\n\nSir William, noting nothing, continued in the tone of clever\nchildishness which characterized him: 'It is very singular how the\npresent situation has been led up to by me. Policy, and policy alone,\nhas been the rule of my conduct for many years past; and when I say that\nI have saved my family by it, I believe time will show that I am within\nthe truth. I hope you don't let your passions outrun your policy, as so\nmany young men are apt to do. Better be poor and politic, than rich and\nheadstrong: that's the opinion of an old man. However, I was going\nto say that it was purely from policy that I allowed a friendship to\ndevelop between my daughter and Miss Power, and now events are proving\nthe wisdom of my course. Straws show how the wind blows, and there are\nlittle signs that my son Captain De Stancy will return to Stancy Castle\nby the fortunate step of marrying its owner. I say nothing to either of\nthem, and they say nothing to me; but my wisdom lies in doing nothing to\nhinder such a consummation, despite inherited prejudices.'\n\nSomerset had quite time enough to rein himself in during the old\ngentleman's locution, and the voice in which he answered was so cold and\nreckless that it did not seem his own: 'But how will they live happily\ntogether when she is a Dissenter, and a Radical, and a New-light, and\na Neo-Greek, and a person of red blood; while Captain De Stancy is the\nreverse of them all!'\n\n'I anticipate no difficulty on that score,' said the baronet. 'My son's\nstar lies in that direction, and, like the Magi, he is following it\nwithout trifling with his opportunity. You have skill in architecture,\ntherefore you follow it. My son has skill in gallantry, and now he is\nabout to exercise it profitably.'\n\n'May nobody wish him more harm in that exercise than I do!' said\nSomerset fervently.\n\nA stagnant moodiness of several hours which followed his visit to Myrtle\nVilla resulted in a resolve to journey over to Paula the very next day.\nHe now felt perfectly convinced that the inviting of Captain De Stancy\nto visit them at Nice was a second stage in the scheme of Paula's uncle,\nthe premature announcement of her marriage having been the first. The\nroundness and neatness of the whole plan could not fail to recommend\nit to the mind which delighted in putting involved things straight,\nand such a mind Abner Power's seemed to be. In fact, the felicity, in\na politic sense, of pairing the captain with the heiress furnished\nno little excuse for manoeuvring to bring it about, so long as that\nmanoeuvring fell short of unfairness, which Mr. Power's could scarcely\nbe said to do.\n\nThe next day was spent in furnishing the builders with such instructions\nas they might require for a coming week or ten days, and in dropping a\nshort note to Paula; ending as follows:--\n\n'I am coming to see you. Possibly you will refuse me an interview. Never\nmind, I am coming--Yours, G. SOMERSET.'\n\nThe morning after that he was up and away. Between him and Paula\nstretched nine hundred miles by the line of journey that he found it\nnecessary to adopt, namely, the way of London, in order to inform his\nfather of his movements and to make one or two business calls. The\nafternoon was passed in attending to these matters, the night in\nspeeding onward, and by the time that nine o'clock sounded next morning\nthrough the sunless and leaden air of the English Channel coasts, he had\nreduced the number of miles on his list by two hundred, and cut off the\nsea from the impediments between him and Paula.\n\nOn awakening from a fitful sleep in the grey dawn of the morning\nfollowing he looked out upon Lyons, quiet enough now, the citizens\nunaroused to the daily round of bread-winning, and enveloped in a haze\nof fog.\n\nSix hundred and fifty miles of his journey had been got over; there\nstill intervened two hundred and fifty between him and the end of\nsuspense. When he thought of that he was disinclined to pause; and\npressed on by the same train, which set him down at Marseilles at\nmid-day.\n\nHere he considered. By going on to Nice that afternoon he would\narrive at too late an hour to call upon her the same evening: it would\ntherefore be advisable to sleep in Marseilles and proceed the next\nmorning to his journey's end, so as to meet her in a brighter condition\nthan he could boast of to-day. This he accordingly did, and leaving\nMarseilles the next morning about eight, found himself at Nice early in\nthe afternoon.\n\nNow that he was actually at the centre of his gravitation he seemed even\nfurther away from a feasible meeting with her than in England. While\nafar off, his presence at Nice had appeared to be the one thing needful\nfor the solution of his trouble, but the very house fronts seemed now to\nask him what right he had there. Unluckily, in writing from England, he\nhad not allowed her time to reply before his departure, so that he\ndid not know what difficulties might lie in the way of her seeing him\nprivately. Before deciding what to do, he walked down the Avenue de la\nGare to the promenade between the shore and the Jardin Public, and sat\ndown to think.\n\nThe hotel which she had given him as her address looked right out upon\nhim and the sea beyond, and he rested there with the pleasing hope that\nher eyes might glance from a window and discover his form. Everything\nin the scene was sunny and gay. Behind him in the gardens a band was\nplaying; before him was the sea, the Great sea, the historical and\noriginal Mediterranean; the sea of innumerable characters in history and\nlegend that arranged themselves before him in a long frieze of memories\nso diverse as to include both AEneas and St. Paul.\n\nNorthern eyes are not prepared on a sudden for the impact of such images\nof warmth and colour as meet them southward, or for the vigorous\nlight that falls from the sky of this favoured shore. In any other\ncircumstances the transparency and serenity of the air, the perfume of\nthe sea, the radiant houses, the palms and flowers, would have acted\nupon Somerset as an enchantment, and wrapped him in a reverie; but at\npresent he only saw and felt these things as through a thick glass which\nkept out half their atmosphere.\n\nAt last he made up his mind. He would take up his quarters at her\nhotel, and catch echoes of her and her people, to learn somehow if their\nattitude towards him as a lover were actually hostile, before formally\nencountering them. Under this crystalline light, full of gaieties,\nsentiment, languor, seductiveness, and ready-made romance, the memory of\na solitary unimportant man in the lugubrious North might have faded from\nher mind. He was only her hired designer. He was an artist; but he had\nbeen engaged by her, and was not a volunteer; and she did not as yet\nknow that he meant to accept no return for his labours but the pleasure\nof presenting them to her as a love-offering.\n\nSo off he went at once towards the imposing building whither his letters\nhad preceded him. Owing to a press of visitors there was a moment's\ndelay before he could be attended to at the bureau, and he turned to the\nlarge staircase that confronted him, momentarily hoping that her figure\nmight descend. Her skirts must indeed have brushed the carpeting of\nthose steps scores of times. He engaged his room, ordered his luggage to\nbe sent for, and finally inquired for the party he sought.\n\n'They left Nice yesterday, monsieur,' replied madame.\n\nWas she quite sure, Somerset asked her?\n\nYes, she was quite sure. Two of the hotel carriages had driven them to\nthe station.\n\nDid she know where they had gone to?\n\nThis and other inquiries resulted in the information that they had\ngone to the hotel at Monte Carlo; that how long they were going to stay\nthere, and whether they were coming back again, was not known. His final\nquestion whether Miss Power had received a letter from England which\nmust have arrived the day previous was answered in the affirmative.\n\nSomerset's first and sudden resolve was to follow on after them to the\nhotel named; but he finally decided to make his immediate visit to Monte\nCarlo only a cautious reconnoitre, returning to Nice to sleep.\n\nAccordingly, after an early dinner, he again set forth through the broad\nAvenue de la Gare, and an hour on the coast railway brought him to the\nbeautiful and sinister little spot to which the Power and De Stancy\nparty had strayed in common with the rest of the frivolous throng.\n\nHe assumed that their visit thither would be chiefly one of curiosity,\nand therefore not prolonged. This proved to be the case in even greater\nmeasure than he had anticipated. On inquiry at the hotel he learnt that\nthey had stayed only one night, leaving a short time before his arrival,\nthough it was believed that some of the party were still in the town.\n\nIn a state of indecision Somerset strolled into the gardens of the\nCasino, and looked out upon the sea. There it still lay, calm yet\nlively; of an unmixed blue, yet variegated; hushed, but articulate even\nto melodiousness. Everything about and around this coast appeared indeed\njaunty, tuneful, and at ease, reciprocating with heartiness the rays of\nthe splendid sun; everything, except himself. The palms and flowers on\nthe terraces before him were undisturbed by a single cold breath. The\nmarble work of parapets and steps was unsplintered by frosts. The whole\nwas like a conservatory with the sky for its dome.\n\nFor want of other occupation he went round towards the public entrance\nto the Casino, and ascended the great staircase into the pillared hall.\nIt was possible, after all, that upon leaving the hotel and sending on\ntheir luggage they had taken another turn through the rooms, to\nfollow by a later train. With more than curiosity he scanned first the\nreading-rooms, only however to see not a face that he knew. He then\ncrossed the vestibule to the gaming-tables.\n\n\n\nIV.\n\nHere he was confronted by a heated phantasmagoria of splendour and a\nhigh pressure of suspense that seemed to make the air quiver. A low\nwhisper of conversation prevailed, which might probably have been not\nwrongly defined as the lowest note of social harmony.\n\nThe people gathered at this negative pole of industry had come from\nall civilized countries; their tongues were familiar with many forms of\nutterance, that of each racial group or type being unintelligible in its\nsubtler variations, if not entirely, to the rest. But the language of\nmeum and tuum they collectively comprehended without translation. In a\nhalf-charmed spell-bound state they had congregated in knots, standing,\nor sitting in hollow circles round the notorious oval tables marked with\nfigures and lines. The eyes of all these sets of people were watching\nthe Roulette. Somerset went from table to table, looking among the\nloungers rather than among the regular players, for faces, or at least\nfor one face, which did not meet his gaze.\n\nThe suggestive charm which the centuries-old impersonality Gaming,\nrather than games and gamesters, had for Somerset, led him to loiter on\neven when his hope of meeting any of the Power and De Stancy party had\nvanished. As a non-participant in its profits and losses, fevers and\nfrenzies, it had that stage effect upon his imagination which is\nusually exercised over those who behold Chance presented to them with\nspectacular piquancy without advancing far enough in its acquaintance to\nsuffer from its ghastly reprisals and impish tricks. He beheld a hundred\ndiametrically opposed wishes issuing from the murky intelligences around\na table, and spreading down across each other upon the figured diagram\nin their midst, each to its own number. It was a network of hopes; which\nat the announcement, 'Sept, Rouge, Impair, et Manque,' disappeared like\nmagic gossamer, to be replaced in a moment by new. That all the people\nthere, including himself, could be interested in what to the eye of\nperfect reason was a somewhat monotonous thing--the property of numbers\nto recur at certain longer or shorter intervals in a machine containing\nthem--in other words, the blind groping after fractions of a result\nthe whole of which was well known--was one testimony among many of the\npowerlessness of logic when confronted with imagination.\n\nAt this juncture our lounger discerned at one of the tables about the\nlast person in the world he could have wished to encounter there. It was\nDare, whom he had supposed to be a thousand miles off, hanging about the\npurlieus of Markton.\n\nDare was seated beside a table in an attitude of application which\nseemed to imply that he had come early and engaged in this pursuit in\na systematic manner. Somerset had never witnessed Dare and De Stancy\ntogether, neither had he heard of any engagement of Dare by the\ntravelling party as artist, courier, or otherwise; and yet it crossed\nhis mind that Dare might have had something to do with them, or at least\nhave seen them. This possibility was enough to overmaster Somerset's\nreluctance to speak to the young man, and he did so as soon as an\nopportunity occurred.\n\nDare's face was as rigid and dry as if it had been encrusted with\nplaster, and he was like one turned into a computing machine which no\nlonger had the power of feeling. He recognized Somerset as indifferently\nas if he had met him in the ward of Stancy Castle, and replying to his\nremarks by a word or two, concentrated on the game anew.\n\n'Are you here alone?' said Somerset presently.\n\n'Quite alone.' There was a silence, till Dare added, 'But I have seen\nsome friends of yours.' He again became absorbed in the events of the\ntable. Somerset retreated a few steps, and pondered the question whether\nDare could know where they had gone. He disliked to be beholden to Dare\nfor information, but he would give a great deal to know. While pausing\nhe watched Dare's play. He staked only five-franc pieces, but it was\ndone with an assiduity worthy of larger coin. At every half-minute or\nso he placed his money on a certain spot, and as regularly had the\nmortification of seeing it swept away by the croupier's rake. After a\nwhile he varied his procedure. He risked his money, which from the\nlook of his face seemed rather to have dwindled than increased, less\nrecklessly against long odds than before. Leaving off backing numbers en\nplein, he laid his venture a cheval; then tried it upon the dozens; then\nupon two numbers; then upon a square; and, apparently getting nearer and\nnearer defeat, at last upon the simple chances of even or odd, over or\nunder, red or black. Yet with a few fluctuations in his favour fortune\nbore steadily against him, till he could breast her blows no longer. He\nrose from the table and came towards Somerset, and they both moved on\ntogether into the entrance-hall.\n\nDare was at that moment the victim of an overpowering mania for more\nmoney. His presence in the South of Europe had its origin, as may be\nguessed, in Captain De Stancy's journey in the same direction, whom\nhe had followed, and troubled with persistent request for more funds,\ncarefully keeping out of sight of Paula and the rest. His dream of\ninvolving Paula in the De Stancy pedigree knew no abatement. But\nSomerset had lighted upon him at an instant when that idea, though not\ndisplaced, was overwhelmed by a rage for play. In hope of being able to\ncontinue it by Somerset's aid he was prepared to do almost anything to\nplease the architect.\n\n'You asked me,' said Dare, stroking his impassive brow, 'if I had seen\nanything of the Powers. I have seen them; and if I can be of any use to\nyou in giving information about them I shall only be too glad.'\n\n'What information can you give?'\n\n'I can tell you where they are gone to.'\n\n'Where?'\n\n'To the Grand Hotel, Genoa. They went on there this afternoon.'\n\n'Whom do you refer to by they?'\n\n'Mrs. Goodman, Mr. Power, Miss Power, Miss De Stancy, and the worthy\ncaptain. He leaves them tomorrow: he comes back here for a day on his\nway to England.'\n\nSomerset was silent. Dare continued: 'Now I have done you a favour, will\nyou do me one in return?'\n\nSomerset looked towards the gaming-rooms, and said dubiously, 'Well?'\n\n'Lend me two hundred francs.'\n\n'Yes,' said Somerset; 'but on one condition: that I don't give them to\nyou till you are inside the hotel you are staying at.'\n\n'That can't be; it's at Nice.'\n\n'Well I am going back to Nice, and I'll lend you the money the instant\nwe get there.'\n\n'But I want it here, now, instantly!' cried Dare; and for the first\ntime there was a wiry unreasonableness in his voice that fortified his\ncompanion more firmly than ever in his determination to lend the young\nman no money whilst he remained inside that building.\n\n'You want it to throw it away. I don't approve of it; so come with me.'\n\n'But,' said Dare, 'I arrived here with a hundred napoleons and more,\nexpressly to work out my theory of chances and recurrences, which is\nsound; I have studied it hundreds of times by the help of this.' He\npartially drew from his pocket the little volume that we have before\nseen in his hands. 'If I only persevere in my system, the certainty that\nI must win is almost mathematical. I have staked and lost two hundred\nand thirty-three times. Allowing out of that one chance in every\nthirty-six, which is the average of zero being marked, and two hundred\nand four times for the backers of the other numbers, I have the\nmathematical expectation of six times at least, which would nearly\nrecoup me. And shall I, then, sacrifice that vast foundation of waste\nchances that I have laid down, and paid for, merely for want of a little\nready money?'\n\n'You might persevere for a twelvemonth, and still not get the better of\nyour reverses. Time tells in favour of the bank. Just imagine for the\nsake of argument that all the people who have ever placed a stake upon a\ncertain number to be one person playing continuously. Has that imaginary\nperson won? The existence of the bank is a sufficient answer.'\n\n'But a particular player has the option of leaving off at any\npoint favourable to himself, which the bank has not; and there's my\nopportunity.'\n\n'Which from your mood you will be sure not to take advantage of.'\n\n'I shall go on playing,' said Dare doggedly.\n\n'Not with my money.'\n\n'Very well; we won't part as enemies,' replied Dare, with the flawless\npoliteness of a man whose speech has no longer any kinship with his\nfeelings. 'Shall we share a bottle of wine? You will not? Well, I hope\nyour luck with your lady will be more magnificent than mine has been\nhere; but--mind Captain De Stancy! he's a fearful wildfowl for you.'\n\n'He's a harmless inoffensive soldier, as far as I know. If he is\nnot--let him be what he may for me.'\n\n'And do his worst to cut you out, I suppose?'\n\n'Ay--if you will.' Somerset, much against his judgment, was being\nstimulated by these pricks into words of irritation. 'Captain De Stancy\nmight, I think, be better employed than in dangling at the heels of a\nlady who can well dispense with his company. And you might be better\nemployed than in wasting your wages here.'\n\n'Wages--a fit word for my money. May I ask you at what stage in the\nappearance of a man whose way of existence is unknown, his money ceases\nto be called wages and begins to be called means?'\n\nSomerset turned and left him without replying, Dare following his\nreceding figure with a look of ripe resentment, not less likely to vent\nitself in mischief from the want of moral ballast in him who emitted it.\nHe then fixed a nettled and unsatisfied gaze upon the gaming-rooms, and\nin another minute or two left the Casino also.\n\nDare and Somerset met no more that day. The latter returned to Nice by\nthe evening train and went straight to the hotel. He now thanked his\nfortune that he had not precipitately given up his room there, for a\ntelegram from Paula awaited him. His hand almost trembled as he opened\nit, to read the following few short words, dated from the Grand Hotel,\nGenoa:--\n\n'Letter received. Am glad to hear of your journey. We are not returning\nto Nice, but stay here a week. I direct this at a venture.'\n\nThis tantalizing message--the first breaking of her recent silence--was\nsaucy, almost cruel, in its dry frigidity. It led him to give up his\nidea of following at once to Genoa. That was what she obviously expected\nhim to do, and it was possible that his non-arrival might draw a letter\nor message from her of a sweeter composition than this. That would at\nleast be the effect of his tardiness if she cared in the least for him;\nif she did not he could bear the worst. The argument was good enough as\nfar as it went, but, like many more, failed from the narrowness of its\npremises, the contingent intervention of Dare being entirely undreamt\nof. It was altogether a fatal miscalculation, which cost him dear.\n\nPassing by the telegraph-office in the Rue Pont-Neuf at an early hour\nthe next morning he saw Dare coming out from the door. It was Somerset's\nmomentary impulse to thank Dare for the information given as to Paula's\nwhereabouts, information which had now proved true. But Dare did not\nseem to appreciate his friendliness, and after a few words of studied\ncivility the young man moved on.\n\nAnd well he might. Five minutes before that time he had thrown open a\ngulf of treachery between himself and the architect which nothing in\nlife could ever close. Before leaving the telegraph-office Dare had\ndespatched the following message to Paula direct, as a set-off against\nwhat he called Somerset's ingratitude for valuable information, though\nit was really the fruit of many passions, motives, and desires:--\n\n'G. Somerset, Nice, to Miss Power, Grand Hotel, Genoa.\n\n'Have lost all at Monte Carlo. Have learnt that Captain D. S. returns\nhere to-morrow. Please send me one hundred pounds by him, and save\nme from disgrace. Will await him at eleven o'clock and four, on the\nPont-Neuf.'\n\n\n\nV.\n\nFive hours after the despatch of that telegram Captain De Stancy was\nrattling along the coast railway of the Riviera from Genoa to Nice.\nHe was returning to England by way of Marseilles; but before turning\nnorthwards he had engaged to perform on Miss Power's account a peculiar\nand somewhat disagreeable duty. This was to place in Somerset's hands a\nhundred and twenty-five napoleons which had been demanded from her by a\nmessage in Somerset's name. The money was in his pocket--all in gold,\nin a canvas bag, tied up by Paula's own hands, which he had observed to\ntremble as she tied it.\n\nAs he leaned in the corner of the carriage he was thinking over the\nevents of the morning which had culminated in that liberal response. At\nten o'clock, before he had gone out from the hotel where he had taken up\nhis quarters, which was not the same as the one patronized by Paula\nand her friends, he had been summoned to her presence in a manner\nso unexpected as to imply that something serious was in question.\nOn entering her room he had been struck by the absence of that\nsaucy independence usually apparent in her bearing towards him,\nnotwithstanding the persistency with which he had hovered near her for\nthe previous month, and gradually, by the position of his sister, and\nthe favour of Paula's uncle in intercepting one of Somerset's letters\nand several of his telegrams, established himself as an intimate member\nof the travelling party. His entry, however, this time as always,\nhad had the effect of a tonic, and it was quite with her customary\nself-possession that she had told him of the object of her message.\n\n'You think of returning to Nice this afternoon?' she inquired.\n\nDe Stancy informed her that such was his intention, and asked if he\ncould do anything for her there.\n\nThen, he remembered, she had hesitated. 'I have received a telegram,'\nshe said at length; and so she allowed to escape her bit by bit the\ninformation that her architect, whose name she seemed reluctant to\nutter, had travelled from England to Nice that week, partly to consult\nher, partly for a holiday trip; that he had gone on to Monte Carlo, had\nthere lost his money and got into difficulties, and had appealed to her\nto help him out of them by the immediate advance of some ready cash. It\nwas a sad case, an unexpected case, she murmured, with her eyes fixed on\nthe window. Indeed she could not comprehend it.\n\nTo De Stancy there appeared nothing so very extraordinary in Somerset's\napparent fiasco, except in so far as that he should have applied to\nPaula for relief from his distresses instead of elsewhere. It was a\nself-humiliation which a lover would have avoided at all costs, he\nthought. Yet after a momentary reflection on his theory of Somerset's\ncharacter, it seemed sufficiently natural that he should lean\npersistently on Paula, if only with a view of keeping himself linked to\nher memory, without thinking too profoundly of his own dignity. That\nthe esteem in which she had held Somerset up to that hour suffered\na tremendous blow by his apparent scrape was clearly visible in her,\nreticent as she was; and De Stancy, while pitying Somerset, thanked him\nin his mind for having gratuitously given a rival an advantage which\nthat rival's attentions had never been able to gain of themselves.\n\nAfter a little further conversation she had said: 'Since you are to be\nmy messenger, I must tell you that I have decided to send the hundred\npounds asked for, and you will please to deliver them into no hands but\nhis own.' A curious little blush crept over her sobered face--perhaps it\nwas a blush of shame at the conduct of the young man in whom she had\nof late been suspiciously interested--as she added, 'He will be on the\nPont-Neuf at four this afternoon and again at eleven tomorrow. Can you\nmeet him there?'\n\n'Certainly,' De Stancy replied.\n\nShe then asked him, rather anxiously, how he could account for Mr.\nSomerset knowing that he, Captain De Stancy, was about to return to\nNice?\n\nDe Stancy informed her that he left word at the hotel of his intention\nto return, which was quite true; moreover, there did not lurk in his\nmind at the moment of speaking the faintest suspicion that Somerset had\nseen Dare.\n\nShe then tied the bag and handed it to him, leaving him with a serene\nand impenetrable bearing, which he hoped for his own sake meant an\nacquired indifference to Somerset and his fortunes. Her sending the\narchitect a sum of money which she could easily spare might be set\ndown to natural generosity towards a man with whom she was artistically\nco-operating for the improvement of her home.\n\nShe came back to him again for a moment. 'Could you possibly get there\nbefore four this afternoon?' she asked, and he informed her that he\ncould just do so by leaving almost at once, which he was very willing\nto do, though by so forestalling his time he would lose the projected\nmorning with her and the rest at the Palazzo Doria.\n\n'I may tell you that I shall not go to the Palazzo Doria either, if\nit is any consolation to you to know it,' was her reply. 'I shall sit\nindoors and think of you on your journey.'\n\nThe answer admitted of two translations, and conjectures thereon filled\nthe gallant soldier's mind during the greater part of the journey. He\narrived at the hotel they had all stayed at in succession about six\nhours after Somerset had left it for a little excursion to San Remo and\nits neighbourhood, as a means of passing a few days till Paula should\nwrite again to inquire why he had not come on. De Stancy saw no one he\nknew, and in obedience to Paula's commands he promptly set off on foot\nfor the Pont-Neuf.\n\nThough opposed to the architect as a lover, De Stancy felt for him as\na poor devil in need of money, having had experiences of that sort\nhimself, and he was really anxious that the needful supply entrusted\nto him should reach Somerset's hands. He was on the bridge five minutes\nbefore the hour, and when the clock struck a hand was laid on his\nshoulder: turning he beheld Dare.\n\nKnowing that the youth was loitering somewhere along the coast, for they\nhad frequently met together on De Stancy's previous visit, the latter\nmerely said, 'Don't bother me for the present, Willy, I have an\nengagement. You can see me at the hotel this evening.'\n\n'When you have given me the hundred pounds I will fly like a rocket,\ncaptain,' said the young gentleman. 'I keep the appointment instead of\nthe other man.'\n\nDe Stancy looked hard at him. 'How--do you know about this?' he asked\nbreathlessly.\n\n'I have seen him.'\n\nDe Stancy took the young man by the two shoulders and gazed into his\neyes. The scrutiny seemed not altogether to remove the suspicion which\nhad suddenly started up in his mind. 'My soul,' he said, dropping his\narms, 'can this be true?'\n\n'What?'\n\n'You know.'\n\nDare shrugged his shoulders; 'Are you going to hand over the money or\nno?' he said.\n\n'I am going to make inquiries,' said De Stancy, walking away with a\nvehement tread.\n\n'Captain, you are without natural affection,' said Dare, walking by his\nside, in a tone which showed his fear that he had over-estimated that\nemotion. 'See what I have done for you. You have been my constant care\nand anxiety for I can't tell how long. I have stayed awake at night\nthinking how I might best give you a good start in the world by\narranging this judicious marriage, when you have been sleeping as sound\nas a top with no cares upon your mind at all, and now I have got into\na scrape--as the most thoughtful of us may sometimes--you go to make\ninquiries.'\n\n'I have promised the lady to whom this money belongs--whose generosity\nhas been shamefully abused in some way--that I will deliver it into no\nhands but those of one man, and he has not yet appeared. I therefore go\nto find him.'\n\nDare laid his hand upon De Stancy's arm. 'Captain, we are both warm, and\npunctilious on points of honour; this will come to a split between us if\nwe don't mind. So, not to bring matters to a crisis, lend me ten pounds\nhere to enable me to get home, and I'll disappear.'\n\nIn a state bordering on distraction, eager to get the young man out\nof his sight before worse revelations should rise up between them, De\nStancy without pausing in his walk gave him the sum demanded. He soon\nreached the post-office, where he inquired if a Mr. Somerset had left\nany directions for forwarding letters.\n\nIt was just what Somerset had done. De Stancy was told that Mr. Somerset\nhad commanded that any letters should be sent on to him at the Hotel\nVictoria, San Remo.\n\nIt was now evident that the scheme of getting money from Paula was\neither of Dare's invention, or that Somerset, ashamed of his first\nimpulse, had abandoned it as speedily as it had been formed. De Stancy\nturned and went out. Dare, in keeping with his promise, had vanished.\nCaptain De Stancy resolved to do nothing in the case till further events\nshould enlighten him, beyond sending a line to Miss Power to inform her\nthat Somerset had not appeared, and that he therefore retained the money\nfor further instructions.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THE FIFTH. DE STANCY AND PAULA.\n\n\nI.\n\nMiss Power was reclining on a red velvet couch in the bedroom of an\nold-fashioned red hotel at Strassburg, and her friend Miss De Stancy was\nsitting by a window of the same apartment. They were both rather wearied\nby a long journey of the previous day. The hotel overlooked the large\nopen Kleber Platz, erect in the midst of which the bronze statue of\nGeneral Kleber received the rays of a warm sun that was powerless to\nbrighten him. The whole square, with its people and vehicles going to\nand fro as if they had plenty of time, was visible to Charlotte in her\nchair; but Paula from her horizontal position could see nothing below\nthe level of the many dormered house-tops on the opposite side of the\nPlatz. After watching this upper storey of the city for some time in\nsilence, she asked Charlotte to hand her a binocular lying on the table,\nthrough which instrument she quietly regarded the distant roofs.\n\n'What strange and philosophical creatures storks are,' she said. 'They\ngive a taciturn, ghostly character to the whole town.'\n\nThe birds were crossing and recrossing the field of the glass in their\nflight hither and thither between the Strassburg chimneys, their sad\ngrey forms sharply outlined against the sky, and their skinny legs\nshowing beneath like the limbs of dead martyrs in Crivelli's emaciated\nimaginings. The indifference of these birds to all that was going on\nbeneath them impressed her: to harmonize with their solemn and silent\nmovements the houses beneath should have been deserted, and grass\ngrowing in the streets.\n\nBehind the long roofs thus visible to Paula over the window-sill,\nwith their tiers of dormer-windows, rose the cathedral spire in\nairy openwork, forming the highest object in the scene; it suggested\nsomething which for a long time she appeared unwilling to utter; but\nnatural instinct had its way.\n\n'A place like this,' she said, 'where he can study Gothic architecture,\nwould, I should have thought, be a spot more congenial to him than\nMonaco.'\n\nThe person referred to was the misrepresented Somerset, whom the two had\nbeen gingerly discussing from time to time, allowing any casual subject,\nsuch as that of the storks, to interrupt the personal one at every two\nor three sentences.\n\n'It would be more like him to be here,' replied Miss De Stancy, trusting\nher tongue with only the barest generalities on this matter.\n\nSomerset was again dismissed for the stork topic, but Paula could\nnot let him alone; and she presently resumed, as if an irresistible\nfascination compelled what judgment had forbidden: 'The strongest-minded\npersons are sometimes caught unawares at that place, if they once think\nthey will retrieve their first losses; and I am not aware that he is\nparticularly strong-minded.'\n\nFor a moment Charlotte looked at her with a mixed expression, in which\nthere was deprecation that a woman with any feeling should criticize\nSomerset so frigidly, and relief that it was Paula who did so. For,\nnotwithstanding her assumption that Somerset could never be anything\nmore to her than he was already, Charlotte's heart would occasionally\nstep down and trouble her views so expressed.\n\nWhether looking through a glass at distant objects enabled Paula to\nbottle up her affection for the absent one, or whether her friend\nCharlotte had so little personality in Paula's regard that she could\ncommune with her as with a lay figure, it was certain that she evinced\nremarkable ease in speaking of Somerset, resuming her words about him in\nthe tone of one to whom he was at most an ordinary professional adviser.\n'It would be very awkward for the works at the castle if he has got\ninto a scrape. I suppose the builders were well posted with instructions\nbefore he left: but he ought certainly to return soon. Why did he leave\nEngland at all just now?'\n\n'Perhaps it was to see you.'\n\n'He should have waited; it would not have been so dreadfully long to May\nor June. Charlotte, how can a man who does such a hare-brained thing as\nthis be deemed trustworthy in an important work like that of rebuilding\nStancy Castle?'\n\nThere was such stress in the inquiry that, whatever factitiousness had\ngone before, Charlotte perceived Paula to be at last speaking her mind;\nand it seemed as if Somerset must have considerably lost ground in her\nopinion, or she would not have criticized him thus.\n\n'My brother will tell us full particulars when he comes: perhaps it is\nnot at all as we suppose,' said Charlotte. She strained her eyes across\nthe Platz and added, 'He ought to have been here before this time.'\n\nWhile they waited and talked, Paula still observing the storks, the\nhotel omnibus came round the corner from the station. 'I believe he has\narrived,' resumed Miss De Stancy; 'I see something that looks like his\nportmanteau on the top of the omnibus.... Yes; it is his baggage. I'll\nrun down to him.'\n\nDe Stancy had obtained six weeks' additional leave on account of his\nhealth, which had somewhat suffered in India. The first use he made of\nhis extra time was in hastening back to meet the travelling ladies here\nat Strassburg. Mr. Power and Mrs. Goodman were also at the hotel, and\nwhen Charlotte got downstairs, the former was welcoming De Stancy at the\ndoor.\n\nPaula had not seen him since he set out from Genoa for Nice,\ncommissioned by her to deliver the hundred pounds to Somerset. His note,\nstating that he had failed to meet Somerset, contained no details,\nand she guessed that he would soon appear before her now to answer any\nquestion about that peculiar errand.\n\nHer anticipations were justified by the event; she had no sooner gone\ninto the next sitting-room than Charlotte De Stancy appeared and asked\nif her brother might come up. The closest observer would have been in\ndoubt whether Paula's ready reply in the affirmative was prompted by\npersonal consideration for De Stancy, or by a hope to hear more of his\nmission to Nice. As soon as she had welcomed him she reverted at once to\nthe subject.\n\n'Yes, as I told you, he was not at the place of meeting,' De Stancy\nreplied. And taking from his pocket the bag of ready money he placed it\nintact upon the table.\n\nDe Stancy did this with a hand that shook somewhat more than a long\nrailway journey was adequate to account for; and in truth it was the\nvision of Dare's position which agitated the unhappy captain: for had\nthat young man, as De Stancy feared, been tampering with Somerset's\nname, his fate now trembled in the balance; Paula would unquestionably\nand naturally invoke the aid of the law against him if she discovered\nsuch an imposition.\n\n'Were you punctual to the time mentioned?' she asked curiously.\n\nDe Stancy replied in the affirmative.\n\n'Did you wait long?' she continued.\n\n'Not very long,' he answered, his instinct to screen the possibly guilty\none confining him to guarded statements, while still adhering to the\nliteral truth.\n\n'Why was that?'\n\n'Somebody came and told me that he would not appear.'\n\n'Who?'\n\n'A young man who has been acting as his clerk. His name is Dare. He\ninformed me that Mr. Somerset could not keep the appointment.'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'He had gone on to San Remo.'\n\n'Has he been travelling with Mr. Somerset?'\n\n'He had been with him. They know each other very well. But as you\ncommissioned me to deliver the money into no hands but Mr. Somerset's, I\nadhered strictly to your instructions.'\n\n'But perhaps my instructions were not wise. Should it in your opinion\nhave been sent by this young man? Was he commissioned to ask you for\nit?'\n\nDe Stancy murmured that Dare was not commissioned to ask for it; that\nupon the whole he deemed her instructions wise; and was still of opinion\nthat the best thing had been done.\n\nAlthough De Stancy was distracted between his desire to preserve Dare\nfrom the consequences of folly, and a gentlemanly wish to keep as close\nto the truth as was compatible with that condition, his answers had not\nappeared to Paula to be particularly evasive, the conjuncture being one\nin which a handsome heiress's shrewdness was prone to overleap itself\nby setting down embarrassment on the part of the man she questioned to a\nmere lover's difficulty in steering between honour and rivalry.\n\nShe put but one other question. 'Did it appear as if he, Mr. Somerset,\nafter telegraphing, had--had--regretted doing so, and evaded the result\nby not keeping the appointment?'\n\n'That's just how it appears.' The words, which saved Dare from ignominy,\ncost De Stancy a good deal. He was sorry for Somerset, sorry for\nhimself, and very sorry for Paula. But Dare was to De Stancy what\nSomerset could never be: and 'for his kin that is near unto him shall a\nman be defiled.'\n\nAfter that interview Charlotte saw with warring impulses that Somerset\nslowly diminished in Paula's estimate; slowly as the moon wanes, but as\ncertainly. Charlotte's own love was of a clinging, uncritical sort, and\nthough the shadowy intelligence of Somerset's doings weighed down her\nsoul with regret, it seemed to make not the least difference in her\naffection for him.\n\nIn the afternoon the whole party, including De Stancy, drove about the\nstreets. Here they looked at the house in which Goethe had lived, and\nafterwards entered the cathedral. Observing in the south transept\na crowd of people waiting patiently, they were reminded that they\nunwittingly stood in the presence of the popular clock-work of\nSchwilgue.\n\nMr. Power and Mrs. Goodman decided that they would wait with the rest of\nthe idlers and see the puppets perform at the striking. Charlotte also\nwaited with them; but as it wanted eight minutes to the hour, and as\nPaula had seen the show before, she moved on into the nave.\n\nPresently she found that De Stancy had followed. He did not come close\ntill she, seeing him stand silent, said, 'If it were not for this\ncathedral, I should not like the city at all; and I have even seen\ncathedrals I like better. Luckily we are going on to Baden to-morrow.'\n\n'Your uncle has just told me. He has asked me to keep you company.'\n\n'Are you intending to?' said Paula, probing the base-moulding of a pier\nwith her parasol.\n\n'I have nothing better to do, nor indeed half so good,' said De Stancy.\n'I am abroad for my health, you know, and what's like the Rhine and its\nneighbourhood in early summer, before the crowd comes? It is delightful\nto wander about there, or anywhere, like a child, influenced by no fixed\nmotive more than that of keeping near some friend, or friends, including\nthe one we most admire in the world.'\n\n'That sounds perilously like love-making.'\n\n''Tis love indeed.'\n\n'Well, love is natural to men, I suppose,' rejoined the young lady. 'But\nyou must love within bounds; or you will be enervated, and cease to be\nuseful as a heavy arm of the service.'\n\n'My dear Miss Power, your didactic and respectable rules won't do for\nme. If you expect straws to stop currents, you are sadly mistaken! But\nno--let matters be: I am a happy contented mortal at present, say what\nyou will.... You don't ask why? Perhaps you know. It is because all I\ncare for in the world is near me, and that I shall never be more than a\nhundred yards from her as long as the present arrangement continues.'\n\n'We are in a cathedral, remember, Captain De Stancy, and should not keep\nup a secular conversation.'\n\n'If I had never said worse in a cathedral than what I have said here,\nI should be content to meet my eternal judge without absolution. Your\nuncle asked me this morning how I liked you.'\n\n'Well, there was no harm in that.'\n\n'How I like you! Harm, no; but you should have seen how silly I looked.\nFancy the inadequacy of the expression when my whole sense is absorbed\nby you.'\n\n'Men allow themselves to be made ridiculous by their own feelings in an\ninconceivable way.'\n\n'True, I am a fool; but forgive me,' he rejoined, observing her gaze,\nwhich wandered critically from roof to clerestory, and then to the\npillars, without once lighting on him. 'Don't mind saying Yes.--You look\nat this thing and that thing, but you never look at me, though I stand\nhere and see nothing but you.'\n\n'There, the clock is striking--and the cock crows. Please go across to\nthe transept and tell them to come out this way.'\n\nDe Stancy went. When he had gone a few steps he turned his head. She\nhad at last ceased to study the architecture, and was looking at him.\nPerhaps his words had struck her, for it seemed at that moment as if he\nread in her bright eyes a genuine interest in him and his fortunes.\n\n\n\nII.\n\nNext day they went on to Baden. De Stancy was beginning to cultivate the\npassion of love even more as an escape from the gloomy relations of\nhis life than as matrimonial strategy. Paula's juxtaposition had the\nattribute of making him forget everything in his own history. She was a\nmagic alterative; and the most foolish boyish shape into which he could\nthrow his feelings for her was in this respect to be aimed at as the act\nof highest wisdom.\n\nHe supplemented the natural warmth of feeling that she had wrought in\nhim by every artificial means in his power, to make the distraction the\nmore complete. He had not known anything like this self-obscuration for\na dozen years, and when he conjectured that she might really learn to\nlove him he felt exalted in his own eyes and purified from the dross of\nhis former life. Such uneasiness of conscience as arose when he suddenly\nremembered Dare, and the possibility that Somerset was getting ousted\nunfairly, had its weight in depressing him; but he was inclined to\naccept his fortune without much question.\n\nThe journey to Baden, though short, was not without incidents on which\nhe could work out this curious hobby of cultivating to superlative power\nan already positive passion. Handing her in and out of the carriage,\naccidentally getting brushed by her clothes, of all such as this he made\navailable fuel. Paula, though she might have guessed the general nature\nof what was going on, seemed unconscious of the refinements he was\ntrying to throw into it, and sometimes, when in stepping into or from a\nrailway carriage she unavoidably put her hand upon his arm, the obvious\ninsignificance she attached to the action struck him with misgiving.\n\nOne of the first things they did at Baden was to stroll into the\nTrink-halle, where Paula sipped the water. She was about to put down the\nglass, when De Stancy quickly took it from her hands as though to make\nuse of it himself.\n\n'O, if that is what you mean,' she said mischievously, 'you should\nhave noticed the exact spot. It was there.' She put her finger on a\nparticular portion of its edge.\n\n'You ought not to act like that, unless you mean something, Miss Power,'\nhe replied gravely.\n\n'Tell me more plainly.'\n\n'I mean, you should not do things which excite in me the hope that you\ncare something for me, unless you really do.'\n\n'I put my finger on the edge and said it was there.'\n\n'Meaning, \"It was there my lips touched; let yours do the same.\"'\n\n'The latter part I wholly deny,' she answered, with disregard, after\nwhich she went away, and kept between Charlotte and her aunt for the\nrest of the afternoon.\n\nSince the receipt of the telegram Paula had been frequently silent; she\nfrequently stayed in alone, and sometimes she became quite gloomy--an\naltogether unprecedented phase for her. This was the case on the morning\nafter the incident in the Trink-halle. Not to intrude on her, Charlotte\nwalked about the landings of the sunny white hotel in which they had\ntaken up their quarters, went down into the court, and petted the\ntortoises that were creeping about there among the flowers and plants;\ntill at last, on going to her friend, she caught her reading some old\nletters of Somerset's.\n\nPaula made no secret of them, and Miss De Stancy could see that more\nthan half were written on blue paper, with diagrams amid the writing:\nthey were, in fact, simply those sheets of his letters which related to\nthe rebuilding. Nevertheless, Charlotte fancied she had caught Paula in\na sentimental mood; and doubtless could Somerset have walked in at\nthis moment instead of Charlotte it might have fared well with him,\nso insidiously do tender memories reassert themselves in the face of\noutward mishaps.\n\nThey took a drive down the Lichtenthal road and then into the forest, De\nStancy and Abner Power riding on horseback alongside. The sun streamed\nyellow behind their backs as they wound up the long inclines, lighting\nthe red trunks, and even the blue-black foliage itself. The summer had\nalready made impression upon that mass of uniform colour by tipping\nevery twig with a tiny sprout of virescent yellow; while the minute\nsounds which issued from the forest revealed that the apparently still\nplace was becoming a perfect reservoir of insect life.\n\nAbner Power was quite sentimental that day. 'In such places as these,'\nhe said, as he rode alongside Mrs. Goodman, 'nature's powers in the\nmultiplication of one type strike me as much as the grandeur of the\nmass.'\n\nMrs. Goodman agreed with him, and Paula said, 'The foliage forms the\nroof of an interminable green crypt, the pillars being the trunks, and\nthe vault the interlacing boughs.'\n\n'It is a fine place in a thunderstorm,' said De Stancy. 'I am not an\nenthusiast, but to see the lightning spring hither and thither,\nlike lazy-tongs, bristling, and striking, and vanishing, is rather\nimpressive.'\n\n'It must be indeed,' said Paula.\n\n'And in the winter winds these pines sigh like ten thousand spirits in\ntrouble.'\n\n'Indeed they must,' said Paula.\n\n'At the same time I know a little fir-plantation about a mile square\nnot far from Markton,' said De Stancy, 'which is precisely like this\nin miniature,--stems, colours, slopes, winds, and all. If we were to go\nthere any time with a highly magnifying pair of spectacles it would look\nas fine as this--and save a deal of travelling.'\n\n'I know the place, and I agree with you,' said Paula.\n\n'You agree with me on all subjects but one,' he presently observed, in a\nvoice not intended to reach the others.\n\nPaula looked at him, but was silent.\n\nOnward and upward they went, the same pattern and colour of tree\nrepeating themselves endlessly, till in a couple of hours they reached\nthe castle hill which was to be the end of their journey, and beheld\nstretched beneath them the valley of the Murg. They alighted and entered\nthe fortress.\n\n'What did you mean by that look of kindness you bestowed upon me just\nnow, when I said you agreed with me on all subjects but one?' asked\nDe Stancy half humorously, as he held open a little door for her, the\nothers having gone ahead.\n\n'I meant, I suppose, that I was much obliged to you for not requiring\nagreement on that one subject,' she said, passing on.\n\n'Not more than that?' said De Stancy, as he followed her. 'But whenever\nI involuntarily express towards you sentiments that there can be no\nmistaking, you seem truly compassionate.'\n\n'If I seem so, I feel so.'\n\n'If you mean no more than mere compassion, I wish you would show nothing\nat all, for your mistaken kindness is only preparing more misery for me\nthan I should have if let alone to suffer without mercy.'\n\n'I implore you to be quiet, Captain De Stancy! Leave me, and look out\nof the window at the view here, or at the pictures, or at the armour, or\nwhatever it is we are come to see.'\n\n'Very well. But pray don't extract amusement from my harmless remarks.\nSuch as they are I mean them.'\n\nShe stopped him by changing the subject, for they had entered an\noctagonal chamber on the first floor, presumably full of pictures and\ncuriosities; but the shutters were closed, and only stray beams of light\ngleamed in to suggest what was there.\n\n'Can't somebody open the windows?' said Paula.\n\n'The attendant is about to do it,' said her uncle; and as he spoke the\nshutters to the east were flung back, and one of the loveliest views in\nthe forest disclosed itself outside.\n\nSome of them stepped out upon the balcony. The river lay along the\nbottom of the valley, irradiated with a silver shine. Little rafts of\npinewood floated on its surface like tiny splinters, the men who steered\nthem not appearing larger than ants.\n\nPaula stood on the balcony, looking for a few minutes upon the sight,\nand then came into the shadowy room, where De Stancy had remained. While\nthe rest were still outside she resumed: 'You must not suppose that I\nshrink from the subject you so persistently bring before me. I respect\ndeep affection--you know I do; but for me to say that I have any such\nfor you, of the particular sort you only will be satisfied with, would\nbe absurd. I don't feel it, and therefore there can be nothing between\nus. One would think it would be better to feel kindly towards you than\nto feel nothing at all. But if you object to that I'll try to feel\nnothing.'\n\n'I don't really object to your sympathy,' said De Stancy, rather struck\nby her seriousness. 'But it is very saddening to think you can feel\nnothing more.'\n\n'It must be so, since I CAN feel no more,' she decisively replied,\nadding, as she stopped her seriousness: 'You must pray for strength to\nget over it.'\n\n'One thing I shall never pray for; to see you give yourself to another\nman. But I suppose I shall witness that some day.'\n\n'You may,' she gravely returned.\n\n'You have no doubt chosen him already,' cried the captain bitterly.\n\n'No, Captain De Stancy,' she said shortly, a faint involuntary blush\ncoming into her face as she guessed his allusion.\n\nThis, and a few glances round at the pictures and curiosities, completed\ntheir survey of the castle. De Stancy knew better than to trouble her\nfurther that day with special remarks. During the return journey he rode\nahead with Mr. Power and she saw no more of him.\n\nShe would have been astonished had she heard the conversation of the two\ngentlemen as they wound gently downwards through the trees.\n\n'As far as I am concerned,' Captain De Stancy's companion was saying,\n'nothing would give me more unfeigned delight than that you should\npersevere and win her. But you must understand that I have no authority\nover her--nothing more than the natural influence that arises from my\nbeing her father's brother.'\n\n'And for exercising that much, whatever it may be, in my favour I thank\nyou heartily,' said De Stancy. 'But I am coming to the conclusion that\nit is useless to press her further. She is right! I am not the man for\nher. I am too old, and too poor; and I must put up as well as I can with\nher loss--drown her image in old Falernian till I embark in Charon's\nboat for good!--Really, if I had the industry I could write some good\nHoratian verses on my inauspicious situation!... Ah, well;--in this way\nI affect levity over my troubles; but in plain truth my life will not be\nthe brightest without her.'\n\n'Don't be down-hearted! you are too--too gentlemanly, De Stancy, in\nthis matter--you are too soon put off--you should have a touch of the\ncanvasser about you in approaching her; and not stick at things. You\nhave my hearty invitation to travel with us all the way till we cross to\nEngland, and there will be heaps of opportunities as we wander on. I'll\nkeep a slow pace to give you time.'\n\n'You are very good, my friend! Well, I will try again. I am full of\ndoubt and indecision, mind, but at present I feel that I will try again.\nThere is, I suppose, a slight possibility of something or other turning\nup in my favour, if it is true that the unexpected always happens--for\nI foresee no chance whatever.... Which way do we go when we leave here\nto-morrow?'\n\n'To Carlsruhe, she says, if the rest of us have no objection.'\n\n'Carlsruhe, then, let it be, with all my heart; or anywhere.'\n\nTo Carlsruhe they went next day, after a night of soft rain which\nbrought up a warm steam from the Schwarzwald valleys, and caused the\nyoung tufts and grasses to swell visibly in a few hours. After the\nBaden slopes the flat thoroughfares of 'Charles's Rest' seemed somewhat\nuninteresting, though a busy fair which was proceeding in the\nstreets created a quaint and unexpected liveliness. On reaching the\nold-fashioned inn in the Lange-Strasse that they had fixed on, the\nwomen of the party betook themselves to their rooms and showed little\ninclination to see more of the world that day than could be gleaned from\nthe hotel windows.\n\n\n\nIII.\n\nWhile the malignant tongues had been playing havoc with Somerset's\nfame in the ears of Paula and her companion, the young man himself was\nproceeding partly by rail, partly on foot, below and amid the olive-clad\nhills, vineyards, carob groves, and lemon gardens of the Mediterranean\nshores. Arrived at San Remo he wrote to Nice to inquire for letters,\nand such as had come were duly forwarded; but not one of them was from\nPaula. This broke down his resolution to hold off, and he hastened\ndirectly to Genoa, regretting that he had not taken this step when he\nfirst heard that she was there.\n\nSomething in the very aspect of the marble halls of that city, which at\nany other time he would have liked to linger over, whispered to him that\nthe bird had flown; and inquiry confirmed the fancy. Nevertheless, the\narchitectural beauties of the palace-bordered street, looking as if\nmountains of marble must have been levelled to supply the materials\nfor constructing it, detained him there two days: or rather a feat\nof resolution, by which he set himself to withstand the drag-chain of\nPaula's influence, was operative for that space of time.\n\nAt the end of it he moved onward. There was no difficulty in discovering\ntheir track northwards; and feeling that he might as well return to\nEngland by the Rhine route as by any other, he followed in the course\nthey had chosen, getting scent of them in Strassburg, missing them at\nBaden by a day, and finally overtaking them at Carlsruhe, which town he\nreached on the morning after the Power and De Stancy party had taken\nup their quarters at the ancient inn above mentioned. When Somerset\nwas about to get out of the train at this place, little dreaming what\na meaning the word Carlsruhe would have for him in subsequent years, he\nwas disagreeably surprised to see no other than Dare stepping out of the\nadjoining carriage. A new brown leather valise in one of his hands, a\nnew umbrella in the other, and a new suit of fashionable clothes on\nhis back, seemed to denote considerable improvement in the young man's\nfortunes. Somerset was so struck by the circumstance of his being on\nthis spot that he almost missed his opportunity for alighting.\n\nDare meanwhile had moved on without seeing his former employer, and\nSomerset resolved to take the chance that offered, and let him go. There\nwas something so mysterious in their common presence simultaneously\nat one place, five hundred miles from where they had last met, that\nhe exhausted conjecture on whether Dare's errand this way could have\nanything to do with his own, or whether their juxtaposition a second\ntime was the result of pure accident. Greatly as he would have liked\nto get this answered by a direct question to Dare himself, he did not\ncounteract his first instinct, and remained unseen.\n\nThey went out in different directions, when Somerset for the first time\nremembered that, in learning at Baden that the party had flitted towards\nCarlsruhe, he had taken no care to ascertain the name of the hotel\nthey were bound for. Carlsruhe was not a large place and the point was\nimmaterial, but the omission would necessitate a little inquiry. To\nfollow Dare on the chance of his having fixed upon the same quarters\nwas a course which did not commend itself. He resolved to get some lunch\nbefore proceeding with his business--or fatuity--of discovering the\nelusive lady, and drove off to a neighbouring tavern, which did not\nhappen to be, as he hoped it might, the one chosen by those who had\npreceded him.\n\nMeanwhile Dare, previously master of their plans, went straight to the\nhouse which sheltered them, and on entering under the archway from the\nLange-Strasse was saved the trouble of inquiring for Captain De Stancy\nby seeing him drinking bitters at a little table in the court. Had\nSomerset chosen this inn for his quarters instead of the one in the\nMarket-Place which he actually did choose, the three must inevitably\nhave met here at this moment, with some possibly striking dramatic\nresults; though what they would have been remains for ever hidden in the\ndarkness of the unfulfilled.\n\nDe Stancy jumped up from his chair, and went forward to the new-comer.\n'You are not long behind us, then,' he said, with laconic disquietude.\n'I thought you were going straight home?'\n\n'I was,' said Dare, 'but I have been blessed with what I may call a\nsmall competency since I saw you last. Of the two hundred francs you\ngave me I risked fifty at the tables, and I have multiplied them, how\nmany times do you think? More than four hundred times.'\n\nDe Stancy immediately looked grave. 'I wish you had lost them,' he said,\nwith as much feeling as could be shown in a place where strangers were\nhovering near.\n\n'Nonsense, captain! I have proceeded purely on a calculation of chances;\nand my calculations proved as true as I expected, notwithstanding a\nlittle in-and-out luck at first. Witness this as the result.' He smacked\nhis bag with his umbrella, and the chink of money resounded from within.\n'Just feel the weight of it!'\n\n'It is not necessary. I take your word.'\n\n'Shall I lend you five pounds?'\n\n'God forbid! As if that would repay me for what you have cost me! But\ncome, let's get out of this place to where we can talk more freely.' He\nput his hand through the young man's arm, and led him round the corner\nof the hotel towards the Schloss-Platz.\n\n'These runs of luck will be your ruin, as I have told you before,'\ncontinued Captain De Stancy. 'You will be for repeating and repeating\nyour experiments, and will end by blowing your brains out, as wiser\nheads than yours have done. I am glad you have come away, at any rate.\nWhy did you travel this way?'\n\n'Simply because I could afford it, of course.--But come, captain,\nsomething has ruffled you to-day. I thought you did not look in the best\ntemper the moment I saw you. Every sip you took of your pick-up as you\nsat there showed me something was wrong. Tell your worry!'\n\n'Pooh--I can tell you in two words,' said the captain satirically. 'Your\narrangement for my wealth and happiness--for I suppose you still claim\nit to be yours--has fallen through. The lady has announced to-day that\nshe means to send for Somerset instantly. She is coming to a personal\nexplanation with him. So woe to me--and in another sense, woe to you, as\nI have reason to fear.'\n\n'Send for him!' said Dare, with the stillness of complete abstraction.\n'Then he'll come.'\n\n'Well,' said De Stancy, looking him in the face. 'And does it make you\nfeel you had better be off? How about that telegram? Did he ask you to\nsend it, or did he not?'\n\n'One minute, or I shall be up such a tree as nobody ever saw the like\nof.'\n\n'Then what did you come here for?' burst out De Stancy. ''Tis my belief\nyou are no more than a--But I won't call you names; I'll tell you quite\nplainly that if there is anything wrong in that message to her--which\nI believe there is--no, I can't believe, though I fear it--you have the\nchance of appearing in drab clothes at the expense of the Government\nbefore the year is out, and I of being eternally disgraced!'\n\n'No, captain, you won't be disgraced. I am bad to beat, I can tell you.\nAnd come the worst luck, I don't say a word.'\n\n'But those letters pricked in your skin would say a good deal, it\nstrikes me.'\n\n'What! would they strip me?--but it is not coming to that. Look here,\nnow, I'll tell you the truth for once; though you don't believe me\ncapable of it. I DID concoct that telegram--and sent it; just as a\npractical joke; and many a worse one has been only laughed at by honest\nmen and officers. I could show you a bigger joke still--a joke of\njokes--on the same individual.'\n\nDare as he spoke put his hand into his breast-pocket, as if the said\njoke lay there; but after a moment he withdrew his hand empty, as he\ncontinued:\n\n'Having invented it I have done enough; I was going to explain it to\nyou, that you might carry it out. But you are so serious, that I will\nleave it alone. My second joke shall die with me.'\n\n'So much the better,' said De Stancy. 'I don't like your jokes, even\nthough they are not directed against myself. They express a kind of\nhumour which does not suit me.'\n\n'You may have reason to alter your mind,' said Dare carelessly. 'Your\nsuccess with your lady may depend on it. The truth is, captain, we\naristocrats must not take too high a tone. Our days as an independent\ndivision of society, which holds aloof from other sections, are past.\nThis has been my argument (in spite of my strong Norman feelings) ever\nsince I broached the subject of your marrying this girl, who represents\nboth intellect and wealth--all, in fact, except the historical prestige\nthat you represent. And we mustn't flinch at things. The case is even\nmore pressing than ordinary cases--owing to the odd fact that the\nrepresentative of the new blood who has come in our way actually lives\nin your own old house, and owns your own old lands. The ordinary reason\nfor such alliances is quintupled in our case. Do then just think and\nbe reasonable, before you talk tall about not liking my jokes, and all\nthat. Beggars mustn't be choosers.'\n\n'There's really much reason in your argument,' said De Stancy, with a\nbitter laugh: 'and my own heart argues much the same way. But, leaving\nme to take care of my aristocratic self, I advise your aristocratic\nself to slip off at once to England like any hang-gallows dog; and if\nSomerset is here, and you have been doing wrong in his name, and it all\ncomes out, I'll try to save you, as far as an honest man can. If you\nhave done no wrong, of course there is no fear; though I should be\nobliged by your going homeward as quickly as possible, as being better\nboth for you and for me.... Hullo--Damnation!'\n\nThey had reached one side of the Schloss-Platz, nobody apparently being\nnear them save a sentinel who was on duty before the Palace; but turning\nas he spoke, De Stancy beheld a group consisting of his sister, Paula,\nand Mr. Power, strolling across the square towards them.\n\nIt was impossible to escape their observation, and putting a bold front\nupon it, De Stancy advanced with Dare at his side, till in a few moments\nthe two parties met, Paula and Charlotte recognizing Dare at once as the\nyoung man who assisted at the castle.\n\n'I have met my young photographer,' said De Stancy cheerily. 'What a\nsmall world it is, as everybody truly observes! I am wishing he could\ntake some views for us as we go on; but you have no apparatus with you,\nI suppose, Mr. Dare?'\n\n'I have not, sir, I am sorry to say,' replied Dare respectfully.\n\n'You could get some, I suppose?' asked Paula of the interesting young\nphotographer.\n\nDare declared that it would be not impossible: whereupon De Stancy said\nthat it was only a passing thought of his; and in a few minutes the two\nparties again separated, going their several ways.\n\n'That was awkward,' said De Stancy, trembling with excitement. 'I would\nadvise you to keep further off in future.'\n\nDare said thoughtfully that he would be careful, adding, 'She is a prize\nfor any man, indeed, leaving alone the substantial possessions behind\nher! Now was I too enthusiastic? Was I a fool for urging you on?'\n\n'Wait till success justifies the undertaking. In case of failure it will\nhave been anything but wise. It is no light matter to have a carefully\npreserved repose broken in upon for nothing--a repose that could never\nbe restored!'\n\nThey walked down the Carl-Friedrichs-Strasse to the Margrave's Pyramid,\nand back to the hotel, where Dare also decided to take up his stay. De\nStancy left him with the book-keeper at the desk, and went upstairs to\nsee if the ladies had returned.\n\n\n\nIV.\n\nHe found them in their sitting-room with their bonnets on, as if they\nhad just come in. Mr. Power was also present, reading a newspaper, but\nMrs. Goodman had gone out to a neighbouring shop, in the windows of\nwhich she had seen something which attracted her fancy.\n\nWhen De Stancy entered, Paula's thoughts seemed to revert to Dare, for\nalmost at once she asked him in what direction the youth was travelling.\nWith some hesitation De Stancy replied that he believed Mr. Dare was\nreturning to England after a spring trip for the improvement of his\nmind.\n\n'A very praiseworthy thing to do,' said Paula. 'What places has he\nvisited?'\n\n'Those which afford opportunities for the study of the old masters, I\nbelieve,' said De Stancy blandly. 'He has also been to Turin, Genoa,\nMarseilles, and so on.' The captain spoke the more readily to her\nquestioning in that he divined her words to be dictated, not by any\nsuspicions of his relations with Dare, but by her knowledge of Dare as\nthe draughtsman employed by Somerset.\n\n'Has he been to Nice?' she next demanded. 'Did he go there in company\nwith my architect?'\n\n'I think not.'\n\n'Has he seen anything of him? My architect Somerset once employed him.\nThey know each other.'\n\n'I think he saw Somerset for a short time.'\n\nPaula was silent. 'Do you know where this young man Dare is at the\npresent moment?' she asked quickly.\n\nDe Stancy said that Dare was staying at the same hotel with themselves,\nand that he believed he was downstairs.\n\n'I think I can do no better than send for him,' said she. 'He may be\nable to throw some light upon the matter of that telegram.'\n\nShe rang and despatched the waiter for the young man in question, De\nStancy almost visibly trembling for the result. But he opened the town\ndirectory which was lying on a table, and affected to be engrossed in\nthe names.\n\nBefore Dare was shown in she said to her uncle, 'Perhaps you will speak\nto him for me?'\n\nMr. Power, looking up from the paper he was reading, assented to her\nproposition. Dare appeared in the doorway, and the waiter retired. Dare\nseemed a trifle startled out of his usual coolness, the message having\nevidently been unexpected, and he came forward somewhat uneasily.\n\n'Mr. Dare, we are anxious to know something of Miss Power's architect;\nand Captain De Stancy tells us you have seen him lately,' said Mr. Power\nsonorously over the edge of his newspaper.\n\nNot knowing whether danger menaced or no, or, if it menaced, from what\nquarter it was to be expected, Dare felt that honesty was as good as\nanything else for him, and replied boldly that he had seen Mr. Somerset,\nDe Stancy continuing to cream and mantle almost visibly, in anxiety at\nthe situation of the speaker.\n\n'And where did you see him?' continued Mr. Power.\n\n'In the Casino at Monte Carlo.'\n\n'How long did you see him?'\n\n'Only for half an hour. I left him there.'\n\nPaula's interest got the better of her reserve, and she cut in upon her\nuncle: 'Did he seem in any unusual state, or in trouble?'\n\n'He was rather excited,' said Dare.\n\n'And can you remember when that was?'\n\nDare considered, looked at his pocket-book, and said that it was on the\nevening of April the twenty-second.\n\nThe answer had a significance for Paula, De Stancy, and Charlotte, to\nwhich Abner Power was a stranger. The telegraphic request for money,\nwhich had been kept a secret from him by his niece, because of his\nalready unfriendly tone towards Somerset, arrived on the morning of the\ntwenty-third--a date which neighboured with painfully suggestive nicety\nupon that now given by Dare.\n\nShe seemed to be silenced, and asked no more questions. Dare having\nfurbished himself up to a gentlemanly appearance with some of his recent\nwinnings, was invited to stay on awhile by Paula's uncle, who, as became\na travelled man, was not fastidious as to company. Being a youth of the\nworld, Dare made himself agreeable to that gentleman, and afterwards\ntried to do the same with Miss De Stancy. At this the captain, to whom\nthe situation for some time had been amazingly uncomfortable, pleaded\nsome excuse for going out, and left the room.\n\nDare continued his endeavours to say a few polite nothings to Charlotte\nDe Stancy, in the course of which he drew from his pocket his new silk\nhandkerchief. By some chance a card came out with the handkerchief, and\nfluttered downwards. His momentary instinct was to make a grasp at the\ncard and conceal it: but it had already tumbled to the floor, where it\nlay face upward beside Charlotte De Stancy's chair.\n\nIt was neither a visiting nor a playing card, but one bearing a\nphotographic portrait of a peculiar nature. It was what Dare had\ncharacterized as his best joke in speaking on the subject to Captain De\nStancy: he had in the morning put it ready in his pocket to give to the\ncaptain, and had in fact held it in waiting between his finger and thumb\nwhile talking to him in the Platz, meaning that he should make use of it\nagainst his rival whenever convenient. But his sharp conversation with\nthat soldier had dulled his zest for this final joke at Somerset's\nexpense, had at least shown him that De Stancy would not adopt the joke\nby accepting the photograph and using it himself, and determined him to\nlay it aside till a more convenient time. So fully had he made up his\nmind on this course, that when the photograph slipped out he did not at\nfirst perceive the appositeness of the circumstance, in putting into his\nown hands the role he had intended for De Stancy; though it was asserted\nafterwards that the whole scene was deliberately planned. However, once\nhaving seen the accident, he resolved to take the current as it served.\n\nThe card having fallen beside her, Miss De Stancy glanced over it, which\nindeed she could not help doing. The smile that had previously hung upon\nher lips was arrested as if by frost and she involuntarily uttered a\nlittle distressed cry of 'O!' like one in bodily pain.\n\nPaula, who had been talking to her uncle during this interlude, started\nround, and wondering what had happened, inquiringly crossed the room\nto poor Charlotte's side, asking her what was the matter. Charlotte had\nregained self-possession, though not enough to enable her to reply, and\nPaula asked her a second time what had made her exclaim like that. Miss\nDe Stancy still seemed confused, whereupon Paula noticed that her eyes\nwere continually drawn as if by fascination towards the photograph on\nthe floor, which, contrary to his first impulse, Dare, as has been\nsaid, now seemed in no hurry to regain. Surmising at last that the card,\nwhatever it was, had something to do with the exclamation, Paula picked\nit up.\n\nIt was a portrait of Somerset; but by a device known in photography\nthe operator, though contriving to produce what seemed to be a perfect\nlikeness, had given it the distorted features and wild attitude of a man\nadvanced in intoxication. No woman, unless specially cognizant of such\npossibilities, could have looked upon it and doubted that the photograph\nwas a genuine illustration of a customary phase in the young man's\nprivate life.\n\nPaula observed it, thoroughly took it in; but the effect upon her was by\nno means clear. Charlotte's eyes at once forsook the portrait to dwell\non Paula's face. It paled a little, and this was followed by a hot\nblush--perceptibly a blush of shame. That was all. She flung the picture\ndown on the table, and moved away.\n\nIt was now Mr. Power's turn. Anticipating Dare, who was advancing with\na deprecatory look to seize the photograph, he also grasped it. When he\nsaw whom it represented he seemed both amused and startled, and after\nscanning it a while handed it to the young man with a queer smile.\n\n'I am very sorry,' began Dare in a low voice to Mr. Power. 'I fear I was\nto blame for thoughtlessness in not destroying it. But I thought it was\nrather funny that a man should permit such a thing to be done, and that\nthe humour would redeem the offence.'\n\n'In you, for purchasing it,' said Paula with haughty quickness from the\nother side of the room. 'Though probably his friends, if he has any,\nwould say not in him.'\n\nThere was silence in the room after this, and Dare, finding himself\nrather in the way, took his leave as unostentatiously as a cat that has\nupset the family china, though he continued to say among his apologies\nthat he was not aware Mr. Somerset was a personal friend of the ladies.\n\nOf all the thoughts which filled the minds of Paula and Charlotte De\nStancy, the thought that the photograph might have been a fabrication\nwas probably the last. To them that picture of Somerset had all the\ncogency of direct vision. Paula's experience, much less Charlotte's, had\nnever lain in the fields of heliographic science, and they would as soon\nhave thought that the sun could again stand still upon Gibeon, as\nthat it could be made to falsify men's characters in delineating their\nfeatures. What Abner Power thought he himself best knew. He might have\nseen such pictures before; or he might never have heard of them.\n\nWhile pretending to resume his reading he closely observed Paula, as did\nalso Charlotte De Stancy; but thanks to the self-management which\nwas Miss Power's as much by nature as by art, she dissembled whatever\nemotion was in her.\n\n'It is a pity a professional man should make himself so ludicrous,' she\nsaid with such careless intonation that it was almost impossible,\neven for Charlotte, who knew her so well, to believe her indifference\nfeigned.\n\n'Yes,' said Mr. Power, since Charlotte did not speak: 'it is what I\nscarcely should have expected.'\n\n'O, I am not surprised!' said Paula quickly. 'You don't know all.' The\ninference was, indeed, inevitable that if her uncle were made aware of\nthe telegram he would see nothing unlikely in the picture. 'Well, you\nare very silent!' continued Paula petulantly, when she found that nobody\nwent on talking. 'What made you cry out \"O,\" Charlotte, when Mr. Dare\ndropped that horrid photograph?'\n\n'I don't know; I suppose it frightened me,' stammered the girl.\n\n'It was a stupid fuss to make before such a person. One would think you\nwere in love with Mr. Somerset.'\n\n'What did you say, Paula?' inquired her uncle, looking up from the\nnewspaper which he had again resumed.\n\n'Nothing, Uncle Abner.' She walked to the window, and, as if to tide\nover what was plainly passing in their minds about her, she began to\nmake remarks on objects in the street. 'What a quaint being--look,\nCharlotte!' It was an old woman sitting by a stall on the opposite side\nof the way, which seemed suddenly to hit Paula's sense of the humorous,\nthough beyond the fact that the dame was old and poor, and wore a white\nhandkerchief over her head, there was really nothing noteworthy about\nher.\n\nPaula seemed to be more hurt by what the silence of her companions\nimplied--a suspicion that the discovery of Somerset's depravity was\nwounding her heart--than by the wound itself. The ostensible ease with\nwhich she drew them into a bye conversation had perhaps the defect\nof proving too much: though her tacit contention that no love was in\nquestion was not incredible on the supposition that affronted pride\nalone caused her embarrassment. The chief symptom of her heart being\nreally tender towards Somerset consisted in her apparent blindness to\nCharlotte's secret, so obviously suggested by her momentary agitation.\n\n\n\nV.\n\nAnd where was the subject of their condemnatory opinions all this\nwhile? Having secured a room at his inn, he came forth to complete the\ndiscovery of his dear mistress's halting-place without delay. After\none or two inquiries he ascertained where such a party of English were\nstaying; and arriving at the hotel, knew at once that he had tracked\nthem to earth by seeing the heavier portion of the Power luggage\nconfronting him in the hall. He sent up intelligence of his presence,\nand awaited her reply with a beating heart.\n\nIn the meanwhile Dare, descending from his pernicious interview with\nPaula and the rest, had descried Captain De Stancy in the public\ndrawing-room, and entered to him forthwith. It was while they were here\ntogether that Somerset passed the door and sent up his name to Paula.\n\nThe incident at the railway station was now reversed, Somerset being\nthe observed of Dare, as Dare had then been the observed of Somerset.\nImmediately on sight of him Dare showed real alarm. He had imagined that\nSomerset would eventually impinge on Paula's route, but he had scarcely\nexpected it yet; and the architect's sudden appearance led Dare to\nask himself the ominous question whether Somerset had discovered his\ntelegraphic trick, and was in the mood for prompt measures.\n\n'There is no more for me to do here,' said the boy hastily to De Stancy.\n'Miss Power does not wish to ask me any more questions. I may as well\nproceed on my way, as you advised.'\n\nDe Stancy, who had also gazed with dismay at Somerset's passing figure,\nthough with dismay of another sort, was recalled from his vexation by\nDare's remarks, and turning upon him he said sharply, 'Well may you be\nin such a hurry all of a sudden!'\n\n'True, I am superfluous now.'\n\n'You have been doing a foolish thing, and you must suffer its\ninconveniences.--Will, I am sorry for one thing; I am sorry I ever\nowned you; for you are not a lad to my heart. You have disappointed\nme--disappointed me almost beyond endurance.'\n\n'I have acted according to my illumination. What can you expect of a man\nborn to dishonour?'\n\n'That's mere speciousness. Before you knew anything of me, and while\nyou thought you were the child of poverty on both sides, you were well\nenough; but ever since you thought you were more than that, you have led\na life which is intolerable. What has become of your plan of alliance\nbetween the De Stancys and the Powers now? The man is gone upstairs who\ncan overthrow it all.'\n\n'If the man had not gone upstairs, you wouldn't have complained of my\nnature or my plans,' said Dare drily. 'If I mistake not, he will come\ndown again with the flea in his ear. However, I have done; my play is\nplayed out. All the rest remains with you. But, captain, grant me this!\nIf when I am gone this difficulty should vanish, and things should go\nwell with you, and your suit should prosper, will you think of him, bad\nas he is, who first put you on the track of such happiness, and let him\nknow it was not done in vain?'\n\n'I will,' said De Stancy. 'Promise me that you will be a better boy?'\n\n'Very well--as soon as ever I can afford it. Now I am up and away, when\nI have explained to them that I shall not require my room.'\n\nDare fetched his bag, touched his hat with his umbrella to the captain\nand went out of the hotel archway. De Stancy sat down in the stuffy\ndrawing-room, and wondered what other ironies time had in store for him.\n\nA waiter in the interim had announced Somerset to the group upstairs.\nPaula started as much as Charlotte at hearing the name, and Abner Power\nstared at them both.\n\n'If Mr. Somerset wishes to see me ON BUSINESS, show him in,' said Paula.\n\nIn a few seconds the door was thrown open for Somerset. On receipt of\nthe pointed message he guessed that a change had come. Time, absence,\nambition, her uncle's influence, and a new wooer, seemed to account\nsufficiently well for that change, and he accepted his fate. But a\nstoical instinct to show her that he could regard vicissitudes with the\nequanimity that became a man; a desire to ease her mind of any fear\nshe might entertain that his connection with her past would render him\ntroublesome in future, induced him to accept her permission, and see the\nact to the end.\n\n'How do you do, Mr. Somerset?' said Abner Power, with sardonic\ngeniality: he had been far enough about the world not to be greatly\nconcerned at Somerset's apparent failing, particularly when it helped to\nreduce him from the rank of lover to his niece to that of professional\nadviser.\n\nMiss De Stancy faltered a welcome as weak as that of the Maid of\nNeidpath, and Paula said coldly, 'We are rather surprised to see you.\nPerhaps there is something urgent at the castle which makes it necessary\nfor you to call?'\n\n'There is something a little urgent,' said Somerset slowly, as he\napproached her; 'and you have judged rightly that it is the cause of\nmy call.' He sat down near her chair as he spoke, put down his hat, and\ndrew a note-book from his pocket with a despairing sang froid that was\nfar more perfect than had been Paula's demeanour just before.\n\n'Perhaps you would like to talk over the business with Mr. Somerset\nalone?' murmured Charlotte to Miss Power, hardly knowing what she said.\n\n'O no,' said Paula, 'I think not. Is it necessary?' she said, turning to\nhim.\n\n'Not in the least,' replied he, bestowing a penetrating glance upon\nhis questioner's face, which seemed however to produce no effect; and\nturning towards Charlotte, he added, 'You will have the goodness, I am\nsure, Miss De Stancy, to excuse the jargon of professional details.'\n\nHe spread some tracings on the table, and pointed out certain modified\nfeatures to Paula, commenting as he went on, and exchanging occasionally\na few words on the subject with Mr. Abner Power by the distant window.\n\nIn this architectural dialogue over his sketches, Somerset's head and\nPaula's became unavoidably very close. The temptation was too much for\nthe young man. Under cover of the rustle of the tracings, he murmured,\n'Paula, I could not get here before!' in a low voice inaudible to the\nother two.\n\nShe did not reply, only busying herself the more with the notes and\nsketches; and he said again, 'I stayed a couple of days at Genoa, and\nsome days at San Remo, and Mentone.'\n\n'But it is not the least concern of mine where you stayed, is it?' she\nsaid, with a cold yet disquieted look.\n\n'Do you speak seriously?' Somerset brokenly whispered.\n\nPaula concluded her examination of the drawings and turned from him with\nsorrowful disregard. He tried no further, but, when she had signified\nher pleasure on the points submitted, packed up his papers, and rose\nwith the bearing of a man altogether superior to such a class of\nmisfortune as this. Before going he turned to speak a few words of a\ngeneral kind to Mr. Power and Charlotte.\n\n'You will stay and dine with us?' said the former, rather with the air\nof being unhappily able to do no less than ask the question. 'My charges\nhere won't go down to the table-d'hote, I fear, but De Stancy and myself\nwill be there.'\n\nSomerset excused himself, and in a few minutes withdrew. At the door\nhe looked round for an instant, and his eyes met Paula's. There was the\nsame miles-off expression in hers that they had worn when he entered;\nbut there was also a look of distressful inquiry, as if she were\nearnestly expecting him to say something more. This of course Somerset\ndid not comprehend. Possibly she was clinging to a hope of some excuse\nfor the message he was supposed to have sent, or for the other and more\ndegrading matter. Anyhow, Somerset only bowed and went away.\n\nA moment after he had gone, Paula, impelled by something or other,\ncrossed the room to the window. In a short time she saw his form in the\nbroad street below, which he traversed obliquely to an opposite corner,\nhis head somewhat bent, and his eyes on the ground. Before vanishing\ninto the Ritterstrasse he turned his head and glanced at the hotel\nwindows, as if he knew that she was watching him. Then he disappeared;\nand the only real sign of emotion betrayed by Paula during the whole\nepisode escaped her at this moment. It was a slight trembling of the lip\nand a sigh so slowly breathed that scarce anybody could hear--scarcely\neven Charlotte, who was reclining on a couch her face on her hand and\nher eyes downcast.\n\nNot more than two minutes had elapsed when Mrs. Goodman came in with a\nmanner of haste.\n\n'You have returned,' said Mr. Power. 'Have you made your purchases?'\n\nWithout answering, she asked, 'Whom, of all people on earth, do you\nthink I have met? Mr. Somerset! Has he been here?--he passed me almost\nwithout speaking!'\n\n'Yes, he has been here,' said Paula. 'He is on the way from Genoa home,\nand called on business.'\n\n'You will have him here to dinner, of course?'\n\n'I asked him,' said Mr. Power, 'but he declined.'\n\n'O, that's unfortunate! Surely we could get him to come. You would like\nto have him here, would you not, Paula?'\n\n'No, indeed. I don't want him here,' said she.\n\n'You don't?'\n\n'No!' she said sharply.\n\n'You used to like him well enough, anyhow,' bluntly rejoined Mrs.\nGoodman.\n\nPaula sedately: 'It is a mistake to suppose that I ever particularly\nliked the gentleman mentioned.'\n\n'Then you are wrong, Mrs. Goodman, it seems,' said Mr. Power.\n\nMrs. Goodman, who had been growing quietly indignant, notwithstanding\na vigorous use of her fan, at this said. 'Fie, fie, Paula! you did like\nhim. You said to me only a week or two ago that you should not at all\nobject to marry him.'\n\n'It is a mistake,' repeated Paula calmly. 'I meant the other one of the\ntwo we were talking about.'\n\n'What, Captain De Stancy?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\nKnowing this to be a fiction, Mrs. Goodman made no remark, and hearing\na slight noise behind, turned her head. Seeing her aunt's action,\nPaula also looked round. The door had been left ajar, and De Stancy was\nstanding in the room. The last words of Mrs. Goodman, and Paula's reply,\nmust have been quite audible to him.\n\nThey looked at each other much as if they had unexpectedly met at\nthe altar; but after a momentary start Paula did not flinch from\nthe position into which hurt pride had betrayed her. De Stancy bowed\ngracefully, and she merely walked to the furthest window, whither he\nfollowed her.\n\n'I am eternally grateful to you for avowing that I have won favour in\nyour sight at last,' he whispered.\n\nShe acknowledged the remark with a somewhat reserved bearing. 'Really\nI don't deserve your gratitude,' she said. 'I did not know you were\nthere.'\n\n'I know you did not--that's why the avowal is so sweet to me. Can I take\nyou at your word?'\n\n'Yes, I suppose.'\n\n'Then your preference is the greatest honour that has ever fallen to my\nlot. It is enough: you accept me?'\n\n'As a lover on probation--no more.'\n\nThe conversation being carried on in low tones, Paula's uncle and aunt\ntook it as a hint that their presence could be spared, and severally\nleft the room--the former gladly, the latter with some vexation.\nCharlotte De Stancy followed.\n\n'And to what am I indebted for this happy change?' inquired De Stancy,\nas soon as they were alone.\n\n'You shouldn't look a gift-horse in the mouth,' she replied brusquely,\nand with tears in her eyes for one gone.\n\n'You mistake my motive. I am like a reprieved criminal, and can scarcely\nbelieve the news.'\n\n'You shouldn't say that to me, or I shall begin to think I have been too\nkind,' she answered, some of the archness of her manner returning. 'Now,\nI know what you mean to say in answer; but I don't want to hear more at\npresent; and whatever you do, don't fall into the mistake of supposing\nI have accepted you in any other sense than the way I say. If you don't\nlike such a limitation you can go away. I dare say I shall get over it.'\n\n'Go away! Could I go away?--But you are beginning to tease, and will\nsoon punish me severely; so I will make my escape while all is well. It\nwould be presumptuous to expect more in one day.'\n\n'It would indeed,' said Paula, with her eyes on a bunch of flowers.\n\n\n\nVI.\n\nOn leaving the hotel, Somerset's first impulse was to get out of\nsight of its windows, and his glance upward had perhaps not the tender\nsignificance that Paula imagined, the last look impelled by any such\nwhiff of emotion having been the lingering one he bestowed upon her in\npassing out of the room. Unluckily for the prospects of this attachment,\nPaula's conduct towards him now, as a result of misrepresentation,\nhad enough in common with her previous silence at Nice to make it not\nunreasonable as a further development of that silence. Moreover, her\nsocial position as a woman of wealth, always felt by Somerset as a\nperceptible bar to that full and free eagerness with which he would fain\nhave approached her, rendered it impossible for him to return to the\ncharge, ascertain the reason of her coldness, and dispel it by an\nexplanation, without being suspected of mercenary objects. Continually\ndoes it happen that a genial willingness to bottle up affronts is\nset down to interested motives by those who do not know what generous\nconduct means. Had she occupied the financial position of Miss De\nStancy he would readily have persisted further and, not improbably, have\ncleared up the cloud.\n\nHaving no further interest in Carlsruhe, Somerset decided to leave by an\nevening train. The intervening hour he spent in wandering into the thick\nof the fair, where steam roundabouts, the proprietors of wax-work\nshows, and fancy-stall keepers maintained a deafening din. The\nanimated environment was better than silence, for it fostered in him\nan artificial indifference to the events that had just happened--an\nindifference which, though he too well knew it was only destined to be\ntemporary, afforded a passive period wherein to store up strength that\nshould enable him to withstand the wear and tear of regrets which would\nsurely set in soon. It was the case with Somerset as with others of his\ntemperament, that he did not feel a blow of this sort immediately; and\nwhat often seemed like stoicism after misfortune was only the neutral\nnumbness of transition from palpitating hope to assured wretchedness.\n\nHe walked round and round the fair till all the exhibitors knew him by\nsight, and when the sun got low he turned into the Erbprinzen-Strasse,\nnow raked from end to end by ensaffroned rays of level light. Seeking\nhis hotel he dined there, and left by the evening train for Heidelberg.\n\n\n\nHeidelberg with its romantic surroundings was not precisely the place\ncalculated to heal Somerset's wounded heart. He had known the town of\nyore, and his recollections of that period, when, unfettered in fancy,\nhe had transferred to his sketch-book the fine Renaissance details of\nthe Otto-Heinrichs-Bau came back with unpleasant force. He knew of some\ncarved cask-heads and other curious wood-work in the castle cellars,\ncopies of which, being unobtainable by photographs, he had intended to\nmake if all went well between Paula and himself. The zest for this was\nnow well-nigh over. But on awaking in the morning and looking up\nthe valley towards the castle, and at the dark green height of the\nKonigsstuhl alongside, he felt that to become vanquished by a passion,\ndriven to suffer, fast, and pray in the dull pains and vapours of\ndespised love, was a contingency not to be welcomed too readily.\nThereupon he set himself to learn the sad science of renunciation, which\neverybody has to learn in his degree--either rebelling throughout the\nlesson, or, like Somerset, taking to it kindly by force of judgment.\nA more obstinate pupil might have altogether escaped the lesson in the\npresent case by discovering its illegality.\n\nResolving to persevere in the heretofore satisfactory paths of art while\nlife and faculties were left, though every instinct must proclaim that\nthere would be no longer any collateral attraction in that pursuit, he\nwent along under the trees of the Anlage and reached the castle vaults,\nin whose cool shades he spent the afternoon, working out his intentions\nwith fair result. When he had strolled back to his hotel in the evening\nthe time was approaching for the table-d'hote. Having seated himself\nrather early, he spent the few minutes of waiting in looking over\nhis pocket-book, and putting a few finishing touches to the afternoon\nperformance whilst the objects were fresh in his memory. Thus occupied\nhe was but dimly conscious of the customary rustle of dresses and\npulling up of chairs by the crowd of other diners as they gathered\naround him. Serving began, and he put away his book and prepared for the\nmeal. He had hardly done this when he became conscious that the person\non his left hand was not the typical cosmopolite with boundless hotel\nknowledge and irrelevant experiences that he was accustomed to find next\nhim, but a face he recognized as that of a young man whom he had met\nand talked to at Stancy Castle garden-party, whose name he had now\nforgotten. This young fellow was conversing with somebody on his left\nhand--no other personage than Paula herself. Next to Paula he beheld\nDe Stancy, and De Stancy's sister beyond him. It was one of those\ngratuitous encounters which only happen to discarded lovers who have\nshown commendable stoicism under disappointment, as if on purpose to\nreopen and aggravate their wounds.\n\nIt seemed as if the intervening traveller had met the other party by\naccident there and then. In a minute he turned and recognized Somerset,\nand by degrees the young men's cursory remarks to each other developed\ninto a pretty regular conversation, interrupted only when he turned to\nspeak to Paula on his left hand.\n\n'Your architectural adviser travels in your party: how very convenient,'\nsaid the young tourist to her. 'Far pleasanter than having a medical\nattendant in one's train!'\n\nSomerset, who had no distractions on the other side of him, could\nhear every word of this. He glanced at Paula. She had not known of his\npresence in the room till now. Their eyes met for a second, and she\nbowed sedately. Somerset returned her bow, and her eyes were quickly\nwithdrawn with scarcely visible confusion.\n\n'Mr. Somerset is not travelling with us,' she said. 'We have met by\naccident. Mr. Somerset came to me on business a little while ago.'\n\n'I must congratulate you on having put the castle into good hands,'\ncontinued the enthusiastic young man.\n\n'I believe Mr. Somerset is quite competent,' said Paula stiffly.\n\nTo include Somerset in the conversation the young man turned to him and\nadded: 'You carry on your work at the castle con amore, no doubt?'\n\n'There is work I should like better,' said Somerset.\n\n'Indeed?'\n\nThe frigidity of his manner seemed to set her at ease by dispersing all\nfear of a scene; and alternate dialogues of this sort with the gentleman\nin their midst were more or less continued by both Paula and Somerset\ntill they rose from table.\n\nIn the bustle of moving out the two latter for one moment stood side by\nside.\n\n'Miss Power,' said Somerset, in a low voice that was obscured by the\nrustle, 'you have nothing more to say to me?'\n\n'I think there is nothing more?' said Paula, lifting her eyes with\nlonging reticence.\n\n'Then I take leave of you; and tender my best wishes that you may have a\npleasant time before you!.... I set out for England to-night.'\n\n'With a special photographer, no doubt?'\n\nIt was the first time that she had addressed Somerset with a meaning\ndistinctly bitter; and her remark, which had reference to the forged\nphotograph, fell of course without its intended effect.\n\n'No, Miss Power,' said Somerset gravely. 'But with a deeper sense of\nwoman's thoughtless trifling than time will ever eradicate.'\n\n'Is not that a mistake?' she asked in a voice that distinctly trembled.\n\n'A mistake? How?'\n\n'I mean, do you not forget many things?' (throwing on him a troubled\nglance). 'A woman may feel herself justified in her conduct, although it\nadmits of no explanation.'\n\n'I don't contest the point for a moment.... Goodbye.'\n\n'Good-bye.'\n\nThey parted amid the flowering shrubs and caged birds in the hall,\nand he saw her no more. De Stancy came up, and spoke a few commonplace\nwords, his sister having gone out, either without perceiving Somerset,\nor with intention to avoid him.\n\nThat night, as he had said, he was on his way to England.\n\n\n\nVII.\n\nThe De Stancys and Powers remained in Heidelberg for some days. All\nremarked that after Somerset's departure Paula was frequently irritable,\nthough at other times as serene as ever. Yet even when in a blithe and\nsaucy mood there was at bottom a tinge of melancholy. Something did not\nlie easy in her undemonstrative heart, and all her friends excused the\ninequalities of a humour whose source, though not positively known,\ncould be fairly well guessed.\n\nDe Stancy had long since discovered that his chance lay chiefly in\nher recently acquired and fanciful predilection d'artiste for hoary\nmediaeval families with ancestors in alabaster and primogenitive renown.\nSeeing this he dwelt on those topics which brought out that aspect of\nhimself more clearly, talking feudalism and chivalry with a zest that\nhe had never hitherto shown. Yet it was not altogether factitious.\nFor, discovering how much this quondam Puritan was interested in the\nattributes of long-chronicled houses, a reflected interest in himself\narose in his own soul, and he began to wonder why he had not prized\nthese things before. Till now disgusted by the failure of his family to\nhold its own in the turmoil between ancient and modern, he had grown to\nundervalue its past prestige; and it was with corrective ardour that he\nadopted while he ministered to her views.\n\nHenceforward the wooing of De Stancy took the form of an intermittent\naddress, the incidents of their travel furnishing pegs whereon to hang\nhis subject; sometimes hindering it, but seldom failing to produce in\nher a greater tolerance of his presence. His next opportunity was the\nday after Somerset's departure from Heidelberg. They stood on the great\nterrace of the Schloss-Garten, looking across the intervening ravine\nto the north-east front of the castle which rose before them in all its\ncustomary warm tints and battered magnificence.\n\n'This is a spot, if any, which should bring matters to a crisis between\nyou and me,' he asserted good-humouredly. 'But you have been so silent\nto-day that I lose the spirit to take advantage of my privilege.'\n\nShe inquired what privilege he spoke of, as if quite another subject had\nbeen in her mind than De Stancy.\n\n'The privilege of winning your heart if I can, which you gave me at\nCarlsruhe.'\n\n'O,' she said. 'Well, I've been thinking of that. But I do not feel\nmyself absolutely bound by the statement I made in that room; and I\nshall expect, if I withdraw it, not to be called to account by you.'\n\nDe Stancy looked rather blank.\n\n'If you recede from your promise you will doubtless have good reason.\nBut I must solemnly beg you, after raising my hopes, to keep as near as\nyou can to your word, so as not to throw me into utter despair.'\n\nPaula dropped her glance into the Thier-Garten below them, where gay\npromenaders were clambering up between the bushes and flowers. At length\nshe said, with evident embarrassment, but with much distinctness: 'I\ndeserve much more blame for what I have done than you can express to me.\nI will confess to you the whole truth. All that I told you in the hotel\nat Carlsruhe was said in a moment of pique at what had happened just\nbefore you came in. It was supposed I was much involved with another\nman, and circumstances made the supposition particularly objectionable.\nTo escape it I jumped at the alternative of yourself.'\n\n'That's bad for me!' he murmured.\n\n'If after this avowal you bind me to my words I shall say no more: I do\nnot wish to recede from them without your full permission.'\n\n'What a caprice! But I release you unconditionally,' he said. 'And I beg\nyour pardon if I seemed to show too much assurance. Please put it down\nto my gratified excitement. I entirely acquiesce in your wish. I will go\naway to whatever place you please, and not come near you but by your own\npermission, and till you are quite satisfied that my presence and what\nit may lead to is not undesirable. I entirely give way before you, and\nwill endeavour to make my future devotedness, if ever we meet again, a\nnew ground for expecting your favour.'\n\nPaula seemed struck by the generous and cheerful fairness of his\nremarks, and said gently, 'Perhaps your departure is not absolutely\nnecessary for my happiness; and I do not wish from what you call\ncaprice--'\n\n'I retract that word.'\n\n'Well, whatever it is, I don't wish you to do anything which should\ncause you real pain, or trouble, or humiliation.'\n\n'That's very good of you.'\n\n'But I reserve to myself the right to accept or refuse your\naddresses--just as if those rash words of mine had never been spoken.'\n\n'I must bear it all as best I can, I suppose,' said De Stancy, with\nmelancholy humorousness.\n\n'And I shall treat you as your behaviour shall seem to deserve,' she\nsaid playfully.\n\n'Then I may stay?'\n\n'Yes; I am willing to give you that pleasure, if it is one, in return\nfor the attentions you have shown, and the trouble you have taken to\nmake my journey pleasant.'\n\nShe walked on and discovered Mrs. Goodman near, and presently the whole\nparty met together. De Stancy did not find himself again at her side\ntill later in the afternoon, when they had left the immediate precincts\nof the castle and decided on a drive to the Konigsstuhl.\n\nThe carriage, containing only Mrs. Goodman, was driven a short way up\nthe winding incline, Paula, her uncle, and Miss De Stancy walking behind\nunder the shadow of the trees. Then Mrs. Goodman called to them and\nasked when they were going to join her.\n\n'We are going to walk up,' said Mr. Power.\n\nPaula seemed seized with a spirit of boisterousness quite unlike her\nusual behaviour. 'My aunt may drive up, and you may walk up; but I\nshall run up,' she said. 'See, here's a way.' She tripped towards a path\nthrough the bushes which, instead of winding like the regular track,\nmade straight for the summit.\n\nPaula had not the remotest conception of the actual distance to the top,\nimagining it to be but a couple of hundred yards at the outside, whereas\nit was really nearer a mile, the ascent being uniformly steep all the\nway. When her uncle and De Stancy had seen her vanish they stood\nstill, the former evidently reluctant to forsake the easy ascent for a\ndifficult one, though he said, 'We can't let her go alone that way, I\nsuppose.'\n\n'No, of course not,' said De Stancy.\n\nThey then followed in the direction taken by Paula, Charlotte entering\nthe carriage. When Power and De Stancy had ascended about fifty yards\nthe former looked back, and dropped off from the pursuit, to return to\nthe easy route, giving his companion a parting hint concerning Paula.\nWhereupon De Stancy went on alone. He soon saw Paula above him in the\npath, which ascended skyward straight as Jacob's Ladder, but was so\noverhung by the brushwood as to be quite shut out from the sun. When he\nreached her side she was moving easily upward, apparently enjoying the\nseclusion which the place afforded.\n\n'Is not my uncle with you?' she said, on turning and seeing him.\n\n'He went back,' said De Stancy.\n\nShe replied that it was of no consequence; that she should meet him at\nthe top, she supposed.\n\nPaula looked up amid the green light which filtered through the leafage\nas far as her eyes could stretch. But the top did not appear, and she\nallowed De Stancy to get in front. 'It did not seem such a long way as\nthis, to look at,' she presently said.\n\nHe explained that the trees had deceived her as to the real height, by\nreason of her seeing the slope foreshortened when she looked up from the\ncastle. 'Allow me to help you,' he added.\n\n'No, thank you,' said Paula lightly; 'we must be near the top.'\n\nThey went on again; but no Konigsstuhl. When next De Stancy turned he\nfound that she was sitting down; immediately going back he offered his\narm. She took it in silence, declaring that it was no wonder her uncle\ndid not come that wearisome way, if he had ever been there before.\n\nDe Stancy did not explain that Mr. Power had said to him at parting,\n'There's a chance for you, if you want one,' but at once went on with\nthe subject begun on the terrace. 'If my behaviour is good, you will\nreaffirm the statement made at Carlsruhe?'\n\n'It is not fair to begin that now!' expostulated Paula; 'I can only\nthink of getting to the top.'\n\nHer colour deepening by the exertion, he suggested that she should sit\ndown again on one of the mossy boulders by the wayside. Nothing loth she\ndid, De Stancy standing by, and with his cane scratching the moss from\nthe stone.\n\n'This is rather awkward,' said Paula, in her usual circumspect way. 'My\nrelatives and your sister will be sure to suspect me of having arranged\nthis scramble with you.'\n\n'But I know better,' sighed De Stancy. 'I wish to Heaven you had\narranged it!'\n\nShe was not at the top, but she took advantage of the halt to answer his\nprevious question. 'There are many points on which I must be satisfied\nbefore I can reaffirm anything. Do you not see that you are mistaken\nin clinging to this idea?--that you are laying up mortification and\ndisappointment for yourself?'\n\n'A negative reply from you would be disappointment, early or late.'\n\n'And you prefer having it late to accepting it now? If I were a man, I\nshould like to abandon a false scent as soon as possible.'\n\n'I suppose all that has but one meaning: that I am to go.'\n\n'O no,' she magnanimously assured him, bounding up from her seat; 'I\nadhere to my statement that you may stay; though it is true something\nmay possibly happen to make me alter my mind.'\n\nHe again offered his arm, and from sheer necessity she leant upon it as\nbefore.\n\n'Grant me but a moment's patience,' he began.\n\n'Captain De Stancy! Is this fair? I am physically obliged to hold your\narm, so that I MUST listen to what you say!'\n\n'No, it is not fair; 'pon my soul it is not!' said De Stancy. 'I won't\nsay another word.'\n\nHe did not; and they clambered on through the boughs, nothing disturbing\nthe solitude but the rustle of their own footsteps and the singing of\nbirds overhead. They occasionally got a peep at the sky; and whenever a\ntwig hung out in a position to strike Paula's face the gallant captain\nbent it aside with his stick. But she did not thank him. Perhaps he was\njust as well satisfied as if she had done so.\n\nPaula, panting, broke the silence: 'Will you go on, and discover if the\ntop is near?'\n\nHe went on. This time the top was near. When he returned she was sitting\nwhere he had left her among the leaves. 'It is quite near now,' he told\nher tenderly, and she took his arm again without a word. Soon the path\nchanged its nature from a steep and rugged watercourse to a level green\npromenade.\n\n'Thank you, Captain De Stancy,' she said, letting go his arm as if\nrelieved.\n\nBefore them rose the tower, and at the base they beheld two of their\nfriends, Mr. Power being seen above, looking over the parapet through\nhis glass.\n\n'You will go to the top now?' said De Stancy.\n\n'No, I take no interest in it. My interest has turned to fatigue. I only\nwant to go home.'\n\nHe took her on to where the carriage stood at the foot of the tower,\nand leaving her with his sister ascended the turret to the top. The\nlandscape had quite changed from its afternoon appearance, and had\nbecome rather marvellous than beautiful. The air was charged with a\nlurid exhalation that blurred the extensive view. He could see the\ndistant Rhine at its junction with the Neckar, shining like a thread\nof blood through the mist which was gradually wrapping up the declining\nsun. The scene had in it something that was more than melancholy,\nand not much less than tragic; but for De Stancy such evening effects\npossessed little meaning. He was engaged in an enterprise that taxed all\nhis resources, and had no sentiments to spare for air, earth, or skies.\n\n'Remarkable scene,' said Power, mildly, at his elbow.\n\n'Yes; I dare say it is,' said De Stancy. 'Time has been when I should\nhave held forth upon such a prospect, and wondered if its livid colours\nshadowed out my own life, et caetera, et caetera. But, begad, I have\nalmost forgotten there's such a thing as Nature, and I care for nothing\nbut a comfortable life, and a certain woman who does not care for me!...\nNow shall we go down?'\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\nIt was quite true that De Stancy at the present period of his existence\nwished only to escape from the hurly-burly of active life, and to win\nthe affection of Paula Power. There were, however, occasions when a\nrecollection of his old renunciatory vows would obtrude itself upon him,\nand tinge his present with wayward bitterness. So much was this the case\nthat a day or two after they had arrived at Mainz he could not refrain\nfrom making remarks almost prejudicial to his cause, saying to her, 'I\nam unfortunate in my situation. There are, unhappily, worldly reasons\nwhy I should pretend to love you, even if I do not: they are so strong\nthat, though really loving you, perhaps they enter into my thoughts of\nyou.'\n\n'I don't want to know what such reasons are,' said Paula, with\npromptness, for it required but little astuteness to discover that he\nalluded to the alienated Wessex home and estates. 'You lack tone,' she\ngently added: 'that's why the situation of affairs seems distasteful to\nyou.'\n\n'Yes, I suppose I am ill. And yet I am well enough.'\n\nThese remarks passed under a tree in the public gardens during an odd\nminute of waiting for Charlotte and Mrs. Goodman; and he said no more to\nher in private that day. Few as her words had been he liked them better\nthan any he had lately received. The conversation was not resumed till\nthey were gliding 'between the banks that bear the vine,' on board one\nof the Rhine steamboats, which, like the hotels in this early summer\ntime, were comparatively free from other English travellers; so that\neverywhere Paula and her party were received with open arms and cheerful\ncountenances, as among the first swallows of the season.\n\nThe saloon of the steamboat was quite empty, the few passengers being\noutside; and this paucity of voyagers afforded De Stancy a roomy\nopportunity.\n\nPaula saw him approach her, and there appearing in his face signs that\nhe would begin again on the eternal subject, she seemed to be struck\nwith a sense of the ludicrous.\n\nDe Stancy reddened. 'Something seems to amuse you,' he said.\n\n'It is over,' she replied, becoming serious.\n\n'Was it about me, and this unhappy fever in me?'\n\n'If I speak the truth I must say it was.'\n\n'You thought, \"Here's that absurd man again, going to begin his daily\nsupplication.\"'\n\n'Not \"absurd,\"' she said, with emphasis; 'because I don't think it is\nabsurd.'\n\nShe continued looking through the windows at the Lurlei Heights under\nwhich they were now passing, and he remained with his eyes on her.\n\n'May I stay here with you?' he said at last. 'I have not had a word with\nyou alone for four-and-twenty hours.'\n\n'You must be cheerful, then.'\n\n'You have said such as that before. I wish you would say \"loving\"\ninstead of \"cheerful.\"'\n\n'Yes, I know, I know,' she responded, with impatient perplexity. 'But\nwhy must you think of me--me only? Is there no other woman in the world\nwho has the power to make you happy? I am sure there must be.'\n\n'Perhaps there is; but I have never seen her.'\n\n'Then look for her; and believe me when I say that you will certainly\nfind her.'\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n'Captain De Stancy, I have long felt for you,' she continued, with a\nfrank glance into his face. 'You have deprived yourself too long of\nother women's company. Why not go away for a little time? and when\nyou have found somebody else likely to make you happy, you can meet me\nagain. I will see you at your father's house, and we will enjoy all the\npleasure of easy friendship.'\n\n'Very correct; and very cold, O best of women!'\n\n'You are too full of exclamations and transports, I think!'\n\nThey stood in silence, Paula apparently much interested in the\nmanoeuvring of a raft which was passing by. 'Dear Miss Power,' he\nresumed, 'before I go and join your uncle above, let me just ask, Do I\nstand any chance at all yet? Is it possible you can never be more pliant\nthan you have been?'\n\n'You put me out of all patience!'\n\n'But why did you raise my hopes? You should at least pity me after doing\nthat.'\n\n'Yes; it's that again! I unfortunately raised your hopes because I was\na fool--was not myself that moment. Now question me no more. As it is I\nthink you presume too much upon my becoming yours as the consequence of\nmy having dismissed another.'\n\n'Not on becoming mine, but on listening to me.'\n\n'Your argument would be reasonable enough had I led you to believe I\nwould listen to you--and ultimately accept you; but that I have not\ndone. I see now that a woman who gives a man an answer one shade less\nperemptory than a harsh negative may be carried beyond her intentions,\nand out of her own power before she knows it.'\n\n'Chide me if you will; I don't care!'\n\nShe looked steadfastly at him with a little mischief in her eyes. 'You\nDO care,' she said.\n\n'Then why don't you listen to me? I would not persevere for a moment\nlonger if it were against the wishes of your family. Your uncle says it\nwould give him pleasure to see you accept me.'\n\n'Does he say why?' she asked thoughtfully.\n\n'Yes; he takes, of course, a practical view of the matter; he thinks it\ncommends itself so to reason and common sense that the owner of Stancy\nCastle should become a member of the De Stancy family.'\n\n'Yes, that's the horrid plague of it,' she said, with a nonchalance\nwhich seemed to contradict her words. 'It is so dreadfully reasonable\nthat we should marry. I wish it wasn't!'\n\n'Well, you are younger than I, and perhaps that's a natural wish. But to\nme it seems a felicitous combination not often met with. I confess that\nyour interest in our family before you knew me lent a stability to my\nhopes that otherwise they would not have had.'\n\n'My interest in the De Stancys has not been a personal interest except\nin the case of your sister,' she returned. 'It has been an historical\ninterest only; and is not at all increased by your existence.'\n\n'And perhaps it is not diminished?'\n\n'No, I am not aware that it is diminished,' she murmured, as she\nobserved the gliding shore.\n\n'Well, you will allow me to say this, since I say it without reference\nto your personality or to mine--that the Power and De Stancy families\nare the complements to each other; and that, abstractedly, they call\nearnestly to one another: \"How neat and fit a thing for us to join\nhands!\"'\n\nPaula, who was not prudish when a direct appeal was made to her common\nsense, answered with ready candour: 'Yes, from the point of view of\ndomestic politics, that undoubtedly is the case. But I hope I am not so\ncalculating as to risk happiness in order to round off a social idea.'\n\n'I hope not; or that I am either. Still the social idea exists, and my\nincreased years make its excellence more obvious to me than to you.'\n\nThe ice once broken on this aspect of the question, the subject seemed\nfurther to engross her, and she spoke on as if daringly inclined to\nventure where she had never anticipated going, deriving pleasure from\nthe very strangeness of her temerity: 'You mean that in the fitness of\nthings I ought to become a De Stancy to strengthen my social position?'\n\n'And that I ought to strengthen mine by alliance with the heiress of a\nname so dear to engineering science as Power.'\n\n'Well, we are talking with unexpected frankness.'\n\n'But you are not seriously displeased with me for saying what, after\nall, one can't help feeling and thinking?'\n\n'No. Only be so good as to leave off going further for the present.\nIndeed, of the two, I would rather have the other sort of address. I\nmean,' she hastily added, 'that what you urge as the result of a real\naffection, however unsuitable, I have some remote satisfaction in\nlistening to--not the least from any reciprocal love on my side, but\nfrom a woman's gratification at being the object of anybody's devotion;\nfor that feeling towards her is always regarded as a merit in a woman's\neye, and taken as a kindness by her, even when it is at the expense of\nher convenience.'\n\nShe had said, voluntarily or involuntarily, better things than he\nexpected, and perhaps too much in her own opinion, for she hardly gave\nhim an opportunity of replying.\n\nThey passed St. Goar and Boppard, and when steering round the sharp\nbend of the river just beyond the latter place De Stancy met her again,\nexclaiming, 'You left me very suddenly.'\n\n'You must make allowances, please,' she said; 'I have always stood in\nneed of them.'\n\n'Then you shall always have them.'\n\n'I don't doubt it,' she said quickly; but Paula was not to be caught\nagain, and kept close to the side of her aunt while they glided past\nBrauback and Oberlahnstein. Approaching Coblenz her aunt said, 'Paula,\nlet me suggest that you be not so much alone with Captain De Stancy.'\n\n'And why?' said Paula quietly.\n\n'You'll have plenty of offers if you want them, without taking trouble,'\nsaid the direct Mrs. Goodman. 'Your existence is hardly known to the\nworld yet, and Captain De Stancy is too near middle-age for a girl like\nyou.' Paula did not reply to either of these remarks, being seemingly so\ninterested in Ehrenbreitstein's heights as not to hear them.\n\n\n\nIX.\n\nIt was midnight at Coblenz, and the travellers had retired to rest in\ntheir respective apartments, overlooking the river. Finding that there\nwas a moon shining, Paula leant out of her window. The tall rock of\nEhrenbreitstein on the opposite shore was flooded with light, and a\nbelated steamer was drawing up to the landing-stage, where it presently\ndeposited its passengers.\n\n'We should have come by the last boat, so as to have been touched into\nromance by the rays of this moon, like those happy people,' said a\nvoice.\n\nShe looked towards the spot whence the voice proceeded, which was a\nwindow quite near at hand. De Stancy was smoking outside it, and she\nbecame aware that the words were addressed to her.\n\n'You left me very abruptly,' he continued.\n\nPaula's instinct of caution impelled her to speak.\n\n'The windows are all open,' she murmured. 'Please be careful.'\n\n'There are no English in this hotel except ourselves. I thank you for\nwhat you said to-day.'\n\n'Please be careful,' she repeated.\n\n'My dear Miss P----'\n\n'Don't mention names, and don't continue the subject!'\n\n'Life and death perhaps depend upon my renewing it soon!'\n\nShe shut the window decisively, possibly wondering if De Stancy had\ndrunk a glass or two of Steinberg more than was good for him, and saw\nno more of moonlit Ehrenbreitstein that night, and heard no more of De\nStancy. But it was some time before he closed his window, and previous\nto doing so saw a dark form at an adjoining one on the other side.\n\nIt was Mr. Power, also taking the air. 'Well, what luck to-day?' said\nPower.\n\n'A decided advance,' said De Stancy.\n\nNone of the speakers knew that a little person in the room above heard\nall this out-of-window talk. Charlotte, though not looking out, had left\nher casement open; and what reached her ears set her wondering as to the\nresult.\n\nIt is not necessary to detail in full De Stancy's imperceptible advances\nwith Paula during that northward journey--so slowly performed that it\nseemed as if she must perceive there was a special reason for delaying\nher return to England. At Cologne one day he conveniently overtook her\nwhen she was ascending the hotel staircase. Seeing him, she went to the\nwindow of the entresol landing, which commanded a view of the Rhine,\nmeaning that he should pass by to his room.\n\n'I have been very uneasy,' began the captain, drawing up to her side;\n'and I am obliged to trouble you sooner than I meant to do.'\n\nPaula turned her eyes upon him with some curiosity as to what was coming\nof this respectful demeanour. 'Indeed!' she said.\n\nHe then informed her that he had been overhauling himself since they\nlast talked, and had some reason to blame himself for bluntness and\ngeneral want of euphemism; which, although he had meant nothing by it,\nmust have been very disagreeable to her. But he had always aimed at\nsincerity, particularly as he had to deal with a lady who despised\nhypocrisy and was above flattery. However, he feared he might have\ncarried his disregard for conventionality too far. But from that time\nhe would promise that she should find an alteration by which he hoped\nhe might return the friendship at least of a young lady he honoured more\nthan any other in the world.\n\nThis retrograde movement was evidently unexpected by the honoured young\nlady herself. After being so long accustomed to rebuke him for his\npersistence there was novelty in finding him do the work for her. The\nguess might even have been hazarded that there was also disappointment.\n\nStill looking across the river at the bridge of boats which stretched to\nthe opposite suburb of Deutz: 'You need not blame yourself,' she said,\nwith the mildest conceivable manner, 'I can make allowances. All I wish\nis that you should remain under no misapprehension.'\n\n'I comprehend,' he said thoughtfully. 'But since, by a perverse fate, I\nhave been thrown into your company, you could hardly expect me to feel\nand act otherwise.'\n\n'Perhaps not.'\n\n'Since I have so much reason to be dissatisfied with myself,' he added,\n'I cannot refrain from criticizing elsewhere to a slight extent, and\nthinking I have to do with an ungenerous person.'\n\n'Why ungenerous?'\n\n'In this way; that since you cannot love me, you see no reason at all\nfor trying to do so in the fact that I so deeply love you; hence I say\nthat you are rather to be distinguished by your wisdom than by your\nhumanity.'\n\n'It comes to this, that if your words are all seriously meant it is much\nto be regretted we ever met,' she murmured. 'Now will you go on to where\nyou were going, and leave me here?'\n\nWithout a remonstrance he went on, saying with dejected whimsicality as\nhe smiled back upon her, 'You show a wisdom which for so young a lady is\nperfectly surprising.'\n\nIt was resolved to prolong the journey by a circuit through Holland and\nBelgium; but nothing changed in the attitudes of Paula and Captain De\nStancy till one afternoon during their stay at the Hague, when they had\ngone for a drive down to Scheveningen by the long straight avenue of\nchestnuts and limes, under whose boughs tufts of wild parsley waved\ntheir flowers, except where the buitenplaatsen of retired merchants\nblazed forth with new paint of every hue. On mounting the dune which\nkept out the sea behind the village a brisk breeze greeted their faces,\nand a fine sand blew up into their eyes. De Stancy screened Paula with\nhis umbrella as they stood with their backs to the wind, looking down\non the red roofs of the village within the sea wall, and pulling at the\nlong grass which by some means found nourishment in the powdery soil of\nthe dune.\n\nWhen they had discussed the scene he continued, 'It always seems to me\nthat this place reflects the average mood of human life. I mean, if we\nstrike the balance between our best moods and our worst we shall find\nour average condition to stand at about the same pitch in emotional\ncolour as these sandy dunes and this grey scene do in landscape.'\n\nPaula contended that he ought not to measure everybody by himself.\n\n'I have no other standard,' said De Stancy; 'and if my own is wrong, it\nis you who have made it so. Have you thought any more of what I said at\nCologne?'\n\n'I don't quite remember what you did say at Cologne?'\n\n'My dearest life!' Paula's eyes rounding somewhat, he corrected the\nexclamation. 'My dear Miss Power, I will, without reserve, tell it to\nyou all over again.'\n\n'Pray spare yourself the effort,' she said drily. 'What has that one\nfatal step betrayed me into!... Do you seriously mean to say that I am\nthe cause of your life being coloured like this scene of grass and sand?\nIf so, I have committed a very great fault!'\n\n'It can be nullified by a word.'\n\n'Such a word!'\n\n'It is a very short one.'\n\n'There's a still shorter one more to the purpose. Frankly, I believe you\nsuspect me to have some latent and unowned inclination for you--that you\nthink speaking is the only point upon which I am backward.... There now,\nit is raining; what shall we do? I thought this wind meant rain.'\n\n'Do? Stand on here, as we are standing now.'\n\n'Your sister and my aunt are gone under the wall. I think we will walk\ntowards them.'\n\n'You had made me hope,' he continued (his thoughts apparently far away\nfrom the rain and the wind and the possibility of shelter), 'that you\nmight change your mind, and give to your original promise a liberal\nmeaning in renewing it. In brief I mean this, that you would allow it to\nmerge into an engagement. Don't think it presumptuous,' he went on, as\nhe held the umbrella over her; 'I am sure any man would speak as I do. A\ndistinct permission to be with you on probation--that was what you gave\nme at Carlsruhe: and flinging casuistry on one side, what does that\nmean?'\n\n'That I am artistically interested in your family history.' And she went\nout from the umbrella to the shelter of the hotel where she found her\naunt and friend.\n\nDe Stancy could not but feel that his persistence had made some\nimpression. It was hardly possible that a woman of independent nature\nwould have tolerated his dangling at her side so long, if his presence\nwere wholly distasteful to her. That evening when driving back to the\nHague by a devious route through the dense avenues of the Bosch he\nconversed with her again; also the next day when standing by the Vijver\nlooking at the swans; and in each case she seemed to have at least\ngot over her objection to being seen talking to him, apart from the\nremainder of the travelling party.\n\nScenes very similar to those at Scheveningen and on the Rhine were\nenacted at later stages of their desultory journey. Mr. Power had\nproposed to cross from Rotterdam; but a stiff north-westerly breeze\nprevailing Paula herself became reluctant to hasten back to Stancy\nCastle. Turning abruptly they made for Brussels.\n\nIt was here, while walking homeward from the Park one morning, that her\nuncle for the first time alluded to the situation of affairs between\nherself and her admirer. The captain had gone up the Rue Royale with his\nsister and Mrs. Goodman, either to show them the house in which the ball\ntook place on the eve of Quatre Bras or some other site of interest, and\nthe two Powers were thus left to themselves. To reach their hotel they\npassed into a little street sloping steeply down from the Rue Royale to\nthe Place Ste. Gudule, where, at the moment of nearing the cathedral, a\nwedding party emerged from the porch and crossed in front of uncle and\nniece.\n\n'I hope,' said the former, in his passionless way, 'we shall see a\nperformance of this sort between you and Captain De Stancy, not so very\nlong after our return to England.'\n\n'Why?' asked Paula, following the bride with her eyes.\n\n'It is diplomatically, as I may say, such a highly correct thing--such\nan expedient thing--such an obvious thing to all eyes.'\n\n'Not altogether to mine, uncle,' she returned.\n\n''Twould be a thousand pities to let slip such a neat offer of adjusting\ndifficulties as accident makes you in this. You could marry more tin,\nthat's true; but you don't want it, Paula. You want a name, and historic\nwhat-do-they-call-it. Now by coming to terms with the captain you'll be\nLady De Stancy in a few years: and a title which is useless to him, and\na fortune and castle which are in some degree useless to you, will make\na splendid whole useful to you both.'\n\n'I've thought it over--quite,' she answered. 'And I quite see what\nthe advantages are. But how if I don't care one atom for artistic\ncompleteness and a splendid whole; and do care very much to do what my\nfancy inclines me to do?'\n\n'Then I should say that, taking a comprehensive view of human nature\nof all colours, your fancy is about the silliest fancy existing on this\nearthly ball.'\n\nPaula laughed indifferently, and her uncle felt that, persistent as was\nhis nature, he was the wrong man to influence her by argument. Paula's\nblindness to the advantages of the match, if she were blind, was that of\na woman who wouldn't see, and the best argument was silence.\n\nThis was in some measure proved the next morning. When Paula made her\nappearance Mrs. Goodman said, holding up an envelope: 'Here's a letter\nfrom Mr. Somerset.'\n\n'Dear me,' said she blandly, though a quick little flush ascended her\ncheek. 'I had nearly forgotten him!'\n\nThe letter on being read contained a request as brief as it was\nunexpected. Having prepared all the drawings necessary for the\nrebuilding, Somerset begged leave to resign the superintendence of the\nwork into other hands.\n\n'His letter caps your remarks very aptly,' said Mrs. Goodman, with\nsecret triumph. 'You are nearly forgetting him, and he is quite\nforgetting you.'\n\n'Yes,' said Paula, affecting carelessness. 'Well, I must get somebody\nelse, I suppose.'\n\n\n\nX.\n\nThey next deviated to Amiens, intending to stay there only one night;\nbut their schemes were deranged by the sudden illness of Charlotte. She\nhad been looking unwell for a fortnight past, though, with her usual\nself-abnegation, she had made light of her ailment. Even now she\ndeclared she could go on; but this was said over-night, and in\nthe morning it was abundantly evident that to move her was highly\nunadvisable. Still she was not in serious danger, and having called in a\nphysician, who pronounced rest indispensable, they prepared to remain in\nthe old Picard capital two or three additional days. Mr. Power thought\nhe would take advantage of the halt to run up to Paris, leaving De\nStancy in charge of the ladies.\n\nIn more ways than in the illness of Charlotte this day was the harbinger\nof a crisis.\n\nIt was a summer evening without a cloud. Charlotte had fallen asleep\nin her bed, and Paula, who had been sitting by her, looked out into the\nPlace St. Denis, which the hotel commanded. The lawn of the square was\nall ablaze with red and yellow clumps of flowers, the acacia trees were\nbrightly green, the sun was soft and low. Tempted by the prospect Paula\nwent and put on her hat; and arousing her aunt, who was nodding in the\nnext room, to request her to keep an ear on Charlotte's bedroom, Paula\ndescended into the Rue de Noyon alone, and entered the green enclosure.\n\nWhile she walked round, two or three little children in charge of a\nnurse trundled a large variegated ball along the grass, and it rolled\nto Paula's feet. She smiled at them, and endeavoured to return it by a\nslight kick. The ball rose in the air, and passing over the back of\na seat which stood under one of the trees, alighted in the lap of a\ngentleman hitherto screened by its boughs. The back and shoulders proved\nto be those of De Stancy. He turned his head, jumped up, and was at her\nside in an instant, a nettled flush having meanwhile crossed Paula's\nface.\n\n'I thought you had gone to the Hotoie Promenade,' she said hastily. 'I\nam going to the cathedral;' (obviously uttered lest it should seem that\nshe had seen him from the hotel windows, and entered the square for his\ncompany).\n\n'Of course: there is nothing else to go to here--even for Roundheads.'\n\n'If you mean ME by that, you are very much mistaken,' said she testily.\n\n'The Roundheads were your ancestors, and they knocked down my ancestors'\ncastle, and broke the stained glass and statuary of the cathedral,'\nsaid De Stancy slily; 'and now you go not only to a cathedral, but to a\nservice of the unreformed Church in it.'\n\n'In a foreign country it is different from home,' said Paula\nin extenuation; 'and you of all men should not reproach me for\ntergiversation--when it has been brought about by--by my sympathies\nwith--'\n\n'With the troubles of the De Stancys.'\n\n'Well, you know what I mean,' she answered, with considerable anxiety\nnot to be misunderstood; 'my liking for the old castle, and what it\ncontains, and what it suggests. I declare I will not explain to you\nfurther--why should I? I am not answerable to you!'\n\nPaula's show of petulance was perhaps not wholly because she had\nappeared to seek him, but also from being reminded by his criticism that\nMr. Woodwell's prophecy on her weakly succumbing to surroundings was\nslowly working out its fulfilment.\n\nShe moved forward towards the gate at the further end of the square,\nbeyond which the cathedral lay at a very short distance. Paula did not\nturn her head, and De Stancy strolled slowly after her down the Rue du\nCollege. The day happened to be one of the church festivals, and people\nwere a second time flocking into the lofty monument of Catholicism at\nits meridian. Paula vanished into the porch with the rest; and, almost\ncatching the wicket as it flew back from her hand, he too entered\nthe high-shouldered edifice--an edifice doomed to labour under the\nmelancholy misfortune of seeming only half as vast as it really is, and\nas truly as whimsically described by Heine as a monument built with the\nstrength of Titans, and decorated with the patience of dwarfs.\n\nDe Stancy walked up the nave, so close beside her as to touch her dress;\nbut she would not recognize his presence; the darkness that evening had\nthrown over the interior, which was scarcely broken by the few candles\ndotted about, being a sufficient excuse if she required one.\n\n'Miss Power,' De Stancy said at last, 'I am coming to the service with\nyou.'\n\nShe received the intelligence without surprise, and he knew she had been\nconscious of him all the way.\n\nPaula went no further than the middle of the nave, where there was\nhardly a soul, and took a chair beside a solitary rushlight which looked\namid the vague gloom of the inaccessible architecture like a lighthouse\nat the foot of tall cliffs.\n\nHe put his hand on the next chair, saying, 'Do you object?'\n\n'Not at all,' she replied; and he sat down.\n\n'Suppose we go into the choir,' said De Stancy presently. 'Nobody sits\nout here in the shadows.'\n\n'This is sufficiently near, and we have a candle,' Paula murmured.\n\nBefore another minute had passed the candle flame began to drown in its\nown grease, slowly dwindled, and went out.\n\n'I suppose that means I am to go into the choir in spite of myself.\nHeaven is on your side,' said Paula. And rising they left their now\ntotally dark corner, and joined the noiseless shadowy figures who in\ntwos and threes kept passing up the nave.\n\nWithin the choir there was a blaze of light, partly from the altar, and\nmore particularly from the image of the saint whom they had assembled\nto honour, which stood, surrounded by candles and a thicket of flowering\nplants, some way in advance of the foot-pace. A secondary radiance from\nthe same source was reflected upward into their faces by the polished\nmarble pavement, except when interrupted by the shady forms of the\nofficiating priests.\n\nWhen it was over and the people were moving off, De Stancy and his\ncompanion went towards the saint, now besieged by numbers of women\nanxious to claim the respective flower-pots they had lent for the\ndecoration. As each struggled for her own, seized and marched off with\nit, Paula remarked--'This rather spoils the solemn effect of what has\ngone before.'\n\n'I perceive you are a harsh Puritan.'\n\n'No, Captain De Stancy! Why will you speak so? I am far too much\notherwise. I have grown to be so much of your way of thinking, that\nI accuse myself, and am accused by others, of being worldly, and\nhalf-and-half, and other dreadful things--though it isn't that at all.'\n\nThey were now walking down the nave, preceded by the sombre figures with\nthe pot flowers, who were just visible in the rays that reached them\nthrough the distant choir screen at their back; while above the grey\nnight sky and stars looked in upon them through the high clerestory\nwindows.\n\n'Do be a little MORE of my way of thinking!' rejoined De Stancy\npassionately.\n\n'Don't, don't speak,' she said rapidly. 'There are Milly and Champreau!'\n\nMilly was one of the maids, and Champreau the courier and valet who had\nbeen engaged by Abner Power. They had been sitting behind the other pair\nthroughout the service, and indeed knew rather more of the relations\nbetween Paula and De Stancy than Paula knew herself.\n\nHastening on the two latter went out, and walked together silently up\nthe short street. The Place St. Denis was now lit up, lights shone\nfrom the hotel windows, and the world without the cathedral had so far\nadvanced in nocturnal change that it seemed as if they had been gone\nfrom it for hours. Within the hotel they found the change even greater\nthan without. Mrs. Goodman met them half-way on the stairs.\n\n'Poor Charlotte is worse,' she said. 'Quite feverish, and almost\ndelirious.'\n\nPaula reproached herself with 'Why did I go away!'\n\nThe common interest of De Stancy and Paula in the sufferer at once\nreproduced an ease between them as nothing else could have done. The\nphysician was again called in, who prescribed certain draughts, and\nrecommended that some one should sit up with her that night. If Paula\nallowed demonstrations of love to escape her towards anybody it\nwas towards Charlotte, and her instinct was at once to watch by the\ninvalid's couch herself, at least for some hours, it being deemed\nunnecessary to call in a regular nurse unless she should sicken further.\n\n'But I will sit with her,' said De Stancy. 'Surely you had better go to\nbed?' Paula would not be persuaded; and thereupon De Stancy, saying he\nwas going into the town for a short time before retiring, left the room.\n\nThe last omnibus returned from the last train, and the inmates of the\nhotel retired to rest. Meanwhile a telegram had arrived for Captain De\nStancy; but as he had not yet returned it was put in his bedroom, with\ndirections to the night-porter to remind him of its arrival.\n\nPaula sat on with the sleeping Charlotte. Presently she retired into the\nadjacent sitting-room with a book, and flung herself on a couch, leaving\nthe door open between her and her charge, in case the latter should\nawake. While she sat a new breathing seemed to mingle with the regular\nsound of Charlotte's that reached her through the doorway: she turned\nquickly, and saw her uncle standing behind her.\n\n'O--I thought you were in Paris!' said Paula.\n\n'I have just come from there--I could not stay. Something has occurred\nto my mind about this affair.' His strangely marked visage, now more\nnoticeable from being worn with fatigue, had a spectral effect by the\nnight-light.\n\n'What affair?'\n\n'This marriage.... Paula, De Stancy is a good fellow enough, but you\nmust not accept him just yet.'\n\nPaula did not answer.\n\n'Do you hear? You must not accept him,' repeated her uncle, 'till I have\nbeen to England and examined into matters. I start in an hour's time--by\nthe ten-minutes-past-two train.'\n\n'This is something very new!'\n\n'Yes--'tis new,' he murmured, relapsing into his Dutch manner. 'You must\nnot accept him till something is made clear to me--something about a\nqueer relationship. I have come from Paris to say so.'\n\n'Uncle, I don't understand this. I am my own mistress in all matters,\nand though I don't mind telling you I have by no means resolved to\naccept him, the question of her marriage is especially a woman's own\naffair.'\n\nHer uncle stood irresolute for a moment, as if his convictions were\nmore than his proofs. 'I say no more at present,' he murmured. 'Can I do\nanything for you about a new architect?'\n\n'Appoint Havill.'\n\n'Very well. Good night.' And then he left her. In a short time she heard\nhim go down and out of the house to cross to England by the morning\nsteamboat.\n\nWith a little shrug, as if she resented his interference in so delicate\na point, she settled herself down anew to her book.\n\nOne, two, three hours passed, when Charlotte awoke, but soon slumbered\nsweetly again. Milly had stayed up for some time lest her mistress\nshould require anything; but the girl being sleepy Paula sent her to\nbed.\n\nIt was a lovely night of early summer, and drawing aside the window\ncurtains she looked out upon the flowers and trees of the Place, now\nquite visible, for it was nearly three o'clock, and the morning light\nwas growing strong. She turned her face upwards. Except in the case of\none bedroom all the windows on that side of the hotel were in darkness.\nThe room being rather close she left the casement ajar, and opening the\ndoor walked out upon the staircase landing. A number of caged canaries\nwere kept here, and she observed in the dim light of the landing\nlamp how snugly their heads were all tucked in. On returning to the\nsitting-room again she could hear that Charlotte was still slumbering,\nand this encouraging circumstance disposed her to go to bed herself.\nBefore, however, she had made a move a gentle tap came to the door.\n\nPaula opened it. There, in the faint light by the sleeping canaries,\nstood Charlotte's brother.\n\n'How is she now?' he whispered.\n\n'Sleeping soundly,' said Paula.\n\n'That's a blessing. I have not been to bed. I came in late, and have now\ncome down to know if I had not better take your place?'\n\n'Nobody is required, I think. But you can judge for yourself.'\n\nUp to this point they had conversed in the doorway of the sitting-room,\nwhich De Stancy now entered, crossing it to Charlotte's apartment. He\ncame out from the latter at a pensive pace.\n\n'She is doing well,' he said gently. 'You have been very good to her.\nWas the chair I saw by her bed the one you have been sitting in all\nnight?'\n\n'I sometimes sat there; sometimes here.'\n\n'I wish I could have sat beside you, and held your hand--I speak\nfrankly.'\n\n'To excess.'\n\n'And why not? I do not wish to hide from you any corner of my breast,\nfutile as candour may be. Just Heaven! for what reason is it ordered\nthat courtship, in which soldiers are usually so successful, should be a\nfailure with me?'\n\n'Your lack of foresight chiefly in indulging feelings that were not\nencouraged. That, and my uncle's indiscreet permission to you to travel\nwith us, have precipitated our relations in a way that I could neither\nforesee nor avoid, though of late I have had apprehensions that it might\ncome to this. You vex and disturb me by such words of regret.'\n\n'Not more than you vex and disturb me. But you cannot hate the man who\nloves you so devotedly?'\n\n'I have said before I don't hate you. I repeat that I am interested in\nyour family and its associations because of its complete contrast with\nmy own.' She might have added, 'And I am additionally interested just\nnow because my uncle has forbidden me to be.'\n\n'But you don't care enough for me personally to save my happiness.'\n\nPaula hesitated; from the moment De Stancy confronted her she had\nfelt that this nocturnal conversation was to be a grave business. The\ncathedral clock struck three. 'I have thought once or twice,' she said\nwith a naivete unusual in her, 'that if I could be sure of giving peace\nand joy to your mind by becoming your wife, I ought to endeavour to\ndo so and make the best of it--merely as a charity. But I believe that\nfeeling is a mistake: your discontent is constitutional, and would go on\njust the same whether I accepted you or no. My refusal of you is purely\nan imaginary grievance.'\n\n'Not if I think otherwise.'\n\n'O no,' she murmured, with a sense that the place was very lonely and\nsilent. 'If you think it otherwise, I suppose it is otherwise.'\n\n'My darling; my Paula!' he said, seizing her hand. 'Do promise me\nsomething. You must indeed!'\n\n'Captain De Stancy!' she said, trembling and turning away. 'Captain De\nStancy!' She tried to withdraw her fingers, then faced him, exclaiming\nin a firm voice a third time, 'Captain De Stancy! let go my hand; for I\ntell you I will not marry you!'\n\n'Good God!' he cried, dropping her hand. 'What have I driven you to say\nin your anger! Retract it--O, retract it!'\n\n'Don't urge me further, as you value my good opinion!'\n\n'To lose you now, is to lose you for ever. Come, please answer!'\n\n'I won't be compelled!' she interrupted with vehemence. 'I am resolved\nnot to be yours--not to give you an answer to-night! Never, never will I\nbe reasoned out of my intention; and I say I won't answer you to-night!\nI should never have let you be so much with me but for pity of you; and\nnow it is come to this!'\n\nShe had sunk into a chair, and now leaned upon her hand, and buried her\nface in her handkerchief. He had never caused her any such agitation as\nthis before.\n\n'You stab me with your words,' continued De Stancy. 'The experience\nI have had with you is without parallel, Paula. It seems like a\ndistracting dream.'\n\n'I won't be hurried by anybody!'\n\n'That may mean anything,' he said, with a perplexed, passionate air.\n'Well, mine is a fallen family, and we must abide caprices. Would to\nHeaven it were extinguished!'\n\n'What was extinguished?' she murmured.\n\n'The De Stancys. Here am I, a homeless wanderer, living on my pay;\nin the next room lies she, my sister, a poor little fragile feverish\ninvalid with no social position--and hardly a friend. We two represent\nthe De Stancy line; and I wish we were behind the iron door of our\nold vault at Sleeping-Green. It can be seen by looking at us and our\ncircumstances that we cry for the earth and oblivion!'\n\n'Captain De Stancy, it is not like that, I assure you,' sympathized\nPaula with damp eyelashes. 'I love Charlotte too dearly for you to talk\nlike that, indeed. I don't want to marry you exactly: and yet I cannot\nbring myself to say I permanently reject you, because I remember you\nare Charlotte's brother, and do not wish to be the cause of any morbid\nfeelings in you which would ruin your future prospects.'\n\n'My dear life, what is it you doubt in me? Your earnestness not to do me\nharm makes it all the harder for me to think of never being more than a\nfriend.'\n\n'Well, I have not positively refused!' she exclaimed, in mixed tones\nof pity and distress. 'Let me think it over a little while. It is not\ngenerous to urge so strongly before I can collect my thoughts, and at\nthis midnight time!'\n\n'Darling, forgive it!--There, I'll say no more.'\n\nHe then offered to sit up in her place for the remainder of the night;\nbut Paula declined, assuring him that she meant to stay only another\nhalf-hour, after which nobody would be necessary.\n\nHe had already crossed the landing to ascend to his room, when she\nstepped after him, and asked if he had received his telegram.\n\n'No,' said De Stancy. 'Nor have I heard of one.'\n\nPaula explained that it was put in his room, that he might see it the\nmoment he came in.\n\n'It matters very little,' he replied, 'since I shall see it now.\nGood-night, dearest: good-night!' he added tenderly.\n\nShe gravely shook her head. 'It is not for you to express yourself like\nthat,' she answered. 'Good-night, Captain De Stancy.'\n\nHe went up the stairs to the second floor, and Paula returned to the\nsitting-room. Having left a light burning De Stancy proceeded to look\nfor the telegram, and found it on the carpet, where it had been\nswept from the table. When he had opened the sheet a sudden solemnity\noverspread his face. He sat down, rested his elbow on the table, and his\nforehead on his hands.\n\nCaptain De Stancy did not remain thus long. Rising he went softly\ndownstairs. The grey morning had by this time crept into the hotel,\nrendering a light no longer necessary. The old clock on the landing was\nwithin a few minutes of four, and the birds were hopping up and down\ntheir cages, and whetting their bills. He tapped at the sitting-room,\nand she came instantly.\n\n'But I told you it was not necessary--' she began.\n\n'Yes, but the telegram,' he said hurriedly. 'I wanted to let you know\nfirst that--it is very serious. Paula--my father is dead! He died\nsuddenly yesterday, and I must go at once... . About Charlotte--and how\nto let her know--'\n\n'She must not be told yet,' said Paula.... 'Sir William dead!'\n\n'You think we had better not tell her just yet?' said De Stancy\nanxiously. 'That's what I want to consult you about, if you--don't mind\nmy intruding.'\n\n'Certainly I don't,' she said.\n\nThey continued the discussion for some time; and it was decided that\nCharlotte should not be informed of what had happened till the doctor\nhad been consulted, Paula promising to account for her brother's\ndeparture.\n\nDe Stancy then prepared to leave for England by the first morning train,\nand roused the night-porter, which functionary, having packed off Abner\nPower, was discovered asleep on the sofa of the landlord's parlour. At\nhalf-past five Paula, who in the interim had been pensively sitting with\nher hand to her chin, quite forgetting that she had meant to go to bed,\nheard wheels without, and looked from the window. A fly had been brought\nround, and one of the hotel servants was in the act of putting up a\nportmanteau with De Stancy's initials upon it. A minute afterwards the\ncaptain came to her door.\n\n'I thought you had not gone to bed, after all.'\n\n'I was anxious to see you off,' said she, 'since neither of the others\nis awake; and you wished me not to rouse them.'\n\n'Quite right, you are very good;' and lowering his voice: 'Paula, it is\na sad and solemn time with me. Will you grant me one word--not on our\nlast sad subject, but on the previous one--before I part with you to go\nand bury my father?'\n\n'Certainly,' she said, in gentle accents.\n\n'Then have you thought over my position? Will you at last have pity upon\nmy loneliness by becoming my wife?'\n\nPaula sighed deeply; and said, 'Yes.'\n\n'Your hand upon it.'\n\nShe gave him her hand: he held it a few moments, then raised it to his\nlips, and was gone.\n\nWhen Mrs. Goodman rose she was informed of Sir William's death, and of\nhis son's departure.\n\n'Then the captain is now Sir William De Stancy!' she exclaimed. 'Really,\nPaula, since you would be Lady De Stancy by marrying him, I almost\nthink--'\n\n'Hush, aunt!'\n\n'Well; what are you writing there?'\n\n'Only entering in my diary that I accepted him this morning for pity's\nsake, in spite of Uncle Abner. They'll say it was for the title, but\nknowing it was not I don't care.'\n\n\n\nXI.\n\nOn the evening of the fourth day after the parting between Paula and De\nStancy at Amiens, when it was quite dark in the Markton highway,\nexcept in so far as the shades were broken by the faint lights from the\nadjacent town, a young man knocked softly at the door of Myrtle Villa,\nand asked if Captain De Stancy had arrived from abroad. He was answered\nin the affirmative, and in a few moments the captain himself came from\nan adjoining room.\n\nSeeing that his visitor was Dare, from whom, as will be remembered, he\nhad parted at Carlsruhe in no very satisfied mood, De Stancy did not ask\nhim into the house, but putting on his hat went out with the youth into\nthe public road. Here they conversed as they walked up and down, Dare\nbeginning by alluding to the death of Sir William, the suddenness of\nwhich he feared would delay Captain De Stancy's overtures for the hand\nof Miss Power.\n\n'No,' said De Stancy moodily. 'On the contrary, it has precipitated\nmatters.'\n\n'She has accepted you, captain?'\n\n'We are engaged to be married.'\n\n'Well done. I congratulate you.' The speaker was about to proceed to\nfurther triumphant notes on the intelligence, when casting his eye upon\nthe upper windows of the neighbouring villa, he appeared to reflect on\nwhat was within them, and checking himself, 'When is the funeral to be?'\n\n'To-morrow,' De Stancy replied. 'It would be advisable for you not to\ncome near me during the day.'\n\n'I will not. I will be a mere spectator. The old vault of our ancestors\nwill be opened, I presume, captain?'\n\n'It is opened.'\n\n'I must see it--and ruminate on what we once were: it is a thing I like\ndoing. The ghosts of our dead--Ah, what was that?'\n\n'I heard nothing.'\n\n'I thought I heard a footstep behind us.'\n\nThey stood still; but the road appeared to be quite deserted, and likely\nto continue so for the remainder of that evening. They walked on again,\nspeaking in somewhat lower tones than before.\n\n'Will the late Sir William's death delay the wedding much?' asked the\nyounger man curiously.\n\nDe Stancy languidly answered that he did not see why it should do\nso. Some little time would of course intervene, but, since there\nwere several reasons for despatch, he should urge Miss Power and her\nrelatives to consent to a virtually private wedding which might take\nplace at a very early date; and he thought there would be a general\nconsent on that point.\n\n'There are indeed reasons for despatch. Your title, Sir William, is a\nnew safeguard over her heart, certainly; but there is many a slip, and\nyou must not lose her now.'\n\n'I don't mean to lose her!' said De Stancy. 'She is too good to be lost.\nAnd yet--since she gave her promise I have felt more than once that\nI would not engage in such a struggle again. It was not a thing of my\nbeginning, though I was easily enough inflamed to follow. But I will not\nlose her now.--For God's sake, keep that secret you have so foolishly\npricked on your breast. It fills me with remorse to think what she with\nher scrupulous notions will feel, should she ever know of you and your\nhistory, and your relation to me!'\n\nDare made no reply till after a silence, when he said, 'Of course mum's\nthe word till the wedding is over.'\n\n'And afterwards--promise that for her sake?'\n\n'And probably afterwards.'\n\nSir William De Stancy drew a dejected breath at the tone of the answer.\nThey conversed but a little while longer, the captain hinting to Dare\nthat it was time for them to part; not, however, before he had uttered\na hope that the young man would turn over a new leaf and engage in some\nregular pursuit. Promising to call upon him at his lodgings De Stancy\nwent indoors, and Dare briskly retraced his steps to Markton.\n\nWhen his footfall had died away, and the door of the house opposite had\nbeen closed, another man appeared upon the scene. He came gently out of\nthe hedge opposite Myrtle Villa, which he paused to regard for a moment.\nBut instead of going townward, he turned his back upon the distant\nsprinkle of lights, and did not check his walk till he reached the lodge\nof Stancy Castle.\n\nHere he pulled the wooden acorn beside the arch, and when the porter\nappeared his light revealed the pedestrian's countenance to be scathed,\nas by lightning.\n\n'I beg your pardon, Mr. Power,' said the porter with sudden deference\nas he opened the wicket. 'But we wasn't expecting anybody to-night, as\nthere is nobody at home, and the servants on board wages; and that's why\nI was so long a-coming.'\n\n'No matter, no matter,' said Abner Power. 'I have returned on sudden\nbusiness, and have not come to stay longer than to-night. Your mistress\nis not with me. I meant to sleep in Markton, but have changed my mind.'\n\nMr. Power had brought no luggage with him beyond a small hand-bag, and\nas soon as a room could be got ready he retired to bed.\n\nThe next morning he passed in idly walking about the grounds and\nobserving the progress which had been made in the works--now temporarily\nsuspended. But that inspection was less his object in remaining there\nthan meditation, was abundantly evident. When the bell began to toll\nfrom the neighbouring church to announce the burial of Sir William De\nStancy, he passed through the castle, and went on foot in the direction\nindicated by the sound. Reaching the margin of the churchyard he looked\nover the wall, his presence being masked by bushes and a group of\nidlers from Markton who stood in front. Soon a funeral procession of\nsimple--almost meagre and threadbare--character arrived, but Power did\nnot join the people who followed the deceased into the church. De Stancy\nwas the chief mourner and only relation present, the other followers of\nthe broken-down old man being an ancient lawyer, a couple of faithful\nservants, and a bowed villager who had been page to the late Sir\nWilliam's father--the single living person left in the parish who\nremembered the De Stancys as people of wealth and influence, and who\nfirmly believed that family would come into its rights ere long, and\noust the uncircumcized Philistines who had taken possession of the old\nlands.\n\nThe funeral was over, and the rusty carriages had gone, together with\nmany of the spectators; but Power lingered in the churchyard as if he\nwere looking for some one. At length he entered the church, passing by\nthe cavernous pitfall with descending steps which stood open outside the\nwall of the De Stancy aisle. Arrived within he scanned the few idlers\nof antiquarian tastes who had remained after the service to inspect the\nmonuments; and beside a recumbent effigy--the effigy in alabaster\nwhose features Paula had wiped with her handkerchief when there with\nSomerset--he beheld the man it had been his business to find. Abner\nPower went up and touched this person, who was Dare, on the shoulder.\n\n'Mr. Power--so it is!' said the youth. 'I have not seen you since we met\nin Carlsruhe.'\n\n'You shall see all the more of me now to make up for it. Shall we walk\nround the church?'\n\n'With all my heart,' said Dare.\n\nThey walked round; and Abner Power began in a sardonic recitative: 'I\nam a traveller, and it takes a good deal to astonish me. So I neither\nswooned nor screamed when I learnt a few hours ago what I had suspected\nfor a week, that you are of the house and lineage of Jacob.' He flung a\nnod towards the canopied tombs as he spoke.--'In other words, that you\nare of the same breed as the De Stancys.'\n\nDare cursorily glanced round. Nobody was near enough to hear their\nwords, the nearest persons being two workmen just outside, who were\nbringing their tools up from the vault preparatively to closing it.\n\nHaving observed this Dare replied, 'I, too, am a traveller; and neither\ndo I swoon nor scream at what you say. But I assure you that if you\nbusy yourself about me, you may truly be said to busy yourself about\nnothing.'\n\n'Well, that's a matter of opinion. Now, there's no scarlet left in my\nface to blush for men's follies; but as an alliance is afoot between my\nniece and the present Sir William, this must be looked into.'\n\nDare reflectively said 'O,' as he observed through the window one of\nthe workmen bring up a candle from the vault and extinguish it with his\nfingers.\n\n'The marriage is desirable, and your relationship in itself is of no\nconsequence,' continued the elder, 'but just look at this. You have\nforced on the marriage by unscrupulous means, your object being only too\nclearly to live out of the proceeds of that marriage.'\n\n'Mr. Power, you mock me, because I labour under the misfortune of having\nan illegitimate father to provide for. I really deserve commiseration.'\n\n'You might deserve it if that were all. But it looks bad for my\nniece's happiness as Lady De Stancy, that she and her husband are to be\nperpetually haunted by a young chevalier d'industrie, who can forge a\ntelegram on occasion, and libel an innocent man by an ingenious device\nin photography. It looks so bad, in short, that, advantageous as a title\nand old family name would be to her and her children, I won't let my\nbrother's daughter run the risk of having them at the expense of being\nin the grip of a man like you. There are other suitors in the world, and\nother titles: and she is a beautiful woman, who can well afford to be\nfastidious. I shall let her know at once of these things, and break off\nthe business--unless you do ONE THING.'\n\nA workman brought up another candle from the vault, and prepared to let\ndown the slab. 'Well, Mr. Power, and what is that one thing?'\n\n'Go to Peru as my agent in a business I have just undertaken there.'\n\n'And settle there?'\n\n'Of course. I am soon going over myself, and will bring you anything you\nrequire.'\n\n'How long will you give me to consider?' said Dare.\n\nPower looked at his watch. 'One, two, three, four hours,' he said. 'I\nleave Markton by the seven o'clock train this evening.'\n\n'And if I meet your proposal with a negative?'\n\n'I shall go at once to my niece and tell her the whole\ncircumstances--tell her that, by marrying Sir William, she allies\nherself with an unhappy gentleman in the power of a criminal son who\nmakes his life a burden to him by perpetual demands upon his purse; who\nwill increase those demands with his accession to wealth, threaten to\ndegrade her by exposing her husband's antecedents if she opposes his\nextortions, and who will make her miserable by letting her know that her\nold lover was shamefully victimized by a youth she is bound to screen\nout of respect to her husband's feelings. Now a man does not care to let\nhis own flesh and blood incur the danger of such anguish as that, and\nI shall do what I say to prevent it. Knowing what a lukewarm sentiment\nhers is for Sir William at best, I shall not have much difficulty.'\n\n'Well, I don't feel inclined to go to Peru.'\n\n'Neither do I want to break off the match, though I am ready to do it.\nBut you care about your personal freedom, and you might be made to wear\nthe broad arrow for your tricks on Somerset.'\n\n'Mr. Power, I see you are a hard man.'\n\n'I am a hard man. You will find me one. Well, will you go to Peru? Or\nI don't mind Australia or California as alternatives. As long as you\nchoose to remain in either of those wealth-producing places, so long\nwill Cunningham Haze go uninformed.'\n\n'Mr. Power, I am overcome. Will you allow me to sit down? Suppose we go\ninto the vestry. It is more comfortable.'\n\nThey entered the vestry, and seated themselves in two chairs, one at\neach end of the table.\n\n'In the meantime,' continued Dare, 'to lend a little romance to stern\nrealities, I'll tell you a singular dream I had just before you returned\nto England.' Power looked contemptuous, but Dare went on: 'I dreamt\nthat once upon a time there were two brothers, born of a Nonconformist\nfamily, one of whom became a railway-contractor, and the other a\nmechanical engineer.'\n\n'A mechanical engineer--good,' said Power, beginning to attend.\n\n'When the first went abroad in his profession, and became engaged on\ncontinental railways, the second, a younger man, looking round for a\nstart, also betook himself to the continent. But though ingenious and\nscientific, he had not the business capacity of the elder, whose\nrebukes led to a sharp quarrel between them; and they parted in bitter\nestrangement--never to meet again as it turned out, owing to the dogged\nobstinacy and self-will of the younger man. He, after this, seemed to\nlose his moral ballast altogether, and after some eccentric doings he\nwas reduced to a state of poverty, and took lodgings in a court in a\nback street of a town we will call Geneva, considerably in doubt as to\nwhat steps he should take to keep body and soul together.'\n\nAbner Power was shooting a narrow ray of eyesight at Dare from the\ncorner of his nearly closed lids. 'Your dream is so interesting,' he\nsaid, with a hard smile, 'that I could listen to it all day.'\n\n'Excellent!' said Dare, and went on: 'Now it so happened that the house\nopposite to the one taken by the mechanician was peculiar. It was a tall\nnarrow building, wholly unornamented, the walls covered with a layer of\nwhite plaster cracked and soiled by time. I seem to see that house now!\nSix stone steps led up to the door, with a rusty iron railing on each\nside, and under these steps were others which went down to a cellar--in\nmy dream of course.'\n\n'Of course--in your dream,' said Power, nodding comprehensively.\n\n'Sitting lonely and apathetic without a light, at his own chamber-window\nat night time, our mechanician frequently observed dark figures\ndescending these steps and ultimately discovered that the house was the\nmeeting-place of a fraternity of political philosophers, whose object\nwas the extermination of tyrants and despots, and the overthrow of\nestablished religions. The discovery was startling enough, but our hero\nwas not easily startled. He kept their secret and lived on as before. At\nlast the mechanician and his affairs became known to the society, as the\naffairs of the society had become known to the mechanician, and, instead\nof shooting him as one who knew too much for their safety, they were\nstruck with his faculty for silence, and thought they might be able to\nmake use of him.'\n\n'To be sure,' said Abner Power.\n\n'Next, like friend Bunyan, I saw in my dream that denunciation was\nthe breath of life to this society. At an earlier date in its history,\nobjectionable persons in power had been from time to time murdered, and\ncuriously enough numbered; that is, upon the body of each was set a mark\nor seal, announcing that he was one of a series. But at this time the\nquestion before the society related to the substitution for the dagger,\nwhich was vetoed as obsolete, of some explosive machine that would be\nboth more effectual and less difficult to manage; and in short, a large\nreward was offered to our needy Englishman if he would put their ideas\nof such a machine into shape.'\n\nAbner Power nodded again, his complexion being peculiar--which might\npartly have been accounted for by the reflection of window-light from\nthe green-baize table-cloth.\n\n'He agreed, though no politician whatever himself, to exercise his wits\non their account, and brought his machine to such a pitch of perfection,\nthat it was the identical one used in the memorable attempt--' (Dare\nwhispered the remainder of the sentence in tones so low that not a mouse\nin the corner could have heard.) 'Well, the inventor of that explosive\nhas naturally been wanted ever since by all the heads of police in\nEurope. But the most curious--or perhaps the most natural part of my\nstory is, that our hero, after the catastrophe, grew disgusted with\nhimself and his comrades, acquired, in a fit of revulsion, quite a\nconservative taste in politics, which was strengthened greatly by the\nnews he indirectly received of the great wealth and respectability of\nhis brother, who had had no communion with him for years, and supposed\nhim dead. He abjured his employers and resolved to abandon them;\nbut before coming to England he decided to destroy all trace of his\ncombustible inventions by dropping them into the neighbouring lake at\nnight from a boat. You feel the room close, Mr. Power?'\n\n'No, I suffer from attacks of perspiration whenever I sit in a\nconsecrated edifice--that's all. Pray go on.'\n\n'In carrying out this project, an explosion occurred, just as he was\nthrowing the stock overboard--it blew up into his face, wounding him\nseverely, and nearly depriving him of sight. The boat was upset, but\nhe swam ashore in the darkness, and remained hidden till he recovered,\nthough the scars produced by the burns had been set on him for ever.\nThis accident, which was such a misfortune to him as a man, was an\nadvantage to him as a conspirators' engineer retiring from practice,\nand afforded him a disguise both from his own brotherhood and from the\npolice, which he has considered impenetrable, but which is getting seen\nthrough by one or two keen eyes as time goes on. Instead of coming to\nEngland just then, he went to Peru, connected himself with the guano\ntrade, I believe, and after his brother's death revisited England, his\nold life obliterated as far as practicable by his new principles. He is\nknown only as a great traveller to his surviving relatives, though he\nseldom says where he has travelled. Unluckily for himself, he is WANTED\nby certain European governments as badly as ever.'\n\nDare raised his eyes as he concluded his narration. As has been\nremarked, he was sitting at one end of the vestry-table, Power at the\nother, the green cloth stretching between them. On the edge of the table\nadjoining Mr. Power a shining nozzle of metal was quietly resting, like\na dog's nose. It was directed point-blank at the young man.\n\nDare started. 'Ah--a revolver?' he said.\n\nMr. Power nodded placidly, his hand still grasping the pistol behind\nthe edge of the table. 'As a traveller I always carry one of 'em,' he\nreturned; 'and for the last five minutes I have been closely considering\nwhether your numerous brains are worth blowing out or no. The vault\nyonder has suggested itself as convenient and snug for one of the\nsame family; but the mental problem that stays my hand is, how am I to\ndespatch and bury you there without the workmen seeing?'\n\n''Tis a strange problem, certainly,' replied Dare, 'and one on which I\nfear I could not give disinterested advice. Moreover, while you, as a\ntraveller, always carry a weapon of defence, as a traveller so do I. And\nfor the last three-quarters of an hour I have been thinking concerning\nyou, an intensified form of what you have been thinking of me, but\nwithout any concern as to your interment. See here for a proof of it.'\nAnd a second steel nose rested on the edge of the table opposite to the\nfirst, steadied by Dare's right hand.\n\nThey remained for some time motionless, the tick of the tower clock\ndistinctly audible.\n\nMr. Power spoke first.\n\n'Well, 'twould be a pity to make a mess here under such dubious\ncircumstances. Mr. Dare, I perceive that a mean vagabond can be as sharp\nas a political regenerator. I cry quits, if you care to do the same?'\n\nDare assented, and the pistols were put away.\n\n'Then we do nothing at all, either side; but let the course of true love\nrun on to marriage--that's the understanding, I think?' said Dare as he\nrose.\n\n'It is,' said Power; and turning on his heel, he left the vestry.\n\nDare retired to the church and thence to the outside, where he idled\naway a few minutes in looking at the workmen, who were now lowering\ninto its place a large stone slab, bearing the words 'DE STANCY,' which\ncovered the entrance to the vault. When the footway of the churchyard\nwas restored to its normal condition Dare pursued his way to Markton.\n\nAbner Power walked back to the castle at a slow and equal pace, as\nthough he carried an over-brimming vessel on his head. He silently let\nhimself in, entered the long gallery, and sat down. The length of\ntime that he sat there was so remarkable as to raise that interval of\ninanition to the rank of a feat.\n\nPower's eyes glanced through one of the window-casements: from a hole\nwithout he saw the head of a tomtit protruding. He listlessly watched\nthe bird during the successive epochs of his thought, till night came,\nwithout any perceptible change occurring in him. Such fixity would have\nmeant nothing else than sudden death in any other man, but in Mr.\nPower it merely signified that he was engaged in ruminations which\nnecessitated a more extensive survey than usual. At last, at half-past\neight, after having sat for five hours with his eyes on the residence of\nthe tomtits, to whom night had brought cessation of thought, if not to\nhim who had observed them, he rose amid the shades of the furniture, and\nrang the bell. There were only a servant or two in the castle, one of\nwhom presently came with a light in her hand and a startled look upon\nher face, which was not reduced when she recognized him; for in the\nopinion of that household there was something ghoul-like in Mr. Power,\nwhich made him no desirable guest.\n\nHe ate a late meal, and retired to bed, where he seemed to sleep not\nunsoundly. The next morning he received a letter which afforded him\ninfinite satisfaction and gave his stagnant impulses a new momentum. He\nentered the library, and amid objects swathed in brown holland sat down\nand wrote a note to his niece at Amiens. Therein he stated that, finding\nthat the Anglo-South-American house with which he had recently connected\nhimself required his presence in Peru, it obliged him to leave without\nwaiting for her return. He felt the less uneasy at going, since he had\nlearnt that Captain De Stancy would return at once to Amiens to his sick\nsister, and see them safely home when she improved. He afterwards left\nthe castle, disappearing towards a railway station some miles above\nMarkton, the road to which lay across an unfrequented down.\n\n\n\nXII.\n\nIt was a fine afternoon of late summer, nearly three months subsequent\nto the death of Sir William De Stancy and Paula's engagement to\nmarry his successor in the title. George Somerset had started on a\nprofessional journey that took him through the charming district which\nlay around Stancy Castle. Having resigned his appointment as architect\nto that important structure--a resignation which had been accepted by\nPaula through her solicitor--he had bidden farewell to the locality\nafter putting matters in such order that his successor, whoever he might\nbe, should have no difficulty in obtaining the particulars necessary\nto the completion of the work in hand. Hardly to his surprise this\nsuccessor was Havill.\n\nSomerset's resignation had been tendered in no hasty mood. On returning\nto England, and in due course to the castle, everything bore in upon\nhis mind the exceeding sorrowfulness--he would not say humiliation--of\ncontinuing to act in his former capacity for a woman who, from seeming\nmore than a dear friend, had become less than an acquaintance.\n\nSo he resigned; but now, as the train drew on into that once beloved\ntract of country, the images which met his eye threw him back in point\nof emotion to very near where he had been before making himself a\nstranger here. The train entered the cutting on whose brink he had\nwalked when the carriage containing Paula and her friends surprised him\nthe previous summer. He looked out of the window: they were passing the\nwell-known curve that led up to the tunnel constructed by her father,\ninto which he had gone when the train came by and Paula had been alarmed\nfor his life. There was the path they had both climbed afterwards,\ninvoluntarily seizing each other's hand; the bushes, the grass, the\nflowers, everything just the same:\n\n            '-----Here was the pleasant place,\n          And nothing wanting was, save She, alas!'\n\nWhen they came out of the tunnel at the other end he caught a glimpse of\nthe distant castle-keep, and the well-remembered walls beneath it. The\nexperience so far transcended the intensity of what is called mournful\npleasure as to make him wonder how he could have miscalculated himself\nto the extent of supposing that he might pass the spot with controllable\nemotion.\n\nOn entering Markton station he withdrew into a remote corner of the\ncarriage, and closed his eyes with a resolve not to open them till the\nembittering scenes should be passed by. He had not long to wait for\nthis event. When again in motion his eye fell upon the skirt of a lady's\ndress opposite, the owner of which had entered and seated herself so\nsoftly as not to attract his attention.\n\n'Ah indeed!' he exclaimed as he looked up to her face. 'I had not a\nnotion that it was you!' He went over and shook hands with Charlotte De\nStancy.\n\n'I am not going far,' she said; 'only to the next station. We often run\ndown in summer time. Are you going far?'\n\n'I am going to a building further on; thence to Normandy by way of\nCherbourg, to finish out my holiday.'\n\nMiss De Stancy thought that would be very nice.\n\n'Well, I hope so. But I fear it won't.'\n\nAfter saying that Somerset asked himself why he should mince matters\nwith so genuine and sympathetic a girl as Charlotte De Stancy? She could\ntell him particulars which he burned to know. He might never again have\nan opportunity of knowing them, since she and he would probably not meet\nfor years to come, if at all.\n\n'Have the castle works progressed pretty rapidly under the new\narchitect?' he accordingly asked.\n\n'Yes,' said Charlotte in her haste--then adding that she was not quite\nsure if they had progressed so rapidly as before; blushingly correcting\nherself at this point and that, in the tinkering manner of a nervous\norganization aiming at nicety where it was not required.\n\n'Well, I should have liked to carry out the undertaking to its end,'\nsaid Somerset. 'But I felt I could not consistently do so. Miss Power--'\n(here a lump came into Somerset's throat--so responsive was he yet to\nher image)--'seemed to have lost confidence in me, and--it was best that\nthe connection should be severed.'\n\nThere was a long pause. 'She was very sorry about it,' said Charlotte\ngently.\n\n'What made her alter so?--I never can think!'\n\nCharlotte waited again as if to accumulate the necessary force for\nhonest speaking at the expense of pleasantness. 'It was the telegram\nthat began it of course,' she answered.\n\n'Telegram?'\n\nShe looked up at him in quite a frightened way--little as there was\nto be frightened at in a quiet fellow like him in this sad time of his\nlife--and said, 'Yes: some telegram--I think--when you were in trouble?\nForgive my alluding to it; but you asked me the question.'\n\nSomerset began reflecting on what messages he had sent Paula, troublous\nor otherwise. All he had sent had been sent from the castle, and were\nas gentle and mellifluous as sentences well could be which had neither\narticles nor pronouns. 'I don't understand,' he said. 'Will you explain\na little more--as plainly as you like--without minding my feelings?'\n\n'A telegram from Nice, I think?'\n\n'I never sent one.'\n\n'O! The one I meant was about money.'\n\nSomerset shook his head. 'No,' he murmured, with the composure of a man\nwho, knowing he had done nothing of the sort himself, was blinded by his\nown honesty to the possibility that another might have done it for him.\n'That must be some other affair with which I had nothing to do. O no,\nit was nothing like that; the reason for her change of manner was quite\ndifferent!'\n\nSo timid was Charlotte in Somerset's presence, that her timidity at this\njuncture amounted to blameworthiness. The distressing scene which\nmust have followed a clearing up there and then of any possible\nmisunderstanding, terrified her imagination; and quite confounded by\ncontradictions that she could not reconcile, she held her tongue, and\nnervously looked out of the window.\n\n'I have heard that Miss Power is soon to be married,' continued\nSomerset.\n\n'Yes,' Charlotte murmured. 'It is sooner than it ought to be by rights,\nconsidering how recently my dear father died; but there are reasons in\nconnection with my brother's position against putting it off: and it is\nto be absolutely simple and private.'\n\nThere was another interval. 'May I ask when it is to be?' he said.\n\n'Almost at once--this week.'\n\nSomerset started back as if some stone had hit his face.\n\nStill there was nothing wonderful in such promptitude: engagements\nbroken in upon by the death of a near relative of one of the parties had\nbeen often carried out in a subdued form with no longer delay.\n\nCharlotte's station was now at hand. She bade him farewell; and he\nrattled on to the building he had come to inspect, and next to Budmouth,\nwhence he intended to cross the Channel by steamboat that night.\n\nHe hardly knew how the evening passed away. He had taken up his quarters\nat an inn near the quay, and as the night drew on he stood gazing from\nthe coffee-room window at the steamer outside, which nearly thrust its\nspars through the bedroom casements, and at the goods that were being\ntumbled on board as only shippers can tumble them. All the goods were\nladen, a lamp was put on each side the gangway, the engines broke into\na crackling roar, and people began to enter. They were only waiting for\nthe last train: then they would be off. Still Somerset did not move;\nhe was thinking of that curious half-told story of Charlotte's, about\na telegram to Paula for money from Nice. Not once till within the last\nhalf-hour had it recurred to his mind that he had met Dare both at Nice\nand at Monte Carlo; that at the latter place he had been absolutely out\nof money and wished to borrow, showing considerable sinister feeling\nwhen Somerset declined to lend: that on one or two previous occasions he\nhad reasons for doubting Dare's probity; and that in spite of the young\nman's impoverishment at Monte Carlo he had, a few days later, beheld\nhim in shining raiment at Carlsruhe. Somerset, though misty in his\nconjectures, was seized with a growing conviction that there was\nsomething in Miss De Stancy's allusion to the telegram which ought to be\nexplained.\n\nHe felt an insurmountable objection to cross the water that night, or\ntill he had been able to see Charlotte again, and learn more of her\nmeaning. He countermanded the order to put his luggage on board, watched\nthe steamer out of the harbour, and went to bed. He might as well have\ngone to battle, for any rest that he got. On rising the next morning he\nfelt rather blank, though none the less convinced that a matter required\ninvestigation. He left Budmouth by a morning train, and about eleven\no'clock found himself in Markton.\n\nThe momentum of a practical inquiry took him through that ancient\nborough without leaving him much leisure for those reveries which had\nyesterday lent an unutterable sadness to every object there. It was just\nbefore noon that he started for the castle, intending to arrive at a\ntime of the morning when, as he knew from experience, he could speak to\nCharlotte without difficulty. The rising ground soon revealed the old\ntowers to him, and, jutting out behind them, the scaffoldings for the\nnew wing.\n\nWhile halting here on the knoll in some doubt about his movements he\nbeheld a man coming along the road, and was soon confronted by his\nformer competitor, Havill. The first instinct of each was to pass with a\nnod, but a second instinct for intercourse was sufficient to bring them\nto a halt. After a few superficial words had been spoken Somerset said,\n'You have succeeded me.'\n\n'I have,' said Havill; 'but little to my advantage. I have just heard\nthat my commission is to extend no further than roofing in the wing that\nyou began, and had I known that before, I would have seen the castle\nfall flat as Jericho before I would have accepted the superintendence.\nBut I know who I have to thank for that--De Stancy.'\n\nSomerset still looked towards the distant battlements. On the\nscaffolding, among the white-jacketed workmen, he could discern one\nfigure in a dark suit.\n\n'You have a clerk of the works, I see,' he observed.\n\n'Nominally I have, but practically I haven't.'\n\n'Then why do you keep him?'\n\n'I can't help myself. He is Mr. Dare; and having been recommended by a\nhigher power than I, there he must stay in spite of me.'\n\n'Who recommended him?'\n\n'The same--De Stancy.'\n\n'It is very odd,' murmured Somerset, 'but that young man is the object\nof my visit.'\n\n'You had better leave him alone,' said Havill drily.\n\nSomerset asked why.\n\n'Since I call no man master over that way I will inform you.' Havill\nthen related in splenetic tones, to which Somerset did not care to\nlisten till the story began to advance itself, how he had passed the\nnight with Dare at the inn, and the incidents of that night, relating\nhow he had seen some letters on the young man's breast which long had\npuzzled him. 'They were an E, a T, an N, and a C. I thought over them\nlong, till it eventually occurred to me that the word when filled out\nwas \"De Stancy,\" and that kinship explains the offensive and defensive\nalliance between them.'\n\n'But, good heavens, man!' said Somerset, more and more disturbed. 'Does\nshe know of it?'\n\n'You may depend she does not yet; but she will soon enough. Hark--there\nit is!' The notes of the castle clock were heard striking noon. 'Then it\nis all over.'\n\n'What?--not their marriage!'\n\n'Yes. Didn't you know it was the wedding day? They were to be at the\nchurch at half-past eleven. I should have waited to see her go, but it\nwas no sight to hinder business for, as she was only going to drive over\nin her brougham with Miss De Stancy.'\n\n'My errand has failed!' said Somerset, turning on his heel. 'I'll walk\nback to the town with you.'\n\nHowever he did not walk far with Havill; society was too much at that\nmoment. As soon as opportunity offered he branched from the road by\na path, and avoiding the town went by railway to Budmouth, whence he\nresumed, by the night steamer, his journey to Normandy.\n\n\n\nXIII.\n\nTo return to Charlotte De Stancy. When the train had borne Somerset from\nher side, and she had regained her self-possession, she became conscious\nof the true proportions of the fact he had asserted. And, further, if\nthe telegram had not been his, why should the photographic distortion\nbe trusted as a phase of his existence? But after a while it seemed so\nimprobable to her that God's sun should bear false witness, that instead\nof doubting both evidences she was inclined to readmit the first.\nStill, upon the whole, she could not question for long the honesty of\nSomerset's denial and if that message had indeed been sent by him, it\nmust have been done while he was in another such an unhappy state\nas that exemplified by the portrait. The supposition reconciled all\ndifferences; and yet she could not but fight against it with all the\nstrength of a generous affection.\n\nAll the afternoon her poor little head was busy on this perturbing\nquestion, till she inquired of herself whether after all it might not\nbe possible for photographs to represent people as they had never been.\nBefore rejecting the hypothesis she determined to have the word of a\nprofessor on the point, which would be better than all her surmises.\nReturning to Markton early, she told the coachman whom Paula had sent,\nto drive her to the shop of Mr. Ray, an obscure photographic artist in\nthat town, instead of straight home.\n\nRay's establishment consisted of two divisions, the respectable and the\nshabby. If, on entering the door, the visitor turned to the left,\nhe found himself in a magazine of old clothes, old furniture, china,\numbrellas, guns, fishing-rods, dirty fiddles, and split flutes. Entering\nthe right-hand room, which had originally been that of an independent\nhouse, he was in an ordinary photographer's and print-collector's\ndepository, to which a certain artistic solidity was imparted by a\nfew oil paintings in the background. Charlotte made for the latter\ndepartment, and when she was inside Mr. Ray appeared in person from the\nlumber-shop adjoining, which, despite its manginess, contributed by far\nthe greater share to his income.\n\nCharlotte put her question simply enough. The man did not answer her\ndirectly, but soon found that she meant no harm to him. He told her that\nsuch misrepresentations were quite possible, and that they embodied a\nform of humour which was getting more and more into vogue among certain\nfacetious persons of society.\n\nCharlotte was coming away when she asked, as on second thoughts, if he\nhad any specimens of such work to show her.\n\n'None of my own preparation,' said Mr. Ray, with unimpeachable probity\nof tone. 'I consider them libellous myself. Still, I have one or two\nsamples by me, which I keep merely as curiosities.--There's one,' he\nsaid, throwing out a portrait card from a drawer. 'That represents the\nGerman Emperor in a violent passion: this one shows the Prime Minister\nout of his mind; this the Pope of Rome the worse for liquor.'\n\nShe inquired if he had any local specimens.\n\n'Yes,' he said, 'but I prefer not to exhibit them unless you really ask\nfor a particular one that you mean to buy.'\n\n'I don't want any.'\n\n'O, I beg pardon, miss. Well, I shouldn't myself own such things were\nproduced, if there had not been a young man here at one time who was\nvery ingenious in these matters--a Mr. Dare. He was quite a gent, and\nonly did it as an amusement, and not for the sake of getting a living.'\n\nCharlotte had no wish to hear more. On her way home she burst into\ntears: the entanglement was altogether too much for her to tear asunder,\neven had not her own instincts been urging her two ways, as they were.\n\nTo immediately right Somerset's wrong was her impetuous desire as\nan honest woman who loved him; but such rectification would be the\njeopardizing of all else that gratified her--the marriage of her brother\nwith her dearest friend--now on the very point of accomplishment. It was\na marriage which seemed to promise happiness, or at least comfort, if\nthe old flutter that had transiently disturbed Paula's bosom could be\nkept from reviving, to which end it became imperative to hide from her\nthe discovery of injustice to Somerset. It involved the advantage of\nleaving Somerset free; and though her own tender interest in him had\nbeen too well schooled by habitual self-denial to run ahead on vain\npersonal hopes, there was nothing more than human in her feeling\npleasure in prolonging Somerset's singleness. Paula might even be\nallowed to discover his wrongs when her marriage had put him out of her\npower. But to let her discover his ill-treatment now might upset the\nimpending union of the families, and wring her own heart with the sight\nof Somerset married in her brother's place.\n\nWhy Dare, or any other person, should have set himself to advance her\nbrother's cause by such unscrupulous blackening of Somerset's character\nwas more than her sagacity could fathom. Her brother was, as far as she\ncould see, the only man who could directly profit by the machination,\nand was therefore the natural one to suspect of having set it going. But\nshe would not be so disloyal as to entertain the thought long; and who\nor what had instigated Dare, who was undoubtedly the proximate cause of\nthe mischief, remained to her an inscrutable mystery.\n\nThe contention of interests and desires with honour in her heart shook\nCharlotte all that night; but good principle prevailed. The wedding\nwas to be solemnized the very next morning, though for before-mentioned\nreasons this was hardly known outside the two houses interested; and\nthere were no visible preparations either at villa or castle. De Stancy\nand his groomsman--a brother officer--slept at the former residence.\n\nDe Stancy was a sorry specimen of a bridegroom when he met his sister\nin the morning. Thick-coming fancies, for which there was more than good\nreason, had disturbed him only too successfully, and he was as full of\napprehension as one who has a league with Mephistopheles. Charlotte told\nhim nothing of what made her likewise so wan and anxious, but drove\noff to the castle, as had been planned, about nine o'clock, leaving her\nbrother and his friend at the breakfast-table.\n\nThat clearing Somerset's reputation from the stain which had been thrown\non it would cause a sufficient reaction in Paula's mind to dislocate\npresent arrangements she did not so seriously anticipate, now that\nmorning had a little calmed her. Since the rupture with her former\narchitect Paula had sedulously kept her own counsel, but Charlotte\nassumed from the ease with which she seemed to do it that her feelings\ntowards him had never been inconveniently warm; and she hoped that Paula\nwould learn of Somerset's purity with merely the generous pleasure of a\nfriend, coupled with a friend's indignation against his traducer.\n\nStill, the possibility existed of stronger emotions, and it was only too\nevident to poor Charlotte that, knowing this, she had still less excuse\nfor delaying the intelligence till the strongest emotion would be\npurposeless.\n\nOn approaching the castle the first object that caught her eye was\nDare, standing beside Havill on the scaffolding of the new wing. He\nwas looking down upon the drive and court, as if in anticipation of the\nevent. His contiguity flurried her, and instead of going straight to\nPaula she sought out Mrs. Goodman.\n\n'You are come early; that's right!' said the latter. 'You might as well\nhave slept here last night. We have only Mr. Wardlaw, the London lawyer\nyou have heard of, in the house. Your brother's solicitor was here\nyesterday; but he returned to Markton for the night. We miss Mr. Power\nso much--it is so unfortunate that he should have been obliged to go\nabroad, and leave us unprotected women with so much responsibility.'\n\n'Yes, I know,' said Charlotte quickly, having a shy distaste for the\ndetails of what troubled her so much in the gross.\n\n'Paula has inquired for you.'\n\n'What is she doing?'\n\n'She is in her room: she has not begun to dress yet. Will you go to\nher?'\n\nCharlotte assented. 'I have to tell her something,' she said, 'which\nwill make no difference, but which I should like her to know this\nmorning--at once. I have discovered that we have been entirely mistaken\nabout Mr. Somerset.' She nerved herself to relate succinctly what had\ncome to her knowledge the day before.\n\nMrs. Goodman was much impressed. She had never clearly heard before what\ncircumstances had attended the resignation of Paula's architect. 'We had\nbetter not tell her till the wedding is over,' she presently said; 'it\nwould only disturb her, and do no good.'\n\n'But will it be right?' asked Miss De Stancy.\n\n'Yes, it will be right if we tell her afterwards. O yes--it must\nbe right,' she repeated in a tone which showed that her opinion was\nunstable enough to require a little fortification by the voice. 'She\nloves your brother; she must, since she is going to marry him; and it\ncan make little difference whether we rehabilitate the character of a\nfriend now, or some few hours hence. The author of those wicked tricks\non Mr. Somerset ought not to go a moment unpunished.'\n\n'That's what I think; and what right have we to hold our tongues even\nfor a few hours?'\n\nCharlotte found that by telling Mrs. Goodman she had simply made two\nirresolute people out of one, and as Paula was now inquiring for her,\nshe went upstairs without having come to any decision.\n\n\n\nXIV.\n\nPaula was in her boudoir, writing down some notes previous to beginning\nher wedding toilet, which was designed to harmonize with the simplicity\nthat characterized the other arrangements. She owned that it was\ndepriving the neighbourhood of a pageant which it had a right to expect\nof her; but the circumstance was inexorable.\n\nMrs. Goodman entered Paula's room immediately behind Charlotte. Perhaps\nthe only difference between the Paula of to-day and the Paula of last\nyear was an accession of thoughtfulness, natural to the circumstances in\nany case, and more particularly when, as now, the bride's isolation made\nself-dependence a necessity. She was sitting in a light dressing-gown,\nand her face, which was rather pale, flushed at the entrance of\nCharlotte and her aunt.\n\n'I knew you were come,' she said, when Charlotte stooped and kissed\nher. 'I heard you. I have done nothing this morning, and feel dreadfully\nunsettled. Is all well?'\n\nThe question was put without thought, but its aptness seemed almost to\nimply an intuitive knowledge of their previous conversation. 'Yes,' said\nCharlotte tardily.\n\n'Well, now, Clementine shall dress you, and I can do with Milly,'\ncontinued Paula. 'Come along. Well, aunt--what's the matter?--and you,\nCharlotte? You look harassed.'\n\n'I have not slept well,' said Charlotte.\n\n'And have not you slept well either, aunt? You said nothing about it at\nbreakfast.'\n\n'O, it is nothing,' said Mrs. Goodman quickly. 'I have been disturbed\nby learning of somebody's villainy. I am going to tell you all some time\nto-day, but it is not important enough to disturb you with now.'\n\n'No mystery!' argued Paula. 'Come! it is not fair.'\n\n'I don't think it is quite fair,' said Miss De Stancy, looking from one\nto the other in some distress. 'Mrs. Goodman--I must tell her! Paula,\nMr. Som--'\n\n'He's dead!' cried Paula, sinking into a chair and turning as pale as\nmarble. 'Is he dead?--tell me!' she whispered.\n\n'No, no--he's not dead--he is very well, and gone to Normandy for a\nholiday!'\n\n'O--I am glad to hear it,' answered Paula, with a sudden cool\nmannerliness.\n\n'He has been misrepresented,' said Mrs. Goodman. 'That's all.'\n\n'Well?' said Paula, with her eyes bent on the floor.\n\n'I have been feeling that I ought to tell you clearly, dear Paula,'\ndeclared her friend. 'It is absolutely false about his telegraphing to\nyou for money--it is absolutely false that his character is such as that\ndreadful picture represented it. There--that's the substance of it, and\nI can tell you particulars at any time.'\n\nBut Paula would not be told at any time. A dreadful sorrow sat in her\nface; she insisted upon learning everything about the matter there and\nthen, and there was no withstanding her.\n\nWhen it was all explained she said in a low tone: 'It is that\npernicious, evil man Dare--yet why is it he?--what can he have meant\nby it! Justice before generosity, even on one's wedding-day. Before I\nbecome any man's wife this morning I'll see that wretch in jail! The\naffair must be sifted.... O, it was a wicked thing to serve anybody\nso!--I'll send for Cunningham Haze this moment--the culprit is even now\non the premises, I believe--acting as clerk of the works!' The usually\nwell-balanced Paula was excited, and scarcely knowing what she did went\nto the bell-pull.\n\n'Don't act hastily, Paula,' said her aunt. 'Had you not better consult\nSir William? He will act for you in this.'\n\n'Yes--He is coming round in a few minutes,' said Charlotte, jumping at\nthis happy thought of Mrs. Goodman's. 'He's going to run across to see\nhow you are getting on. He will be here by ten.'\n\n'Yes--he promised last night.'\n\nShe had scarcely done speaking when the prancing of a horse was heard in\nthe ward below, and in a few minutes a servant announced Sir William De\nStancy.\n\nDe Stancy entered saying, 'I have ridden across for ten minutes, as I\nsaid I would do, to know if everything is easy and straightforward for\nyou. There will be time enough for me to get back and prepare if I start\nshortly. Well?'\n\n'I am ruffled,' said Paula, allowing him to take her hand.\n\n'What is it?' said her betrothed.\n\nAs Paula did not immediately answer Mrs. Goodman beckoned to Charlotte,\nand they left the room together.\n\n'A man has to be given in charge, or a boy, or a demon,' she replied. 'I\nwas going to do it, but you can do it better than I. He will run away if\nwe don't mind.'\n\n'But, my dear Paula, who is it?--what has he done?'\n\n'It is Dare--that young man you see out there against the sky.' She\nlooked from the window sideways towards the new wing, on the roof of\nwhich Dare was walking prominently about, after having assisted two of\nthe workmen in putting a red streamer on the tallest scaffold-pole. 'You\nmust send instantly for Mr. Cunningham Haze!'\n\n'My dearest Paula,' repeated De Stancy faintly, his complexion changing\nto that of a man who had died.\n\n'Please send for Mr. Haze at once,' returned Paula, with graceful\nfirmness. 'I said I would be just to a wronged man before I was generous\nto you--and I will. That lad Dare--to take a practical view of it--has\nattempted to defraud me of one hundred pounds sterling, and he shall\nsuffer. I won't tell you what he has done besides, for though it is\nworse, it is less tangible. When he is handcuffed and sent off to jail\nI'll proceed with my dressing. Will you ring the bell?'\n\n'Had you not better consider?' began De Stancy.\n\n'Consider!' said Paula, with indignation. 'I have considered. Will you\nkindly ring, Sir William, and get Thomas to ride at once to Mr. Haze? Or\nmust I rise from this chair and do it myself?'\n\n'You are very hasty and abrupt this morning, I think,' he faltered.\n\nPaula rose determinedly from the chair. 'Since you won't do it, I must,'\nshe said.\n\n'No, dearest!--Let me beg you not to!'\n\n'Sir William De Stancy!'\n\nShe moved towards the bell-pull; but he stepped before and intercepted\nher.\n\n'You must not ring the bell for that purpose,' he said with husky\ndeliberateness, looking into the depths of her face.\n\n'It wants two hours to the time when you might have a right to express\nsuch a command as that,' she said haughtily.\n\n'I certainly have not the honour to be your husband yet,' he sadly\nreplied, 'but surely you can listen? There exist reasons against giving\nthis boy in charge which I could easily get you to admit by explanation;\nbut I would rather, without explanation, have you take my word, when I\nsay that by doing so you are striking a blow against both yourself and\nme.'\n\nPaula, however, had rung the bell.\n\n'You are jealous of somebody or something perhaps!' she said, in tones\nwhich showed how fatally all this was telling against the intention of\nthat day. 'I will not be a party to baseness, if it is to save all my\nfortune!'\n\nThe bell was answered quickly. But De Stancy, though plainly in great\nmisery, did not give up his point. Meeting the servant at the door\nbefore he could enter the room he said. 'It is nothing; you can go\nagain.'\n\nPaula looked at the unhappy baronet in amazement; then turning to the\nservant, who stood with the door in his hand, said, 'Tell Thomas to\nsaddle the chestnut, and--'\n\n'It's all a mistake,' insisted De Stancy. 'Leave the room, James!'\n\nJames looked at his mistress.\n\n'Yes, James, leave the room,' she calmly said, sitting down. 'Now what\nhave you to say?' she asked, when they were again alone. 'Why must I not\nissue orders in my own house? Who is this young criminal, that you\nvalue his interests higher than my honour? I have delayed for one\nmoment sending my messenger to the chief constable to hear your\nexplanation--only for that.'\n\n'You will still persevere?'\n\n'Certainly. Who is he?'\n\n'Paula... he is my son.'\n\nShe remained still as death while one might count ten; then turned her\nback upon him. 'I think you had better go away,' she whispered. 'You\nneed not come again.'\n\nHe did not move. 'Paula--do you indeed mean this?' he asked.\n\n'I do.'\n\nDe Stancy walked a few paces, then said in a low voice: 'Miss Power,\nI knew--I guessed just now, as soon as it began--that we were going to\nsplit on this rock. Well--let it be--it cannot be helped; destiny is\nsupreme. The boy was to be my ruin; he is my ruin, and rightly. But\nbefore I go grant me one request. Do not prosecute him. Believe me, I\nwill do everything I can to get him out of your way. He shall annoy you\nno more.... Do you promise?'\n\n'I do,' she said. 'Now please leave me.'\n\n'Once more--am I to understand that no marriage is to take place to-day\nbetween you and me?'\n\n'You are.'\n\nSir William De Stancy left the room. It was noticeable throughout the\ninterview that his manner had not been the manner of a man altogether\ntaken by surprise. During the few preceding days his mood had been that\nof the gambler seasoned in ill-luck, who adopts pessimist surmises as a\nsafe background to his most sanguine hopes.\n\nShe remained alone for some time. Then she rang, and requested that\nMr. Wardlaw, her father's solicitor and friend, would come up to her. A\nmessenger was despatched, not to Mr. Cunningham Haze, but to the parson\nof the parish, who in his turn sent to the clerk and clerk's wife,\nthen busy in the church. On receipt of the intelligence the two latter\nfunctionaries proceeded to roll up the carpet which had been laid from\nthe door to the gate, put away the kneeling-cushions, locked the doors,\nand went off to inquire the reason of so strange a countermand. It was\nsoon proclaimed in Markton that the marriage had been postponed for a\nfortnight in consequence of the bride's sudden indisposition: and less\npublic emotion was felt than the case might have drawn forth, from the\nignorance of the majority of the populace that a wedding had been going\nto take place at all.\n\nMeanwhile Miss De Stancy had been closeted with Paula for more than an\nhour. It was a difficult meeting, and a severe test to any friendship\nbut that of the most sterling sort. In the turmoil of her distraction\nCharlotte had the consolation of knowing that if her act of justice to\nSomerset at such a moment were the act of a simpleton, it was the only\ncourse open to honesty. But Paula's cheerful serenity in some\nmeasure laid her own troubles to rest, till they were reawakened by a\nrumour--which got wind some weeks later, and quite drowned all other\nsurprises--of the true relation between the vanished clerk of works, Mr.\nDare, and the fallen family of De Stancy.\n\n\n\n\nBOOK THE SIXTH. PAULA.\n\n\nI.\n\n'I have decided that I cannot see Sir William again: I shall go away,'\nsaid Paula on the evening of the next day, as she lay on her bed in a\nflushed and highly-strung condition, though a person who had heard her\nwords without seeing her face would have assumed perfect equanimity to\nbe the mood which expressed itself with such quietness. This was the\ncase with her aunt, who was looking out of the window at some idlers\nfrom Markton walking round the castle with their eyes bent upon its\nwindows, and she made no haste to reply.\n\n'Those people have come to see me, as they have a right to do when\na person acts so strangely,' Paula continued. 'And hence I am better\naway.'\n\n'Where do you think to go to?'\n\nPaula replied in the tone of one who was actuated entirely by practical\nconsiderations: 'Out of England certainly. And as Normandy lies nearest,\nI think I shall go there. It is a very nice country to ramble in.'\n\n'Yes, it is a very nice country to ramble in,' echoed her aunt, in\nmoderate tones. 'When do you intend to start?'\n\n'I should like to cross to-night. You must go with me, aunt; will you\nnot?'\n\nMrs. Goodman expostulated against such suddenness. 'It will redouble\nthe rumours that are afloat, if, after being supposed ill, you are seen\ngoing off by railway perfectly well.'\n\n'That's a contingency which I am quite willing to run the risk of. Well,\nit would be rather sudden, as you say, to go to-night. But we'll go\nto-morrow night at latest.' Under the influence of the decision she\nbounded up like an elastic ball and went to the glass, which showed\na light in her eye that had not been there before this resolution to\ntravel in Normandy had been taken.\n\nThe evening and the next morning were passed in writing a final\nand kindly note of dismissal to Sir William De Stancy, in making\narrangements for the journey, and in commissioning Havill to take\nadvantage of their absence by emptying certain rooms of their furniture,\nand repairing their dilapidations--a work which, with that in hand,\nwould complete the section for which he had been engaged. Mr. Wardlaw\nhad left the castle; so also had Charlotte, by her own wish, her\nresidence there having been found too oppressive to herself to be\ncontinued for the present. Accompanied by Mrs. Goodman, Milly, and\nClementine, the elderly French maid, who still remained with them, Paula\ndrove into Markton in the twilight and took the train to Budmouth.\n\nWhen they got there they found that an unpleasant breeze was blowing out\nat sea, though inland it had been calm enough. Mrs. Goodman proposed to\nstay at Budmouth till the next day, in hope that there might be smooth\nwater; but an English seaport inn being a thing that Paula disliked\nmore than a rough passage, she would not listen to this counsel. Other\nimpatient reasons, too, might have weighed with her. When night came\ntheir looming miseries began. Paula found that in addition to her own\ntroubles she had those of three other people to support; but she did not\naudibly complain.\n\n'Paula, Paula,' said Mrs. Goodman from beneath her load of wretchedness,\n'why did we think of undergoing this?'\n\nA slight gleam of humour crossed Paula's not particularly blooming face,\nas she answered, 'Ah, why indeed?'\n\n'What is the real reason, my dear? For God's sake tell me!'\n\n'It begins with S.'\n\n'Well, I would do anything for that young man short of personal\nmartyrdom; but really when it comes to that--'\n\n'Don't criticize me, auntie, and I won't criticize you.'\n\n'Well, I am open to criticism just now, I am sure,' said her aunt, with\na green smile; and speech was again discontinued.\n\nThe morning was bright and beautiful, and it could again be seen in\nPaula's looks that she was glad she had come, though, in taking\ntheir rest at Cherbourg, fate consigned them to an hotel breathing an\natmosphere that seemed specially compounded for depressing the spirits\nof a young woman; indeed nothing had particularly encouraged her thus\nfar in her somewhat peculiar scheme of searching out and expressing\nsorrow to a gentleman for having believed those who traduced him; and\nthis coup d'audace to which she had committed herself began to look\nsomewhat formidable. When in England the plan of following him to\nNormandy had suggested itself as the quickest, sweetest, and most honest\nway of making amends; but having arrived there she seemed further off\nfrom his sphere of existence than when she had been at Stancy Castle.\nVirtually she was, for if he thought of her at all, he probably thought\nof her there; if he sought her he would seek her there. However, as he\nwould probably never do the latter, it was necessary to go on. It had\nbeen her sudden dream before starting, to light accidentally upon him in\nsome romantic old town of this romantic old province, but she had become\naware that the recorded fortune of lovers in that respect was not to be\ntrusted too implicitly.\n\nSomerset's search for her in the south was now inversely imitated.\nBy diligent inquiry in Cherbourg during the gloom of evening, in the\ndisguise of a hooded cloak, she learnt out the place of his stay while\nthere, and that he had gone thence to Lisieux. What she knew of the\narchitectural character of Lisieux half guaranteed the truth of the\ninformation. Without telling her aunt of this discovery she announced\nto that lady that it was her great wish to go on and see the beauties of\nLisieux.\n\nBut though her aunt was simple, there were bounds to her simplicity.\n'Paula,' she said, with an undeceivable air, 'I don't think you should\nrun after a young man like this. Suppose he shouldn't care for you by\nthis time.'\n\nIt was no occasion for further affectation. 'I am SURE he will,'\nanswered her niece flatly. 'I have not the least fear about it--nor\nwould you, if you knew how he is. He will forgive me anything.'\n\n'Well, pray don't show yourself forward. Some people are apt to fly into\nextremes.'\n\nPaula blushed a trifle, and reflected, and made no answer. However, her\npurpose seemed not to be permanently affected, for the next morning\nshe was up betimes and preparing to depart; and they proceeded almost\nwithout stopping to the architectural curiosity-town which had so\nquickly interested her. Nevertheless her ardent manner of yesterday\nunderwent a considerable change, as if she had a fear that, as her aunt\nsuggested, in her endeavour to make amends for cruel injustice, she was\nallowing herself to be carried too far.\n\nOn nearing the place she said, 'Aunt, I think you had better call upon\nhim; and you need not tell him we have come on purpose. Let him think,\nif he will, that we heard he was here, and would not leave without\nseeing him. You can also tell him that I am anxious to clear up a\nmisunderstanding, and ask him to call at our hotel.'\n\nBut as she looked over the dreary suburban erections which lined the\nroad from the railway to the old quarter of the town, it occurred to her\nthat Somerset would at that time of day be engaged in one or other of\nthe mediaeval buildings thereabout, and that it would be a much neater\nthing to meet him as if by chance in one of these edifices than to call\nupon him anywhere. Instead of putting up at any hotel, they left the\nmaids and baggage at the station; and hiring a carriage, Paula told the\ncoachman to drive them to such likely places as she could think of.\n\n'He'll never forgive you,' said her aunt, as they rumbled into the town.\n\n'Won't he?' said Paula, with soft faith. 'I'll see about that.'\n\n'What are you going to do when you find him? Tell him point-blank that\nyou are in love with him?'\n\n'Act in such a manner that he may tell me he is in love with me.'\n\nThey first visited a large church at the upper end of a square that\nsloped its gravelled surface to the western shine, and was pricked out\nwith little avenues of young pollard limes. The church within was one to\nmake any Gothic architect take lodgings in its vicinity for a fortnight,\nthough it was just now crowded with a forest of scaffolding for repairs\nin progress. Mrs. Goodman sat down outside, and Paula, entering, took a\nwalk in the form of a horse-shoe; that is, up the south aisle, round the\napse, and down the north side; but no figure of a melancholy young\nman sketching met her eye anywhere. The sun that blazed in at the west\ndoorway smote her face as she emerged from beneath it and revealed real\nsadness there.\n\n'This is not all the old architecture of the town by far,' she said to\nher aunt with an air of confidence. 'Coachman, drive to St. Jacques'.'\n\nHe was not at St. Jacques'. Looking from the west end of that building\nthe girl observed the end of a steep narrow street of antique character,\nwhich seemed a likely haunt. Beckoning to her aunt to follow in the fly\nPaula walked down the street.\n\nShe was transported to the Middle Ages. It contained the shops of\ntinkers, braziers, bellows-menders, hollow-turners, and other quaintest\ntrades, their fronts open to the street beneath stories of timber\noverhanging so far on each side that a slit of sky was left at the top\nfor the light to descend, and no more. A blue misty obscurity pervaded\nthe atmosphere, into which the sun thrust oblique staves of light. It\nwas a street for a mediaevalist to revel in, toss up his hat and shout\nhurrah in, send for his luggage, come and live in, die and be buried in.\nShe had never supposed such a street to exist outside the imaginations\nof antiquarians. Smells direct from the sixteenth century hung in the\nair in all their original integrity and without a modern taint. The\nfaces of the people in the doorways seemed those of individuals who\nhabitually gazed on the great Francis, and spoke of Henry the Eighth as\nthe king across the sea.\n\nShe inquired of a coppersmith if an English artist had been seen here\nlately. With a suddenness that almost discomfited her he announced\nthat such a man had been seen, sketching a house just below--the 'Vieux\nManoir de Francois premier.' Just turning to see that her aunt was\nfollowing in the fly, Paula advanced to the house. The wood framework of\nthe lower story was black and varnished; the upper story was brown and\nnot varnished; carved figures of dragons, griffins, satyrs, and mermaids\nswarmed over the front; an ape stealing apples was the subject of this\ncantilever, a man undressing of that. These figures were cloaked with\nlittle cobwebs which waved in the breeze, so that each figure seemed\nalive.\n\nShe examined the woodwork closely; here and there she discerned\npencil-marks which had no doubt been jotted thereon by Somerset as\npoints of admeasurement, in the way she had seen him mark them at the\ncastle. Some fragments of paper lay below: there were pencilled lines on\nthem, and they bore a strong resemblance to a spoilt leaf of Somerset's\nsketch-book. Paula glanced up, and from a window above protruded an old\nwoman's head, which, with the exception of the white handkerchief tied\nround it, was so nearly of the colour of the carvings that she might\neasily have passed as of a piece with them. The aged woman continued\nmotionless, the remains of her eyes being bent upon Paula, who asked her\nin Englishwoman's French where the sketcher had gone. Without replying,\nthe crone produced a hand and extended finger from her side, and pointed\ntowards the lower end of the street.\n\nPaula went on, the carriage following with difficulty, on account of\nthe obstructions in the thoroughfare. At bottom, the street abutted on\na wide one with customary modern life flowing through it; and as she\nlooked, Somerset crossed her front along this street, hurrying as if for\na wager.\n\nBy the time that Paula had reached the bottom Somerset was a long way\nto the left, and she recognized to her dismay that the busy transverse\nstreet was one which led to the railway. She quickened her pace to a\nrun; he did not see her; he even walked faster. She looked behind for\nthe carriage. The driver in emerging from the sixteenth-century street\nto the nineteenth had apparently turned to the right, instead of to the\nleft as she had done, so that her aunt had lost sight of her. However,\nshe dare not mind it, if Somerset would but look back! He partly turned,\nbut not far enough, and it was only to hail a passing omnibus upon which\nshe discerned his luggage. Somerset jumped in, the omnibus drove on, and\ndiminished up the long road. Paula stood hopelessly still, and in a few\nminutes puffs of steam showed her that the train had gone.\n\nShe turned and waited, the two or three children who had gathered\nround her looking up sympathizingly in her face. Her aunt, having now\ndiscovered the direction of her flight, drove up and beckoned to her.\n\n'What's the matter?' asked Mrs. Goodman in alarm.\n\n'Why?'\n\n'That you should run like that, and look so woebegone.'\n\n'Nothing: only I have decided not to stay in this town.'\n\n'What! he is gone, I suppose?'\n\n'Yes!' exclaimed Paula, with tears of vexation in her eyes. 'It isn't\nevery man who gets a woman of my position to run after him on foot, and\nalone, and he ought to have looked round! Drive to the station; I want\nto make an inquiry.'\n\nOn reaching the station she asked the booking-clerk some questions, and\nreturned to her aunt with a cheerful countenance. 'Mr. Somerset has only\ngone to Caen,' she said. 'He is the only Englishman who went by this\ntrain, so there is no mistake. There is no other train for two hours. We\nwill go on then--shall we?'\n\n'I am indifferent,' said Mrs. Goodman. 'But, Paula, do you think this\nquite right? Perhaps he is not so anxious for your forgiveness as you\nthink. Perhaps he saw you, and wouldn't stay.'\n\nA momentary dismay crossed her face, but it passed, and she answered,\n'Aunt, that's nonsense. I know him well enough, and can assure you that\nif he had only known I was running after him, he would have looked round\nsharply enough, and would have given his little finger rather than have\nmissed me! I don't make myself so silly as to run after a gentleman\nwithout good grounds, for I know well that it is an undignified thing to\ndo. Indeed, I could never have thought of doing it, if I had not been so\nmiserably in the wrong!'\n\n\n\nII.\n\nThat evening when the sun was dropping out of sight they started for the\ncity of Somerset's pilgrimage. Paula seated herself with her face toward\nthe western sky, watching from her window the broad red horizon, across\nwhich moved thin poplars lopped to human shapes, like the walking forms\nin Nebuchadnezzar's furnace. It was dark when the travellers drove into\nCaen.\n\nShe still persisted in her wish to casually encounter Somerset in some\naisle, lady-chapel, or crypt to which he might have betaken himself to\ncopy and learn the secret of the great artists who had erected those\nnooks. Mrs. Goodman was for discovering his inn, and calling upon him in\na straightforward way; but Paula seemed afraid of it, and they went out\nin the morning on foot. First they searched the church of St. Sauveur;\nhe was not there; next the church of St. Jean; then the church of St.\nPierre; but he did not reveal himself, nor had any verger seen or heard\nof such a man. Outside the latter church was a public flower-garden, and\nshe sat down to consider beside a round pool in which water-lilies grew\nand gold-fish swam, near beds of fiery geraniums, dahlias, and verbenas\njust past their bloom. Her enterprise had not been justified by its\nresults so far; but meditation still urged her to listen to the little\nvoice within and push on. She accordingly rejoined her aunt, and they\ndrove up the hill to the Abbaye aux Dames, the day by this time having\ngrown hot and oppressive.\n\nThe church seemed absolutely empty, the void being emphasized by its\ngrateful coolness. But on going towards the east end they perceived a\nbald gentleman close to the screen, looking to the right and to the\nleft as if much perplexed. Paula merely glanced over him, his back being\ntoward her, and turning to her aunt said softly, 'I wonder how we get\ninto the choir?'\n\n'That's just what I am wondering,' said the old gentleman, abruptly\nfacing round, and Paula discovered that the countenance was not\nunfamiliar to her eye. Since knowing Somerset she had added to her\ngallery of celebrities a photograph of his father, the Academician, and\nhe it was now who confronted her.\n\nFor the moment embarrassment, due to complicated feelings, brought a\nslight blush to her cheek, but being well aware that he did not know\nher, she answered, coolly enough, 'I suppose we must ask some one.'\n\n'And we certainly would if there were any one to ask,' he said, still\nlooking eastward, and not much at her. 'I have been here a long time,\nbut nobody comes. Not that I want to get in on my own account; for\nthough it is thirty years since I last set foot in this place, I\nremember it as if it were but yesterday.'\n\n'Indeed. I have never been here before,' said Paula.\n\n'Naturally. But I am looking for a young man who is making sketches in\nsome of these buildings, and it is as likely as not that he is in the\ncrypt under this choir, for it is just such out-of-the-way nooks that\nhe prefers. It is very provoking that he should not have told me more\ndistinctly in his letter where to find him.'\n\nMrs. Goodman, who had gone to make inquiries, now came back, and\ninformed them that she had learnt that it was necessary to pass through\nthe Hotel-Dieu to the choir, to do which they must go outside. Thereupon\nthey walked on together, and Mr. Somerset, quite ignoring his troubles,\nmade remarks upon the beauty of the architecture; and in absence of\nmind, by reason either of the subject, or of his listener, retained his\nhat in his hand after emerging from the church, while they walked all\nthe way across the Place and into the Hospital gardens.\n\n'A very civil man,' said Mrs. Goodman to Paula privately.\n\n'Yes,' said Paula, who had not told her aunt that she recognized him.\n\nOne of the Sisters now preceded them towards the choir and crypt, Mr.\nSomerset asking her if a young Englishman was or had been sketching\nthere. On receiving a reply in the negative, Paula nearly betrayed\nherself by turning, as if her business there, too, ended with the\ninformation. However, she went on again, and made a pretence of looking\nround, Mr. Somerset also staying in a spirit of friendly attention to\nhis countrywomen. They did not part from him till they had come out from\nthe crypt, and again reached the west front, on their way to which he\nadditionally explained that it was his son he was looking for, who had\narranged to meet him here, but had mentioned no inn at which he might be\nexpected.\n\nWhen he had left them, Paula informed her aunt whose company they had\nbeen sharing. Her aunt began expostulating with Paula for not telling\nMr. Somerset what they had seen of his son's movements. 'It would have\neased his mind at least,' she said.\n\n'I was not bound to ease his mind at the expense of showing what I would\nrather conceal. I am continually hampered in such generosity as that by\nthe circumstance of being a woman!'\n\n'Well, it is getting too late to search further tonight.'\n\nIt was indeed almost evening twilight in the streets, though the\ngraceful freestone spires to a depth of about twenty feet from their\nsummits were still dyed with the orange tints of a vanishing sun. The\ntwo relatives dined privately as usual, after which Paula looked out\nof the window of her room, and reflected upon the events of the day. A\ntower rising into the sky quite near at hand showed her that some church\nor other stood within a few steps of the hotel archway, and saying\nnothing to Mrs. Goodman, she quietly cloaked herself, and went out\ntowards it, apparently with the view of disposing of a portion of a dull\ndispiriting evening. The church was open, and on entering she found\nthat it was only lighted by seven candles burning before the altar of a\nchapel on the south side, the mass of the building being in deep\nshade. Motionless outlines, which resolved themselves into the forms\nof kneeling women, were darkly visible among the chairs, and in the\ntriforium above the arcades there was one hitherto unnoticed radiance,\ndim as that of a glow-worm in the grass. It was seemingly the effect of\na solitary tallow-candle behind the masonry.\n\nA priest came in, unlocked the door of a confessional with a click which\nsounded in the silence, and entered it; a woman followed, disappeared\nwithin the curtain of the same, emerging again in about five minutes,\nfollowed by the priest, who locked up his door with another loud click,\nlike a tradesman full of business, and came down the aisle to go out.\nIn the lobby he spoke to another woman, who replied, 'Ah, oui, Monsieur\nl'Abbe!'\n\nTwo women having spoken to him, there could be no harm in a third doing\nlikewise. 'Monsieur l'Abbe,' said Paula in French, 'could you indicate\nto me the stairs of the triforium?' and she signified her reason for\nwishing to know by pointing to the glimmering light above.\n\n'Ah, he is a friend of yours, the Englishman?' pleasantly said the\npriest, recognizing her nationality; and taking her to a little door he\nconducted her up a stone staircase, at the top of which he showed her\nthe long blind story over the aisle arches which led round to where the\nlight was. Cautioning her not to stumble over the uneven floor, he left\nher and descended. His words had signified that Somerset was here.\n\nIt was a gloomy place enough that she found herself in, but the seven\ncandles below on the opposite altar, and a faint sky light from the\nclerestory, lent enough rays to guide her. Paula walked on to the bend\nof the apse: here were a few chairs, and the origin of the light.\n\nThis was a candle stuck at the end of a sharpened stick, the latter\nentering a joint in the stones. A young man was sketching by the\nglimmer. But there was no need for the blush which had prepared\nitself beforehand; the young man was Mr. Cockton, Somerset's youngest\ndraughtsman.\n\nPaula could have cried aloud with disappointment. Cockton recognized\nMiss Power, and appearing much surprised, rose from his seat with a bow,\nand said hastily, 'Mr. Somerset left to-day.'\n\n'I did not ask for him,' said Paula.\n\n'No, Miss Power: but I thought--'\n\n'Yes, yes--you know, of course, that he has been my architect. Well, it\nhappens that I should like to see him, if he can call on me. Which way\ndid he go?'\n\n'He's gone to Etretat.'\n\n'What for? There are no abbeys to sketch at Etretat.'\n\nCockton looked at the point of his pencil, and with a hesitating motion\nof his lip answered, 'Mr. Somerset said he was tired.'\n\n'Of what?'\n\n'He said he was sick and tired of holy places, and would go to some\nwicked spot or other, to get that consolation which holiness could not\ngive. But he only said it casually to Knowles, and perhaps he did not\nmean it.'\n\n'Knowles is here too?'\n\n'Yes, Miss Power, and Bowles. Mr. Somerset has been kind enough to give\nus a chance of enlarging our knowledge of French Early-pointed, and pays\nhalf the expenses.'\n\nPaula said a few other things to the young man, walked slowly round\nthe triforium as if she had come to examine it, and returned down the\nstaircase. On getting back to the hotel she told her aunt, who had just\nbeen having a nap, that next day they would go to Etretat for a change.\n\n'Why? There are no old churches at Etretat.'\n\n'No. But I am sick and tired of holy places, and want to go to some\nwicked spot or other to find that consolation which holiness cannot\ngive.'\n\n'For shame, Paula! Now I know what it is; you have heard that he's gone\nthere! You needn't try to blind me.'\n\n'I don't care where he's gone!' cried Paula petulantly. In a moment,\nhowever, she smiled at herself, and added, 'You must take that for what\nit is worth. I have made up my mind to let him know from my own lips how\nthe misunderstanding arose. That done, I shall leave him, and probably\nnever see him again. My conscience will be clear.'\n\nThe next day they took the steamboat down the Orne, intending to\nreach Etretat by way of Havre. Just as they were moving off an elderly\ngentleman under a large white sunshade, and carrying his hat in his\nhand, was seen leisurely walking down the wharf at some distance, but\nobviously making for the boat.\n\n'A gentleman!' said the mate.\n\n'Who is he?' said the captain.\n\n'An English,' said Clementine.\n\nNobody knew more, but as leisure was the order of the day the engines\nwere stopped, on the chance of his being a passenger, and all eyes were\nbent upon him in conjecture. He disappeared and reappeared from behind\na pile of merchandise and approached the boat at an easy pace, whereupon\nthe gangway was replaced, and he came on board, removing his hat to\nPaula, quietly thanking the captain for stopping, and saying to Mrs.\nGoodman, 'I am nicely in time.'\n\nIt was Mr. Somerset the elder, who by degrees informed our travellers,\nas sitting on their camp-stools they advanced between the green banks\nbordered by elms, that he was going to Etretat; that the young man he\nhad spoken of yesterday had gone to that romantic watering-place instead\nof studying art at Caen, and that he was going to join him there.\n\nPaula preserved an entire silence as to her own intentions, partly from\nnatural reticence, and partly, as it appeared, from the difficulty of\nexplaining a complication which was not very clear to herself. At Havre\nthey parted from Mr. Somerset, and did not see him again till they were\ndriving over the hills towards Etretat in a carriage and four, when the\nwhite umbrella became visible far ahead among the outside passengers of\nthe coach to the same place. In a short time they had passed and cut in\nbefore this vehicle, but soon became aware that their carriage, like the\ncoach, was one of a straggling procession of conveyances, some mile and\na half in length, all bound for the village between the cliffs.\n\nIn descending the long hill shaded by lime-trees which sheltered their\nplace of destination, this procession closed up, and they perceived that\nall the visitors and native population had turned out to welcome\nthem, the daily arrival of new sojourners at this hour being the chief\nexcitement of Etretat. The coach which had preceded them all the way, at\nmore or less remoteness, was now quite close, and in passing along the\nvillage street they saw Mr. Somerset wave his hand to somebody in the\ncrowd below. A felt hat was waved in the air in response, the coach\nswept into the inn-yard, followed by the idlers, and all disappeared.\nPaula's face was crimson as their own carriage swept round in the\nopposite direction to the rival inn.\n\nOnce in her room she breathed like a person who had finished a long\nchase. They did not go down before dinner, but when it was almost dark\nPaula begged her aunt to wrap herself up and come with her to the shore\nhard by. The beach was deserted, everybody being at the Casino; the\ngate stood invitingly open, and they went in. Here the brilliantly lit\nterrace was crowded with promenaders, and outside the yellow palings,\nsurmounted by its row of lamps, rose the voice of the invisible sea.\nGroups of people were sitting under the verandah, the women mostly in\nwraps, for the air was growing chilly. Through the windows at their\nback an animated scene disclosed itself in the shape of a room-full of\nwaltzers, the strains of the band striving in the ear for mastery over\nthe sounds of the sea. The dancers came round a couple at a time, and\nwere individually visible to those people without who chose to look that\nway, which was what Paula did.\n\n'Come away, come away!' she suddenly said. 'It is not right for us to be\nhere.'\n\nHer exclamation had its origin in what she had at that moment seen\nwithin, the spectacle of Mr. George Somerset whirling round the room\nwith a young lady of uncertain nationality but pleasing figure. Paula\nwas not accustomed to show the white feather too clearly, but she soon\nhad passed out through those yellow gates and retreated, till the mixed\nmusic of sea and band had resolved into that of the sea alone.\n\n'Well!' said her aunt, half in soliloquy, 'do you know who I saw dancing\nthere, Paula? Our Mr. Somerset, if I don't make a great mistake!'\n\n'It was likely enough that you did,' sedately replied her niece. 'He\nleft Caen with the intention of seeking distractions of a lighter kind\nthan those furnished by art, and he has merely succeeded in finding\nthem. But he has made my duty rather a difficult one. Still, it was\nmy duty, for I very greatly wronged him. Perhaps, however, I have done\nenough for honour's sake. I would have humiliated myself by an apology\nif I had found him in any other situation; but, of course, one can't he\nexpected to take MUCH trouble when he is seen going on like that!'\n\nThe coolness with which she began her remarks had developed into\nsomething like warmth as she concluded.\n\n'He is only dancing with a lady he probably knows very well.'\n\n'He doesn't know her! The idea of his dancing with a woman of that\ndescription! We will go away tomorrow. This place has been greatly\nover-praised.'\n\n'The place is well enough, as far as I can see.'\n\n'He is carrying out his programme to the letter. He plunges into\nexcitement in the most reckless manner, and I tremble for the\nconsequences! I can do no more: I have humiliated myself into following\nhim, believing that in giving too ready credence to appearances I had\nbeen narrow and inhuman, and had caused him much misery. But he does not\nmind, and he has no misery; he seems just as well as ever. How much this\nfinding him has cost me! After all, I did not deceive him. He must\nhave acquired a natural aversion for me. I have allowed myself to be\ninterested in a man of very common qualities, and am now bitterly alive\nto the shame of having sought him out. I heartily detest him! I will\ngo back--aunt, you are right--I had no business to come.... His light\nconduct has rendered him uninteresting to me!'\n\n\n\nIII.\n\nWhen she rose the next morning the bell was clanging for the second\nbreakfast, and people were pouring in from the beach in every variety\nof attire. Paula, whom a restless night had left with a headache,\nwhich, however, she said nothing about, was reluctant to emerge from the\nseclusion of her chamber, till her aunt, discovering what was the matter\nwith her, suggested that a few minutes in the open air would refresh\nher; and they went downstairs into the hotel gardens.\n\nThe clatter of the big breakfast within was audible from this spot, and\nthe noise seemed suddenly to inspirit Paula, who proposed to enter.\nHer aunt assented. In the verandah under which they passed was a rustic\nhat-stand in the form of a tree, upon which hats and other body-gear\nhung like bunches of fruit. Paula's eye fell upon a felt hat to which\na small block-book was attached by a string. She knew that hat and\nblock-book well, and turning to Mrs. Goodman said, 'After all, I don't\nwant the breakfast they are having: let us order one of our own as\nusual. And we'll have it here.'\n\nShe led on to where some little tables were placed under the tall\nshrubs, followed by her aunt, who was in turn followed by the\nproprietress of the hotel, that lady having discovered from the French\nmaid that there was good reason for paying these ladies ample personal\nattention.\n\n'Is the gentleman to whom that sketch-book belongs staying here?' Paula\ncarelessly inquired, as she indicated the object on the hat-stand.\n\n'Ah, no!' deplored the proprietress. 'The Hotel was full when Mr.\nSomerset came. He stays at a cottage beyond the Rue Anicet Bourgeois: he\nonly has his meals here.'\n\nPaula had taken her seat under the fuchsia-trees in such a manner that\nshe could observe all the exits from the salle a manger; but for the\npresent none of the breakfasters emerged, the only moving objects on the\nscene being the waitresses who ran hither and thither across the court,\nthe cook's assistants with baskets of long bread, and the laundresses\nwith baskets of sun-bleached linen. Further back towards the inn-yard,\nstablemen were putting in the horses for starting the flys and coaches\nto Les Ifs, the nearest railway-station.\n\n'Suppose the Somersets should be going off by one of these conveyances,'\nsaid Mrs. Goodman as she sipped her tea.\n\n'Well, aunt, then they must,' replied the younger lady with composure.\n\nNevertheless she looked with some misgiving at the nearest stableman as\nhe led out four white horses, harnessed them, and leisurely brought a\nbrush with which he began blacking their yellow hoofs. All the vehicles\nwere ready at the door by the time breakfast was over, and the inmates\nsoon turned out, some to mount the omnibuses and carriages, some to\nramble on the adjacent beach, some to climb the verdant slopes, and some\nto make for the cliffs that shut in the vale. The fuchsia-trees which\nsheltered Paula's breakfast-table from the blaze of the sun, also\nscreened it from the eyes of the outpouring company, and she sat on\nwith her aunt in perfect comfort, till among the last of the stream came\nSomerset and his father. Paula reddened at being so near the former at\nlast. It was with sensible relief that she observed them turn towards\nthe cliffs and not to the carriages, and thus signify that they were not\ngoing off that day.\n\nNeither of the two saw the ladies, and when the latter had finished\ntheir tea and coffee they followed to the shore, where they sat for\nnearly an hour, reading and watching the bathers. At length footsteps\ncrunched among the pebbles in their vicinity, and looking out from her\nsunshade Paula saw the two Somersets close at hand.\n\nThe elder recognized her, and the younger, observing his father's action\nof courtesy, turned his head. It was a revelation to Paula, for she was\nshocked to see that he appeared worn and ill. The expression of his\nface changed at sight of her, increasing its shade of paleness; but he\nimmediately withdrew his eyes and passed by.\n\nSomerset was as much surprised at encountering her thus as she had been\ndistressed to see him. As soon as they were out of hearing, he asked his\nfather quietly, 'What strange thing is this, that Lady De Stancy should\nbe here and her husband not with her? Did she bow to me, or to you?'\n\n'Lady De Stancy--that young lady?' asked the puzzled painter. He\nproceeded to explain all he knew; that she was a young lady he had met\non his journey at two or three different times; moreover, that if\nshe were his son's client--the woman who was to have become Lady De\nStancy--she was Miss Power still; for he had seen in some newspaper\ntwo days before leaving England that the wedding had been postponed on\naccount of her illness.\n\nSomerset was so greatly moved that he could hardly speak connectedly to\nhis father as they paced on together. 'But she is not ill, as far as I\ncan see,' he said. 'The wedding postponed?--You are sure the word was\npostponed?--Was it broken off?'\n\n'No, it was postponed. I meant to have told you before, knowing you\nwould be interested as the castle architect; but it slipped my memory in\nthe bustle of arriving.'\n\n'I am not the castle architect.'\n\n'The devil you are not--what are you then?'\n\n'Well, I am not that.'\n\nSomerset the elder, though not of penetrating nature, began to see that\nhere lay an emotional complication of some sort, and reserved further\ninquiry till a more convenient occasion. They had reached the end of\nthe level beach where the cliff began to rise, and as this impediment\nnaturally stopped their walk they retraced their steps. On again nearing\nthe spot where Paula and her aunt were sitting, the painter would have\ndeviated to the hotel; but as his son persisted in going straight on, in\ndue course they were opposite the ladies again. By this time Miss\nPower, who had appeared anxious during their absence, regained her\nself-control. Going towards her old lover she said, with a smile, 'I\nhave been looking for you!'\n\n'Why have you been doing that?' said Somerset, in a voice which he\nfailed to keep as steady as he could wish.\n\n'Because--I want some architect to continue the restoration. Do you\nwithdraw your resignation?'\n\nSomerset appeared unable to decide for a few instants. 'Yes,' he then\nanswered.\n\nFor the moment they had ignored the presence of the painter and Mrs.\nGoodman, but Somerset now made them known to one another, and there was\nfriendly intercourse all round.\n\n'When will you be able to resume operations at the castle?' she asked,\nas soon as she could again speak directly to Somerset.\n\n'As soon as I can get back. Of course I only resume it at your special\nrequest.'\n\n'Of course.' To one who had known all the circumstances it would have\nseemed a thousand pities that, after again getting face to face with\nhim, she did not explain, without delay, the whole mischief that\nhad separated them. But she did not do it--perhaps from the inherent\nawkwardness of such a topic at this idle time. She confined herself\nsimply to the above-mentioned business-like request, and when the party\nhad walked a few steps together they separated, with mutual promises to\nmeet again.\n\n'I hope you have explained your mistake to him, and how it arose, and\neverything?' said her aunt when they were alone.\n\n'No, I did not.'\n\n'What, not explain after all?' said her amazed relative.\n\n'I decided to put it off.'\n\n'Then I think you decided very wrongly. Poor young man, he looked so\nill!'\n\n'Did you, too, think he looked ill? But he danced last night. Why did he\ndance?' She turned and gazed regretfully at the corner round which the\nSomersets had disappeared.\n\n'I don't know why he danced; but if I had known you were going to be so\nsilent, I would have explained the mistake myself.'\n\n'I wish you had. But no; I have said I would; and I must.'\n\nPaula's avoidance of tables d'hote did not extend to the present one.\nIt was quite with alacrity that she went down; and with her entry the\nantecedent hotel beauty who had reigned for the last five days at that\nmeal, was unceremoniously deposed by the guests. Mr. Somerset the elder\ncame in, but nobody with him. His seat was on Paula's left hand, Mrs.\nGoodman being on Paula's right, so that all the conversation was between\nthe Academician and the younger lady. When the latter had again retired\nupstairs with her aunt, Mrs. Goodman expressed regret that young Mr.\nSomerset was absent from the table. 'Why has he kept away?' she asked.\n\n'I don't know--I didn't ask,' said Paula sadly. 'Perhaps he doesn't care\nto meet us again.'\n\n'That's because you didn't explain.'\n\n'Well--why didn't the old man give me an opportunity?' exclaimed the\nniece with suppressed excitement. 'He would scarcely say anything but\nyes and no, and gave me no chance at all of introducing the subject. I\nwanted to explain--I came all the way on purpose--I would have begged\nGeorge's pardon on my two knees if there had been any way of beginning;\nbut there was not, and I could not do it!'\n\nThough she slept badly that night, Paula promptly appeared in the public\nroom to breakfast, and that not from motives of vanity; for, while not\nunconscious of her accession to the unstable throne of queen-beauty in\nthe establishment, she seemed too preoccupied to care for the honour\njust then, and would readily have changed places with her unhappy\npredecessor, who lingered on in the background like a candle after\nsunrise.\n\nMrs. Goodman was determined to trust no longer to Paula for putting an\nend to what made her so restless and self-reproachful. Seeing old Mr.\nSomerset enter to a little side-table behind for lack of room at the\ncrowded centre tables, again without his son, she turned her head and\nasked point-blank where the young man was.\n\nMr. Somerset's face became a shade graver than before. 'My son is\nunwell,' he replied; 'so unwell that he has been advised to stay indoors\nand take perfect rest.'\n\n'I do hope it is nothing serious.'\n\n'I hope so too. The fact is, he has overdone himself a little. He was\nnot well when he came here; and to make himself worse he must needs go\ndancing at the Casino with this lady and that--among others with a young\nAmerican lady who is here with her family, and whom he met in London\nlast year. I advised him against it, but he seemed desperately\ndetermined to shake off lethargy by any rash means, and wouldn't listen\nto me. Luckily he is not in the hotel, but in a quiet cottage a hundred\nyards up the hill.'\n\nPaula, who had heard all, did not show or say what she felt at the news:\nbut after breakfast, on meeting the landlady in a passage alone, she\nasked with some anxiety if there were a really skilful medical man in\nEtretat; and on being told that there was, and his name, she went back\nto look for Mr. Somerset; but he had gone.\n\nThey heard nothing more of young Somerset all that morning, but towards\nevening, while Paula sat at her window, looking over the heads of\nfuchsias upon the promenade beyond, she saw the painter walk by. She\nimmediately went to her aunt and begged her to go out and ask Mr.\nSomerset if his son had improved.\n\n'I will send Milly or Clementine,' said Mrs. Goodman.\n\n'I wish you would see him yourself.'\n\n'He has gone on. I shall never find him.'\n\n'He has only gone round to the front,' persisted Paula. 'Do walk that\nway, auntie, and ask him.'\n\nThus pressed, Mrs. Goodman acquiesced, and brought back intelligence to\nMiss Power, who had watched them through the window, that his son did\nnot positively improve, but that his American friends were very kind to\nhim.\n\nHaving made use of her aunt, Paula seemed particularly anxious to get\nrid of her again, and when that lady sat down to write letters, Paula\nwent to her own room, hastily dressed herself without assistance, asked\nprivately the way to the cottage, and went off thitherward unobserved.\n\nAt the upper end of the lane she saw a little house answering to the\ndescription, whose front garden, window-sills, palings, and doorstep\nwere literally ablaze with nasturtiums in bloom.\n\nShe entered this inhabited nosegay, quietly asked for the invalid, and\nif he were well enough to see Miss Power. The woman of the house soon\nreturned, and she was conducted up a crooked staircase to Somerset's\nmodest apartments. It appeared that some rooms in this dwelling had\nbeen furnished by the landlady of the inn, who hired them of the tenant\nduring the summer season to use as an annexe to the hotel.\n\nAdmitted to the outer room she beheld her architect looking as\nunarchitectural as possible; lying on a small couch which was drawn up\nto the open casement, whence he had a back view of the window flowers,\nand enjoyed a green transparency through the undersides of the same\nnasturtium leaves that presented their faces to the passers without.\n\nWhen the latch had again clicked into the catch of the closed door Paula\nwent up to the invalid, upon whose pale and interesting face a flush had\narisen simultaneously with the announcement of her name. He would have\nsprung up to receive her, but she pressed him down, and throwing\nall reserve on one side for the first time in their intercourse, she\ncrouched beside the sofa, whispering with roguish solicitude, her face\nnot too far from his own: 'How foolish you are, George, to get ill just\nnow when I have been wanting so much to see you again!--I am so sorry to\nsee you like this--what I said to you when we met on the shore was not\nwhat I had come to say!'\n\nSomerset took her by the hand. 'Then what did you come to say, Paula?'\nhe asked.\n\n'I wanted to tell you that the mere wanton wandering of a capricious\nmind was not the cause of my estrangement from you. There has been a\ngreat deception practised--the exact nature of it I cannot tell you\nplainly just at present; it is too painful--but it is all over, and\nI can assure you of my sorrow at having behaved as I did, and of my\nsincere friendship now as ever.'\n\n'There is nothing I shall value so much as that. It will make my work at\nthe castle very pleasant to feel that I can consult you about it without\nfear of intruding on you against your wishes.'\n\n'Yes, perhaps it will. But--you do not comprehend me.'\n\n'You have been an enigma always.'\n\n'And you have been provoking; but never so provoking as now. I wouldn't\nfor the world tell you the whole of my fancies as I came hither this\nevening: but I should think your natural intuition would suggest what\nthey were.'\n\n'It does, Paula. But there are motives of delicacy which prevent my\nacting on what is suggested to me.'\n\n'Delicacy is a gift, and you should thank God for it; but in some cases\nit is not so precious as we would persuade ourselves.'\n\n'Not when the woman is rich, and the man is poor?'\n\n'O, George Somerset--be cold, or angry, or anything, but don't be\nlike this! It is never worth a woman's while to show regret for her\ninjustice; for all she gets by it is an accusation of want of delicacy.'\n\n'Indeed I don't accuse you of that--I warmly, tenderly thank you for\nyour kindness in coming here to see me.'\n\n'Well, perhaps you do. But I am now in I cannot tell what mood--I will\nnot tell what mood, for it would be confessing more than I ought. This\nfinding you out is a piece of weakness that I shall not repeat; and I\nhave only one thing more to say. I have served you badly, George, I know\nthat; but it is never too late to mend; and I have come back to you.\nHowever, I shall never run after you again, trust me for that, for it is\nnot the woman's part. Still, before I go, that there may be no mistake\nas to my meaning, and misery entailed on us for want of a word, I'll add\nthis: that if you want to marry me, as you once did, you must say so;\nfor I am here to be asked.'\n\nIt would be superfluous to transcribe Somerset's reply, and the\nremainder of the scene between the pair. Let it suffice that\nhalf-an-hour afterwards, when the sun had almost gone down, Paula walked\nbriskly into the hotel, troubled herself nothing about dinner, but went\nupstairs to their sitting-room, where her aunt presently found her upon\nthe couch looking up at the ceiling through her fingers. They talked on\ndifferent subjects for some time till the old lady said 'Mr. Somerset's\ncottage is the one covered with flowers up the lane, I hear.'\n\n'Yes,' said Paula.\n\n'How do you know?'\n\n'I've been there.... We are going to be married, aunt.'\n\n'Indeed!' replied Mrs. Goodman. 'Well, I thought this might be the end\nof it: you were determined on the point; and I am not much surprised at\nyour news. Your father was very wise after all in entailing everything\nso strictly upon your offspring; for if he had not I should have been\ndriven wild with the responsibility!'\n\n'And now that the murder is out,' continued Paula, passing over that\nview of the case, 'I don't mind telling you that somehow or other I have\ngot to like George Somerset as desperately as a woman can care for any\nman. I thought I should have died when I saw him dancing, and feared\nI had lost him! He seemed ten times nicer than ever then! So silly we\nwomen are, that I wouldn't marry a duke in preference to him. There,\nthat's my honest feeling, and you must make what you can of it; my\nconscience is clear, thank Heaven!'\n\n'Have you fixed the day?'\n\n'No,' continued the young lady, still watching the sleeping flies on the\nceiling. 'It is left unsettled between us, while I come and ask you if\nthere would be any harm--if it could conveniently be before we return to\nEngland?'\n\n'Paula, this is too precipitate!'\n\n'On the contrary, aunt. In matrimony, as in some other things, you\nshould be slow to decide, but quick to execute. Nothing on earth would\nmake me marry another man; I know every fibre of his character; and\nhe knows a good many fibres of mine; so as there is nothing more to be\nlearnt, why shouldn't we marry at once? On one point I am firm: I will\nnever return to that castle as Miss Power. A nameless dread comes over\nme when I think of it--a fear that some uncanny influence of the dead\nDe Stancys would drive me again from him. O, if it were to do that,'\nshe murmured, burying her face in her hands, 'I really think it would be\nmore than I could bear!'\n\n'Very well,' said Mrs. Goodman; 'we will see what can be done. I will\nwrite to Mr. Wardlaw.'\n\n\n\nIV.\n\nOn a windy afternoon in November, when more than two months had closed\nover the incidents previously recorded, a number of farmers were sitting\nin a room of the Lord-Quantock-Arms Inn, Markton, that was used for the\nweekly ordinary. It was a long, low apartment, formed by the union of\ntwo or three smaller rooms, with a bow-window looking upon the street,\nand at the present moment was pervaded by a blue fog from tobacco-pipes,\nand a temperature like that of a kiln. The body of farmers who still\nsat on there was greater than usual, owing to the cold air without, the\ntables having been cleared of dinner for some time and their surface\nstamped with liquid circles by the feet of the numerous glasses.\n\nBesides the farmers there were present several professional men of\nthe town, who found it desirable to dine here on market-days for the\nopportunity it afforded them of increasing their practice among the\nagriculturists, many of whom were men of large balances, even luxurious\nlivers, who drove to market in elegant phaetons drawn by horses of\nsupreme blood, bone, and action, in a style never anticipated by their\nfathers when jogging thither in light carts, or afoot with a butter\nbasket on each arm.\n\nThe buzz of groggy conversation was suddenly impinged on by the notes of\na peal of bells from the tower hard by. Almost at the same instant the\ndoor of the room opened, and there entered the landlord of the little\ninn at Sleeping-Green. Drawing his supply of cordials from this superior\nhouse, to which he was subject, he came here at stated times like a\nprebendary to the cathedral of his diocesan, afterwards retailing to\nhis own humbler audience the sentiments which he had learnt of this. But\ncuriosity being awakened by the church bells the usual position was for\nthe moment reversed, and one of the farmers, saluting him by name, asked\nhim the reason of their striking up at that time of day.\n\n'My mis'ess out yonder,' replied the rural landlord, nodding sideways,\n'is coming home with her fancy-man. They have been a-gaying together\nthis turk of a while in foreign parts--Here, maid!--what with the wind,\nand standing about, my blood's as low as water--bring us a thimbleful of\nthat that isn't gin and not far from it.'\n\n'It is true, then, that she's become Mrs. Somerset?' indifferently asked\na farmer in broadcloth, tenant of an estate in quite another direction\nthan hers, as he contemplated the grain of the table immediately\nsurrounding the foot of his glass.\n\n'True--of course it is,' said Havill, who was also present, in the tone\nof one who, though sitting in this rubicund company, was not of it. 'I\ncould have told you the truth of it any day these last five weeks.'\n\nAmong those who had lent an ear was Dairyman Jinks, an old gnarled\ncharacter who wore a white fustian coat and yellow leggings; the only\nman in the room who never dressed up in dark clothes for marketing. He\nnow asked, 'Married abroad, was they? And how long will a wedding abroad\nstand good for in this country?'\n\n'As long as a wedding at home.'\n\n'Will it? Faith; I didn't know: how should I? I thought it might be some\nnew plan o' folks for leasing women now they be so plentiful, so as to\nget rid o' 'em when the men be tired o' 'em, and hev spent all their\nmoney.'\n\n'He won't be able to spend her money,' said the landlord of\nSleeping-Green. ''Tis her very own person's--settled upon the hairs of\nher head for ever.'\n\n'O nation! Then if I were the man I shouldn't care for such a one-eyed\nbenefit as that,' said Dairyman Jinks, turning away to listen to the\ntalk on his other hand.\n\n'Is that true?' asked the gentleman-farmer in broadcloth.\n\n'It is sufficiently near the truth,' said Havill. 'There is nothing at\nall unusual in the arrangement; it was only settled so to prevent any\nschemer making a beggar of her. If Somerset and she have any children,\nwhich probably they will, it will be theirs; and what can a man want\nmore? Besides, there is a large portion of property left to her personal\nuse--quite as much as they can want. Oddly enough, the curiosities\nand pictures of the castle which belonged to the De Stancys are not\nrestricted from sale; they are hers to do what she likes with. Old Power\ndidn't care for articles that reminded him so much of his predecessors.'\n\n'Hey?' said Dairyman Jinks, turning back again, having decided that the\nconversation on his right hand was, after all, the more interesting.\n'Well--why can't 'em hire a travelling chap to touch up the picters into\nher own gaffers and gammers? Then they'd be worth sommat to her.'\n\n'Ah, here they are? I thought so,' said Havill, who had been standing up\nat the window for the last few moments. 'The ringers were told to begin\nas soon as the train signalled.'\n\nAs he spoke a carriage drew up to the hotel-door, followed by another\nwith the maid and luggage. The inmates crowded to the bow-window, except\nDairyman Jinks, who had become absorbed in his own reflections.\n\n'What be they stopping here for?' asked one of the previous speakers.\n\n'They are going to stay here to-night,' said Havill. 'They have come\nquite unexpectedly, and the castle is in such a state of turmoil that\nthere is not a single carpet down, or room for them to use. We shall get\ntwo or three in order by next week.'\n\n'Two little people like them will be lost in the chammers of that\nwandering place!' satirized Dairyman Jinks. 'They will be bound to have\na randy every fortnight to keep the moth out of the furniture!'\n\nBy this time Somerset was handing out the wife of his bosom, and\nDairyman Jinks went on: 'That's no more Miss Power that was, than my\nniece's daughter Kezia is Miss Power--in short it is a different woman\naltogether!'\n\n'There is no mistake about the woman,' said the landlord; 'it is her fur\nclothes that make her look so like a caterpillar on end. Well, she is\nnot a bad bargain! As for Captain De Stancy, he'll fret his gizzard\ngreen.'\n\n'He's the man she ought to ha' married,' declared the farmer in\nbroadcloth. 'As the world goes she ought to have been Lady De Stancy.\nShe gave up her chapel-going, and you might have thought she would\nhave given up her first young man: but she stuck to him, though by all\naccounts he would soon have been interested in another party.'\n\n''Tis woman's nature to be false except to a man, and man's nature to be\ntrue except to a woman,' said the landlord of Sleeping-Green. 'However,\nall's well that ends well, and I have something else to think of than\nnew-married couples;' saying which the speaker moved off, and the\nothers returned to their seats, the young pair who had been their theme\nvanishing through the hotel into some private paradise to rest and dine.\n\nBy this time their arrival had become known, and a crowd soon gathered\noutside, acquiring audacity with continuance there. Raising a hurrah,\nthe group would not leave till Somerset had showed himself on the\nbalcony above; and then declined to go away till Paula also had\nappeared; when, remarking that her husband seemed a quiet young man\nenough, and would make a very good borough member when their present one\nmisbehaved himself, the assemblage good-humouredly dispersed.\n\n\n\nAmong those whose ears had been reached by the hurrahs of these idlers\nwas a man in silence and solitude, far out of the town. He was leaning\nover a gate that divided two meads in a watery level between Stancy\nCastle and Markton. He turned his head for a few seconds, then continued\nhis contemplative gaze towards the towers of the castle, visible over\nthe trees as far as was possible in the leaden gloom of the November\neve. The military form of the solitary lounger was recognizable as that\nof Sir William De Stancy, notwithstanding the failing light and his\nattitude of so resting his elbows on the gate that his hands enclosed\nthe greater part of his face.\n\nThe scene was inexpressibly cheerless. No other human creature was\napparent, and the only sounds audible above the wind were those of the\ntrickling streams which distributed the water over the meadow. A heron\nhad been standing in one of these rivulets about twenty yards from\nthe officer, and they vied with each other in stillness till the bird\nsuddenly rose and flew off to the plantation in which it was his custom\nto pass the night with others of his tribe. De Stancy saw the heron\nrise, and seemed to imagine the creature's departure without a supper\nto be owing to the increasing darkness; but in another minute he became\nconscious that the heron had been disturbed by sounds too distant to\nreach his own ears at the time. They were nearer now, and there came\nalong under the hedge a young man known to De Stancy exceedingly well.\n\n'Ah,' he said listlessly, 'you have ventured back.'\n\n'Yes, captain. Why do you walk out here?'\n\n'The bells began ringing because she and he were expected, and my\nthoughts naturally dragged me this way. Thank Heaven the battery leaves\nMarkton in a few days, and then the precious place will know me no\nmore!'\n\n'I have heard of it.' Turning to where the dim lines of the castle rose\nhe continued: 'Well, there it stands.'\n\n'And I am not in it.'\n\n'They are not in it yet either.'\n\n'They soon will be.'\n\n'Well--what tune is that you were humming, captain?'\n\n'ALL IS LOST NOW,' replied the captain grimly.\n\n'O no; you have got me, and I am a treasure to any man. I have another\nmatch in my eye for you, and shall get you well settled yet, if you keep\nyourself respectable. So thank God, and take courage!'\n\n'Ah, Will--you are a flippant young fool--wise in your own conceit; I\nsay it to my sorrow! 'Twas your dishonesty spoilt all. That lady would\nhave been my wife by fair dealing--time was all I required. But base\nattacks on a man's character never deserve to win, and if I had once\nbeen certain that you had made them, my course would have been very\ndifferent, both towards you and others. But why should I talk to you\nabout this? If I cared an atom what becomes of you I would take you in\nhand severely enough; not caring, I leave you alone, to go to the devil\nyour own way.'\n\n'Thank you kindly, captain. Well, since you have spoken plainly, I will\ndo the same. We De Stancys are a worn-out old party--that's the long\nand the short of it. We represent conditions of life that have had their\nday--especially me. Our one remaining chance was an alliance with new\naristocrats; and we have failed. We are past and done for. Our line has\nhad five hundred years of glory, and we ought to be content. Enfin les\nrenards se trouvent chez le pelletier.'\n\n'Speak for yourself, young Consequence, and leave the destinies of old\nfamilies to respectable philosophers. This fiasco is the direct result\nof evil conduct, and of nothing else at all. I have managed badly; I\ncountenanced you too far. When I saw your impish tendencies I should\nhave forsworn the alliance.'\n\n'Don't sting me, captain. What I have told you is true. As for my\nconduct, cat will after kind, you know. You should have held your tongue\non the wedding morning, and have let me take my chance.'\n\n'Is that all I get for saving you from jail? Gad--I alone am the\nsufferer, and feel I am alone the fool!... Come, off with you--I never\nwant to see you any more.'\n\n'Part we will, then--till we meet again. It will be a light night\nhereabouts, I think, this evening.'\n\n'A very dark one for me.'\n\n'Nevertheless, I think it will be a light night. Au revoir!'\n\nDare went his way, and after a while De Stancy went his. Both were soon\nlost in the shades.\n\n\n\nV.\n\nThe castle to-night was as gloomy as the meads. As Havill had explained,\nthe habitable rooms were just now undergoing a scour, and the main block\nof buildings was empty even of the few servants who had been retained,\nthey having for comfort's sake taken up their quarters in the detached\nrooms adjoining the entrance archway. Hence not a single light shone\nfrom the lonely windows, at which ivy leaves tapped like woodpeckers,\nmoved by gusts that were numerous and contrary rather than violent.\nWithin the walls all was silence, chaos, and obscurity, till towards\neleven o'clock, when the thick immovable cloud that had dulled the\ndaytime broke into a scudding fleece, through which the moon forded her\nway as a nebulous spot of watery white, sending light enough, though\nof a rayless kind, into the castle chambers to show the confusion that\nreigned there.\n\nAt this time an eye might have noticed a figure flitting in and about\nthose draughty apartments, and making no more noise in so doing than a\npuff of wind. Its motion hither and thither was rapid, but methodical,\nits bearing absorbed, yet cautious. Though it ran more or less through\nall the principal rooms, the chief scene of its operations was the Long\nGallery overlooking the Pleasance, which was covered by an ornamental\nwood-and-plaster roof, and contained a whole throng of family portraits,\nbesides heavy old cabinets and the like. The portraits which were of\nvalue as works of art were smaller than these, and hung in adjoining\nrooms.\n\nThe manifest occupation of the figure was that of removing these small\nand valuable pictures from other chambers to the gallery in which the\nrest were hung, and piling them in a heap in the midst. Included in the\ngroup were nine by Sir Peter Lely, five by Vandyck, four by Cornelius\nJansen, one by Salvator Rosa (remarkable as being among the few English\nportraits ever painted by that master), many by Kneller, and two\nby Romney. Apparently by accident, the light being insufficient to\ndistinguish them from portraits, the figure also brought a Raffaelle\nVirgin-and-Child, a magnificent Tintoretto, a Titian, and a Giorgione.\n\nOn these was laid a large collection of enamelled miniature portraits\nof the same illustrious line; afterwards tapestries and cushions\nembroidered with the initials 'De S.'; and next the cradle presented by\nCharles the First to the contemporary De Stancy mother, till at length\nthere arose in the middle of the floor a huge heap containing most of\nwhat had been personal and peculiar to members of the De Stancy family\nas distinct from general furniture.\n\nThen the figure went from door to door, and threw open each that was\nunfastened. It next proceeded to a room on the ground floor, at present\nfitted up as a carpenter's shop, and knee-deep in shavings. An armful of\nthese was added to the pile of objects in the gallery; a window at each\nend of the gallery was opened, causing a brisk draught along the walls;\nand then the activity of the figure ceased, and it was seen no more.\n\nFive minutes afterwards a light shone upon the lawn from the windows of\nthe Long Gallery, which glowed with more brilliancy than it had known in\nthe meridian of its Caroline splendours. Thereupon the framed gentleman\nin the lace collar seemed to open his eyes more widely; he with the\nflowing locks and turn-up mustachios to part his lips; he in the armour,\nwho was so much like Captain De Stancy, to shake the plates of his\nmail with suppressed laughter; the lady with the three-stringed pearl\nnecklace, and vast expanse of neck, to nod with satisfaction and\ntriumphantly signify to her adjoining husband that this was a meet and\nglorious end.\n\nThe flame increased, and blown upon by the wind roared round the\npictures, the tapestries, and the cradle, up to the plaster ceiling and\nthrough it into the forest of oak timbers above.\n\n\n\nThe best sitting-room at the Lord-Quantock-Arms in Markton was as cosy\nthis evening as a room can be that lacks the minuter furniture on which\ncosiness so largely depends. By the fire sat Paula and Somerset, the\nformer with a shawl round her shoulders to keep off the draught which,\ndespite the curtains, forced its way in on this gusty night through the\nwindows opening upon the balcony. Paula held a letter in her hand, the\ncontents of which formed the subject of their conversation. Happy as she\nwas in her general situation, there was for the nonce a tear in her eye.\n\n\n'MY EVER DEAR PAULA (ran the letter),--Your last letter has just reached\nme, and I have followed your account of your travels and intentions with\nmore interest than I can tell. You, who know me, need no assurance of\nthis. At the present moment, however, I am in the whirl of a change that\nhas resulted from a resolution taken some time ago, but concealed from\nalmost everybody till now. Why? Well, I will own--from cowardice--fear\nlest I should be reasoned out of my plan. I am going to steal from the\nworld, Paula, from the social world, for whose gaieties and ambitions\nI never had much liking, and whose circles I have not the ability to\ngrace. My home, and resting-place till the great rest comes, is with the\nProtestant Sisterhood at -----. Whatever shortcomings may be found in\nsuch a community, I believe that I shall be happier there than in any\nother place.\n\n'Whatever you may think of my judgment in taking this step, I can assure\nyou that I have not done it without consideration. My reasons are good,\nand my determination is unalterable. But, my own very best friend,\nand more than sister, don't think that I mean to leave my love and\nfriendship for you behind me. No, Paula, you will ALWAYS be with me,\nand I believe that if an increase in what I already feel for you be\npossible, it will be furthered by the retirement and meditation I shall\nenjoy in my secluded home. My heart is very full, dear--too full to\nwrite more. God bless you, and your husband. You must come and see me\nthere; I have not so many friends that I can afford to lose you who have\nbeen so kind. I write this with the fellow-pen to yours, that you gave\nme when we went to Budmouth together. Good-bye!--Ever your own sister,\nCHARLOTTE.'\n\n\nPaula had first read this through silently, and now in reading it a\nsecond time aloud to Somerset her voice faltered, and she wept outright.\n'I had been expecting her to live with us always,' she said through her\ntears, 'and to think she should have decided to do this!'\n\n'It is a pity certainly,' said Somerset gently. 'She was genuine, if\nanybody ever was; and simple as she was true.'\n\n'I am the more sorry,' Paula presently resumed, 'because of a little\nplan I had been thinking of with regard to her. You know that the\npictures and curiosities of the castle are not included in the things I\ncannot touch, or impeach, or whatever it is. They are our own to do\nwhat we like with. My father felt in devising the estate that, however\ninteresting to the De Stancys those objects might be, they did not\nconcern us--were indeed rather in the way, having been come by so\nstrangely, through Mr. Wilkins, though too valuable to be treated\nlightly. Now I was going to suggest that we would not sell them--indeed\nI could not bear to do such a thing with what had belonged to\nCharlotte's forefathers--but to hand them over to her as a gift, either\nto keep for herself, or to pass on to her brother, as she should choose.\nNow I fear there is no hope of it: and yet I shall never like to see\nthem in the house.'\n\n'It can be done still, I should think. She can accept them for her\nbrother when he settles, without absolutely taking them into her own\npossession.'\n\n'It would be a kind of generosity which hardly amounts to more than\njustice (although they were purchased) from a recusant usurper to a dear\nfriend--not that I am a usurper exactly; well, from a representative of\nthe new aristocracy of internationality to a representative of the old\naristocracy of exclusiveness.'\n\n'What do you call yourself, Paula, since you are not of your father's\ncreed?'\n\n'I suppose I am what poor Mr. Woodwell said--by the way, we must call\nand see him--something or other that's in Revelation, neither cold nor\nhot. But of course that's a sub-species--I may be a lukewarm anything.\nWhat I really am, as far as I know, is one of that body to whom\nlukewarmth is not an accident but a provisional necessity, till they see\na little more clearly.' She had crossed over to his side, and pulling\nhis head towards her whispered a name in his ear.\n\n'Why, Mr. Woodwell said you were that too! You carry your beliefs very\ncomfortably. I shall be glad when enthusiasm is come again.'\n\n'I am going to revise and correct my beliefs one of these days when I\nhave thought a little further.' She suddenly breathed a sigh and\nadded, 'How transitory our best emotions are! In talking of myself I am\nheartlessly forgetting Charlotte, and becoming happy again. I won't be\nhappy to-night for her sake!'\n\nA few minutes after this their attention was attracted by a noise of\nfootsteps running along the street; then a heavy tramp of horses, and\nlumbering of wheels. Other feet were heard scampering at intervals, and\nsoon somebody ascended the staircase and approached their door. The head\nwaiter appeared.\n\n'Ma'am, Stancy Castle is all afire!' said the waiter breathlessly.\n\nSomerset jumped up, drew aside the curtains, and stepped into the\nbow-window. Right before him rose a blaze. The window looked upon the\nstreet and along the turnpike road to the very hill on which the castle\nstood, the keep being visible in the daytime above the trees. Here\nrose the light, which appeared little further off than a stone's throw\ninstead of nearly three miles. Every curl of the smoke and every wave\nof the flame was distinct, and Somerset fancied he could hear the\ncrackling.\n\nPaula had risen from her seat and joined him in the window, where she\nheard some people in the street saying that the servants were all safe;\nafter which she gave her mind more fully to the material aspects of the\ncatastrophe.\n\nThe whole town was now rushing off to the scene of the conflagration,\nwhich, shining straight along the street, showed the burgesses' running\nfigures distinctly upon the illumined road. Paula was quite ready to act\nupon Somerset's suggestion that they too should hasten to the spot, and\na fly was got ready in a few minutes. With lapse of time Paula evinced\nmore anxiety as to the fate of her castle, and when they had driven as\nnear as it was prudent to do, they dismounted, and went on foot into\nthe throng of people which was rapidly gathering from the town and\nsurrounding villages. Among the faces they recognized Mr. Woodwell,\nHavill the architect, the rector of the parish, the curate, and many\nothers known to them by sight. These, as soon as they saw the young\ncouple, came forward with words of condolence, imagining them to have\nbeen burnt out of bed, and vied with each other in offering them a\nlodging. Somerset explained where they were staying and that they\nrequired no accommodation, Paula interrupting with 'O my poor horses,\nwhat has become of them?'\n\n'The fire is not near the stables,' said Mr. Woodwell. 'It broke out\nin the body of the building. The horses, however, are driven into the\nfield.'\n\n'I can assure you, you need not be alarmed, madam,' said Havill. 'The\nchief constable is here, and the two town engines, and I am doing all I\ncan. The castle engine unfortunately is out of repair.'\n\nSomerset and Paula then went on to another point of view near the\ngymnasium, where they could not be seen by the crowd. Three-quarters of\na mile off, on their left hand, the powerful irradiation fell upon the\nbrick chapel in which Somerset had first seen the woman who now\nstood beside him as his wife. It was the only object visible in that\ndirection, the dull hills and trees behind failing to catch the light.\nShe significantly pointed it out to Somerset, who knew her meaning, and\nthey turned again to the more serious matter.\n\nIt had long been apparent that in the face of such a wind all the pigmy\nappliances that the populace could bring to act upon such a mass of\ncombustion would be unavailing. As much as could burn that night was\nburnt, while some of that which would not burn crumbled and fell as\na formless heap, whence new flames towered up, and inclined to the\nnorth-east so far as to singe the trees of the park. The thicker walls\nof Norman date remained unmoved, partly because of their thickness, and\npartly because in them stone vaults took the place of wood floors.\n\nThe tower clock kept manfully going till it had struck one, its face\nsmiling out from the smoke as if nothing were the matter, after which\nhour something fell down inside, and it went no more.\n\nCunningham Haze, with his body of men, was devoted in his attention, and\ncame up to say a word to our two spectators from time to time. Towards\nfour o'clock the flames diminished, and feeling thoroughly weary,\nSomerset and Paula remained no longer, returning to Markton as they had\ncome.\n\nOn their journey they pondered and discussed what course it would be\nbest to pursue in the circumstances, gradually deciding not to attempt\nrebuilding the castle unless they were absolutely compelled. True,\nthe main walls were still standing as firmly as ever; but there was\na feeling common to both of them that it would be well to make an\nopportunity of a misfortune, and leaving the edifice in ruins start\ntheir married life in a mansion of independent construction hard by the\nold one, unencumbered with the ghosts of an unfortunate line.\n\n'We will build a new house from the ground, eclectic in style. We will\nremove the ashes, charred wood, and so on from the ruin, and plant more\nivy. The winter rains will soon wash the unsightly smoke from the walls,\nand Stancy Castle will be beautiful in its decay. You, Paula, will be\nyourself again, and recover, if you have not already, from the warp\ngiven to your mind (according to Woodwell) by the mediaevalism of that\nplace.'\n\n'And be a perfect representative of \"the modern spirit\"?' she inquired;\n'representing neither the senses and understanding, nor the heart and\nimagination; but what a finished writer calls \"the imaginative reason\"?'\n\n'Yes; for since it is rather in your line you may as well keep straight\non.'\n\n'Very well, I'll keep straight on; and we'll build a new house beside\nthe ruin, and show the modern spirit for evermore.... But, George, I\nwish--' And Paula repressed a sigh.\n\n'Well?'\n\n'I wish my castle wasn't burnt; and I wish you were a De Stancy!'\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Laodicean, by Thomas Hardy\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK A LAODICEAN ***\n\n***** This file should be named 3258.txt or 3258.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/3\/2\/5\/3258\/\n\nProduced by Les Bowler\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1345,"split":"test"}
