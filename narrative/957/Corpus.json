Morose, a wealthy old man with an obsessive hatred of noise, has made plans to disinherit his nephew Dauphine by marrying. His bride Epic\u0153ne is, he thinks, an exceptionally quiet woman; he does not know that Dauphine has arranged the whole match for purposes of his own.\nThe couple are married despite the well-meaning interference of Dauphine's friend True-wit. Morose soon regrets his wedding day, as his house is invaded by a charivari that comprises Dauphine, True-wit, and Clerimont; a bear warden named Otter and his wife; two stupid knights, La Foole and Daw; and an assortment of \"collegiates,\" vain and scheming women with intellectual pretensions. Worst for Morose, Epic\u0153ne quickly reveals herself as a loud, nagging mate.\nDesperate for a divorce, Morose consults two lawyers (actually Dauphine's men in disguise), but they can find no grounds for ending the match. Finally, Dauphine promises to reveal grounds to end the marriage (Morose must come to financial terms with him). The agreement made, Dauphine strips the female costume from Epic\u0153ne, revealing that the wife is, in fact, a boy. Morose is dismissed harshly, and the other ludicrous characters are discomfited by this revelation; Daw and Foole, for instance, had claimed to have slept with Epic\u0153ne.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Epicoene, by Ben Jonson\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Jonson's birthplace was Westminster, and the\ntime of his birth early in 1573.  He was thus nearly ten years\nShakespeare's junior, and less well off, if a trifle better born.\nBut Jonson did not profit even by this slight advantage.  His\nmother married beneath her, a wright or bricklayer, and Jonson was\nfor a time apprenticed to the trade.  As a youth he attracted the\nattention of the famous antiquary, William Camden, then usher at\nWestminster School, and there the poet laid the solid foundations\nof his classical learning.  Jonson always held Camden in\nveneration, acknowledging that to him he owed,\n\n\"All that I am in arts, all that I know;\"\n\nand dedicating his first dramatic success, \"Every Man in His\nHumour,\" to him.  It is doubtful whether Jonson ever went to either\nuniversity, though Fuller says that he was \"statutably admitted\ninto St. John's College, Cambridge.\"  He tells us that he took no\ndegree, but was later \"Master of Arts in both the universities, by\ntheir favour, not his study.\"  When a mere youth Jonson enlisted as\na soldier, trailing his pike in Flanders in the protracted wars of\nWilliam the Silent against the Spanish.  Jonson was a large and\nraw-boned lad; he became by his own account in time exceedingly\nbulky.  In chat with his friend William Drummond of Hawthornden,\nJonson told how \"in his service in the Low Countries he had, in the\nface of both the camps, killed an enemy, and taken opima spolia\nfrom him;\" and how \"since his coming to England, being appealed to\nthe fields, he had killed his adversary which had hurt him in the\narm and whose sword was ten inches longer than his.\"  Jonson's\nreach may have made up for the lack of his sword; certainly his\nprowess lost nothing in the telling.  Obviously Jonson was brave,\ncombative, and not averse to talking of himself and his doings.\n\nIn 1592, Jonson returned from abroad penniless.  Soon after he\nmarried, almost as early and quite as imprudently as Shakespeare.\nHe told Drummond curtly that \"his wife was a shrew, yet honest\";\nfor some years he lived apart from her in the household of Lord\nAlbany.  Yet two touching epitaphs among Jonson's \"Epigrams,\" \"On\nmy first daughter,\" and \"On my first son,\" attest the warmth of the\npoet's family affections.  The daughter died in infancy, the son of\nthe plague; another son grew up to manhood little credit to his\nfather whom he survived.  We know nothing beyond this of Jonson's\ndomestic life.\n\nHow soon Jonson drifted into what we now call grandly \"the\ntheatrical profession\" we do not know.  In 1593, Marlowe made his\ntragic exit from life, and Greene, Shakespeare's other rival on the\npopular stage, had preceded Marlowe in an equally miserable death\nthe year before.  Shakespeare already had the running to himself.\nJonson appears first in the employment of Philip Henslowe, the\nexploiter of several troupes of players, manager, and father-in-law\nof the famous actor, Edward Alleyn.  From entries in \"Henslowe's\nDiary,\" a species of theatrical account book which has been handed\ndown to us, we know that Jonson was connected with the Admiral's\nmen; for he borrowed 4 pounds of Henslowe, July 28, 1597, paying\nback 3s. 9d. on the same day on account of his \"share\" (in what is\nnot altogether clear); while later, on December 3, of the same\nyear, Henslowe advanced 20s. to him \"upon a book which he showed\nthe plot unto the company which he promised to deliver unto the\ncompany at Christmas next.\"  In the next August Jonson was in\ncollaboration with Chettle and Porter in a play called \"Hot Anger\nSoon Cold.\"  All this points to an association with Henslowe of\nsome duration, as no mere tyro would be thus paid in advance upon\nmere promise.  From allusions in Dekker's play, \"Satiromastix,\" it\nappears that Jonson, like Shakespeare, began life as an actor, and\nthat he \"ambled in a leather pitch by a play-wagon\" taking at one\ntime the part of Hieronimo in Kyd's famous play, \"The Spanish\nTragedy.\"  By the beginning of 1598, Jonson, though still in needy\ncircumstances, had begun to receive recognition.  Francis Meres --\nwell known for his \"Comparative Discourse of our English Poets with\nthe Greek, Latin, and Italian Poets,\" printed in 1598, and for his\nmention therein of a dozen plays of Shakespeare by title -- accords\nto Ben Jonson a place as one of \"our best in tragedy,\" a matter of\nsome surprise, as no known tragedy of Jonson from so early a date\nhas come down to us.  That Jonson was at work on tragedy, however,\nis proved by the entries in Henslowe of at least three tragedies,\nnow lost, in which he had a hand.  These are \"Page of Plymouth,\"\n\"King Robert II. of Scotland,\" and \"Richard Crookback.\"  But all of\nthese came later, on his return to Henslowe, and range from August\n1599 to June 1602.\n\nReturning to the autumn of 1598, an event now happened to sever for\na time Jonson's relations with Henslowe.  In a letter to Alleyn,\ndated September 26 of that year, Henslowe writes: \"I have lost one\nof my company that hurteth me greatly; that is Gabriel [Spencer],\nfor he is slain in Hogsden fields by the hands of Benjamin Jonson,\nbricklayer.\"  The last word is perhaps Henslowe's thrust at Jonson\nin his displeasure rather than a designation of his actual\ncontinuance at his trade up to this time.  It is fair to Jonson to\nremark however, that his adversary appears to have been a notorious\nfire-eater who had shortly before killed one Feeke in a similar\nsquabble.  Duelling was a frequent occurrence of the time among\ngentlemen and the nobility; it was an impudent breach of the peace\non the part of a player.  This duel is the one which Jonson\ndescribed years after to Drummond, and for it Jonson was duly\narraigned at Old Bailey, tried, and convicted.  He was sent to\nprison and such goods and chattels as he had \"were forfeited.\"  It\nis a thought to give one pause that, but for the ancient law\npermitting convicted felons to plead, as it was called, the benefit\nof clergy, Jonson might have been hanged for this deed.  The\ncircumstance that the poet could read and write saved him; and he\nreceived only a brand of the letter \"T,\" for Tyburn, on his left\nthumb.  While in jail Jonson became a Roman Catholic; but he\nreturned to the faith of the Church of England a dozen years later.\n\nOn his release, in disgrace with Henslowe and his former\nassociates, Jonson offered his services as a playwright to\nHenslowe's rivals, the Lord Chamberlain's company, in which\nShakespeare was a prominent shareholder.  A tradition of long\nstanding, though not susceptible of proof in a court of law,\nnarrates that Jonson had submitted the manuscript of \"Every Man in\nHis Humour\" to the Chamberlain's men and had received from the\ncompany a refusal; that Shakespeare called him back, read the play\nhimself, and at once accepted it.  Whether this story is true or\nnot, certain it is that \"Every Man in His Humour\" was accepted by\nShakespeare's company and acted for the first time in 1598, with\nShakespeare taking a part.  The evidence of this is contained in\nthe list of actors prefixed to the comedy in the folio of Jonson's\nworks, 1616.  But it is a mistake to infer, because Shakespeare's\nname stands first in the list of actors and the elder Kno'well\nfirst in the dramatis personae, that Shakespeare took that\nparticular part.  The order of a list of Elizabethan players was\ngenerally that of their importance or priority as shareholders in\nthe company and seldom if ever corresponded to the list of\ncharacters.\n\n\"Every Man in His Humour\" was an immediate success, and with it\nJonson's reputation as one of the leading dramatists of his time\nwas established once and for all.  This could have been by no means\nJonson's earliest comedy, and we have just learned that he was\nalready reputed one of \"our best in tragedy.\"  Indeed, one of\nJonson's extant comedies, \"The Case is Altered,\" but one never\nclaimed by him or published as his, must certainly have preceded\n\"Every Man in His Humour\" on the stage.  The former play may be\ndescribed as a comedy modelled on the Latin plays of Plautus.  (It\ncombines, in fact, situations derived from the \"Captivi\" and the\n\"Aulularia\" of that dramatist).  But the pretty story of the\nbeggar-maiden, Rachel, and her suitors, Jonson found, not among the\nclassics, but in the ideals of romantic love which Shakespeare had\nalready popularised on the stage.  Jonson never again produced so\nfresh and lovable a feminine personage as Rachel, although in other\nrespects \"The Case is Altered\" is not a conspicuous play, and, save\nfor the satirising of Antony Munday in the person of Antonio\nBalladino and Gabriel Harvey as well, is perhaps the least\ncharacteristic of the comedies of Jonson.\n\n\"Every Man in His Humour,\" probably first acted late in the summer\nof 1598 and at the Curtain, is commonly regarded as an epoch-making\nplay; and this view is not unjustified.  As to plot, it tells\nlittle more than how an intercepted letter enabled a father to\nfollow his supposedly studious son to London, and there observe his\nlife with the gallants of the time.  The real quality of this\ncomedy is in its personages and in the theory upon which they are\nconceived.  Ben Jonson had theories about poetry and the drama, and\nhe was neither chary in talking of them nor in experimenting with\nthem in his plays.  This makes Jonson, like Dryden in his time, and\nWordsworth much later, an author to reckon with; particularly when\nwe remember that many of Jonson's notions came for a time\ndefinitely to prevail and to modify the whole trend of English\npoetry.  First of all Jonson was a classicist, that is, he believed\nin restraint and precedent in art in opposition to the prevalent\nungoverned and irresponsible Renaissance spirit.  Jonson believed\nthat there was a professional way of doing things which might be\nreached by a study of the best examples, and he found these\nexamples for the most part among the ancients.  To confine our\nattention to the drama, Jonson objected to the amateurishness and\nhaphazard nature of many contemporary plays, and set himself to do\nsomething different; and the first and most striking thing that he\nevolved was his conception and practice of the comedy of humours.\n\nAs Jonson has been much misrepresented in this matter, let us quote\nhis own words as to \"humour.\"  A humour, according to Jonson, was a\nbias of disposition, a warp, so to speak, in character by which\n\n     \"Some one peculiar quality\n     Doth so possess a man, that it doth draw\n     All his affects, his spirits, and his powers,\n     In their confluctions, all to run one way.\"\n\nBut continuing, Jonson is careful to add:\n\n     \"But that a rook by wearing a pied feather,\n     The cable hat-band, or the three-piled ruff,\n     A yard of shoe-tie, or the Switzers knot\n     On his French garters, should affect a humour!\n     O, it is more than most ridiculous.\"\n\nJonson's comedy of humours, in a word, conceived of stage\npersonages on the basis of a ruling trait or passion (a notable\nsimplification of actual life be it observed in passing); and,\nplacing these typified traits in juxtaposition in their conflict\nand contrast, struck the spark of comedy. Downright, as his name\nindicates, is \"a plain squire\"; Bobadill's humour is that of the\nbraggart who is incidentally, and with delightfully comic effect, a\ncoward; Brainworm's humour is the finding out of things to the end\nof fooling everybody: of course he is fooled in the end himself.\nBut it was not Jonson's theories alone that made the success of\n\"Every Man in His Humour.\"  The play is admirably written and each\ncharacter is vividly conceived, and with a firm touch based on\nobservation of the men of the London of the day.  Jonson was\nneither in this, his first great comedy (nor in any other play that\nhe wrote), a supine classicist, urging that English drama return to\na slavish adherence to classical conditions.  He says as to the\nlaws of the old comedy (meaning by \"laws,\" such matters as the\nunities of time and place and the use of chorus): \"I see not then,\nbut we should enjoy the same licence, or free power to illustrate\nand heighten our invention as they [the ancients] did; and not be\ntied to those strict and regular forms which the niceness of a few,\nwho are nothing but form, would thrust upon us.\"  \"Every Man in His\nHumour\" is written in prose, a novel practice which Jonson had of\nhis predecessor in comedy, John Lyly.  Even the word \"humour\" seems\nto have been employed in the Jonsonian sense by Chapman before\nJonson's use of it.  Indeed, the comedy of humours itself is only a\nheightened variety of the comedy of manners which represents life,\nviewed at a satirical angle, and is the oldest and most persistent\nspecies of comedy in the language.  None the less, Jonson's comedy\nmerited its immediate success and marked out a definite course in\nwhich comedy long continued to run.  To mention only Shakespeare's\nFalstaff and his rout, Bardolph, Pistol, Dame Quickly, and the\nrest, whether in \"Henry IV.\" or in \"The Merry Wives of Windsor,\"\nall are conceived in the spirit of humours.  So are the captains,\nWelsh, Scotch, and Irish of \"Henry V.,\" and Malvolio especially\nlater; though Shakespeare never employed the method of humours for\nan important personage.  It was not Jonson's fault that many of his\nsuccessors did precisely the thing that he had reprobated, that is,\ndegrade the humour: into an oddity of speech, an eccentricity of\nmanner, of dress, or cut of beard.  There was an anonymous play\ncalled \"Every Woman in Her Humour.\"  Chapman wrote \"A Humourous\nDay's Mirth,\" Day, \"Humour Out of Breath,\" Fletcher later, \"The\nHumourous Lieutenant,\" and Jonson, besides \"Every Man Out of His\nHumour,\" returned to the title in closing the cycle of his comedies\nin \"The Magnetic Lady or Humours Reconciled.\"\n\nWith the performance of \"Every Man Out of His Humour\" in 1599, by\nShakespeare's company once more at the Globe, we turn a new page in\nJonson's career.  Despite his many real virtues, if there is one\nfeature more than any other that distinguishes Jonson, it is his\narrogance; and to this may be added his self-righteousness,\nespecially under criticism or satire.  \"Every Man Out of His\nHumour\" is the first of three \"comical satires\" which Jonson\ncontributed to what Dekker called the poetomachia or war of the\ntheatres as recent critics have named it.  This play as a fabric of\nplot is a very slight affair; but as a satirical picture of the\nmanners of the time, proceeding by means of vivid caricature,\ncouched in witty and brilliant dialogue and sustained by that\nrighteous indignation which must lie at the heart of all true\nsatire -- as a realisation, in short, of the classical ideal of\ncomedy -- there had been nothing like Jonson's comedy since the\ndays of Aristophanes.  \"Every Man in His Humour,\" like the two\nplays that follow it, contains two kinds of attack, the critical or\ngenerally satiric, levelled at abuses and corruptions in the\nabstract; and the personal, in which specific application is made\nof all this in the lampooning of poets and others, Jonson's\ncontemporaries.  The method of personal attack by actual caricature\nof a person on the stage is almost as old as the drama.\nAristophanes so lampooned Euripides in \"The Acharnians\" and\nSocrates in \"The Clouds,\" to mention no other examples; and in\nEnglish drama this kind of thing is alluded to again and again.\nWhat Jonson really did, was to raise the dramatic lampoon to an\nart, and make out of a casual burlesque and bit of mimicry a\ndramatic satire of literary pretensions and permanency.  With the\narrogant attitude mentioned above and his uncommon eloquence in\nscorn, vituperation, and invective, it is no wonder that Jonson\nsoon involved himself in literary and even personal quarrels with\nhis fellow-authors.  The circumstances of the origin of this\n'poetomachia' are far from clear, and those who have written on the\ntopic, except of late, have not helped to make them clearer.  The\norigin of the \"war\" has been referred to satirical references,\napparently to Jonson, contained in \"The Scourge of Villainy,\" a\nsatire in regular form after the manner of the ancients by John\nMarston, a fellow playwright, subsequent friend and collaborator of\nJonson's.  On the other hand, epigrams of Jonson have been\ndiscovered (49, 68, and 100) variously charging \"playwright\"\n(reasonably identified with Marston) with scurrility, cowardice,\nand plagiarism; though the dates of the epigrams cannot be\nascertained with certainty.  Jonson's own statement of the matter\nto Drummond runs: \"He had many quarrels with Marston, beat him,\nand took his pistol from him, wrote his \"Poetaster\" on him; the\nbeginning[s] of them were that Marston represented him on the\nstage.\"*\n\n[footnote] *The best account of this whole subject is to be found\nin the edition of \"Poetaster\" and \"Satiromastrix\" by J. H. Penniman\nin \"Belles Lettres Series\" shortly to appear.  See also his earlier\nwork, \"The War of the Theatres,\" 1892, and the excellent\ncontributions to the subject by H. C. Hart in \"Notes and Queries,\"\nand in his edition of Jonson, 1906.\n\nHere at least we are on certain ground; and the principals of the\nquarrel are known.  \"Histriomastix,\" a play revised by Marston in\n1598, has been regarded as the one in which Jonson was thus\n\"represented on the stage\"; although the personage in question,\nChrisogonus, a poet, satirist, and translator, poor but proud, and\ncontemptuous of the common herd, seems rather a complimentary\nportrait of Jonson than a caricature.  As to the personages\nactually ridiculed in \"Every Man Out of His Humour,\" Carlo Buffone\nwas formerly thought certainly to be Marston, as he was described\nas \"a public, scurrilous, and profane jester,\" and elsewhere as the\ngrand scourge or second untruss [that is, satirist], of the time\n(Joseph Hall being by his own boast the first, and Marston's work\nbeing entitled \"The Scourge of Villainy\").  Apparently we must now\nprefer for Carlo a notorious character named Charles Chester, of\nwhom gossipy and inaccurate Aubrey relates that he was \"a bold\nimpertinent fellow...a perpetual talker and made a noise like a\ndrum in a room.  So one time at a tavern Sir Walter Raleigh beats\nhim and seals up his mouth (that is his upper and nether beard)\nwith hard wax.  From him Ben Jonson takes his Carlo Buffone\n['i.e.', jester] in \"Every Man in His Humour\" ['sic'].\"  Is it\nconceivable that after all Jonson was ridiculing Marston, and that\nthe point of the satire consisted in an intentional confusion of\n\"the grand scourge or second untruss\" with \"the scurrilous and\nprofane\" Chester?\n\nWe have digressed into detail in this particular case to exemplify\nthe difficulties of criticism in its attempts to identify the\nallusions in these forgotten quarrels.  We are on sounder ground of\nfact in recording other manifestations of Jonson's enmity.  In \"The\nCase is Altered\" there is clear ridicule in the character Antonio\nBalladino of Anthony Munday, pageant-poet of the city, translator\nof romances and playwright as well.  In \"Every Man in His Humour\"\nthere is certainly a caricature of Samuel Daniel, accepted poet of\nthe court, sonneteer, and companion of men of fashion.  These men\nheld recognised positions to which Jonson felt his talents better\nentitled him; they were hence to him his natural enemies.  It seems\nalmost certain that he pursued both in the personages of his satire\nthrough \"Every Man Out of His Humour,\" and \"Cynthia's Revels,\"\nDaniel under the characters Fastidious Brisk and Hedon, Munday as\nPuntarvolo and Amorphus; but in these last we venture on quagmire\nonce more.  Jonson's literary rivalry of Daniel is traceable again\nand again, in the entertainments that welcomed King James on his\nway to London, in the masques at court, and in the pastoral drama.\nAs to Jonson's personal ambitions with respect to these two men, it\nis notable that he became, not pageant-poet, but chronologer to the\nCity of London; and that, on the accession of the new king, he came\nsoon to triumph over Daniel as the accepted entertainer of royalty.\n\n\"Cynthia's Revels,\" the second \"comical satire,\" was acted in 1600,\nand, as a play, is even more lengthy, elaborate, and impossible\nthan \"Every Man Out of His Humour.\"  Here personal satire seems to\nhave absorbed everything, and while much of the caricature is\nadmirable, especially in the detail of witty and trenchantly\nsatirical dialogue, the central idea of a fountain of self-love is\nnot very well carried out, and the persons revert at times to\nabstractions, the action to allegory.  It adds to our wonder that\nthis difficult drama should have been acted by the Children of\nQueen Elizabeth's Chapel, among them Nathaniel Field with whom\nJonson read Horace and Martial, and whom he taught later how to\nmake plays.  Another of these precocious little actors was\nSalathiel Pavy, who died before he was thirteen, already famed for\ntaking the parts of old men.  Him Jonson immortalised in one of the\nsweetest of his epitaphs.  An interesting sidelight is this on the\ncharacter of this redoubtable and rugged satirist, that he should\nthus have befriended and tenderly remembered these little\ntheatrical waifs, some of whom (as we know) had been literally\nkidnapped to be pressed into the service of the theatre and whipped\nto the conning of their difficult parts.  To the caricature of\nDaniel and Munday in \"Cynthia's Revels\" must be added Anaides\n(impudence), here assuredly Marston, and Asotus (the prodigal),\ninterpreted as Lodge or, more perilously, Raleigh.  Crites, like\nAsper-Macilente in \"Every Man Out of His Humour,\" is Jonson's\nself-complaisant portrait of himself, the just, wholly admirable,\nand judicious scholar, holding his head high above the pack of the\nyelping curs of envy and detraction, but careless of their puny\nattacks on his perfections with only too mindful a neglect.\n\nThe third and last of the \"comical satires\" is \"Poetaster,\" acted,\nonce more, by the Children of the Chapel in 1601, and Jonson's only\navowed contribution to the fray.  According to the author's own\naccount, this play was written in fifteen weeks on a report that\nhis enemies had entrusted to Dekker the preparation of\n\"Satiromastix, the Untrussing of the Humorous Poet,\" a dramatic\nattack upon himself.  In this attempt to forestall his enemies\nJonson succeeded, and \"Poetaster\" was an immediate and deserved\nsuccess.  While hardly more closely knit in structure than its\nearlier companion pieces, \"Poetaster\" is planned to lead up to the\nludicrous final scene in which, after a device borrowed from the\n\"Lexiphanes\" of Lucian, the offending poetaster, Marston-Crispinus,\nis made to throw up the difficult words with which he had\noverburdened his stomach as well as overlarded his vocabulary.  In\nthe end Crispinus with his fellow, Dekker-Demetrius, is bound over\nto keep the peace and never thenceforward \"malign, traduce, or\ndetract the person or writings of Quintus Horatius Flaccus [Jonson]\nor any other eminent man transcending you in merit.\"  One of the\nmost diverting personages in Jonson's comedy is Captain Tucca.\n\"His peculiarity\" has been well described by Ward as \"a buoyant\nblackguardism which recovers itself instantaneously from the most\ncomplete exposure, and a picturesqueness of speech like that of a\nwalking dictionary of slang.\"\n\nIt was this character, Captain Tucca, that Dekker hit upon in his\nreply, \"Satiromastix,\" and he amplified him, turning his abusive\nvocabulary back upon Jonson and adding \"an immodesty to his\ndialogue that did not enter into Jonson's conception.\"  It has been\nheld, altogether plausibly, that when Dekker was engaged\nprofessionally, so to speak, to write a dramatic reply to Jonson,\nhe was at work on a species of chronicle history, dealing with the\nstory of Walter Terill in the reign of William Rufus.  This he\nhurriedly adapted to include the satirical characters suggested by\n\"Poetaster,\" and fashioned to convey the satire of his reply.  The\nabsurdity of placing Horace in the court of a Norman king is the\nresult. But Dekker's play is not without its palpable hits at the\narrogance, the literary pride, and self-righteousness of\nJonson-Horace, whose \"ningle\" or pal, the absurd Asinius Bubo, has\nrecently been shown to figure forth, in all likelihood, Jonson's\nfriend, the poet Drayton.  Slight and hastily adapted as is\n\"Satiromastix,\" especially in a comparison with the better wrought\nand more significant satire of \"Poetaster,\" the town awarded the\npalm to Dekker, not to Jonson; and Jonson gave over in consequence\nhis practice of \"comical satire.\"  Though Jonson was cited to\nappear before the Lord Chief Justice to answer certain charges to\nthe effect that he had attacked lawyers and soldiers in\n\"Poetaster,\" nothing came of this complaint.  It may be suspected\nthat much of this furious clatter and give-and-take was pure\nplaying to the gallery.  The town was agog with the strife, and on\nno less an authority than Shakespeare (\"Hamlet,\" ii. 2), we learn\nthat the children's company (acting the plays of Jonson) did \"so\nberattle the common stages...that many, wearing rapiers, are afraid\nof goose-quills, and dare scarce come thither.\"\n\nSeveral other plays have been thought to bear a greater or less\npart in the war of the theatres.  Among them the most important is\na college play, entitled \"The Return from Parnassus,\" dating\n1601-02.  In it a much-quoted passage makes Burbage, as a\ncharacter, declare: \"Why here's our fellow Shakespeare puts them\nall down; aye and Ben Jonson, too.  O that Ben Jonson is a\npestilent fellow; he brought up Horace, giving the poets a pill,\nbut our fellow Shakespeare hath given him a purge that made him\nbewray his credit.\"  Was Shakespeare then concerned in this war of\nthe stages?  And what could have been the nature of this \"purge\"?\nAmong several suggestions, \"Troilus and Cressida\" has been thought\nby some to be the play in which Shakespeare thus \"put down\" his\nfriend, Jonson.  A wiser interpretation finds the \"purge\" in\n\"Satiromastix,\" which, though not written by Shakespeare, was\nstaged by his company, and therefore with his approval and under\nhis direction as one of the leaders of that company.\n\nThe last years of the reign of Elizabeth thus saw Jonson recognised\nas a dramatist second only to Shakespeare, and not second even to\nhim as a dramatic satirist.  But Jonson now turned his talents to\nnew fields.  Plays on subjects derived from classical story and\nmyth had held the stage from the beginning of the drama, so that\nShakespeare was making no new departure when he wrote his \"Julius\nCaesar\" about 1600.  Therefore when Jonson staged \"Sejanus,\" three\nyears later and with Shakespeare's company once more, he was only\nfollowing in the elder dramatist's footsteps.  But Jonson's idea of\na play on classical history, on the one hand, and Shakespeare's and\nthe elder popular dramatists, on the other, were very different.\nHeywood some years before had put five straggling plays on the\nstage in quick succession, all derived from stories in Ovid and\ndramatised with little taste or discrimination.  Shakespeare had a\nfiner conception of form, but even he was contented to take all his\nancient history from North's translation of Plutarch and dramatise\nhis subject without further inquiry. Jonson was a scholar and a\nclassical antiquarian.  He reprobated this slipshod amateurishness,\nand wrote his \"Sejanus\" like a scholar, reading Tacitus, Suetonius,\nand other authorities, to be certain of his facts, his setting, and\nhis atmosphere, and somewhat pedantically noting his authorities in\nthe margin when he came to print.  \"Sejanus\" is a tragedy of\ngenuine dramatic power in which is told with discriminating taste\nthe story of the haughty favourite of Tiberius with his tragical\noverthrow.  Our drama presents no truer nor more painstaking\nrepresentation of ancient Roman life than may be found in Jonson's\n\"Sejanus\" and \"Catiline his Conspiracy,\" which followed in 1611.  A\npassage in the address of the former play to the reader, in which\nJonson refers to a collaboration in an earlier version, has led to\nthe surmise that Shakespeare may have been that \"worthier pen.\"\nThere is no evidence to determine the matter.\n\nIn 1605, we find Jonson in active collaboration with Chapman and\nMarston in the admirable comedy of London life entitled \"Eastward\nHoe.\"  In the previous year, Marston had dedicated his\n\"Malcontent,\" in terms of fervid admiration, to Jonson; so that the\nwounds of the war of the theatres must have been long since healed.\nBetween Jonson and Chapman there was the kinship of similar\nscholarly ideals.  The two continued friends throughout life.\n\"Eastward Hoe\" achieved the extraordinary popularity represented in\na demand for three issues in one year.  But this was not due\nentirely to the merits of the play.  In its earliest version a\npassage which an irritable courtier conceived to be derogatory to\nhis nation, the Scots, sent both Chapman and Jonson to jail; but\nthe matter was soon patched up, for by this time Jonson had\ninfluence at court.\n\nWith the accession of King James, Jonson began his long and\nsuccessful career as a writer of masques.  He wrote more masques\nthan all his competitors together, and they are of an extraordinary\nvariety and poetic excellence.  Jonson did not invent the masque;\nfor such premeditated devices to set and frame, so to speak, a\ncourt ball had been known and practised in varying degrees of\nelaboration long before his time.  But Jonson gave dramatic value\nto the masque, especially in his invention of the antimasque, a\ncomedy or farcical element of relief, entrusted to professional\nplayers or dancers.  He enhanced, as well, the beauty and dignity\nof those portions of the masque in which noble lords and ladies\ntook their parts to create, by their gorgeous costumes and artistic\ngrouping and evolutions, a sumptuous show.  On the mechanical and\nscenic side Jonson had an inventive and ingenious partner in Inigo\nJones, the royal architect, who more than any one man raised the\nstandard of stage representation in the England of his day.  Jonson\ncontinued active in the service of the court in the writing of\nmasques and other entertainments far into the reign of King\nCharles; but, towards the end, a quarrel with Jones embittered his\nlife, and the two testy old men appear to have become not only a\nconstant irritation to each other, but intolerable bores at court.\nIn \"Hymenaei,\" \"The Masque of Queens,\" \"Love Freed from Ignorance,\"\n\"Lovers made Men,\" \"Pleasure Reconciled to Virtue,\" and many more\nwill be found Jonson's aptitude, his taste, his poetry and\ninventiveness in these by-forms of the drama; while in \"The Masque\nof Christmas,\" and \"The Gipsies Metamorphosed\" especially, is\ndiscoverable that power of broad comedy which, at court as well as\nin the city, was not the least element of Jonson's contemporary\npopularity.\n\nBut Jonson had by no means given up the popular stage when he\nturned to the amusement of King James.  In 1605 \"Volpone\" was\nproduced, \"The Silent Woman\" in 1609, \"The Alchemist\" in the\nfollowing year.  These comedies, with \"Bartholomew Fair,\" 1614,\nrepresent Jonson at his height, and for constructive cleverness,\ncharacter successfully conceived in the manner of caricature, wit\nand brilliancy of dialogue, they stand alone in English drama.\n\"Volpone, or the Fox,\" is, in a sense, a transition play from the\ndramatic satires of the war of the theatres to the purer comedy\nrepresented in the plays named above.  Its subject is a struggle of\nwit applied to chicanery; for among its dramatis personae, from\nthe villainous Fox himself, his rascally servant Mosca, Voltore\n(the vulture), Corbaccio and Corvino (the big and the little\nraven), to Sir Politic Would-be and the rest, there is scarcely a\nvirtuous character in the play.  Question has been raised as to\nwhether a story so forbidding can be considered a comedy, for,\nalthough the plot ends in the discomfiture and imprisonment of the\nmost vicious, it involves no mortal catastrophe.  But Jonson was on\nsound historical ground, for \"Volpone\" is conceived far more\nlogically on the lines of the ancients' theory of comedy than was\never the romantic drama of Shakespeare, however repulsive we may\nfind a philosophy of life that facilely divides the world into the\nrogues and their dupes, and, identifying brains with roguery and\ninnocence with folly, admires the former while inconsistently\npunishing them.\n\n\"The Silent Woman\" is a gigantic farce of the most ingenious\nconstruction.  The whole comedy hinges on a huge joke, played by a\nheartless nephew on his misanthropic uncle, who is induced to take\nto himself a wife, young, fair, and warranted silent, but who, in\nthe end, turns out neither silent nor a woman at all.  In \"The\nAlchemist,\" again, we have the utmost cleverness in construction,\nthe whole fabric building climax on climax, witty, ingenious, and\nso plausibly presented that we forget its departures from the\npossibilities of life.  In \"The Alchemist\" Jonson represented, none\nthe less to the life, certain sharpers of the metropolis, revelling\nin their shrewdness and rascality and in the variety of the\nstupidity and wickedness of their victims.  We may object to the\nfact that the only person in the play possessed of a scruple of\nhonesty is discomfited, and that the greatest scoundrel of all is\napproved in the end and rewarded.  The comedy is so admirably\nwritten and contrived, the personages stand out with such lifelike\ndistinctness in their several kinds, and the whole is animated with\nsuch verve and resourcefulness that \"The Alchemist\" is a new marvel\nevery time it is read.  Lastly of this group comes the tremendous\ncomedy, \"Bartholomew Fair,\" less clear cut, less definite, and less\nstructurally worthy of praise than its three predecessors, but full\nof the keenest and cleverest of satire and inventive to a degree\nbeyond any English comedy save some other of Jonson's own.  It is\nin \"Bartholomew Fair\" that we are presented to the immortal\ncaricature of the Puritan, Zeal-in-the-Land Busy, and the\nLittlewits that group about him, and it is in this extraordinary\ncomedy that the humour of Jonson, always open to this danger,\nloosens into the Rabelaisian mode that so delighted King James in\n\"The Gipsies Metamorphosed.\"  Another comedy of less merit is \"The\nDevil is an Ass,\" acted in 1616.  It was the failure of this play\nthat caused Jonson to give over writing for the public stage for a\nperiod of nearly ten years.\n\n\"Volpone\" was laid as to scene in Venice.  Whether because of the\nsuccess of \"Eastward Hoe\" or for other reasons, the other three\ncomedies declare in the words of the prologue to \"The Alchemist\":\n\n\"Our scene is London, 'cause we would make known\nNo country's mirth is better than our own.\"\n\nIndeed Jonson went further when he came to revise his plays for\ncollected publication in his folio of 1616, he transferred the\nscene of \"Every Man in His Humour\" from Florence to London also,\nconverting Signior Lorenzo di Pazzi to Old Kno'well, Prospero to\nMaster Welborn, and Hesperida to Dame Kitely \"dwelling i' the Old\nJewry.\"\n\nIn his comedies of London life, despite his trend towards\ncaricature, Jonson has shown himself a genuine realist, drawing\nfrom the life about him with an experience and insight rare in any\ngeneration.  A happy comparison has been suggested between Ben\nJonson and Charles Dickens.  Both were men of the people, lowly\nborn and hardly bred.  Each knew the London of his time as few men\nknew it; and each represented it intimately and in elaborate\ndetail.  Both men were at heart moralists, seeking the truth by the\nexaggerated methods of humour and caricature; perverse, even\nwrong-headed at times, but possessed of a true pathos and largeness\nof heart, and when all has been said -- though the Elizabethan ran\nto satire, the Victorian to sentimentality -- leaving the world\nbetter for the art that they practised in it.\n\nIn 1616, the year of the death of Shakespeare, Jonson collected his\nplays, his poetry, and his masques for publication in a collective\nedition.  This was an unusual thing at the time and had been\nattempted by no dramatist before Jonson.  This volume published, in\na carefully revised text, all the plays thus far mentioned,\nexcepting \"The Case is Altered,\" which Jonson did not acknowledge,\n\"Bartholomew Fair,\" and \"The Devil is an Ass,\" which was written\ntoo late.  It included likewise a book of some hundred and thirty\nodd \"Epigrams,\" in which form of brief and pungent writing Jonson\nwas an acknowledged master; \"The Forest,\" a smaller collection of\nlyric and occasional verse and some ten \"Masques\" and\n\"Entertainments.\"  In this same year Jonson was made poet laureate\nwith a pension of one hundred marks a year.  This, with his fees\nand returns from several noblemen, and the small earnings of his\nplays must have formed the bulk of his income.  The poet appears to\nhave done certain literary hack-work for others, as, for example,\nparts of the Punic Wars contributed to Raleigh's \"History of the\nWorld.\"  We know from a story, little to the credit of either, that\nJonson accompanied Raleigh's son abroad in the capacity of a tutor.\nIn 1618 Jonson was granted the reversion of the office of Master of\nthe Revels, a post for which he was peculiarly fitted; but he did\nnot live to enjoy its perquisites.  Jonson was honoured with\ndegrees by both universities, though when and under what\ncircumstances is not known.  It has been said that he narrowly\nescaped the honour of knighthood, which the satirists of the day\naverred King James was wont to lavish with an indiscriminate hand.\nWorse men were made knights in his day than worthy Ben Jonson.\n\nFrom 1616 to the close of the reign of King James, Jonson produced\nnothing for the stage.  But he \"prosecuted\" what he calls \"his\nwonted studies\" with such assiduity that he became in reality, as\nby report, one of the most learned men of his time.  Jonson's\ntheory of authorship involved a wide acquaintance with books and\n\"an ability,\" as he put it, \"to convert the substance or riches of\nanother poet to his own use.\"  Accordingly Jonson read not only the\nGreek and Latin classics down to the lesser writers, but he\nacquainted himself especially with the Latin writings of his\nlearned contemporaries, their prose as well as their poetry, their\nantiquities and curious lore as well as their more solid learning.\nThough a poor man, Jonson was an indefatigable collector of books.\nHe told Drummond that \"the Earl of Pembroke sent him 20 pounds every\nfirst day of the new year to buy new books.\"  Unhappily, in 1623,\nhis library was destroyed by fire, an accident serio-comically\ndescribed in his witty poem, \"An Execration upon Vulcan.\"  Yet even\nnow a book turns up from time to time in which is inscribed, in\nfair large Italian lettering, the name, Ben Jonson.  With respect\nto Jonson's use of his material, Dryden said memorably of him:\n\"[He] was not only a professed imitator of Horace, but a learned\nplagiary of all the others; you track him everywhere in their\nsnow....But he has done his robberies so openly that one sees he\nfears not to be taxed by any law.  He invades authors like a\nmonarch, and what would be theft in other poets is only victory in\nhim.\"  And yet it is but fair to say that Jonson prided himself,\nand justly, on his originality.  In \"Catiline,\" he not only uses\nSallust's account of the conspiracy, but he models some of the\nspeeches of Cicero on the Roman orator's actual words.  In\n\"Poetaster,\" he lifts a whole satire out of Horace and dramatises\nit effectively for his purposes.  The sophist Libanius suggests the\nsituation of \"The Silent Woman\"; a Latin comedy of Giordano Bruno,\n\"Il Candelaio,\" the relation of the dupes and the sharpers in \"The\nAlchemist,\" the \"Mostellaria\" of Plautus, its admirable opening\nscene.  But Jonson commonly bettered his sources, and putting the\nstamp of his sovereignty on whatever bullion he borrowed made it\nthenceforward to all time current and his own.\n\nThe lyric and especially the occasional poetry of Jonson has a\npeculiar merit.  His theory demanded design and the perfection of\nliterary finish. He was furthest from the rhapsodist and the\ncareless singer of an idle day; and he believed that Apollo could\nonly be worthily served in singing robes and laurel crowned.  And\nyet many of Jonson's lyrics will live as long as the language.  Who\ndoes not know \"Queen and huntress, chaste and fair.\"  \"Drink to me\nonly with thine eyes,\" or \"Still to be neat, still to be dressed\"?\nBeautiful in form, deft and graceful in expression, with not a word\ntoo much or one that bears not its part in the total effect, there\nis yet about the lyrics of Jonson a certain stiffness and\nformality, a suspicion that they were not quite spontaneous and\nunbidden, but that they were carved, so to speak, with\ndisproportionate labour by a potent man of letters whose habitual\nthought is on greater things.  It is for these reasons that Jonson\nis even better in the epigram and in occasional verse where\nrhetorical finish and pointed wit less interfere with the\nspontaneity and emotion which we usually associate with lyrical\npoetry.  There are no such epitaphs as Ben Jonson's, witness the\ncharming ones on his own children, on Salathiel Pavy, the\nchild-actor, and many more; and this even though the rigid law of\nmine and thine must now restore to William Browne of Tavistock the\nfamous lines beginning: \"Underneath this sable hearse.\"  Jonson is\nunsurpassed, too, in the difficult poetry of compliment, seldom\nfalling into fulsome praise and disproportionate similitude, yet\nshowing again and again a generous appreciation of worth in others,\na discriminating taste and a generous personal regard.  There was\nno man in England of his rank so well known and universally beloved\nas Ben Jonson.  The list of his friends, of those to whom he had\nwritten verses, and those who had written verses to him, includes\nthe name of every man of prominence in the England of King James.\nAnd the tone of many of these productions discloses an affectionate\nfamiliarity that speaks for the amiable personality and sound worth\nof the laureate.  In 1619, growing unwieldy through inactivity,\nJonson hit upon the heroic remedy of a journey afoot to Scotland.\nOn his way thither and back he was hospitably received at the\nhouses of many friends and by those to whom his friends had\nrecommended him.  When he arrived in Edinburgh, the burgesses met\nto grant him the freedom of the city, and Drummond, foremost of\nScottish poets, was proud to entertain him for weeks as his guest\nat Hawthornden.  Some of the noblest of Jonson's poems were\ninspired by friendship.  Such is the fine \"Ode to the memory of Sir\nLucius Cary and Sir Henry Moryson,\" and that admirable piece of\ncritical insight and filial affection, prefixed to the first\nShakespeare folio, \"To the memory of my beloved master, William\nShakespeare, and what he hath left us,\" to mention only these.  Nor\ncan the earlier \"Epode,\" beginning \"Not to know vice at all,\" be\nmatched in stately gravity and gnomic wisdom in its own wise and\nstately age.\n\nBut if Jonson had deserted the stage after the publication of his\nfolio and up to the end of the reign of King James, he was far from\ninactive; for year after year his inexhaustible inventiveness\ncontinued to contribute to the masquing and entertainment at court.\nIn \"The Golden Age Restored,\" Pallas turns the Iron Age with\nits attendant evils into statues which sink out of sight; in\n\"Pleasure Reconciled to Virtue,\" Atlas figures represented as an\nold man, his shoulders covered with snow, and Comus, \"the god of\ncheer or the belly,\" is one of the characters, a circumstance which\nan imaginative boy of ten, named John Milton, was not to forget.\n\"Pan's Anniversary,\" late in the reign of James, proclaimed that\nJonson had not yet forgotten how to write exquisite lyrics, and\n\"The Gipsies Metamorphosed\" displayed the old drollery and broad\nhumorous stroke still unimpaired and unmatchable.  These, too, and\nthe earlier years of Charles were the days of the Apollo Room of\nthe Devil Tavern where Jonson presided, the absolute monarch of\nEnglish literary Bohemia.  We hear of a room blazoned about with\nJonson's own judicious \"Leges Convivales\" in letters of gold, of a\ncompany made up of the choicest spirits of the time, devotedly\nattached to their veteran dictator, his reminiscences, opinions,\naffections, and enmities.  And we hear, too, of valorous potations;\nbut in the words of Herrick addressed to his master, Jonson, at the\nDevil Tavern, as at the Dog, the Triple Tun, and at the Mermaid,\n\n     \"We such clusters had\n     As made us nobly wild, not mad,\n     And yet each verse of thine\n     Outdid the meat, outdid the frolic wine.\"\n\nBut the patronage of the court failed in the days of King Charles,\nthough Jonson was not without royal favours; and the old poet\nreturned to the stage, producing, between 1625 and 1633, \"The\nStaple of News,\" \"The New Inn,\" \"The Magnetic Lady,\" and \"The Tale\nof a Tub,\" the last doubtless revised from a much earlier comedy.\nNone of these plays met with any marked success, although the\nscathing generalisation of Dryden that designated them \"Jonson's\ndotages\" is unfair to their genuine merits.  Thus the idea of an\noffice for the gathering, proper dressing, and promulgation of news\n(wild flight of the fancy in its time) was an excellent subject for\nsatire on the existing absurdities among newsmongers; although\nas much can hardly be said for \"The Magnetic Lady,\" who, in her\nbounty, draws to her personages of differing humours to reconcile\nthem in the end according to the alternative title, or \"Humours\nReconciled.\"  These last plays of the old dramatist revert to\ncaricature and the hard lines of allegory; the moralist is more\nthan ever present, the satire degenerates into personal lampoon,\nespecially of his sometime friend, Inigo Jones, who appears\nunworthily to have used his influence at court against the\nbroken-down old poet.  And now disease claimed Jonson, and he was\nbedridden for months.  He had succeeded Middleton in 1628 as\nChronologer to the City of London, but lost the post for not\nfulfilling its duties.  King Charles befriended him, and even\ncommissioned him to write still for the entertainment of the court;\nand he was not without the sustaining hand of noble patrons and\ndevoted friends among the younger poets who were proud to be\n\"sealed of the tribe of Ben.\"\n\nJonson died, August 6, 1637, and a second folio of his works, which\nhe had been some time gathering, was printed in 1640, bearing in\nits various parts dates ranging from 1630 to 1642.  It included all\nthe plays mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs, excepting \"The\nCase is Altered;\" the masques, some fifteen, that date between 1617\nand 1630; another collection of lyrics and occasional poetry called\n\"Underwoods\", including some further entertainments; a translation\nof \"Horace's Art of Poetry\" (also published in a vicesimo quarto in\n1640), and certain fragments and ingatherings which the poet would\nhardly have included himself.  These last comprise the fragment\n(less than seventy lines) of a tragedy called \"Mortimer his Fall,\"\nand three acts of a pastoral drama of much beauty and poetic\nspirit, \"The Sad Shepherd.\"  There is also the exceedingly\ninteresting \"English Grammar\" \"made by Ben Jonson for the benefit\nof all strangers out of his observation of the English language now\nspoken and in use,\" in Latin and English; and \"Timber, or\nDiscoveries\" \"made upon men and matter as they have flowed out of\nhis daily reading, or had their reflux to his peculiar notion of\nthe times.\"  The \"Discoveries,\" as it is usually called, is a\ncommonplace book such as many literary men have kept, in which\ntheir reading was chronicled, passages that took their fancy\ntranslated or transcribed, and their passing opinions noted.  Many\npassages of Jonson's \"Discoveries\" are literal translations from the\nauthors he chanced to be reading, with the reference, noted or not,\nas the accident of the moment prescribed.  At times he follows the\nline of Macchiavelli's argument as to the nature and conduct of\nprinces; at others he clarifies his own conception of poetry and\npoets by recourse to Aristotle.  He finds a choice paragraph on\neloquence in Seneca the elder and applies it to his own\nrecollection of Bacon's power as an orator; and another on facile\nand ready genius, and translates it, adapting it to his\nrecollection of his fellow-playwright, Shakespeare.  To call such\npassages -- which Jonson never intended for publication --\nplagiarism, is to obscure the significance of words.  To disparage\nhis memory by citing them is a preposterous use of scholarship.\nJonson's prose, both in his dramas, in the descriptive comments of\nhis masques, and in the \"Discoveries,\" is characterised by clarity\nand vigorous directness, nor is it wanting in a fine sense of form\nor in the subtler graces of diction.\n\nWhen Jonson died there was a project for a handsome monument to his\nmemory. But the Civil War was at hand, and the project failed.  A\nmemorial, not insufficient, was carved on the stone covering his\ngrave in one of the aisles of Westminster Abbey:\n\n\"O rare Ben Jonson.\"\n\nFELIX E.

And, when you shall consider, through the\ncertain hatred of some, how much a man's innocency may be endangered by\nan uncertain accusation; you will, I doubt not, so begin to hate the\niniquity of such natures, as I shall love the contumely done me, whose\nend was so honourable as to be wiped off by your sentence.\n\nYour unprofitable, but true Lover,\n\nBEN JONSON.\n\n\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE:\n\nMOROSE, a Gentleman that loves no noise.\n\nSIR DAUPHINE EUGENIE, a Knight, his Nephew.\n\nNED CLERIMONT, a Gentleman, his Friend.\n\nTRUEWIT, another Friend.\n\nSIR JOHN DAW, a Knight.\n\nSIR AMOROUS LA-FOOLE, a Knight also.\n\nTHOMAS OTTER, a Land and Sea Captain.\n\nCUTBEARD, a Barber.\n\nMUTE, one of MOROSE's Servants.\n\nPARSON.\n\nPage to CLERIMONT.\n\nEPICOENE, supposed the Silent Woman.\n\nLADY HAUGHTY, LADY CENTAURE, MISTRESS DOL MAVIS,\nLadies Collegiates.\n\nMISTRESS OTTER, the Captain's Wife, MISTRESS TRUSTY,\nLADY HAUGHTY'S Woman, Pretenders.\n\nPages, Servants, etc.\n\n\nSCENE -- LONDON.\n\n\n\n\nPROLOGUE\n\n   Truth says, of old the art of making plays\n   Was to content the people; and their praise\n   Was to the poet money, wine, and bays.\n\n   But in this age, a sect of writers are,\n   That, only, for particular likings care,\n   And will taste nothing that is popular.\n\n   With such we mingle neither brains nor breasts;\n   Our wishes, like to those make public feasts,\n   Are not to please the cook's taste, but the guests'.\n\n   Yet, if those cunning palates hither come,\n   They shall find guests' entreaty, and good room;\n   And though all relish not, sure there will be some,\n\n   That, when they leave their seats, shall make them say,\n   Who wrote that piece, could so have wrote a play,\n   But that he knew this was the better way.\n\n   For, to present all custard, or all tart,\n   And have no other meats, to bear a part.\n   Or to want bread, and salt, were but course art.\n\n   The poet prays you then, with better thought\n   To sit; and, when his cates are all in brought,\n   Though there be none far-fet, there will dear-bought,\n\n   Be fit for ladies: some for lords, knights, 'squires;\n   Some for your waiting-wench, and city-wires;\n   Some for your men, and daughters of Whitefriars.\n\n   Nor is it, only, while you keep your seat\n   Here, that his feast will last; but you shall eat\n   A week at ord'naries, on his broken meat:\n     If his muse be true,\n     Who commends her to you.\n\n\n\n\nANOTHER.\n\n   The ends of all, who for the scene do write,\n   Are, or should be, to profit and delight.\n   And still't hath been the praise of all best times,\n   So persons were not touch'd, to tax the crimes.\n   Then, in this play, which we present to-night,\n   And make the object of your ear and sight,\n   On forfeit of yourselves, think nothing true:\n   Lest so you make the maker to judge you,\n   For he knows, poet never credit gain'd\n   By writing truths, but things (like truths) well feign'd.\n   If any yet will, with particular sleight\n   Of application, wrest what he doth write;\n   And that he meant, or him, or her, will say:\n   They make a libel, which he made a play.\n\n\n\n\nACT 1.\n\n   SCENE 1.1.\n\n   A ROOM IN CLERIMONT'S HOUSE.\n\n   ENTER CLERIMONT, MAKING HIMSELF READY, FOLLOWED BY HIS PAGE.\n\n   CLER: Have you got the song yet perfect, I gave you, boy?\n\n   PAGE: Yes, sir.\n\n   CLER: Let me hear it.\n\n   PAGE: You shall, sir, but i'faith let nobody else.\n\n   CLER: Why, I pray?\n\n   PAGE: It will get you the dangerous name of a poet in town, sir;\n   besides me a perfect deal of ill-will at the mansion you wot of,\n   whose lady is the argument of it; where now I am the welcomest\n   thing under a man that comes there.\n\n   CLER: I think, and above a man too, if the truth were rack'd out\n   of you.\n\n   PAGE: No, faith, I'll confess before, sir. The gentlewomen play with\n   me, and throw me on the bed; and carry me in to my lady; and she\n   kisses me with her oil'd face; and puts a peruke on my head; and\n   asks me an I will wear her gown? and I say, no: and then she\n   hits me a blow o' the ear, and calls me Innocent! and lets me go.\n\n   CLER: No marvel if the door be kept shut against your master, when\n   the entrance is so easy to you--well sir, you shall go there no\n   more, lest I be fain to seek your voice in my lady's rushes, a\n   fortnight hence. Sing, sir.\n\n   PAGE [SINGS]: Still to be neat, still to be drest--\n\n   [ENTER TRUEWIT.]\n\n   TRUE: Why, here's the man that can melt away his time and never\n   feels it! What between his mistress abroad, and his ingle at\n   home, high fare, soft lodging, fine clothes, and his fiddle; he\n   thinks the hours have no wings, or the day no post-horse. Well,\n   sir gallant, were you struck with the plague this minute, or\n   condemn'd to any capital punishment to-morrow, you would begin\n   then to think, and value every article of your time, esteem it\n   at the true rate, and give all for it.\n\n   CLER: Why what should a man do?\n\n   TRUE: Why, nothing; or that which, when it is done, is as idle.\n   Harken after the next horse-race or hunting-match; lay wagers,\n   praise Puppy, or Pepper-corn, White-foot, Franklin; swear upon\n   Whitemane's party; speak aloud, that my lords may hear you;\n   visit my ladies at night, and be able to give them the character\n   of every bowler or better on the green. These be the things\n   wherein your fashionable men exercise themselves, and I for\n   company.\n\n   CLER: Nay, if I have thy authority, I'll not leave yet. Come,\n   the other are considerations, when we come to have gray heads\n   and weak hams, moist eyes and shrunk members. We'll think on\n   'em then; and we'll pray and fast.\n\n   TRUE: Ay, and destine only that time of age to goodness, which our\n   want of ability will not let us employ in evil!\n\n   CLER: Why, then 'tis time enough.\n\n   TRUE: Yes; as if a man should sleep all the term, and think to\n   effect his business the last day. O, Clerimont, this time, because\n   it is an incorporeal thing, and not subject to sense, we mock\n   ourselves the fineliest out of it, with vanity and misery\n   indeed! not seeking an end of wretchedness, but only changing the\n   matter still.\n\n   CLER: Nay, thou wilt not leave now--\n\n   TRUE: See but our common disease! with what justice can we complain,\n   that great men will not look upon us, nor be at leisure to give\n   our affairs such dispatch as we expect, when we will never do it\n   to ourselves? nor hear, nor regard ourselves?\n\n   CLER: Foh! thou hast read Plutarch's morals, now, or some such\n   tedious fellow; and it shews so vilely with thee! 'fore God, 'twill\n   spoil thy wit utterly. Talk me of pins, and feathers, and\n   ladies, and rushes, and such things: and leave this Stoicity\n   alone, till thou mak'st sermons.\n\n   TRUE: Well, sir; if it will not take, I have learn'd to lose as\n   little of my kindness as I can. I'll do good to no man against his\n   will, certainly. When were you at the college?\n\n   CLER: What college?\n\n   TRUE: As if you knew not!\n\n   CLER: No faith, I came but from court yesterday.\n\n   TRUE: Why, is it not arrived there yet, the news? A new foundation,\n   sir, here in the town, of ladies, that call themselves the\n   collegiates, an order between courtiers and country-madams,\n   that live from their husbands; and give entertainment to all the\n   wits, and braveries of the time, as they call them: cry down, or\n   up, what they like or dislike in a brain or a fashion, with most\n   masculine, or rather hermaphroditical authority; and every day\n   gain to their college some new probationer.\n\n   CLER: Who is the president?\n\n   TRUE: The grave, and youthful matron, the lady Haughty.\n\n   CLER: A pox of her autumnal face, her pieced beauty! there's no man\n   can be admitted till she be ready, now-a-days, till she has\n   painted, and perfumed, and wash'd, and scour'd, but the boy here;\n   and him she wipes her oil'd lips upon, like a sponge. I have made\n   a song, I pray thee hear it, on the subject.\n\n   PAGE. [SINGS.]\n\n   Still to be neat, still to be drest,\n   As you were going to a feast;\n   Still to be powder'd, still perfum'd;\n   Lady, it is to be presumed,\n   Though art's hid causes are not found,\n   All is not sweet, all is not sound.\n\n   Give me a look, give me a face,\n   That makes simplicity a grace;\n   Robes loosely flowing, hair as free:\n   Such sweet neglect more taketh me,\n   Then all the adulteries of art;\n   They strike mine eyes, but not my heart.\n\n   TRUE: And I am clearly on the other side: I love a good dressing\n   before any beauty o' the world. O, a woman is then like a\n   delicate garden; nor is there one kind of it; she may vary every\n   hour; take often counsel of her glass, and choose the best. If\n   she have good ears, shew them; good hair, lay it out; good\n   legs, wear short clothes; a good hand, discover it often;\n   practise any art to mend breath, cleanse teeth, repair eye-brows;\n   paint, and profess it.\n\n   CLER: How? publicly?\n\n   TRUE: The doing of it, not the manner: that must be private. Many\n   things that seem foul in the doing, do please done. A lady\n   should, indeed, study her face, when we think she sleeps; nor,\n   when the doors are shut, should men be enquiring; all is sacred\n   within, then. Is it for us to see their perukes put on, their\n   false teeth, their complexion, their eye-brows, their nails? You\n   see guilders will not work, but inclosed. They must not discover\n   how little serves, with the help of art, to adorn a great deal.\n   How long did the canvas hang afore Aldgate? Were the people\n   suffered to see the city's Love and Charity, while they were rude\n   stone, before they were painted and burnish'd? No: no more should\n   Servants approach their mistresses, but when they are complete and\n   finish'd.\n\n   CLER: Well said, my Truewit.\n\n   TRUE: And a wise lady will keep a guard always upon the place, that\n   she may do things securely. I once followed a rude fellow into a\n   chamber, where the poor madam, for haste, and troubled, snatch'd\n   at her peruke to cover her baldness; and put it on the wrong way.\n\n   CLER: O prodigy!\n\n   TRUE: And the unconscionable knave held her in complement an hour\n   with that reverst face, when I still look'd when she should talk\n   from the t'other side.\n\n   CLER: Why, thou shouldst have relieved her.\n\n   TRUE: No, faith, I let her alone, as we'll let this argument, if you\n   please, and pass to another. When saw you Dauphine Eugenie?\n\n   CLER: Not these three days. Shall we go to him this morning? he is\n   very melancholy, I hear.\n\n   TRUE: Sick of the uncle? is he? I met that stiff piece of\n   formality, his uncle, yesterday, with a huge turban of night-caps\n   on his head, buckled over his ears.\n\n   CLER: O, that's his custom when he walks abroad. He can endure no\n   noise, man.\n\n   TRUE: So I have heard. But is the disease so ridiculous in him as it\n   is made? They say he has been upon divers treaties with the\n   fish-wives and orange-women; and articles propounded between\n   them: marry, the chimney-sweepers will not be drawn in.\n\n   CLER: No, nor the broom-men: they stand out stiffly. He cannot\n   endure a costard-monger, he swoons if he hear one.\n\n   TRUE: Methinks a smith should be ominous.\n\n   CLER: Or any hammer-man. A brasier is not suffer'd to dwell in the\n   parish, nor an armourer. He would have hang'd a pewterer's prentice\n   once on a Shrove-tuesday's riot, for being of that trade, when the\n   rest were quit.\n\n   TRUE: A trumpet should fright him terribly, or the hautboys.\n\n   CLER: Out of his senses. The waights of the city have a pension of\n   him not to come near that ward. This youth practised on him one\n   night like the bell-man; and never left till he had brought him\n   down to the door with a long-sword: and there left him\n   flourishing with the air.\n\n   PAGE: Why, sir, he hath chosen a street to lie in so narrow at both\n   ends, that it will receive no coaches, nor carts, nor any of these\n   common noises: and therefore we that love him, devise to bring him\n   in such as we may, now and then, for his exercise, to breathe him.\n   He would grow resty else in his ease: his virtue would rust without\n   action. I entreated a bearward, one day, to come down with the\n   dogs of some four parishes that way, and I thank him he did;\n   and cried his games under master Morose's window: till he was\n   sent crying away, with his head made a most bleeding spectacle to\n   the multitude. And, another time, a fencer marchng to his prize, had\n   his drum most tragically run through, for taking that street in his\n   way at my request.\n\n   TRUE: A good wag! How does he for the bells?\n\n   CLER: O, in the Queen's time, he was wont to go out of town every\n   Saturday at ten o'clock, or on holy day eves. But now, by reason of\n   the sickness, the perpetuity of ringing has made him devise a\n   room, with double walls, and treble ceilings; the windows close\n   shut and caulk'd: and there he lives by candlelight. He turn'd away\n   a man, last week, for having a pair of new shoes that creak'd.\n   And this fellow waits on him now in tennis-court socks, or slippers\n   soled with wool: and they talk each to other in a trunk. See, who\n   comes here!\n\n   [ENTER SIR DAUPHINE EUGENIE.]\n\n   DAUP: How now! what ail you sirs? dumb?\n\n   TRUE: Struck into stone, almost, I am here, with tales o' thine\n   uncle. There was never such a prodigy heard of.\n\n   DAUP: I would you would once lose this subject, my masters, for my\n   sake. They are such as you are, that have brought me into that\n   predicament I am with him.\n\n   TRUE: How is that?\n\n   DAUP: Marry, that he will disinherit me; no more. He thinks, I and\n   my company are authors of all the ridiculous Acts and Monuments are\n   told of him.\n\n   TRUE: S'lid, I would be the author of more to vex him; that purpose\n   deserves it: it gives thee law of plaguing him. I will tell thee\n   what I would do. I would make a false almanack; get it printed:\n   and then have him drawn out on a coronation day to the Tower-wharf,\n   and kill him with the noise of the ordnance. Disinherit thee! he\n   cannot, man. Art not thou next of blood, and his sister's son?\n\n   DAUP: Ay, but he will thrust me out of it, he vows, and marry.\n\n   TRUE: How! that's a more portent. Can he endure no noise, and will\n   venture on a wife?\n\n   CLER: Yes: why thou art a stranger, it seems, to his best trick,\n   yet. He has employed a fellow this half year all over England to\n   hearken him out a dumb woman; be she of any form, or any\n   quality, so she be able to bear children: her silence is dowry\n   enough, he says.\n\n   TRUE: But I trust to God he has found none.\n\n   CLER: No; but he has heard of one that is lodged in the next street\n   to him, who is exceedingly soft-spoken; thrifty of her speech; that\n   spends but six words a day. And her he's about now, and shall have\n   her.\n\n   TRUE: Is't possible! who is his agent in the business?\n\n   CLER: Marry a barber; one Cutbeard; an honest fellow, one that\n   tells Dauphine all here.\n\n   TRUE: Why you oppress me with wonder: a woman, and a barber, and\n   love no noise!\n\n   CLER: Yes, faith. The fellow trims him silently, and has not the\n   knack with his sheers or his fingers: and that continence in a\n   barber he thinks so eminent a virtue, as it has made him chief of\n   his counsel.\n\n   TRUE: Is the barber to be seen, or the wench?\n\n   CLER: Yes, that they are.\n\n   TRUE: I prithee, Dauphine, let us go thither.\n\n   DAUP: I have some business now: I cannot, i'faith.\n\n   TRUE: You shall have no business shall make you neglect this, sir;\n   we'll make her talk, believe it; or, if she will not, we can give\n   out at least so much as shall interrupt the treaty; we will break\n   it. Thou art bound in conscience, when he suspects thee without\n   cause, to torment him.\n\n   DAUP: Not I, by any means. I will give no suffrage to't. He shall\n   never have that plea against me, that I opposed the least phant'sy\n   of his. Let it lie upon my stars to be guilty, I'll be innocent.\n\n   TRUE: Yes, and be poor, and beg; do, innocent: when some groom of\n   his has got him an heir, or this barber, if he himself cannot.\n   Innocent!--I prithee, Ned, where lies she? let him be innocent\n   still.\n\n   CLER: Why, right over against the barber's; in the house where\n   sir John Daw lies.\n\n   TRUE: You do not mean to confound me!\n\n   CLER: Why?\n\n   TRUE: Does he that would marry her know so much?\n\n   CLER: I cannot tell.\n\n   TRUE: 'Twere enough of imputation to her with him.\n\n   CLER: Why?\n\n   TRUE: The only talking sir in the town! Jack Daw!\n   and he teach her not to speak!--God be wi' you.\n*    I have some business too.\n\n   CLER: Will you not go thither, then?\n\n   TRUE: Not with the danger to meet Daw, for mine ears.\n\n   CLER: Why? I thought you two had been upon very good terms.\n\n   TRUE: Yes, of keeping distance.\n\n   CLER: They say, he is a very good scholar.\n\n   TRUE: Ay, and he says it first. A pox on him, a fellow that\n   pretends only to learning, buys titles, and nothing else of\n   books in him!\n\n   CLER: The world reports him to be very learned.\n\n   TRUE: I am sorry the world should so conspire to belie him.\n\n   CLER: Good faith, I have heard very good things come from him.\n\n   TRUE: You may; there's none so desperately ignorant to deny that:\n   would they were his own! God be wi' you, gentleman.\n\n   [EXIT HASTILY.]\n\n   CLER: This is very abrupt!\n\n   DAUP: Come, you are a strange open man, to tell every thing thus.\n\n   CLER: Why, believe it, Dauphine, Truewit's a very honest fellow.\n\n   DAUP: I think no other: but this frank nature of his is not for\n   secrets.\n\n   CLER: Nay, then, you are mistaken, Dauphine: I know where he has been\n   well trusted, and discharged the trust very truly, and heartily.\n\n   DAUP: I contend not, Ned; but with the fewer a business is carried,\n   it is ever the safer. Now we are alone, if you will go thither, I\n   am for you.\n\n   CLER: When were you there?\n\n   DAUP: Last night: and such a Decameron of sport fallen out! Boccace\n   never thought of the like. Daw does nothing but court her; and the\n   wrong way. He would lie with her, and praises her modesty; desires\n   that she would talk and be free, and commends her silence in\n   verses: which he reads, and swears are the best that ever man\n   made. Then rails at his fortunes, stamps, and mutines, why he is\n   not made a counsellor, and call'd to affairs of state.\n\n   CLER: I prithee let's go. I would fain partake this. Some water,\n   boy.\n\n   [EXIT PAGE.]\n\n   DAUP: We are invited to dinner together, he and I, by one that came\n   thither to him, sir La-Foole.\n\n   CLER: O, that's a precious mannikin.\n\n   DAUP: Do you know him?\n\n   CLER: Ay, and he will know you too, if e'er he saw you but once,\n   though you should meet him at church in the midst of prayers. He is\n   one of the braveries, though he be none of the wits. He will salute\n   a judge upon the bench, and a bishop in the pulpit, a lawyer when\n   he is pleading at the bar, and a lady when she is dancing in a\n   masque, and put her out. He does give plays, and suppers, and\n   invites his guests to them, aloud, out of his window, as they\n   ride by in coaches. He has a lodging in the Strand for the purpose:\n   or to watch when ladies are gone to the china-houses, or the\n   Exchange, that he may meet them by chance, and give them presents,\n   some two or three hundred pounds' worth of toys, to be laugh'd at.\n   He is never without a spare banquet, or sweet-meats in his chamber,\n   for their women to alight at, and come up to for a bait.\n\n   DAUP: Excellent! he was a fine youth last night; but now he is much\n   finer! what is his Christian name? I have forgot.\n\n   [RE-ENTER PAGE.]\n\n   CLER: Sir Amorous La-Foole.\n\n   PAGE: The gentleman is here below that owns that name.\n\n   CLER: 'Heart, he's come to invite me to dinner, I hold my life.\n\n   DAUP: Like enough: prithee, let's have him up.\n\n   CLER: Boy, marshal him.\n\n   PAGE: With a truncheon, sir?\n\n   CLER: Away, I beseech you.\n   [EXIT PAGE.]\n   I'll make him tell us his pedegree, now; and what meat he has to\n   dinner; and who are his guests; and the whole course of his\n   fortunes: with a breath.\n\n   [ENTER SIR AMOROUS LA-FOOLE.]\n\n   LA-F: 'Save, dear sir Dauphine! honoured master Clerimont!\n\n   CLER: Sir Amorous! you have very much honested my lodging with your\n   presence.\n\n   LA-F: Good faith, it is a fine lodging: almost as delicate a lodging\n   as mine.\n\n   CLER: Not so, sir.\n\n   LA-F: Excuse me, sir, if it were in the Strand, I assure you. I am\n   come, master Clerimont, to entreat you to wait upon two or three\n   ladies, to dinner, to-day.\n\n   CLER: How, sir! wait upon them? did you ever see me carry dishes?\n\n   LA-F: No, sir, dispense with me; I meant, to bear them company.\n\n   CLER: O, that I will, sir: the doubtfulness of your phrase, believe\n   it, sir, would breed you a quarrel once an hour, with the terrible\n   boys, if you should but keep them fellowship a day.\n\n   LA-F: It should be extremely against my will, sir, if I contested\n   with any man.\n\n   CLER: I believe it, sir; where hold you your feast?\n\n   LA-F: At Tom Otter's, sir.\n\n   PAGE: Tom Otter? what's he?\n\n   LA-F: Captain Otter, sir; he is a kind of gamester, but he has had\n   command both by sea and by land.\n\n   PAGE: O, then he is animal amphibium?\n\n   LA-F: Ay, sir: his wife was the rich china-woman, that the courtiers\n   visited so often; that gave the rare entertainment. She commands\n   all at home.\n\n   CLER: Then she is captain Otter.\n\n   LA-F: You say very well, sir: she is my kinswoman, a La-Foole by the\n   mother-side, and will invite any great ladies for my sake.\n\n   PAGE: Not of the La-Fooles of Essex?\n\n   LA-F: No, sir, the La-Fooles of London.\n\n   CLER: Now, he's in. [ASIDE.]\n\n   LA-F: They all come out of our house, the La-Fooles of the north, the\n   La-Fooles of the west, the La-Fooles of the east and south--we are\n   as ancient a family as any is in Europe--but I myself am descended\n   lineally of the French La-Fooles--and, we do bear for our coat\n   yellow, or or, checker'd azure, and gules, and some three or four\n   colours more, which is a very noted coat, and has, sometimes, been\n   solemnly worn by divers nobility of our house--but let that go,\n   antiquity is not respected now.--I had a brace of fat does sent me,\n   gentlemen, and half a dozen of pheasants, a dozen or two of\n   godwits, and some other fowl, which I would have eaten, while they\n   are good, and in good company:--there will be a great lady, or two,\n   my lady Haughty, my lady Centaure, mistress Dol Mavis--and they come\n   o' purpose to see the silent gentlewoman, mistress Epicoene, that\n   honest sir John Daw has promis'd to bring thither--and then, mistress\n   Trusty, my lady's woman, will be there too, and this honourable\n   knight, sir Dauphine, with yourself, master Clerimont--and we'll\n   be very merry, and have fidlers, and dance.--I have been a mad wag\n   in my time, and have spent some crowns since I was a page in\n   court, to my lord Lofty, and after, my lady's gentleman-usher, who\n   got me knighted in Ireland, since it pleased my elder brother to\n   die.--I had as fair a gold jerkin on that day, as any worn in\n   the island voyage, or at Cadiz, none dispraised; and I came over in\n   it hither, shew'd myself to my friends in court, and after went\n   down to my tenants in the country, and surveyed my lands, let\n   new leases, took their money, spent it in the eye o' the land\n   here, upon ladies:--and now I can take up at my pleasure.\n\n   DAUP: Can you take up ladies, sir?\n\n   CLER: O, let him breathe, he has not recover'd.\n\n   DAUP: Would I were your half in that commodity!\n\n   LA-F.: No, sir, excuse me: I meant money, which can take up any\n   thing.

Come, 'tis time we prevented it.\n\n   CLER: Go.\n\n   [EXEUNT.]\n\n\n\n\nACT 2.\n\n\n   SCENE 2.1.\n\n   A ROOM IN MOROSE'S HOUSE.\n\n   ENTER MOROSE, WITH A TUBE IN HIS HAND, FOLLOWED BY MUTE.\n\n   MOR: Cannot I, yet, find out a more compendious method, than by\n   this trunk, to save my servants the labour of speech, and mine\n   ears the discord of sounds? Let me see: all discourses but my\n   own afflict me, they seem harsh, impertinent, and irksome. Is\n   it not possible, that thou should'st answer me by signs, and I\n   apprehend thee, fellow? Speak not, though I question you. You have\n   taken the ring off from the street door, as I bade you? answer me\n   not by speech, but by silence; unless it be otherwise\n   [MUTE MAKES A LEG.]\n   --very good. And you have fastened on a thick quilt, or flock-bed,\n   on the outside of the door; that if they knock with their\n   daggers, or with brick-bats, they can make no noise?--But with\n   your leg, your answer, unless it be otherwise,\n   [MUTE MAKES A LEG.]\n   --Very good. This is not only fit modesty in a servant, but good\n   state and discretion in a master. And you have been with Cutbeard\n   the barber, to have him come to me?\n   [MUTE MAKES A LEG.]\n   --Good. And, he will come presently? Answer me not but with your\n   leg, unless it be otherwise: if it be otherwise, shake your\n   head, or shrug.\n   [MUTE MAKES A LEG.]\n   --So! Your Italian and Spaniard are wise in these: and it is a\n   frugal and comely gravity. How long will it be ere Cutbeard come?\n   Stay, if an hour, hold up your whole hand, if half an hour, two\n   fingers; if a quarter, one;\n   [MUTE HOLDS UP A FINGER BENT.]\n   --Good: half a quarter? 'tis well. And have you given him a key,\n   to come in without knocking?\n   [MUTE MAKES A LEG.]\n   --good. And is the lock oil'd, and the hinges, to-day?\n   [MUTE MAKES A LEG.]\n   --good. And the quilting of the stairs no where worn out, and\n   bare?\n   [MUTE MAKES A LEG.]\n   --Very good. I see, by much doctrine, and impulsion, it may be\n   effected: stand by. The Turk, in this divine discipline, is\n   admirable, exceeding all the potentates of the earth; still waited\n   on by mutes; and all his commands so executed; yea, even in the\n   war, as I have heard, and in his marches, most of his charges\n   and directions given by signs, and with silence: an exquisite\n   art! and I am heartily ashamed, and angry oftentimes, that the\n   princes of Christendom should suffer a barbarian to transcend\n   them in so high a point of felicity. I will practise it hereafter.\n   [A HORN WINDED WITHIN.]\n   --How now? oh! oh! what villain, what prodigy of mankind is that?\n   look.\n   [EXIT MUTE.]\n   --[HORN AGAIN.]\n   --Oh! cut his throat, cut his throat! what murderer, hell-hound,\n   devil can this be?\n\n   [RE-ENTER MUTE.]\n\n   MUTE: It is a post from the court--\n\n   MOR: Out rogue! and must thou blow thy horn too?\n\n   MUTE: Alas, it is a post from the court, sir, that says, he must\n   speak with you, pain of death--\n\n   MOR: Pain of thy life, be silent!\n\n   [ENTER TRUEWIT WITH A POST-HORN, AND A HALTER IN HIS HAND.]\n\n   TRUE: By your leave, sir;--I am a stranger here:--Is your name\n   master Morose? is your name master Morose? Fishes! Pythagoreans\n   all! This is strange. What say you, sir? nothing? Has Harpocrates\n   been here with his club, among you? Well sir, I will believe you\n   to be the man at this time: I will venture upon you, sir. Your\n   friends at court commend them to you, sir--\n\n   MOR: O men! O manners! was there ever such an impudence?\n\n   TRUE: And are extremely solicitous for you, sir.\n\n   MOR: Whose knave are you?\n\n   TRUE: Mine own knave, and your compeer, sir.\n\n   MOR: Fetch me my sword--\n\n   TRUE: You shall taste the one half of my dagger, if you do, groom;\n   and you, the other, if you stir, sir: Be patient, I charge you,\n   in the king's name, and hear me without insurrection. They say, you\n   are to marry; to marry! do you mark, sir?\n\n   MOR: How then, rude companion!\n\n   TRUE: Marry, your friends do wonder, sir, the Thames being so near,\n   wherein you may drown, so handsomely; or London-bridge, at a low\n   fall, with a fine leap, to hurry you down the stream; or, such a\n   delicate steeple, in the town as Bow, to vault from; or, a braver\n   height, as Paul's; Or, if you affected to do it nearer home, and a\n   shorter way, an excellent garret-window into the street; or, a\n   beam in the said garret, with this halter\n   [HE SHEWS HIM A HALTER.]--\n   which they have sent, and desire, that you would sooner commit your\n   grave head to this knot, than to the wedlock noose; or, take a\n   little sublimate, and go out of the world like a rat; or a fly,\n   as one said, with a straw in your arse: any way, rather than to\n   follow this goblin Matrimony. Alas, sir, do you ever think to\n   find a chaste wife in these times? now? when there are so many\n   masques, plays, Puritan preachings, mad folks, and other strange\n   sights to be seen daily, private and public? If you had lived\n   in king Ethelred's time, sir, or Edward the Confessor, you might,\n   perhaps, have found one in some cold country hamlet, then, a dull\n   frosty wench, would have been contented with one man: now, they\n   will as soon be pleased with one leg, or one eye. I'll tell you,\n   sir, the monstrous hazards you shall run with a wife.\n\n   MOR: Good sir, have I ever cozen'd any friends of yours of their\n   land? bought their possessions? taken forfeit of their mortgage?\n   begg'd a reversion from them? bastarded their issue? What have I\n   done, that may deserve this?\n\n   TRUE: Nothing, sir, that I know, but your itch of marriage.\n\n   MOR: Why? if I had made an assassinate upon your father, vitiated\n   your mother, ravished your sisters--\n\n   TRUE: I would kill you, sir, I would kill you, if you had.\n\n   MOR: Why, you do more in this, sir: it were a vengeance centuple,\n   for all facinorous acts that could be named, to do that you do.\n\n   TRUE: Alas, sir, I am but a messenger: I but tell you, what you\n   must hear. It seems your friends are careful after your soul's\n   health, sir, and would have you know the danger: (but you may do\n   your pleasure for all them, I persuade not, sir.) If, after you are\n   married, your wife do run away with a vaulter, or the Frenchman\n   that walks upon ropes, or him that dances the jig, or a fencer\n   for his skill at his weapon; why it is not their fault, they have\n   discharged their consciences; when you know what may happen. Nay,\n   suffer valiantly, sir, for I must tell you all the perils that\n   you are obnoxious to. If she be fair, young and vegetous, no sweet-\n   meats ever drew more flies; all the yellow doublets and great\n   roses in the town will be there. If foul and crooked, she'll be\n   with them, and buy those doublets and roses, sir. If rich, and\n   that you marry her dowry, not her, she'll reign in your house\n   as imperious as a widow. If noble, all her kindred will be your\n   tyrants. If fruitful, as proud as May, and humorous as April; she\n   must have her doctors, her midwives, her nurses, her longings every\n   hour; though it be for the dearest morsel of man. If learned,\n   there was never such a parrot; all your patrimony will be too\n   little for the guests that must be invited to hear her speak\n   Latin and Greek; and you must lie with her in those languages\n   too, if you will please her. If precise, you must feast all the\n   silenced brethren, once in three days; salute the sisters;\n   entertain the whole family, or wood of them; and hear long-winded\n   exercises, singings and catechisings, which you are not given to,\n   and yet must give for: to please the zealous matron your wife, who\n   for the holy cause, will cozen you, over and above. You begin to\n   sweat, sir! but this is not half, i'faith: you may do your\n   pleasure, notwithstanding, as I said before: I come not to persuade\n   you.\n   [MUTE IS STEALING AWAY.]\n   --Upon my faith, master servingman, if you do stir, I will beat\n   you.\n\n   MOR: O, what is my sin! what is my sin!\n\n   TRUE: Then, if you love your wife, or rather dote on her, sir: O, how\n   she'll torture you! and take pleasure in your torments! you shall\n   lie with her but when she lists; she will not hurt her beauty, her\n   complexion; or it must be for that jewel, or that pearl, when she\n   does: every half hour's pleasure must be bought anew: and with the\n   same pain and charge you woo'd her at first. Then you must\n   keep what servants she please; what company she will; that friend\n   must not visit you without her license; and him she loves most, she\n   will seem to hate eagerliest, to decline your jealousy; or, feign\n   to be jealous of you first; and for that cause go live with her\n   she-friend, or cousin at the college, that can instruct her in all\n   the mysteries of writing letters, corrupting servants, taming\n   spies; where she must have that rich gown for such a great day; a\n   new one for the next; a richer for the third; be served in silver;\n   have the chamber fill'd with a succession of grooms, footmen,\n   ushers, and other messengers; besides embroiderers, jewellers,\n   tire-women, sempsters, feathermen, perfumers; whilst she feels not\n   how the land drops away; nor the acres melt; nor foresees the\n   change, when the mercer has your woods for her velvets; never\n   weighs what her pride costs, sir: so she may kiss a page, or a\n   smooth chin, that has the despair of a beard; be a stateswoman,\n   know all the news, what was done at Salisbury, what at the Bath,\n   what at court, what in progress; or, so she may censure poets, and\n   authors, and styles, and compare them, Daniel with Spenser, Jonson\n   with the t'other youth, and so forth: or be thought cunning in\n   controversies, or the very knots of divinity; and have often in\n   her mouth the state of the question: and then skip to the\n   mathematics, and demonstration: and answer in religion to one,\n   in state to another, in bawdry to a third.\n\n   MOR: O, O!\n\n   TRUE: All this is very true, sir. And then her going in disguise to\n   that conjurer, and this cunning woman: where the first question is,\n   how soon you shall die? next, if her present servant love her?\n   next, if she shall have a new servant? and how many? which of her\n   family would make the best bawd, male, or female? what precedence\n   she shall have by her next match? and sets down the answers, and\n   believes them above the scriptures. Nay, perhaps she will study the\n   art.\n\n   MOR: Gentle sir, have you done? have you had your pleasure of me?\n   I'll think of these things.\n\n   TRUE: Yes sir: and then comes reeking home of vapour and sweat,\n   with going a foot, and lies in a month of a new face, all oil and\n   birdlime; and rises in asses' milk, and is cleansed with a new\n   fucus: God be wi' you, sir. One thing more, which I had almost\n   forgot. This too, with whom you are to marry, may have made a\n   conveyance of her virginity afore hand, as your wise widows do of\n   their states, before they marry, in trust to some friend, sir: who\n   can tell? Or if she have not done it yet, she may do, upon the\n   wedding-day, or the night before, and antedate you cuckold. The\n   like has been heard of in nature. 'Tis no devised, impossible\n   thing, sir. God be wi' you: I'll be bold to leave this rope with\n   you, sir, for a remembrance. Farewell, Mute!\n\n   [EXIT.]\n\n   MOR: Come, have me to my chamber: but first shut the door.\n   [TRUEWIT WINDS THE HORN WITHOUT.]\n   O, shut the door, shut the door! is he come again?\n\n   [ENTER CUTBEARD.]\n\n   CUT: 'tis I, sir, your barber.\n\n   MOR: O, Cutbeard, Cutbeard, Cutbeard! here has been a cut-throat\n   with me: help me in to my bed, and give me physic with thy counsel.\n\n   [EXEUNT.]\n\n   SCENE 2.2.\n\n   A ROOM IN SIR JOHN DAW'S HOUSE.\n\n   ENTER DAW, CLERIMONT, DAUPHINE, AND EPICOENE.\n\n   DAW: Nay, an she will, let her refuse at her own charges: 'tis\n   nothing to me, gentlemen: but she will not be invited to the like\n   feasts or guests every day.\n\n   CLER: O, by no means, she may not refuse--to stay at home, if you\n   love your reputation: 'Slight, you are invited thither o' purpose\n   to be seen, and laughed at by the lady of the college, and her\n   shadows. This trumpeter hath proclaim'd you.\n   [ASIDE TO EPICOENE.]\n\n   DAUP: You shall not go; let him be laugh'd at in your stead, for\n   not bringing you: and put him to his extemporal faculty of fooling\n   and talking loud, to satisfy the company.\n   [ASIDE TO EPICOENE.]\n\n   CLER: He will suspect us, talk aloud.--'Pray, mistress Epicoene,\n   let us see your verses; we have sir John Daw's leave: do not\n   conceal your servant's merit, and your own glories.\n\n   EPI: They'll prove my servant's glories, if you have his leave so\n   soon.\n\n   DAUP: His vain-glories, lady!\n\n   DAW: Shew them, shew them, mistress, I dare own them.\n\n   EPI: Judge you, what glories.\n\n   DAW: Nay, I'll read them myself too: an author must recite his\n   own works. It is a madrigal of Modesty.\n   Modest, and fair, for fair and good are near\n   Neighbours, howe'er.--\n\n   DAUP: Very good.\n\n   CLER: Ay, is't not?\n\n   DAW: No noble virtue ever was alone,\n   But two in one.\n\n   DAUP: Excellent!\n\n   CLER: That again, I pray, sir John.\n\n   DAUP: It has something in't like rare wit and sense.\n\n   CLER: Peace.\n\n   DAW: No noble virtue ever was alone,\n   But two in one.\n   Then, when I praise sweet modesty, I praise\n   Bright beauty's rays:\n   And having praised both beauty and modesty,\n   I have praised thee.\n\n   DAUP: Admirable!\n\n   CLER: How it chimes, and cries tink in the close, divinely!\n\n   DAUP: Ay, 'tis Seneca.\n\n   CLER: No, I think 'tis Plutarch.\n\n   DAW: The dor on Plutarch, and Seneca! I hate it: they are mine own\n   imaginations, by that light. I wonder those fellows have such\n   credit with gentlemen.\n\n   CLER: They are very grave authors.\n\n   DAW: Grave asses! mere essayists: a few loose sentences, and that's\n   all. A man would talk so, his whole age: I do utter as good things\n   every hour, if they were collected and observed, as either of\n   them.\n\n   DAUP: Indeed, sir John!\n\n   CLER: He must needs; living among the wits and braveries too.\n\n   DAUP: Ay, and being president of them, as he is.\n\n   DAW: There's Aristotle, a mere common-place fellow; Plato, a\n   discourser; Thucydides and Livy, tedious and dry; Tacitus, an\n   entire knot: sometimes worth the untying, very seldom.\n\n   CLER: What do you think of the poets, sir John?\n\n   DAW: Not worthy to be named for authors. Homer, an old tedious,\n   prolix ass, talks of curriers, and chines of beef. Virgil of\n   dunging of land, and bees. Horace, of I know not what.\n\n   CLER: I think so.\n\n   DAW: And so Pindarus, Lycophron, Anacreon, Catullus, Seneca the\n   tragedian, Lucan, Propertius, Tibullus, Martial, Juvenal,\n   Ausonius, Statius, Politian, Valerius Flaccus, and the rest--\n\n   CLER: What a sack full of their names he has got!\n\n   DAUP: And how he pours them out! Politian with Valerius Flaccus!\n\n   CLER: Was not the character right of him?\n\n   DAUP: As could be made, i'faith.\n\n   DAW: And Persius, a crabbed coxcomb, not to be endured.\n\n   DAUP: Why, whom do you account for authors, sir John Daw?\n\n   DAW: Syntagma juris civilis; Corpus juris civilis; Corpus juris\n   canonici; the king of Spain's bible--\n\n   DAUP: Is the king of Spain's bible an author?\n\n   CLER: Yes, and Syntagma.\n\n   DAUP: What was that Syntagma, sir?\n\n   DAW: A civil lawyer, a Spaniard.\n\n   DAUP: Sure, Corpus was a Dutchman.\n\n   CLER: Ay, both the Corpuses, I knew 'em: they were very corpulent\n   authors.\n\n   DAW: And, then there's Vatablus, Pomponatius, Symancha: the other\n   are not to be received, within the thought of a scholar.\n\n   DAUP: 'Fore God, you have a simple learned servant, lady,--\n   in titles.

I have written somewhat of her silence\n   too.\n\n   DAUP: In verse, sir John?\n\n   CLER: What else?\n\n   DAUP: Why? how can you justify your own being of a poet, that so\n   slight all the old poets?\n\n   DAW: Why? every man that writes in verse is not a poet; you have of\n   the wits that write verses, and yet are no poets: they are poets\n   that live by it, the poor fellows that live by it.\n\n   DAUP: Why, would not you live by your verses, sir John?\n\n   CLER: No, 'twere pity he should. A knight live by his verses? he\n   did not make them to that end, I hope.\n\n   DAUP: And yet the noble Sidney lives by his, and the noble family\n   not ashamed.\n\n   CLER: Ay, he profest himself; but sir John Daw has more caution:\n   he'll not hinder his own rising in the state so much. Do you\n   think he will? Your verses, good sir John, and no poems.\n\n   DAW: Silence in woman, is like speech in man,\n   Deny't who can.\n\n   DAUP: Not I, believe it: your reason, sir.\n\n   DAW: Nor, is't a tale,\n   That female vice should be a virtue male,\n   Or masculine vice a female virtue be:\n   You shall it see\n   Prov'd with increase;\n   I know to speak, and she to hold her peace.\n   Do you conceive me, gentlemen?\n\n   DAUP: No, faith; how mean you \"with increase,\" sir John?\n\n   DAW: Why, with increase is, when I court her for the common cause of\n   mankind; and she says nothing, but \"consentire videtur\": and in\n   time is gravida.\n\n   DAUP: Then this is a ballad of procreation?\n\n   CLER: A madrigal of procreation; you mistake.\n\n   EPI: 'Pray give me my verses again, servant.\n\n   DAW: If you'll ask them aloud, you shall.\n   [WALKS ASIDE WITH THE PAPERS.]\n\n   [ENTER TRUEWIT WITH HIS HORN.]\n\n   CLER: See, here's Truewit again!--Where hast thou been, in the\n   name of madness! thus accoutred with thy horn?\n\n   TRUE: Where the sound of it might have pierced your sense with\n   gladness, had you been in ear-reach of it. Dauphine, fall down\n   and worship me: I have forbid the bans, lad: I have been with thy\n   virtuous uncle, and have broke the match.\n\n   DAUP: You have not, I hope.\n\n   TRUE: Yes faith; if thou shouldst hope otherwise, I should repent me:\n   this horn got me entrance; kiss it. I had no other way to get in,\n   but by faining to be a post; but when I got in once, I proved none,\n   but rather the contrary, turn'd him into a post, or a stone, or\n   what is stiffer, with thundering into him the incommodities of a\n   wife, and the miseries of marriage. If ever Gorgon were seen in\n   the shape of a woman, he hath seen her in my description: I have\n   put him off o' that scent for ever.--Why do you not applaud and\n   adore me, sirs? why stand you mute? are you stupid?

Gentlemen, come to yourselves again.\n\n   DAUP: But I presaged thus much afore to you.\n\n   CLER: Would my lips had been solder'd when I spake on't. Slight,\n   what moved you to be thus impertinent?\n\n   TRUE: My masters, do not put on this strange face to pay my\n   courtesy; off with this visor.

That which I have plotted\n   for, and been maturing now these four months, you have blasted in a\n   minute: Now I am lost, I may speak. This gentlewoman was lodged\n   here by me o' purpose, and, to be put upon my uncle, hath profest\n   this obstinate silence for my sake; being my entire friend, and\n   one that for the requital of such a fortune as to marry him,\n   would have made me very ample conditions: where now, all my hopes\n   are utterly miscarried by this unlucky accident.\n\n   CLER: Thus 'tis when a man will be ignorantly officious, do\n   services, and not know his why; I wonder what courteous itch\n   possest you. You never did absurder part in your life, nor a\n   greater trespass to friendship or humanity.\n\n   DAUP: Faith, you may forgive it best: 'twas your cause principally.\n\n   CLER: I know it, would it had not.\n\n   [ENTER CUTBEARD.]\n\n   DAUP: How now, Cutbeard! what news?\n\n   CUT: The best, the happiest that ever was, sir.

I am one: I met him even now, upon that he calls his delicate\n   fine black horse, rid into a foam, with posting from place to\n   place, and person to person, to give them the cue--\n\n   CLER: Lest they should forget?\n\n   TRUE: Yes: There was never poor captain took more pains at a\n   muster to shew men, than he, at this meal, to shew friends.\n\n   DAW: It is his quarter-feast, sir.\n\n   CLER: What! do you say so, sir John?\n\n   TRUE: Nay, Jack Daw will not be out, at the best friends he has,\n   to the talent of his wit: Where's his mistress, to hear and applaud\n   him? is she gone?\n\n   DAW: Is mistress Epicoene gone?\n\n   CLER: Gone afore, with sir Dauphine, I warrant, to the place.\n\n   TRUE: Gone afore! that were a manifest injury; a disgrace and a\n   half: to refuse him at such a festival-time as this, being a\n   bravery, and a wit too!\n\n   CLER: Tut, he'll swallow it like cream: he's better read in Jure\n   civili, than to esteem any thing a disgrace, is offer'd him from\n   a mistress.\n\n   DAW: Nay, let her e'en go; she shall sit alone, and be dumb in her\n   chamber a week together, for John Daw, I warrant her. Does she\n   refuse me?\n\n   CLER: No, sir, do not take it so to heart; she does not refuse you,\n   but a little neglects you. Good faith, Truewit, you were to blame,\n   to put it into his head, that she does refuse him.\n\n   TRUE: Sir, she does refuse him palpably, however you mince it. An I\n   were as he, I would swear to speak ne'er a word to her to-day\n   for't.\n\n   DAW: By this light, no more I will not.\n\n   TRUE: Nor to any body else, sir.\n\n   DAW: Nay, I will not say so, gentlemen.\n\n   CLER: It had been an excellent happy condition for the company, if\n   you could have drawn him to it. [ASIDE.]\n\n   DAW: I'll be very melancholY, i'faith.\n\n   CLER: As a dog, if I were as you, sir John.\n\n   TRUE: Or a snail, or a hog-louse: I would roll myself up for this\n   day, in troth, they should not unwind me.\n\n   DAW: By this pick-tooth, so I will.\n\n   CLER: 'Tis well done: He begins already to be angry with his teeth.\n\n   DAW: Will you go, gentlemen?\n\n   CLER: Nay, you must walk alone, if you be right melancholy, sir\n   John.\n\n   TRUE: Yes, sir, we'll dog you, we'll follow you afar off.\n\n   [EXIT DAW.]\n\n   CLER: Was there ever such a two yards of knighthood measured out by\n   time, to be sold to laughter?\n\n   TRUE: A mere talking mole, hang him! no mushroom was ever so fresh.\n   A fellow so utterly nothing, as he knows not what he would be.\n\n   CLER: Let's follow him: but first, let's go to Dauphine, he's\n   hovering about the house to hear what news.\n\n   TRUE: Content.\n\n   [EXEUNT.]\n\n\n   SCENE 2.3.\n\n   A ROOM IN MOROSE'S HOUSE.\n\n   ENTER MOROSE AND MUTE, FOLLOWED BY CUTBEARD WITH EPICOENE.\n\n   MOR: Welcome Cutbeard! draw near with your fair charge: and in her\n   ear softly entreat her to unmasthey.\n   [EPI. TAKES OFF HER MASK.]\n   --So! Is the door shut?\n   [MUTE MAKES A LEG.]\n   --Enough. Now, Cutbeard, with the same discipline I use to my\n   family, I will question you. As I conceive, Cutbeard, this\n   gentlewoman is she you have provided, and brought, in hope she\n   will fit me in the place and person of a wife? Answer me not, but\n   with your leg, unless it be otherwise:\n   [CUT. MAKES A LEG.]\n   --Very well done, Cutbeard. I conceive, besides, Cutbeard, you\n   have been pre-acquainted with her birth, education, and qualities,\n   or else you would not prefer her to my acceptance, in the weighty\n   consequence of marriage.\n   [CUT. MAKES A LEG.]\n   --This I conceive, Cutbeard. Answer me not but with your leg, unless\n   it be otherwise.\n   [CUT. BOWS AGAIN.]\n   --Very well done, Cutbeard. Give aside now a little, and leave me to\n   examine her condition, and aptitude to my affection.\n   [HE GOES ABOUT HER, AND VIEWS HER.]\n   --She is exceeding fair, and of a special good favour; a sweet\n   composition or harmony of limbs: her temper of beauty has the\n   true height of my blood. The knave hath exceedingly well fitted me\n   without: I will now try her within. Come near, fair gentlewoman:\n   let not my behaviour seem rude, though unto you, being rare, it\n   may haply appear strange.\n   [EPICOENE CURTSIES.]\n   --Nay, lady, you may speak, though Cutbeard and my man, might not;\n   for, of all sounds, only the sweet voice of a fair lady has the\n   just length of mine ears. I beseech you, say, lady; out of the\n   first fire of meeting eyes, they say, love is stricken: do you\n   feel any such motion suddenly shot into you, from any part you see\n   in me? ha, lady?\n   [EPICOENE CURTSIES.]\n   --Alas, lady, these answers by silent curtsies from you are too\n   courtless and simple. I have ever had my breeding in court: and\n   she that shall be my wife, must be accomplished with courtly and\n   audacious ornaments. Can you speak, lady?\n\n   EPI: [softly.] Judge you, forsooth.\n\n   MOR: What say you, lady? speak out, I beseech you.\n\n   EPI: Judge you, forsooth.\n\n   MOR: On my judgment, a divine softness! But can you naturally,\n   lady, as I enjoin these by doctrine and industry, refer yourself\n   to the search of my judgment, and, not taking pleasure in your\n   tongue, which is a woman's chiefest pleasure, think it plausible\n   to answer me by silent gestures, so long as my speeches jump\n   right with what you conceive?\n   [EPI. CURTSIES.]\n   --Excellent! divine! if it were possible she should hold out thus!\n   Peace, Cutbeard, thou art made for ever, as thou hast made me, if\n   this felicity have lasting: but I will try her further. Dear lady,\n   I am courtly, I tell you, and I must have mine ears banqueted with\n   pleasant and witty conferences, pretty girls, scoffs, and\n   dalliance in her that I mean to choose for my bed-phere. The\n   ladies in court think it a most desperate impair to their\n   quickness of wit, and good carriage, if they cannot give\n   occasion for a man to court 'em; and when an amorous discourse is\n   set on foot, minister as good matter to continue it, as himself:\n   And do you alone so much differ from all them, that what they,\n   with so much circumstance, affect and toil for, to seem\n   learn'd, to seem judicious, to seem sharp and conceited, you\n   can bury in yourself with silence, and rather trust your graces\n   to the fair conscience of virtue, than to the world's or your own\n   proclamation?\n\n   EPI [SOFTLY]: I should be sorry else.\n\n   MOR: What say you lady? good lady, speak out.\n\n   EPI: I should be sorry else.\n\n   MOR: That sorrow doth fill me with gladness. O Morose, thou art\n   happy above mankind! pray that thou mayest contain thyself. I\n   will only put her to it once more, and it shall be with the utmost\n   touch and test of their sex. But hear me, fair lady; I do also\n   love to see her whom I shall choose for my heifer, to be the\n   first and principal in all fashions; precede all the dames at\n   court by a fortnight; have council of tailors, lineners,\n   lace-women, embroiderers, and sit with them sometimes twice a day\n   upon French intelligences; and then come forth varied like\n   nature, or oftener than she, and better by the help of art, her\n   emulous servant. This do I affect: and how will you be able, lady,\n   with this frugality of speech, to give the manifold but\n   necessary instructions, for that bodice, these sleeves, those\n   skirts, this cut, that stitch, this embroidery, that lace, this\n   wire, those knots, that ruff, those roses, this girdle, that\n   fanne, the t'other scarf, these gloves? Ha! what say you, lady?\n\n   EPI [SOFTLY]: I'll leave it to you, sir.\n\n   MOR: How, lady? pray you rise a note.\n\n   EPI: I leave it to wisdom and you, sir.\n\n   MOR: Admirable creature! I will trouble you no more: I will not\n   sin against so sweet a simplicity. Let me now be bold to print on\n   those divine lips the seal of being mine.--Cutbeard, I give thee\n   the lease of thy house free: thank me not but with thy leg\n   [CUTBEARD SHAKES HIS HEAD.]\n   --I know what thou wouldst say, she's poor, and her friends\n   deceased. She has brought a wealthy dowry in her silence, Cutbeard;\n   and in respect of her poverty, Cutbeard, I shall have her more\n   loving and obedient, Cutbeard.

This night I will get an\n   heir, and thrust him out of my blood, like a stranger; he would be\n   knighted, forsooth, and thought by that means to reign over me;\n   his title must do it: No, kinsman, I will now make you bring me\n   the tenth lord's and the sixteenth lady's letter, kinsman; and it\n   shall do you no good, kinsman. Your knighthood itself shall come\n   on its knees, and it shall be rejected; it shall be sued for its\n   fees to execution, and not be redeem'd; it shall cheat at the\n   twelvepenny ordinary, it knighthood, for its diet, all the term-\n   time, and tell tales for it in the vacation to the hostess; or it\n   knighthood shall do worse, take sanctuary in Cole-harbour, and fast.\n   It shall fright all its friends with borrowing letters; and when\n   one of the fourscore hath brought it knighthood ten shillings, it\n   knighthood shall go to the Cranes, or the Bear at the Bridge-foot,\n   and be drunk in fear: it shall not have money to discharge one\n   tavern-reckoning, to invite the old creditors to forbear it\n   knighthood, or the new, that should be, to trust it knighthood. It\n   shall be the tenth name in the bond to take up the commodity of\n   pipkins and stone jugs: and the part thereof shall not furnish it\n   knighthood forth for the attempting of a baker's widow, a brown\n   baker's widow. It shall give it knighthood's name, for a stallion,\n   to all gamesome citizens' wives, and be refused; when the master\n   of a dancing school, or how do you call him, the worst reveller in\n   the town is taken: it shall want clothes, and by reason of that,\n   wit, to fool to lawyers. It shall not have hope to repair itself\n   by Constantinople, Ireland, or Virginia; but the best and last fortune\n   to it knighthood shall be to make Dol Tear-Sheet, or Kate Common a\n   lady: and so it knighthood may eat.\n\n   [EXIT.]\n\n   SCENE 2.4.\n\n   A LANE, NEAR MOROSE'S HOUSE.\n\n   ENTER TRUEWIT, DAUPHINE,AND CLERIMONT.\n\n   TRUE: Are you sure he is not gone by?\n\n   DAUP: No, I staid in the shop ever since.\n\n   CLER: But he may take the other end of the lane.\n\n   DAUP: No, I told him I would be here at this end: I appointed him\n   hither.\n\n   TRUE: What a barbarian it is to stay then!\n\n   DAUP: Yonder he comes.\n\n   CLER: And his charge left behind him, which is a very good sign,\n   Dauphine.\n\n   [ENTER CUTBEARD.]\n\n   DAUP: How now Cutbeard! succeeds it, or no?\n\n   CUT: Past imagination, sir, omnia secunda; you could not have\n   pray'd to have had it so well.

At this instant he is\n   marshalling of his bull, bear, and horse.\n\n   DAUP: What be those, in the name of Sphynx?\n\n   TRUE: Why, sir, he has been a great man at the Bear-garden in his\n   time; and from that subtle sport, has ta'en the witty denomination\n   of his chief carousing cups.

You were best bait me with your bull,\n   bear, and horse! Never a time that the courtiers or collegiates\n   come to the house, but you make it a Shrove-tuesday!

What did you bring me, should make you thus\n   peremptory? do I allow you your half-crown a day, to spend where\n   you will, among your gamsters, to vex and torment me at such\n   times as these?

And did not I take you up from thence,\n   in an old greasy buff-doublet, with points, and green velvet\n   sleeves, out at the elbows? you forget this.\n\n   TRUE: She'll worry him, if we help not in time.\n\n   [THEY COME FORWARD.]\n\n   MRS.

Here was a very\n   melancholy knight in a ruff, that demanded my subject for somebody,\n   a gentleman, I think.\n\n   CLER: Ay, that was he, lady.\n\n   MRS. OTT: But he departed straight, I can resolve you.\n\n   DAUP: What an excellent choice phrase this lady expresses in.\n\n   TRUE: O, sir, she is the only authentical courtier, that is not\n   naturally bred one, in the city.\n\n   MRS. OTT: You have taken that report upon trust, gentlemen.\n\n   TRUE: No, I assure you, the court governs it so, lady, in your\n   behalf.\n\n   MRS. OTT: I am the servant of the court and courtiers, sir.\n\n   TRUE: They are rather your idolaters.\n\n   MRS.

I have so pleased him with a curate, that he's gone\n   to't almost with the delight he hopes for soon.\n\n   DAUP: What is he for a vicar?\n\n   CUT: One that has catch'd a cold, sir, and can scarce be heard six\n   inches off; as if he spoke out of a bulrush that were not pick'd,\n   or his throat were full of pith: a fine quick fellow, and an\n   excellent barber of prayers. I came to tell you, sir, that you\n   might omnem movere lapidem, as they say, be ready with your\n   vexation.\n\n   DAUP: Gramercy, honest Cutbeard! be thereabouts with thy key,\n   to let us in.\n\n   CUT: I will not fail you, sir: ad manum.\n\n   [EXIT.]\n\n   TRUE: Well, I'll go watch my coaches.\n\n   CLER: Do; and we'll send Daw to you, if you meet him not.\n\n   [EXIT TRUEWIT.]\n\n   MRS. OTT: Is master Truewit gone?\n\n   DAUP: Yes, lady, there is some unfortunate business fallen out.\n\n   MRS. OTT: So I adjudged by the physiognomy of the fellow that came\n   in; and I had a dream last night too of a new pageant, and my lady\n   mayoress, which is always very ominous to me. I told it my lady\n   Haughty t'other day; when her honour came hither to see some\n   China stuffs: and she expounded it out of Artemidorus, and I have\n   found it since very true. It has done me many affronts.\n\n   CLER: Your dream, lady?\n\n   MRS. OTT: Yes, sir, any thing I do but dream of the city. It\n   stain'd me a damasque table-cloth, cost me eighteen pound, at one\n   time; and burnt me a black satin gown, as I stood by the fire,\n   at my lady Centaure's chamber in the college, another time. A\n   third time, at the lord's masque, it dropt all my wire and my\n   ruff with wax candle, that I could not go up to the banquet. A\n   fourth time, as I was taking coach to go to Ware, to meet a\n   friend, it dash'd me a new suit all over (a crimson satin\n   doublet, and black velvet skirts) with a brewer's horse, that\n   I was fain to go in and shift me, and kept my chamber a leash\n   of days for the anguish of it.\n\n   DAUP: These were dire mischances, lady.\n\n   CLER: I would not dwell in the city, an 'twere so fatal to me.\n\n   MRS. OTT: Yes sir, but I do take advice of my doctor to dream\n   of it as little as I can.\n\n   DAUP: You do well, mistress Otter.\n\n   MRS. OTT: Will it please you to enter the house farther,\n   gentlemen?\n\n   DAUP: And your favour, lady: but we stay to speak with a knight,\n   sir John Daw, who is here come. We shall follow you, lady.\n\n   MRS. OTT: At your own time, sir. It is my cousin sir Amorous his\n   feast--\n\n   DAUP: I know it, lady.\n\n   MRS. OTT: And mine together. But it is for his honour, and\n   therefore I take no name of it, more than of the place.\n\n   DAUP: You are a bounteous kinswoman.\n\n   MRS. OTT: Your servant, sir.\n\n   [EXIT.]\n\n   CLER [COMING FORWARD WITH DAW.]: Why, do not you know it, sir\n   John Daw?\n\n   DAW: No, I am a rook if I do.\n\n   CLER: I'll tell you then, she's married by this time. And, whereas\n   you were put in the head, that she was gone with sir Dauphine, I\n   assure you, sir Dauphine has been the noblest, honestest friend to\n   you, that ever gentleman of your quality could boast of. He has\n   discover'd the whole plot, and made your mistress so acknowledging,\n   and indeed so ashamed of her injury to you, that she desires you\n   to forgive her, and but grace her wedding with your presence\n   to-day--She is to be married to a very good fortune, she says, his\n   uncle, old Morose: and she will'd me in private to tell you, that\n   she shall be able to do you more favours, and with more security\n   now, than before.\n\n   DAW: Did she say so, i'faith?\n\n   CLER: Why, what do you think of me, sir John? ask sir Dauphine.\n\n   DAUP: Nay, I believe you.--Good sir Dauphine, did she desire me to\n   forgive her?\n\n   CLER: I assure you, sir John, she did.\n\n   DAW: Nay, then, I do with all my heart, and I'll be jovial.\n\n   CLER: Yes, for look you, sir, this was the injury to you. La-Foole\n   intended this feast to honour her bridal day, and made you the\n   property to invite the college ladies, and promise to bring her:\n   and then at the time she should have appear'd, as his friend, to\n   have given you the dor. Whereas now, Sir Dauphine has brought her\n   to a feeling of it, with this kind of satisfaction, that you shall\n   bring all the ladies to the place where she is, and be very\n   jovial; and there, she will have a dinner, which shall be in your\n   name: and so disappoint La-Foole, to make you good again, and, as\n   it were, a saver in the main.\n\n   DAW: As I am a knight, I honour her; and forgive her heartily.\n\n   CLER: About it then presently. Truewit is gone before to confront\n   the coaches, and to acquaint you with so much, if he meet you.\n   Join with him, and 'tis well.--\n   [ENTER SIR AMOROUS LAFOOLE.]\n   See; here comes your antagonist, but take you no notice, but be\n   very jovial.\n\n   LA-F: Are the ladies come, sir John Daw, and your mistress?\n   [EXIT DAW.]\n   --Sir Dauphine! you are exceeding welcome, and honest master\n   Clerimont. Where's my cousin? did you see no collegiates, gentlemen?\n\n   DAUP: Collegiates! do you not hear, sir Amorous, how you are abus'd?\n\n   LA-F: How, sir!\n\n   CLER: Will you speak so kindly to sir John Daw, that has done you\n   such an affront?\n\n   LA-F: Wherein, gentlemen? let me be a suitor to you to know, I\n   beseech you!\n\n   CLER: Why, sir, his mistress is married to-day to sir Dauphine's\n   uncle, your cousin's neighbour, and he has diverted all the ladies,\n   and all your company thither, to frustrate your provision, and stick\n   a disgrace upon you. He was here now to have enticed us away from\n   you too: but we told him his own, I think.\n\n   LA-F: Has sir John Daw wrong'd me so inhumanly?\n\n   DAUP: He has done it, sir Amorous, most maliciously and\n   treacherously: but, if youll be ruled by us, you shall quit him,\n   i'faith.\n\n   LA-F: Good gentlemen, I'll make one, believe it. How, I pray?\n\n   DAUP: Marry sir, get me your pheasants, and your godwits, and your\n   best meat, and dish it in silver dishes of your cousin's presently,\n   and say nothing, but clap me a clean towel about you, like a sewer;\n   and bare-headed, march afore it with a good confidence, ('tis but\n   over the way, hard by,) and we'll second you, where you shall set\n   it on the board, and bid them welcome to't, which shall shew 'tis\n   yours, and disgrace his preparation utterly: and, for your cousin,\n   whereas she should be troubled here at home with care of making and\n   giving welcome, she shall transfer all that labour thither, and be\n   a principal guest herself, sit rank'd with the college-honours, and\n   be honour'd, and have her health drunk as often, as bare and as\n   loud as the best of them.\n\n   LA-F: I'll go tell her presently.

They'll believe themselves\n   to be just such men as we make them, neither more nor less. They\n   have nothing, not the use of their senses, but by tradition.\n\n   [RE-ENTER LA-FOOLE, LIKE A SEWER.]\n\n   CLER: See! sir Amorous has his towel on already. Have you persuaded\n   your cousin?\n\n   LA-F: Yes, 'tis very feasible: she'll do any thing she says, rather\n   than the La-Fooles shall be disgraced.\n\n   DAUP: She is a noble kinswoman. It will be such a pestling device,\n   sir Amorous; it will pound all your enemy's practices to powder,\n   and blow him up with his own mine, his own train.\n\n   LA-F: Nay, we'll give fire, I warrant you.\n\n   CLER: But you must carry it privately, without any noise, and take\n   no notice by any means--\n\n   [RE-ENTER CAPTAIN OTTER.]\n\n   OTT: Gentlemen, my princess says you shall have all her silver\n   dishes, festinate: and she's gone to alter her tire a little,\n   and go with you--\n\n   CLER: And yourself too, captain Otter?\n\n   DAUP: By any means, sir.\n\n   OTT: Yes, sir, I do mean it: but I would entreat my cousin sir\n   Amorous, and you, gentlemen, to be suitors to my princess, that I\n   may carry my bull and my bear, as well as my horse.\n\n   CLER: That you shall do, captain Otter.\n\n   LA-F: My cousin will never consent, gentlemen.\n\n   DAUP: She must consent, sir Amorous, to reason.\n\n   LA-F: Why, she says they are no decorum among ladies.\n\n   OTT: But they are decora, and that's better, sir.\n\n   CLER: Ay, she must hear argument. Did not Pasiphae, who was a\n   queen, love a bull? and was not Calisto, the mother of Arcas,\n   turn'd into a bear, and made a star, mistress Ursula, in the\n   heavens?\n\n   OTT: O lord! that I could have said as much! I will have these\n   stories painted in the Bear-garden, ex Ovidii metamorphosi.\n\n   DAUP: Where is your princess, captain? pray, be our leader.\n\n   OTT: That I shall, sir.\n\n   CLER: Make haste, good sir Amorous.\n\n   [EXEUNT.]\n\n   SCENE 3.2.\n\n   A ROOM IN MOROSE'S HOUSE.\n\n   ENTER MOROSE, EPICOENE, PARSON, AND CUTBEARD.\n\n   MOR: Sir, there is an angel for yourself, and a brace of angels\n   for your cold.

He got this cold with sitting up late,\n   and singing catches with cloth-workers.\n\n   MOR: No more. I thank him.\n\n   PAR: God keep your worship, and give you much joy with your fair\n   spouse.--[COUGHS.] uh! uh! uh!\n\n   MOR: O, O! stay Cutbeard! let him give me five shillings of my\n   money back.

Why, did you think you had married a statue, or a\n   motion, only? one of the French puppets, with the eyes turn'd with\n   a wire? or some innocent out of the hospital, that would stand\n   with her hands thus, and a plaise mouth, and look upon you?\n\n   MOR: O immodesty! a manifest woman! What, Cutbeard!\n\n   EPI: Nay, never quarrel with Cutbeard, sir; it is too late now. I\n   confess it doth bate somewhat of the modesty I had, when I writ\n   simply maid: but I hope, I shall make it a stock still competent\n   to the estate and dignity of your wife.\n\n   MOR: She can talk!\n\n   EPI: Yes, indeed, sir.\n\n   [ENTER MUTE.]\n\n   MOR: What sirrah!

I commend your resolution, that,\n   notwithstanding all the dangers I laid afore you, in the voice of\n   a night-crow, would yet go on, and be yourself. It shews you are\n   a man constant to your own ends, and upright to your purposes,\n   that would not be put off with left-handed cries.\n\n   MOR: How should you arrive at the knowledge of so much!\n\n   TRUE: Why, did you ever hope, sir, committing the secrecy of it to\n   a barber, that less then the whole town should know it? you might\n   as well have told it the conduit, or the bake-house, or the\n   infantry that follow the court, and with more security. Could\n   your gravity forget so old and noted a remnant, as lippis et\n   tonsoribus notum? Well, sir, forgive it yourself now, the fault,\n   and be communicable with your friends.

Would you go to bed so\n   presently, sir, afore noon? a man of your head and hair should\n   owe more to that reverend ceremony, and not mount the marriage-bed\n   like a town-bull, or a mountain-goat; but stay the due season; and\n   ascend it then with religion and fear. Those delights are to be\n   steeped in the humour and silence of the night; and give the day\n   to other open pleasures, and jollities of feasting, of music, of\n   revels, of discourse: we'll have all, sir, that may make your\n   Hymen high and happy.\n\n   MOR: O, my torment, my torment!\n\n   TRUE: Nay, if you endure the first half hour, sir, so tediously,\n   and with this irksomness; what comfort or hope can this fair\n   gentlewoman make to herself hereafter, in the consideration of so\n   many years as are to come--\n\n   MOR: Of my affliction.

Women ought to repair the\n   losses time and years have made in their features, with dressings.\n   And an intelligent woman, if she know by herself the least defect,\n   will be most curious to hide it: and it becomes her. If she be\n   short, let her sit much, lest, when she stands, she be thought to\n   sit. If she have an ill foot, let her wear her gown the longer,\n   and her shoe the thinner. If a fat hand, and scald nails, let her\n   carve the less, and act in gloves. If a sour breath, let her never\n   discourse fasting, and always talk at her distance. If she have\n   black and rugged teeth, let her offer the less at laughter,\n   especially if she laugh wide and open.\n\n   CLER: O, you shall have some women, when they laugh, you would\n   think they brayed, it is so rude, and--\n\n   TRUE: Ay, and others, that will stalk in their gait like an estrich,\n   and take huge strides. I cannot endure such a sight. I love measure\n   in the feet, and number in the voice: they are gentlenesses, that\n   oftentimes draw no less than the face.\n\n   DAUP: How camest thou to study these creatures so exactly? I would\n   thou would'st make me a proficient.\n\n   TRUE: Yes, but you must leave to live in your chamber, then, a\n   month together upon Amadis de Gaul, or Don Quixote, as you are\n   wont; and come abroad where the matter is frequent, to court, to\n   tiltings, public shows and feasts, to plays, and church sometimes:\n   thither they come to shew their new tires too, to see, and to be\n   seen. In these places a man shall find whom to love, whom to play\n   with, whom to touch once, whom to hold ever. The variety arrests\n   his judgment. A wench to please a man comes not down dropping\n   from the ceiling, as he lies on his back droning a tobacco pipe.\n   He must go where she is.\n\n   DAUP: Yes, and be never the nearer.\n\n   TRUE: Out, heretic! That diffidence makes thee worthy it should\n   be so.\n\n   CLER: He says true to you, Dauphine.\n\n   DAUP: Why?\n\n   TRUE: A man should not doubt to overcome any woman. Think he can\n   vanquish them, and he shall: for though they deny, their desire\n   is to be tempted. Penelope herself cannot hold out long. Ostend,\n   you saw, was taken at last. You must persever, and hold to your\n   purpose. They would solicit us, but that they are afraid.\n   Howsoever, they wish in their hearts we should solicit them.\n   Praise them, flatter them, you shall never want eloquence or\n   trust: even the chastest delight to feel themselves that way\n   rubb'd. With praises you must mix kisses too: if they take them,\n   they'll take more--though they strive, they would be overcome.\n\n   CLER: O, but a man must beware of force.\n\n   TRUE: It is to them an acceptable violence, and has oft-times the\n   place of the greatest courtesy. She that might have been forced,\n   and you let her go free without touching, though then she seem to\n   thank you, will ever hate you after; and glad in the face, is\n   assuredly sad at the heart.\n\n   CLER: But all women are not to be taken all ways.\n\n   TRUE: 'Tis true; no more than all birds, or all fishes. If you\n   appear learned to an ignorant wench, or jocund to a sad, or witty\n   to a foolish, why she presently begins to mistrust herself. You\n   must approach them in their own height, their own line: for the\n   contrary makes many, that fear to commit themselves to noble and\n   worthy fellows, run into the embraces of a rascal. If she love\n   wit, give verses, though you borrow them of a friend, or buy them,\n   to have good. If valour, talk of your sword, and be frequent in\n   the mention of quarrels, though you be staunch in fighting. If\n   activity, be seen on your barbary often, or leaping over stools,\n   for the credit of your back. If she love good clothes or dressing,\n   have your learned council about you every morning, your French\n   tailor, barber, linener, etc. Let your powder, your glass, and\n   your comb be your dearest acquaintance. Take more care for the\n   ornament of your head, than the safety: and wish the commonwealth\n   rather troubled, than a hair about you. That will take her. Then,\n   if she be covetous and craving, do you promise any thing, and\n   perform sparingly; so shall you keep her in appetite still. Seem\n   as you would give, but be like a barren field, that yields little,\n   or unlucky dice to foolish and hoping gamesters. Let your gifts\n   be slight and dainty, rather than precious. Let cunning be above\n   cost. Give cherries at time of year, or apricots; and say they\n   were sent you out of the country, though you bought them in\n   Cheapside. Admire her tires: like her in all fashions; compare her\n   in every habit to some deity; invent excellent dreams to flatter\n   her, and riddles; or, if she be a great one, perform always the\n   second parts to her: like what she likes, praise whom she praises,\n   and fail not to make the household and servants yours, yea the\n   whole family, and salute them by their names: ('tis but light cost\n   if you can purchase them so,) and make her physician your\n   pensioner, and her chief woman. Nor will it be out of your gain to\n   make love to her too, so she follow, not usher her lady's\n   pleasure. All blabbing is taken away, when she comes to be a part\n   of the crime.\n\n   DAUP: On what courtly lap hast thou late slept, to come forth so\n   sudden and absolute a courtling?\n\n   TRUE: Good faith, I should rather question you, that are so\n   harkening after these mysteries. I begin to suspect your\n   diligence, Dauphine. Speak, art thou in love in earnest?\n\n   DAUP: Yes, by my troth am I: 'twere ill dissembling before thee.\n\n   TRUE: With which of them, I prithee?\n\n   DAUP: With all the collegiates.\n\n   CLER: Out on thee! We'll keep you at home, believe it, in the\n   stable, if you be such a stallion.\n\n   TRUE: No; I like him well. Men should love wisely, and all women;\n   some one for the face, and let her please the eye; another for\n   the skin, and let her please the touch; a third for the voice, and\n   let her please the ear; and where the objects mix, let the senses\n   so too. Thou would'st think it strange, if I should make them all\n   in love with thee afore night!\n\n   DAUP: I would say, thou had'st the best philtre in the world, and\n   couldst do more than madam Medea, or doctor Foreman.\n\n   TRUE: If I do not, let me play the mountebank for my meat, while I\n   live, and the bawd for my drink.\n\n   DAUP: So be it, I say.\n\n   [ENTER OTTER, WITH HIS THREE CUPS, DAW, AND LA-FOOLE.]\n\n   OTT: O Lord, gentlemen, how my knights and I have mist you here!\n\n   CLER: Why, captain, what service? what service?\n\n   OTT: To see me bring up my bull, bear, and horse to fight.\n\n   DAW: Yes, faith, the captain says we shall be his dogs to bait\n   them.\n\n   DAUP: A good employment.\n\n   TRUE: Come on, let's see a course, then.\n\n   LA-F: I am afraid my cousin will be offended, if she come.\n\n   OTT: Be afraid of nothing.

Drive them out of your company, 'tis all\n   I ask; which cannot be any way better done, than by extolling\n   Dauphine, whom they have so slighted.\n\n   EPI: I warrant you; you shall expect one of them presently.\n\n   [EXIT.]\n\n   CLER: What a cast of kestrils are these, to hawk after ladies,\n   thus!\n\n   TRUE: Ay, and strike at such an eagle as Dauphine.\n\n   CLER: He will be mad when we tell him. Here he comes.\n\n   [RE-ENTER DAUPHINE.]\n\n   CLER: O sir, you are welcome.\n\n   TRUE: Where's thine uncle?\n\n   DAUP: Run out of doors in his night-caps, to talk with a casuist\n   about his divorce. It works admirably.\n\n   TRUE: Thou wouldst have said so, if thou hadst been here! The\n   ladies have laugh'd at thee most comically, since thou went'st,\n   Dauphine.\n\n   CLER: And ask'd, if thou wert thine uncle's keeper.\n\n   TRUE: And the brace of baboons answer'd, Yes; and said thou wert\n   a pitiful poor fellow, and didst live upon posts: and hadst\n   nothing but three suits of apparel, and some few benevolences that\n   lords gave thee to fool to them, and swagger.\n\n   DAUP: Let me not live, I will beat them: I'll bind them both to\n   grand-madam's bed-posts, and have them baited with monkies.\n\n   TRUE: Thou shalt not need, they shall be beaten to thy hand,\n   Dauphine. I have an execution to serve upon them, I warrant thee,\n   shall serve; trust my plot.\n\n   DAUP: Ay, you have many plots! so you had one to make all the\n   wenches in love with me.\n\n   TRUE: Why, if I do not yet afore night, as near as 'tis; and\n   that they do not every one invite thee, and be ready to scratch\n   for thee, take the mortgage of my wit.\n\n   CLER: 'Fore God, I'll be his witness thou shalt have it,\n   Dauphine: thou shalt be his fool for ever, if thou doest not.\n\n   TRUE: Agreed. Perhaps 'twill be the better estate. Do you observe\n   this gallery, or rather lobby, indeed? Here are a couple of\n   studies, at each end one: here will I act such a tragi-comedy\n   between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, Daw and La-Foole--which\n   of them comes out first, will I seize on:--you two shall be the\n   chorus behind the arras, and whip out between the acts and\n   speak--If I do not make them keep the peace for this remnant of\n   the day, if not of the year, I have failed once--I hear Daw\n   coming: hide,\n   [THEY WITHDRAW]\n   and do not laugh, for God's sake.\n\n   [RE-ENTER DAW.]\n\n   DAW: Which is the way into the garden trow?\n\n   TRUE: O, Jack Daw!

I must have it\n   taken up.\n\n   DAW: What matter, sir? between whom?\n\n   TRUE: Come, you disguise it: sir Amorous and you. If you love me,\n   Jack, you shall make use of your philosophy now, for this once,\n   and deliver me your sword. This is not the wedding the Centaurs\n   were at, though there be a she one here.\n   [TAKES HIS SWORD.]\n   The bride has entreated me I will see no blood shed at her bridal,\n   you saw her whisper me erewhile.\n\n   DAW: As I hope to finish Tacitus, I intend no murder.\n\n   TRUE: Do you not wait for sir Amorous?\n\n   DAW: Not I, by my knighthood.\n\n   TRUE: And your scholarship too?\n\n   DAW: And my scholarship too.\n\n   TRUE: Go to, then I return you your sword, and ask you mercy; but\n   put it not up, for you will be assaulted. I understood that you\n   had apprehended it, and walked here to brave him: and that you\n   had held your life contemptible, in regard of your honour.\n\n   DAW: No, no; no such thing, I assure you. He and I parted now,\n   as good friends as could be.\n\n   TRUE: Trust not you to that visor. I saw him since dinner with\n   another face: I have known many men in my time vex'd with losses,\n   with deaths, and with abuses; but so offended a wight as sir\n   Amorous, did I never see, or read of. For taking away his guests,\n   sir, to-day, that's the cause: and he declares it behind your back\n   with such threatenings and contempts--He said to Dauphine, you\n   were the arrant'st ass--\n\n   DAW: Ay, he may say his pleasure.\n\n   TRUE: And swears you are so protested a coward, that he knows you\n   will never do him any manly or single right, and therefore he will\n   take his course.\n\n   DAW: I'll give him any satisfaction, sir--but fighting.\n\n   TRUE: Ay, sir: but who knows what satisfaction he'll take? blood\n   he thirsts for, and blood he will have: and whereabouts on you he\n   will have it, who knows but himself?\n\n   DAW: I pray you, master Truewit, be you a mediator.\n\n   TRUE: Well, sir, conceal yourself then in this study till I\n   return.\n   [PUTS HIM INTO THE STUDY.]\n   Nay, you must be content to be lock'd in: for, for mine own\n   reputation, I would not have you seen to receive a public\n   disgrace, while I have the matter in managing. Ods so, here he\n   comes; keep your breath close, that he do not hear you sigh.\n   In good faith, sir Amorous, he is not this way; I pray you be\n   merciful, do not murder him; he is a Christian, as good as you:\n   you are arm'd as if you sought revenge on all his race. Good\n   Dauphine, get him away from this place. I never knew a man's\n   choler so high, but he would speak to his friends, he would hear\n   reason.--Jack Daw, Jack! asleep!\n\n   DAW [within]: Is he gone, master Truewit?\n\n   TRUE: Ay; did you hear him?\n\n   DAW: O lord! yes.\n\n   TRUE: What a quick ear fear has!\n\n   DAW [COMES OUT OF THE CLOSET.]: But is he so arm'd, as you say?\n\n   TRUE: Arm'd? did you ever see a fellow set out to take possession?\n\n   DAW: Ay, sir.\n\n   TRUE: That may give you some light to conceive of him: but 'tis\n   nothing to the principal. Some false brother in the house has\n   furnish'd him strangely; or, if it were out of the house, it was\n   Tom Otter.\n\n   DAW: Indeed he's a captain, and his wife is his kinswoman.\n\n   TRUE: He has got some body's old two-hand sword, to mow you off\n   at the knees; and that sword hath spawn'd such a dagger!--But\n   then he is so hung with pikes, halberds, petronels, calivers and\n   muskets, that he looks like a justice of peace's hall: a man of\n   two thousand a-year, is not cess'd at so many weapons as he has on.\n   There was never fencer challenged at so many several foils. You\n   would think he meant to murder all Saint Pulchre parish. If he\n   could but victual himself for half a year in his breeches, he is\n   sufficiently arm'd to over-run a country.\n\n   DAW: Good lord! what means he, sir? I pray you, master Truewit, be\n   you a mediator.\n\n   TRUE: Well, I 'll try if he will be appeased with a leg or an arm;\n   if not you must die once.\n\n   DAW: I would be loth to lose my right arm, for writing madrigals.\n\n   TRUE: Why, if he will be satisfied with a thumb or a little finger,\n   all's one to me. You must think, I will do my best.\n\n   [SHUTS HIM UP AGAIN.]\n\n   DAW: Good sir, do.\n\n   [CLERIMONT AND DAUPHINE COME FORWARD.]\n\n   CLER: What hast thou done?\n\n   TRUE: He will let me do nothing, he does all afore; he offers\n   his left arm.\n\n   CLER: His left wing for a Jack Daw.\n\n   DAUP: Take it, by all means.\n\n   TRUE: How! maim a man for ever, for a jest? What a conscience hast\n   thou!\n\n   DAUP: 'Tis no loss to him; he has no employment for his arms, but\n   to eat spoon-meat. Beside, as good maim his body as his reputation.\n\n   TRUE: He is a scholar, and a wit, and yet he does not think so.\n   But he loses no reputation with us; for we all resolved him an ass\n   before. To your places again.\n\n   CLER: I pray thee, let me be in at the other a little.\n\n   TRUE: Look, you'll spoil all: these be ever your tricks.\n\n   CLER: No, but I could hit of some things that thou wilt miss, and\n   thou wilt say are good ones.\n\n   TRUE: I warrant you. I pray forbear, I will leave it off, else.\n\n   DAUP: Come away, Clerimont.\n\n   [DAUP. AND CLER.

I'll hide myself.\n\n   TRUE: Do, good sir. But what have you done to him within, that\n   should provoke him thus? You have broke some jest upon him, afore\n   the ladies.\n\n   LA-F: Not I, never in my life, broke jest upon any man. The bride\n   was praising sir Dauphine, and he went away in snuff, and I\n   followed him, unless he took offence at me in his drink erewhile,\n   that I would not pledge all the horse full.\n\n   TRUE: By my faith, and that may be, you remember well: but he walks\n   the round up and down, through every room o' the house, with a\n   towel in his hand, crying, Where's La-Foole? Who saw La-Foole?\n   and when Dauphine and I demanded the cause, we can force no\n   answer from him, but--O revenge, how sweet art thou! I will\n   strangle him in this towel--which leads us to conjecture that the\n   main cause of his fury is, for bringing your meat to-day, with a\n   towel about you, to his discredit.\n\n   LA-F: Like enough. Why, if he be angry for that, I'll stay here\n   till his anger be blown over.\n\n   TRUE: A good becoming resolution, sir; if you can put it on o'\n   the sudden.\n\n   LA-F: Yes, I can put it on: or, I'll away into the country\n   presently.\n\n   TRUE: How will you get out of the house, sir? he knows you are in\n   the house, and he will watch you this se'ennight, but he'll have\n   you. He'll outwait a serjeant for you.\n\n   LA-F: Why, then I'll stay here.\n\n   TRUE: You must think how to victual yourself in time then.\n\n   LA-F: Why, sweet master Truewit, will you entreat my cousin Otter\n   to send me a cold venison pasty, a bottle or two of wine, and a\n   chamber-pot?\n\n   TRUE: A stool were better, sir, of sir Ajax his invention.\n\n   LA-F: Ay, that will be better, indeed; and a pallet to lie on.\n\n   TRUE: O, I would not advise you to sleep by any means.\n\n   LA-F: Would you not, sir? why, then I will not.\n\n   TRUE: Yet, there's another fear--\n\n   LA-F: Is there! what is't?\n\n   TRUE: No, he cannot break open this door with his foot, sure.\n\n   LA-F: I'll set my back against it, sir. I have a good back.\n\n   TRUE: But then if he should batter.\n\n   LA-F: Batter! if he dare, I'll have an action of battery against\n   him.\n\n   TRUE: Cast you the worst. He has sent for powder already, and what\n   he will do with it, no man knows: perhaps blow up the corner of\n   the house where he suspects you are. Here he comes; in quickly.\n   [THRUSTS IN LA-FOOLE AND SHUTS THE DOOR.]\n   I protest, sir John Daw, he is not this way: what will you do?\n   before God, you shall hang no petard here. I'll die rather. Will\n   you not take my word? I never knew one but would be satisfied.--\n   Sir Amorous,\n   [SPEAKS THROUGH THE KEY-HOLE,]\n   there's no standing out: He has made a petard of an old brass\n   pot, to force your door. Think upon some satisfaction, or terms\n   to offer him.\n\n   LA-F [WITHIN.]: Sir, I will give him any satisfaction: I dare\n   give any terms.\n\n   TRUE: You'll leave it to me, then?\n\n   LA-F: Ay, sir.

Why, he shall have them.\n\n   TRUE: But he shall not, sir, by your leave. The conclusion is this,\n   sir: because you shall be very good friends hereafter, and this\n   never to be remembered or upbraided; besides, that he may not\n   boast he has done any such thing to you in his own person: he is\n   to come here in disguise, give you five kicks in private, sir, take\n   your sword from you, and lock you up in that study during pleasure:\n   which will be but a little while, we'll get it released presently.\n\n   DAW: Five kicks! he shall have six, sir, to be friends.\n\n   TRUE: Believe me, you shall not over-shoot yourself, to send him\n   that word by me.\n\n   DAW: Deliver it, sir: he shall have it with all my heart, to be\n   friends.\n\n   TRUE: Friends! Nay, an he should not be so, and heartily too, upon\n   these terms, he shall have me to enemy while I live.

Why, all their actions are\n   governed by crude opinion, without reason or cause; they know not\n   why they do any thing: but, as they are inform'd, believe, judge,\n   praise, condemn, love, hate, and in emulation one of another, do\n   all these things alike.

I wonder how these common forms, as God save\n   you, and You are welcome, are come to be a habit in our lives:\n   or, I am glad to see you! when I cannot see what the profit can\n   be of these words, so long as it is no whit better with him whose\n   affairs are sad and grievous, that he hears this salutation.\n\n   TRUE: 'Tis true, sir; we'll go to the matter then.--Gentlemen,\n   master doctor, and master parson, I have acquainted you\n   sufficiently with the business for which you are come hither; and\n   you are not now to inform yourselves in the state of the question,\n   I know. This is the gentleman who expects your resolution, and\n   therefore, when you please, begin.\n\n   OTT: Please you, master doctor.\n\n   CUT: Please you, good master parson.\n\n   OTT: I would hear the canon-law speak first.\n\n   CUT: It must give place to positive divinity, sir.\n\n   MOR: Nay, good gentlemen, do not throw me into circumstances. Let\n   your comforts arrive quickly at me, those that are. Be swift in\n   affording me my peace, if so I shall hope any. I love not your\n   disputations, or your court-tumults. And that it be not strange to\n   you, I will tell you: My father, in my education, was wont to\n   advise me, that I should always collect and contain my mind, not\n   suffering it to flow loosely; that I should look to what things\n   were necessary to the carriage of my life, and what not; embracing\n   the one and eschewing the other: in short, that I should endear\n   myself to rest, and avoid turmoil: which now is grown to be\n   another nature to me. So that I come not to your public pleadings,\n   or your places of noise; not that I neglect those things that make\n   for the dignity of the commonwealth: but for the mere avoiding\n   of clamours and impertinencies of orators, that know not how to be\n   silent. And for the cause of noise, am I now a suitor to you. You\n   do not know in what a misery I have been exercised this day, what\n   a torrent of evil! my very house turns round with the tumult!

First, you must understand\n   the nature of the word, divorce, a divertendo--\n\n   MOR: No excursions upon words, good doctor, to the question briefly.\n\n   CUT: I answer then, the canon-law affords divorce but in a few\n   cases; and the principal is in the common case, the adulterous\n   case: But there are duodecim impedimenta, twelve impediments, as\n   we call them, all which do not dirimere contractum, but irritum\n   reddere matrimonium, as we say in the canon-law, not take away the\n   bond, but cause a nullity therein.\n\n   MOR: I understood you before: good sir, avoid your impertinency of\n   translation.\n\n   OTT: He cannot open this too much, sir, by your favour.\n\n   MOR: Yet more!\n\n   TRUE: O, you must give the learned men leave, sir.--To your\n   impediments, master Doctor.\n\n   CUT: The first is impedimentum erroris.\n\n   OTT: Of which there are several species.\n\n   CUT: Ay, as error personae.\n\n   OTT: If you contract yourself to one person, thinking her another.\n\n   CUT: Then, error fortunae.\n\n   OTT: If she be a begger, and you thought her rich.\n\n   CUT: Then, error qualitatis.\n\n   OTT: If she prove stubborn or head-strong, that you thought\n   obedient.\n\n   MOR: How! is that, sir, a lawful impediment? One at once, I pray\n   you gentlemen.\n\n   OTT: Ay, ante copulam, but not post copulam, sir.\n\n   CUT: Master Parson says right. Nec post nuptiarum benedictionem.\n   It doth indeed but irrita reddere sponsalia, annul the contract:\n   after marriage it is of no obstancy.\n\n   TRUE: Alas, sir, what a hope are we fallen from by this time!\n\n   CUT: The next is conditio: if you thought her free born, and she\n   prove a bond-woman, there is impediment of estate and condition.\n\n   OTT: Ay, but, master doctor, those servitudes are sublatae now,\n   among us Christians.\n\n   CUT: By your favour, master parson--\n\n   OTT: You shall give me leave, master doctor.\n\n   MOR: Nay, gentlemen, quarrel not in that question; it concerns not\n   my case: pass to the third.\n\n   CUT: Well then, the third is votum: if either party have made a\n   vow of chastity. But that practice, as master parson said of the\n   other, is taken away among us, thanks be to discipline. The fourth\n   is cognatio: if the persons be of kin within the degrees.\n\n   OTT: Ay: do you know what the degrees are, sir?\n\n   MOR: No, nor I care not, sir: they offer me no comfort in the\n   question, I am sure.\n\n   CUT: But there is a branch of this impediment may, which is\n   cognatio spiritualis: if you were her godfather, sir, then the\n   marriage is incestuous.\n\n   OTT: That comment is absurd and superstitious, master doctor: I\n   cannot endure it.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":957,"split":"train"}
