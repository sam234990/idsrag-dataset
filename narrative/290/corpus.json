{"ori_id":"43b69d56cf0ea21266b7fba20c34e00be12d0dea","title":"The Maid of Orleans (play)","context":"The Maid of Orleans (play)\n The play loosely follows the life of Joan of Arc. It contains a prologue introducing the important characters, followed by five acts. Each dramatizes a significant event in Joan's life. Down into Act IV the play departs from history in only secondary details (e.g. by making Joan kill people in battle, and by shifting the reconciliation between the Armagnacs and the Burgundians from 1435 to 1430). Thereafter, however, the plot is entirely free. Joan is about to kill an English knight when, on removing his helmet, she at once falls in love with him, and spares him. Blaming herself for what she regards as a betrayal of her mission, then, when at Reims she is publicly accused of sorcery, she refuses to defend herself, is assumed to be guilty, and dismissed from the French court and army. Captured by the English, she witnesses from her prison cell a battle in which the French are being decisively defeated, breaks her bonds, and dashes out to save the day. She dies as victory is won, her honour and her reputation both restored.\nThe play reflects the new nationalism and militarism of the budding nineteenth century, and also the Kantian ideal of the need to subject emotion to moral principle.\nThe line \"Mit der Dummheit k\u0102\u00a4mpfen G\u0102\u015btter selbst vergebens\" (III, 6; Talbot) translates into English as \"Against stupidity, the gods themselves contend in vain.\" This provided Isaac Asimov with the title of his novel The Gods Themselves.\nThis was the most performed (at least in Germany) of all Schiller's plays down to the Great War. In modern post-war Germany, its militarism is an embarrassment, but the dramatic power of the last two acts keeps the play on the stage.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Maid of Orleans, by Frederich Schiller\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Three young Shepherds,\n   their Suitors.\n\nTHIBAUT.\nAy, my good neighbors! we at least to-day\nAre Frenchmen still, free citizens and lords\nOf the old soil which our forefathers tilled.\nWho knows whom we to-morrow must obey?\nFor England her triumphal banner waves\nFrom every wall: the blooming fields of France\nAre trampled down beneath her chargers' hoofs;\nParis hath yielded to her conquering arms,\nAnd with the ancient crown of Dagobert\nAdorns the scion of a foreign race.\nOur king's descendant, disinherited,\nMust steal in secret through his own domain;\nWhile his first peer and nearest relative\nContends against him in the hostile ranks;\nAy, his unnatural mother leads them on.\nAround us towns and peaceful hamlets burn.\nNear and more near the devastating fire\nRolls toward these vales, which yet repose in peace.\nTherefore, good neighbors, I have now resolved,\nWhile God still grants us safety, to provide\nFor my three daughters; for 'midst war's alarms\nWomen require protection, and true love\nHath power to render lighter every load.\n   [To the first Shepherd.\nCome, Etienne! You seek my Margot's hand.\nFields lying side by side and loving hearts\nPromise a happy union!\n   [To the second.\n            Claude! You're silent,\nAnd my Louison looks upon the ground?\nHow, shall I separate two loving hearts\nBecause you have no wealth to offer me?\nWho now has wealth?

Let our village friends\nBe all assembled for the festival.\n\n   [The two couples retire arm in arm.\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\n\n   THIBAUT, RAIMOND, JOHANNA.\n\nTHIBAUT.\nThy sisters, Joan, will soon be happy brides;\nI see them gladly; they rejoice my age;\nBut thou, my youngest, giv'st me grief and pain.\n\nRAIMOND.\nWhat is the matter? Why upbraid thy child?\n\nTHIBAUT.\nHere is this noble youth, the flower and pride\nOf all our village; he hath fixed on thee\nHis fond affections, and for three long years\nHas wooed thee with respectful tenderness;\nBut thou dost thrust him back with cold reserve.\nNor is there one 'mong all our shepherd youths\nWho e'er can win a gracious smile from thee.\nI see thee blooming in thy youthful prime;\nThy spring it is, the joyous time of hope;\nThy person, like a tender flower, hath now\nDisclosed its beauty, but I vainly wait\nFor love's sweet blossom genially to blow,\nAnd ripen joyously to golden fruit!\nOh, that must ever grieve me, and betrays\nSome sad deficiency in nature's work!\nThe heart I like not which, severe and cold,\nExpands not in the genial years of youth.\n\nRAIMOND.\nForbear, good father! Cease to urge her thus!\nA noble, tender fruit of heavenly growth\nIs my Johanna's love, and time alone\nBringeth the costly to maturity!\nStill she delights to range among the hills,\nAnd fears descending from the wild, free heath,\nTo tarry 'neath the lowly roofs of men,\nWhere dwell the narrow cares of humble life.\nFrom the deep vale, with silent wonder, oft\nI mark her, when, upon a lofty hill\nSurrounded by her flock, erect she stands,\nWith noble port, and bends her earnest gaze\nDown on the small domains of earth. To me\nShe looketh then, as if from other times\nShe came, foreboding things of import high.\n\nTHIBAUT.\n'Tis that precisely which displeases me!\nShe shuns her sisters' gay companionship;\nSeeks out the desert mountains, leaves her couch\nBefore the crowing of the morning cock,\nAnd in the dreadful hour, when men are wont\nConfidingly to seek their fellow-men,\nShe, like the solitary bird, creeps forth,\nAnd in the fearful spirit-realm of night,\nTo yon crossway repairs, and there alone\nHolds secret commune with the mountain wind.\nWherefore this place precisely doth she choose?\nWhy hither always doth she drive her flock?\nFor hours together I have seen her sit\nIn dreamy musing 'neath the Druid tree,\nWhich every happy creature shuns with awe.\nFor 'tis not holy there; an evil spirit\nHath since the fearful pagan days of old\nBeneath its branches fixed his dread abode.\nThe oldest of our villagers relate\nStrange tales of horror of the Druid tree;\nMysterious voices of unearthly sound\nFrom its unhallowed shade oft meet the ear.\nMyself, when in the gloomy twilight hour\nMy path once chanced to lead me near this tree,\nBeheld a spectral figure sitting there,\nWhich slowly from its long and ample robe\nStretched forth its withered hand, and beckoned me.\nBut on I went with speed, nor looked behind,\nAnd to the care of God consigned my soul.\n\nRAIMOND (pointing to the image of the Virgin).\nYon holy image of the Virgin blest,\nWhose presence heavenly peace diffuseth round,\nNot Satan's work, leadeth thy daughter here.\n\nTHIBAUT.\nNo! not in vain hath it in fearful dreams\nAnd apparitions strange revealed itself.\nFor three successive nights I have beheld\nJohanna sitting on the throne at Rheims,\nA sparkling diadem of seven stars\nUpon her brow, the sceptre in her hand,\nFrom which three lilies sprung, and I, her sire,\nWith her two sisters, and the noble peers,\nThe earls, archbishops, and the king himself,\nBowed down before her. In my humble home\nHow could this splendor enter my poor brain?\nOh, 'tis the prelude to some fearful fall!\nThis warning dream, in pictured show, reveals\nThe vain and sinful longing of her heart.\nShe looks with shame upon her lowly birth.\nBecause with richer beauty God hath graced\nHer form, and dowered her with wondrous gifts\nAbove the other maidens of this vale,\nShe in her heart indulges sinful pride,\nAnd pride it is through which the angels fell,\nBy which the fiend of hell seduces man.\n\nRAIMOND.\nWho cherishes a purer, humbler mind\nThan doth thy pious daughter? Does she not\nWith cheerful spirit work her sisters' will?\nShe is more highly gifted far than they,\nYet, like a servant maiden, it is she\nWho silently performs the humblest tasks.\nBeneath her guiding hands prosperity\nAttendeth still thy harvest and thy flocks;\nAnd around all she does there ceaseless flows\nA blessing, rare and unaccountable.\n\nTHIBAUT.\nAh truly! Unaccountable indeed!\nSad horror at this blessing seizes me!\nBut now no more; henceforth I will be silent.\nShall I accuse my own beloved child?\nI can do naught but warn and pray for her.\nYet warn I must. Oh, shun the Druid tree!\nStay not alone, and in the midnight hour\nBreak not the ground for roots, no drinks prepare,\nNo characters inscribe upon the sand!\n'Tis easy to unlock the realm of spirits;\nListening each sound, beneath a film of earth\nThey lay in wait, ready to rush aloft.\nStay not alone, for in the wilderness\nThe prince of darkness tempted e'en the Lord.\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\n\n   THIBAUT, RAIMOND, JOHANNA.\n   BERTRAND enters, a helmet in his hand.\n\nRAIMOND.\nHush! here is Bertrand coming back from town;\nWhat bears he in his hand?\n\nBERTRAND.\n              You look at me\nWith wondering gaze; no doubt you are surprised\nTo see this martial helm!\n\nTHIBAUT.\n              We are indeed!\nCome, tell us how you come by it? Why bring\nThis fearful omen to our peaceful vale?\n\n   [JOHANNA, who has remained indifferent during the two\n   previous scenes, becomes attentive, and steps nearer.\n\nBERTRAND.\nI scarce can tell you how I came by it.\nI had procured some tools at Vaucouleurs;\nA crowd was gathered in the market-place,\nFor fugitives were just arrived in haste\nFrom Orleans, bringing most disastrous news.\nIn tumult all the town together flocked,\nAnd as I forced a passage through the crowds,\nA brown Bohemian woman, with this helm,\nApproached me, eyed me narrowly, and said:\n\"Fellow, you seek a helm; I know it well.\nTake this one! For a trifle it is yours.\"\n\"Go with it to the soldiers,\" I replied,\n\"I am a husbandman, and want no helm.\"\nShe would not cease, however, and went on:\n\"None knoweth if he may not want a helm.\nA roof of metal for the Head just now\nIs of more value than a house of stone.\"\nThus she pursued me closely through the streets,\nStill offering the helm, which I refused.\nI marked it well, and saw that it was bright,\nAnd fair and worthy of a knightly head;\nAnd when in doubt I weighed it in my hand,\nThe strangeness of the incident revolving,\nThe woman disappeared, for suddenly\nThe rushing crowd had carried her away.\nAnd I was left the helmet in my hand.\n\nJOHANNA (attempting eagerly to seize it).\nGive me the helmet!\n\nBERTRAND.\n           Why, what boots it you?\nIt is not suited to a maiden's head.\n\nJOHANNA (seizing it from him).\nMine is the helmet--it belongs to me!\n\nTHIBAUT.\nWhat whim is this?\n\nRAIMOND.\n          Nay, let her have her way!\nThis warlike ornament becomes her well,\nFor in her bosom beats a manly heart.\nRemember how she once subdued the wolf,\nThe savage monster which destroyed our herds,\nAnd filled the neighb'ring shepherds with dismay.\nShe all alone--the lion-hearted maid\nFought with the wolf, and from him snatched the lamb\nWhich he was bearing in his bloody jaws.\nHow brave soe'er the head this helm adorned,\nIt cannot grace a worthier one than hers!\n\nTHIBAUT (to BERTRAND).\nRelate what new disasters have occurred.\nWhat tidings brought the fugitives?\n\nBERTRAND.\n                   May God\nHave pity on our land, and save the king!\nIn two great battles we have lost the day;\nOur foes are stationed in the heart of France,\nFar as the river Loire our lands are theirs--\nNow their whole force they have combined, and lay\nClose siege to Orleans.\n\nTHIBAUT.\n             God protect the king!\n\nBERTRAND.\nArtillery is brought from every side,\nAnd as the dusky squadrons of the bees\nSwarm round the hive upon a summer day,\nAs clouds of locusts from the sultry air\nDescend and shroud the country round for miles,\nSo doth the cloud of war, o'er Orleans' fields,\nPour forth its many-nationed multitudes,\nWhose varied speech, in wild confusion blent,\nWith strange and hollow murmurs fill the air.\nFor Burgundy, the mighty potentate,\nConducts his motley host; the Hennegarians,\nThe men of Liege and of Luxemburg,\nThe people of Namur, and those who dwell\nIn fair Brabant; the wealthy men of Ghent,\nWho boast their velvets, and their costly silks;\nThe Zealanders, whose cleanly towns appear\nEmerging from the ocean; Hollanders\nWho milk the lowing herds; men from Utrecht,\nAnd even from West Friesland's distant realm,\nWho look towards the ice-pole--all combine,\nBeneath the banner of the powerful duke,\nTogether to accomplish Orleans' fall.\n\nTHIBAUT.\nOh, the unblest, the lamentable strife,\nWhich turns the arms of France against itself!\n\nBERTRAND.\nE'en she, the mother-queen, proud Isabel\nBavaria's haughty princess--may be seen,\nArrayed in armor, riding through the camp;\nWith poisonous words of irony she fires\nThe hostile troops to fury 'gainst her son,\nWhom she hath clasped to her maternal breast.\n\nTHIBAUT.\nA curse upon her, and may God prepare\nFor her a death like haughty Jezebel's!\n\nBERTRAND.\nThe fearful Salisbury conducts the siege,\nThe town-destroyer; with him Lionel,\nThe brother of the lion; Talbot, too,\nWho, with his murd'rous weapon, moweth down\nThe people in the battle: they have sworn,\nWith ruthless insolence to doom to shame\nThe hapless maidens, and to sacrifice\nAll who the sword have wielded, with the sword.\nFour lofty watch-towers, to o'ertop the town,\nThey have upreared; Earl Salisbury from on high\nCasteth abroad his cruel, murd'rous glance,\nAnd marks the rapid wanderers in the streets.\nThousands of cannon-balls, of pond'rous weight,\nAre hurled into the city. Churches lie\nIn ruined heaps, and Notre Dame's royal tower\nBegins at length to bow its lofty head.\nThey also have formed powder-vaults below,\nAnd thus, above a subterranean hell,\nThe timid city every hour expects,\n'Midst crashing thunder, to break forth in flames.\n\n   [JOHANNA listens with close attention, and places\n   the helmet on her head.\n\nTHIBAUT.\nBut where were then our heroes? Where the swords\nOf Saintrailles, and La Hire, and brave Dunois,\nOf France the bulwark, that the haughty foe\nWith such impetuous force thus onward rushed?\nWhere is the king? Can he supinely see\nHis kingdom's peril and his cities' fall?\n\nBERTRAND.\nThe king at Chinon holds his court; he lacks\nSoldiers to keep the field. Of what avail\nThe leader's courage, and the hero's arm,\nWhen pallid fear doth paralyze the host?\nA sudden panic, as if sent from God,\nUnnerves the courage of the bravest men.\nIn vain the summons of the king resounds\nAs when the howling of the wolf is heard,\nThe sheep in terror gather side by side,\nSo Frenchmen, careless of their ancient fame,\nSeek only now the shelter of the towns.\nOne knight alone, I have been told, has brought\nA feeble company, and joins the king\nWith sixteen banners.\n\nJOHANNA (quickly).\n            What's the hero's name?\n\nBERTRAND.\n'Tis Baudricour. But much I fear the knight\nWill not be able to elude the foe,\nWho track him closely with too numerous hosts.\n\nJOHANNA.\nWhere halts the knight? Pray tell me, if you know.\n\nBERTRAND.\nAbout a one day's march from Vaucouleurs.\n\nTHIBAUT (to JOHANNA).\nWhy, what is that to thee? Thou dost inquire\nConcerning matters which become thee not.\n\nBERTRAND.\nThe foe being now so strong, and from the king\nNo safety to be hoped, at Vaucouleurs\nThey have with unanimity resolved\nTo yield them to the Duke of Burgundy.\nThus we avoid the foreign yoke, and still\nContinue by our ancient royal line;\nAy, to the ancient crown we may fall back\nShould France and Burgundy be reconciled.\n\nJOHANNA (as if inspired).\nSpeak not of treaty! Speak not of surrender!\nThe savior comes, he arms him for the fight.\nThe fortunes of the foe before the walls\nOf Orleans shall be wrecked! His hour is come,\nHe now is ready for the reaper's hand,\nAnd with her sickle will the maid appear,\nAnd mow to earth the harvest of his pride.\nShe from the heavens will tear his glory down,\nWhich he had hung aloft among the stars;\nDespair not! Fly not! for ere yonder corn\nAssumes its golden hue, or ere the moon\nDisplays her perfect orb, no English horse\nShall drink the rolling waters of the Loire.\n\nBERTRAND.\nAlas! no miracle will happen now!\n\nJOHANNA.\nYes, there shall yet be one--a snow-white dove\nShall fly, and with the eagle's boldness, tear\nThe birds of prey which rend her fatherland.\nShe shall o'erthrow this haughty Burgundy,\nBetrayer of the kingdom; Talbot, too,\nThe hundred-handed, heaven-defying scourge;\nThis Salisbury, who violates our fanes,\nAnd all these island robbers shall she drive\nBefore her like a flock of timid lambs.\nThe Lord will be with her, the God of battle;\nA weak and trembling creature he will choose,\nAnd through a tender maid proclaim his power,\nFor he is the Almighty!\n\nTHIBAULT.\n             What strange power\nHath seized the maiden?\n\nRAIMOND.\n             Doubtless 'tis the helmet\nWhich doth inspire her with such martial thoughts.\nLook at your daughter. Mark her flashing eye,\nHer glowing cheek, which kindles as with fire.\n\nJOHANNA.\nThis realm shall fall! This ancient land of fame,\nThe fairest that, in his majestic course,\nThe eternal sun surveys--this paradise,\nWhich, as the apple of his eye, God loves--\nEndure the fetters of a foreign yoke?\nHere were the heathen scattered, and the cross\nAnd holy image first were planted here;\nHere rest St. Louis' ashes, and from hence\nThe troops went forth who set Jerusalem free.\n\nBERTRAND (in astonishment).\nHark how she speaks! Why, whence can she obtain\nThis glorious revelation? Father Arc!\nA wondrous daughter God hath given you!\n\nJOHANNA.\nWe shall no longer serve a native prince!\nThe king, who never dies, shall pass away--\nThe guardian of the sacred plough, who fills\nThe earth with plenty, who protects our herds,\nWho frees the bondmen from captivity,\nWho gathers all his cities round his throne--\nWho aids the helpless, and appals the base,\nWho envies no one, for he reigns supreme;\nWho is a mortal, yet an angel too,\nDispensing mercy on the hostile earth.\nFor the king's throne, which glitters o'er with gold,\nAffords a shelter for the destitute;\nPower and compassion meet together there,\nThe guilty tremble, but the just draw near,\nAnd with the guardian lion fearless sport!\nThe stranger king, who cometh from afar,\nWhose fathers' sacred ashes do not lie\nInterred among us; can he love our land?\nWho was not young among our youth, whose heart\nRespondeth not to our familiar words,\nCan he be as a father to our sons?\n\nTHIBAUT.\nGod save the king and France! We're peaceful folk,\nWho neither wield the sword, nor rein the steed.\n--Let us await the king whom victory crowns;\nThe fate of battle is the voice of God.\nHe is our lord who crowns himself at Rheims,\nAnd on his head receives the holy oil.\n--Come, now to work! come! and let every one\nThink only of the duty of the hour!\nLet the earth's great ones for the earth contend,\nUntroubled we may view the desolation,\nFor steadfast stand the acres which we till.\nThe flames consume our villages, our corn\nIs trampled 'neath the tread of warlike steeds;\nWith the new spring new harvests reappear,\nAnd our light huts are quickly reared again!\n\n   [They all retire except the maiden.\n\n\n\nSCENE IV.\n\nJOHANNA (alone).\n\nFarewell ye mountains, ye beloved glades,\nYe lone and peaceful valleys, fare ye well!\nThrough you Johanna never more may stray!\nFor, ay, Johanna bids you now farewell.\nYe meads which I have watered, and ye trees\nWhich I have planted, still in beauty bloom!\nFarewell ye grottos, and ye crystal springs!\nSweet echo, vocal spirit of the vale.\nWho sang'st responsive to my simple strain,\nJohanna goes, and ne'er returns again.\n\nYe scenes where all my tranquil joys\nI knew, Forever now I leave you far behind!\nPoor foldless lambs, no shepherd now have you!\nO'er the wide heath stray henceforth unconfined!\nFor I to danger's field, of crimson hue,\nAm summoned hence another flock to find.\nSuch is to me the spirit's high behest;\nNo earthly, vain ambition fires my breast.\n\nFor who in glory did on Horeb's height\nDescend to Moses in the bush of flame,\nAnd bade him go and stand in Pharaoh's sight--\nWho once to Israel's pious shepherd came,\nAnd sent him forth, his champion in the fight,--\nWho aye hath loved the lowly shepherd train,--\nHe, from these leafy boughs, thus spake to me,\n\"Go forth! Thou shalt on earth my witness be.\n\n\"Thou in rude armor must thy limbs invest,\nA plate of steel upon thy bosom wear;\nVain earthly love may never stir thy breast,\nNor passion's sinful glow be kindled there.\nNe'er with the bride-wreath shall thy locks be dressed,\nNor on thy bosom bloom an infant fair;\nBut war's triumphant glory shall be thine;\nThy martial fame all women's shall outshine.\n\n\"For when in fight the stoutest hearts despair,\nWhen direful ruin threatens France, forlorn,\nThen thou aloft my oriflamme shalt bear,\nAnd swiftly as the reaper mows the corn,\nThou shalt lay low the haughty conqueror;\nHis fortune's wheel thou rapidly shalt turn,\nTo Gaul's heroic sons deliverance bring,\nRelieve beleaguered Rheims, and crown thy king!\"\n\nThe heavenly spirit promised me a sign;\nHe sends the helmet, it hath come from him.\nIts iron filleth me with strength divine,\nI feel the courage of the cherubim;\nAs with the rushing of a mighty wind\nIt drives me forth to join the battles din;\nThe clanging trumpets sound, the chargers rear,\nAnd the loud war-cry thunders in mine ear.\n\n             [She goes out.\n\n\n\n\nACT I.\n\nSCENE I.\n\n   The royal residence at Chinon.\n   DUNOIS and DUCHATEL.\n\nDUNOIS.\nNo longer I'll endure it.

Do words\nWith dread inspire thee? 'Tis a coward's fear,\nAnd the betrayer of an evil cause.\n\nJOHANNA.\n'Tis not imperious necessity\nWhich throws us at thy feet!

Oh, tell me that he may;\nComplete thy merit. Void the reconcilement\nThat frees not the whole heart. A drop of hate\nRemaining in the cup of joy converts\nThe blessed draught to poison.

Shall we mount up\nUpon the platform, or press through the crowd,\nThat we may nothing lose of the procession?\n\nETIENNE.\nIt is not to be thought of.

Then two marshals with their staves;\n   the DUKE of BURGUNDY, bearing the sword; DUNOIS with the sceptre,\n   other nobles with the regalia; others with sacrificial offerings.\n   Behind these, KNIGHTS with the ornaments of their order; choristers\n   with incense; two BISHOPS with the ampulla; the ARCHBISHOP with the\n   crucifix. JOHANNA follows, with her banner, she walks with downcast\n   head and wavering steps; her sisters, on beholding her, express\n   their astonishment and joy.

How came I here?\nNo, I have never quitted Dom Remi!\nConfess it to me, and rejoice my heart.\n\nLOUISON.\nWe are at Rheims.

Upon a\n   signal from the KING, all the banners are gently placed\n   over her, so that she is entirely concealed by them.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Maid of Orleans, by Frederich Schiller\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MAID OF ORLEANS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 6792.txt or 6792.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/6\/7\/9\/6792\/\n\nProduced by Tapio Riikonen and David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":290,"split":"train"}
