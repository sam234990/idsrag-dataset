They are Herrick, a failed English businessman; Davis, an American sea captain disgraced by the loss of his last ship; and Huish, a dishonest Cockney of various employments.\nOne day an off-course schooner carrying a cargo of champagne from San Francisco to Sydney arrives in port, its officers having been killed by smallpox. With no-one else willing to risk infection, the U.S. consul employs Davis to take over the ship for the remainder of its voyage. Davis brings the other two men, along with a plan to steal the ship and navigate it to Peru, where they will sell the cargo and vessel and disappear with the money.\nOnce at sea, Davis and Huish start drinking the cargo and spend almost all of their time intoxicated. Herrick, whose conscience is severely troubled by the plan but feels he has no other way to escape poverty, is left alone to manage the ship and three native crew members, despite having no seafaring experience.\nSeveral days later the would-be thieves discover they have been victims of a fraud: most of the cargo is not champagne but merely bottles of water. Evidently the shipper and the previous captain had intended to sink the ship deliberately and claim the full value of the \"champagne\" on insurance.\nNow sober, Davis discovers that his rushed preparations and drunkenness leave the ship with insufficient food to reach Peru. The only port they can reach without starving is Papeete, where they would surely be imprisoned for their actions.\nThey sight an unknown island, where they discover an upper-class Englishman named Attwater. Attwater, a devout Christian, has been harvesting pearls here for many years with the help of several dozen native workers, all except four of whom have recently also died of smallpox.\nThe three men hatch a new plan to kill Attwater and take his pearls, but Herrick's guilt-stricken demeanour and Huish's drunken ramblings soon betray them. Attwater and his servants force them back onto the ship at gunpoint. Unable to live with himself, Herrick jumps overboard and tries to drown himself. Failing even in this, he swims to the shore and throws himself on Attwater's mercy.\nThe next day, Huish proposes a final plan which shocks even the unscrupulous Davis: they will go to meet Attwater under a flag of truce, and Huish will disable him by throwing acid in his face. Attwater is suspicious, realises what is going on, and forces Huish to fatally spread the vitriol on himself. Attwater threatens to kill Davis as well, but forgives him and tells him, \"Go, and sin no more.\"\nTwo weeks later, the surviving men prepare to leave the island as Attwater's own ship approaches. Davis is now repentant and fervently religious to an almost crazed degree, and he urges the atheist Herrick to join him in his faith.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Ebb-Tide, by \nRobert Louis Stevenson and Lloyde Osbourne\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

NIGHT ON THE BEACH\n\nThroughout the island world of the Pacific, scattered men of many\nEuropean races and from almost every grade of society carry activity and\ndisseminate disease. Some prosper, some vegetate. Some have mounted the\nsteps of thrones and owned islands and navies. Others again must marry\nfor a livelihood; a strapping, merry, chocolate-coloured dame supports\nthem in sheer idleness; and, dressed like natives, but still retaining\nsome foreign element of gait or attitude, still perhaps with some relic\n(such as a single eye-glass) of the officer and gentleman, they sprawl\nin palm-leaf verandahs and entertain an island audience with memoirs of\nthe music-hall. And there are still others, less pliable, less capable,\nless fortunate, perhaps less base, who continue, even in these isles of\nplenty, to lack bread.\n\nAt the far end of the town of Papeete, three such men were seated on the\nbeach under a purao tree.\n\nIt was late. Long ago the band had broken up and marched musically home,\na motley troop of men and women, merchant clerks and navy officers,\ndancing in its wake, arms about waist and crowned with garlands. Long\nago darkness and silence had gone from house to house about the tiny\npagan city. Only the street lamps shone on, making a glow-worm halo in\nthe umbrageous alleys or drawing a tremulous image on the waters of the\nport. A sound of snoring ran among the piles of lumber by the Government\npier. It was wafted ashore from the graceful clipper-bottomed schooners,\nwhere they lay moored close in like dinghies, and their crews were\nstretched upon the deck under the open sky or huddled in a rude tent\namidst the disorder of merchandise.\n\nBut the men under the purao had no thought of sleep. The same\ntemperature in England would have passed without remark in summer; but\nit was bitter cold for the South Seas. Inanimate nature knew it, and the\nbottle of cocoanut oil stood frozen in every bird-cage house about\nthe island; and the men knew it, and shivered. They wore flimsy cotton\nclothes, the same they had sweated in by day and run the gauntlet of the\ntropic showers; and to complete their evil case, they had no breakfast\nto mention, less dinner, and no supper at all.\n\nIn the telling South Sea phrase, these three men were ON THE BEACH.\nCommon calamity had brought them acquainted, as the three most miserable\nEnglish-speaking creatures in Tahiti; and beyond their misery, they knew\nnext to nothing of each other, not even their true names. For each had\nmade a long apprenticeship in going downward; and each, at some stage of\nthe descent, had been shamed into the adoption of an alias. And yet not\none of them had figured in a court of justice; two were men of kindly\nvirtues; and one, as he sat and shivered under the purao, had a tattered\nVirgil in his pocket.\n\nCertainly, if money could have been raised upon the book, Robert Herrick\nwould long ago have sacrificed that last possession; but the demand\nfor literature, which is so marked a feature in some parts of the South\nSeas, extends not so far as the dead tongues; and the Virgil, which he\ncould not exchange against a meal, had often consoled him in his hunger.\nHe would study it, as he lay with tightened belt on the floor of the\nold calaboose, seeking favourite passages and finding new ones only less\nbeautiful because they lacked the consecration of remembrance. Or he\nwould pause on random country walks; sit on the path side, gazing over\nthe sea on the mountains of Eimeo; and dip into the Aeneid, seeking\nsortes. And if the oracle (as is the way of oracles) replied with no\nvery certain nor encouraging voice, visions of England at least\nwould throng upon the exile's memory: the busy schoolroom, the green\nplaying-fields, holidays at home, and the perennial roar of London, and\nthe fireside, and the white head of his father. For it is the destiny of\nthose grave, restrained and classic writers, with whom we make enforced\nand often painful acquaintanceship at school, to pass into the blood and\nbecome native in the memory; so that a phrase of Virgil speaks not so\nmuch of Mantua or Augustus, but of English places and the student's own\nirrevocable youth.\n\nRobert Herrick was the son of an intelligent, active, and ambitious man,\nsmall partner in a considerable London house. Hopes were conceived\nof the boy; he was sent to a good school, gained there an Oxford\nscholarship, and proceeded in course to the Western University. With all\nhis talent and taste (and he had much of both) Robert was deficient\nin consistency and intellectual manhood, wandered in bypaths of study,\nworked at music or at metaphysics when he should have been at Greek, and\ntook at last a paltry degree. Almost at the same time, the London house\nwas disastrously wound up; Mr Herrick must begin the world again as\na clerk in a strange office, and Robert relinquish his ambitions and\naccept with gratitude a career that he detested and despised. He had\nno head for figures, no interest in affairs, detested the constraint of\nhours, and despised the aims and the success of merchants. To grow rich\nwas none of his ambitions; rather to do well. A worse or a more bold\nyoung man would have refused the destiny; perhaps tried his future with\nhis pen; perhaps enlisted. Robert, more prudent, possibly more timid,\nconsented to embrace that way of life in which he could most readily\nassist his family. But he did so with a mind divided; fled the\nneighbourhood of former comrades; and chose, out of several positions\nplaced at his disposal, a clerkship in New York.\n\nHis career thenceforth was one of unbroken shame. He did not drink,\nhe was exactly honest, he was never rude to his employers, yet was\neverywhere discharged. Bringing no interest to his duties, he brought\nno attention; his day was a tissue of things neglected and things done\namiss; and from place to place and from town to town, he carried the\ncharacter of one thoroughly incompetent. No man can bear the word\napplied to him without some flush of colour, as indeed there is\nnone other that so emphatically slams in a man's face the door\nof self-respect. And to Herrick, who was conscious of talents and\nacquirements, who looked down upon those humble duties in which he was\nfound wanting, the pain was the more exquisite. Early in his fall, he\nhad ceased to be able to make remittances; shortly after, having nothing\nbut failure to communicate, he ceased writing home; and about a year\nbefore this tale begins, turned suddenly upon the streets of San\nFrancisco by a vulgar and infuriated German Jew, he had broken the last\nbonds of self-respect, and upon a sudden Impulse, changed his name and\ninvested his last dollar in a passage on the mail brigantine, the City\nof Papeete. With what expectation he had trimmed his flight for the\nSouth Seas, Herrick perhaps scarcely knew. Doubtless there were fortunes\nto be made in pearl and copra; doubtless others not more gifted than\nhimself had climbed in the island world to be queen's consorts and\nking's ministers. But if Herrick had gone there with any manful purpose,\nhe would have kept his father's name; the alias betrayed his moral\nbankruptcy; he had struck his flag; he entertained no hope to reinstate\nhimself or help his straitened family; and he came to the islands (where\nhe knew the climate to be soft, bread cheap, and manners easy) a skulker\nfrom life's battle and his own immediate duty. Failure, he had said, was\nhis portion; let it be a pleasant failure.\n\nIt is fortunately not enough to say 'I will be base.' Herrick continued\nin the islands his career of failure; but in the new scene and under the\nnew name, he suffered no less sharply than before. A place was got, it\nwas lost in the old style; from the long-suffering of the keepers of\nrestaurants he fell to more open charity upon the wayside; as time went\non, good nature became weary, and after a repulse or two, Herrick became\nshy. There were women enough who would have supported a far worse and a\nfar uglier man; Herrick never met or never knew them: or if he did both,\nsome manlier feeling would revolt, and he preferred starvation. Drenched\nwith rains, broiling by day, shivering by night, a disused and ruinous\nprison for a bedroom, his diet begged or pilfered out of rubbish heaps,\nhis associates two creatures equally outcast with himself, he had\ndrained for months the cup of penitence. He had known what it was to\nbe resigned, what it was to break forth in a childish fury of rebellion\nagainst fate, and what it was to sink into the coma of despair. The time\nhad changed him. He told himself no longer tales of an easy and perhaps\nagreeable declension; he read his nature otherwise; he had proved\nhimself incapable of rising, and he now learned by experience that he\ncould not stoop to fall. Something that was scarcely pride or strength,\nthat was perhaps only refinement, withheld him from capitulation; but\nhe looked on upon his own misfortune with a growing rage, and sometimes\nwondered at his patience.\n\nIt was now the fourth month completed, and still there was no change\nor sign of change. The moon, racing through a world of flying clouds\nof every size and shape and density, some black as ink stains, some\ndelicate as lawn, threw the marvel of her Southern brightness over the\nsame lovely and detested scene: the island mountains crowned with the\nperennial island cloud, the embowered city studded with rare lamps, the\nmasts in the harbour, the smooth mirror of the lagoon, and the mole of\nthe barrier reef on which the breakers whitened. The moon shone too,\nwith bull's-eye sweeps, on his companions; on the stalwart frame of the\nAmerican who called himself Brown, and was known to be a master\nmariner in some disgrace; and on the dwarfish person, the pale eyes\nand toothless smile of a vulgar and bad-hearted cockney clerk. Here was\nsociety for Robert Herrick! The Yankee skipper was a man at least: he\nhad sterling qualities of tenderness and resolution; he was one whose\nhand you could take without a blush. But there was no redeeming grace\nabout the other, who called himself sometimes Hay and sometimes Tomkins,\nand laughed at the discrepancy; who had been employed in every store in\nPapeete, for the creature was able in his way; who had been discharged\nfrom each in turn, for he was wholly vile; who had alienated all his old\nemployers so that they passed him in the street as if he were a dog, and\nall his old comrades so that they shunned him as they would a creditor.\n\nNot long before, a ship from Peru had brought an influenza, and it now\nraged in the island, and particularly in Papeete. From all round the\npurao arose and fell a dismal sound of men coughing, and strangling\nas they coughed. The sick natives, with the islander's impatience of a\ntouch of fever, had crawled from their houses to be cool and, squatting\non the shore or on the beached canoes, painfully expected the new day.\nEven as the crowing of cocks goes about the country in the night from\nfarm to farm, accesses of coughing arose, and spread, and died in\nthe distance, and sprang up again. Each miserable shiverer caught the\nsuggestion from his neighbour, was torn for some minutes by that cruel\necstasy, and left spent and without voice or courage when it passed. If\na man had pity to spend, Papeete beach, in that cold night and in that\ninfected season, was a place to spend it on. And of all the sufferers,\nperhaps the least deserving, but surely the most pitiable, was the\nLondon clerk. He was used to another life, to houses, beds, nursing,\nand the dainties of the sickroom; he lay there now, in the cold open,\nexposed to the gusting of the wind, and with an empty belly. He was\nbesides infirm; the disease shook him to the vitals; and his companions\nwatched his endurance with surprise. A profound commiseration filled\nthem, and contended with and conquered their abhorrence. The disgust\nattendant on so ugly a sickness magnified this dislike; at the same\ntime, and with more than compensating strength, shame for a sentiment so\ninhuman bound them the more straitly to his service; and even the evil\nthey knew of him swelled their solicitude, for the thought of death is\nalways the least supportable when it draws near to the merely sensual\nand selfish. Sometimes they held him up; sometimes, with mistaken\nhelpfulness, they beat him between the shoulders; and when the poor\nwretch lay back ghastly and spent after a paroxysm of coughing, they\nwould sometimes peer into his face, doubtfully exploring it for any\nmark of life. There is no one but has some virtue: that of the clerk was\ncourage; and he would make haste to reassure them in a pleasantry not\nalways decent.\n\n'I'm all right, pals,' he gasped once: 'this is the thing to strengthen\nthe muscles of the larynx.'\n\n'Well, you take the cake!' cried the captain.\n\n'O, I'm good plucked enough,' pursued the sufferer with a broken\nutterance. 'But it do seem bloomin' hard to me, that I should be the\nonly party down with this form of vice, and the only one to do the funny\nbusiness. I think one of you other parties might wake up. Tell a fellow\nsomething.'\n\n'The trouble is we've nothing to tell, my son,' returned the captain.\n\n'I'll tell you, if you like, what I was thinking,' said Herrick.\n\n'Tell us anything,' said the clerk, 'I only want to be reminded that I\nain't dead.'\n\nHerrick took up his parable, lying on his face and speaking slowly and\nscarce above his breath, not like a man who has anything to say, but\nlike one talking against time.\n\n'Well, I was thinking this,' he began: 'I was thinking I lay on Papeete\nbeach one night--all moon and squalls and fellows coughing--and I was\ncold and hungry, and down in the mouth, and was about ninety years of\nage, and had spent two hundred and twenty of them on Papeete beach. And\nI was thinking I wished I had a ring to rub, or had a fairy godmother,\nor could raise Beelzebub. And I was trying to remember how you did it. I\nknew you made a ring of skulls, for I had seen that in the Freischutz:\nand that you took off your coat and turned up your sleeves, for I had\nseen Formes do that when he was playing Kaspar, and you could see (by\nthe way he went about it) it was a business he had studied; and that you\nought to have something to kick up a smoke and a bad smell, I dare say\na cigar might do, and that you ought to say the Lord's Prayer backwards.\nWell, I wondered if I could do that; it seemed rather a feat, you see.\nAnd then I wondered if I would say it forward, and I thought I did.\nWell, no sooner had I got to WORLD WITHOUT END, than I saw a man in a\npariu, and with a mat under his arm, come along the beach from the town.\nHe was rather a hard-favoured old party, and he limped and crippled, and\nall the time he kept coughing. At first I didn't cotton to his looks,\nI thought, and then I got sorry for the old soul because he coughed so\nhard. I remembered that we had some of that cough mixture the American\nconsul gave the captain for Hay. It never did Hay a ha'porth of service,\nbut I thought it might do the old gentleman's business for him, and\nstood up. \"Yorana!\" says I. \"Yorana!\" says he. \"Look here,\" I said,\n\"I've got some first-rate stuff in a bottle; it'll fix your cough,\nsavvy? Harry my and I'll measure you a tablespoonful in the palm of my\nhand, for all our plate is at the bankers.\" So I thought the old party\ncame up, and the nearer he came, the less I took to him. But I had\npassed my word, you see.'\n\n'Wot is this bloomin' drivel?' interrupted the clerk. 'It's like the rot\nthere is in tracts.'\n\n'It's a story; I used to tell them to the kids at home,' said Herrick.\n'If it bores you, I'll drop it.'\n\n'O, cut along!' returned the sick man, irritably. 'It's better than\nnothing.'\n\n'Well,' continued Herrick, 'I had no sooner given him the cough mixture\nthan he seemed to straighten up and change, and I saw he wasn't a\nTahitian after all, but some kind of Arab, and had a long beard on his\nchin. \"One good turn deserves another,\" says he. \"I am a magician out\nof the Arabian Nights, and this mat that I have under my arm is the\noriginal carpet of Mohammed Ben Somebody-or-other. Say the word, and you\ncan have a cruise upon the carpet.\" \"You don't mean to say this is the\nTravelling Carpet?\" I cried. \"You bet I do,\" said he. \"You've been\nto America since last I read the Arabian Nights,\" said I, a little\nsuspicious. \"I should think so,\" said he. \"Been everywhere. A man with a\ncarpet like this isn't going to moulder in a semi-detached villa.\" Well,\nthat struck me as reasonable. \"All right,\" I said; \"and do you mean to\ntell me I can get on that carpet and go straight to London, England?\" I\nsaid, \"London, England,\" captain, because he seemed to have been so long\nin your part of the world. \"In the crack of a whip,\" said he. I\nfigured up the time. What is the difference between Papeete and London,\ncaptain?'\n\n'Taking Greenwich and Point Venus, nine hours, odd minutes and seconds,'\nreplied the mariner.\n\n'Well, that's about what I made it,' resumed Herrick, 'about nine hours.\nCalling this three in the morning, I made out I would drop into London\nabout noon; and the idea tickled me immensely. \"There's only one\nbother,\" I said, \"I haven't a copper cent. It would be a pity to go\nto London and not buy the morning Standard.\" \"O!\" said he, \"you don't\nrealise the conveniences of this carpet. You see this pocket? you've\nonly got to stick your hand in, and you pull it out filled with\nsovereigns.\"\n\n'Double-eagles, wasn't iff inquired the captain.\n\n'That was what it was!' cried Herrick. 'I thought they seemed unusually\nbig, and I remember now I had to go to the money-changers at Charing\nCross and get English silver.'\n\n'O, you went there?' said the clerk. 'Wot did you do? Bet you had a B.\nand S.!'\n\n'Well, you see, it was just as the old boy said--like the cut of a\nwhip,' said Herrick. 'The one minute I was here on the beach at three in\nthe morning, the next I was in front of the Golden Cross at midday.\nAt first I was dazzled, and covered my eyes, and there didn't seem the\nsmallest change; the roar of the Strand and the roar of the reef were\nlike the same: hark to it now, and you can hear the cabs and buses\nrolling and the streets resound! And then at last I could look about,\nand there was the old place, and no mistake! With the statues in\nthe square, and St Martin's-in-the-Fields, and the bobbies, and the\nsparrows, and the hacks; and I can't tell you what I felt like. I felt\nlike crying, I believe, or dancing, or jumping clean over the Nelson\nColumn. I was like a fellow caught up out of Hell and flung down into\nthe dandiest part of Heaven. Then I spotted for a hansom with a spanking\nhorse. \"A shilling for yourself, if you're there in twenty minutes!\"\nsaid I to the jarvey. He went a good pace, though of course it was a\ntrifle to the carpet; and in nineteen minutes and a half I was at the\ndoor.'\n\n'What door?' asked the captain.\n\n'Oh, a house I know of,' returned Herrick.\n\n'But it was a public-house!' cried the clerk--only these were not his\nwords. 'And w'y didn't you take the carpet there instead of trundling in\na growler?'\n\n'I didn't want to startle a quiet street,' said the narrator.\n\n'Bad form. And besides, it was a hansom.'\n\n'Well, and what did you do next?' inquired the captain.\n\n'Oh, I went in,' said Herrick.\n\n'The old folks?' asked the captain.\n\n'That's about it,' said the other, chewing a grass.\n\n'Well, I think you are about the poorest 'and at a yarn!' cried the\nclerk. 'Crikey, it's like Ministering Children! I can tell you there\nwould be more beer and skittles about my little jaunt. I would go and\nhave a B. and S. for luck. Then I would get a big ulster with astrakhan\nfur, and take my cane and do the la-de-la down Piccadilly. Then I would\ngo to a slap-up restaurant, and have green peas, and a bottle of fizz,\nand a chump chop--Oh! and I forgot, I'd 'ave some devilled whitebait\nfirst--and green gooseberry tart, and 'ot coffee, and some of that form\nof vice in big bottles with a seal--Benedictine--that's the bloomin'\nnyme! Then I'd drop into a theatre, and pal on with some chappies,\nand do the dancing rooms and bars, and that, and wouldn't go 'ome\ntill morning, till daylight doth appear. And the next day I'd have\nwater-cresses, 'am, muffin, and fresh butter; wouldn't I just, O my!'\n\nThe clerk was interrupted by a fresh attack of coughing.\n\n'Well, now, I'll tell you what I would do,' said the captain: 'I would\nhave none of your fancy rigs with the man driving from the mizzen\ncross-trees, but a plain fore-and-aft hack cab of the highest registered\ntonnage. First of all, I would bring up at the market and get a turkey\nand a sucking-pig. Then I'd go to a wine merchant's and get a dozen of\nchampagne, and a dozen of some sweet wine, rich and sticky and strong,\nsomething in the port or madeira line, the best in the store. Then I'd\nbear up for a toy-store, and lay out twenty dollars in assorted toys\nfor the piccaninnies; and then to a confectioner's and take in cakes and\npies and fancy bread, and that stuff with the plums in it; and then to\na news-agency and buy all the papers, all the picture ones for the kids,\nand all the story papers for the old girl about the Earl discovering\nhimself to Anna-Mariar and the escape of the Lady Maude from the private\nmadhouse; and then I'd tell the fellow to drive home.'\n\n'There ought to be some syrup for the kids,' suggested Herrick; 'they\nlike syrup.'\n\n'Yes, syrup for the kids, red syrup at that!' said the captain. 'And\nthose things they pull at, and go pop, and have measly poetry inside.\nAnd then I tell you we'd have a thanksgiving day and Christmas tree\ncombined. Great Scott, but I would like to see the kids! I guess they\nwould light right out of the house, when they saw daddy driving up. My\nlittle Adar--'\n\nThe captain stopped sharply.\n\n'Well, keep it up!' said the clerk.\n\n'The damned thing is, I don't know if they ain't starving!' cried the\ncaptain.\n\n'They can't be worse off than we are, and that's one comfort,' returned\nthe clerk. 'I defy the devil to make me worse off.'\n\nIt seemed as if the devil heard him. The light of the moon had been\nsome time cut off and they had talked in darkness. Now there was heard a\nroar, which drew impetuously nearer; the face of the lagoon was seen to\nwhiten; and before they had staggered to their feet, a squall burst in\nrain upon the outcasts. The rage and volume of that avalanche one must\nhave lived in the tropics to conceive; a man panted in its assault, as\nhe might pant under a shower-bath; and the world seemed whelmed in night\nand water.\n\nThey fled, groping for their usual shelter--it might be almost called\ntheir home--in the old calaboose; came drenched into its empty chambers;\nand lay down, three sops of humanity on the cold coral floors, and\npresently, when the squall was overpast, the others could hear in the\ndarkness the chattering of the clerk's teeth.\n\n'I say, you fellows,' he walled, 'for God's sake, lie up and try to warm\nme. I'm blymed if I don't think I'll die else!'\n\nSo the three crept together into one wet mass, and lay until day came,\nshivering and dozing off, and continually re-awakened to wretchedness by\nthe coughing of the clerk.\n\n\n\nChapter 2. MORNING ON THE BEACH--THE THREE LETTERS\n\nThe clouds were all fled, the beauty of the tropic day was spread upon\nPapeete; and the wall of breaking seas upon the reef, and the palms upon\nthe islet, already trembled in the heat. A French man-of-war was going\nout, homeward bound; she lay in the middle distance of the port, an ant\nheap for activity. In the night a schooner had come in, and now lay far\nout, hard by the passage; and the yellow flag, the emblem of pestilence,\nflew on her. From up the coast, a long procession of canoes headed\nround the point and towards the market, bright as a scarf with the\nmany-coloured clothing of the natives and the piles of fruit. But not\neven the beauty and the welcome warmth of the morning, not even these\nnaval movements, so interesting to sailors and to idlers, could engage\nthe attention of the outcasts. They were still cold at heart, their\nmouths sour from the want of steep, their steps rambling from the\nlack of food; and they strung like lame geese along the beach in a\ndisheartened silence. It was towards the town they moved; towards the\ntown whence smoke arose, where happier folk were breakfasting; and as\nthey went, their hungry eyes were upon all sides, but they were only\nscouting for a meal.\n\nA small and dingy schooner lay snug against the quay, with which it was\nconnected by a plank. On the forward deck, under a spot of awning, five\nKanakas who made up the crew, were squatted round a basin of fried feis,\nand drinking coffee from tin mugs.\n\n'Eight bells: knock off for breakfast!' cried the captain with a\nmiserable heartiness. 'Never tried this craft before; positively my\nfirst appearance; guess I'll draw a bumper house.'\n\nHe came close up to where the plank rested on the grassy quay; turned\nhis back upon the schooner, and began to whistle that lively air, 'The\nIrish Washerwoman.' It caught the ears of the Kanaka seamen like a\npreconcerted signal; with one accord they looked up from their meal and\ncrowded to the ship's side, fei in hand and munching as they looked.\nEven as a poor brown Pyrenean bear dances in the streets of English\ntowns under his master's baton; even so, but with how much more\nof spirit and precision, the captain footed it in time to his own\nwhistling, and his long morning shadow capered beyond him on the grass.\nThe Kanakas smiled on the performance; Herrick looked on heavy-eyed,\nhunger for the moment conquering all sense of shame; and a little\nfarther off, but still hard by, the clerk was torn by the seven devils\nof the influenza.\n\nThe captain stopped suddenly, appeared to perceive his audience for the\nfirst time, and represented the part of a man surprised in his private\nhour of pleasure.\n\n'Hello!' said he.\n\nThe Kanakas clapped hands and called upon him to go on.\n\n'No, SIR!' said the captain. 'No eat, no dance. Savvy?'\n\n'Poor old man!' returned one of the crew. 'Him no eat?'\n\n'Lord, no!' said the captain. 'Like-um too much eat. No got.'\n\n'All right. Me got,' said the sailor; 'you tome here. Plenty toffee,\nplenty fei. Nutha man him tome too.'\n\n'I guess we'll drop right in,' observed the captain; and he and his\ncompanions hastened up the plank. They were welcomed on board with the\nshaking of hands; place was made for them about the basin; a sticky\ndemijohn of molasses was added to the feast in honour of company, and\nan accordion brought from the forecastle and significantly laid by the\nperformer's side.\n\n'Ariana,' said he lightly, touching the instrument as he spoke; and\nhe fell to on a long savoury fei, made an end of it, raised his mug of\ncoffee, and nodded across at the spokesman of the crew. 'Here's your\nhealth, old man; you're a credit to the South Pacific,' said he.\n\nWith the unsightly greed of hounds they glutted themselves with the hot\nfood and coffee; and even the clerk revived and the colour deepened in\nhis eyes. The kettle was drained, the basin cleaned; their entertainers,\nwho had waited on their wants throughout with the pleased hospitality of\nPolynesians, made haste to bring forward a dessert of island tobacco and\nrolls of pandanus leaf to serve as paper; and presently all sat about\nthe dishes puffing like Indian Sachems.\n\n'When a man 'as breakfast every day, he don't know what it is,' observed\nthe clerk.\n\n'The next point is dinner,' said Herrick; and then with a passionate\nutterance: 'I wish to God I was a Kanaka!'\n\n'There's one thing sure,' said the captain. 'I'm about desperate, I'd\nrather hang than rot here much longer.' And with the word he took the\naccordion and struck up. 'Home, sweet home.'\n\n'O, drop that!' cried Herrick, 'I can't stand that.'\n\n'No more can I,' said the captain. 'I've got to play something though:\ngot to pay the shot, my son.' And he struck up 'John Brown's Body' in\na fine sweet baritone: 'Dandy Jim of Carolina,' came next; 'Rorin the\nBold,' 'Swing low, Sweet Chariot,' and 'The Beautiful Land' followed.\nThe captain was paying his shot with usury, as he had done many a\ntime before; many a meal had he bought with the same currency from the\nmelodious-minded natives, always, as now, to their delight.\n\nHe was in the middle of 'Fifteen Dollars in the Inside Pocket,' singing\nwith dogged energy, for the task went sore against the grain, when a\nsensation was suddenly to be observed among the crew.\n\n'Tapena Tom harry my,' said the spokesman, pointing.\n\nAnd the three beachcombers, following his indication, saw the figure of\na man in pyjama trousers and a white jumper approaching briskly from the\ntown.\n\n'Captain Tom is coming.'\n\n'That's Tapena Tom, is it?' said the captain, pausing in his music. 'I\ndon't seem to place the brute.'\n\n'We'd better cut,' said the clerk. ''E's no good.'\n\n'Well,' said the musician deliberately, 'one can't most generally always\ntell. I'll try it on, I guess. Music has charms to soothe the savage\nTapena, boys. We might strike it rich; it might amount to iced punch in\nthe cabin.'\n\n'Hiced punch? O my!' said the clerk. 'Give him something 'ot, captain.\n\"Way down the Swannee River\"; try that.'\n\n'No, sir! Looks Scotch,' said the captain; and he struck, for his life,\ninto 'Auld Lang Syne.'\n\nCaptain Tom continued to approach with the same business-like alacrity;\nno change was to be perceived in his bearded face as he came swinging up\nthe plank: he did not even turn his eyes on the performer.\n\n    'We twa hae paidled in the burn\n     Frae morning tide till dine,'\n\nwent the song.\n\nCaptain Tom had a parcel under his arm, which he laid on the house roof,\nand then turning suddenly to the strangers: 'Here, you!' he bellowed,\n'be off out of that!'\n\nThe clerk and Herrick stood not on the order of their going, but fled\nincontinently by the plank. The performer, on the other hand, flung down\nthe instrument and rose to his full height slowly.\n\n'What's that you say?' he said. 'I've half a mind to give you a lesson\nin civility.'\n\n'You set up any more of your gab to me,' returned the Scotsman, 'and\nI'll show ye the wrong side of a jyle. I've heard tell of the three\nof ye. Ye're not long for here, I can tell ye that. The Government has\ntheir eyes upon ye. They make short work of damned beachcombers, I'll\nsay that for the French.'\n\n'You wait till I catch you off your ship!' cried the captain: and\nthen, turning to the crew, 'Good-bye, you fellows!' he said. 'You're\ngentlemen, anyway! The worst nigger among you would look better upon a\nquarter-deck than that filthy Scotchman.'\n\nCaptain Tom scorned to reply; he watched with a hard smile the departure\nof his guests; and as soon as the last foot was off the plank; turned to\nthe hands to work cargo.\n\nThe beachcombers beat their inglorious retreat along the shore; Herrick\nfirst, his face dark with blood, his knees trembling under him with\nthe hysteria of rage. Presently, under the same purao where they had\nshivered the night before, he cast himself down, and groaned aloud, and\nground his face into the sand.\n\n'Don't speak to me, don't speak to me. I can't stand it,' broke from\nhim.\n\nThe other two stood over him perplexed.\n\n'Wot can't he stand now?' said the clerk. ''Asn't he 'ad a meal? I'M\nlickin' my lips.'\n\nHerrick reared up his wild eyes and burning face. 'I can't beg!' he\nscreamed, and again threw himself prone.\n\n'This thing's got to come to an end,' said the captain with an intake of\nthe breath.\n\n'Looks like signs of an end, don't it?' sneered the clerk.\n\n'He's not so far from it, and don't you deceive yourself,' replied the\ncaptain. 'Well,' he added in a livelier voice, 'you fellows hang on\nhere, and I'll go and interview my representative.'\n\nWhereupon he turned on his heel, and set off at a swinging sailor's walk\ntowards Papeete.\n\nIt was some half hour later when he returned. The clerk was dozing with\nhis back against the tree: Herrick still lay where he had flung himself;\nnothing showed whether he slept or waked.\n\n'See, boys!' cried the captain, with that artificial heartiness of his\nwhich was at times so painful, 'here's a new idea.' And he produced note\npaper, stamped envelopes, and pencils, three of each. 'We can all write\nhome by the mail brigantine; the consul says I can come over to his\nplace and ink up the addresses.'\n\n'Well, that's a start, too,' said the clerk. 'I never thought of that.'\n\n'It was that yarning last night about going home that put me up to it,'\nsaid the captain.\n\n'Well, 'and over,' said the clerk. 'I'll 'ave a shy,' and he retired a\nlittle distance to the shade of a canoe.\n\nThe others remained under the purao. Now they would write a word or two,\nnow scribble it out; now they would sit biting at the pencil end and\nstaring seaward; now their eyes would rest on the clerk, where he sat\npropped on the canoe, leering and coughing, his pencil racing glibly on\nthe paper.\n\n'I can't do it,' said Herrick suddenly. 'I haven't got the heart.'\n\n'See here,' said the captain, speaking with unwonted gravity; 'it may be\nhard to write, and to write lies at that; and God knows it is; but it's\nthe square thing. It don't cost anything to say you're well and happy,\nand sorry you can't make a remittance this mail; and if you don't, I'll\ntell you what I think it is--I think it's about the high-water mark of\nbeing a brute beast.'\n\n'It's easy to talk,' said Herrick. 'You don't seem to have written much\nyourself, I notice.'\n\n'What do you bring in me for?' broke from the captain. His voice was\nindeed scarce raised above a whisper, but emotion clanged in it. 'What\ndo you know about me? If you had commanded the finest barque that ever\nsailed from Portland; if you had been drunk in your berth when she\nstruck the breakers in Fourteen Island Group, and hadn't had the wit to\nstay there and drown, but came on deck, and given drunken orders, and\nlost six lives--I could understand your talking then! There,' he said\nmore quietly, 'that's my yarn, and now you know it. It's a pretty one\nfor the father of a family. Five men and a woman murdered. Yes, there\nwas a woman on board, and hadn't no business to be either. Guess I sent\nher to Hell, if there is such a place. I never dared go home again; and\nthe wife and the little ones went to England to her father's place. I\ndon't know what's come to them,' he added, with a bitter shrug.\n\n'Thank you, captain,' said Herrick. 'I never liked you better.'\n\nThey shook hands, short and hard, with eyes averted, tenderness swelling\nin their bosoms.\n\n'Now, boys! to work again at lying!' said the captain.\n\n'I'll give my father up,' returned Herrick with a writhen smile. 'I'll\ntry my sweetheart instead for a change of evils.'\n\nAnd here is what he wrote:\n\n'Emma, I have scratched out the beginning to my father, for I think I\ncan write more easily to you. This is my last farewell to all, the last\nyou will ever hear or see of an unworthy friend and son. I have failed\nin life; I am quite broken down and disgraced. I pass under a false\nname; you will have to tell my father that with all your kindness. It is\nmy own fault. I know, had I chosen, that I might have done well; and yet\nI swear to you I tried to choose. I could not bear that you should think\nI did not try. For I loved you all; you must never doubt me in that,\nyou least of all. I have always unceasingly loved, but what was my love\nworth? and what was I worth? I had not the manhood of a common clerk,\nI could not work to earn you; I have lost you now, and for your sake I\ncould be glad of it. When you first came to my father's house--do you\nremember those days? I want you to--you saw the best of me then, all\nthat was good in me. Do you remember the day I took your hand and would\nnot let it go--and the day on Battersea Bridge, when we were looking at\na barge, and I began to tell you one of my silly stories, and broke off\nto say I loved you? That was the beginning, and now here is the end.\nWhen you have read this letter, you will go round and kiss them all\ngood-bye, my father and mother, and the children, one by one, and poor\nuncle; And tell them all to forget me, and forget me yourself. Turn\nthe key in the door; let no thought of me return; be done with the poor\nghost that pretended he was a man and stole your love. Scorn of myself\ngrinds in me as I write. I should tell you I am well and happy, and want\nfor nothing. I do not exactly make money, or I should send a remittance;\nbut I am well cared for, have friends, live in a beautiful place and\nclimate, such as we have dreamed of together, and no pity need be wasted\non me. In such places, you understand, it is easy to live, and live\nwell, but often hard to make sixpence in money. Explain this to my\nfather, he will understand. I have no more to say; only linger, going\nout, like an unwilling guest. God in heaven bless you. Think of me to\nthe last, here, on a bright beach, the sky and sea immoderately blue,\nand the great breakers roaring outside on a barrier reef, where a little\nisle sits green with palms. I am well and strong. It is a more pleasant\nway to die than if you were crowding about me on a sick-bed. And yet I\nam dying. This is my last kiss. Forgive, forget the unworthy.'\n\nSo far he had written, his paper was all filled, when there returned a\nmemory of evenings at the piano, and that song, the masterpiece of love,\nin which so many have found the expression of their dearest thoughts.\n'Einst, O wunder!' he added. More was not required; he knew that in his\nlove's heart the context would spring up, escorted with fair images and\nharmony; of how all through life her name should tremble in his ears,\nher name be everywhere repeated in the sounds of nature; and when death\ncame, and he lay dissolved, her memory lingered and thrilled among his\nelements.\n\n    'Once, O wonder! once from the ashes of my heart\n     Arose a blossom--'\n\nHerrick and the captain finished their letters about the same time; each\nwas breathing deep, and their eyes met and were averted as they closed\nthe envelopes.\n\n'Sorry I write so big,' said the captain gruffly. 'Came all of a rush,\nwhen it did come.'\n\n'Same here,' said Herrick. 'I could have done with a ream when I got\nstarted; but it's long enough for all the good I had to say.'\n\nThey were still at the addresses when the clerk strolled up, smirking\nand twirling his envelope, like a man well pleased. He looked over\nHerrick's shoulder.\n\n'Hullo,' he said, 'you ain't writing 'ome.'\n\n'I am, though,' said Herrick; 'she lives with my father. Oh, I see what\nyou mean,' he added. 'My real name is Herrick. No more Hay'--they had\nboth used the same alias--'no more Hay than yours, I dare say.'\n\n'Clean bowled in the middle stump!' laughed the clerk. 'My name's 'Uish\nif you want to know. Everybody has a false nyme in the Pacific. Lay you\nfive to three the captain 'as.'\n\n'So I have too,' replied the captain; 'and I've never told my own since\nthe day I tore the title page out of my Bowditch and flung the damned\nthing into the sea. But I'll tell it to you, boys. John Davis is my\nname. I'm Davis of the Sea Ranger.'\n\n'Dooce you are!' said Hush. 'And what was she? a pirate or a slyver?'\n\n'She was the fastest barque out of Portland, Maine,' replied the\ncaptain; 'and for the way I lost her, I might as well have bored a hole\nin her side with an auger.'\n\n'Oh, you lost her, did you?' said the clerk. ''Ope she was insured?'\n\nNo answer being returned to this sally, Huish, still brimming over with\nvanity and conversation, struck into another subject.\n\n'I've a good mind to read you my letter,' said he. 'I've a good fist\nwith a pen when I choose, and this is a prime lark. She was a barmaid\nI ran across in Northampton; she was a spanking fine piece, no end\nof style; and we cottoned at first sight like parties in the play. I\nsuppose I spent the chynge of a fiver on that girl. Well, I 'appened to\nremember her nyme, so I wrote to her, and told her 'ow I had got rich,\nand married a queen in the Hislands, and lived in a blooming palace.\nSuch a sight of crammers! I must read you one bit about my opening the\nnigger parliament in a cocked 'at. It's really prime.'\n\nThe captain jumped to his feet. 'That's what you did with the paper that\nI went and begged for you?' he roared.\n\nIt was perhaps lucky for Huish--it was surely in the end unfortunate for\nall--that he was seized just then by one of his prostrating accesses of\ncough; his comrades would have else deserted him, so bitter was their\nresentment. When the fit had passed, the clerk reached out his hand,\npicked up the letter, which had fallen to the earth, and tore it into\nfragments, stamp and all.\n\n'Does that satisfy you?' he asked sullenly.\n\n'We'll say no more about it,' replied Davis.\n\n\n\nChapter 3. THE OLD CALABOOSE--DESTINY AT THE DOOR\n\nThe old calaboose, in which the waifs had so long harboured, is a low,\nrectangular enclosure of building at the corner of a shady western\navenue and a little townward of the British consulate. Within was\na grassy court, littered with wreckage and the traces of vagrant\noccupation. Six or seven cells opened from the court: the doors, that\nhad once been locked on mutinous whalermen, rotting before them in the\ngrass. No mark remained of their old destination, except the rusty bars\nupon the windows.\n\nThe floor of one of the cells had been a little cleared; a bucket (the\nlast remaining piece of furniture of the three caitiffs) stood full of\nwater by the door, a half cocoanut shell beside it for a drinking cup;\nand on some ragged ends of mat Huish sprawled asleep, his mouth open,\nhis face deathly. The glow of the tropic afternoon, the green of\nsunbright foliage, stared into that shady place through door and window;\nand Herrick, pacing to and fro on the coral floor, sometimes paused\nand laved his face and neck with tepid water from the bucket. His long\narrears of suffering, the night's vigil, the insults of the morning, and\nthe harrowing business of the letter, had strung him to that point when\npain is almost pleasure, time shrinks to a mere point, and death and\nlife appear indifferent. To and fro he paced like a caged brute; his\nmind whirling through the universe of thought and memory; his eyes, as\nhe went, skimming the legends on the wall. The crumbling whitewash was\nall full of them: Tahitian names, and French, and English, and rude\nsketches of ships under sail and men at fisticuffs.\n\nIt came to him of a sudden that he too must leave upon these walls the\nmemorial of his passage. He paused before a clean space, took the pencil\nout, and pondered. Vanity, so hard to dislodge, awoke in him. We call it\nvanity at least; perhaps unjustly. Rather it was the bare sense of his\nexistence prompted him; the sense of his life, the one thing wonderful,\nto which he scarce clung with a finger. From his jarred nerves there\ncame a strong sentiment of coming change; whether good or ill he could\nnot say: change, he knew no more--change, with inscrutable veiled face,\napproaching noiseless. With the feeling, came the vision of a concert\nroom, the rich hues of instruments, the silent audience, and the loud\nvoice of the symphony. 'Destiny knocking at the door,' he thought; drew\na stave on the plaster, and wrote in the famous phrase from the Fifth\nSymphony. 'So,' thought he, 'they will know that I loved music and had\nclassical tastes. They? He, I suppose: the unknown, kindred spirit that\nshall come some day and read my memor querela. Ha, he shall have Latin\ntoo!' And he added: terque quaterque beati Queis ante ora patrum.\n\nHe turned again to his uneasy pacing, but now with an irrational and\nsupporting sense of duty done. He had dug his grave that morning; now he\nhad carved his epitaph; the folds of the toga were composed, why should\nhe delay the insignificant trifle that remained to do? He paused and\nlooked long in the face of the sleeping Huish, drinking disenchantment\nand distaste of life. He nauseated himself with that vile countenance.\nCould the thing continue? What bound him now? Had he no rights?--only\nthe obligation to go on, without discharge or furlough, bearing the\nunbearable? Ich trage unertragliches, the quotation rose in his mind; he\nrepeated the whole piece, one of the most perfect of the most perfect of\npoets; and a phrase struck him like a blow: Du, stolzes Herz, A hast\nes ja gewolit. Where was the pride of his heart? And he raged against\nhimself, as a man bites on a sore tooth, in a heady sensuality of scorn.\n'I have no pride, I have no heart, no manhood,' he thought, 'or why\nshould I prolong a life more shameful than the gallows? Or why should I\nhave fallen to it? No pride, no capacity, no force. Not even a bandit!\nand to be starving here with worse than banditti--with this trivial\nhell-hound!' His rage against his comrade rose and flooded him, and he\nshook a trembling fist at the sleeper.\n\nA swift step was audible. The captain appeared upon the threshold of the\ncell, panting and flushed, and with a foolish face of happiness. In his\narms he carried a loaf of bread and bottles of beer; the pockets of his\ncoat were bulging with cigars.\n\nHe rolled his treasures on the floor, grasped Herrick by both hands, and\ncrowed with laughter.\n\n'Broach the beer!' he shouted. 'Broach the beer, and glory hallelujah!'\n\n'Beer?' repeated Huish, struggling to his feet. 'Beer it is!' cried\nDavis. 'Beer and plenty of it. Any number of persons can use it (like\nLyon's tooth-tablet) with perfect propriety and neatness. Who's to\nofficiate?'\n\n'Leave me alone for that,' said the clerk. He knocked the necks off with\na lump of coral, and each drank in succession from the shell.\n\n'Have a weed,' said Davis. 'It's all in the bill.'\n\n'What is up?' asked Herrick.\n\nThe captain fell suddenly grave. 'I'm coming to that,' said he. 'I want\nto speak with Herrick here. You, Hay--or Huish, or whatever your name\nis--you take a weed and the other bottle, and go and see how the wind is\ndown by the purao. I'll call you when you're wanted!'\n\n'Hay? Secrets? That ain't the ticket,' said Huish.\n\n'Look here, my son,' said the captain, 'this is business, and don't you\nmake any mistake about it. If you're going to make trouble, you can\nhave it your own way and stop right here. Only get the thing right: if\nHerrick and I go, we take the beer. Savvy?'\n\n'Oh, I don't want to shove my oar in,' returned Huish. 'I'll cut right\nenough. Give me the swipes. You can jaw till you're blue in the face for\nwhat I care. I don't think it's the friendly touch: that's all.' And he\nshambled grumbling out of the cell into the staring sun.\n\nThe captain watched him clear of the courtyard; then turned to Herrick.\n\n'What is it?' asked Herrick thickly.\n\n'I'll tell you,' said Davis. 'I want to consult you. It's a chance we've\ngot. What's that?' he cried, pointing to the music on the wall.\n\n'What?' said the other. 'Oh, that! It's music; it's a phrase of\nBeethoven's I was writing up. It means Destiny knocking at the door.'\n\n'Does it?' said the captain, rather low; and he went near and studied\nthe inscription; 'and this French?' he asked, pointing to the Latin.\n\n'O, it just means I should have been luckier if I had died at horne,'\nreturned Herrick impatiently. 'What is this business?'\n\n'Destiny knocking at the door,' repeated the captain; and then, looking\nover his shoulder. 'Well, Mr Herrick, that's about what it comes to,' he\nadded.\n\n'What do you mean? Explain yourself,' said Herrick.\n\nBut the captain was again staring at the music. 'About how long ago\nsince you wrote up this truck?' he asked.\n\n'What does it matter?' exclaimed Herrick. 'I dare say half an hour.'\n\n'My God, it's strange!' cried Davis. 'There's some men would call that\naccidental: not me. That--' and he drew his thick finger under the\nmusic--'that's what I call Providence.'\n\n'You said we had a chance,' said Herrick.\n\n'Yes, SIR!' said the captain, wheeling suddenly face to face with\nhis companion. 'I did so. If you're the man I take you for, we have a\nchance.'\n\n'I don't know what you take me for,' was the reply. 'You can scarce take\nme too low.'\n\n'Shake hands, Mr Herrick,' said the captain. 'I know you. You're a\ngentleman and a man of spirit. I didn't want to speak before that bummer\nthere; you'll see why. But to you I'll rip it right out. I got a ship.'\n\n'A ship?' cried Herrick. 'What ship?'\n\n'That schooner we saw this morning off the passage.'\n\n'The schooner with the hospital flag?'\n\n'That's the hooker,' said Davis. 'She's the Farallone, hundred and\nsixty tons register, out of 'Frisco for Sydney, in California champagne.\nCaptain, mate, and one hand all died of the smallpox, same as they had\nround in the Paumotus, I guess. Captain and mate were the only white\nmen; all the hands Kanakas; seems a queer kind of outfit from a\nChristian port. Three of them left and a cook; didn't know where they\nwere; I can't think where they were either, if you come to that;\nWiseman must have been on the booze, I guess, to sail the course he did.\nHowever, there HE was, dead; and here are the Kanakas as good as lost.\nThey bummed around at sea like the babes in the wood; and tumbled\nend-on upon Tahiti. The consul here took charge. He offered the berth to\nWilliams; Williams had never had the smallpox and backed down. That was\nwhen I came in for the letter paper; I thought there was something up\nwhen the consul asked me to look in again; but I never let on to you\nfellows, so's you'd not be disappointed. Consul tried M'Neil; scared of\nsmallpox. He tried Capirati, that Corsican and Leblue, or whatever his\nname is, wouldn't lay a hand on it; all too fond of their sweet lives.\nLast of all, when there wasn't nobody else left to offer it to, he\noffers it to me. \"Brown, will you ship captain and take her to Sydney?\"\nsays he. \"Let me choose my own mate and another white hand,\" says I,\n\"for I don't hold with this Kanaka crew racket; give us all two months'\nadvance to get our clothes and instruments out of pawn, and I'll take\nstock tonight, fill up stores, and get to sea tomorrow before dark!\"\nThat's what I said. \"That's good enough,\" says the consul, \"and you\ncan count yourself damned lucky, Brown,\" says he. And he said it pretty\nmeaningful-appearing, too. However, that's all one now. I'll ship Huish\nbefore the mast--of course I'll let him berth aft--and I'll ship you\nmate at seventy-five dollars and two months' advance.'\n\n'Me mate? Why, I'm a landsman!' cried Herrick.\n\n'Guess you've got to learn,' said the captain. 'You don't fancy I'm\ngoing to skip and leave you rotting on the beach perhaps? I'm not that\nsort, old man. And you're handy anyway; I've been shipmates with worse.'\n\n'God knows I can't refuse,' said Herrick. 'God knows I thank you from my\nheart.'\n\n'That's all right,' said the captain. 'But it ain't all.' He turned\naside to light a cigar.\n\n'What else is there?' asked the other, with a pang of undefinable alarm.\n\n'I'm coming to that,' said Davis, and then paused a little. 'See here,'\nhe began, holding out his cigar between his finger and thumb, 'suppose\nyou figure up what this'll amount to. You don't catch on? Well, we\nget two months' advance; we can't get away from Papeete--our creditors\nwouldn't let us go--for less; it'll take us along about two months\nto get to Sydney; and when we get there, I just want to put it to you\nsquarely: What the better are we?'\n\n'We're off the beach at least,' said Herrick.\n\n'I guess there's a beach at Sydney,' returned the captain; 'and I'll\ntell you one thing, Mr Herrick--I don't mean to try. No, SIR! Sydney\nwill never see me.'\n\n'Speak out plain,' said Herrick.\n\n'Plain Dutch,' replied the captain. 'I'm going to own that schooner.\nIt's nothing new; it's done every year in the Pacific. Stephens stole a\nschooner the other day, didn't he? Hayes and Pease stole vessels all\nthe time. And it's the making of the crowd of us. See here--you think of\nthat cargo. Champagne! why, it's like as if it was put up on purpose. In\nPeru we'll sell that liquor off at the pier-head, and the schooner after\nit, if we can find a fool to buy her; and then light out for the mines.\nIf you'll back me up, I stake my life I carry it through.'\n\n'Captain,' said Herrick, with a quailing voice, 'don't do it!'\n\n'I'm desperate,' returned Davis. 'I've got a chance; I may never get\nanother. Herrick, say the word; back me up; I think we've starved\ntogether long enough for that.'\n\n'I can't do it. I'm sorry. I can't do it. I've not fallen as low as\nthat,' said Herrick, deadly pale.\n\n'What did you say this morning?' said Davis. 'That you couldn't beg?\nIt's the one thing or the other, my son.'\n\n'Ah, but this is the jail!' cried Herrick. 'Don't tempt me. It's the\njail.'\n\n'Did you hear what the skipper said on board that schooner?' pursued the\ncaptain. 'Well, I tell you he talked straight. The French have let us\nalone for a long time; It can't last longer; they've got their eye on\nus; and as sure as you live, in three weeks you'll be in jail whatever\nyou do. I read it in the consul's face.'\n\n'You forget, captain,' said the young man. 'There is another way. I can\ndie; and to say truth, I think I should have died three years ago.'\n\nThe captain folded his arms and looked the other in the face. 'Yes,'\nsaid he, 'yes, you can cut your throat; that's a frozen fact; much good\nmay it do you! And where do I come in?'\n\nThe light of a strange excitement came in Herrick's face. 'Both of us,'\nsaid he, 'both of us together. It's not possible you can enjoy this\nbusiness. Come,' and he reached out a timid hand, 'a few strokes in the\nlagoon--and rest!'\n\n'I tell you, Herrick, I'm 'most tempted to answer you the way the man\ndoes in the Bible, and say, \"Get thee behind me, Satan!\"' said the\ncaptain. 'What! you think I would go drown myself, and I got children\nstarving? Enjoy it? No, by God, I do not enjoy it! but it's the row\nI've got to hoe, and I'll hoe it till I drop right here. I have three of\nthem, you see, two boys and the one girl, Adar. The trouble is that you\nare not a parent yourself. I tell you, Herrick, I love you,' the man\nbroke out; 'I didn't take to you at first, you were so anglified and\ntony, but I love you now; it's a man that loves you stands here and\nwrestles with you. I can't go to sea with the bummer alone; it's not\npossible. Go drown yourself, and there goes my last chance--the last\nchance of a poor miserable beast, earning a crust to feed his family.\nI can't do nothing but sail ships, and I've no papers. And here I get\na chance, and you go back on me! Ah, you've no family, and that's where\nthe trouble is!'\n\n'I have indeed,' said Herrick.\n\n'Yes, I know,' said the captain, 'you think so. But no man's got\na family till he's got children. It's only the kids count. There's\nsomething about the little shavers... I can't talk of them. And if\nyou thought a cent about this father that I hear you talk of, or that\nsweetheart you were writing to this morning, you would feel like me. You\nwould say, What matters laws, and God, and that? My folks are hard up,\nI belong to them, I'll get them bread, or, by God! I'll get them wealth,\nif I have to burn down London for it. That's what you would say. And\nI'll tell you more: your heart is saying so this living minute. I can\nsee it in your face. You're thinking, Here's poor friendship for the man\nI've starved along of, and as for the girl that I set up to be in love\nwith, here's a mighty limp kind of a love that won't carry me as far\nas 'most any man would go for a demijohn of whisky. There's not much\nROmance to that love, anyway; it's not the kind they carry on about in\nsongbooks. But what's the good of my carrying on talking, when it's all\nin your inside as plain as print? I put the question to you once for\nall. Are you going to desert me in my hour of need?--you know if I've\ndeserted you--or will you give me your hand, and try a fresh deal, and\ngo home (as like as not) a millionaire? Say no, and God pity me! Say\nyes, and I'll make the little ones pray for you every night on their\nbended knees. \"God bless Mr Herrick!\" that's what they'll say, one after\nthe other, the old girl sitting there holding stakes at the foot of the\nbed, and the damned little innocents.. . He broke off. 'I don't often\nrip out about the kids,' he said; 'but when I do, there's something\nfetches loose.'\n\n'Captain,' said Herrick faintly, 'is there nothing else?'\n\n'I'll prophesy if you like,' said the captain with renewed vigour.\n'Refuse this, because you think yourself too honest, and before a\nmonth's out you'll be jailed for a sneak-thief. I give you the word\nfair. I can see it, Herrick, if you can't; you're breaking down.\nDon't think, if you refuse this chance, that you'll go on doing the\nevangelical; you're about through with your stock; and before you know\nwhere you are, you'll be right out on the other side. No, it's either\nthis for you; or else it's Caledonia. I bet you never were there, and\nsaw those white, shaved men, in their dust clothes and straw hats,\nprowling around in gangs in the lamplight at Noumea; they look like\nwolves, and they look like preachers, and they look like the sick; Hulsh\nis a daisy to the best of them. Well, there's your company. They're\nwaiting for you, Herrick, and you got to go; and that's a prophecy.'\n\nAnd as the man stood and shook through his great stature, he seemed\nindeed like one in whom the spirit of divination worked and might utter\noracles. Herrick looked at him, and looked away; It seemed not decent to\nspy upon such agitation; and the young man's courage sank.\n\n'You talk of going home,' he objected. 'We could never do that.'\n\n'WE could,' said the other. 'Captain Brown couldn't, nor Mr Hay, that\nshipped mate with him couldn't. But what's that to do with Captain Davis\nor Mr Herrick, you galoot?'\n\n'But Hayes had these wild islands where he used to call,' came the next\nfainter objection.\n\n'We have the wild islands of Peru,' retorted Davis. 'They were wild\nenough for Stephens, no longer agone than just last year. I guess\nthey'll be wild enough for us.'\n\n'And the crew?'\n\n'All Kanakas. Come, I see you're right, old man. I see you'll stand by.'\nAnd the captain once more offered his hand.\n\n'Have it your own way then,' said Herrick. 'I'll do it: a strange thing\nfor my father's son. But I'll do it. I'll stand by you, man, for good or\nevil.'\n\n'God bless you!' cried the captain, and stood silent. 'Herrick,' he\nadded with a smile, 'I believe I'd have died in my tracks, if you'd\nsaid, No!'\n\nAnd Herrick, looking at the man, half believed so also.\n\n'And now we'll go break it to the bummer,' said Davis.\n\n'I wonder how he'll take it,' said Herrick.\n\n'Him? Jump at it!' was the reply.\n\n\n\nChapter 4. THE YELLOW FLAG\n\nThe schooner Farallone lay well out in the jaws of the pass, where the\nterrified pilot had made haste to bring her to her moorings and escape.\nSeen from the beach through the thin line of shipping, two objects stood\nconspicuous to seaward: the little isle, on the one hand, with its palms\nand the guns and batteries raised forty years before in defence of Queen\nPomare's capital; the outcast Farallone, upon the other, banished to the\nthreshold of the port, rolling there to her scuppers, and flaunting the\nplague-flag as she rolled. A few sea birds screamed and cried about the\nship; and within easy range, a man-of-war guard boat hung off and on and\nglittered with the weapons of marines. The exuberant daylight and the\nblinding heaven of the tropics picked out and framed the pictures.\n\nA neat boat, manned by natives in uniform, and steered by the doctor\nof the port, put from shore towards three of the afternoon, and pulled\nsmartly for the schooner. The fore-sheets were heaped with sacks of\nflour, onions, and potatoes, perched among which was Huish dressed as\na foremast hand; a heap of chests and cases impeded the action of the\noarsmen; and in the stern, by the left hand of the doctor, sat Herrick,\ndressed in a fresh rig of slops, his brown beard trimmed to a point, a\npile of paper novels on his lap, and nursing the while between his feet\na chronometer, for which they had exchanged that of the Farallone, long\nsince run down and the rate lost.\n\nThey passed the guard boat, exchanging hails with the boat-swain's\nmate in charge, and drew near at last to the forbidden ship. Not a cat\nstirred, there was no speech of man; and the sea being exceeding high\noutside, and the reef close to where the schooner lay, the clamour of\nthe surf hung round her like the sound of battle.\n\n'Ohe la goelette!' sang out the doctor, with his best voice.\n\nInstantly, from the house where they had been stowing away stores, first\nDavis, and then the ragamuffin, swarthy crew made their appearance.\n\n'Hullo, Hay, that you?' said the captain, leaning on the rail. 'Tell the\nold man to lay her alongside, as if she was eggs. There's a hell of a\nrun of sea here, and his boat's brittle.'\n\nThe movement of the schooner was at that time more than usually violent.\nNow she heaved her side as high as a deep sea steamer's, and showed the\nflashing of her copper; now she swung swiftly toward the boat until her\nscuppers gurgled.\n\n'I hope you have sea legs,' observed the doctor. 'You will require\nthem.'\n\nIndeed, to board the Farallone, in that exposed position where she lay,\nwas an affair of some dexterity. The less precious goods were hoisted\nroughly in; the chronometer, after repeated failures, was passed gently\nand successfully from hand to hand; and there remained only the more\ndifficult business of embarking Huish. Even that piece of dead weight\n(shipped A.B. at eighteen dollars, and described by the captain to the\nconsul as an invaluable man) was at last hauled on board without mishap;\nand the doctor, with civil salutations, took his leave.\n\nThe three co-adventurers looked at each other, and Davis heaved a breath\nof relief.\n\n'Now let's get this chronometer fixed,' said he, and led the way\ninto the house. It was a fairly spacious place; two staterooms and a\ngood-sized pantry opened from the main cabin; the bulkheads were\npainted white, the floor laid with waxcloth. No litter, no sign of\nlife remained; for the effects of the dead men had been disinfected and\nconveyed on shore. Only on the table, in a saucer, some sulphur burned,\nand the fumes set them coughing as they entered. The captain peered into\nthe starboard stateroom, where the bed-clothes still lay tumbled in\nthe bunk, the blanket flung back as they had flung it back from the\ndisfigured corpse before its burial.\n\n'Now, I told these niggers to tumble that truck overboard,' grumbled\nDavis. 'Guess they were afraid to lay hands on it. Well, they've hosed\nthe place out; that's as much as can be expected, I suppose. Huish, lay\non to these blankets.'\n\n'See you blooming well far enough first,' said Huish, drawing back.\n\n'What's that?' snapped the captain. 'I'll tell you, my young friend, I\nthink you make a mistake. I'm captain here.'\n\n'Fat lot I care,' returned the clerk.\n\n'That so?' said Davis. 'Then you'll berth forward with the niggers! Walk\nright out of this cabin.'\n\n'Oh, I dessay!' said Huish. 'See any green in my eye? A lark's a lark.'\n\n'Well, now, I'll explain this business, and you'll see (once for all)\njust precisely how much lark there is to it,' said Davis. 'I'm captain,\nand I'm going to be it. One thing of three. First, you take my orders\nhere as cabin steward, in which case you mess with us. Or second, you\nrefuse, and I pack you forward--and you get as quick as the word's said.\nOr, third and last, I'll signal that man-of-war and send you ashore\nunder arrest for mutiny.'\n\n'And, of course, I wouldn't blow the gaff? O no!' replied the jeering\nHuish.\n\n'And who's to believe you, my son?' inquired the captain. 'No, sir!\nThere ain't no lark about my captainising. Enough said. Up with these\nblankets.'\n\nHuish was no fool, he knew when he was beaten; and he was no coward\neither, for he stepped to the bunk, took the infected bed-clothes\nfairly in his arms, and carried them out of the house without a check or\ntremor.\n\n'I was waiting for the chance,' said Davis to Herrick. 'I needn't do the\nsame with you, because you understand it for yourself.'\n\n'Are you going to berth here?' asked Herrick, following the captain into\nthe stateroom, where he began to adjust the chronometer in its place at\nthe bed-head.\n\n'Not much!' replied he. 'I guess I'll berth on deck. I don't know as I'm\nafraid, but I've no immediate use for confluent smallpox.'\n\n'I don't know that I'm afraid either,' said Herrick. 'But the thought of\nthese two men sticks in my throat; that captain and mate dying here, one\nopposite to the other. It's grim. I wonder what they said last?'\n\n'Wiseman and Wishart?' said the captain. 'Probably mighty small\npotatoes. That's a thing a fellow figures out for himself one way, and\nthe real business goes quite another. Perhaps Wiseman said, \"Here old\nman, fetch up the gin, I'm feeling powerful rocky.\" And perhaps Wishart\nsaid, \"Oh, hell!\"'\n\n'Well, that's grim enough,' said Herrick.\n\n'And so it is,' said Davis. 'There; there's that chronometer fixed. And\nnow it's about time to up anchor and clear out.'\n\nHe lit a cigar and stepped on deck.\n\n'Here, you! What's YOUR name?' he cried to one of the hands, a\nlean-flanked, clean-built fellow from some far western island, and of a\ndarkness almost approaching to the African.\n\n'Sally Day,' replied the man.\n\n'Devil it is,' said the captain. 'Didn't know we had ladies on board.\nWell, Sally, oblige me by hauling down that rag there. I'll do the same\nfor you another time.' He watched the yellow bunting as it was eased\npast the cross-trees and handed down on deck. 'You'll float no more\non this ship,' he observed. 'Muster the people aft, Mr Hay,' he added,\nspeaking unnecessarily loud, 'I've a word to say to them.'\n\nIt was with a singular sensation that Herrick prepared for the first\ntime to address a crew. He thanked his stars indeed, that they were\nnatives. But even natives, he reflected, might be critics too quick\nfor such a novice as himself; they might perceive some lapse from that\nprecise and cut-and-dry English which prevails on board a ship; it was\neven possible they understood no other; and he racked his brain, and\noverhauled his reminiscences of sea romance for some appropriate words.\n\n'Here, men! tumble aft!' he said. 'Lively now! All hands aft!'\n\nThey crowded in the alleyway like sheep.\n\n'Here they are, sir,' said Herrick.\n\nFor some time the captain continued to face the stern; then turned with\nferocious suddenness on the crew, and seemed to enjoy their shrinking.\n\n'Now,' he said, twisting his cigar in his mouth and toying with the\nspokes of the wheel, 'I'm Captain Brown. I command this ship. This is\nMr Hay, first officer. The other white man is cabin steward, but he'll\nstand watch and do his trick. My orders shall be obeyed smartly. You\nsavvy, \"smartly\"? There shall be no growling about the kaikai, which\nwill be above allowance. You'll put a handle to the mate's name, and\ntack on \"sir\" to every order I give you. If you're smart and quick, I'll\nmake this ship comfortable for all hands.' He took the cigar out of his\nmouth. 'If you're not,' he added, in a roaring voice, 'I'll make it a\nfloating hell. Now, Mr Hay, we'll pick watches, if you please.'\n\n'All right,' said Herrick.\n\n'You will please use \"sir\" when you address me, Mr Hay,' said the\ncaptain. 'I'll take the lady. Step to starboard, Sally.' And then he\nwhispered in Herrick's ear: 'take the old man.'\n\n'I'll take you, there,' said Herrick.\n\n'What's your name?' said the captain. 'What's that you say? Oh, that's\nno English; I'll have none of your highway gibberish on my ship. We'll\ncall you old Uncle Ned, because you've got no wool on the top of your\nhead, just the place where the wool ought to grow. Step to port, Uncle.\nDon't you hear Mr Hay has picked you? Then I'll take the white man.\nWhite Man, step to starboard. Now which of you two is the cook? You?\nThen Mr Hay takes your friend in the blue dungaree. Step to port,\nDungaree. There, we know who we all are: Dungaree, Uncle Ned, Sally Day,\nWhite Man, and Cook. All F.F.V.'s I guess. And now, Mr Hay, we'll up\nanchor, if you please.'\n\n'For Heaven's sake, tell me some of the words,' whispered Herrick.\n\nAn hour later, the Farallone was under all plain sail, the rudder hard\na-port, and the cheerfully clanking windlass had brought the anchor\nhome.\n\n'All clear, sir,' cried Herrick from the bow.\n\nThe captain met her with the wheel, as she bounded like a stag from\nher repose, trembling and bending to the puffs. The guard boat gave a\nparting hail, the wake whitened and ran out; the Farallone was under\nweigh.\n\nHer berth had been close to the pass. Even as she forged ahead Davis\nslewed her for the channel between the pier ends of the reef, the\nbreakers sounding and whitening to either hand. Straight through the\nnarrow band of blue, she shot to seaward: and the captain's heart\nexulted as he felt her tremble underfoot, and (looking back over the\ntaffrail) beheld the roofs of Papeete changing position on the shore and\nthe island mountains rearing higher in the wake.\n\nBut they were not yet done with the shore and the horror of the yellow\nflag. About midway of the pass, there was a cry and a scurry, a man was\nseen to leap upon the rail, and, throwing his arms over his head, to\nstoop and plunge into the sea.\n\n'Steady as she goes,' the captain cried, relinquishing the wheel to\nHuish.\n\nThe next moment he was forward in the midst of the Kanakas, belaying pin\nin hand.\n\n'Anybody else for shore?' he cried, and the savage trumpeting of his\nvoice, no less than the ready weapon in his hand, struck fear in all.\nStupidly they stared after their escaped companion, whose black head\nwas visible upon the water, steering for the land. And the schooner\nmeanwhile slipt like a racer through the pass, and met the long sea of\nthe open ocean with a souse of spray.\n\n'Fool that I was, not to have a pistol ready!' exclaimed Davis. 'Well,\nwe go to sea short-handed, we can't help that. You have a lame watch of\nit, Mr Hay.'\n\n'I don't see how we are to get along,' said Herrick.\n\n'Got to,' said the captain. 'No more Tahiti for me.'\n\nBoth turned instinctively and looked astern. The fair island was\nunfolding mountain top on mountain top; Eimeo, on the port board, lifted\nher splintered pinnacles; and still the schooner raced to the open sea.\n\n'Think!' cried the captain with a gesture, 'yesterday morning I danced\nfor my breakfast like a poodle dog.'\n\n\n\nChapter 5. THE CARGO OF CHAMPAGNE\n\nThe ship's head was laid to clear Eimeo to the north, and the captain\nsat down in the cabin, with a chart, a ruler, and an epitome.\n\n'East a half no'the,' said he, raising his face from his labours. 'Mr\nHay, you'll have to watch your dead reckoning; I want every yard she\nmakes on every hair's-breadth of a course. I'm going to knock a hole\nright straight through the Paumotus, and that's always a near touch.\nNow, if this South East Trade ever blew out of the S.E., which it don't,\nwe might hope to lie within half a point of our course. Say we lie\nwithin a point of it. That'll just about weather Fakarava. Yes, sir,\nthat's what we've got to do, if we tack for it. Brings us through this\nslush of little islands in the cleanest place: see?' And he showed\nwhere his ruler intersected the wide-lying labyrinth of the Dangerous\nArchipelago. 'I wish it was night, and I could put her about right now;\nwe're losing time and easting. Well, we'll do our best. And if we don't\nfetch Peru, we'll bring up to Ecuador. All one, I guess. Depreciated\ndollars down, and no questions asked. A remarkable fine institootion,\nthe South American don.'\n\nTahiti was already some way astern, the Diadem rising from among broken\nmountains--Eimeo was already close aboard, and stood black and strange\nagainst the golden splendour of the west--when the captain took his\ndeparture from the two islands, and the patent log was set.\n\nSome twenty minutes later, Sally Day, who was continually leaving\nthe wheel to peer in at the cabin clock, announced in a shrill cry\n'Fo'bell,' and the cook was to be seen carrying the soup into the cabin.\n\n'I guess I'll sit down and have a pick with you,' said Davis to Herrick.\n'By the time I've done, it'll be dark, and we'll clap the hooker on the\nwind for South America.'\n\nIn the cabin at one corner of the table, immediately below the lamp, and\non the lee side of a bottle of champagne, sat Huish. 'What's this? Where\ndid that come from?' asked the captain.\n\n'It's fizz, and it came from the after-'old, if you want to know,' said\nHuish, and drained his mug.\n\n'This'll never do,' exclaimed Davis, the merchant seaman's horror of\nbreaking into cargo showing incongruously forth on board that stolen\nship. 'There was never any good came of games like that.'\n\n'You byby!' said Huish. 'A fellow would think (to 'ear him) we were\non the square! And look 'ere, you've put this job up 'ansomely for me,\n'aven't you? I'm to go on deck and steer while you two sit and guzzle,\nand I'm to go by nickname, and got to call you \"sir\" and \"mister.\" Well,\nyou look here, my bloke: I'll have fizz ad lib., or it won't wash. I\ntell you that. And you know mighty well, you ain't got any man-of-war to\nsignal now.'\n\nDavis was staggered. 'I'd give fifty dollars this had never happened,'\nhe said weakly.\n\n'Well, it 'as 'appened, you see,' returned Huish. 'Try some; it's\ndevilish good.'\n\nThe Rubicon was crossed without another struggle. The captain filled a\nmug and drank.\n\n'I wish it was beer,' he said with a sigh. 'But there's no denying it's\nthe genuine stuff and cheap at the money. Now, Huish, you clear out and\ntake your wheel.'\n\nThe little wretch had gained a point, and he was gay. 'Ay, ay, sir,'\nsaid he, and left the others to their meal.\n\n'Pea soup!' exclaimed the captain. 'Blamed if I thought I should taste\npea soup again!'\n\nHerrick sat inert and silent. It was impossible after these months of\nhopeless want to smell the rough, high-spiced sea victuals without\nlust, and his mouth watered with desire of the champagne. It was no less\nimpossible to have assisted at the scene between Huish and the captain,\nand not to perceive, with sudden bluntness, the gulf where he had\nfallen. He was a thief among thieves. He said it to himself. He could\nnot touch the soup. If he had moved at all, it must have been to leave\nthe table, throw himself overboard, and drown--an honest man.\n\n'Here,' said the captain, 'you look sick, old man; have a drop of this.'\n\nThe champagne creamed and bubbled in the mug; its bright colour, its\nlively effervescence, seized his eye. 'It is too late to hesitate,'\nhe thought; his hand took the mug instinctively; he drank, with\nunquenchable pleasure and desire of more; drained the vessel dry, and\nset it down with sparkling eyes.\n\n'There is something in life after all!' he cried. 'I had forgot what it\nwas like. Yes, even this is worth while. Wine, food, dry clothes--why,\nthey're worth dying, worth hanging, for! Captain, tell me one thing: why\naren't all the poor folk foot-pads?'\n\n'Give it up,' said the captain.\n\n'They must be damned good,' cried Herrick. 'There's something here\nbeyond me. Think of that calaboose! Suppose we were sent suddenly back.'\nHe shuddered as though stung by a convulsion, and buried his face in his\nclutching hands.\n\n'Here, what's wrong with you?' cried the captain. There was no reply;\nonly Herrick's shoulders heaved, so that the table was shaken. 'Take\nsome more of this. Here, drink this. I order you to. Don't start crying\nwhen you're out of the wood.'\n\n'I'm not crying,' said Herrick, raising his face and showing his dry\neyes. 'It's worse than crying. It's the horror of that grave that we've\nescaped from.'\n\n'Come now, you tackle your soup; that'll fix you,' said Davis kindly.\n'I told you you were all broken up. You couldn't have stood out another\nweek.'\n\n'That's the dreadful part of it!' cried Herrick. 'Another week and I'd\nhave murdered someone for a dollar! God! and I know that? And I'm still\nliving? It's some beastly dream.'\n\n'Quietly, quietly! Quietly does it, my son. Take your pea soup. Food,\nthat's what you want,' said Davis.\n\nThe soup strengthened and quieted Herrick's nerves; another glass of\nwine, and a piece of pickled pork and fried banana completed what the\nsoup began; and he was able once more to look the captain in the face.\n\n'I didn't know I was so much run down,' he said.\n\n'Well,' said Davis, 'you were as steady as a rock all day: now you've\nhad a little lunch, you'll be as steady as a rock again.'\n\n'Yes,'was the reply, 'I'm steady enough now, but I'm a queer kind of a\nfirst officer.'\n\n'Shucks!' cried the captain. 'You've only got to mind the ship's course,\nand keep your slate to half a point. A babby could do that, let alone\na college graduate like you. There ain't nothing TO sailoring, when you\ncome to look it in the face. And now we'll go and put her about. Bring\nthe slate; we'll have to start our dead reckoning right away.'\n\nThe distance run since the departure was read off the log by the\nbinnacle light and entered on the slate.\n\n'Ready about,' said the captain. 'Give me the wheel, White Man, and you\nstand by the mainsheet. Boom tackle, Mr Hay, please, and then you can\njump forward and attend head sails.'\n\n'Ay, ay, sir,' responded Herrick.\n\n'All clear forward?' asked Davis.\n\n'All clear, sir.'\n\n'Hard a-lee!' cried the captain. 'Haul in your slack as she comes,' he\ncalled to Huish. 'Haul in your slack, put your back into it; keep your\nfeet out of the coils.' A sudden blow sent Huish flat along the deck,\nand the captain was in his place. 'Pick yourself up and keep the wheel\nhard over!' he roared. 'You wooden fool, you wanted to get killed, I\nguess. Draw the jib,' he cried a moment later; and then to Huish, 'Give\nme the wheel again, and see if you can coil that sheet.'\n\nBut Huish stood and looked at Davis with an evil countenance. 'Do you\nknow you struck me?' said he.\n\n'Do you know I saved your life?' returned the other, not deigning to\nlook at him, his eyes travelling instead between the compass and the\nsails. 'Where would you have been, if that boom had swung out and\nyou bundled in the clack? No, SIR, we'll have no more of you at the\nmainsheet. Seaport towns are full of mainsheet-men; they hop upon one\nleg, my son, what's left of them, and the rest are dead. (Set your boom\ntackle, Mr Hay.) Struck you, did I? Lucky for you I did.'\n\n'Well,' said Huish slowly, 'I daresay there may be somethink in that.\n'Ope there is.' He turned his back elaborately on the captain, and\nentered the house, where the speedy explosion of a champagne cork showed\nhe was attending to his comfort.\n\nHerrick came aft to the captain. 'How is she doing now?' he asked.\n\n'East and by no'the a half no'the,' said Davis. 'It's about as good as I\nexpected.'\n\n'What'll the hands think of it?' said Herrick.\n\n'Oh, they don't think. They ain't paid to,' says the captain.\n\n'There was something wrong, was there not? between you and--' Herrick\npaused.\n\n'That's a nasty little beast, that's a biter,' replied the captain,\nshaking his head. 'But so long as you and me hang in, it don't matter.'\n\nHerrick lay down in the weather alleyway; the night was cloudless, the\nmovement of the ship cradled him, he was oppressed besides by the first\ngenerous meal after so long a time of famine; and he was recalled from\ndeep sleep by the voice of Davis singing out: 'Eight bells!'\n\nHe rose stupidly, and staggered aft, where the captain gave him the\nwheel.\n\n'By the wind,' said the captain. 'It comes a little puffy; when you get\na heavy puff, steal all you can to windward, but keep her a good full.'\n\nHe stepped towards the house, paused and hailed the forecastle.\n\n'Got such a thing as a concertina forward?' said he. 'Bully for you,\nUncle Ned. Fetch it aft, will you?'\n\nThe schooner steered very easy; and Herrick, watching the moon-whitened\nsails, was overpowered by drowsiness. A sharp report from the cabin\nstartled him; a third bottle had been opened; and Herrick remembered\nthe Sea Ranger and Fourteen Island Group. Presently the notes of the\naccordion sounded, and then the captain's voice:\n\n  'O honey, with our pockets full of money,\n\n  We will trip, trip, trip, we will trip it on the quay,\n\n  And I will dance with Kate, and Tom will dance with Sall,\n\n  When we're all back from South Amerikee.'\n\nSo it went to its quaint air; and the watch below lingered and listened\nby the forward door, and Uncle Ned was to be seen in the moonlight\nnodding time; and Herrick smiled at the wheel, his anxieties a while\nforgotten. Song followed song; another cork exploded; there were voices\nraised, as though the pair in the cabin were in disagreement; and\npresently it seemed the breach was healed; for it was now the voice of\nHuish that struck up, to the captain's accompaniment--\n\n\n     'Up in a balloon, boys,\n\n      Up in a balloon,\n\n     All among the little stars\n\n      And round about the moon.'\n\n\nA wave of nausea overcame Herrick at the wheel. He wondered why the air,\nthe words (which were yet written with a certain knack), and the voice\nand accent of the singer, should all jar his spirit like a file on a\nman's teeth. He sickened at the thought of his two comrades drinking\naway their reason upon stolen wine, quarrelling and hiccupping and\nwaking up, while the doors of the prison yawned for them in the near\nfuture. 'Shall I have sold my honour for nothing?' he thought; and\na heat of rage and resolution glowed in his bosom--rage against his\ncomrades--resolution to carry through this business if it might be\ncarried; pluck profit out of shame, since the shame at least was now\ninevitable; and come home, home from South America--how did the song\ngo?--'with his pockets full of money':\n\n\n'O honey, with our pockets full of money,\n\nWe will trip, trip, trip, we will trip it on the quay:'\n\nso the words ran in his head; and the honey took on visible form, the\nquay rose before him and he knew it for the lamplit Embankment, and\nhe saw the lights of Battersea bridge bestride the sullen river. All\nthrough the remainder of his trick, he stood entranced, reviewing the\npast. He had been always true to his love, but not always sedulous\nto recall her. In the growing calamity of his life, she had swum\nmore distant, like the moon in mist. The letter of farewell, the\ndishonourable hope that had surprised and corrupted him in his distress,\nthe changed scene, the sea, the night and the music--all stirred him\nto the roots of manhood. 'I WILL win her,' he thought, and ground his\nteeth. 'Fair or foul, what matters if I win her?'\n\n'Fo' bell, matey. I think um fo' bell'--he was suddenly recalled by\nthese words in the voice of Uncle Ned.\n\n'Look in at the clock, Uncle,' said he. He would not look himself, from\nhorror of the tipplers.\n\n'Him past, matey,' repeated the Hawaiian.\n\n'So much the better for you, Uncle,' he replied; and he gave up the\nwheel, repeating the directions as he had received them.\n\nHe took two steps forward and remembered his dead reckoning. 'How has\nshe been heading?' he thought; and he flushed from head to foot. He had\nnot observed or had forgotten; here was the old incompetence; the slate\nmust be filled up by guess. 'Never again!' he vowed to himself in silent\nfury, 'never again. It shall be no fault of mine if this miscarry.' And\nfor the remainder of his watch, he stood close by Uncle Ned, and read\nthe face of the compass as perhaps he had never read a letter from his\nsweetheart.\n\nAll the time, and spurring him to the more attention, song, loud talk,\nfleering laughter and the occasional popping of a cork, reached his ears\nfrom the interior of the house; and when the port watch was relieved\nat midnight, Huish and the captain appeared upon the quarter-deck with\nflushed faces and uneven steps, the former laden with bottles, the\nlatter with two tin mugs. Herrick silently passed them by. They hailed\nhim in thick voices, he made no answer, they cursed him for a churl,\nhe paid no heed although his belly quivered with disgust and rage. He\nclosed-to the door of the house behind him, and cast himself on a locker\nin the cabin--not to sleep he thought--rather to think and to despair.\nYet he had scarce turned twice on his uneasy bed, before a drunken voice\nhailed him in the ear, and he must go on deck again to stand the morning\nwatch.\n\nThe first evening set the model for those that were to follow. Two cases\nof champagne scarce lasted the four-and-twenty hours, and almost the\nwhole was drunk by Huish and the captain. Huish seemed to thrive on the\nexcess; he was never sober, yet never wholly tipsy; the food and the sea\nair had soon healed him of his disease, and he began to lay on flesh.\nBut with Davis things went worse. In the drooping, unbuttoned figure\nthat sprawled all day upon the lockers, tippling and reading novels;\nin the fool who made of the evening watch a public carouse on the\nquarter-deck, it would have been hard to recognise the vigorous seaman\nof Papeete roads. He kept himself reasonably well in hand till he had\ntaken the sun and yawned and blotted through his calculations; but from\nthe moment he rolled up the chart, his hours were passed in slavish\nself-indulgence or in hoggish slumber. Every other branch of his duty\nwas neglected, except maintaining a stern discipline about the dinner\ntable. Again and again Herrick would hear the cook called aft, and see\nhim running with fresh tins, or carrying away again a meal that had been\ntotally condemned. And the more the captain became sunk in drunkenness,\nthe more delicate his palate showed itself. Once, in the forenoon, he\nhad a bo'sun's chair rigged over the rail, stripped to his trousers,\nand went overboard with a pot of paint. 'I don't like the way this\nschooner's painted,' said he, 'and I've taken a down upon her name.' But\nhe tired of it in half an hour, and the schooner went on her way with\nan incongruous patch of colour on the stern, and the word Farallone part\nobliterated and part looking through. He refused to stand either the\nmiddle or the morning watch. It was fine-weather sailing, he said;\nand asked, with a laugh, 'Who ever heard of the old man standing watch\nhimself?' To the dead reckoning which Herrick still tried to keep, he\nwould pay not the least attention nor afford the least assistance.\n\n'What do we want of dead reckoning?' he asked. 'We get the sun all\nright, don't we?'\n\n'We mayn't get it always though,' objected Herrick. 'And you told me\nyourself you weren't sure of the chronometer.'\n\n'Oh, there ain't no flies in the chronometer!' cried Davis.\n\n'Oblige me so far, captain,' said Herrick stiffly. 'I am anxious to keep\nthis reckoning, which is a part of my duty; I do not know what to allow\nfor current, nor how to allow for it. I am too inexperienced; and I beg\nof you to help me.'\n\n'Never discourage zealous officer,' said the captain, unrolling the\nchart again, for Herrick had taken him over his day's work and while he\nwas still partly sober. 'Here it is: look for yourself; anything from\nwest to west no'the-west, and anyways from five to twenty-five miles.\nThat's what the A'm'ralty chart says; I guess you don't expect to get on\nahead of your own Britishers?'\n\n'I am trying to do my duty, Captain Brown,' said Herrick, with a dark\nflush, 'and I have the honour to inform you that I don't enjoy being\ntrifled with.'\n\n'What in thunder do you want?' roared Davis. 'Go and look at the blamed\nwake. If you're trying to do your duty, why don't you go and do it? I\nguess it's no business of mine to go and stick my head over the ship's\nrump? I guess it's yours. And I'll tell you what it is, my fine fellow,\nI'll trouble you not to come the dude over me. You're insolent, that's\nwhat's wrong with you. Don't you crowd me, Mr Herrick, Esquire.'\n\nHerrick tore up his papers, threw them on the floor, and left the cabin.\n\n'He's turned a bloomin' swot, ain't he?' sneered Huish.\n\n'He thinks himself too good for his company, that's what ails Herrick,\nEsquire,' raged the captain. 'He thinks I don't understand when he comes\nthe heavy swell. Won't sit down with us, won't he? won't say a civil\nword? I'll serve the son of a gun as he deserves. By God, Huish, I'll\nshow him whether he's too good for John Davis!'\n\n'Easy with the names, cap',' said Huish, who was always the more sober.\n'Easy over the stones, my boy!'\n\n'All right, I will. You're a good sort, Huish. I didn't take to you at\nfirst, but I guess you're right enough. Let's open another bottle,'\nsaid the captain; and that day, perhaps because he was excited by the\nquarrel, he drank more recklessly, and by four o'clock was stretched\ninsensible upon the locker.\n\nHerrick and Huish supped alone, one after the other, opposite his\nflushed and snorting body. And if the sight killed Herrick's hunger, the\nisolation weighed so heavily on the clerk's spirit, that he was scarce\nrisen from table ere he was currying favour with his former comrade.\n\nHerrick was at the wheel when he approached, and Huish leaned\nconfidentially across the binnacle.\n\n'I say, old chappie,' he said, 'you and me don't seem to be such pals\nsomehow.'\n\nHerrick gave her a spoke or two in silence; his eye, as it skirted\nfrom the needle to the luff of the foresail, passed the man by without\nspeculation. But Huish was really dull, a thing he could support with\ndifficulty, having no resources of his own. The idea of a private talk\nwith Herrick, at this stage of their relations, held out particular\ninducements to a person of his character. Drink besides, as it renders\nsome men hyper-sensitive, made Huish callous. And it would almost have\nrequired a blow to make him quit his purpose.\n\n'Pretty business, ain't it?' he continued; 'Dyvis on the lush? Must say\nI thought you gave it 'im A1 today. He didn't like it a bit; took on\nhawful after you were gone.--\"'Ere,\" says I, \"'old on, easy on the\nlush,\" I says. \"'Errick was right, and you know it. Give 'im a chanst,\"\nI says.--\"Uish,\" sezee, \"don't you gimme no more of your jaw, or I'll\nknock your bloomin' eyes out.\" Well, wot can I do, 'Errick? But I tell\nyou, I don't 'arf like it. It looks to me like the Sea Rynger over\nagain.'\n\nStill Herrick was silent.\n\n'Do you hear me speak?' asked Huish sharply. 'You're pleasant, ain't\nyou?'\n\n'Stand away from that binnacle,' said Herrick.\n\nThe clerk looked at him, long and straight and black; his figure seemed\nto writhe like that of a snake about to strike; then he turned on his\nheel, went back to the cabin and opened a bottle of champagne. When\neight bells were cried, he slept on the floor beside the captain on the\nlocker; and of the whole starboard watch, only Sally Day appeared upon\nthe summons. The mate proposed to stand the watch with him, and let\nUncle Ned lie down; it would make twelve hours on deck, and probably\nsixteen, but in this fair-weather sailing, he might safely sleep between\nhis tricks of wheel, leaving orders to be called on any sign of squalls.\nSo far he could trust the men, between whom and himself a close relation\nhad sprung up. With Uncle Ned he held long nocturnal conversations, and\nthe old man told him his simple and hard story of exile, suffering, and\ninjustice among cruel whites. The cook, when he found Herrick messed\nalone, produced for him unexpected and sometimes unpalatable dainties,\nof which he forced himself to eat. And one day, when he was forward,\nhe was surprised to feel a caressing hand run down his shoulder, and to\nhear the voice of Sally Day crooning in his ear: 'You gootch man!' He\nturned, and, choking down a sob, shook hands with the negrito. They were\nkindly, cheery, childish souls. Upon the Sunday each brought forth\nhis separate Bible--for they were all men of alien speech even to each\nother, and Sally Day communicated with his mates in English only, each\nread or made believe to read his chapter, Uncle Ned with spectacles on\nhis nose; and they would all join together in the singing of missionary\nhymns. It was thus a cutting reproof to compare the islanders and the\nwhites aboard the Farallone. Shame ran in Herrick's blood to remember\nwhat employment he was on, and to see these poor souls--and even Sally\nDay, the child of cannibals, in all likelihood a cannibal himself--so\nfaithful to what they knew of good. The fact that he was held in\ngrateful favour by these innocents served like blinders to his\nconscience, and there were times when he was inclined, with Sally Day,\nto call himself a good man. But the height of his favour was only now to\nappear. With one voice, the crew protested; ere Herrick knew what they\nwere doing, the cook was aroused and came a willing volunteer; all hands\nclustered about their mate with expostulations and caresses; and he was\nbidden to lie down and take his customary rest without alarm.\n\n'He tell you tlue,' said Uncle Ned. 'You sleep. Evely man hae he do all\nlight. Evely man he like you too much.'\n\nHerrick struggled, and gave way; choked upon some trivial words of\ngratitude; and walked to the side of the house, against which he leaned,\nstruggling with emotion.\n\nUncle Ned presently followed him and begged him to lie down.\n\n'It's no use, Uncle Ned,' he replied. 'I couldn't sleep. I'm knocked\nover with all your goodness.'\n\n'Ah, no call me Uncle Ned no mo'!' cried the old man. 'No my name! My\nname Taveeta, all-e-same Taveeta King of Islael. Wat for he call that\nHawaii? I think no savvy nothing--all-e-same Wise-a-mana.'\n\nIt was the first time the name of the late captain had been mentioned,\nand Herrick grasped the occasion. The reader shall be spared Uncle Ned's\nunwieldy dialect, and learn in less embarrassing English, the sum of\nwhat he now communicated. The ship had scarce cleared the Golden Gates\nbefore the captain and mate had entered on a career of drunkenness,\nwhich was scarcely interrupted by their malady and only closed by death.\nFor days and weeks they had encountered neither land nor ship; and\nseeing themselves lost on the huge deep with their insane conductors,\nthe natives had drunk deep of terror.\n\nAt length they made a low island, and went in; and Wiseman and Wishart\nlanded in the boat.\n\nThere was a great village, a very fine village, and plenty Kanakas in\nthat place; but all mighty serious; and from every here and there in\nthe back parts of the settlement, Taveeta heard the sounds of island\nlamentation. 'I no savvy TALK that island,' said he. 'I savvy hear\num CLY. I think, Hum! too many people die here!' But upon Wiseman and\nWishart the significance of that barbaric keening was lost. Full of\nbread and drink, they rollicked along unconcerned, embraced the girls\nwho had scarce energy to repel them, took up and joined (with drunken\nvoices) in the death wail, and at last (on what they took to be\nan invitation) entered under the roof of a house in which was a\nconsiderable concourse of people sitting silent. They stooped below the\neaves, flushed and laughing; within a minute they came forth again with\nchanged faces and silent tongues; and as the press severed to make way\nfor them, Taveeta was able to perceive, in the deep shadow of the house,\nthe sick man raising from his mat a head already defeatured by disease.\nThe two tragic triflers fled without hesitation for their boat,\nscreaming on Taveeta to make haste; they came aboard with all speed\nof oars, raised anchor and crowded sail upon the ship with blows and\ncurses, and were at sea again--and again drunk--before sunset. A week\nafter, and the last of the two had been committed to the deep. Herrick\nasked Taveeta where that island was, and he replied that, by what he\ngathered of folks' talk as they went up together from the beach, he\nsupposed it must be one of the Paumotus. This was in itself probable\nenough, for the Dangerous Archipelago had been swept that year from east\nto west by devastating smallpox; but Herrick thought it a strange course\nto lie from Sydney. Then he remembered the drink.\n\n'Were they not surprised when they made the island?' he asked.\n\n'Wise-a-mana he say \"dam! what this?\"' was the reply.\n\n'O, that's it then,' said Herrick. 'I don't believe they knew where they\nwere.'\n\n'I think so too,' said Uncle Ned. 'I think no savvy. This one mo'\nbetta,' he added, pointing to the house where the drunken captain\nslumbered: 'Take-a-sun all-e-time.'\n\nThe implied last touch completed Herrick's picture of the life and death\nof his two predecessors; of their prolonged, sordid, sodden sensuality\nas they sailed, they knew not whither, on their last cruise. He held but\na twinkling and unsure belief in any future state; the thought of one\nof punishment he derided; yet for him (as for all) there dwelt a horror\nabout the end of the brutish man. Sickness fell upon him at the image\nthus called up; and when he compared it with the scene in which himself\nwas acting, and considered the doom that seemed to brood upon the\nschooner, a horror that was almost superstitious fell upon him. And\nyet the strange thing was, he did not falter. He who had proved his\nincapacity in so many fields, being now falsely placed amid duties\nwhich he did not understand, without help, and it might be said without\ncountenance, had hitherto surpassed expectation; and even the shameful\nmisconduct and shocking disclosures of that night seemed but to nerve\nand strengthen him. He had sold his honour; he vowed it should not be in\nvain; 'it shall be no fault of mine if this miscarry,' he repeated. And\nin his heart he wondered at himself. Living rage no doubt supported him;\nno doubt also, the sense of the last cast, of the ships burned, of all\ndoors closed but one, which is so strong a tonic to the merely weak, and\nso deadly a depressant to the merely cowardly.\n\nFor some time the voyage went otherwise well. They weathered Fakarava\nwith one board; and the wind holding well to the southward and\nblowing fresh, they passed between Ranaka and Ratiu, and ran some days\nnorth-east by east-half-east under the lee of Takume and Honden, neither\nof which they made. In about 14 degrees South and between 134 and 135\ndegrees West, it fell a dead calm with rather a heavy sea. The captain\nrefused to take in sail, the helm was lashed, no watch was set, and the\nFarallone rolled and banged for three days, according to observation, in\nalmost the same place. The fourth morning, a little before day, a breeze\nsprang up and rapidly freshened. The captain had drunk hard the night\nbefore; he was far from sober when he was roused; and when he came on\ndeck for the first time at half-past eight, it was plain he had already\ndrunk deep again at breakfast. Herrick avoided his eye; and resigned the\ndeck with indignation to a man more than half-seas over.\n\nBy the loud commands of the captain and the singing out of fellows at\nthe ropes, he could judge from the house that sail was being crowded on\nthe ship; relinquished his half-eaten breakfast; and came on deck again,\nto find the main and the jib topsails set, and both watches and the cook\nturned out to hand the staysail. The Farallone lay already far over;\nthe sky was obscured with misty scud; and from the windward an ominous\nsquall came flying up, broadening and blackening as it rose.\n\nFear thrilled in Herrick's vitals. He saw death hard by; and if not\ndeath, sure ruin. For if the Farallone lived through the coming squall,\nshe must surely be dismasted. With that their enterprise was at an end,\nand they themselves bound prisoners to the very evidence of their crime.\nThe greatness of the peril and his own alarm sufficed to silence him.\nPride, wrath, and shame raged without issue in his mind; and he shut his\nteeth and folded his arms close.\n\nThe captain sat in the boat to windward, bellowing orders and insults,\nhis eyes glazed, his face deeply congested; a bottle set between his\nknees, a glass in his hand half empty. His back was to the squall, and\nhe was at first intent upon the setting of the sail. When that was done,\nand the great trapezium of canvas had begun to draw and to trail the\nlee-rail of the Farallone level with the foam, he laughed out an empty\nlaugh, drained his glass, sprawled back among the lumber in the boat,\nand fetched out a crumpled novel.\n\nHerrick watched him, and his indignation glowed red hot. He glanced to\nwindward where the squall already whitened the near sea and heralded its\ncoming with a singular and dismal sound. He glanced at the steersman,\nand saw him clinging to the spokes with a face of a sickly blue. He saw\nthe crew were running to their stations without orders. And it seemed\nas if something broke in his brain; and the passion of anger, so long\nrestrained, so long eaten in secret, burst suddenly loose and shook him\nlike a sail. He stepped across to the captain and smote his hand heavily\non the drunkard's shoulder.\n\n'You brute,' he said, in a voice that tottered, 'look behind you!'\n\n'Wha's that?' cried Davis, bounding in the boat and upsetting the\nchampagne.\n\n'You lost the Sea Ranger because you were a drunken sot,' said Herrick.\n'Now you're going to lose the Farallone. You're going to drown here the\nsame way as you drowned others, and be damned. And your daughter shall\nwalk the streets, and your sons be thieves like their father.'\n\nFor the moment, the words struck the captain white and foolish. 'My\nGod!' he cried, looking at Herrick as upon a ghost; 'my God, Herrick!'\n\n'Look behind you, then!' reiterated the assailant.\n\nThe wretched man, already partly sobered, did as he was told, and in the\nsame breath of time leaped to his feet. 'Down staysail!' he trumpeted.\nThe hands were thrilling for the order, and the great sail came with\na run, and fell half overboard among the racing foam. 'Jib\ntopsail-halyards! Let the stays'l be,' he said again.\n\nBut before it was well uttered, the squall shouted aloud and fell, in\na solid mass of wind and rain commingled, on the Farallone; and she\nstooped under the blow, and lay like a thing dead. From the mind of\nHerrick reason fled; he clung in the weather rigging, exulting; he was\ndone with life, and he gloried in the release; he gloried in the wild\nnoises of the wind and the choking onslaught of the rain; he gloried to\ndie so, and now, amid this coil of the elements. And meanwhile, in the\nwaist up to his knees in water--so low the schooner lay--the captain\nwas hacking at the foresheet with a pocket knife. It was a question of\nseconds, for the Farallone drank deep of the encroaching seas. But the\nhand of the captain had the advance; the foresail boom tore apart the\nlast strands of the sheet and crashed to leeward; the Farallone leaped\nup into the wind and righted; and the peak and throat halyards, which\nhad long been let go, began to run at the same instant.\n\nFor some ten minutes more she careered under the impulse of the squall;\nbut the captain was now master of himself and of his ship, and all\ndanger at an end. And then, sudden as a trick change upon the stage, the\nsquall blew by, the wind dropped into light airs, the sun beamed forth\nagain upon the tattered schooner; and the captain, having secured the\nforesail boom and set a couple of hands to the pump, walked aft, sober,\na little pale, and with the sodden end of a cigar still stuck between\nhis teeth even as the squall had found it. Herrick followed him; he\ncould scarce recall the violence of his late emotions, but he felt\nthere was a scene to go through, and he was anxious and even eager to go\nthrough with it.\n\nThe captain, turning at the house end, met him face to face, and averted\nhis eyes. 'We've lost the two tops'ls and the stays'l,' he gabbled.\n'Good business, we didn't lose any sticks. I guess you think we're all\nthe better without the kites.'\n\n'That's not what I'm thinking,' said Herrick, in a voice strangely\nquiet, that yet echoed confusion in the captain's mind.\n\n'I know that,' he cried, holding up his hand. 'I know what you're\nthinking. No use to say it now. I'm sober.'\n\n'I have to say it, though,' returned Herrick.\n\n'Hold on, Herrick; you've said enough,' said Davis. 'You've said what I\nwould take from no man breathing but yourself; only I know it's true.'\n\n'I have to tell you, Captain Brown,' pursued Herrick, 'that I resign my\nposition as mate. You can put me in irons or shoot me, as you please; I\nwill make no resistance--only, I decline in any way to help or to obey\nyou; and I suggest you should put Mr Huish in my place. He will make a\nworthy first officer to your captain, sir.' He smiled, bowed, and turned\nto walk forward.\n\n'Where are you going, Herrick?' cried the captain, detaining him by the\nshoulder.\n\n'To berth forward with the men, sir,' replied Herrick, with the same\nhateful smile. 'I've been long enough aft here with you--gentlemen.\n\n'You're wrong there,' said Davis. 'Don't you be too quick with me; there\nain't nothing wrong but the drink--it's the old story, man! Let me get\nsober once, and then you'll see,' he pleaded.\n\n'Excuse me, I desire to see no more of you,' said Herrick.\n\nThe captain groaned aloud. 'You know what you said about my children?'\nhe broke out.\n\n'By rote. In case you wish me to say it you again?' asked Herrick.\n\n'Don't!' cried the captain, clapping his hands to his ears. 'Don't make\nme kill a man I care for! Herrick, if you see me put glass to my lips\nagain till we're ashore, I give you leave to put bullet through me;\nI beg you to do it! You're the only man aboard whose carcase is worth\nlosing; do you think I don't know that? do you think I ever went back on\nyou? I always knew you were in the right of it--drunk or sober, I knew\nthat. What do you want?--an oath? Man, you're clever enough to see that\nthis is sure-enough earnest.'\n\n'Do you mean there shall be no more drinking?' asked Herrick, 'neither\nby you nor Huish? that you won't go on stealing my profits and drinking\nmy champagne that I gave my honour for? and that you'll attend to your\nduties, and stand watch and watch, and bear your proper share of the\nship's work, instead of leaving it all on the shoulders of a landsman,\nand making yourself the butt and scoff of native seamen? Is that what\nyou mean? If it is, be so good as to say it categorically.'\n\n'You put these things in a way hard for a gentleman to swallow,' said\nthe captain. 'You wouldn't have me say I was ashamed of myself? Trust me\nthis once; I'll do the square thing, and there's my hand on it.'\n\n'Well, I'll try it once,' said Herrick. 'Fail me again...'\n\n'No more now!' interrupted Davis. 'No more, old man! Enough said. You've\na riling tongue when your back's up, Herrick. Just be glad we're friends\nagain, the same as what I am; and go tender on the raws; I'll see as you\ndon't repent it. We've been mighty near death this day--don't say whose\nfault it was!--pretty near hell, too, I guess. We're in a mighty bad\nline of life, us two, and ought to go easy with each other.'\n\nHe was maundering; yet it seemed as if he were maundering with some\ndesign, beating about the bush of some communication that he feared to\nmake, or perhaps only talking against time in terror of what Herrick\nmight say next. But Herrick had now spat his venom; his was a kindly\nnature, and, content with his triumph, he had now begun to pity. With\na few soothing words, he sought to conclude the interview, and proposed\nthat they should change their clothes.\n\n'Not right yet,' said Davis. 'There's another thing I want to tell you\nfirst. You know what you said about my children? I want to tell you why\nit hit me so hard; I kind of think you'll feel bad about it too. It's\nabout my little Adar. You hadn't ought to have quite said that--but of\ncourse I know you didn't know. She--she's dead, you see.'\n\n'Why, Davis!' cried Herrick. 'You've told me a dozen times she was\nalive! Clear your head, man! This must be the drink.'\n\n'No, SIR,' said Davis. 'She's dead. Died of a bowel complaint. That was\nwhen I was away in the brig Oregon. She lies in Portland, Maine. \"Adar,\nonly daughter of Captain John Davis and Mariar his wife, aged five.\"\nI had a doll for her on board. I never took the paper off'n that doll,\nHerrick; it went down the way it was with the Sea Ranger, that day I was\ndamned.'\n\nThe Captain's eyes were fixed on the horizon, he talked with an\nextraordinary softness but a complete composure; and Herrick looked upon\nhim with something that was almost terror.\n\n'Don't think I'm crazy neither,' resumed Davis. 'I've all the cold sense\nthat I know what to do with. But I guess a man that's unhappy's like a\nchild; and this is a kind of a child's game of mine. I never could act\nup to the plain-cut truth, you see; so I pretend. And I warn you square;\nas soon as we're through with this talk, I'll start in again with\nthe pretending. Only, you see, she can't walk no streets,' added the\ncaptain, 'couldn't even make out to live and get that doll!'\n\nHerrick laid a tremulous hand upon the captain's shoulder.\n\n'Don't do that,' cried Davis, recoiling from the touch. 'Can't you see\nI'm all broken up the way it is? Come along, then; come along, old\nman; you can put your trust in me right through; come along and get dry\nclothes.'\n\nThey entered the cabin, and there was Huish on his knees prising open a\ncase of champagne.\n\n''Vast, there!' cried the captain. 'No more of that. No more drinking on\nthis ship.'\n\n'Turned teetotal, 'ave you?' inquired Hu'sh. 'I'm agreeable. About time,\neh? Bloomin' nearly lost another ship, I fancy.' He took out a bottle\nand began calmly to burst the wire with the spike of a corkscrew.\n\n'Do you hear me speak?' cried Davis.\n\n'I suppose I do. You speak loud enough,' said Huish. 'The trouble is\nthat I don't care.'\n\nHerrick plucked the captain's sleeve. 'Let him free now,' he said.\n'We've had all we want this morning.'\n\n'Let him have it then,' said the captain. 'It's his last.'\n\nBy this time the wire was open, the string was cut, the head of glided\npaper was torn away; and Huish waited, mug in hand, expecting the usual\nexplosion. It did not follow. He eased the cork with his thumb; still\nthere was no result. At last he took the screw and drew it. It came out\nvery easy and with scarce a sound.\n\n''Illo!'said Huish. ''Ere's a bad bottle.'\n\nHe poured some of the wine into the mug; it was colourless and still. He\nsmelt and tasted it.\n\n'W'y, wot's this?' he said. 'It's water!'\n\nIf the voice of trumpets had suddenly sounded about the ship in the\nmidst of the sea, the three men in the house could scarcely have been\nmore stunned than by this incident. The mug passed round; each sipped,\neach smelt of it; each stared at the bottle in its glory of gold paper\nas Crusoe may have stared at the footprint; and their minds were swift\nto fix upon a common apprehension. The difference between a bottle of\nchampagne and a bottle of water is not great; between a shipload of one\nor the other lay the whole scale from riches to ruin.\n\nA second bottle was broached. There were two cases standing ready in a\nstateroom; these two were brought out, broken open, and tested. Still\nwith the same result: the contents were still colourless and tasteless,\nand dead as the rain in a beached fishing-boat.\n\n'Crikey!' said Huish.\n\n'Here, let's sample the hold!' said the captain, mopping his brow with\na back-handed sweep; and the three stalked out of the house, grim and\nheavy-footed.\n\nAll hands were turned out; two Kanakas were sent below, another\nstationed at a purchase; and Davis, axe in hand, took his place beside\nthe coamings.\n\n'Are you going to let the men know?' whispered Herrick.\n\n'Damn the men!' said Davis. 'It's beyond that. We've got to know\nourselves.'\n\nThree cases were sent on deck and sampled in turn; from each bottle,\nas the captain smashed it with the axe, the champagne ran bubbling and\ncreaming.\n\n'Go deeper, can't you?' cried Davis to the Kanakas in the hold.\n\nThe command gave the signal for a disastrous change. Case after case\ncame up, bottle after bottle was burst and bled mere water. Deeper\nyet, and they came upon a layer where there was scarcely so much as\nthe intention to deceive; where the cases were no longer branded, the\nbottles no longer wired or papered, where the fraud was manifest and\nstared them in the face.\n\n'Here's about enough of this foolery!' said Davis. 'Stow back the cases\nin the hold, Uncle, and get the broken crockery overboard. Come with\nme,' he added to his co-adventurers, and led the way back into the\ncabin.\n\n\n\nChapter 6. THE PARTNERS\n\nEach took a side of the fixed table; it was the first time they had sat\ndown at it together; but now all sense of incongruity, all memory of\ndifferences, was quite swept away by the presence of the common ruin.\n\n'Gentlemen,' said the captain, after a pause, and with very much the air\nof a chairman opening a board-meeting, 'we're sold.'\n\nHuish broke out in laughter. 'Well, if this ain't the 'ighest old rig!'\nhe cried. 'And Dyvis, 'ere, who thought he had got up so bloomin' early\nin the mornin'! We've stolen a cargo of spring water! Oh, my crikey!'\nand he squirmed with mirth.\n\nThe captain managed to screw out a phantom smile.\n\n'Here's Old Man Destiny again,' said he to Herrick, 'but this time I\nguess he's kicked the door right in.'\n\nHerrick only shook his head.\n\n'O Lord, it's rich!' laughed Huish. 'It would really be a scrumptious\nlark if it 'ad 'appened to somebody else! And wot are we to do next? Oh,\nmy eye! with this bloomin' schooner, too?'\n\n'That's the trouble,' said Davis. 'There's only one thing certain: it's\nno use carting this old glass and ballast to Peru. No, SIR, we're in a\nhole.'\n\n'O my, and the merchand' cried Huish; 'the man that made this shipment!\nHe'll get the news by the mail brigantine; and he'll think of course\nwe're making straight for Sydney.'\n\n'Yes, he'll be a sick merchant,' said the captain. 'One thing: this\nexplains the Kanaka crew. If you're going to lose a ship, I would ask\nno better myself than a Kanaka crew. But there's one thing it don't\nexplain; it don't explain why she came down Tahiti ways.'\n\n'Wy, to lose her, you byby!' said Huish.\n\n'A lot you know,' said the captain. 'Nobody wants to lose a schooner;\nthey want to lose her ON HER COURSE, you skeericks! You seem to think\nunderwriters haven't got enough sense to come in out of the rain.'\n\n'Well,' said Herrick, 'I can tell you (I am afraid) why she came so\nfar to the eastward. I had it of Uncle Ned. It seems these two unhappy\ndevils, Wiseman and Wishart, were drunk on the champagne from the\nbeginning--and died drunk at the end.'\n\nThe captain looked on the table.\n\n'They lay in their two bunks, or sat here in this damned house,' he\npursued, with rising agitation, 'filling their skins with the accursed\nstuff, till sickness took them. As they sickened and the fever rose,\nthey drank the more. They lay here howling and groaning, drunk and\ndying, all in one. They didn't know where they were, they didn't care.\nThey didn't even take the sun, it seems.'\n\n'Not take the sun?' cried the captain, looking up. 'Sacred Billy! what a\ncrowd!'\n\n'Well, it don't matter to Joe!' said Huish. 'Wot are Wiseman and the\nt'other buffer to us?'\n\n'A good deal, too,' says the captain. 'We're their heirs, I guess.'\n\n'It is a great inheritance,' said Herrick.\n\n'Well, I don't know about that,' returned Davis. 'Appears to me as if it\nmight be worse. 'Tain't worth what the cargo would have been of course,\nat least not money down. But I'll tell you what it appears to figure up\nto. Appears to me as if it amounted to about the bottom dollar of the\nman in 'Frisco.'\n\n''Old on,' said Huish. 'Give a fellow time; 'ow's this, umpire?'\n\n'Well, my sons,' pursued the captain, who seemed to have recovered his\nassurance, 'Wiseman and Wishart were to be paid for casting away this\nold schooner and its cargo. We're going to cast away the schooner right\nenough; and I'll make it my private business to see that we get paid.\nWhat were W. and W. to get? That's more'n I can tell. But W. and W. went\ninto this business themselves, they were on the crook. Now WE'RE on\nthe square, we only stumbled into it; and that merchant has just got to\nsqueal, and I'm the man to see that he squeals good. No, sir! there's\nsome stuffing to this Farallone racket after all.'\n\n'Go it, cap!' cried Huish. 'Yoicks! Forrard! 'Old 'ard! There's your\nstyle for the money! Blow me if I don't prefer this to the hother.'\n\n'I do not understand,' said Herrick. 'I have to ask you to excuse me; I\ndo not understand.'\n\n'Well now, see here, Herrick,' said Davis, 'I'm going to have a word\nwith you anyway upon a different matter, and it's good that Huish should\nhear it too. We're done with this boozing business, and we ask your\npardon for it right here and now. We have to thank you for all you did\nfor us while we were making hogs of ourselves; you'll find me turn-to\nall right in future; and as for the wine, which I grant we stole from\nyou, I'll take stock and see you paid for it. That's good enough, I\nbelieve. But what I want to point out to you is this. The old game was\na risky game. The new game's as safe as running a Vienna Bakery. We just\nput this Farallone before the wind, and run till we're well to looard\nof our port of departure and reasonably well up with some other place,\nwhere they have an American Consul. Down goes the Farallone, and\ngood-bye to her! A day or so in the boat; the consul packs us home,\nat Uncle Sam's expense, to 'Frisco; and if that merchant don't put the\ndollars down, you come to me!'\n\n'But I thought,' began Herrick; and then broke out; 'oh, let's get on to\nPeru!'\n\n'Well, if you're going to Peru for your health, I won't say no!'\nreplied the captain. 'But for what other blame' shadow of a reason you\nshould want to go there, gets me clear. We don't want to go there with\nthis cargo; I don't know as old bottles is a lively article anywheres;\nleastways, I'll go my bottom cent, it ain't Peru. It was always a doubt\nif we could sell the schooner; I never rightly hoped to, and now I'm\nsure she ain't worth a hill of beans; what's wrong with her, I don't\nknow; I only know it's something, or she wouldn't be here with this\ntruck in her inside. Then again, if we lose her, and land in Peru, where\nare we? We can't declare the loss, or how did we get to Peru? In that\ncase the merchant can't touch the insurance; most likely he'll go bust;\nand don't you think you see the three of us on the beach of Callao?'\n\n'There's no extradition there,' said Herrick.\n\n'Well, my son, and we want to be extraded,' said the captain.\n\n'What's our point? We want to have a consul extrade us as far as San\nFrancisco and that merchant's office door. My idea is that Samoa would\nbe found an eligible business centre. It's dead before the wind; the\nStates have a consul there, and 'Frisco steamers call, so's we could\nskip right back and interview the merchant.'\n\n'Samoa?' said Herrick. 'It will take us for ever to get there.'\n\n'Oh, with a fair wind!' said the captain.\n\n'No trouble about the log, eh?' asked Huish.\n\n'No, SIR,' said Davis. 'Light airs and baffling winds. Squalls and\ncalms. D. R.: five miles. No obs. Pumps attended. And fill in the\nbarometer and thermometer off of last year's trip.' 'Never saw such a\nvoyage,' says you to the consul. 'Thought I was going to run short...'\nHe stopped in mid career. 'Say,' he began again, and once more stopped.\n'Beg your pardon, Herrick,' he added with undisguised humility, 'but did\nyou keep the run of the stores?'\n\n'Had I been told to do so, it should have been done, as the rest was\ndone, to the best of my little ability,' said Herrick. 'As it was, the\ncook helped himself to what he pleased.'\n\nDavis looked at the table.\n\n'I drew it rather fine, you see,' he said at last. 'The great thing was\nto clear right out of Papeete before the consul could think better of\nit. Tell you what: I guess I'll take stock.'\n\nAnd he rose from table and disappeared with a lamp in the lazarette.\n\n''Ere's another screw loose,' observed Huish.\n\n'My man,' said Herrick, with a sudden gleam of animosity, 'it is still\nyour watch on deck, and surely your wheel also?'\n\n'You come the 'eavy swell, don't you, ducky?' said Huish.\n\n'Stand away from that binnacle. Surely your w'eel, my man. Yah.'\n\nHe lit a cigar ostentatiously, and strolled into the waist with his\nhands in his pockets.\n\nIn a surprisingly short time, the captain reappeared; he did not look at\nHerrick, but called Huish back and sat down.\n\n'Well,' he began, 'I've taken stock--roughly.' He paused as if for\nsomebody to help him out; and none doing so, both gazing on him instead\nwith manifest anxiety, he yet more heavily resumed. 'Well, it won't\nfight. We can't do it; that's the bed rock. I'm as sorry as what you can\nbe, and sorrier. We can't look near Samoa. I don't know as we could get\nto Peru.'\n\n'Wot-ju mean?' asked Huish brutally.\n\n'I can't 'most tell myself,' replied the captain. 'I drew it fine; I\nsaid I did; but what's been going on here gets me! Appears as if the\ndevil had been around. That cook must be the holiest kind of fraud. Only\ntwelve days, too! Seems like craziness. I'll own up square to one thing:\nI seem to have figured too fine upon the flour. But the rest--my land!\nI'll never understand it! There's been more waste on this twopenny\nship than what there is to an Atlantic Liner.' He stole a glance at his\ncompanions; nothing good was to be gleaned from their dark faces; and he\nhad recourse to rage. 'You wait till I interview that cook!' he roared\nand smote the table with his fist. 'I'll interview the son of a gun so's\nhe's never been spoken to before. I'll put a bead upon the--'\n\n'You will not lay a finger on the man,' said Herrick. 'The fault is\nyours and you know it. If you turn a savage loose in your store-room,\nyou know what to expect. I will not allow the man to be molested.'\n\nIt is hard to say how Davis might have taken this defiance; but he was\ndiverted to a fresh assailant.\n\n'Well!' drawled Huish, 'you're a plummy captain, ain't you? You're a\nblooming captain! Don't you, set up any of your chat to me, John Dyvis:\nI know you now, you ain't any more use than a bloomin' dawl! Oh, you\n\"don't know\", don't you? Oh, it \"gets you\", do it? Oh, I dessay! W'y,\nwe en't you 'owling for fresh tins every blessed day? 'Ow often 'ave I\n'eard you send the 'ole bloomin' dinner off and tell the man to chuck it\nin the swill tub? And breakfast? Oh, my crikey! breakfast for ten, and\nyou 'ollerin' for more! And now you \"can't 'most tell\"! Blow me, if it\nain't enough to make a man write an insultin' letter to Gawd! You dror\nit mild, John Dyvis; don't 'andle me; I'm dyngerous.'\n\nDavis sat like one bemused; it might even have been doubted if he heard,\nbut the voice of the clerk rang about the cabin like that of a cormorant\namong the ledges of the cliff.\n\n'That will do, Huish,' said Herrick.\n\n'Oh, so you tyke his part, do you? you stuck-up sneerin' snob! Tyke it\nthen. Come on, the pair of you. But as for John Dyvis, let him look out!\nHe struck me the first night aboard, and I never took a blow yet but\nwot I gave as good. Let him knuckle down on his marrow bones and beg my\npardon. That's my last word.'\n\n'I stand by the Captain,' said Herrick. 'That makes us two to one, both\ngood men; and the crew will all follow me. I hope I shall die very soon;\nbut I have not the least objection to killing you before I go. I should\nprefer it so; I should do it with no more remorse than winking. Take\ncare--take care, you little cad!'\n\nThe animosity with which these words were uttered was so marked in\nitself, and so remarkable in the man who uttered them that Huish stared,\nand even the humiliated Davis reared up his head and gazed at his\ndefender. As for Herrick, the successive agitations and disappointments\nof the day had left him wholly reckless; he was conscious of a pleasant\nglow, an agreeable excitement; his head seemed empty, his eyeballs\nburned as he turned them, his throat was dry as a biscuit; the least\ndangerous man by nature, except in so far as the weak are always\ndangerous, at that moment he was ready to slay or to be slain with equal\nunconcern.\n\nHere at least was the gage thrown down, and battle offered; he who\nshould speak next would bring the matter to an issue there and then; all\nknew it to be so and hung back; and for many seconds by the cabin clock,\nthe trio sat motionless and silent.\n\nThen came an interruption, welcome as the flowers in May.\n\n'Land ho!' sang out a voice on deck. 'Land a weatha bow!'\n\n'Land!' cried Davis, springing to his feet. 'What's this? There ain't no\nland here.'\n\nAnd as men may run from the chamber of a murdered corpse, the three ran\nforth out of the house and left their quarrel behind them, undecided.\n\nThe sky shaded down at the sea level to the white of opals; the sea\nitself, insolently, inkily blue, drew all about them the uncompromising\nwheel of the horizon. Search it as they pleased, not even the practisect\neye of Captain Davis could descry the smallest interruption. A few filmy\nclouds were slowly melting overhead; and about the schooner, as around\nthe only point of interest, a tropic bird, white as a snowflake, hung,\nand circled, and displayed, as it turned, the long vermilion feather of\nits tall. Save the sea and the heaven, that was all.\n\n'Who sang out land?' asked Davis. 'If there's any boy playing funny dog\nwith me, I'll teach him skylarking!'\n\nBut Uncle Ned contentedly pointed to a part of the horizon, where a\ngreenish, filmy iridescence could be discerned floating like smoke on\nthe pale heavens.\n\nDavis applied his glass to it, and then looked at the Kanaka. 'Call that\nland?' said he. 'Well, it's more than I do.'\n\n'One time long ago,' said Uncle Ned, 'I see Anaa all-e-same that, four\nfive hours befo' we come up. Capena he say sun go down, sun go up again;\nhe say lagoon all-e-same milla.'\n\n'All-e-same WHAT?' asked Davis.\n\n'Milla, sah,' said Uncle Ned.\n\n'Oh, ah! mirror,' said Davis. 'I see; reflection from the lagoon. Well,\nyou know, it is just possible, though it's strange I never heard of it.\nHere, let's look at the chart.'\n\nThey went back to the cabin, and found the position of the schooner well\nto windward of the archipelago in the midst of a white field of paper.\n\n'There! you see for yourselves,' said Davis.\n\n'And yet I don't know,' said Herrick, 'I somehow think there's something\nin it. I'll tell you one thing too, captain; that's all right about the\nreflection; I heard it in Papeete.'\n\n'Fetch up that Findlay, then!' said Davis. 'I'll try it all ways. An\nisland wouldn't come amiss, the way we're fixed.'\n\nThe bulky volume was handed up to him, broken-backed as is the way with\nFindlay; and he turned to the place and began to run over the text,\nmuttering to himself and turning over the pages with a wetted finger.\n\n'Hullo!' he exclaimed. 'How's this?' And he read aloud. 'New Island.\nAccording to M. Delille this island, which from private interests would\nremain unknown, lies, it is said, in lat. 12 degrees 49' 10\" S. long.\n113 degrees 6' W. In addition to the position above given Commander\nMatthews, H.M.S. Scorpion, states that an island exists in lat. 12\ndegrees 0' S. long. 13 degrees 16' W. This must be the same, if such\nan island exists, which is very doubtful, and totally disbelieved in by\nSouth Sea traders.'\n\n'Golly!' said Huish.\n\n'It's rather in the conditional mood,' said Herrick.\n\n'It's anything you please,' cried Davis, 'only there it is! That's our\nplace, and don't you make any mistake.'\n\n\"'Which from private interests would remain unknown,\"' read Herrick,\nover his shoulder. 'What may that mean?'\n\n'It should mean pearls,' said Davis. 'A pearling island the government\ndon't know about? That sounds like real estate. Or suppose it don't mean\nanything. Suppose it's just an island; I guess we could fill up with\nfish, and cocoanuts, and native stuff, and carry out the Samoa scheme\nhand over fist. How long did he say it was before they raised Anaa? Five\nhours, I think?'\n\n'Four or five,' said Herrick.\n\nDavis stepped to the door. 'What breeze had you that time you made Anaa,\nUncle Ned?' said he.\n\n'Six or seven knots,' was the reply.\n\n'Thirty or thirty-five miles,' said Davis. 'High time we were shortening\nsail, then. If it is an island, we don't want to be butting our head\nagainst it in the dark; and if it isn't an island, we can get through it\njust as well by daylight. Ready about!' he roared.\n\nAnd the schooner's head was laid for that elusive glimmer in the sky,\nwhich began already to pale in lustre and diminish in size, as the stain\nof breath vanishes from a window pane. At the same time she was reefed\nclose down.\n\n\n\nPart II\n\nTHE QUARTETTE\n\nChapter 7. THE PEARL-FISHER\n\nAbout four in the morning, as the captain and Herrick sat together on\nthe rail, there arose from the midst of the night in front of them the\nvoice of breakers. Each sprang to his feet and stared and listened. The\nsound was continuous, like the passing of a train; no rise or fall\ncould be distinguished; minute by minute the ocean heaved with an equal\npotency against the invisible isle; and as time passed, and Herrick\nwaited in vain for any vicissitude in the volume of that roaring, a\nsense of the eternal weighed upon his mind. To the expert eye the isle\nitself was to be inferred from a certain string of blots along the\nstarry heaven. And the schooner was laid to and anxiously observed till\ndaylight.\n\nThere was little or no morning bank. A brightening came in the east;\nthen a wash of some ineffable, faint, nameless hue between crimson and\nsilver; and then coals of fire. These glimmered a while on the sea line,\nand seemed to brighten and darken and spread out, and still the night\nand the stars reigned undisturbed; it was as though a spark should\ncatch and glow and creep along the foot of some heavy and almost\nincombustible wall-hanging, and the room itself be scarce menaced. Yet\na little after, and the whole east glowed with gold and scarlet, and the\nhollow of heaven was filled with the daylight.\n\nThe isle--the undiscovered, the scarce believed-in--now lay before them\nand close aboard; and Herrick thought that never in his dreams had he\nbeheld anything more strange and delicate. The beach was excellently\nwhite, the continuous barrier of trees inimitably green; the land\nperhaps ten feet high, the trees thirty more. Every here and there, as\nthe schooner coasted northward, the wood was intermitted; and he could\nsee clear over the inconsiderable strip of land (as a man looks over a\nwall) to the lagoon within--and clear over that again to where the far\nside of the atoll prolonged its pencilling of trees against the morning\nsky. He tortured himself to find analogies. The isle was like the rim\nof a great vessel sunken in the waters; it was like the embankment of\nan annular railway grown upon with wood: so slender it seemed amidst the\noutrageous breakers, so frail and pretty, he would scarce have wondered\nto see it sink and disappear without a sound, and the waves close\nsmoothly over its descent.\n\nMeanwhile the captain was in the forecross-trees, glass in hand, his\neyes in every quarter, spying for an entrance, spying for signs of\ntenancy. But the isle continued to unfold itself in joints, and to run\nout in indeterminate capes, and still there was neither house nor\nman, nor the smoke of fire. Here a multitude of sea-birds soared and\ntwinkled, and fished in the blue waters; and there, and for miles\ntogether, the fringe of cocoa-palm and pandanus extended desolate, and\nmade desirable green bowers for nobody to visit, and the silence of\ndeath was only broken by the throbbing of the sea.\n\nThe airs were very light, their speed was small; the heat intense. The\ndecks were scorching underfoot, the sun flamed overhead, brazen, out\nof a brazen sky; the pitch bubbled in the seams, and the brains in the\nbrain-pan. And all the while the excitement of the three adventurers\nglowed about their bones like a fever. They whispered, and nodded, and\npointed, and put mouth to ear, with a singular instinct of secrecy,\napproaching that island underhand like eavesdroppers and thieves; and\neven Davis from the cross-trees gave his orders mostly by gestures. The\nhands shared in this mute strain, like dogs, without comprehending it;\nand through the roar of so many miles of breakers, it was a silent ship\nthat approached an empty island.\n\nAt last they drew near to the break in that interminable gangway. A spur\nof coral sand stood forth on the one hand; on the other a high and thick\ntuft of trees cut off the view; between was the mouth of the huge laver.\nTwice a day the ocean crowded in that narrow entrance and was heaped\nbetween these frail walls; twice a day, with the return of the ebb, the\nmighty surplusage of water must struggle to escape. The hour in which\nthe Farallone came there was the hour of flood. The sea turned (as\nwith the instinct of the homing pigeon) for the vast receptacle, swept\neddying through the gates, was transmuted, as it did so, into a wonder\nof watery and silken hues, and brimmed into the inland sea beyond. The\nschooner looked up close-hauled, and was caught and carried away by the\ninflux like a toy. She skimmed; she flew; a momentary shadow touched her\ndecks from the shore-side trees; the bottom of the channel showed up for\na moment and was in a moment gone; the next, she floated on the bosom of\nthe lagoon, and below, in the transparent chamber of waters, a myriad\nof many-coloured fishes were sporting, a myriad pale-flowers of coral\ndiversified the floor.\n\nHerrick stood transported. In the gratified lust of his eye, he forgot\nthe past and the present; forgot that he was menaced by a prison on the\none hand and starvation on the other; forgot that he was come to that\nisland, desperately foraging, clutching at expedients. A drove of\nfishes, painted like the rainbow and billed like parrots, hovered up in\nthe shadow of the schooner, and passed clear of it, and glinted in the\nsubmarine sun. They were beautiful, like birds, and their silent passage\nimpressed him like a strain of song.\n\nMeanwhile, to the eye of Davis in the cross-trees, the lagoon continued\nto expand its empty waters, and the long succession of the shore-side\ntrees to be paid out like fishing line off a reel. And still there was\nno mark of habitation. The schooner, immediately on entering, had been\nkept away to the nor'ard where the water seemed to be the most deep; and\nshe was now skimming past the tall grove of trees, which stood on that\nside of the channel and denied further view. Of the whole of the low\nshores of the island, only this bight remained to be revealed. And\nsuddenly the curtain was raised; they began to open out a haven, snugly\nelbowed there, and beheld, with an astonishment beyond words, the roofs\nof men.\n\nThe appearance, thus 'instantaneously disclosed' to those on the deck of\nthe Farallone, was not that of a city, rather of a substantial country\nfarm with its attendant hamlet: a long line of sheds and store-houses;\napart, upon the one side, a deep-verandah'ed dwelling-house; on the\nother, perhaps a dozen native huts; a building with a belfry and some\nrude offer at architectural features that might be thought to mark it\nout for a chapel; on the beach in front some heavy boats drawn up, and\na pile of timber running forth into the burning shallows of the\nlagoon. From a flagstaff at the pierhead, the red ensign of England was\ndisplayed. Behind, about, and over, the same tall grove of palms,\nwhich had masked the settlement in the beginning, prolonged its root\nof tumultuous green fans, and turned and ruffled overhead, and sang its\nsilver song all day in the wind. The place had the indescribable but\nunmistakable appearance of being in commission; yet there breathed from\nit a sense of desertion that was almost poignant, no human figure was to\nbe observed going to and fro about the houses, and there was no sound of\nhuman industry or enjoyment. Only, on the top of the beach and hard by\nthe flagstaff, a woman of exorbitant stature and as white as snow was to\nbe seen beckoning with uplifted arm. The second glance identified her\nas a piece of naval sculpture, the figure-head of a ship that had long\nhovered and plunged into so many running billows, and was now brought\nashore to be the ensign and presiding genius of that empty town.\n\nThe Farallone made a soldier's breeze of it; the wind, besides, was\nstronger inside than without under the lee of the land; and the stolen\nschooner opened out successive objects with the swiftness of a panorama,\nso that the adventurers stood speechless. The flag spoke for itself; it\nwas no frayed and weathered trophy that had beaten itself to pieces on\nthe post, flying over desolation; and to make assurance stronger, there\nwas to be descried in the deep shade of the verandah, a glitter of\ncrystal and the fluttering of white napery. If the figure-head at the\npier end, with its perpetual gesture and its leprous whiteness, reigned\nalone in that hamlet as it seemed to do, it would not have reigned long.\nMen's hands had been busy, men's feet stirring there, within the circuit\nof the clock. The Farallones were sure of it; their eyes dug in the deep\nshadow of the palms for some one hiding; if intensity of looking might\nhave prevailed, they would have pierced the walls of houses; and there\ncame to them, in these pregnant seconds, a sense of being watched and\nplayed with, and of a blow impending, that was hardly bearable.\n\nThe extreme point of palms they had just passed enclosed a creek, which\nwas thus hidden up to the last moment from the eyes of those on board;\nand from this, a boat put suddenly and briskly out, and a voice hailed.\n\n'Schooner ahoy!' it cried. 'Stand in for the pier! In two cables'\nlengths you'll have twenty fathoms water and good holding ground.'\n\nThe boat was manned with a couple of brown oarsmen in scanty kilts of\nblue. The speaker, who was steering, wore white clothes, the full dress\nof the tropics; a wide hat shaded his face; but it could be seen that he\nwas of stalwart size, and his voice sounded like a gentleman's. So much\ncould be made out. It was plain, besides, that the Farallone had been\ndescried some time before at sea, and the inhabitants were prepared for\nits reception.\n\nMechanically the orders were obeyed, and the ship berthed; and the three\nadventurers gathered aft beside the house and waited, with galloping\npulses and a perfect vacancy of mind, the coming of the stranger who\nmight mean so much to them. They had no plan, no story prepared; there\nwas no time to make one; they were caught red-handed and must stand\ntheir chance. Yet this anxiety was chequered with hope. The island being\nundeclared, it was not possible the man could hold any office or be in a\nposition to demand their papers. And beyond that, if there was any truth\nin Findlay, as it now seemed there should be, he was the representative\nof the 'private reasons,' he must see their coming with a profound\ndisappointment; and perhaps (hope whispered) he would be willing and\nable to purchase their silence.\n\nThe boat was by that time forging alongside, and they were able at last\nto see what manner of man they had to do with. He was a huge fellow,\nsix feet four in height, and of a build proportionately strong, but\nhis sinews seemed to be dissolved in a listlessness that was more than\nlanguor. It was only the eye that corrected this impression; an eye\nof an unusual mingled brilliancy and softness, sombre as coal and\nwith lights that outshone the topaz; an eye of unimpaired health and\nvirility; an eye that bid you beware of the man's devastating anger.\nA complexion, naturally dark, had been tanned in the island to a hue\nhardly distinguishable from that of a Tahitian; only his manners and\nmovements, and the living force that dwelt in him, like fire in flint,\nbetrayed the European. He was dressed in white drill, exquisitely made;\nhis scarf and tie were of tender-coloured silks; on the thwart beside\nhim there leaned a Winchester rifle.\n\n'Is the doctor on board?' he cried as he came up. 'Dr Symonds, I mean?\nYou never heard of him? Nor yet of the Trinity Hall? Ah!'\n\nHe did not look surprised, seemed rather to affect it in politeness;\nbut his eye rested on each of the three white men in succession with a\nsudden weight of curiosity that was almost savage. 'Ah, THEN!' said he,\n'there is some small mistake, no doubt, and I must ask you to what I am\nindebted for this pleasure?'\n\nHe was by this time on the deck, but he had the art to be quite\nunapproachable; the friendliest vulgarian, three parts drunk, would have\nknown better than take liberties; and not one of the adventurers so much\nas offered to shake hands.\n\n'Well,' said Davis, 'I suppose you may call it an accident. We had heard\nof your island, and read that thing in the Directory about the PRIVATE\nREASONS, you see; so when we saw the lagoon reflected in the sky, we put\nher head for it at once, and so here we are.'\n\n''Ope we don't intrude!' said Huish.\n\nThe stranger looked at Huish with an air of faint surprise, and looked\npointedly away again. It was hard to be more offensive in dumb show.\n\n'It may suit me, your coming here,' he said. 'My own schooner is\noverdue, and I may put something in your way in the meantime. Are you\nopen to a charter?'\n\n'Well, I guess so,' said Davis; 'it depends.'\n\n'My name is Attwater,' continued the stranger. 'You, I presume, are the\ncaptain?'\n\n'Yes, sir. I am the captain of this ship: Captain Brown,' was the reply.\n\n'Well, see 'ere!' said Huish, 'better begin fair! 'E's skipper on deck\nright enough, but not below. Below, we're all equal, all got a lay in\nthe adventure; when it comes to business, I'm as good as 'e; and what I\nsay is, let's go into the 'ouse and have a lush, and talk it over among\npals. We've some prime fizz,' he said, and winked.\n\nThe presence of the gentleman lighted up like a candle the vulgarity of\nthe clerk; and Herrick instinctively, as one shields himself from pain,\nmade haste to interrupt.\n\n'My name is Hay,' said he, 'since introductions are going. We shall be\nvery glad if you will step inside.'\n\nAttwater leaned to him swiftly. 'University man?' said he.\n\n'Yes, Merton,' said Herrick, and the next moment blushed scarlet at his\nindiscretion.\n\n'I am of the other lot,' said Attwater: 'Trinity Hall, Cambridge. I\ncalled my schooner after the old shop. Well! this is a queer place and\ncompany for us to meet in, Mr Hay,' he pursued, with easy incivility to\nthe others. 'But do you bear out ... I beg this gentleman's pardon, I\nreally did not catch his name.'\n\n'My name is 'Uish, sir,' returned the clerk, and blushed in turn.\n\n'Ah!' said Attwater. And then turning again to Herrick, 'Do you bear out\nMr Whish's description of your vintage? or was it only the unaffected\npoetry of his own nature bubbling up?'\n\nHerrick was embarrassed; the silken brutality of their visitor made\nhim blush; that he should be accepted as an equal, and the others thus\npointedly ignored, pleased him in spite of himself, and then ran through\nhis veins in a recoil of anger.\n\n'I don't know,' he said. 'It's only California; it's good enough, I\nbelieve.'\n\nAttwater seemed to make up his mind. 'Well then, I'll tell you what: you\nthree gentlemen come ashore this evening and bring a basket of wine with\nyou; I'll try and find the food,' he said. 'And by the by, here is a\nquestion I should have asked you when I come on board: have you had\nsmallpox?'\n\n'Personally, no,' said Herrick. 'But the schooner had it.'\n\n'Deaths?' from Attwater.\n\n'Two,' said Herrick.\n\n'Well, it is a dreadful sickness,' said Attwater.\n\n''Ad you any deaths?' asked Huish, ''ere on the island?'\n\n'Twenty-nine,' said Attwater. 'Twenty-nine deaths and thirty-one cases,\nout of thirty-three souls upon the island.--That's a strange way to\ncalculate, Mr Hay, is it not? Souls! I never say it but it startles me.'\n\n'Oh, so that's why everything's deserted?' said Huish.\n\n'That is why, Mr Whish,' said Attwater; 'that is why the house is empty\nand the graveyard full.'\n\n'Twenty-nine out of thirty-three!' exclaimed Herrick, 'Why, when it came\nto burying--or did you bother burying?'\n\n'Scarcely,' said Attwater; 'or there was one day at least when we gave\nup. There were five of the dead that morning, and thirteen of the dying,\nand no one able to go about except the sexton and myself. We held a\ncouncil of war, took the... empty bottles... into the lagoon, and buried\nthem.' He looked over his shoulder, back at the bright water. 'Well,\nso you'll come to dinner, then? Shall we say half-past six. So good of\nyou!'\n\nHis voice, in uttering these conventional phrases, fell at once into\nthe false measure of society; and Herrick unconsciously followed the\nexample.\n\n'I am sure we shall be very glad,' he said. 'At half-past six? Thank you\nso very much.'\n\n     '\"For my voice has been tuned to the note of the gun\n\n     That startles the deep when the combat's begun,\"'\n\nquoted Attwater, with a smile, which instantly gave way to an air\nof funereal solemnity. 'I shall particularly expect Mr Whish,' he\ncontinued. 'Mr Whish, I trust you understand the invitation?'\n\n'I believe you, my boy!' replied the genial Huish.\n\n'That is right then; and quite understood, is it not?' said Attwater.\n'Mr Whish and Captain Brown at six-thirty without fault--and you, Hay,\nat four sharp.'\n\nAnd he called his boat.\n\nDuring all this talk, a load of thought or anxiety had weighed upon the\ncaptain. There was no part for which nature had so liberally endowed\nhim as that of the genial ship captain. But today he was silent and\nabstracted. Those who knew him could see that he hearkened close to\nevery syllable, and seemed to ponder and try it in balances. It\nwould have been hard to say what look there was, cold, attentive, and\nsinister, as of a man maturing plans, which still brooded over the\nunconscious guest; it was here, it was there, it was nowhere; it was now\nso little that Herrick chid himself for an idle fancy; and anon it was\nso gross and palpable that you could say every hair on the man's head\ntalked mischief.\n\nHe woke up now, as with a start. 'You were talking of a charter,' said\nhe.\n\n'Was I?' said Attwater. 'Well, let's talk of it no more at present.'\n\n'Your own schooner is overdue, I understand?' continued the captain.\n\n'You understand perfectly, Captain Brown,' said Attwater; 'thirty-three\ndays overdue at noon today.'\n\n'She comes and goes, eh? plies between here and...?' hinted the captain.\n\n'Exactly; every four months; three trips in the year,' said Attwater.\n\n'You go in her, ever?' asked Davis.\n\n'No, one stops here,' said Attwater, 'one has plenty to attend to.'\n\n'Stop here, do you?' cried Davis. 'Say, how long?'\n\n'How long, O Lord,' said Attwater with perfect, stern gravity. 'But it\ndoes not seem so,' he added, with a smile.\n\n'No, I dare say not,' said Davis. 'No, I suppose not. Not with all your\ngods about you, and in as snug a berth as this. For it is a pretty snug\nberth,' said he, with a sweeping look.\n\n'The spot, as you are good enough to indicate, is not entirely\nintolerable,' was the reply.\n\n'Shell, I suppose?' said Davis.\n\n'Yes, there was shell,' said Attwater.\n\n'This is a considerable big beast of a lagoon, sir,' said the captain.\n'Was there a--was the fishing--would you call the fishing anyways GOOD?'\n\n'I don't know that I would call it anyways anything,' said Attwater, 'if\nyou put it to me direct.'\n\n'There were pearls too?' said Davis.\n\n'Pearls, too,' said Attwater.\n\n'Well, I give out!' laughed Davis, and his laughter rang cracked like a\nfalse piece. 'If you're not going to tell, you're not going to tell, and\nthere's an end to it.'\n\n'There can be no reason why I should affect the least degree of secrecy\nabout my island,' returned Attwater; 'that came wholly to an end with\nyour arrival; and I am sure, at any rate, that gentlemen like you and Mr\nWhish, I should have always been charmed to make perfectly at home. The\npoint on which we are now differing--if you can call it a difference--is\none of times and seasons. I have some information which you think I\nmight impart, and I think not. Well, we'll see tonight! By-by, Whish!'\nHe stepped into his boat and shoved off. 'All understood, then?' said\nhe. 'The captain and Mr Whish at six-thirty, and you, Hay, at four\nprecise. You understand that, Hay? Mind, I take no denial. If you're not\nthere by the time named, there will be no banquet; no song, no supper,\nMr Whish!'\n\nWhite birds whisked in the air above, a shoal of parti-coloured fishes\nin the scarce denser medium below; between, like Mahomet's coffin, the\nboat drew away briskly on the surface, and its shadow followed it over\nthe glittering floor of the lagoon. Attwater looked steadily back\nover his shoulders as he sat; he did not once remove his eyes from the\nFarallone and the group on her quarter-deck beside the house, till\nhis boat ground upon the pier. Thence, with an agile pace, he hurried\nashore, and they saw his white clothes shining in the chequered dusk of\nthe grove until the house received him.\n\nThe captain, with a gesture and a speaking countenance, called the\nadventurers into the cabin.\n\n'Well,' he said to Herrick, when they were seated, 'there's one good job\nat least. He's taken to you in earnest.'\n\n'Why should that be a good job?' said Herrick.\n\n'Oh, you'll see how it pans out presently,' returned Davis. 'You go\nashore and stand in with him, that's all! You'll get lots of pointers;\nyou can find out what he has, and what the charter is, and who's the\nfourth man--for there's four of them, and we're only three.'\n\n'And suppose I do, what next?' cried Herrick. 'Answer me that!'\n\n'So I will, Robert Herrick,' said the captain. 'But first, let's see all\nclear. I guess you know,' he said with an imperious solemnity, 'I guess\nyou know the bottom is out of this Farallone speculation? I guess you\nknow it's RIGHT out? and if this old island hadn't been turned up right\nwhen it did, I guess you know where you and I and Huish would have\nbeen?'\n\n'Yes, I know that,' said Herrick. 'No matter who's to blame, I know it.\nAnd what next?'\n\n'No matter who's to blame, you know it, right enough,' said the captain,\n'and I'm obliged to you for the reminder. Now here's this Attwater: what\ndo you think of him?'\n\n'I do not know,' said Herrick. 'I am attracted and repelled. He was\ninsufferably rude to you.'\n\n'And you, Huish?' said the captain.\n\nHuish sat cleaning a favourite briar root; he scarce looked up from that\nengrossing task. 'Don't ast me what I think of him!' he said. 'There's a\nday comin', I pray Gawd, when I can tell it him myself.'\n\n'Huish means the same as what I do,' said Davis. 'When that man came\nstepping around, and saying \"Look here, I'm Attwater\"--and you knew it\nwas so, by God!--I sized him right straight up. Here's the real\narticle, I said, and I don't like it; here's the real, first-rate,\ncopper-bottomed aristocrat. 'AW' I DON'T KNOW YE, DO I? GOD DAMN YE, DID\nGOD MAKE YE?' No, that couldn't be nothing but genuine; a man got to be\nborn to that, and notice! smart as champagne and hard as nails; no kind\nof a fool; no, SIR! not a pound of him! Well, what's he here upon this\nbeastly island for? I said. HE'S not here collecting eggs. He's a palace\nat home, and powdered flunkies; and if he don't stay there, you bet he\nknows the reason why! Follow?'\n\n'O yes, I 'ear you,' said Huish.\n\n'He's been doing good business here, then,' continued the captain. 'For\nten years, he's been doing a great business. It's pearl and shell, of\ncourse; there couldn't be nothing else in such a place, and no doubt\nthe shell goes off regularly by this Trinity Hall, and the money for it\nstraight into the bank, so that's no use to us. But what else is there?\nIs there nothing else he would be likely to keep here? Is there nothing\nelse he would be bound to keep here? Yes, sir; the pearls! First,\nbecause they're too valuable to trust out of his hands. Second, because\npearls want a lot of handling and matching; and the man who sells his\npearls as they come in, one here, one there, instead of hanging back and\nholding up--well, that man's a fool, and it's not Attwater.'\n\n'Likely,' said Huish, 'that's w'at it is; not proved, but likely.'\n\n'It's proved,' said Davis bluntly.\n\n'Suppose it was?' said Herrick. 'Suppose that was all so, and he had\nthese pearls--a ten years' collection of them?--Suppose he had? There's\nmy question.'\n\nThe captain drummed with his thick hands on the board in front of him;\nhe looked steadily in Herrick's face, and Herrick as steadily looked\nupon the table and the pattering fingers; there was a gentle oscillation\nof the anchored ship, and a big patch of sunlight travelled to and fro\nbetween the one and the other.\n\n'Hear me!' Herrick burst out suddenly.\n\n'No, you better hear me first,' said Davis. 'Hear me and understand me.\nWE'VE got no use for that fellow, whatever you may have. He's your kind,\nhe's not ours; he's took to you, and he's wiped his boots on me and\nHuish. Save him if you can!'\n\n'Save him?' repeated Herrick.\n\n'Save him, if you're able!' reiterated Davis, with a blow of his\nclenched fist. 'Go ashore, and talk him smooth; and if you get him and\nhis pearls aboard, I'll spare him. If you don't, there's going to be a\nfuneral. Is that so, Huish? does that suit you?'\n\n'I ain't a forgiving man,' said Huish, 'but I'm not the sort to spoil\nbusiness neither. Bring the bloke on board and bring his pearls along\nwith him, and you can have it your own way; maroon him where you\nlike--I'm agreeable.'\n\n'Well, and if I can't?' cried Herrick, while the sweat streamed upon his\nface. 'You talk to me as if I was God Almighty, to do this and that! But\nif I can't?'\n\n'My son,' said the captain, 'you better do your level best, or you'll\nsee sights!'\n\n'O yes,' said Huish. 'O crikey, yes!' He looked across at Herrick with\na toothless smile that was shocking in its savagery; and his ear caught\napparently by the trivial expression he had used, broke into a piece of\nthe chorus of a comic song which he must have heard twenty years before\nin London: meaningless gibberish that, in that hour and place, seemed\nhateful as a blasphemy: 'Hikey, pikey, crikey, fikey, chillingawallaba\ndory.'\n\nThe captain suffered him to finish; his face was unchanged.\n\n'The way things are, there's many a man that wouldn't let you go\nashore,' he resumed. 'But I'm not that kind. I know you'd never go back\non me, Herrick! Or if you choose to--go, and do it, and be damned!' he\ncried, and rose abruptly from the table.\n\nHe walked out of the house; and as he reached the door, turned and\ncalled Huish, suddenly and violently, like the barking of a dog. Huish\nfollowed, and Herrick remained alone in the cabin.\n\n'Now, see here!' whispered Davis. 'I know that man. If you open your\nmouth to him again, you'll ruin all.'\n\n\n\nChapter 8. BETTER ACQUAINTANCE\n\nThe boat was gone again, and already half-way to the Farallone, before\nHerrick turned and went unwillingly up the pier. From the crown of\nthe beach, the figure-head confronted him with what seemed irony,\nher helmeted head tossed back, her formidable arm apparently hurling\nsomething, whether shell or missile, in the direction of the anchored\nschooner. She seemed a defiant deity from the island, coming forth to\nits threshold with a rush as of one about to fly, and perpetuated in\nthat dashing attitude. Herrick looked up at her, where she towered above\nhim head and shoulders, with singular feelings of curiosity and romance,\nand suffered his mind to travel to and fro in her life-history. So long\nshe had been the blind conductress of a ship among the waves; so long\nshe had stood here idle in the violent sun, that yet did not avail\nto blister her; and was even this the end of so many adventures? he\nwondered, or was more behind? And he could have found in his heart to\nregret that she was not a goddess, nor yet he a pagan, that he might\nhave bowed down before her in that hour of difficulty.\n\nWhen he now went forward, it was cool with the shadow of many well-grown\npalms; draughts of the dying breeze swung them together overhead; and on\nall sides, with a swiftness beyond dragon-flies or swallows, the spots\nof sunshine flitted, and hovered, and returned. Underfoot, the sand was\nfairly solid and quite level, and Herrick's steps fell there noiseless\nas in new-fallen snow. It bore the marks of having been once weeded like\na garden alley at home; but the pestilence had done its work, and the\nweeds were returning. The buildings of the settlement showed here and\nthere through the stems of the colonnade, fresh painted, trim and dandy,\nand all silent as the grave. Only, here and there in the crypt, there\nwas a rustle and scurry and some crowing of poultry; and from behind the\nhouse with the verandahs, he saw smoke arise and heard the crackling of\na fire.\n\nThe stone houses were nearest him upon his right. The first was locked;\nin the second, he could dimly perceive, through a window, a certain\naccumulation of pearl-shell piled in the far end; the third, which stood\ngaping open on the afternoon, seized on the mind of Herrick with its\nmultiplicity and disorder of romantic things. Therein were cables,\nwindlasses and blocks of every size and capacity; cabin windows and\nladders; rusty tanks, a companion hutch; a binnacle with its brass\nmountings and its compass idly pointing, in the confusion and dusk of\nthat shed, to a forgotten pole; ropes, anchors, harpoons, a blubber\ndipper of copper, green with years, a steering wheel, a tool chest with\nthe vessel's name upon the top, the Asia: a whole curiosity-shop of sea\ncurios, gross and solid, heavy to lift, ill to break, bound with brass\nand shod with iron. Two wrecks at the least must have contributed to\nthis random heap of lumber; and as Herrick looked upon it, it seemed to\nhim as if the two ships' companies were there on guard, and he heard\nthe tread of feet and whisperings, and saw with the tail of his eye the\ncommonplace ghosts of sailor men.\n\nThis was not merely the work of an aroused imagination, but had\nsomething sensible to go upon; sounds of a stealthy approach were no\ndoubt audible; and while he still stood staring at the lumber, the voice\nof his host sounded suddenly, and with even more than the customary\nsoftness of enunciation, from behind.\n\n'Junk,', it said, 'only old junk! And does Mr Hay find a parable?'\n\n'I find at least a strong impression,' replied Herrick, turning quickly,\nlest he might be able to catch, on the face of the speaker, some\ncommentary on the words.\n\nAttwater stood in the doorway, which he almost wholly filled; his hands\nstretched above his head and grasping the architrave. He smiled when\ntheir eyes Met, but the expression was inscrutable.\n\n'Yes, a powerful impression. You are like me; nothing so affecting as\nships!' said he. 'The ruins of an empire would leave me frigid, when a\nbit of an old rail that an old shellback leaned on in the middle watch,\nwould bring me up all standing. But come, let's see some more of the\nisland. It's all sand and coral and palm trees; but there's a kind of a\nquaintness in the place.'\n\n'I find it heavenly,' said Herrick, breathing deep, with head bared in\nthe shadow.\n\n'Ah, that's because you're new from sea,' said Attwater. 'I dare say,\ntoo, you can appreciate what one calls it. It's a lovely name. It has\na flavour, it has a colour, it has a ring and fall to it; it's like its\nauthor--it's half Christian! Remember your first view of the island, and\nhow it's only woods and water; and suppose you had asked somebody for\nthe name, and he had answered--nemorosa Zacynthos!'\n\n'Jam medio apparet fluctu!' exclaimed Herrick. 'Ye gods, yes, how good!'\n\n'If it gets upon the chart, the skippers will make nice work of it,'\nsaid Attwater. 'But here, come and see the diving-shed.'\n\nHe opened a door, and Herrick saw a large display of apparatus neatly\nordered: pumps and pipes, and the leaded boots, and the huge snouted\nhelmets shining in rows along the wall; ten complete outfits.\n\n'The whole eastern half of my lagoon is shallow, you must understand,'\nsaid Attwater; 'so we were able to get in the dress to great advantage.\nIt paid beyond belief, and was a queer sight when they were at it,\nand these marine monsters'--tapping the nearest of the helmets--'kept\nappearing and reappearing in the midst of the lagoon. Fond of parables?'\nhe asked abruptly.\n\n'O yes!' said Herrick.\n\n'Well, I saw these machines come up dripping and go down again, and come\nup dripping and go down again, and all the while the fellow inside as\ndry as toast!' said Attwater; 'and I thought we all wanted a dress to\ngo down into the world in, and come up scatheless. What do you think the\nname was?' he inquired.\n\n'Self-conceit,' said Herrick.\n\n'Ah, but I mean seriously!' said Attwater.\n\n'Call it self-respect, then!' corrected Herrick, with a laugh.\n\n'And why not Grace? Why not God's Grace, Hay?' asked Attwater. 'Why\nnot the grace of your Maker and Redeemer, He who died for you, He\nwho upholds you, He whom you daily crucify afresh? There is nothing\nhere,'--striking on his bosom--'nothing there'--smiting the wall--'and\nnothing there'--stamping--'nothing but God's Grace! We walk upon it, we\nbreathe it; we live and die by it; it makes the nails and axles of the\nuniverse; and a puppy in pyjamas prefers self-conceit!' The huge dark\nman stood over against Herrick by the line of the divers' helmets, and\nseemed to swell and glow; and the next moment the life had gone from\nhim. 'I beg your pardon,' said he; 'I see you don't believe in God?'\n\n'Not in your sense, I am afraid,' said Herrick.\n\n'I never argue with young atheists or habitual drunkards,' said Attwater\nflippantly. 'Let us go across the island to the outer beach.'\n\nIt was but a little way, the greatest width of that island scarce\nexceeding a furlong, and they walked gently. Herrick was like one in\na dream. He had come there with a mind divided; come prepared to study\nthat ambiguous and sneering mask, drag out the essential man from\nunderneath, and act accordingly; decision being till then postponed.\nIron cruelty, an iron insensibility to the suffering of others, the\nuncompromising pursuit of his own interests, cold culture, manners\nwithout humanity; these he had looked for, these he still thought he\nsaw. But to find the whole machine thus glow with the reverberation of\nreligious zeal, surprised him beyond words; and he laboured in vain, as\nhe walked, to piece together into any kind of whole his odds and ends\nof knowledge--to adjust again into any kind of focus with itself, his\npicture of the man beside him.\n\n'What brought you here to the South Seas?' he asked presently.\n\n'Many things,' said Attwater. 'Youth, curiosity, romance, the love of\nthe sea, and (it will surprise you to hear) an interest in missions.\nThat has a good deal declined, which will surprise you less. They go the\nwrong way to work; they are too parsonish, too much of the old wife, and\neven the old apple wife. CLOTHES, CLOTHES, are their idea; but clothes\nare not Christianity, any more than they are the sun in heaven, or could\ntake the place of it! They think a parsonage with roses, and church\nbells, and nice old women bobbing in the lanes, are part and parcel\nof religion. But religion is a savage thing, like the universe it\nilluminates; savage, cold, and bare, but infinitely strong.'\n\n'And you found this island by an accident?' said Herrick.\n\n'As you did!' said Attwater. 'And since then I have had a business, and\na colony, and a mission of my own. I was a man of the world before I was\na Christian; I'm a man of the world still, and I made my mission pay.\nNo good ever came of coddling. A man has to stand up in God's sight\nand work up to his weight avoirdupois; then I'll talk to him, but not\nbefore. I gave these beggars what they wanted: a judge in Israel, the\nbearer of the sword and scourge; I was making a new people here; and\nbehold, the angel of the Lord smote them and they were not!'\n\nWith the very uttering of the words, which were accompanied by a\ngesture, they came forth out of the porch of the palm wood by the margin\nof the sea and full in front of the sun which was near setting. Before\nthem the surf broke slowly. All around, with an air of imperfect wooden\nthings inspired with wicked activity, the crabs trundled and scuttled\ninto holes. On the right, whither Attwater pointed and abruptly turned,\nwas the cemetery of the island, a field of broken stones from the\nbigness of a child's hand to that of his head, diversified by many\nmounds of the same material, and walled by a rude rectangular enclosure.\nNothing grew there but a shrub or two with some white flowers; nothing\nbut the number of the mounds, and their disquieting shape, indicated the\npresence of the dead.\n\n  'The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep!'\n\nquoted Attwater as he entered by the open gateway into that unholy\nclose. 'Coral to coral, pebbles to pebbles,' he said, 'this has been the\nmain scene of my activity in the South Pacific. Some were good, and some\nbad, and the majority (of course and always) null. Here was a fellow,\nnow, that used to frisk like a dog; if you had called him he came like\nan arrow from a bow; if you had not, and he came unbidden, you should\nhave seen the deprecating eye and the little intricate dancing\nstep. Well, his trouble is over now, he has lain down with kings and\ncouncillors; the rest of his acts, are they not written in the book\nof the chronicles? That fellow was from Penrhyn; like all the Penrhyn\nislanders he was ill to manage; heady, jealous, violent: the man with\nthe nose! He lies here quiet enough. And so they all lie.\n\n \"And darkness was the burier of the dead!\"'\n\nHe stood, in the strong glow of the sunset, with bowed head; his voice\nsounded now sweet and now bitter with the varying sense.\n\n'You loved these people?' cried Herrick, strangely touched.\n\n'I?' said Attwater. 'Dear no! Don't think me a philanthropist. I dislike\nmen, and hate women. If I like the islands at all, it is because you see\nthem here plucked of their lendings, their dead birds and cocked hats,\ntheir petticoats and coloured hose. Here was one I liked though,' and he\nset his foot upon a mound. 'He was a fine savage fellow; he had a dark\nsoul; yes, I liked this one. I am fanciful,' he added, looking hard at\nHerrick, 'and I take fads. I like you.'\n\nHerrick turned swiftly and looked far away to where the clouds were\nbeginning to troop together and amass themselves round the obsequies of\nday. 'No one can like me,' he said.\n\n'You are wrong there,' said the other, 'as a man usually is about\nhimself. You are attractive, very attractive.'\n\n'It is not me,' said Herrick; 'no one can like me. If you knew how I\ndespised myself--and why!' His voice rang out in the quiet graveyard.\n\n'I knew that you despised yourself,' said Attwater. 'I saw the blood\ncome into your face today when you remembered Oxford. And I could have\nblushed for you myself, to see a man, a gentleman, with these two vulgar\nwolves.'\n\nHerrick faced him with a thrill. 'Wolves?' he repeated.\n\n'I said wolves and vulgar wolves,' said Attwater. 'Do you know that\ntoday, when I came on board, I trembled?'\n\n'You concealed it well,' stammered Herrick.\n\n'A habit of mine,' said Attwater. 'But I was afraid, for all that: I was\nafraid of the two wolves.' He raised his hand slowly. 'And now, Hay, you\npoor lost puppy, what do you do with the two wolves?'\n\n'What do I do? I don't do anything,' said Herrick. 'There is nothing\nwrong; all is above board; Captain Brown is a good soul; he is a... he\nis...' The phantom voice of Davis called in his ear: 'There's going to\nbe a funeral' and the sweat burst forth and streamed on his brow. 'He\nis a family man,' he resumed again, swallowing; 'he has children at\nhome--and a wife.'\n\n'And a very nice man?' said Attwater. 'And so is Mr Whish, no doubt?'\n\n'I won't go so far as that,' said Herrick. 'I do not like Huish. And\nyet... he has his merits too.'\n\n'And, in short, take them for all in all, as good a ship's company as\none would ask?' said Attwater.\n\n'O yes,' said Herrick, 'quite.'\n\n'So then we approach the other point of why you despise yourself?' said\nAttwater.\n\n'Do we not all despise ourselves?' cried Herrick. 'Do not you?'\n\n'Oh, I say I do. But do I?' said Attwater. 'One thing I know at least:\nI never gave a cry like yours. Hay! it came from a bad conscience! Ah,\nman, that poor diving dress of self-conceit is sadly tattered! Today,\nnow, while the sun sets, and here in this burying place of brown\ninnocents, fall on your knees and cast your sins and sorrows on the\nRedeemer. Hay--'\n\n'Not Hay!' interrupted the other, strangling. 'Don't call me that! I\nmean... For God's sake, can't you see I'm on the rack?'\n\n'I see it, I know it, I put and keep you there, my fingers are on the\nscrews!' said Attwater. 'Please God, I will bring a penitent this\nnight before His throne. Come, come to the mercy-seat! He waits to be\ngracious, man--waits to be gracious!'\n\nHe spread out his arms like a crucifix, his face shone with the\nbrightness of a seraph's; in his voice, as it rose to the last word, the\ntears seemed ready.\n\nHerrick made a vigorous call upon himself. 'Attwater,' he said, 'you\npush me beyond bearing. What am I to do? I do not believe. It is living\ntruth to you; to me, upon my conscience, only folk-lore. I do not\nbelieve there is any form of words under heaven by which I can lift the\nburthen from my shoulders. I must stagger on to the end with the pack of\nmy responsibility; I cannot shift it; do you suppose I would not, if I\nthought I could? I cannot--cannot--cannot--and let that suffice.'\n\nThe rapture was all gone from Artwater's countenance; the dark apostle\nhad disappeared; and in his place there stood an easy, sneering\ngentleman, who took off his hat and bowed. It was pertly done, and the\nblood burned in Herrick's face.\n\n'What do you mean by that?' he cried.\n\n'Well, shall we go back to the house?' said Attwater. 'Our guests will\nsoon be due.'\n\nHerrick stood his ground a moment with clenched fists and teeth; and as\nhe so stood, the fact of his errand there slowly swung clear in front of\nhim, like the moon out of clouds. He had come to lure that man on board;\nhe was failing, even if it could be said that he had tried; he was sure\nto fail now, and knew it, and knew it was better so. And what was to be\nnext?\n\nWith a groan he turned to follow his host, who was standing with polite\nsmile, and instantly and somewhat obsequiously led the way in the now\ndarkened colonnade of palms. There they went in silence, the earth\ngave up richly of her perfume, the air tasted warm and aromatic in the\nnostrils; and from a great way forward in the wood, the brightness of\nlights and fire marked out the house of Attwater.\n\nHerrick meanwhile resolved and resisted an immense temptation to go up,\nto touch him on the arm and breathe a word in his ear: 'Beware, they are\ngoing to murder you.' There would be one life saved; but what of the two\nothers? The three lives went up and down before him like buckets in a\nwell, or like the scales of balances. It had come to a choice, and one\nthat must be speedy. For certain invaluable minutes, the wheels of life\nran before him, and he could still divert them with a touch to the one\nside or the other, still choose who was to live and who was to die. He\nconsidered the men. Attwater intrigued, puzzled, dazzled, enchanted and\nrevolted him; alive, he seemed but a doubtful good; and the thought of\nhim lying dead was so unwelcome that it pursued him, like a vision, with\nevery circumstance of colour and sound. Incessantly, he had before him\nthe image of that great mass of man stricken down in varying attitudes\nand with varying wounds; fallen prone, fallen supine, fallen on his\nside; or clinging to a doorpost with the changing face and the relaxing\nfingers of the death-agony. He heard the click of the trigger, the thud\nof the ball, the cry of the victim; he saw the blood flow. And this\nbuilding up of circumstance was like a consecration of the man, till he\nseemed to walk in sacrificial fillets. Next he considered Davis, with\nhis thick-fingered, coarse-grained, oat-bread commonness of nature, his\nindomitable valour and mirth in the old days of their starvation, the\nendearing blend of his faults and virtues, the sudden shining forth of a\ntenderness that lay too deep for tears; his children, Adar and her bowel\ncomplaint, and Adar's doll. No, death could not be suffered to approach\nthat head even in fancy; with a general heat and a bracing of his\nmuscles, it was borne in on Herrick that Adar's father would find in him\na son to the death. And even Huish showed a little in that sacredness;\nby the tacit adoption of daily life they were become brothers; there was\nan implied bond of loyalty in their cohabitation of the ship and their\npassed miseries, to which Herrick must be a little true or wholly\ndishonoured. Horror of sudden death for horror of sudden death, there\nwas here no hesitation possible: it must be Attwater. And no sooner was\nthe thought formed (which was a sentence) than his whole mind of man ran\nin a panic to the other side: and when he looked within himself, he was\naware only of turbulence and inarticulate outcry.\n\nIn all this there was no thought of Robert Herrick. He had complied with\nthe ebb-tide in man's affairs, and the tide had carried him away; he\nheard already the roaring of the maelstrom that must hurry him under.\nAnd in his bedevilled and dishonoured soul there was no thought of self.\n\nFor how long he walked silent by his companion Herrick had no guess.\nThe clouds rolled suddenly away; the orgasm was over; he found himself\nplacid with the placidity of despair; there returned to him the power of\ncommonplace speech; and he heard with surprise his own voice say: 'What\na lovely evening!'\n\n'Is it not?' said Attwater. 'Yes, the evenings here would be very\npleasant if one had anything to do. By day, of course, one can shoot.'\n\n'You shoot?' asked Herrick.\n\n'Yes, I am what you would call a fine shot,' said Attwater. 'It is\nfaith; I believe my balls will go true; if I were to miss once, it would\nspoil me for nine months.'\n\n'You never miss, then?' said Herrick.\n\n'Not unless I mean to,' said Attwater. 'But to miss nicely is the art.\nThere was an old king one knew in the western islands, who used to empty\na Winchester all round a man, and stir his hair or nick a rag out of his\nclothes with every ball except the last; and that went plump between the\neyes. It was pretty practice.'\n\n'You could do that?' asked Herrick, with a sudden chill.\n\n'Oh, I can do anything,' returned the other. 'You do not understand:\nwhat must be, must.'\n\nThey were now come near to the back part of the house. One of the men\nwas engaged about the cooking fire, which burned with the clear, fierce,\nessential radiance of cocoanut shells. A fragrance of strange meats was\nin the air. All round in the verandahs lamps were lighted, so that\nthe place shone abroad in the dusk of the trees with many complicated\npatterns of shadow.\n\n'Come and wash your hands,' said Attwater, and led the way into a clean,\nmatted room with a cot bed, a safe, or shelf or two of books in a glazed\ncase, and an iron washing-stand. Presently he cried in the native, and\nthere appeared for a moment in the doorway a plump and pretty young\nwoman with a clean towel.\n\n'Hullo!' cried Herrick, who now saw for the first time the fourth\nsurvivor of the pestilence, and was startled by the recollection of the\ncaptain's orders.\n\n'Yes,' said Attwater, 'the whole colony lives about the house, what's\nleft of it. We are all afraid of devils, if you please! and Taniera and\nshe sleep in the front parlour, and the other boy on the verandah.'\n\n'She is pretty,' said Herrick.\n\n'Too pretty,' said Attwater. 'That was why I had her married. A man\nnever knows when he may be inclined to be a fool about women; so when we\nwere left alone, I had the pair of them to the chapel and performed the\nceremony. She made a lot of fuss. I do not take at all the romantic view\nof marriage,' he explained.\n\n'And that strikes you as a safeguard?' asked Herrick with amazement.\n\n'Certainly. I am a plain man and very literal. WHOM GOD HATH JOINED\nTOGETHER, are the words, I fancy. So one married them, and respects the\nmarriage,' said Attwater.\n\n'Ah!' said Herrick.\n\n'You see, I may look to make an excellent marriage when I go home,'\nbegan Attwater, confidentially. 'I am rich. This safe alone'--laying his\nhand upon it--'will be a moderate fortune, when I have the time to place\nthe pearls upon the market. Here are ten years' accumulation from a\nlagoon, where I have had as many as ten divers going all day long; and I\nwent further than people usually do in these waters, for I rotted a lot\nof shell, and did splendidly. Would you like to see them?'\n\nThis confirmation of the captain's guess hit Herrick hard, and he\ncontained himself with difficulty. 'No, thank you, I think not,' said\nhe. 'I do not care for pearls. I am very indifferent to all these...'\n\n'Gewgaws?' suggested Attwater. 'And yet I believe you ought to cast an\neye on my collection, which is really unique, and which--oh! it is the\ncase with all of us and everything about us!--hangs by a hair. Today\nit groweth up and flourisheth; tomorrow it is cut down and cast into the\noven. Today it is here and together in this safe; tomorrow--tonight!--it\nmay be scattered. Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of\nthee.'\n\n'I do not understand you,' said Herrick.\n\n'Not?' said Attwater.\n\n'You seem to speak in riddles,' said Herrick, unsteadily. 'I do not\nunderstand what manner of man you are, nor what you are driving at.'\n\nAttwater stood with his hands upon his hips, and his head bent forward.\n'I am a fatalist,' he replied, 'and just now (if you insist on it)\nan experimentalist. Talking of which, by the bye, who painted out the\nschooner's name?' he said, with mocking softness, 'because, do you know?\none thinks it should be done again. It can still be partly read; and\nwhatever is worth doing, is surely worth doing well. You think with\nme? That is so nice! Well, shall we step on the verandah? I have a dry\nsherry that I would like your opinion of.'\n\nHerrick followed him forth to where, under the light of the hanging\nlamps, the table shone with napery and crystal; followed him as the\ncriminal goes with the hangman, or the sheep with the butcher; took the\nsherry mechanically, drank it, and spoke mechanical words of praise. The\nobject of his terror had become suddenly inverted; till then he had seen\nAttwater trussed and gagged, a helpless victim, and had longed to run in\nand save him; he saw him now tower up mysterious and menacing, the angel\nof the Lord's wrath, armed with knowledge and threatening judgment. He\nset down his glass again, and was surprised to see it empty.\n\n'You go always armed?' he said, and the next moment could have plucked\nhis tongue out.\n\n'Always,' said Attwater. 'I have been through a mutiny here; that was\none of my incidents of missionary life.'\n\nAnd just then the sound of voices reached them, and looking forth from\nthe verandah they saw Huish and the captain drawing near.\n\n\n\nChapter 9. THE DINNER PARTY\n\nThey sat down to an island dinner, remarkable for its variety and\nexcellence; turtle soup and steak, fish, fowls, a sucking pig, a\ncocoanut salad, and sprouting cocoanut roasted for dessert. Not a tin\nhad been opened; and save for the oil and vinegar in the salad, and some\ngreen spears of onion which Attwater cultivated and plucked with his own\nhand, not even the condiments were European. Sherry, hock, and claret\nsucceeded each other, and the Farallone champagne brought up the rear\nwith the dessert.\n\nIt was plain that, like so many of the extremely religious in the\ndays before teetotalism, Attwater had a dash of the epicure. For such\ncharacters it is softening to eat well; doubly so to have designed and\nhad prepared an excellent meal for others; and the manners of their host\nwere agreeably mollified in consequence.\n\nA cat of huge growth sat on his shoulders purring, and occasionally,\nwith a deft paw, capturing a morsel in the air. To a cat he might be\nlikened himself, as he lolled at the head of his table, dealing\nout attentions and innuendoes, and using the velvet and the claw\nindifferently. And both Huish and the captain fell progressively under\nthe charm of his hospitable freedom.\n\nOver the third guest, the incidents of the dinner may be said to have\npassed for long unheeded. Herrick accepted all that was offered him, ate\nand drank without tasting, and heard without comprehension. His mind\nwas singly occupied in contemplating the horror of the circumstances in\nwhich he sat. What Attwater knew, what the captain designed, from which\nside treachery was to be first expected, these were the ground of his\nthoughts. There were times when he longed to throw down the table and\nflee into the night. And even that was debarred him; to do anything,\nto say anything, to move at all, were only to precipitate the barbarous\ntragedy; and he sat spellbound, eating with white lips. Two of his\ncompanions observed him narrowly, Attwater with raking, sidelong glances\nthat did not interrupt his talk, the captain with a heavy and anxious\nconsideration.\n\n'Well, I must say this sherry is a really prime article,' said Huish.\n''Ow much does it stand you in, if it's a fair question?'\n\n'A hundred and twelve shillings in London, and the freight to\nValparaiso, and on again,' said Attwater. 'It strikes one as really not\na bad fluid.'\n\n'A 'undred and twelve!' murmured the clerk, relishing the wine and the\nfigures in a common ecstasy: 'O my!'\n\n'So glad you like it,' said Attwater. 'Help yourself, Mr Whish, and keep\nthe bottle by you.'\n\n'My friend's name is Huish and not Whish, sit,' said the captain with a\nflush.\n\n'I beg your pardon, I am sure. Huish and not Whish, certainly,' said\nAttwater. 'I was about to say that I have still eight dozen,' he added,\nfixing the captain with his eye.\n\n'Eight dozen what?' said Davis.\n\n'Sherry,' was the reply. 'Eight dozen excellent sherry. Why, it seems\nalmost worth it in itself; to a man fond of wine.'\n\nThe ambiguous words struck home to guilty consciences, and Huish and the\ncaptain sat up in their places and regarded him with a scare.\n\n'Worth what?' said Davis.\n\n'A hundred and twelve shillings,' replied Attwater.\n\nThe captain breathed hard for a moment. He reached out far and wide to\nfind any coherency in these remarks; then, with a great effort, changed\nthe subject.\n\n'I allow we are about the first white men upon this island, sir,' said\nhe.\n\nAttwater followed him at once, and with entire gravity, to the new\nground. 'Myself and Dr Symonds excepted, I should say the only ones,' he\nreturned. 'And yet who can tell? In the course of the ages someone may\nhave lived here, and we sometimes think that someone must. The cocoa\npalms grow all round the island, which is scarce like nature's planting.\nWe found besides, when we landed, an unmistakable cairn upon the beach;\nuse unknown; but probably erected in the hope of gratifying some mumbo\njumbo whose very name is forgotten, by some thick-witted gentry whose\nvery bones are lost. Then the island (witness the Directory) has been\ntwice reported; and since my tenancy, we have had two wrecks, both\nderelict. The rest is conjecture.'\n\n'Dr Symonds is your partner, I guess?' said Davis.\n\n'A dear fellow, Symonds! How he would regret it, if he knew you had been\nhere!' said Attwater.\n\n''E's on the Trinity 'All, ain't he?' asked Huish.\n\n'And if you could tell me where the Trinity 'All was, you would confer a\nfavour, Mr Whish!' was the reply.\n\n'I suppose she has a native crew?' said Davis.\n\n'Since the secret has been kept ten years, one would suppose she had,'\nreplied Attwater.\n\n'Well, now, see 'ere!' said Huish. 'You have everything about you in\nno end style, and no mistake, but I tell you it wouldn't do for me. Too\nmuch of \"the old rustic bridge by the mill\"; too retired, by 'alf. Give\nme the sound of Bow Bells!'\n\n'You must not think it was always so,' replied Attwater, 'This was once\na busy shore, although now, hark! you can hear the solitude. I find it\nstimulating. And talking of the sound of bells, kindly follow a little\nexperiment of mine in silence.' There was a silver bell at his right\nhand to call the servants; he made them a sign to stand still, struck\nthe bell with force, and leaned eagerly forward. The note rose clear and\nstrong; it rang out clear and far into the night and over the deserted\nisland; it died into the distance until there only lingered in the\nporches of the ear a vibration that was sound no longer. 'Empty houses,\nempty sea, solitary beaches!' said Attwater. 'And yet God hears the\nbell! And yet we sit in this verandah on a lighted stage with all heaven\nfor spectators! And you call that solitude?'\n\nThere followed a bar of silence, during which the captain sat\nmesmerised.\n\nThen Attwater laughed softly. 'These are the diversions of a lonely,\nman,' he resumed, 'and possibly not in good taste. One tells oneself\nthese little fairy tales for company. If there SHOULD happen to be\nanything in folk-lore, Mr Hay? But here comes the claret. One does not\noffer you Lafitte, captain, because I believe it is all sold to the\nrailroad dining cars in your great country; but this Brine-Mouton is of\na good year, and Mr Whish will give me news of it.'\n\n'That's a queer idea of yours!' cried the captain, bursting with a sigh\nfrom the spell that had bound him. 'So you mean to tell me now, that\nyou sit here evenings and ring up... well, ring on the angels... by\nyourself?'\n\n'As a matter of historic fact, and since you put it directly, one does\nnot,' said Attwater. 'Why ring a bell, when there flows out from oneself\nand everything about one a far more momentous silence? the least beat of\nmy heart and the least thought in my mind echoing into eternity for ever\nand for ever and for ever.'\n\n'O look 'ere,' said Huish, 'turn down the lights at once, and the Band\nof 'Ope will oblige! This ain't a spiritual seance.'\n\n'No folk-lore about Mr Whish--I beg your pardon, captain: Huish not\nWhish, of course,' said Attwater.\n\nAs the boy was filling Huish's glass, the bottle escaped from his hand\nand was shattered, and the wine spilt on the verandah floor. Instant\ngrimness as of death appeared on the face of Attwater; he smote the\nbell imperiously, and the two brown natives fell into the attitude\nof attention and stood mute and trembling. There was just a moment of\nsilence and hard looks; then followed a few savage words in the native;\nand, upon a gesture of dismissal, the service proceeded as before.\n\nNone of the party had as yet observed upon the excellent bearing of the\ntwo men. They were dark, undersized, and well set up; stepped softly,\nwaited deftly, brought on the wines and dishes at a look, and their eyes\nattended studiously on their master.\n\n'Where do you get your labour from anyway?' asked Davis.\n\n'Ah, where not?' answered Attwater.\n\n'Not much of a soft job, I suppose?' said the captain.\n\n'If you will tell me where getting labour is!' said Attwater with a\nshrug. 'And of course, in our case, as we could name no destination,\nwe had to go far and wide and do the best we could. We have gone as far\nwest as the Kingsmills and as far south as Rapa-iti. Pity Symonds isn't\nhere! He is full of yarns. That was his part, to collect them. Then\nbegan mine, which was the educational.'\n\n'You mean to run them?' said Davis.\n\n'Ay! to run them,' said Attwater.\n\n'Wait a bit,' said Davis, 'I'm out of my depth. How was this? Do you\nmean to say you did it single-handed?'\n\n\n'One did it single-handed,' said Attwater, 'because there was nobody to\nhelp one.'\n\n'By God, but you must be a holy terror!' cried the captain, in a glow of\nadmiration.\n\n'One does one's best,' said Attwater.\n\n'Well, now!' said Davis, 'I have seen a lot of driving in my time and\nbeen counted a good driver myself; I fought my way, third mate, round\nthe Cape Horn with a push of packet rats that would have turned the\ndevil out of hell and shut the door on him; and I tell you, this racket\nof Mr Attwater's takes the cake. In a ship, why, there ain't nothing to\nit! You've got the law with you, that's what does it. But put me down on\nthis blame' beach alone, with nothing but a whip and a mouthful of bad\nwords, and ask me to... no, SIR! it's not good enough! I haven't got the\nsand for that!' cried Davis. 'It's the law behind,' he added; 'it's the\nlaw does it, every time!'\n\n'The beak ain't as black as he's sometimes pynted,' observed Huish,\nhumorously.\n\n'Well, one got the law after a fashion,' said Attwater. 'One had to be a\nnumber of things. It was sometimes rather a bore.'\n\n'I should smile!' said Davis. 'Rather lively, I should think!'\n\n'I dare say we mean the same thing,' said Attwater. 'However, one way\nor another, one got it knocked into their heads that they MUST work, and\nthey DID... until the Lord took them!'\n\n''Ope you made 'em jump,' said Huish.\n\n'When it was necessary, Mr Whish, I made them jump,' said Attwater.\n\n'You bet you did,' cried the captain. He was a good deal flushed, but\nnot so much with wine as admiration; and his eyes drank in the huge\nproportions of the other with delight. 'You bet you did, and you bet\nthat I can see you doing it! By God, you're a man, and you can say I\nsaid so.'\n\n'Too good of you, I'm sure,' said Attwater.\n\n'Did you--did you ever have crime here?' asked Herrick, breaking his\nsilence with a pungent voice.\n\n'Yes,' said Attwater, 'we did.'\n\n'And how did you handle that, sir?' cried the eager captain.\n\n'Well, you see, it was a queer case,' replied Attwater, 'it was a case\nthat would have puzzled Solomon. Shall I tell it you? yes?'\n\nThe captain rapturously accepted.\n\n'Well,' drawled Attwater, 'here is what it was. I dare say you know two\ntypes of natives, which may be called the obsequious and the sullen?\nWell, one had them, the types themselves, detected in the fact; and one\nhad them together. Obsequiousness ran out of the first like wine out\nof a bottle, sullenness congested in the second. Obsequiousness was all\nsmiles; he ran to catch your eye, he loved to gabble; and he had about\na dozen words of beach English, and an eighth-of-an-inch veneer of\nChristianity. Sullens was industrious; a big down-looking bee. When\nhe was spoken to, he answered with a black look and a shrug of one\nshoulder, but the thing would be done. I don't give him to you for a\nmodel of manners; there was nothing showy about Sullens; but he was\nstrong and steady, and ungraciously obedient. Now Sullens got into\ntrouble; no matter how; the regulations of the place were broken, and\nhe was punished accordingly--without effect. So, the next day, and the\nnext, and the day after, till I began to be weary of the business, and\nSullens (I am afraid) particularly so. There came a day when he was in\nfault again, for the--oh, perhaps the thirtieth time; and he rolled a\ndull eye upon me, with a spark in it, and appeared to speak. Now\nthe regulations of the place are formal upon one point: we allow no\nexplanations; none are received, none allowed to be offered. So one\nstopped him instantly; but made a note of the circumstance. The next\nday, he was gone from the settlement. There could be nothing more\nannoying; if the labour took to running away, the fishery was wrecked.\nThere are sixty miles of this island, you see, all in length like the\nQueen's Highway; the idea of pursuit in such a place was a piece of\nsingle-minded childishness, which one did not entertain. Two days later,\nI made a discovery; it came in upon me with a flash that Sullens had\nbeen unjustly punished from beginning to end, and the real culprit\nthroughout had been Obsequiousness. The native who talks, like the woman\nwho hesitates, is lost. You set him talking and lying; and he talks, and\nlies, and watches your face to see if he has pleased you; till at\nlast, out comes the truth! It came out of Obsequiousness in the regular\ncourse. I said nothing to him; I dismissed him; and late as it was, for\nit was already night, set off to look for Sullens. I had not far to go:\nabout two hundred yards up the island, the moon showed him to me. He was\nhanging in a cocoa palm--I'm not botanist enough to tell you how--but\nit's the way, in nine cases out of ten, these natives commit suicide.\nHis tongue was out, poor devil, and the birds had got at him; I spare\nyou details, he was an ugly sight! I gave the business six good hours of\nthinking in this verandah. My justice had been made a fool of; I don't\nsuppose that I was ever angrier. Next day, I had the conch sounded and\nall hands out before sunrise. One took one's gun, and led the way, with\nObsequiousness. He was very talkative; the beggar supposed that all was\nright now he had confessed; in the old schoolboy phrase, he was\nplainly 'sucking up' to me; full of protestations of goodwill and\ngood behaviour; to which one answered one really can't remember what.\nPresently the tree came in sight, and the hanged man. They all burst out\nlamenting for their comrade in the island way, and Obsequiousness was\nthe loudest of the mourners. He was quite genuine; a noxious creature,\nwithout any consciousness of guilt. Well, presently--to make a long\nstory short--one told him to go up the tree. He stared a bit, looked at\none with a trouble in his eye, and had rather a sickly smile; but went.\nHe was obedient to the last; he had all the pretty virtues, but the\ntruth was not in him. So soon as he was up, he looked down, and there\nwas the rifle covering him; and at that he gave a whimper like a dog.\nYou could bear a pin drop; no more keening now. There they all crouched\nupon the ground, with bulging eyes; there was he in the tree top, the\ncolour of the lead; and between was the dead man, dancing a bit in the\nair. He was obedient to the last, recited his crime, recommended his\nsoul to God. And then...'\n\nAttwater paused, and Herrick, who had been listening attentively, made a\nconvulsive movement which upset his glass.\n\n'And then?' said the breathless captain.\n\n'Shot,' said Attwater. 'They came to ground together.'\n\nHerrick sprang to his feet with a shriek and an insensate gesture.\n\n'It was a murder,' he screamed. 'A cold-hearted, bloody-minded\nmurder! You monstrous being! Murderer and hypocrite--murderer and\nhypocrite--murderer and hypocrite--' he repeated, and his tongue\nstumbled among the words.\n\nThe captain was by him in a moment. 'Herrick!' he cried, 'behave\nyourself! Here, don't be a blame' fool!'\n\nHerrick struggled in his embrace like a frantic child, and suddenly\nbowing his face in his hands, choked into a sob, the first of many,\nwhich now convulsed his body silently, and now jerked from him\nindescribable and meaningless sounds.\n\n'Your friend appears over-excited,' remarked Attwater, sitting unmoved\nbut all alert at table.\n\n'It must be the wine,' replied the captain. 'He ain't no drinking\nman, you see. I--I think I'll take him away. A walk'll sober him up, I\nguess.'\n\nHe led him without resistance out of the verandah and into the night, in\nwhich they soon melted; but still for some time, as they drew away,\nhis comfortable voice was to be heard soothing and remonstrating, and\nHerrick answering, at intervals, with the mechanical noises of hysteria.\n\n''E's like a bloomin' poultry yard!' observed Huish, helping himself to\nwine (of which he spilled a good deal) with gentlemanly ease. 'A man\nshould learn to beyave at table,' he added.\n\n'Rather bad form, is it not?' said Attwater. 'Well, well, we are left\ntete-a-tete. A glass of wine with you, Mr Whish!'\n\n\n\nChapter 10. THE OPEN DOOR\n\nThe captain and Herrick meanwhile turned their back upon the lights in\nAttwater's verandah, and took a direction towards the pier and the beach\nof the lagoon.\n\nThe isle, at this hour, with its smooth floor of sand, the pillared roof\noverhead, and the prevalent illumination of the lamps, wore an air of\nunreality like a deserted theatre or a public garden at midnight. A man\nlooked about him for the statues and tables. Not the least air of wind\nwas stirring among the palms, and the silence was emphasised by the\ncontinuous clamour of the surf from the seashore, as it might be of\ntraffic in the next street.\n\nStill talking, still soothing him, the captain hurried his patient on,\nbrought him at last to the lagoon-side, and leading him down the beach,\nlaved his head and face with the tepid water. The paroxysm gradually\nsubsided, the sobs became less convulsive and then ceased; by an odd but\nnot quite unnatural conjunction, the captain's soothing current of\ntalk died away at the same time and by proportional steps, and the\npair remained sunk in silence. The lagoon broke at their feet in petty\nwavelets, and with a sound as delicate as a whisper; stars of all\ndegrees looked down on their own images in that vast mirror; and the\nmore angry colour of the Farallone's riding lamp burned in the middle\ndistance. For long they continued to gaze on the scene before them, and\nhearken anxiously to the rustle and tinkle of that miniature surf, or\nthe more distant and loud reverberations from the outer coast. For long\nspeech was denied them; and when the words came at last, they came to\nboth simultaneously. 'Say, Herrick...'the captain was beginning.\n\nBut Herrick, turning swiftly towards his companion, bent him down with\nthe eager cry: 'Let's up anchor, captain, and to sea!'\n\n'Where to, my son?' said the captain. 'Up anchor's easy saying. But\nwhere to?'\n\n'To sea,' responded Herrick. 'The sea's big enough! To sea--away from\nthis dreadful island and that, oh! that sinister man!'\n\n'Oh, we'll see about that,' said Davis. 'You brace up, and we'll see\nabout that. You're all run down, that's what's wrong with you; you're\nall nerves, like Jemimar; you've got to brace up good and be yourself\nagain, and then we'll talk.'\n\n'To sea,' reiterated Herrick, 'to sea tonight--now--this moment!'\n\n'It can't be, my son,' replied the captain firmly. 'No ship of mine puts\nto sea without provisions, you can take that for settled.'\n\n'You don't seem to understand,' said Herrick. 'The whole thing is over,\nI tell you. There is nothing to do here, when he knows all. That man\nthere with the cat knows all; can't you take it in?'\n\n'All what?' asked the captain, visibly discomposed. 'Why, he received us\nlike a perfect gentleman and treated us real handsome, until you began\nwith your foolery--and I must say I seen men shot for less, and nobody\nsorry! What more do you expect anyway?'\n\nHerrick rocked to and fro upon the sand, shaking his head.\n\n'Guying us,' he said, 'he was guying us--only guying us; it's all we're\ngood for.'\n\n'There was one queer thing, to be sure,' admitted the captain, with a\nmisgiving of the voice; 'that about the sherry. Damned if I caught on to\nthat. Say, Herrick, you didn't give me away?'\n\n'Oh! give you away!' repeated Herrick with weary, querulous scorn. 'What\nwas there to give away? We're transparent; we've got rascal branded\non us: detected rascal--detected rascal! Why, before he came on board,\nthere was the name painted out, and he saw the whole thing. He made sure\nwe would kill him there and then, and stood guying you and Huish on the\nchance. He calls that being frightened! Next he had me ashore; a fine\ntime I had! THE TWO WOLVES, he calls you and Huish.--WHAT IS THE PUPPY\nDOING WITH THE TWO WOLVES? he asked. He showed me his pearls; he said\nthey might be dispersed before morning, and ALL HUNG BY A HAIr--and\nsmiled as he said it, such a smile! O, it's no use, I tell you! He knows\nall, he sees through all; we only make him laugh with our pretences--he\nlooks at us and laughs like God!'\n\nThere was a silence. Davis stood with contorted brows, gazing into the\nnight.\n\n'The pearls?' he said suddenly. 'He showed them to you? he has them?'\n\n'No, he didn't show them; I forgot: only the safe they were in,' said\nHerrick. 'But you'll never get them!'\n\n'I've two words to say to that,' said the captain.\n\n'Do you think he would have been so easy at table, unless he was\nprepared?' cried Herrick. 'The servants were both armed. He was armed\nhimself; he always is; he told me. You will never deceive his vigilance.\nDavis, I know it! It's all up; all up. There's nothing for it, there's\nnothing to be done: all gone: life, honour, love. Oh, my God, my God,\nwhy was I born?'\n\nAnother pause followed upon this outburst.\n\nThe captain put his hands to his brow.\n\n'Another thing!' he broke out. 'Why did he tell you all this? Seems like\nmadness to me!'\n\nHerrick shook his head with gloomy iteration. 'You wouldn't understand\nif I were to tell you,' said he.\n\n'I guess I can understand any blame' thing that you can tell me,' said\nthe captain.\n\n'Well, then, he's a fatalist,' said Herrick.\n\n'What's that, a fatalist?' said Davis.\n\n'Oh, it's a fellow that believes a lot of things,' said Herrick,\n'believes that his bullets go true; believes that all falls out as God\nchooses, do as you like to prevent it; and all that.'\n\n'Why, I guess I believe right so myself,' said Davis.\n\n'You do?' said Herrick.\n\n'You bet I do!' says Davis.\n\nHerrick shrugged his shoulders. 'Well, you must be a fool,' said he, and\nhe leaned his head upon his knees.\n\nThe captain stood biting his hands.\n\n'There's one thing sure,' he said at last. 'I must get Huish out of\nthat. HE'S not fit to hold his end up with a man like you describe.'\n\nAnd he turned to go away. The words had been quite simple; not so the\ntone; and the other was quick to catch it.\n\n'Davis!' he cried, 'no! Don't do it. Spare ME, and don't do it--spare\nyourself, and leave it alone--for God's sake, for your children's sake!'\n\nHis voice rose to a passionate shrillness; another moment, and he might\nbe overheard by their not distant victim. But Davis turned on him with a\nsavage oath and gesture; and the miserable young man rolled over on his\nface on the sand, and lay speechless and helpless.\n\nThe captain meanwhile set out rapidly for Attwater's house. As he went,\nhe considered with himself eagerly, his thoughts racing. The man had\nunderstood, he had mocked them from the beginning; he would teach him\nto make a mockery of John Davis! Herrick thought him a god; give him a\nsecond to aim in, and the god was overthrown. He chuckled as he felt the\nbutt of his revolver. It should be done now, as he went in. From behind?\nIt was difficult to get there. From across the table? No, the captain\npreferred to shoot standing, so as you could be sure to get your hand\nupon your gun. The best would be to summon Huish, and when Attwater\nstood up and turned--ah, then would be the moment. Wrapped in his ardent\nprefiguration of events, the captain posted towards the house with his\nhead down.\n\n'Hands up! Halt!' cried the voice of Attwater.\n\nAnd the captain, before he knew what he was doing, had obeyed. The\nsurprise was complete and irremediable. Coming on the top crest of his\nmurderous intentions, he had walked straight into an ambuscade, and now\nstood, with his hands impotently lifted, staring at the verandah.\n\nThe party was now broken up. Attwater leaned on a post, and kept Davis\ncovered with a Winchester. One of the servants was hard by with a\nsecond at the port arms, leaning a little forward, round-eyed with eager\nexpectancy. In the open space at the head of the stair, Huish was partly\nsupported by the other native; his face wreathed in meaningless smiles,\nhis mind seemingly sunk in the contemplation of an unlighted cigar.\n\n'Well,' said Attwater, 'you seem to me to be a very twopenny pirate!'\n\nThe captain uttered a sound in his throat for which we have no name;\nrage choked him.\n\n'I am going to give you Mr Whish--or the wine-sop that remains of him,'\ncontinued Attwater. 'He talks a great deal when he drinks, Captain\nDavis of the Sea Ranger. But I have quite done with him--and return the\narticle with thanks. Now,' he cried sharply. 'Another false movement\nlike that, and your family will have to deplore the loss of an\ninvaluable parent; keep strictly still, Davis.'\n\nAttwater said a word in the native, his eye still undeviatingly fixed on\nthe captain; and the servant thrust Huish smartly forward from the\nbrink of the stair. With an extraordinary simultaneous dispersion of\nhis members, that gentleman bounded forth into space, struck the earth,\nricocheted, and brought up with his arms about a palm. His mind was\nquite a stranger to these events; the expression of anguish that\ndeformed his countenance at the moment of the leap was probably\nmechanical; and he suffered these convulsions in silence; clung to the\ntree like an infant; and seemed, by his dips, to suppose himself engaged\nin the pastime of bobbing for apples. A more finely sympathetic mind or\na more observant eye might have remarked, a little in front of him on\nthe sand, and still quite beyond reach, the unlighted cigar.\n\n 'There is your Whitechapel carrion!' said Attwater. 'And now\nyou might very well ask me why I do not put a period to you at once, as\nyou deserve. I will tell you why, Davis. It is because I have nothing to\ndo with the Sea Ranger and the people you drowned, or the Farallone and\nthe champagne that you stole. That is your account with God, He keeps\nit, and He will settle it when the clock strikes. In my own case, I have\nnothing to go on but suspicion, and I do not kill on suspicion, not even\nvermin like you. But understand! if ever I see any of you again, it is\nanother matter, and you shall eat a bullet. And now take yourself off.\nMarch! and as you value what you call your life, keep your hands up as\nyou go!'\n\nThe captain remained as he was, his hands up, his mouth open: mesmerised\nwith fury.\n\n'March!' said Attwater. 'One--two--three!'\n\nAnd Davis turned and passed slowly away. But even as he went, he was\nmeditating a prompt, offensive return. In the twinkling of an eye,\nhe had leaped behind a tree; and was crouching there, pistol in hand,\npeering from either side of his place of ambush with bared teeth; a\nserpent already poised to strike. And already he was too late. Attwater\nand his servants had disappeared; and only the lamps shone on the\ndeserted table and the bright sand about the house, and threw into the\nnight in all directions the strong and tall shadows of the palms.\n\nDavis ground his teeth. Where were they gone, the cowards? to what hole\nhad they retreated beyond reach? It was in vain he should try anything,\nhe, single and with a second-hand revolver, against three persons,\narmed with Winchesters, and who did not show an ear out of any of the\napertures of that lighted and silent house? Some of them might have\nalready ducked below it from the rear, and be drawing a bead upon him at\nthat moment from the low-browed crypt, the receptacle of empty bottles\nand broken crockery. No, there was nothing to be done but to bring away\n(if it were still possible) his shattered and demoralised forces.\n\n'Huish,' he said, 'come along.'\n\n''S lose my ciga',' said Huish, reaching vaguely forward.\n\nThe captain let out a rasping oath. 'Come right along here,' said he.\n\n''S all righ'. Sleep here 'th Atty-Attwa. Go boar' t'morr',' replied the\nfestive one.\n\n'If you don't come, and come now, by the living God, I'll shoot you!'\ncried the captain.\n\nIt is not to be supposed that the sense of these words in any way\npenetrated to the mind of Hulsh; rather that, in a fresh attempt upon\nthe cigar, he overbalanced himself and came flying erratically forward:\na course which brought him within reach of Davis.\n\n'Now you walk straight,' said the captain, clutching him, 'or I'll know\nwhy not!'\n\n''S lose my ciga',' replied Huish.\n\nThe captain's contained fury blazed up for a moment. He twisted Huish\nround, grasped him by the neck of the coat, ran him in front of him to\nthe pier end, and flung him savagely forward on his face.\n\n'Look for your cigar then, you swine!' said he, and blew his boat call\ntill the pea in it ceased to rattle.\n\nAn immediate activity responded on board the Farallone; far away voices,\nand soon the sound of oars, floated along the surface of the lagoon; and\nat the same time, from nearer hand, Herrick aroused himself and strolled\nlanguidly up. He bent over the insignificant figure of Huish, where it\ngrovelled, apparently insensible, at the base of the figure-head.\n\n'Dead?' he asked.\n\n'No, he's not dead,' said Davis.\n\n'And Attwater?' asked Herrick.\n\n'Now you just shut your head!' replied Davis. 'You can do that, I fancy,\nand by God, I'll show you how! I'll stand no more of your drivel.'\n\nThey waited accordingly in silence till the boat bumped on the furthest\npiers; then raised Huish, head and heels, carried him down the gangway,\nand flung him summarily in the bottom. On the way out he was heard\nmurmuring of the loss of his cigar; and after he had been handed up the\nside like baggage, and cast down in the alleyway to slumber, his last\naudible expression was: 'Splen'l fl' Attwa'!' This the expert construed\ninto 'Splendid fellow, Attwater'; with so much innocence had this great\nspirit issued from the adventures of the evening.\n\nThe captain went and walked in the waist with brief, irate turns;\nHerrick leaned his arms on the taffrail; the crew had all turned in. The\nship had a gentle, cradling motion; at times a block piped like a bird.\nOn shore, through the colonnade of palm stems, Attwater's house was to\nbe seen shining steadily with many lamps. And there was nothing else\nvisible, whether in the heaven above or in the lagoon below, but the\nstars and their reflections. It might have been minutes or it might have\nbeen hours, that Herrick leaned there, looking in the glorified water\nand drinking peace. 'A bath of stars,' he was thinking; when a hand was\nlaid at last on his shoulder.\n\n'Herrick,' said the captain, 'I've been walking off my trouble.'\n\nA sharp jar passed through the young man, but he neither answered nor so\nmuch as turned his head.\n\n'I guess I spoke a little rough to you on shore,' pursued the captain;\n'the fact is, I was real mad; but now it's over, and you and me have to\nturn to and think.'\n\n'I will NOT think,' said Herrick.\n\n'Here, old man!' said Davis, kindly; 'this won't fight, you know! You've\ngot to brace up and help me get things straight. You're not going back\non a friend? That's not like you, Herrick!'\n\n'O yes, it is,' said Herrick.\n\n'Come, come!' said the captain, and paused as if quite at a loss. 'Look\nhere,' he cried, 'you have a glass of champagne. I won't touch it, so\nthat'll show you if I'm in earnest. But it's just the pick-me-up for\nyou; it'll put an edge on you at once.'\n\n'O, you leave me alone!' said Herrick, and turned away.\n\nThe captain caught him by the sleeve; and he shook him off and turned on\nhim, for the moment, like a demoniac.\n\n'Go to hell in your own way!' he cried.\n\nAnd he turned away again, this time unchecked, and stepped forward to\nwhere the boat rocked alongside and ground occasionally against the\nschooner. He looked about him. A corner of the house was interposed\nbetween the captain and himself; all was well; no eye must see him in\nthat last act. He slid silently into the boat; thence, silently, into\nthe starry water.\n\nInstinctively he swam a little; it would be time enough to stop by and\nby.\n\nThe shock of the immersion brightened his mind immediately. The events\nof the ignoble day passed before him in a frieze of pictures, and he\nthanked 'whatever Gods there be' for that open door of suicide. In such\na little while he would be done with it, the random business at an end,\nthe prodigal son come home. A very bright planet shone before him and\ndrew a trenchant wake along the water. He took that for his line and\nfollowed it. That was the last earthly thing that he should look upon;\nthat radiant speck, which he had soon magnified into a City of Laputa,\nalong whose terraces there walked men and women of awful and benignant\nfeatures, who viewed him with distant commiseration. These imaginary\nspectators consoled him; he told himself their talk, one to another; it\nwas of himself and his sad destiny.\n\nFrom such flights of fancy, he was aroused by the growing coldness of\nthe water. Why should he delay? Here, where he was now, let him drop the\ncurtain, let him seek the ineffable refuge, let him lie down with all\nraces and generations of men in the house of sleep. It was easy to say,\neasy to do. To stop swimming: there was no mystery in that, if he could\ndo it. Could he? And he could not. He knew it instantly. He was aware\ninstantly of an opposition in his members, unanimous and invincible,\nclinging to life with a single and fixed resolve, finger by finger,\nsinew by sinew; something that was at once he and not he--at once within\nand without him;--the shutting of some miniature valve in his brain,\nwhich a single manly thought should suffice to open--and the grasp of an\nexternal fate ineluctable as gravity. To any man there may come at times\na consciousness that there blows, through all the articulations of his\nbody, the wind of a spirit not wholly his; that his mind rebels; that\nanother girds him and carries him whither he would not. It came now\nto Herrick, with the authority of a revelation. There was no escape\npossible. The open door was closed in his recreant face. He must go back\ninto the world and amongst men without illusion. He must stagger on to\nthe end with the pack of his responsibility and his disgrace, until\na cold, a blow, a merciful chance ball, or the more merciful hangman,\nshould dismiss him from his infamy. There were men who could commit\nsuicide; there were men who could not; and he was one who could not.\n\nFor perhaps a minute, there raged in his mind the coil of this\ndiscovery; then cheerless certitude followed; and, with an incredible\nsimplicity of submission to ascertained fact, he turned round and\nstruck out for shore. There was a courage in this which he could not\nappreciate; the ignobility of his cowardice wholly occupying him. A\nstrong current set against him like a wind in his face; he contended\nwith it heavily, wearily, without enthusiasm, but with substantial\nadvantage; marking his progress the while, without pleasure, by the\noutline of the trees. Once he had a moment of hope. He heard to the\nsouthward of him, towards the centre of the lagoon, the wallowing of\nsome great fish, doubtless a shark, and paused for a little, treading\nwater. Might not this be the hangman? he thought. But the wallowing died\naway; mere silence succeeded; and Herrick pushed on again for the shore,\nraging as he went at his own nature. Ay, he would wait for the shark;\nbut if he had heard him coming!... His smile was tragic. He could have\nspat upon himself.\n\nAbout three in the morning, chance, and the set of the current, and the\nbias of his own right-handed body, so decided it between them that he\ncame to shore upon the beach in front of Attwater's. There he sat down,\nand looked forth into a world without any of the lights of hope. The\npoor diving dress of self-conceit was sadly tattered! With the fairy\ntale of suicide, of a refuge always open to him, he had hitherto\nbeguiled and supported himself in the trials of life; and behold!\nthat also was only a fairy tale, that also was folk-lore. With the\nconsequences of his acts he saw himself implacably confronted for the\nduration of life: stretched upon a cross, and nailed there with the iron\nbolts of his own cowardice. He had no tears; he told himself no stories.\nHis disgust with himself was so complete that even the process of\napologetic mythology had ceased. He was like a man cast down from a\npillar, and every bone broken. He lay there, and admitted the facts, and\ndid not attempt to rise.\n\nDawn began to break over the far side of the atoll, the sky brightened,\nthe clouds became dyed with gorgeous colours, the shadows of the night\nlifted. And, suddenly, Herrick was aware that the lagoon and the trees\nwore again their daylight livery; and he saw, on board the Farallone,\nDavis extinguishing the lantern, and smoke rising from the galley.\n\nDavis, without doubt, remarked and recognised the figure on the beach;\nor perhaps hesitated to recognise it; for after he had gazed a long\nwhile from under his hand, he went into the house and fetched a glass.\nIt was very powerful; Herrick had often used it. With an instinct of\nshame, he hid his face in his hands.\n\n'And what brings you here, Mr Herrick-Hay, or Mr Hay-Herrick?' asked\nthe voice of Attwater. 'Your back view from my present position is\nremarkably fine, and I would continue to present it. We can get on very\nnicely as we are, and if you were to turn round, do you know? I think it\nwould be awkward.'\n\nHerrick slowly rose to his feet; his heart throbbed hard, a hideous\nexcitement shook him, but he was master of himself. Slowly he turned,\nand faced Attwater and the muzzle of a pointed rifle. 'Why could I not\ndo that last night?' he thought.\n\n'Well, why don't you fire?' he said aloud, with a voice that trembled.\n\nAttwater slowly put his gun under his arm, then his hands in his\npockets.\n\n'What brings you here?' he repeated.\n\n'I don't know,' said Herrick; and then, with a cry: 'Can you do anything\nwith me?'\n\n'Are you armed?' said Attwater. 'I ask for the form's sake.'\n\n'Armed? No!' said Herrick. 'O yes, I am, too!' And he flung upon the\nbeach a dripping pistol.\n\n'You are wet,' said Attwater.\n\n'Yes, I am wet,' said Herrick. 'Can you do anything with me?'\n\nAttwater read his face attentively.\n\n'It would depend a good deal upon what you are,' said he.\n\n'What I am? A coward!' said Herrick.\n\n'There is very little to be done with that,' said Attwater. 'And yet the\ndescription hardly strikes one as exhaustive.'\n\n'Oh, what does it matter?' cried Herrick. 'Here I am. I am broken\ncrockery; I am a burst drum; the whole of my life is gone to water; I\nhave nothing left that I believe in, except my living horror of myself.\nWhy do I come to you? I don't know; you are cold, cruel, hateful; and\nI hate you, or I think I hate you. But you are an honest man, an honest\ngentleman. I put myself, helpless, in your hands. What must I do? If I\ncan't do anything, be merciful and put a bullet through me; it's only a\npuppy with a broken leg!'\n\n'If I were you, I would pick up that pistol, come up to the house, and\nput on some dry clothes,' said Attwater.\n\n'If you really mean it?' said Herrick. 'You know they--we--they. .. But\nyou know all.'\n\n'I know quite enough,' said Attwater. 'Come up to the house.'\n\nAnd the captain, from the deck of the Farallone, saw the two men pass\ntogether under the shadow of the grove.\n\n\n\nChapter 11. DAVID AND GOLIATH\n\nHuish had bundled himself up from the glare of the day--his face to the\nhouse, his knees retracted. The frail bones in the thin tropical raiment\nseemed scarce more considerable than a fowl's; and Davis, sitting on the\nrail with his arm about a stay, contemplated him with gloom, wondering\nwhat manner of counsel that insignificant figure should contain. For\nsince Herrick had thrown him off and deserted to the enemy, Huish, alone\nof mankind, remained to him to be a helper and oracle.\n\nHe considered their position with a sinking heart. The ship was a stolen\nship; the stores, either from initial carelessness or ill administration\nduring the voyage, were insufficient to carry them to any port except\nback to Papeete; and there retribution waited in the shape of a\ngendarme, a judge with a queer-shaped hat, and the horror of distant\nNoumea. Upon that side, there was no glimmer of hope. Here, at the\nisland, the dragon was roused; Attwater with his men and his Winchesters\nwatched and patrolled the house; let him who dare approach it. What else\nwas then left but to sit there, inactive, pacing the decks--until the\nTrinity Hall arrived and they were cast into irons, or until the food\ncame to an end, and the pangs of famine succeeded? For the Trinity\nHall Davis was prepared; he would barricade the house, and die there\ndefending it, like a rat in a crevice. But for the other? The cruise of\nthe Farallone, into which he had plunged only a fortnight before, with\nsuch golden expectations, could this be the nightmare end of it? The\nship rotting at anchor, the crew stumbling and dying in the scuppers? It\nseemed as if any extreme of hazard were to be preferred to so grisly a\ncertainty; as if it would be better to up-anchor after all, put to sea\nat a venture, and, perhaps, perish at the hands of cannibals on one of\nthe more obscure Paumotus. His eye roved swiftly over sea and sky in\nquest of any promise of wind, but the fountains of the Trade were empty.\nWhere it had run yesterday and for weeks before, a roaring blue river\ncharioting clouds, silence now reigned; and the whole height of\nthe atmosphere stood balanced. On the endless ribbon of island that\nstretched out to either hand of him its array of golden and green and\nsilvery palms, not the most volatile frond was to be seen stirring;\nthey drooped to their stable images in the lagoon like things carved of\nmetal, and already their long line began to reverberate heat. There was\nno escape possible that day, none probable on the morrow. And still the\nstores were running out!\n\nThen came over Davis, from deep down in the roots of his being, or at\nleast from far back among his memories of childhood and innocence, a\nwave of superstition. This run of ill luck was something beyond natural;\nthe chances of the game were in themselves more various; it seemed as\nif the devil must serve the pieces. The devil? He heard again the clear\nnote of Attwater's bell ringing abroad into the night, and dying away.\nHow if God...?\n\nBriskly, he averted his mind. Attwater: that was the point. Attwater\nhad food and a treasure of pearls; escape made possible in the present,\nriches in the future. They must come to grips, with Attwater; the man\nmust die. A smoky heat went over his face, as he recalled the impotent\nfigure he had made last night and the contemptuous speeches he must bear\nin silence. Rage, shame, and the love of life, all pointed the one way;\nand only invention halted: how to reach him? had he strength enough? was\nthere any help in that misbegotten packet of bones against the house?\n\nHis eyes dwelled upon him with a strange avidity, as though he would\nread into his soul; and presently the sleeper moved, stirred uneasily,\nturned suddenly round, and threw him a blinking look. Davis maintained\nthe same dark stare, and Huish looked away again and sat up.\n\n'Lord, I've an 'eadache on me!' said he. 'I believe I was a bit swipey\nlast night. W'ere's that cry-byby 'Errick?'\n\n'Gone,' said the captain.\n\n'Ashore?' cried Huish. 'Oh, I say! I'd 'a gone too.'\n\n'Would you?' said the captain.\n\n'Yes, I would,' replied Huish. 'I like Attwater. 'E's all right; we\ngot on like one o'clock when you were gone. And ain't his sherry in it,\nrather? It's like Spiers and Ponds' Amontillado! I wish I 'ad a drain of\nit now.' He sighed.\n\n'Well, you'll never get no more of it--that's one thing,' said Davis,\ngravely.\n\n''Ere! wot's wrong with you, Dyvis? Coppers 'ot? Well, look at me! I\nain't grumpy,' said Huish; 'I'm as plyful as a canary-bird, I am.'\n\n'Yes,' said Davis, 'you're playful; I own that; and you were playful\nlast night, I believe, and a damned fine performance you made of it.'\n\n''Allo!' said Huish. ''Ow's this? Wot performance?'\n\n'Well, I'll tell you,' said the captain, getting slowly off the rail.\n\nAnd he did: at full length, with every wounding epithet and absurd\ndetail repeated and emphasised; he had his own vanity and Huish's upon\nthe grill, and roasted them; and as he spoke, he inflicted and endured\nagonies of humiliation. It was a plain man's masterpiece of the\nsardonic.\n\n'What do you think of it?' said he, when he had done, and looked down at\nHuish, flushed and serious, and yet jeering.\n\n'I'll tell you wot it is,' was the reply, 'you and me cut a pretty dicky\nfigure.'\n\n'That's so,' said Davis, 'a pretty measly figure, by God! And, by God, I\nwant to see that man at my knees.'\n\n'Ah!' said Huish. ''Ow to get him there?'\n\n'That's it!' cried Davis. 'How to get hold of him! They're four to two;\nthough there's only one man among them to count, and that's Attwater.\nGet a bead on Attwater, and the others would cut and run and sing out\nlike frightened poultry--and old man Herrick would come round with\nhis hat for a share of the pearls. No, SIR! it's how to get hold of\nAttwater! And we daren't even go ashore; he would shoot us in the boat\nlike dogs.'\n\n'Are you particular about having him dead or alive?' asked Huish.\n\n'I want to see him dead,' said the captain.\n\n'Ah, well!' said Huish, 'then I believe I'll do a bit of breakfast.'\n\nAnd he turned into the house.\n\nThe captain doggedly followed him.\n\n'What's this?' he asked. 'What's your idea, anyway?'\n\n'Oh, you let me alone, will you?' said Huish, opening a bottle of\nchampagne. 'You'll 'ear my idea soon enough. Wyte till I pour some\nchain on my 'ot coppers.' He drank a glass off, and affected to listen.\n''Ark!' said he, ''ear it fizz. Like 'am fryin', I declyre. 'Ave a\nglass, do, and look sociable.'\n\n'No!' said the captain, with emphasis; 'no, I will not! there's\nbusiness.'\n\n'You p'ys your money and you tykes your choice, my little man,' returned\nHuish. 'Seems rather a shyme to me to spoil your breakfast for wot's\nreally ancient 'istory.'\n\nHe finished three parts of a bottle of champagne, and nibbled a corner\nof biscuit, with extreme deliberation; the captain sitting opposite and\nchamping the bit like an impatient horse. Then Huish leaned his arms on\nthe table and looked Davis in the face.\n\n'W'en you're ready!' said he.\n\n'Well, now, what's your idea?' said Davis, with a sigh.\n\n'Fair play!' said Huish. 'What's yours?'\n\n'The trouble is that I've got none,' replied Davis; and wandered for\nsome time in aimless discussion of the difficulties in their path, and\nuseless explanations of his own fiasco.\n\n'About done?' said Huish.\n\n'I'll dry up right here,' replied Davis.\n\n'Well, then,' said Huish, 'you give me your 'and across the table, and\nsay, \"Gawd strike me dead if I don't back you up.\"'\n\nHis voice was hardly raised, yet it thrilled the hearer. His face seemed\nthe epitome of cunning, and the captain recoiled from it as from a blow.\n\n'What for?' said he.\n\n'Luck,' said Huish. 'Substantial guarantee demanded.'\n\nAnd he continued to hold out his hand.\n\n'I don't see the good of any such tomfoolery,' said the other.\n\n'I do, though,' returned Huish. 'Gimme your 'and and say the words; then\nyou'll 'ear my view of it. Don't, and you won't.'\n\nThe captain went through the required form, breathing short, and gazing\non the clerk with anguish. What to fear, he knew not; yet he feared\nslavishly what was to fall from the pale lips.\n\n'Now, if you'll excuse me 'alf a second,' said Huish, 'I'll go and fetch\nthe byby.'\n\n'The baby?' said Davis. 'What's that?'\n\n'Fragile. With care. This side up,' replied the clerk with a wink, as he\ndisappeared.\n\nHe returned, smiling to himself, and carrying in his hand a silk\nhandkerchief. The long stupid wrinkles ran up Davis's brow, as he saw\nit. What should it contain? He could think of nothing more recondite\nthan a revolver.\n\nHuish resumed his seat.\n\n'Now,' said he, 'are you man enough to take charge of 'Errick and the\nniggers? Because I'll take care of Hattwater.'\n\n'How?' cried Davis. 'You can't!'\n\n'Tut, tut!' said the clerk. 'You gimme time. Wot's the first point? The\nfirst point is that we can't get ashore, and I'll make you a present of\nthat for a 'ard one. But 'ow about a flag of truce? Would that do the\ntrick, d'ye think? or would Attwater simply blyze aw'y at us in the\nbloomin' boat like dawgs?'\n\n'No,' said Davis, 'I don't believe he would.'\n\n'No more do I,' said Huish; 'I don't believe he would either; and I'm\nsure I 'ope he won't! So then you can call us ashore. Next point is\nto get near the managin' direction. And for that I'm going to 'ave you\nwrite a letter, in w'ich you s'y you're ashamed to meet his eye, and\nthat the bearer, Mr J. L. 'Uish, is empowered to represent you. Armed\nwith w'ich seemin'ly simple expedient, Mr J. L. 'Uish will proceed to\nbusiness.'\n\nHe paused, like one who had finished, but still held Davis with his eye.\n\n'How?' said Davis. 'Why?'\n\n'Well, you see, you're big,' returned Huish; ''e knows you 'ave a gun in\nyour pocket, and anybody can see with 'alf an eye that you ain't the\nman to 'esitate about usin' it. So it's no go with you, and never was;\nyou're out of the runnin', Dyvis. But he won't be afryde of me, I'm such\na little un! I'm unarmed--no kid about that--and I'll hold my 'ands up\nright enough.' He paused. 'If I can manage to sneak up nearer to him as\nwe talk,' he resumed, 'you look out and back me up smart. If I don't, we\ngo aw'y again, and nothink to 'urt. See?'\n\nThe captain's face was contorted by the frenzied effort to comprehend.\n\n'No, I don't see,' he cried, 'I can't see. What do you mean?'\n\n'I mean to do for the Beast!' cried Huish, in a burst of venomous\ntriumph. 'I'll bring the 'ulkin' bully to grass. He's 'ad his larks out\nof me; I'm goin' to 'ave my lark out of 'im, and a good lark too!'\n\n'What is it?' said the captain, almost in a whisper.\n\n'Sure you want to know?' asked Huish.\n\nDavis rose and took a turn in the house.\n\n'Yes, I want to know,' he said at last with an effort.\n\n'We'n you're back's at the wall, you do the best you can, don't you?'\nbegan the clerk. 'I s'y that, because I 'appen to know there's a\nprejudice against it; it's considered vulgar, awf'ly vulgar.' He\nunrolled the handkerchief and showed a four-ounce jar. 'This 'ere's\nvitriol, this is,' said he.\n\nThe captain stared upon him with a whitening face.\n\n'This is the stuff!' he pursued, holding it up. 'This'll burn to the\nbone; you'll see it smoke upon 'im like 'ell fire! One drop upon 'is\nbloomin' heyesight, and I'll trouble you for Attwater!'\n\n'No, no, by God!' exclaimed the captain.\n\n'Now, see 'ere, ducky,' said Huish, 'this is my bean feast, I believe?\nI'm goin' up to that man single-'anded, I am. 'E's about seven foot\nhigh, and I'm five foot one. 'E's a rifle in his 'and, 'e's on the\nlook-out, 'e wasn't born yesterday. This is Dyvid and Goliar, I tell\nyou! If I'd ast you to walk up and face the music I could understand.\nBut I don't. I on'y ast you to stand by and spifflicate the niggers.\nIt'll all come in quite natural; you'll see, else! Fust thing, you know,\nyou'll see him running round and owling like a good un...'\n\n'Don't!' said Davis. 'Don't talk of it!'\n\n'Well, you ARE a juggins!' exclaimed Huish. 'What did you want? You\nwanted to kill him, and tried to last night. You wanted to kill the 'ole\nlot of them and tried to, and 'ere I show you 'ow; and because there's\nsome medicine in a bottle you kick up this fuss!'\n\n'I suppose that's so,' said Davis. 'It don't seem someways reasonable,\nonly there it is.'\n\n'It's the happlication of science, I suppose?' sneered Huish.\n\n'I don't know what it is,' cried Davis, pacing the floor; 'it's there!\nI draw the line at it. I can't put a finger to no such piggishness. It's\ntoo damned hateful!'\n\n'And I suppose it's all your fancy pynted it,' said Huish, 'w'en you\ntake a pistol and a bit o' lead, and copse a man's brains all over him?\nNo accountin' for tystes.'\n\n'I'm not denying it,' said Davis, 'It's something here, inside of me.\nIt's foolishness; I dare say it's dam foolishness. I don't argue, I just\ndraw the line. Isn't there no other way?'\n\n'Look for yourself,' said Huish. 'I ain't wedded to this, if you think I\nam; I ain't ambitious; I don't make a point of playin' the lead; I offer\nto, that's all, and if you can't show me better, by Gawd, I'm goin' to!'\n\n'Then the risk!' cried Davis.\n\n'If you ast me straight, I should say it was a case of seven to one and\nno takers,' said Huish. 'But that's my look-out, ducky, and I'm gyme,\nthat's wot I am: gyme all through.'\n\nThe captain looked at him. Huish sat there, preening his sinister\nvanity, glorying in his precedency in evil; and the villainous courage\nand readiness of the creature shone out of him like a candle from a\nlantern. Dismay and a kind of respect seized hold on Davis in his own\ndespite. Until that moment, he had seen the clerk always hanging\nback, always listless, uninterested, and openly grumbling at a word of\nanything to do; and now, by the touch of an enchanter's wand, he beheld\nhim sitting girt and resolved, and his face radiant. He had raised the\ndevil, he thought; and asked who was to control him? and his spirits\nquailed.\n\n'Look as long as you like,' Huish was going on. 'You don't see any green\nin my eye! I ain't afryde of Attwater, I ain't afryde of you, and I\nain't afryde of words. You want to kill people, that's wot YOU want; but\nyou want to do it in kid gloves, and it can't be done that w'y. Murder\nain't genteel, it ain't easy, it ain't safe, and it tykes a man to do\nit. 'Ere's the man.'\n\n'Huish!' began the captain with energy; and then stopped, and remained\nstaring at him with corrugated brows.\n\n'Well, hout with it!' said Huish. ''Ave you anythink else to put up? Is\nthere any other chanst to try?'\n\nThe captain held his peace.\n\n'There you are then!' said Huish with a shrug.\n\nDavis fell again to his pacing.\n\n'Oh, you may do sentry-go till you're blue in the mug, you won't find\nanythink else,' said Huish.\n\nThere was a little silence; the captain, like a man launched on a swing,\nflying dizzily among extremes of conjecture and refusal.\n\n'But see,' he said, suddenly pausing. 'Can you? Can the thing be done?\nIt--it can't be easy.'\n\n'If I get within twenty foot of 'im it'll be done; so you look out,'\nsaid Huish, and his tone of certainty was absolute.\n\n'How can you know that?' broke from the captain in a choked cry. 'You\nbeast, I believe you've done it before!'\n\n'Oh, that's private affyres,' returned Huish, 'I ain't a talking man.'\n\nA shock of repulsion struck and shook the captain; a scream rose almost\nto his lips; had he uttered it, he might have cast himself at the same\nmoment on the body of Huish, might have picked him up, and flung him\ndown, and wiped the cabin with him, in a frenzy of cruelty that seemed\nhalf moral. But the moment passed; and the abortive crisis left the man\nweaker. The stakes were so high--the pearls on the one hand--starvation\nand shame on the other. Ten years of pearls! The imagination of Davis\ntranslated them into a new, glorified existence for himself and his\nfamily. The seat of this new life must be in London; there were deadly\nreasons against Portland, Maine; and the pictures that came to him were\nof English manners. He saw his boys marching in the procession of a\nschool, with gowns on, an usher marshalling them and reading as he\nwalked in a great book. He was installed in a villa, semi-detached;\nthe name, Rosemore, on the gateposts. In a chair on the gravel walk, he\nseemed to sit smoking a cigar, a blue ribbon in his buttonhole, victor\nover himself and circumstances, and the malignity of bankers. He saw the\nparlour with red curtains and shells on the mantelpiece--and with the\nfine inconsistency of visions, mixed a grog at the mahogany table ere he\nturned in. With that the Farallone gave one of the aimless and nameless\nmovements which (even in an anchored ship and even in the most profound\ncalm) remind one of the mobility of fluids; and he was back again under\nthe cover of the house, the fierce daylight besieging it all round and\nglaring in the chinks, and the clerk in a rather airy attitude, awaiting\nhis decision.\n\nHe began to walk again. He aspired after the realisation of these\ndreams, like a horse nickering for water; the lust of them burned in his\ninside. And the only obstacle was Attwater, who had insulted him from\nthe first. He gave Herrick a full share of the pearls, he insisted on\nit; Huish opposed him, and he trod the opposition down; and praised\nhimself exceedingly. He was not going to use vitriol himself; was he\nHuish's keeper? It was a pity he had asked, but after all!... he saw the\nboys again in the school procession, with the gowns he had thought to be\nso 'tony' long since... And at the same time the incomparable shame of\nthe last evening blazed up in his mind.\n\n'Have it your own way!' he said hoarsely.\n\n'Oh, I knew you would walk up,' said Huish. 'Now for the letter. There's\npaper, pens and ink. Sit down and I'll dictyte.'\n\nThe captain took a seat and the pen, looked a while helplessly at the\npaper, then at Huish. The swing had gone the other way; there was a blur\nupon his eyes. 'It's a dreadful business,' he said, with a strong twitch\nof his shoulders.\n\n'It's rather a start, no doubt,' said Huish. 'Tyke a dip of ink. That's\nit. William John Hattwater, Esq., Sir': he dictated.\n\n'How do you know his name is William John?' asked Davis.\n\n'Saw it on a packing case,' said Huish. 'Got that?'\n\n'No,' said Davis. 'But there's another thing. What are we to write?'\n\n'O my golly!' cried the exasperated Huish. 'Wot kind of man do YOU call\nyourself? I'M goin' to tell you wot to write; that's my pitch; if you'll\njust be so bloomin' condescendin' as to write it down! WILLIAM JOHN\nATTWATER, ESQ., SIR': he reiterated. And the captain at last beginning\nhalf mechanically to move his pen, the dictation proceeded:\n\nIt is with feelings of shyme and 'artfelt contrition that I approach you\nafter the yumiliatin' events of last night. Our Mr 'Errick has left\nthe ship, and will have doubtless communicated to you the nature of our\n'opes. Needless to s'y, these are no longer possible: Fate 'as declyred\nagainst us, and we bow the 'ead. Well awyre as I am of the just\nsuspicions with w'ich I am regarded, I do not venture to solicit the\nfyvour of an interview for myself, but in order to put an end to a\nsituytion w'ich must be equally pyneful to all, I 'ave deputed my friend\nand partner, Mr J. L. Huish, to l'y before you my proposals, and w'ich\nby their moderytion, Will, I trust, be found to merit your attention.\nMr J. L. Huish is entirely unarmed, I swear to Gawd! and will 'old 'is\n'ands over 'is 'ead from the moment he begins to approach you. I am your\nfytheful servant, John Davis.\n\n\nHuish read the letter with the innocent joy of amateurs, chuckled\ngustfully to himself, and reopened it more than once after it was\nfolded, to repeat the pleasure; Davis meanwhile sitting inert and\nheavily frowning.\n\nOf a sudden he rose; he seemed all abroad. 'No!' he cried. 'No! it can't\nbe! It's too much; it's damnation. God would never forgive it.'\n\n'Well, and 'oo wants Him to?' returned Huish, shrill with fury. 'You\nwere damned years ago for the Sea Rynger, and said so yourself. Well\nthen, be damned for something else, and 'old your tongue.'\n\nThe captain looked at him mistily. 'No,' he pleaded, 'no, old man! don't\ndo it.'\n\n''Ere now,' said Huish, 'I'll give you my ultimytum. Go or st'y w'ere you\nare; I don't mind; I'm goin' to see that man and chuck this vitriol in\nhis eyes. If you st'y I'll go alone; the niggers will likely knock me\non the 'ead, and a fat lot you'll be the better! But there's one thing\nsure: I'll 'ear no more of your moonin', mullygrubbin' rot, and tyke it\nstryte.'\n\nThe captain took it with a blink and a gulp. Memory, with phantom\nvoices, repeated in his cars something similar, something he had once\nsaid to Herrick--years ago it seemed.\n\n'Now, gimme over your pistol,' said Huish. 'I 'ave to see all clear. Six\nshots, and mind you don't wyste them.'\n\nThe captain, like a man in a nightmare, laid down his revolver on the\ntable, and Huish wiped the cartridges and oiled the works.\n\nIt was close on noon, there was no breath of wind, and the heat was\nscarce bearable, when the two men came on deck, had the boat manned, and\npassed down, one after another, into the stern-sheets. A white shirt at\nthe end of an oar served as a flag of truce; and the men, by direction,\nand to give it the better chance to be observed, pulled with extreme\nslowness. The isle shook before them like a place incandescent; on\nthe face of the lagoon blinding copper suns, no bigger than sixpences,\ndanced and stabbed them in the eyeballs; there went up from sand and\nsea, and even from the boat, a glare of scathing brightness; and as they\ncould only peer abroad from between closed lashes, the excess of light\nseemed to be changed into a sinister darkness, comparable to that of a\nthundercloud before it bursts.\n\nThe captain had come upon this errand for any one of a dozen reasons,\nthe last of which was desire for its success. Superstition rules all\nmen; semi-ignorant and gross natures, like that of Davis, it rules\nutterly. For murder he had been prepared; but this horror of the\nmedicine in the bottle went beyond him, and he seemed to himself to be\nparting the last strands that united him to God. The boat carried him\non to reprobation, to damnation; and he suffered himself to be carried\npassively consenting, silently bidding farewell to his better self\nand his hopes. Huish sat by his side in towering spirits that were not\nwholly genuine. Perhaps as brave a man as ever lived, brave as a weasel,\nhe must still reassure himself with the tones of his own voice; he must\nplay his part to exaggeration, he must out-Herod Herod, insult all\nthat was respectable, and brave all that was formidable, in a kind of\ndesperate wager with himself.\n\n'Golly, but it's 'ot!' said he. 'Cruel 'ot, I call it. Nice d'y to get\nyour gruel in! I s'y, you know, it must feel awf'ly peculiar to get\nbowled over on a d'y like this. I'd rather 'ave it on a cowld and frosty\nmorning, wouldn't you? (Singing) \"'Ere we go round the mulberry bush\non a cowld and frosty mornin'.\" (Spoken) Give you my word, I 'aven't\nthought o' that in ten year; used to sing it at a hinfant school in\n'Ackney, 'Ackney Wick it was. (Singing) \"This is the way the tyler does,\nthe tyler does.\" (Spoken) Bloomin' 'umbug. 'Ow are you off now, for the\nnotion of a future styte? Do you cotton to the tea-fight views, or the\nold red 'ot boguey business?'\n\n'Oh, dry up!' said the captain.\n\n'No, but I want to know,' said Huish. 'It's within the sp'ere of\npractical politics for you and me, my boy; we may both be bowled over,\none up, t'other down, within the next ten minutes. It would be rather a\nlark, now, if you only skipped across, came up smilin' t'other side,\nand a hangel met you with a B. and S. under his wing. 'Ullo, you'd s'y:\ncome, I tyke this kind.'\n\nThe captain groaned. While Huish was thus airing and exercising his\nbravado, the man at his side was actually engaged in prayer. Prayer,\nwhat for? God knows. But out of his inconsistent, illogical, and\nagitated spirit, a stream of supplication was poured forth, inarticulate\nas himself, earnest as death and judgment.\n\n'Thou Gawd seest me!' continued Huish. 'I remember I had that written\nin my Bible. I remember the Bible too, all about Abinadab and parties.\nWell, Gawd!' apostrophising the meridian, 'you're goin' to see a rum\nstart presently, I promise you that!'\n\nThe captain bounded.\n\n'I'll have no blasphemy!' he cried, 'no blasphemy in my boat.'\n\n'All right, cap,' said Huish. 'Anythink to oblige. Any other topic you\nwould like to sudgest, the rynegyge, the lightnin' rod, Shykespeare, or\nthe musical glasses? 'Ere's conversation on a tap. Put a penny in the\nslot, and... 'ullo! 'ere they are!' he cried. 'Now or never is 'e goin'\nto shoot?'\n\nAnd the little man straightened himself into an alert and dashing\nattitude, and looked steadily at the enemy. But the captain rose half up\nin the boat with eyes protruding.\n\n'What's that?' he cried.\n\n'Wot's wot?' said Huish.\n\n'Those--blamed things,' said the captain.\n\nAnd indeed it was something strange. Herrick and Attwater, both armed\nwith Winchesters, had appeared out of the grove behind the figure-head;\nand to either hand of them, the sun glistened upon two metallic objects,\nlocomotory like men, and occupying in the economy of these creatures the\nplaces of heads--only the heads were faceless. To Davis between wind\nand water, his mythology appeared to have come alive, and Tophet to be\nvomiting demons. But Huish was not mystified a moment.\n\n'Divers' 'elmets, you ninny. Can't you see?' he said.\n\n'So they are,' said Davis, with a gasp. 'And why? Oh, I see, it's for\narmour.'\n\n'Wot did I tell you?' said Huish. 'Dyvid and Goliar all the w'y and\nback.'\n\nThe two natives (for they it was that were equipped in this unusual\npanoply of war) spread out to right and left, and at last lay down\nin the shade, on the extreme flank of the position. Even now that the\nmystery was explained, Davis was hatefully preoccupied, stared at the\nflame on their crests, and forgot, and then remembered with a smile, the\nexplanation.\n\nAttwater withdrew again into the grove, and Herrick, with his gun under\nhis arm, came down the pier alone.\n\nAbout half-way down he halted and hailed the boat.\n\n'What do you want?' he cried.\n\n'I'll tell that to Mr Attwater,' replied Huish, stepping briskly on the\nladder. 'I don't tell it to you, because you played the trucklin' sneak.\nHere's a letter for him: tyke it, and give it, and be 'anged to you!'\n\n'Davis, is this all right?' said Herrick.\n\nDavis raised his chin, glanced swiftly at Herrick and away again, and\nheld his peace. The glance was charged with some deep emotion, but\nwhether of hatred or of fear, it was beyond Herrick to divine.\n\n'Well,' he said, 'I'll give the letter.' He drew a score with his foot\non the boards of the gangway. 'Till I bring the answer, don't move a\nstep past this.'\n\nAnd he returned to where Attwater leaned against a tree, and gave him\nthe letter. Attwater glanced it through.\n\n'What does that mean?' he asked, passing it to Herrick.\n\n'Treachery?'\n\n'Oh, I suppose so!' said Herrick.\n\n'Well, tell him to come on,' said Attwater. 'One isn't a fatalist for\nnothing. Tell him to come on and to look out.'\n\nHerrick returned to the figure-head. Half-way down the pier the clerk\nwas waiting, with Davis by his side.\n\n'You are to come along, Huish,' said Herrick. 'He bids you look out, no\ntricks.'\n\nHuish walked briskly up the pier, and paused face to face with the young\nman.\n\n'W'ere is 'e?' said he, and to Herrick's surprise, the low-bred,\ninsignificant face before him flushed suddenly crimson and went white\nagain.\n\n'Right forward,' said Herrick, pointing. 'Now your hands above your\nhead.'\n\nThe clerk turned away from him and towards the figure-head, as though he\nwere about to address to it his devotions; he was seen to heave a deep\nbreath; and raised his arms. In common with many men of his unhappy\nphysical endowments, Huish's hands were disproportionately long and\nbroad, and the palms in particular enormous; a four-ounce jar was\nnothing in that capacious fist. The next moment he was plodding steadily\nforward on his mission.\n\nHerrick at first followed. Then a noise in his rear startled him, and he\nturned about to find Davis already advanced as far as the figure-head.\nHe came, crouching and open-mouthed, as the mesmerised may follow the\nmesmeriser; all human considerations, and even the care of his own life,\nswallowed up in one abominable and burning curiosity.\n\n'Halt!' cried Herrick, covering him with his rifle. 'Davis, what are you\ndoing, man? YOU are not to come.'\n\nDavis instinctively paused, and regarded him with a dreadful vacancy of\neye.\n\n'Put your back to that figure-head, do you hear me? and stand fast!'\nsaid Herrick.\n\nThe captain fetched a breath, stepped back against the figure-head, and\ninstantly redirected his glances after Huish.\n\nThere was a hollow place of the sand in that part, and, as it were,\na glade among the cocoa palms in which the direct noonday sun blazed\nintolerably. At the far end, in the shadow, the tall figure of Attwater\nwas to be seen leaning on a tree; towards him, with his hands over his\nhead, and his steps smothered in the sand, the clerk painfully waded.\nThe surrounding glare threw out and exaggerated the man's smallness; it\nseemed no less perilous an enterprise, this that he was gone upon, than\nfor a whelp to besiege a citadel.\n\n'There, Mr Whish. That will do,' cried Attwater. 'From that distance,\nand keeping your hands up, like a good boy, you can very well put me in\npossession of the skipper's views.'\n\nThe interval betwixt them was perhaps forty feet; and Huish measured\nit with his eye, and breathed a curse. He was already distressed with\nlabouring in the loose sand, and his arms ached bitterly from their\nunnatural position. In the palm of his right hand, the jar was ready;\nand his heart thrilled, and his voice choked as he began to speak.\n\n'Mr Hattwater,' said he, 'I don't know if ever you 'ad a mother...'\n\n'I can set your mind at rest: I had,' returned Attwater; 'and\nhenceforth, if I might venture to suggest it, her name need not recur in\nour communications. I should perhaps tell you that I am not amenable to\nthe pathetic.'\n\n'I am sorry, sir, if I 'ave seemed to tresparse on your private\nfeelin's,' said the clerk, cringing and stealing a step. 'At least, sir,\nyou will never pe'suade me that you are not a perfec' gentleman; I\nknow a gentleman when I see him; and as such, I 'ave no 'esitation in\nthrowin' myself on your merciful consideration. It IS 'ard lines, no\ndoubt; it's 'ard lines to have to hown yourself beat; it's 'ard lines to\n'ave to come and beg to you for charity.'\n\n'When, if things had only gone right, the whole place was as good as\nyour own?' suggested Attwater. 'I can understand the feeling.'\n\n'You are judging me, Mr Attwater,' said the clerk, 'and God knows how\nunjustly! THOU GAWD SEEST ME, was the tex' I 'ad in my Bible, w'ich my\nfather wrote it in with 'is own 'and upon the fly leaft.'\n\n'I am sorry I have to beg your pardon once more,' said Attwater; 'but,\ndo you know, you seem to me to be a trifle nearer, which is entirely\noutside of our bargain. And I would venture to suggest that you take\none--two--three--steps back; and stay there.'\n\nThe devil, at this staggering disappointment, looked out of Huish's\nface, and Attwater was swift to suspect. He frowned, he stared on the\nlittle man, and considered. Why should he be creeping nearer? The next\nmoment, his gun was at his shoulder.\n\n'Kindly oblige me by opening your hands. Open your hands wide--let me\nsee the fingers spread, you dog--throw down that thing you're holding!'\nhe roared, his rage and certitude increasing together.\n\nAnd then, at almost the same moment, the indomitable Huish decided to\nthrow, and Attwater pulled the trigger. There was scarce the difference\nof a second between the two resolves, but it was in favour of the man\nwith the rifle; and the jar had not yet left the clerk's hand, before\nthe ball shattered both. For the twinkling of an eye the wretch was in\nhell's agonies, bathed in liquid flames, a screaming bedlamite; and then\na second and more merciful bullet stretched him dead.\n\nThe whole thing was come and gone in a breath. Before Herrick could turn\nabout, before Davis could complete his cry of horror, the clerk lay in\nthe sand, sprawling and convulsed.\n\nAttwater ran to the body; he stooped and viewed it; he put his finger in\nthe vitriol, and his face whitened and hardened with anger.\n\nDavis had not yet moved; he stood astonished, with his back to the\nfigure-head, his hands clutching it behind him, his body inclined\nforward from the waist.\n\nAttwater turned deliberately and covered him with his rifle.\n\n'Davis,' he cried, in a voice like a trumpet, 'I give you sixty seconds\nto make your peace with God!'\n\nDavis looked, and his mind awoke. He did not dream of self-defence, he\ndid not reach for his pistol. He drew himself up instead to face death,\nwith a quivering nostril.\n\n'I guess I'll not trouble the Old Man,' he said; 'considering the job I\nwas on, I guess it's better business to just shut my face.'\n\nAttwater fired; there came a spasmodic movement of the victim, and\nimmediately above the middle of his forehead, a black hole marred the\nwhiteness of the figure-head. A dreadful pause; then again the report,\nand the solid sound and jar of the bullet in the wood; and this time the\ncaptain had felt the wind of it along his cheek. A third shot, and he\nwas bleeding from one ear; and along the levelled rifle Attwater smiled\nlike a Red Indian.\n\nThe cruel game of which he was the puppet was now clear to Davis; three\ntimes he had drunk of death, and he must look to drink of it seven times\nmore before he was despatched. He held up his hand.\n\n'Steady!' he cried; 'I'll take your sixty seconds.'\n\n'Good!' said Attwater.\n\nThe captain shut his eyes tight like a child: he held his hands up at\nlast with a tragic and ridiculous gesture.\n\n'My God, for Christ's sake, look after my two kids,' he said; and then,\nafter a pause and a falter, 'for Christ's sake, Amen.'\n\nAnd he opened his eyes and looked down the rifle with a quivering mouth.\n\n'But don't keep fooling me long!' he pleaded.\n\n'That's all your prayer?' asked Attwater, with a singular ring in his\nvoice.\n\n'Guess so,' said Davis.\n\nSo?' said Attwater, resting the butt of his rifle on the ground, 'is\nthat done? Is your peace made with Heaven? Because it is with me. Go,\nand sin no more, sinful father. And remember that whatever you do to\nothers, God shall visit it again a thousand-fold upon your innocents.'\n\nThe wretched Davis came staggering forward from his place against the\nfigure-head, fell upon his knees, and waved his hands, and fainted.\n\nWhen he came to himself again, his head was on Attwater's arm, and close\nby stood one of the men in divers' helmets, holding a bucket of water,\nfrom which his late executioner now laved his face. The memory of that\ndreadful passage returned upon him in a clap; again he saw Huish lying\ndead, again he seemed to himself to totter on the brink of an unplumbed\neternity. With trembling hands he seized hold of the man whom he had\ncome to slay; and his voice broke from him like that of a child among\nthe nightmares of fever: 'O! isn't there no mercy? O! what must I do to\nbe saved?'\n\n'Ah!' thought Attwater, 'here's the true penitent.'\n\n\n\nChapter 12. TAIL-PIECE\n\nOn a very bright, hot, lusty, strongly blowing noon, a fortnight after\nthe events recorded, and a month since the curtain rose upon this\nepisode, a man might have been spied, praying on the sand by the lagoon\nbeach. A point of palm trees isolated him from the settlement; and from\nthe place where he knelt, the only work of man's hand that interrupted\nthe expanse, was the schooner Farallone, her berth quite changed, and\nrocking at anchor some two miles to windward in the midst of the lagoon.\nThe noise of the Trade ran very boisterous in all parts of the island;\nthe nearer palm trees crashed and whistled in the gusts, those farther\noff contributed a humming bass like the roar of cities; and yet, to any\nman less absorbed, there must have risen at times over this turmoil\nof the winds, the sharper note of the human voice from the settlement.\nThere all was activity. Attwater, stripped to his trousers and lending\na strong hand of help, was directing and encouraging five Kanakas; from\nhis lively voice, and their more lively efforts, it was to be gathered\nthat some sudden and joyful emergency had set them in this bustle; and\nthe Union Jack floated once more on its staff. But the suppliant on the\nbeach, unconscious of their voices, prayed on with instancy and fervour,\nand the sound of his voice rose and fell again, and his countenance\nbrightened and was deformed with changing moods of piety and terror.\n\nBefore his closed eyes, the skiff had been for some time tacking towards\nthe distant and deserted Farallone; and presently the figure of Herrick\nmight have been observed to board her, to pass for a while into the\nhouse, thence forward to the forecastle, and at last to plunge into the\nmain hatch. In all these quarters, his visit was followed by a coil of\nsmoke; and he had scarce entered his boat again and shoved off, before\nflames broke forth upon the schooner. They burned gaily; kerosene had\nnot been spared, and the bellows of the Trade incited the conflagration.\nAbout half way on the return voyage, when Herrick looked back, he beheld\nthe Farallone wrapped to the topmasts in leaping arms of fire, and\nthe voluminous smoke pursuing him along the face of the lagoon. In one\nhour's time, he computed, the waters would have closed over the stolen\nship.\n\nIt so chanced that, as his boat flew before the wind with much vivacity,\nand his eyes were continually busy in the wake, measuring the progress\nof the flames, he found himself embayed to the northward of the point\nof palms, and here became aware at the same time of the figure of Davis\nimmersed in his devotion. An exclamation, part of annoyance, part of\namusement, broke from him: and he touched the helm and ran the prow\nupon the beach not twenty feet from the unconscious devotee. Taking the\npainter in his hand, he landed, and drew near, and stood over him. And\nstill the voluble and incoherent stream of prayer continued unabated. It\nwas not possible for him to overhear the suppliant's petitions, which he\nlistened to some while in a very mingled mood of humour and pity: and\nit was only when his own name began to occur and to be conjoined with\nepithets, that he at last laid his hand on the captain's shoulder.\n\n'Sorry to interrupt the exercise,' said he; 'but I want you to look at\nthe Farallone.'\n\nThe captain scrambled to his feet, and stood gasping and staring. 'Mr\nHerrick, don't startle a man like that!' he said. 'I don't seem someways\nrightly myself since...' he broke off. 'What did you say anyway? O, the\nFarallone,' and he looked languidly out.\n\n'Yes,' said Herrick. 'There she burns! and you may guess from that what\nthe news is.'\n\n'The Trinity Hall, I guess,' said the captain.\n\n'The same,' said Herrick; 'sighted half an hour ago, and coming up hand\nover fist.'\n\n'Well, it don't amount to a hill of beans,' said the captain with a\nsigh.\n\n'O, come, that's rank ingratitude!' cried Herrick.\n\n'Well,' replied the captain, meditatively, 'you mayn't just see the way\nthat I view it in, but I'd 'most rather stay here upon this island. I\nfound peace here, peace in believing. Yes, I guess this island is about\ngood enough for John Davis.'\n\n'I never heard such nonsense!' cried Herrick. 'What! with all turning\nout in your favour the way it does, the Farallone wiped out, the crew\ndisposed of, a sure thing for your wife and family, and you, yourself,\nAttwater's spoiled darling and pet penitent!'\n\n'Now, Mr Herrick, don't say that,' said the captain gently; 'when you\nknow he don't make no difference between us. But, O! why not be one of\nus? why not come to Jesus right away, and let's meet in yon beautiful\nland? That's just the one thing wanted; just say, Lord, I believe, help\nthou mine unbelief! And He'll fold you in His arms. You see, I know!\nI've been a sinner myself!'\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Ebb-Tide, by \nRobert Louis Stevenson and Lloyde Osbourne\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE EBB-TIDE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1604.txt or 1604.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/6\/0\/1604\/\n\nProduced by Dianne Bean\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":268,"split":"train"}
