{"ori_id":"5762ca3fac281a1259c97e0bc3cab99c6f27745a","title":"The Getting of Wisdom","context":"The Getting of Wisdom\n Henry Handel Richardson was the pseudonym of Ethel Florence Lindesay Richardson, a writer who was born in 1870 to a reasonably well-off family which later fell on hard times. The author's family lived in various Victorian towns and from the age of 13 to 17 Richardson attended boarding school at the Presbyterian Ladies' College in Melbourne, Victoria. It's this experience that feeds directly into The Getting of Wisdom.\nLaura Tweedle Rambotham, the main character, is the eldest child of a country family. She is a clever and highly imaginative child, given to inventing romantic stories for the entertainment of her younger siblings, and an avid reader. She is also both proud and sensitive and her mother finds her difficult to handle. Her mother is the widow of a barrister who supports her family in genteel poverty on her earnings from embroidery. At the age of twelve Laura is sent off to boarding school in Melbourne. Her experiences at school shock and humiliate the unworldly Laura. The girls at the school are generally from rather wealthy families and those, like Laura, who come from less fortunate backgrounds learn very early not to divulge their circumstances for fear of ridicule. From time to time Laura lets little snippets of information about her family slip out, and she suffers for it.\nIn fact, these seem to be the main forces controlling the action of this book: fear of the judgements of one's peers, the desire to \"fit in\", embarrassment about one's family\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is shameful to have a mother who works for a living\u00e2\u0080\u0094and the desire to \"better\" oneself by belittling others. None of the girls in the school, nor the teachers for that matter, come across as anything but self-serving and boorish. Even Laura, who starts out so young and strong and idealistic, surrenders to the role expected of her. Essentially, this is a story about the destruction of innocence.\nLaura undergoes a form of redemption at the end of the book, convincing herself that cheating in an exam is actually God's will, and then later deciding that while she was wrong to do so, she got away with it and therefore God had no actual hand in the matter or else he would have punished her for the sin. A neat case of self-delusion. At the end, when Laura is walking away from the school for the last time, she is overcome with a desire to run, and the last we see of her is a rapidly diminishing form disappearing through a park. She is free at last: free of the overwhelming constrictions of the school, the teachers' expectations and the other schoolgirls' callous disregard.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's The Getting of Wisdom, by Henry Handel Richardson\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

And there he saw\na lady, a beautiful lady, in a long white dress that hung down to her\nankles, with a golden belt and a golden crown. She was lying on the\nsward--a sward, you know, is grass as smooth as velvet, just like green\nvelvet--and the Prince saw the marks of travel on her garments. The\nbottom of the lovely silk dress was all dirty----\"\n\n\"Wondrous Fair, if you don't mind you'll make that sheet dirty, too,\"\nsaid Pin.\n\n\"Shut up, will you!\" answered her sister who, carried away by her\nnarrative, had approached her boots to some linen that was bleaching.\n\n\"Yes, but you know Sarah'll be awfly cross if she has to wash it\nagain,\" said Pin, who was practical.\n\n\"You'll put me out altogether,\" cried Laura angrily.--\"Well, as I said,\nthe edge of her robe was all muddy--no, I don't think I will say that;\nit sounds prettier if it's clean. So it hung in long, straight\nbeautiful folds to her ankles, and the Prince saw two little feet in\ngolden sandals peeping out from under the hem of the silken gown,\nand----\"\n\n\"But what about the marks of travel?\" asked Leppie.\n\n\"Donkey! haven't I said they weren't there? If I say they weren't, then\nthey weren't. She hadn't travelled at all.\"\n\n\"Oh, parrakeets!\" cried little Frank.\n\nFour pairs of eyes went up to the bright green flock that was passing\nover the garden.\n\n\"Now you've all interrupted, and I shan't tell any more,\" said Laura in\na proud voice.\n\n\"Oh, yes, please do, Wondrous Fair! Tell what happened next,\" begged\nPin and Leppie.\n\n\"No, not another word. You can only think of sheets and parrakeets.\"\n\n\"Please, Wondrous Fair,\" begged little Frank.\n\n\"No, I can't now.--Another thing: I don't mind if you call me Laura\nto-day, as it's the last day.\"\n\nShe lay back on the grass, her hands clasped under her head. A voice\nwas heard, loud, imperative.\n\n\"Laura, I want you. Come here.\"\n\n\"That's mother calling,\" said Pin.\n\nLaura kicked her heels. The two little boys laughed approval.\n\n\"Go on, Laura,\" coaxed Pin. \"Mother'll be angry. I'll come, too.\"\n\nLaura raised herself with a grumble. \"It's to try on that horrid dress.\"\n\nIn very fact Mother was standing, already somewhat impatient, with the\ndress in her hand. Laura wriggled out of the one she had on, and stood\nstiffly and ungraciously, with her arms held like pokers from her\nsides, while Mother on her knees arranged the length.\n\n\"Don't put on a face like that, miss!\" she said sharply on seeing\nLaura's air. \"Do you think I'm making it for my own pleasure?\" She had\nsewn at it all day, and was hot and tired.\n\n\"It's too short,\" said Laura, looking down.\n\n\"It's nothing of the kind,\" said Mother, with her mouth full of pins.\n\n\"It is, it's much too short.\"\n\nMother gave her a slight shake. \"Don't you contradict ME! Do you want\nto tell me I don't know what length you're to wear your dresses?\"\n\n\"I won't wear it at all if you don't make it longer,\" said Laura\ndefiantly.\n\nPin's chubby, featureless little face lengthened with apprehension.\n\n\"Do let her have it just a tiny bit longer, mother dear, dear!\" she\npleaded.\n\n\"Now, Pin, what have you got to do with it I'd like to know!\" said\nMother, on the verge of losing her temper over the back folds, which\nWOULD not hang.\n\n\"I'm going to school to-morrow, and it's a shame,\" said Laura in the\nlow, passionate tone that never failed to exasperate Mother, so\ndifferent was it from her own hearty fashion of venting displeasure.\nPin began to sniff, in sheer nervous anxiety.\n\n\"Very well then, I won't do another stitch to it!\" and Mother, now\nangry in earnest, got up and bounced out of the room.\n\n\"Laura, how can you?\" said Pin, dissolving. \"It's only you who make her\nso cross.\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" said Laura rebelliously, though she was not far off\ntears herself. \"It IS a shame. All the other girls will have dresses\ndown to the tops of their boots, and they'll laugh at me, and call me a\n[P.4] baby;\" and touched by the thought of what lay before her, she,\ntoo, began to sniffle. She did not fail, however, to roll the dress up\nand to throw it unto a corner of the room. She also kicked the ewer,\nwhich fell over and flooded the floor. Pin cried more loudly, and ran\nto fetch Sarah.\n\nLaura returned to the garden. The two little boys came up to her; but\nshe waved them back.\n\n\"Let me alone, children. I want to think.\"\n\nShe stood in a becoming attitude by the garden-gate, her brothers\nhovering in the background.--Then Mother called once more.\n\n\"Laura, where are you?\"\n\n\"Here, mother. What is it?\"\n\n\"Did you knock this jug over or did Pin?\"\n\n\"I did, mother.\"\n\n\"Did you do it on purpose?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Come here to me.\"\n\nShe went, with lagging steps. But Mother's anger had passed: she was at\nwork on the dress again, and by squinting her eyes Laura could see that\na piece was being added to the skirt. She was penitent at once; and\nwhen Mother in a sorry voice said: \"I'm ashamed of you, Laura. And on\nyour last day, too,\" her throat grew narrow.\n\n\"I didn't mean it, mother.\"\n\n\"If only you would ask properly for things, you would get them.\"\n\nLaura knew this; knew indeed that, did she coax, Mother could refuse\nher nothing. But coaxing came hard to her; something within her forbade\nit. Sarah called her \"high-stomached\", to the delight of the other\nchildren and her own indignation; she had explained to them again and\nagain what Sarah really meant.\n\nOn leaving the house she went straight to the flower-beds: she would\ngive Mother, who liked flowers very well but had no time to gather\nthem, a bouquet the size of a cabbage. Pin and the boys were summoned\nto help her, and when their hands were full, Laura led the way to a\nsecluded part of the garden on the farther side of the detached brick\nkitchen. In this strip, which was filled with greenery, little sun\nfell: two thick fir trees and a monstrous blue-gum stood there; high\nbushes screened the fence; jessamine climbed the wall of the house and\nencircled the bedroom windows; and on the damp and shady ground only\nviolets grew. Yet, with the love children bear to the limited and\ncompact, the four had chosen their own little plots here rather than in\nthe big garden at the back of the house; and many were the times they\nhad all begun anew to dig and to rake. But if Laura's energy did not\nfizzle out as quickly as usual--she was the model for the rest--Mother\nwas sure to discover that it was too cramped and dark for them in\nthere, and send Sarah to drive them off.\n\nHere, safely screened from sight, Laura sat on a bench and made up her\nbouquet. When it was finished--red and white in the centre with a\ndarker border, the whole surrounded by a ring of violet leaves--she\nlooked about for something to tie it up with. Sarah, applied to, was\nbusy ironing, and had no string in the kitchen, so Pin ran to get a\nreel of cotton. But while she was away Laura had an idea. Bidding\nLeppie hold the flowers tight in both his sticky little hands, she\nclimbed in at her bedroom window, or rather, by lying on the sill with\nher legs waving in the air, she managed to grab, without losing her\nbalance, a pair of scissors from the chest of drawers. With these\nbetween her teeth she emerged, to the excited interest of the boys who\nwatched her open-mouthed.\n\nLaura had dark curls, Pin fair, and both wore them flapping at their\nbacks, the only difference being that Laura, who was now twelve years\nold, had for the past year been allowed to bind hers together with a\nribbon, while Pin's bobbed as they chose. Every morning early, Mother\nbrushed and twisted, with a kind of grim pride, these silky ringlets\nround her finger. Although the five odd minutes the curling occupied\nwere durance vile to Laura, the child was proud of her hair in her own\nway; and when in the street she heard some one say: \"Look--what pretty\ncurls!\" she would give her head a toss and send them all a-rippling. In\naddition to this, there was a crowning glory connected with them: one\nhot December morning, when they had been tangled and Mother had kept\nher standing too long, she had fainted, pulling the whole\ndressing-table down about her ears; and ever since, she had been marked\noff in some mysterious fashion from the other children. Mother would\nnot let her go out at midday in summer: Sarah would say: \"Let that be,\ncan't you!\" did she try to lift something that was too heavy for her;\nand the younger children were to be quelled by a threat to faint on the\nspot, if they did not do as she wished. \"Laura's faint\" had become a\nbyword in the family; and Laura herself held it for so important a fact\nin her life that she had more than once begun a friendship with the\nwords: \"Have you ever fainted? I have.\"\n\nFrom among these long, glossy curls, she now cut one of the longest and\nmost spiral, cut it off close to the root, and with it bound the\nflowers together. Mother should see that she did know how to give up\nsomething she cared for, and was not as selfish as she was usually\nsupposed to be.\n\n\"Oh .. h .. h!\" said both little boys in a breath, then doubled up in\nnoisy mirth. Laura was constantly doing something to set their young\nblood in amazement: they looked upon her as the personification of all\nthat was startling and unexpected. But Pin, returning with the reel of\nthread, opened her eyes in a different way.\n\n\"Oh, Laura ...!\" she began, tearful at once.\n\n\"Now, res'vor!\" retorted Laura scornfully--\"res'vor\" was Sarah's name\nfor Pin, on account of her perpetual wateriness. \"Be a cry-baby, do.\"\nBut she was not damped, she was lost in the pleasure of self-sacrifice.\n\nPin looked after her as she danced off, then moved submissively in her\nwake to be near at hand should intercession be needed. Laura was so\nunsuspecting, and Mother would be so cross. In her dim, childish way\nPin longed to see these, her two nearest, at peace; she understood them\nboth so well, and they had little or no understanding for each\nother.--So she crept to the house at her sister's heels.\n\nLaura did not go indoors; hiding against the wall of the flagged\nverandah, she threw her bouquet in at the window, meaning it to fall on\nMother's lap.\n\nBut Mother had dropped her needle, and was just lifting her face,\nflushed with stooping, when the flowers hit her a thwack on the head.\nShe groped again, impatiently, to find what had struck her, recognised\nthe peace-offering, and thought of the surprise cake that was to go\ninto Laura's box on the morrow. Then she saw the curl, and her face\ndarkened. Was there ever such a tiresome child? What in all the world\nwould she do next?\n\n\"Laura, come here, directly!\"\n\nLaura had moved away; she was not expecting recognition. If Mother were\npleased she would call Pin to put the flowers in water for her, and\nthat would be the end of it. The idea of a word of thanks would have\nmade Laura feel uncomfortable. Now, however, at the tone of Mother's\nvoice, her mouth set stubbornly. She went indoors as bidden, but was\nalready up in arms again.\n\n\"You're a very naughty girl indeed!\" began Mother as soon she appeared.\n\"How dare you cut off your hair? Upon my word, if it weren't your last\nnight I'd send you to bed without any supper!\"--an unheard-of threat on\nthe part of Mother, who punished her children in any way but that of\ndenying them their food. \"It's a very good thing you're leaving home\nto-morrow, for you'd soon be setting the others at defiance, too, and I\nshould have four naughty children on my hands instead of one.-- But I'd\nbe ashamed to go to school such a fright if I were you. Turn round at\nonce and let me see you!\"\n\nLaura turned, with a sinking heart. Pin cried softly in a corner.\n\n\"She thought it would please you, mother,\" she sobbed.\n\n\"I WILL not have you interfering, Pin, when I'm speaking to Laura.\nShe's old enough by now to know what I like and what I don't,\" said\nMother, who was vexed at the thought of the child going among strangers\nthus disfigured.--\"And now get away, and don't let me see you again.\nYou're a perfect sight.\"\n\n\"Oh, Laura, you do look funny!\" said Leppie and Frank in weak chorus,\nas she passed them in the passage.\n\n\"Well, you 'ave made a guy of yourself this time, Miss Laura, and no\nmistake!\" said Sarah, who had heard the above.\n\nLaura went into her own room and locked the door, a thing Mother did\nnot allow. Then she threw herself on the bed and cried. Mother had not\nunderstood in the least; and she had made herself a sight into the\nbargain. She refused to open the door, though one after another rattled\nthe handle, and Sarah threatened to turn the hose in at the window. So\nthey left her alone, and she spent the evening in watery dudgeon on her\npillow. But before she undressed for the night she stealthily made a\nchink and took in the slice of cake Pin had left on the door-mat. Her\nnatural buoyancy of spirit was beginning to reassert itself. By\nbrushing her hair well to one side she could cover up the gap, she\nfound; and after all, there was something rather pleasant in knowing\nthat you were misunderstood. It made you feel different from everyone\nelse.\n\nMother--sewing hard after even the busy Sarah had retired--Mother\nsmiled a stern little smile of amusement to herself; and before locking\nup for the night put the dark curl safely away.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\n\nLaura, sleeping flat on her stomach, was roused next morning by Pin who\nsaid:\n\n\"Wake up, Wondrous Fair, mother wants to speak to you. She says you can\nget into bed in my place, before you dress.\" Pin slept warm and cosy at\nMother's side.\n\nLaura rose on her elbow and looked at her sister: Pin was standing in\nthe doorway holding her nightgown to her, in such a way as to expose\nall of her thin little legs.\n\n\"Come on,\" urged Pin. \"Sarah's going to give me my bath while you're\nwith mother.\"\n\n\"Go away, Pin,\" said Laura snappily. \"I told you yesterday you could\nsay Laura, and ... and you're more like a spider than ever.\"\n\n\"Spider\" was another nickname for Pin, owed to her rotund little body\nand mere sticks of legs--she was \"all belly\" as Sarah put it--and the\nmere mention of it made Pin fly; for she was very touchy about her legs.\n\nAs soon as the door closed behind her, Laura sprang out of bed and,\nwaiting neither to wash herself nor to say her prayers, began to pull\non her clothes, confusing strings and buttons in her haste, and quite\nforgetting that on this eventful morning she had meant to dress herself\nwith more than ordinary care. She was just lacing her shoes when Sarah\nlooked in.\n\n\"Why, Miss Laura, don't you know your ma wants you?\"\n\n\"It's too late. I'm dressed now,\" said Laura darkly.\n\nSarah shook her head. \"Missis'll be fine an' angry. An' you needn't\n'ave 'ad a row on your last day.\"\n\nLaura stole out of the door and ran down the garden to the\nsummer-house. This, the size of a goodly room, was formed of a single\ndense, hairy-leafed tree, round the trunk of which a seat was built.\nHere she cowered, her elbows on her knees, her chin in her hands. Her\nface wore the stiff expression that went by the name of \"Laura's\nsulks,\" but her eyes were big, and as watchful as those of a scared\nanimal. If Sarah came to fetch her she would hold on to the seat with\nboth hands. But even if she had to yield to Sarah's greater\nstrength--well, at least she was up and dressed. Not like the last\ntime--about a week ago Mother had tried this kind of thing. Then, she\nhad been caught unawares. She had gone into Pin's warm place, curious\nand unsuspecting, and thereupon Mother had begun to talk seriously to\nher, and not with her usual directness. She had reminded Laura that she\nwas growing up apace and would soon be a woman; had told her that she\nmust now begin to give up childish habits, and learn to behave in a\nmodest and womanly way--all disagreeable, disturbing things, which\nLaura did not in the least want to hear. When it became clear to her\nwhat it was about, she had thrown back the bedclothes and escaped from\nthe room. And since then she had been careful never to be long alone\nwith Mother.\n\nBut now half an hour went by and no one came to fetch her: her grim\nlittle face relaxed. She felt very hungry, too, and when at length she\nheard Pin calling, she jumped up and betrayed her hiding-place.\n\n\"Laura! Laura, where are you? Mother says to come to breakfast and not\nbe silly. The coach'll be here in an hour.\"\n\nTaking hands the sisters ran to the house.\n\nIn the passage, Sarah was busy roping a battered tin box. With their\nown hands the little boys had been allowed to paste on this a big sheet\nof notepaper, which bore, in Mother's writing, the words:\n\nMiss Laura Tweedle Rambotham The Ladies' College Melbourne.\n\nMother herself was standing at the breakfast-table cutting sandwiches.\n\n\"Come and eat your breakfast, child,\" was all she said at the moment.\n\"The tea's quite cold.\"\n\nLaura sat down and fell to with appetite, but also with a side-glance\nat the generous pile of bread and meat growing under Mother's hands.\n\n\"I shall never eat all that,\" she said ungraciously; it galled her\nstill to be considered a greedy child with an insatiable stomach.\n\n\"I know better than you do what you'll eat,\" said Mother. \"You'll be\nhungry enough by this evening I can tell you, not getting any dinner.\"\n\nPin's face fell at this prospect. \"Oh, mother, won't she really get any\ndinner?\" she asked: and to her soft little heart going to school began\nto seem one of the blackest experiences life held.\n\n\"Why, she'll be in the train, stupid, 'ow can she?\" said Sarah. \"Do you\nthink trains give you dinners?\"\n\n\"Oh, mother, please cut ever such a lot!\" begged Pin sniffing valiantly.\n\nLaura began to feel somewhat moved herself at this solicitude, and\nchoked down a lump in her throat with a gulp of tea. But when Pin had\ngone with Sarah to pick some nectarines, Mother's face grew stern, and\nLaura's emotion passed.\n\n\"I feel more troubled about you than I can say, Laura. I don't know how\nyou'll ever get on in life--you're so disobedient and self-willed. It\nwould serve you very well right, I'm sure, for not coming this morning,\nif I didn't give you a penny of pocket-money to take to school.\"\n\nLaura had heard this threat before, and thought it wiser not to reply.\nGobbling up the rest of her breakfast she slipped away.\n\nWith the other children at her heels she made a round of the garden,\nbidding good-bye to things and places. There were the two summer-houses\nin which she had played house; in which she had cooked and eaten and\nslept. There was the tall fir-tree with the rung-like branches by which\nshe had been accustomed to climb to the very tree-top; there was the\nwilderness of bamboo and cane where she had been Crusoe; the ancient,\nbroadleaved cactus on which she had scratched their names and drawn\ntheir portraits; here, the high aloe that had such a mysterious charm\nfor you, because you never knew when the hundred years might expire and\nthe aloe burst into flower. Here again was the old fig tree with the\nrounded, polished boughs, from which, seated as in a cradle, she had\nplayed Juliet to Pin's Romeo, and vice versa--but oftenest Juliet: for\nthough Laura greatly preferred to be the ardent lover at the foot, Pin\nwas but a poor climber, and, as she clung trembling to her branch,\nneeded so much prompting in her lines--even then to repeat them with\nsuch feeble emphasis--that Laura invariably lost patience with her and\nthe love-scene ended in a squabble. Passing behind a wooden fence which\nwas a tangle of passion-flower, she opened the door of the fowl-house,\nand out strutted the mother-hen followed by her pretty brood. Laura had\ngiven each of the chicks a name, and she now took Napoleon and\nGaribaldi up in her hand and laid her cheek against their downy\nbreasts, the younger children following her movements in respectful\nsilence. Between the bars of the rabbit hutch she thrust enough\ngreenstuff to last the two little occupants for days; and everywhere\nshe went she was accompanied by a legless magpie, which, in spite of\nits infirmity, hopped cheerily and quickly on its stumps. Laura had\nrescued it and reared it; it followed her like a dog; and she was only\nless devoted to it than she had been to a native bear which died under\nher hands.\n\n\"Now listen, children,\" she said as she rose from her knees before the\nhutch. \"If you don't look well after Maggy and the bunnies, I don't\nknow what I'll do. The chicks'll be all right. Sarah'll take care of\nthem, 'cause of the eggs. But Maggy and the bunnies don't have eggs,\nand if they're not fed, or if Frank treads on Maggy again, then they'll\ndie. Now if you let them die, I don't know what I'll do to you! Yes, I\ndo: I'll send the devil to you at night when the room's dark, before\nyou go to sleep.--So there!\"\n\n\"How can you if you're not here?\" asked Leppie.\n\nPin, however, who believed in ghosts and apparitions with all her\nfearful little heart, promised tremulously never, never to forget; but\nLaura was not satisfied until each of them in turn had repeated, in a\nlow voice, with the appropriate gestures, the sacred secret, and\nforbidden formula:\n\n  Is my finger wet?\n  Is my finger dry?\n  God'll strike me dead,\n  If I tell a lie.\n\n\nThen Sarah's voice was heard calling, and the boys went out into the\nroad to watch for the coach. Laura's dressing proved a lengthy\nbusiness, and was accomplished amid bustle, and scolding, and little\npeace-making words from Pin; for in her hurry that morning Laura had\nforgotten to put on the clean linen Mother had laid beside the bed, and\nconsequently had now to strip to the skin.\n\nThe boys announced the coming of the coach with shrill cries, and\nsimultaneously the rumble of wheels was heard. Sarah came from the\nkitchen drying her hands, and Pin began to cry.\n\n\"Now, shut up, res'vor!\" said Sarah roughly: her own eyes were moist.\n\"You don't see Miss Laura be such a silly-billy. Anyone 'ud think you\nwas goin', not 'er.\"\n\nThe ramshackle old vehicle, one of Cobb's Royal Mail Coaches,\nbig-bodied, lumbering, scarlet, pulled by two stout horses, drew up\nbefore the door, and the driver climbed down from his seat.\n\n\"Now good day to you, ma'am, good day, miss\"--this to Sarah who,\npicking up the box, handed it to him to be strapped on under the apron.\n\"Well, well, and so the little girl's goin' to school, is she? My, but\ntime flies! Well do I remember the day ma'am, when I drove you all\nacross for the first time. These children wasn't big enough then to git\nup and down be thimselves. Now I warrant you they can--just look at\n'em, will you?--But my! Ain't you ashamed of yourself\"--he spoke to\nPin--\"pipin' your eye like that? Why, you'll flood the road if you\ndon't hould on.--Yes, yes, ma'am, bless you, I'll look after her, and\nput her inter the train wid me own han's. Don't you be oneasy. The Lord\nhe cares for the widder and the orphun, and if He don't, why Patrick\nO'Donnell does.\"\n\nThis was O'Donnell's standing joke; he uttered it with a loud chuckle.\nWhile speaking he had let down the steps and helped the three children\nup--they were to ride with Laura to the outskirts of the township. The\nlittle boys giggled excitedly at his assertion that the horses would\nnot be equal to the weight. Only Pin wept on, in undiminished grief.\n\n\"Now, Miss Laura.\"\n\n\"Now, Laura. Good-bye, darling. And do try and be good. And be sure you\nwrite once a week. And tell me everything. Whether you are happy--and\nif you get enough to eat--and if you have enough blankets on your bed.\nAnd remember always to change your boots if you get your feet wet. And\ndon't lean out of the window in the train.\"\n\nFor some time past Laura had had need of all her self-control, not to\ncry before the children. As the hour drew near it had grown harder and\nharder; while dressing, she had resorted to counting the number of\ntimes the profile of a Roman emperor appeared in the flowers on the\nwallpaper. Now the worst moment of all was come--the moment of\ngood-bye. She did not look at Pin, but she heard her tireless, snuffly\nweeping, and set her own lips tight.\n\n\"Yes, mother ... no, mother,\" she answered shortly, \"I'll be all right.\nGood-bye.\" She could not, however, restrain a kind of dry sob, which\njumped up her throat.\n\nWhen she was in the coach Sarah, whom she had forgotten climbed up to\nkiss her; and there was some joking between O'Donnell and the servant\nwhile the steps were being folded and put away. Laura did not smile;\nher thin little face was very pale. Mother's heart went out to her in a\npity which she did not know how to express.\n\n\"Don't forget your sandwiches. And when you're alone, feel in the\npocket of your ulster and you'll find something nice. Good-bye,\ndarling.\"\n\n\"Good-bye ... good-bye.\"\n\nThe driver had mounted to his seat, he unwound the reins cried \"Get\nup!\" to the two burly horses, the vehicle was set in motion and\ntrundled down the main street. Until it turned the corner by the Shire\nGardens, Laura let her handkerchief fly from the window. Sarah waved\nhers; then wiped her eyes and lustily blew her nose. Mother only sighed.\n\n\"It was all she could do to keep up,\" she said as much to herself as to\nSarah. \"I do hope she'll be all right. She seems such a child to be\nsending off like this. Yet what else could I do? To a State School,\nI've always said it, my children shall never go--not if I have to beg\nthe money to send them elsewhere.\"\n\nBut she sighed again, in spite of the energy of her words, and stood\ngazing at the place where the coach had disappeared. She was still a\ncomparatively young woman, and straight of body; but trouble, poverty\nand night-watches had scored many lines on her forehead.\n\n\"Don't you worry,\" said Sarah. \"Miss Laura'll be all right. She's just\na bit too clever--brains for two, that's what it is. An' children WILL\ngrow up an' get big ... an' change their feathers.\" She spoke absently,\ndrawing her metaphor from a brood of chickens which had strayed across\nthe road, and was now trying to mount the wooden verandah--\"Shooh! Get\naway with you!\"\n\n\"I know that. But Laura--The other children have never given me a\nmoment's worry. But Laura's different. I seem to get less and less able\nto manage her. If only her father had been alive to help!\"\n\n\"I'm sure no father livin' could do more than you for those blessed\nchildren,\" said Sarah with impatience. \"You think of nothin' else. It\n'ud be a great deal better if you took more care o' yourself. You sit\nup nights an' don't get no proper sleep slavin' away at that blessed\nembroid'ry an' stuff, so as Miss Laura can get off to school an' to 'er\nbooks. An' then you want to worry over 'er as well.--She'll be all\nright. Miss Laura's like peas. You've got to get 'em outer the\npod--they're in there sure enough. An' b'sides I guess school'll knock\nall the nonsense out of 'er.\"\n\n\"Oh, I hope they won't be too hard on her,\" said Mother in quick\nalarm.--\"Shut the side gate, will you. Those children have left it open\nagain.--And, Sarah, I think we'll turn out the drawing-room.\"\n\nSarah grunted to herself as she went to close the gate. This had not\nentered into her scheme of work for the day, and her cooking was still\nundone. But she did not gainsay her mistress, as she otherwise would\nhave made no scruple of doing; for she knew that nothing was more\nhelpful to the latter in a crisis than hard, manual work. Besides,\nSarah herself had a sneaking weakness for what she called \"dra'in'-room\ndays\". For the drawing-room was the storehouse of what treasures had\nremained over from a past prosperity. It was crowded with bric-a-brac\nand ornament; and as her mistress took these objects up one by one, to\ndust and polish them, she would, if she were in a good humour, tell\nSarah where and how they had been bought, or describe the places they\nhad originally come from: so that Sarah, pausing broom in hand to\nlisten, had with time gathered some vague ideas of a country like\n\"Inja\", for example, whence came the little silver \"pagody\", and the\nexpressionless brass god who squatted vacantly and at ease.\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\n\nAs long as the coach rolled down the main street Laura sat bolt upright\nat the window. In fancy she heard people telling one another that this\nwas little Miss Rambotham going to school. She was particularly glad\nthat just as they went past the Commercial Hotel, Miss Perrotet, the\nlandlord's red-haired daughter, should put her fuzzy head out of the\nwindow--for Miss Perrotet had also been to boarding-school, and thought\nvery highly of herself in consequence, though it had only been for a\nyear, to finish. At the National Bank the manager's wife waved a\nfriendly hand to the children, and at the Royal Mail Hotel where they\ndrew up for passengers or commissions, Mrs. Paget, the stout landlady,\ncame out, smoothing down her black satin apron.\n\n\"Well, I'm sure I wonder your ma likes sendin' you off so alone.\"\n\nThe ride had comforted Pin a little; but when they had passed the chief\nstores and the flour-mill, and were come to a part of the road where\nthe houses were fewer, her tears broke out afresh. The very last house\nwas left behind, the high machinery of the claims came into view, the\nwatery flats where Chinamen were for ever rocking washdirt in cradles;\nand O'Donnell dismounted and opened the door. He lifted the three out\none by one, shaking his head in humorous dismay at Pin, and as little\nFrank showed sighs of beginning, too, by puckering up his face and\n[P.22] doubling up his body, the kindly man tried to make them laugh by\nasking if he had the stomach-ache. Laura had one more glimpse of the\nchildren standing hand in hand--even in her trouble Pin did not forget\nher charges--then a sharp bend in the road hid them from her sight.\n\nShe was alone in the capacious body of the coach, alone, and the proud\nexcitement of parting was over. The staunchly repressed tears welled up\nwith a gush, and flinging herself down across the seat she cried\nbitterly. It was not a childishly irresponsible grief like Pin's: it\nwas more passionate, and went deeper; and her overloaded feelings were\nsoon relieved. But as she was not used to crying, she missed the moment\nat which she might have checked herself, and went on shedding tears\nafter they had become a luxury.\n\n\"Why, goodness gracious, what's this?\" cried a loud, cheerful and\nastonished voice, and a fat, rosy face beamed in on Laura. \"Why, here's\na little girl in here, cryin' fit to break 'er heart. Come, come, my\ndear, what's the matter? Don't cry like that, now don't.\"\n\nThe coach had stopped, the door opened and a stout woman climbed in,\nbearing a big basket, and followed by a young man with straw-coloured\nwhiskers. Laura sat up like a dart and pulled her hat straight, crimson\nwith mortification at being discovered in such a plight. She had\ninstantly curbed her tears, but she could not disguise the fact that\nshe had red eyes and a swollen nose--that she was in short what Sarah\ncalled \"all bunged up\". She made no reply to the newcomer's\nexclamations, but sat clutching her handkerchief and staring out of the\nwindow. The woman's good-natured curiosity, however, was not to be done.\n\n\"You poor little thing, you!\" she persisted. \"Wherever are you goin',\nmy dear, so alone?\"\n\n\"I'm going to boarding-school,\" said Laura, and shot a glance at the\ncouple opposite.\n\n\"To boardin'-school? Peter! D'you hear?--Why, whatever's your ma\nthinkin' of to send such a little chick as you to boardin'-school? ...\nand so alone, too.\"\n\nLaura's face took on a curious air of dignity.\n\n\"I'm not so very little,\" she answered; and went on to explain, in\nphrases which she had heard so often that she knew them by heart: \"Only\nsmall for my age. I was twelve in spring. And I have to go to school,\nbecause I've learnt all I can at home.\"\n\nThis failed to impress the woman.\n\n\"Snakes alive!--that's young enough in all conscience. And such a\ndelicate little creature, too. Just like that one o' Sam MacFarlane's\nthat popped off last Christmas--isn't she, Peter?\"\n\nPeter, who avoided looking at Laura, sheepishly mumbled something about\nlike enough she was.\n\n\"And who IS your ma, my dear? What's your name?\" continued her\ninterrogator.\n\nLaura replied politely; but there was a reserve in her manner which,\ntogether with the name she gave, told enough: the widow, Laura's\nmother, had the reputation of being very \"stuck-up\", and of bringing up\nher children in the same way.\n\nThe woman did not press Laura further; she whispered something behind\nher hand to Peter, then searching in her basket found a large, red\napple, which she held out with an encouraging nod and smile.\n\n\"Here, my dear. Here's something for you. Don't cry any more, don't\nnow. It'll be all right.\"\n\nLaura, who was well aware that she had not shed a tear since the couple\nentered the coach, coloured deeply, and made a movement, half shy, half\nunwilling, to put her hands behind her.\n\n\"Oh no, thank you,\" she said in extreme embarrassment, not wishing to\nhurt the giver's feelings. \"Mother doesn't care for us to take things\nfrom strangers.\"\n\n\"Bless her soul!\" cried the stout woman in amaze. \"It's only an apple!\nNow, my dear, just you take it, and make your mind easy. Your ma\nwouldn't have nothin' against it to-day, I'm sure o' that--goin' away\nso far and all so alone like this.--It's sweet and juicy.\"\n\n\"It's Melb'm you'll be boun' for I dessay?\" said the yellow-haired\nPeter so suddenly that Laura started.\n\nShe confirmed this, and let her solemn eyes rest on him wondering why\nhe was so red and fidgety and uncomfortable. The woman said: \"Tch, tch,\ntch!\" at the length of the journey Laura was undertaking, and Peter,\ngrowing still redder, volunteered another remark.\n\n\"I was nigh to bein' in Melb'm once meself,\" he said.\n\n\"Aye, and he can't never forget it, the silly loon,\" threw in the\nwoman, but so good-naturedly that it was impossible, Laura felt, for\nPeter to take offence.\n\nShe gazed at the pair, speculating upon the relation they stood in to\neach other. She had obediently put out her hand for the apple, and now\nsat holding it, without attempting to eat it. It had not been Mother's\nprecepts alone that had weighed with her in declining it; she was\nmortified at the idea of being bribed, as it were, to be good, just as\nthough she were Pin or one of the little boys. It was a punishment on\nher for having been so babyish as to cry; had she not been caught in\nthe act, the woman would never have ventured to be so familiar.--The\nvery largeness and rosiness of the fruit made it hateful to her, and\nshe turned over in her mind how she could get rid of it.\n\nAs the coach bumped along, her fellow-passengers sat back and shut\ntheir eyes. The road was shadeless; beneath the horses' feet a thick\nred dust rose like smoke. The grass by the wayside, under the scattered\ngum trees or round the big black boulders that dotted the hillocks, was\nburnt to straw. In time, Laura also grew drowsy, and she was just\nfalling into a doze when, with a jerk, the coach pulled up at the\n\"Halfway House.\" Here her companions alighted, and there were more nods\nand smiles from the woman.\n\n\"You eat it, my dear. I'm sure your ma won't say nothin',\" was her last\nremark as she pushed the swing-door and vanished into the house,\nfollowed by Peter.\n\nThen the driver's pleasant face appeared at the window of the coach. In\none hand he held a glass, in the other a bottle of lemonade.\n\n\"Here, little woman, have a drink. It's warm work ridin'.\"\n\nNow this was quite different from the matter of the apple. Laura's\nthroat was parched with dust and tears. She accepted the offer\ngratefully, thinking as she drank how envious Pin would be, could she\nsee her drinking bottle-lemonade.\n\nThen the jolting and rumbling began anew. No one else got in, and when\nthey had passed the only two landmarks she knew--the leprous Chinaman's\nhut and the market garden of Ah Chow, who twice a week jaunted at a\nhalf-trot to the township with his hanging baskets, to supply people\nwith vegetables--when they had passed these, Laura fell asleep. She\nwakened with a start to find that the coach had halted to apply the\nbrakes, at the top of the precipitous hill that led down to the railway\ntownship. In a two-wheeled buggy this was an exciting descent; but the\ncoach jammed on both its brakes, moved like a snail, and seemed hardly\nable to crawl.\n\nAt the foot of the hill the little town lay sluggish in the sun.\nAlthough it was close on midday, but few people were astir in the\nstreets; for the place had long since ceased to be an important mining\ncentre: the chief claims were worked out; and the coming of the railway\nhad been powerless to give it the impetus to a new life. It was always\nlike this in these streets of low, verandahed, red-brick houses, always\ndull and sleepy, and such animation as there was, was invariably to be\nfound before the doors of the many public-houses.\n\nAt one of these the coach stopped and unloaded its goods, for an\ninterminable time. People came and looked in at the window at Laura,\nand she was beginning to feel alarmed lest O'Donnell, who had gone\ninside, had forgotten all about her having to catch the train, when out\nhe came, wiping his lips.\n\n\"Now for the livin' luggage!\" he said with a wink, and Laura drew back\nin confusion from the laughter of a group of larrikins round the door.\n\nIt was indeed high time at the station; no sooner was her box dislodged\nand her ticket taken than the train steamed in. O'Donnell recommended\nher to the guard's care; she shook hands with him and thanked him, and\nhad just been locked into a carriage by herself when he came running\ndown the platform again, holding in his hand, for everyone to see, the\napple, which Laura believed she had safely hidden under the cushions of\nthe coach. Red to the roots of her hair she had to receive it before a\nnumber of heads put out to see what the matter was, and she was even\nforced to thank O'Donnell into the bargain. Then the guard came along\nonce more, and told her he would let no one get in beside her: she need\nnot be afraid.\n\n\"Yes. And will you please tell me when we come to Melbourne.\"\n\nDirectly the train was clear of the station, she lowered a window and,\ntaking aim at a telegraph post, threw the apple from her with all her\nmight. Then she hung out of the window, as far out as she could, till\nher hat was nearly carried off. This was the first railway journey she\nhad made by herself, and there was an intoxicating sense of freedom in\nbeing locked in, alone, within the narrow compass of the compartment.\nShe was at liberty to do everything that had previously been forbidden\nher: she walked up and down the carriage, jumped from one seat to\nanother, then lay flat on her back singing to herself, and watching the\ntelegraph poles fly past the windows, and the wires mount and\ndescend.--But now came a station and, though the train did not stop,\nshe sat up, in order that people might see she was travelling alone.\n\nShe grew hungry and attacked her lunch, and it turned out that Mother\nhad not provided too much after all. When she had finished, had brushed\nherself clean of crumbs and handled, till her finger-tips were sore,\nthe pompous half-crown she had found in her pocket, she fell to\nthinking of them at home, and of what they would now be doing. It was\nbetween two and three o'clock: the sun would be full on the flagstones\nof the back verandah; inch by inch Pin and Leppie would be driven away\nto find a cooler spot for their afternoon game, while little Frank\nslept, and Sarah splashed the dinner-dishes in the brick-floored\nkitchen. Mother sat sewing, and she would still be sitting there, still\nsewing, when the shadow of the fir tree, which at noon was shrunken\nlike a dwarf, had stretched to giant size, and the children had opened\nthe front gate to play in the shade of the public footpath.--At the\nthought of these shadows, of all the familiar things she would not see\nagain for months to come, Laura's eyelids began to smart.\n\nThey had flashed through several stations; now they stopped; and her\nmind was diverted by the noise and bustle. As the train swung into\nmotion again, she fell into a pleasanter line of thought. She painted\nto herself, for the hundredth time, the new life towards which she was\njourneying, and, as always, in the brightest colours.\n\nShe had arrived at school, and in a spacious apartment, which was a\nkind of glorified Mother's drawing-room, was being introduced to a bevy\nof girls. They clustered round, urgent to make the acquaintance of the\nnewcomer, who gave her hand to each with an easy grace and an\nappropriate word. They were too well-bred to cast a glance at her\nclothes, which, however she might embellish them in fancy, Laura knew\nwere not what they ought to be: her ulster was some years old, and so\nshort that it did not cover the flounce of her dress, and this dress,\nand her hat with it, were Mother's taste, and consequently, Laura felt\nsure, nobody else's. But her new companions saw that she wore these\nclothes with an elegance that made up for their shortcomings; and she\nheard them whisper: \"Isn't she pretty? What black eyes! What lovely\ncurls!\" But she was not proud, and by her ladylike manners soon made\nthem feel at home with her, even though they stood agape at her\ncleverness: none of THEM could claim to have absorbed the knowledge of\na whole house. With one of her admirers she had soon formed a\nfriendship that was the wonder of all who saw it: in deep respect the\nothers drew back, forming a kind of allee, down which, with linked\narms, the two friends sauntered, blind to everything but\nthemselves.--And having embarked thus upon her sea of dreams, Laura set\nsail and was speedily borne away.\n\n\"Next station you'll be there, little girl.\"\n\nShe sprang up and looked about her, with vacant eyes. This had been the\nlast stoppage, and the train was passing through the flats. In less\nthan two minutes she had collected her belongings, tidied her hair and\nput on her gloves.\n\nSome time afterwards they steamed in alongside a gravelled platform,\namong the stones of which a few grass-blades grew. This was Melbourne.\nAt the nearer end of the platform stood two ladies, one stout and\nelderly in bonnet and mantle, with glasses mounted on a black stick,\nand shortsighted, peering eyes; the other stout and comely, too, but\nyoung, with a fat, laughing face and rosy cheeks. Laura descried them a\nlong way off; and, as the carriage swept past them, they also saw her,\neager and prominent at her window. Both stared at her, and the younger\nlady said something, and laughed. Laura instantly connected the remark,\nand the amusement it caused the speaker, with the showy red lining of\nher hat, at which she believed their eyes had been directed. She also\nrealised, when it was too late, that her greeting had been childish,\nunnecessarily effusive; for the ladies had responded only by nods. Here\nwere two thrusts to parry at once, and Laura's cheeks tingled. But she\ndid not cease to smile, and she was still wearing this weak little\nsmile, which did its best to seem easy and unconcerned, when she\nalighted from the train.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\n\nThe elderly lady was Laura's godmother; she lived at Prahran, and it\nwas at her house that Laura would sometimes spend a monthly holiday.\nGodmother was good to them all in a brusque, sharp-tongued fashion; but\nPin was her especial favourite and she made no secret of it. Her\ncompanion on the platform was a cousin of Laura's, of at least twice\nLaura's age, who invariably struck awe into the children by her loud\nand ironic manner of speech. She was an independent, manly person, in\nspite of her plump roundnesses; she lived by herself in lodgings, and\nearned her own living as a clerk in an office.\n\nThe first greetings over, Godmother's attention was entirely taken up\nby Laura's box: after this had been picked out from among the other\nluggage, grave doubts were expressed whether it could be got on to the\nback seat of the pony-carriage, to which it was conveyed by a porter\nand the boy. Laura stood shyly by and waited, while Cousin Grace kept\nup the conversation by putting abrupt and embarrassing questions.\n\n\"How's your ma?\" she demanded rather than asked, in the slangy and\njocular tone she employed. \"I guess she'll be thanking her stars she's\ngot rid of you;\" at which Laura smiled uncertainly, not being sure\nwhether Cousin Grace spoke in jest or earnest.\n\n\"I suppose you think no end of yourself going to boarding-school?\"\ncontinued the latter.\n\n\"Oh no, not at all,\" protested Laura with due modesty; and as both at\nquestion and answer Cousin Grace laughed boisterously, Laura was glad\nto hear Godmother calling: \"Come, jump in. The ponies won't stand.\"\n\nGodmother was driving herself--a low basket-carriage, harnessed to two\nbuff-coloured ponies. Laura sat with her back to them. Godmother\nflapped the reins and said: \"Get up!\" but she was still fretted about\nthe box, which was being held on behind by the boy. An inch larger, she\nasserted, and it would have had to be left behind. Laura eyed its\nbattered sides uneasily. Godmother might remember, she thought, that it\ncontained her whole wardrobe; and she wondered how many of Godmother's\nown ample gowns could be compressed into so small a space.\n\n\"All my clothes are inside,\" she explained; \"that I shall need for\nmonths.\"\n\n\"Ah, I expect your poor mother has sat up sewing herself to death, that\nyou may be as well dressed as the rest of them,\" said Godmother, and\nheaved a doleful sigh. But Cousin Grace laughed the wide laugh that\ndisplayed a mouthful of great healthy teeth.\n\n\"What? All your clothes in there?\" she cried. \"I say! You couldn't be a\nqueen if you hadn't more togs than that.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know,\" Laura hastened to reply, and grew very red. \"Queens need\na lot more clothes than I've got.\"\n\n\"Tut, tut!\" said Godmother: she did not understand the allusion, which\nreferred to a former ambition of Laura's. \"Don't talk such nonsense to\nthe child.\"\n\nShe drove very badly, and they went by quiet by-streets to escape the\nmain traffic: the pony-chaise wobbled at random from one side of the\nroad to the other, obstacles looming up only just in time for Godmother\nto see them. The ponies shook and tossed their heads at the constant\nsawing of the bits, and Laura had to be continually ducking, to keep\nout of the way of the reins. She let the unfamiliar streets go past her\nin a kind of dream; and there was silence for a time, broken only by\nGodmother's expostulations with the ponies, till Cousin Grace, growing\ntired of playing her bright eyes first on this, then on that, brought\nthem back to Laura and studied her up and down.\n\n\"I say, who on earth trimmed your hat?\" she asked almost at once.\n\n\"Mother,\" answered Laura bravely, while the colour mounted to her\ncheeks again.\n\n\"Well, I guess she made up her mind you shouldn't get lost as long as\nyou wore it,\" went on her cousin with disconcerting candour. \"It makes\nyou look just like a great big red double dahlia.\"\n\n\"Let the child be. She looks well enough,\" threw in Godmother in her\nsnappish way. But Laura was sure that she, too disapproved; and felt\nmore than she heard the muttered remark about \"Jane always having had a\ntaste for something gay.\"\n\n\"Oh, I like the colour very much. I chose it myself,\" said Laura, and\nlooked straight at the two faces before her. But her lips twitched. She\nwould have liked to snatch the hat from her head, to throw it in front\nof the ponies and hear them trample it under their hoofs. She had never\nwanted the scarlet lining of the big, upturned brim; in a dislike to\nbeing conspicuous which was incomprehensible to Mother, she had\nimplored the latter to \"leave it plain\". But Mother had said:\n\"Nonsense!\" and \"Hold your tongue!\" and \"I know better,\"--with this\nresult.\n\nOh yes, she saw well enough how Godmother signed with her eyes to\nCousin Grace to say no more; but she pretended not to notice, and for\nthe remainder of the drive nobody spoke. They went past long lines of\ngrey houses, joined one to another and built exactly alike; past large,\nfenced-in public parks where all kinds of odd, unfamiliar trees grew,\nwith branches that ran right down their trunks, and bushy leaves. The\nbroad streets were hilly; the wind, coming in puffs, met them with\nclouds of gritty white dust. They had just, with bent heads, their\nhands at their hats, passed through one of these miniature whirlwinds,\nwhen turning a corner they suddenly drew up, and the boy sprang to the\nponies' heads. Laura, who had not been expecting the end so soon, saw\nonly a tall wooden fence; but Cousin Grace looked higher, gave a stagey\nshudder and cried: \"Oh my eye Betty Martin! Aren't I glad it isn't me\nthat's going to school! It looks just like a prison.\"\n\nIt certainly was an imposing building viewed from within, when the\npaling-gate had closed behind them. To Laura, who came from a township\nof one-storied brick or weatherboard houses, it seemed vast in its\nbreadth and height, appalling in its sombre greyness. Between Godmother\nand Cousin Grace she walked up an asphalted path, and mounted the steps\nthat led to a massive stone portico. The bell Godmother rang made no\nanswering sound, but after a very few seconds the door swung back, and\na slender maidservant in cap and apron stood before them. She smiled at\nthem pleasantly, as, in Chinaman-fashion, they crossed the threshold;\nthen, inclining her head at a murmured word from Godmother, she\nvanished as lightly as she had come, and they sat and looked about\nthem. They were in a plainly furnished but very lofty waiting-room.\nThere were two large windows. The venetian blinds had not been lowered,\nand the afternoon sun, beating in, displayed a shabby patch on the\ncarpet. It showed up, too, a coating of dust that had gathered on the\ndesk-like, central table. There was the faint, distinctive smell of\nstrange furniture. But what impressed Laura most was the stillness. No\nstreet noises pierced the massy walls, but neither did the faintest\necho of all that might be taking place in the great building itself\nreach their ears: they sat aloof, shut off, as it were, from the living\nworld. And this feeling soon grew downright oppressive: it must be like\nthis to be dead, thought Laura to herself; and inconsequently\nremembered a quarter of an hour she had once spent in a dentist's\nante-room: there as here the same soundless vacancy, the same anguished\nexpectancy. Now, as then, her heart began to thump so furiously that\nshe was afraid the others would hear it. But they, too, were subdued;\nthough Cousin Grace tittered continually you heard only a gentle\nwheezing, and even Godmother expressed the hope that they would not be\nkept waiting long, under her breath. But minute after minute went by;\nthere they sat and nothing happened. It began to seem as if they might\nsit on for ever.\n\nAll of a sudden, from out the spacious halls of which they had caught a\nglimpse on arriving, brisk steps began to come towards them over the\noilcloth--at first as a mere tapping in the distance, then rapidly\ngaining in weight and decision. Laura's palpitations reached their\nextreme limit--another second and they might have burst her chest.\nCousin Grace ceased to giggle; the door opened with a peculiar\nflourish; and all three rose to their feet.\n\nThe person who entered was a very stately lady; she wore a cap with\nblack ribbons. With the door-handle still in her hand she made a slight\nobeisance, in which her whole body joined, afterwards to become more\nerect than before. Having introduced herself to Godmother as Mrs.\nGurley, the Lady Superintendent of the institution, she drew up a\nchair, let herself down upon it, and began to converse with an air of\nineffable condescension.\n\nWhile she talked Laura examined her, with a child's thirst for detail.\nMrs. Gurley was large and generous of form, and she carried her head in\nsuch a haughty fashion that it made her look taller than she really\nwas. She had a high colour, her black hair was touched with grey, her\nupper teeth were prominent. She wore gold eyeglasses, many rings, a\nlong gold chain, which hung from an immense cameo brooch at her throat,\nand a black apron with white flowers on it, one point of which was\npinned to her ample bosom. The fact that Laura had just such an apron\nin her box went only a very little way towards reviving her spirits;\nfor altogether Mrs. Gurley was the most impressive person she had ever\nset eyes on. Beside her, God mother was nothing but a plump,\nshortsighted fidgety lady.\n\nParticularly awe-inspiring was Mrs. Gurley when she listened to another\nspeaking. She held her head a little to one side, her teeth met her\nunderlip and her be-ringed hands toyed incessantly with the long gold\nchain, in a manner which seemed to denote that she set little value on\nwhat was being said. Awful, too, was the habit she had of suddenly\nlowering her head and looking at you over the tops of her glasses: when\nshe did this, and when her teeth came down on her lip, you would have\nliked to shrink to the size of a mouse. Godmother, it was true, was not\nafraid of her; but Cousin Grace was hushed at last and as for Laura\nherself, she consciously wore a fixed little simper, which was meant to\nput it beyond doubt that butter would not melt in her mouth.\n\nGodmother now asked if she might say a few words in private, and the\ntwo ladies left the room. As the door closed behind them Cousin Grace\nbegan to be audible again.\n\n\"Oh, snakes!\" she giggled, and her double chin spread itself \"There's a\nTartar for you! Don't I thank my stars it's not me that's being shunted\noff here! She'll give you what-for.\"\n\n\"I don't think so. I think she's very nice,\" said Laura staunchly, out\nof an instinct that made her chary of showing fear, or pain, or grief.\nBut her heart began to bound again, for the moment in which she would\nbe left alone.\n\n\"You see!\" said Cousin Grace. \"It'll be bread and water for a week, if\nyou can't do AMARE first go-off--not to mention the deponents.\"\n\n\"What's AMARE?\" asked Laura anxiously, and her eyes grew so big that\nthey seemed to fill her face.\n\nBut Cousin Grace only laughed till it seemed probable that she would\nburst her bodice; and Laura blushed, aware that she had compromised\nherself anew.\n\nThere followed a long and nervous pause.\n\n\"I bet Godmother's asking her not to wallop you too often,\" the tease\nhad just begun afresh, when the opening of the door forced her to\nswallow her sentence in the middle.\n\nGodmother would not sit down; so the dreaded moment had come.\n\n\"Now, Laura. Be a good girl and learn well, and be a comfort to your\nmother.--Not that there's much need to urge her to her books,\"\nGodmother interrupted herself, turning to Mrs. Gurley. \"The trouble her\ndear mother has always had has been to keep her from them.\"\n\nLaura glowed with pleasure. Now at least the awful personage would know\nthat she was clever, and loved to learn. But Mrs. Gurley smiled the\nchilliest thinkable smile of acknowledgment, and did not reply a word.\n\nShe escorted the other to the front door, and held it open for them to\npass out. Then, however, her pretence of affability faded clean away:\nturning her head just so far that she could look down her nose at her\nown shoulder, she said: \"Follow me!\"--in a tone Mother would not have\nused even to Sarah. Feeling inexpressibly small Laura was about to\nobey, when a painful thought struck her.\n\n\"Oh please, I had a box--with my clothes in it!\" she cried. \"Oh, I hope\nthey haven't forgotten and taken it away again.\"\n\nBut she might as well have spoken to the hatstand: Mrs. Gurley had\nsailed off, and was actually approaching a turn in the hall before\nLaura made haste to follow her and to keep further anxiety about her\nbox to herself. They went past one staircase, round a bend into shadows\nas black as if, outside, no sun were shining, and began to ascend\nanother flight of stairs, which was the widest Laura had ever seen. The\nbanisters were as thick as your arm, and on each side of the\nstair-carpeting the space was broad enough for two to walk abreast:\nwhat a splendid game of trains you could have played there! On the\nother hand the landing windows were so high up that only a giant could\nhave seen out of them.\n\nThese things occurred to Laura mechanically. What really occupied her,\nas she trudged behind, was how she could please this hard-faced woman\nand make her like her, for the desire to please, to be liked by all the\nworld, was the strongest her young soul knew. And there must be a way,\nfor Godmother had found it without difficulty.\n\nShe took two steps at once, to get nearer to the portly back in front\nof her.\n\n\"What a VERY large place this is!\" she said in an insinuating voice.\n\nShe hoped the admiration, thus subtly expressed in the form of\nsurprise, would flatter Mrs. Gurley, as a kind of co-proprietor; but it\nwas evident that it did nothing of the sort: the latter seemed to have\ngone deaf and dumb, and marched on up the stairs, her hands clasped at\nher waist, her eyes fixed ahead, like a walking stone-statue.\n\nOn the top floor she led the way to a room at the end of a long\npassage. There were four beds in this room, a washhand-stand, a chest\nof drawers, and a wall cupboard. But at first sight Laura had eyes only\nfor the familiar object that stood at the foot of one of the beds.\n\n\"Oh, THERE'S my box!\" she cried, \"Someone must have brought it up.\"\n\nIt was unroped; she had simply to hand over the key. Mrs. Gurley went\ndown on her knees before it, opened the lid, and began to pass the\ncontents to Laura, directing her where to lay and hang them. Overawed\nby such complaisance, Laura moved nimbly about the room shaking and\nunfolding, taking care to be back at the box to the minute so as not to\nkeep Mrs. Gurley waiting. And her promptness was rewarded; the stern\nface seemed to relax. At the mere hint of this, Laura grew warm through\nand through; and as she could neither control her feelings nor keep\nthem to herself, she rushed to an extreme and overshot the mark.\n\n\"I've got an apron like that. I think they're so pretty,\" she said\ncordially, pointing to the one Mrs. Gurley wore.\n\nThe latter abruptly stopped her work, and, resting her hands on the\nsides of the box, gave Laura one of the dreaded looks over her glasses,\nlooked at her from top to toe, and as though she were only now\nbeginning to see her. There was a pause, a momentary suspension of the\nbreath, which Laura soon learned to expect before a rebuke.\n\n\"Little gels,\" said Mrs. Gurley--and even in the midst of her confusion\nLaura could not but be struck by the pronunciation of this word.\n\"Little gels--are required--to wear white aprons when they come\nhere!\"--a break after each few words, as well as an emphatic\nhead-shake, accentuated their severity. \"And I should like to know, if\nyour mother, has never taught you, that it is very rude, to point, and\nalso to remark, on what people wear.\"\n\nLaura went scarlet: if there was one thing she, Mother all of them\nprided themselves on, it was the good manners that had been instilled\ninto them since their infancy.--The rough reproof seemed to scorch her.\n\nShe went to and fro more timidly than before. Then, however, something\nhappened which held a ray of hope.\n\n\"Why, what is this?\" asked Mrs. Gurley freezingly, and held up to\nview--with the tips of her fingers, Laura thought--a small, black\nPrayer Book. \"Pray, are you not a dissenter?\"--For the College was\nnonconformist.\n\n\"Well ... no, I'm not,\" said Laura, in a tone of intense apology. Here,\nat last, was her chance. \"But it really doesn't matter a bit. I can go\nto another church quite well. I even think I'd rather. For a change.\nAnd the service isn't so long, at least so I've heard--except the\nsermon,\" she added truthfully.\n\nHad she denied religion altogether, the look Mrs. Gurley bent on her\ncould not have been more annihilating.\n\n\"There is--unfortunately!--no occasion, for you to do anything of the\nkind,\" she retorted. \"I myself, am an Episcopalian, and I expect those\ngels, who belong to the Church of England, to attend it, with me.\"\n\nThe unpacking at an end, Mrs. Gurley rose, smoothed down her apron, and\nwas just on the point of turning away, when on the bed opposite Laura's\nshe espied an under-garment, lying wantonly across the counterpane. At\nthis blot on the orderliness of the room she seemed to swell like a\nturkey-cock, seemed literally to grow before Laura's eyes as, striding\nto the door, she commanded an invisible some one to send Lilith Gordon\nto her \"DI-rectly!\"!\n\nThere was an awful pause; Laura did not dare to raise her head; she\neven said a little prayer. Mrs. Gurley stood working at her chain, and\ntapping her foot--like a beast waiting for its prey, thought the child.\nAnd at last a hurried step was heard in the corridor, the door opened\nand a girl came in, high-coloured and scant of breath. Laura darted one\nglance at Mrs. Gurley's face, then looked away and studied the pattern\nof a quilt, trying not to hear what was said. Her throat swelled, grew\nhard and dry with pity for the culprit. But Lilith Gordon--a girl with\nsandy eyebrows, a turned-up nose, a thick plait of red-gold hair, and a\nfigure so fully developed that Laura mentally dubbed it a \"lady's\nfigure\", and put its owner down for years older than herself--Lilith\nGordon neither fell on her knees nor sank through the floor. Her lashes\nwere lowered, in a kind of dog-like submission, and her face had gone\nvery red when Laura ventured to look at her again; but that was all.\nAnd Mrs. Gurley having swept Jove-like from the room, this bold girl\nactually set her finger to her nose and muttered: \"Old Brimstone\nBeast!\" As she passed Laura, too, she put out her tongue and said: \"Now\nthen, goggle-eyes, what have you got to stare at?\"\n\nLaura was deeply hurt: she had gazed at Lilith out of the purest\nsympathy. And now, as she stood waiting for Mrs. Gurley, who seemed to\nhave forgotten her, the strangeness of things, and the general\nunfriendliness of the people struck home with full force. The late\nafternoon sun was shining in, in an unfamiliar way; outside were\nstrange streets, strange noises, a strange white dust, the expanse of a\nbig, strange city. She felt unspeakably far away now, from the small,\nsnug domain of home. Here, nobody wanted her ... she was alone among\nstrangers, who did not even like her ... she had already, without\nmeaning it, offended two of them.\n\nAnother second, and the shameful tears might have found their way out.\nBut at this moment there was a kind of preparatory boom in the\ndistance, and the next, a great bell clanged through the house, pealing\non and on, long after one's ears were rasped by the din. It was\nfollowed by an exodus from the rooms round about; there was a sound of\nvoices and of feet. Mrs. Gurley ceased to give orders in the passage,\nand returning, bade Laura put on a pinafore and follow her.\n\nThey descended the broad staircase. At a door just at the foot, Mrs.\nGurley paused and smoothed her already faultless bands of hair; then\nturned the handle and opened the door, with the majestic swing Laura\nhad that day once before observed.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\n\nFifty-five heads turned as if by clockwork, and fifty-five pairs of\neyes were levelled at the small girl in the white apron who meekly\nfollowed Mrs. Gurley down the length of the dining-room. Laura\ncrimsoned under the unexpected ordeal, and tried to fix her attention\non the flouncing of Mrs. Gurley's dress. The room seemed hundreds of\nfeet long, and not a single person at the tea-tables but took stock of\nher. The girls made no scruple of leaning backwards and forwards,\nbehind and before their neighbours, in order to see her better, and\neven the governesses were not above having a look. All were standing.\nOn Mrs. Gurley assigning Laura a place at her own right hand, Laura\ncovered herself with confusion by taking her seat at once, before grace\nhad been said, and before the fifty-five had drawn in their chairs with\nthe noise of a cavalry brigade on charge. She stood up again\nimmediately, but it was too late; an audible titter whizzed round the\ntable: the new girl had sat down. For minutes after, Laura was lost in\nthe pattern on her plate; and not till tongues were loosened and dishes\nbeing passed, did she venture to steal a glance round.\n\nThere were four tables, with a governess at the head and foot of each\nto pour out tea. It was more of a hall than a room and had high,\nchurch-like windows down one side. At both ends were scores of\npigeon-holes. There was a piano in it and a fireplace; it had [P.45]\npale blue walls, and only strips of carpet on the floor. At present it\nwas darkish, for the windows did not catch the sun.\n\nLaura was roused by a voice at her side; turning, she found her\nneighbour offering her a plate of bread.\n\n\"No, thank you,\" she said impulsively; for the bread was cut in chunks,\nand did not look inviting.\n\nBut the girl nudged her on the sly. \"You'd better take some,\" she\nwhispered.\n\nLaura then saw that there was nothing else. But she saw, too, the\nsmiles and signs that again flew round: the new girl had said no.\n\nHumbly she accepted the butter and the cup of tea which were passed to\nher in turn, and as humbly ate the piece of rather stale bread. She\nfelt forlornly miserable under the fire of all these unkind eyes, which\ntook a delight in marking her slips: at the smallest further mischance\nshe might disgrace herself by bursting out crying. Just at this moment,\nhowever, something impelled her to look up. Her vis-a-vis, whom she had\nas yet scarcely noticed, was staring hard. And now, to her great\nsurprise, this girl winked at her, winked slowly and deliberately with\nthe right eye. Laura was so discomposed that she looked away again at\nonce, and some seconds elapsed before she was brave enough to take\nanother peep. The wink was repeated.\n\nIt was a black-haired girl this time, a girl with small blue eyes, a\npale, freckled skin, and large white teeth. What most impressed Laura,\nthough, was her extraordinary gravity: she chewed away with a face as\nsolemn as a parson's; and then just when you were least expecting it,\ncame the wink. Laura was fascinated: she lay in wait for it beforehand\nand was doubtful whether to feel offended by it or to laugh at it. But\nat least it made her forget her mishaps, and did away with the\ntemptation to cry.\n\nWhen, however, Mrs. Gurley had given the signal, and the fifty-five had\npushed back their chairs and set them to the table again with the same\nracket as before, Laura's position was a painful one. Everybody pushed,\nand talked, and laughed, in a hurry to leave the hall, and no one took\nany notice of her except to stare. After some indecision, she followed\nthe rest through a door. Here she found herself on a verandah facing\nthe grounds of the school. There was a long bench, on which several\npeople were sitting: she took a modest seat at one end. Two of the\nyounger governesses looked at her and laughed, and made a remark. She\nsaw her room-mate, Lilith Gordon, arm in arm with a couple of\ncompanions. The winker of the tea-table turned out to be a girl of her\nown age, but of a broader make; she had fat legs, which were encased in\nthickly-ribbed black stockings. As she passed the bench she left the\nfriend she was with, to come up to Laura and dig her in the ribs.\n\n\"DIDN'T she like her bread and butter, poor little thing?\" she said.\nLaura shrank from the dig, which was rough; but she could not help\nsmiling shyly at the girl, who looked good-natured. If only she had\nstayed and talked to her! But she was off and away, her arm round a\ncomrade's neck.\n\nBesides herself, there was now only an elderly governess left, who was\nreading. She, Laura, in her solitude, was conspicuous to every eye. But\nat this juncture up came two rather rollicking older girls, one of whom\nwas fair, with a red complexion. AS soon as their loud voices had\ndriven the governess away, the smaller of the two, who had a pronounced\nsquint, turned to Laura.\n\n\"Hullo, you kid,\" she said, \"what's YOUR name?\"\n\nLaura artlessly replied. She was dumbfounded by the storm of merriment\nthat followed. Maria Morell, the fat girl, went purple, and had to be\nthumped on the back by her friend.\n\n\"Oh, my!\" she gasped, when she had got her breath. \"Oh, my ... hold me,\nsome one, or I shall split! Oh, golly! Laura ... Tweedle ...\nRambotham--Laura ... Tweedle ... Rambotham! ...\" her voice tailed off\nagain. \"Gosh! Was there ever such a name?\"\n\nShe laughed till she could laugh no more, rocking backwards and\nforwards and from side to side; while her companion proceeded to make\nfurther inquiries.\n\n\"Where do you come from?\" the squint demanded of Laura, in a\nbusiness-like way.\n\nLaura named the township, quaveringly. \"What's your father?\"\n\n\"He's dead,\" answered the child.\n\n\"Well, but I suppose he was alive once wasn't he, duffer? What was he\nbefore he was dead?\"\n\n\"A barrister.\"\n\n\"What did he die of?\"\n\n\"Consumption.\"\n\n\"How many servants do you keep?\"\n\n\"One.\"\n\n\"How much have you got a year?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"How old are you?\"\n\n\"Twelve and a quarter.\"\n\n\"Who made your dress?\"\n\n\"Mother.\"\n\n\"Oh, I say, hang it, that's enough. Stop teasing the kid,\" said Maria\nMorell, when the laughter caused by the last admission had died away.\nBut the squint spied a friend, ran to her, and there was a great deal\nof whispering and sniggering. Presently the pair came sauntering up and\nsat down; and after some artificial humming and hawing the newcomer\nbegan to talk, in a loud and fussy manner, about certain acquaintances\nof hers called Tweedledum and Tweedledee. Both the fat girl and the\nsquint \"split\" with laughter. Laura sat with her hands locked one\ninside the other; there was no escape for her, for she did not know\nwhere to go. But when the third girl put the regulation question:\n\"What's your name and what's your father?\" she turned on her, with the\ncourage of despair.\n\n\"What's yours?\" she retorted hotly, at the same time not at all sure\nhow the big girl might revenge herself. To her relief, the others burst\nout laughing at their friend's bafflement.\n\n\"That's one for you, Kate Horner,\" said Maria with a chuckle. \"Not bad\nfor the kid.--Come on, Kid, will you have a walk round the garden?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, PLEASE,\" said Laura, reddening with pleasure; and there she\nwas, arm in arm with her fat saviour, promenading the grounds like any\nother of the fifty-five.\n\nShe assumed, as well as she could, an air of feeling at her ease even\nin the presence of the cold and curious looks that met her. The fat\ngirl was protective, and Laura felt too grateful to her to take it\namiss that every now and then she threw back her head and laughed anew,\nat the remembrance of Laura's patronymics; or that she still exchanged\njokes about them with the other couple, when they met.\n\nBut by this time half an hour had slipped away, and the girls were fast\ndisappearing. Maria Morell loitered till the last minute, then said,\nshe, too, must be off to 'stew'. Every one was hastening across the\nverandah laden with books, and disappearing down a corridor. Left\nalone, Laura made her way back to the dining-hall. Here some of the\nvery young boarders were preparing their lessons, watched over by a\njunior governess. Laura lingered for a little, to see if no order were\nforthcoming, then diffidently approached the table and asked the\ngoverness if she would please tell her what to do.\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know,\" answered that lady, disinclined for\nresponsibility. \"You'd better ask Miss Chapman. Here, Maggie, show her\nwhere the study is.\"\n\nLaura followed the little girl over the verandah and down the corridor.\nAt the end, the child pointed to a door, and on opening this Laura\nfound herself in a very large brightly lighted room, where the boarders\nsat at two long tables with their books before them. Every head was\nraised at her entrance. In great embarrassment, she threaded her way to\nthe more authoritative-looking of the governesses in charge, and\nproffered her request. It was not understood, and she had to repeat it.\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know,\" said Miss Day in her turn: she had stiff,\nblack, wavy hair, a vivid colour, and a big, thick nose which made her\nprofile resemble that of a horse. \"Can't you twiddle your thumbs for a\nbit?--Oh well, if you're so desperately anxious for an occupation,\nyou'd better ask Miss Chapman.\"\n\nThe girls in the immediate neighbourhood laughed noiselessly, in a\nbounden-duty kind of way, at their superior's pleasantry, and Laura,\nfeeling as though she had been hit, crossed to the other table. Miss\nChapman, the head governess, was neither so hard-looking nor so\nbrilliant as Miss Day. She even eyed Laura somewhat uneasily, meanwhile\ntoying with a long gold chain, after the manner of the Lady\nSuperintendent.\n\n\"Didn't Mrs. Gurley tell you what to do?\" she queried. \"I should think\nit likely she would. Oh well, if she didn't, I suppose you'd better\nbring your things downstairs. Yes ... and ask Miss Zielinski to give\nyou a shelf.\"\n\nMiss Zielinski--she was the governess in the dining-hall--said: \"Oh,\nvery well,\" in the rather whiny voice that seemed natural to her, and\nwent on reading.\n\n\"Please, I don't think I know my way,\" ventured Laura.\n\n\"Follow your nose and you'll find it!\" said Miss Zielinski without\nlooking up, and was forthwith wrapt in her novel again.\n\nOnce more Laura climbed the wide staircase: it was but dimly lighted,\nand the passages were in darkness. After a few false moves she found\nher room, saw that her box had been taken away, her books left lying\n[P.51] on a chair. But instead of picking them up, she threw herself on\nher bed and buried her face in the pillow. She did not dare to cry, for\nfear of making her eyes red, but she hugged the cool linen to her\ncheeks.\n\n\"I hate them all,\" she said passionately, speaking aloud to herself.\n\"Oh, HOW I hate them!\"--and wild schemes of vengeance flashed through\nher young mind. She did not even halt at poison or the knife: a big\ncake, sent by Mother, of which she invited all alike to partake, and\ninto which she inserted a fatal poison, so that the whole school died\nlike rabbits; or a nightly stabbing, a creeping from bed to bed in the\ndark, her penknife open in her hand...\n\nBut she had not lain thus for more than a very few minutes when steps\ncame along the passage; and she had only just time to spring to her\nfeet before one of the little girls appeared at the door.\n\n\"You're to come down at once.\"\n\n\"Don't you know you're not ALLOWED to stay upstairs?\" asked Miss\nZielinski crossly. \"What were you doing?\" And as Laura did not reply:\n\"What was she doing, Jessie?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said the child. \"She was just standing there.\" And all\nthe little girls laughed, after the manner of their elders.\n\nBefore Laura had finished arranging her belongings on the shelves that\nwere assigned to her, some of the older girls began to drop in from the\nstudy. One unceremoniously turned over her books, which were lying on\nthe table.\n\n\"Let's see what the kid's got.\"\n\nNow Laura was proud of her collection: it really made a great show; for\na daughter of Godmother's had once attended the College, and her\nequipment had been handed down to Laura.\n\n\"Why, you don't mean to say a kid like you's in the Second Principia\nalready?\" said a big girl, and held up, incredulously, Smith's black\nand red boards. \"Wherever did YOU learn Latin?\"\n\nIn the reediest of voices Laura was forced to confess that she had\nnever learnt Latin at all.\n\nThe girl eyed her in dubious amaze, then burst out laughing. \"Oh, I\nsay!\" she called to a friend. \"Here's a rum go. Here's this kid brings\nthe Second Principia with her and doesn't know the First.\"\n\nSeveral others crowded round; and all found this divergence from the\nnorm, from the traditional method of purchasing each book new and as it\nwas needed, highly ridiculous. Laura, on her knees before her shelf,\npretended to be busy; but she could not see what she was doing, for the\nmist that gathered in her eyes.\n\nJust at this moment, however, in marched Maria Morell. \"Here, I say,\nstop that!\" she cried. \"You're teasing that kid again. I won't have it.\nHere, come on, Kid--Laura Tweedledum come and sit by me for supper.\"\n\nFor the second time, Laura was thankful to the fat girl. But as\nill-luck would have it, Miss Chapman chanced to let her eyes stray in\ntheir direction; and having fingered her chain indecisively for a\nlittle, said: \"It seems a pity, doesn't it, Miss Day, that that nice\nlittle girl should get in with that vulgar set?\"\n\nMiss Chapman liked to have her opinions confirmed. But this was a\nweakness Miss Day did not pamper; herself strong-minded, she could\nafford to disregard Miss Chapman's foibles. So she went on with her\nbook, and ignored the question. But Miss Zielinski, who lost no\nopportunity of making herself agreeable to those over her, said with\nforeign emphasis: \"Yes, indeed it does.\"\n\nSo Laura was summoned and made to sit down at the end of the room,\nclose to the governesses and beside the very big girls--girls of\neighteen and nineteen, who seemed older still to her, with their\nfigures, and waists, and skirts that touched the ground.\n\nInstinctively she felt that they resented her proximity. The biggest of\nall, a pleasant-faced girl with a kind smile, said on seeing her\ndowncast air: \"Poor little thing! Never mind.\" But when they talked\namong themselves they lowered their voices and cast stealthy glances at\nher, to see if she were listening.\n\nSupper over, three chairs were set out in an exposed position; the big\nbell in the passage was lightly touched; everyone fetched a hymn-book,\none with music in it being handed to Miss Chapman at the piano. The\ndoor opened to admit first Mrs. Gurley, then the Principal and his\nwife--a tall, fair gentleman in a long coat, and a sweet-faced lady,\nwho wore a rose in her velvet dress.\n\n\"Let us sing in the hundred and fifty-seventh hymn,\" said the\ngentleman, who had a Grecian profile and a drooping, sandy moustache;\nand when Miss Chapman had played through the tune, the fifty-five, the\ngovernesses, the lady and gentleman rose to their feet and sang, with\nhalting emphasis, of the Redeemer and His mercy, to Miss Chapman's\naccompaniment, which was as indecisive as her manner, the left hand\ndragging lamely along after the right.\n\n\"Let us read in the third chapter of the Second Epistle of Paul to the\nThessalonians.\"\n\nEveryone laid her hymn-book on the table and sat down to listen to\nPaul's words, which the sandy gentleman read to a continual nervous\nmovement of the left leg.\n\n\"Let us pray.\"\n\nObeying the word, the fifty-five rose, faced about, and knelt to their\nchairs. It was an extempore prayer, and a long one, and Laura did not\nhear much of it; for the two big girls on her right kept up throughout\na running conversation. Also, when it was about half over she was\nstartled to hear Miss Zielinski say, in a shrill whisper: \"Heavens!\nThere's that mouse again,\" and audibly draw her skirts round her. Even\nMiss Chapman, praying to her piano-chair some distance off, had heard,\nand turned her head to frown rebuke.\n\nThe prayer at an end, Mr. and Mrs. Strachey bowed vaguely in several\ndirections, shook hands with the governesses, and left the room. This\nwas the signal for two of the teachers to advance with open Bibles.\n\n\"Here, little one, have you learned your verse?\" whispered Laura's\npleasant neighbour.\n\nLaura knew nothing of it; but the big girl lent her a Bible, and, since\nit was not a hard verse and every girl repeated it, it was quickly\nlearned.\n\nI WISDOM DWELL WITH PRUDENCE AND FIND OUT KNOWLEDGE OF WITTY INVENTIONS.\n\nTold off in batches, they filed up the stairs. On the first landing\nstood Miss Day, watching with lynx-eyes to see that no books or\neatables were smuggled to the bedrooms. In a strident voice she\nexhorted the noisy to silence, and the loiterers to haste.\n\nLaura sped to her room. She was fortunate enough to find it still\nempty. Tossing off her clothes, she gabbled ardently through her own\nprayers, drew the blankets up over her head, and pretended to be\nasleep. Soon the lights were out and all was quiet. Then, with her face\nburrowed deep, so that not a sound could escape, she gave free play to\nher tears.\n\n\n\n\nVI.\n\n\nMY DEAR MOTHER\n\nI SENT YOU A POSTCARD DID YOU GET IT.

PINS SPELLING\nWAS DREADFULL AND SHE IS NEARLY NINE NOW AND IS SUCH A BABY THE GIRLS\nWOULD LAUGH AT HER.\n\nI REMAIN\n\nYOUR AFECTIONATE DAUGHTER LAURA.\n\nP.S. I PARSSED A LONG SENTENCE WITHOUT ANY MISTAKES.\n\n\n\n\nVII.\n\n\nThe mornings were beginning to grow dark and chilly: fires were laid\novernight in the outer classrooms--and the junior governess who was on\nearly duty, having pealed the six-o'clock bell, flitted like a grey\nwraith from room to room and from one gas-jet to another, among\nstretched, sleeping forms. And the few minutes' grace at an end, it was\na cold, unwilling pack that threw off coverlets and jumped out of bed,\nto tie on petticoats and snuggle into dressing-gowns and shawls; for\nthe first approach of cooler weather was keenly felt, after the summer\nheat. The governess blew on speedily chilblained fingers, in making her\nrounds of the verandahs to see that each of the twenty pianos was\nrightly occupied; and, as winter crept on, its chief outward sign an\noccasional thin white spread of frost which vanished before the mighty\nsun of ten o'clock, she sometimes took the occupancy for granted, and\nskipped an exposed room.\n\nAt eight, the boarders assembled in the dining-hall for prayers and\nbreakfast. After this meal it was Mrs. Gurley's custom to drink a glass\nof hot water. While she sipped, she gave audience, meting out rebukes\nand crushing complaints--were any bold enough to offer them--standing\nerect behind her chair at the head of the table, supported by one or\nmore of the staff. To suit the season she was draped in a shawl of\ncrimson wool, which reached to the flounce of her skirt, and was borne\nby her portly shoulders with the grace of a past day. Beneath the\nshawl, her dresses were built, year in, year out, on the same plan: cut\nin one piece, buttoning right down the front, they fitted her like an\neelskin, rigidly outlining her majestic proportions, and always short\nenough to show a pair of surprisingly small, well-shod feet. Thus she\nstood, sipping her water, and boring with her hard, unflagging eye\nevery girl that presented herself to it. Most shrank noiselessly away\nas soon as breakfast was over; for, unless one was very firm indeed in\nthe conviction of one's own innocence, to be beneath this eye was apt\nto induce a disagreeable sense of guilt. In the case of Mrs. Gurley,\nfamiliarity had never been known to breed contempt. She was possessed\nof what was little short of genius, for ruling through fear; and no\nmore fitting overseer could have been set at the head of these\nhalf-hundred girls, of all ages and degrees: gentle and common; ruly\nand unruly, children hardly out of the nursery, and girls well over the\nbrink of womanhood, whose ripe, bursting forms told their own tale; the\ndaughters of poor ministers at reduced fees; and the spoilt heiresses\nof wealthy wool-brokers and squatters, whose dowries would mount to\nmany thousands of pounds.--Mrs. Gurley was equal to them all.\n\nIn a very short time, there was no more persistent shrinker from the\nice of this gaze than little Laura. In the presence of Mrs. Gurley the\nchild had a difficulty in getting her breath. Her first week of school\nlife had been one unbroken succession of snubs and reprimands. For\nthis, the undue familiarity of her manner was to blame: she was all too\nslow to grasp--being of an impulsive disposition and not naturally\nshy--that it was indecorous to accost Mrs. Gurley off-hand, to treat\nher, indeed, in any way as if she were an ordinary mortal. The climax\nhad come one morning--it still made Laura's cheeks burn to remember it.\nShe had not been able to master her French lesson for that day, and\nseeing Mrs. Gurley chatting to a governess had gone thoughtlessly up to\nher and tapped her on the arm.\n\n\"Mrs. Gurley, please, do you think it would matter very much if I only\ntook half this verb today? It's COUDRE, and means to sew, you know, and\nit's SO hard. I don't seem to be able to get it into my head.\"\n\nBefore the words were out of her mouth, she saw that she had made a\nterrible mistake. Mrs. Gurley's face, which had been smiling, froze to\nstone. She looked at her arm as though the hand had bitten her, and\nLaura's sudden shrinking did not move her, to whom seldom anyone\naddressed a word unbidden.\n\n\"How DARE you interrupt me--when I am speaking!\"--she hissed,\npunctuating her words with the ominous head-shakes and pauses. \"The\nfirst thing, miss, for you to do, will be, to take a course of lessons,\nin manners. Your present ones, may have done well enough, in the\nouthouse, to which you have evidently belonged. They will not do, here,\nin the company of your betters.\"\n\nAbove the child's head the two ladies smiled significantly at each\nother, assured that, after this, there would be no further want of\nrespect; but Laura did not see them. The iron of the thrust went deep\ndown into her soul: no one had ever yet cast a slur upon her home.\nRetreating to a lavatory she cried herself nearly sick, making her eyes\nso red that she was late for prayers in trying to wash them white.\nSince that day, she had never of her own free will approached Mrs.\nGurley again, and even avoided those places where she was likely to be\nfound. This was why one morning, some three weeks later, on discovering\nthat she had forgotten one of her lesson-books, she hesitated long\nbefore re-entering the dining-hall. The governesses still clustered\nround their chief, and the pupils were not expected to return. But it\nwas past nine o'clock; in a minute the public prayer-bell would ring,\nwhich united boarders, several hundred day-scholars, resident and\nvisiting teachers in the largest class-room; and Laura did not know her\nEnglish lesson. So she stole in, cautiously dodging behind the group,\nin a twitter lest the dreaded eyes should turn her way.\n\nIt was Miss Day who spied her and demanded an explanation.\n\n\"Such carelessness! You girls would forget your heads if they weren't\nscrewed on,\" retorted the governess, in the dry, violent manner that\nmade her universally disliked.\n\nThankful to escape with this, Laura picked out her book and hurried\nfrom the room.\n\nBut the thoughts of the group had been drawn to her.\n\n\"The greatest little oddity we've had here for some time,\" pronounced\nMiss Day, pouting her full bust in decisive fashion.\n\n\"She is, indeed,\" agreed Miss Zielinski.\n\n\"I don't know what sort of a place she comes from, I'm sure,\" continued\nthe former: \"but it must be the end of creation. She's utterly no idea\nof what's what, and as for her clothes they're fit for a Punch and Judy\nshow.\"\n\n\"She's had no training either--stupid, I call her,\" chimed in one of\nthe younger governesses, whose name was Miss Snodgrass. \"She doesn't\nknow the simplest things, and her spelling is awful. And yet, do you\nknow, at history the other day, she wanted to hold forth about how\nLondon looked in Elizabeth's reign--when she didn't know a single one\nof the dates!\"\n\n\"She can say some poetry,\" said Miss Zielinski. \"And she's read Scott.\"\n\nOne and all shook their heads at this, and Mrs. Gurley went on shaking\nhers and smiling grimly. \"Ah! the way gels are brought up nowadays,\"\nshe said. \"There was no such thing in my time. We were made to learn\nwhat would be of some use and help to us afterwards.\"\n\nElderly Miss Chapman twiddled her chain. \"I hope I did right Mrs.\nGurley. She had one week's early practice, but she looked so white all\nday after it that I haven't put her down for it again. I hope I did\nright?\"\n\n\"Oh, well, we don't want to have them ill, you know,\" replied Mrs.\nGurley, in the rather irresponsive tone she adopted towards Miss\nChapman. \"As long as it isn't mere laziness.\"\n\n\"I don't think she's lazy,\" said Miss Chapman. \"At least she takes\ngreat pains with her lessons at night.\"\n\nThis was true. Laura tried her utmost, with an industry born of\ndespair. For the comforting assurance of speedy promotion, which she\nhad given Mother, had no root in fact. These early weeks only served to\nreduce, bit by bit, her belief in her own knowledge. How slender this\nwas, and of how little use to her in her new state, she did not dare to\nconfess even to herself. Her disillusionment had begun the day after\nher arrival, when Dr Pughson, the Headmaster, to whom she had gone to\nbe examined in arithmetic, flung up hands of comical dismay at her\nbefogged attempts to solve the mysteries of long division. An upper\nclass was taking a lesson in Euclid, and in the intervals between her\nmazy reckonings she had stolen glances at the master. A tiny little\nnose was as if squashed flat on his face, above a grotesquely\nexpressive mouth, which displayed every one of a splendid set of teeth.\nHe had small, short-sighted, red-rimmed eyes, and curly hair which did\nnot stop growing at his ears, but went on curling, closely cropped,\ndown the sides of his face. He taught at the top of his voice, thumped\nthe blackboard with a pointer, was biting at the expense of a pupil who\nconfused the angle BFC with the angle BFG, a moment later to volley\nforth a broad Irish joke which convulsed the class. He bewitched Laura;\nshe forgot her sums in the delight of watching him; and this made her\nlearning seem a little scantier than it actually was; for she had to\nwind up in a great hurry. He pounced down upon her; the class laughed\nanew at his playful horror; and yet again at the remark that it was\nevident she had never had many pennies to spend, or she would know\nbetter what to do with the figures that represented them.--In these\nwords Laura scented a reference to Mother's small income, and grew as\nred as fire.\n\nIn the lowest class in the College she sat bottom, for a week or more:\nwhat she did know, she knew in such an awkward form that she might as\nwell have known nothing. And after a few efforts to better her\ncondition she grew cautious, and hesitated discreetly before returning\none of those ingenuous answers which, in the beginning, had made her\nthe merry-andrew of the class. She could for instance, read a French\nstory-book without skipping very many words; but she had never heard a\nsyllable of the language spoken, and her first attempts at\npronunciation caused even Miss Zielinski to sit back in her chair and\nlaugh till the tears ran down her face. History Laura knew in a vague,\npictorial way: she and Pin had enacted many a striking scene in the\ngarden--such as \"Not Angles but Angels,\" or, did the pump-drain\noverflow, Canute and his silly courtiers--and she also had\nout-of-the-way scraps of information about the characters of some of\nthe monarchs, or, as the governess had complained, about the state of\nLondon at a certain period; but she had never troubled her head with\ndates. Now they rose before her, a hard, dry, black line from 1066 on,\naccompanied, not only by the kings who were the cause of them, but by\ndull laws, and their duller repeals. Her lessons in English alone gave\nher a mild pleasure; she enjoyed taking a sentence to pieces to see how\nit was made. She was fond of words, too, for their own sake, and once,\nwhen Miss Snodgrass had occasion to use the term \"eleemosynary\", Laura\nwas so enchanted by it that she sought to share her enthusiasm with her\nneighbour. This girl, a fat little Jewess, went crimson, from trying to\nstifle her laughter.\n\n\"What IS the matter with you girls down there?\" cried Miss Snodgrass.\n\"Carrie Isaacs, what are you laughing like that for?\"\n\n\"It's Laura Rambotham, Miss Snodgrass. She's so funny,\" spluttered the\ngirl.\n\n\"What are you doing, Laura?\"\n\nLaura did not answer. The girl spoke for her.\n\n\"She said--hee, hee!--she said it was blue.\"\n\n\"Blue? What's blue?\" snapped Miss Snodgrass.\n\n\"That word. She said it was so beautiful ... and that it was blue.\"\n\n\"I didn't. Grey-blue, I said,\" murmured Laura her cheeks aflame.\n\nThe class rocked; even Miss Snodgrass herself had to join in the laugh\nwhile she hushed and reproved. And sometimes after this, when a\nparticularly long or odd word occurred in the lesson, she would turn to\nLaura and say jocosely: \"Now, Laura, come on, tell us what colour that\nis. Red and yellow, don't you think?\"\n\nBut these were \"Tom Fool's colours\"; and Laura kept a wise silence.\n\nOne day at geography, the pupils were required to copy the outline of\nthe map of England. Laura, about to begin, found to her dismay that she\nhad lost her pencil. To confess the loss meant one of the hard, public\nrebukes from which she shrank. And so, while the others drew, heads and\nbacks bent low over their desks, she fidgeted and sought--on her [P.72]\nlap, the bench, the floor.\n\n\"What on earth's the matter?\" asked her neighbour crossly; it was the\nblack-haired boarder who had winked at Laura the first evening at tea;\nher name was Bertha Ramsey. \"I can't draw a stroke if you shake like\nthat.\"\n\n\"I've lost my pencil.\"\n\nThe girl considered Laura for a moment, then pushed the lid from a box\nof long, beautifully sharpened drawing-pencils. \"Here, you can have one\nof these.\"\n\nLaura eyed the well-filled box admiringly, and modestly selected the\nshortest pencil. Bertha Ramsay, having finished her map, leaned back in\nher seat.\n\n\"And next time you feel inclined to boo-hoo at the tea-table, hold on\nto your eyebrows and sing Rule Britannia.--DID it want its mummy, poor\nickle sing?\"\n\nHere Bertha's chum, a girl called Inez, chimed in from the other side.\n\n\"It's all very well for you,\" she said to Bertha, in a deep, slow\nvoice. \"You're a weekly boarder.\"\n\nLaura had the wish to be very pleasant, in return for the pencil. So\nshe drew a sigh, and said, with over-emphasis: \"How nice for your\nmother to have you home every week!\"\n\nBertha only laughed at this, in a teasing way: \"Yes, isn't it?\" But\nInez leaned across behind her and gave Laura a poke.\n\n\"Shut up!\" she telegraphed.\n\n\"Who's talking down there?\" came the governess's cry. \"Here you, the\nnew girl, Laura what's--your-name, come up to the map.\"\n\nA huge map of England had been slung over an easel; Laura was required\nto take the pointer and show where Stafford lay. With the long stick in\nher hand, she stood stupid and confused. In this exigency, it did not\nhelp her that she knew, from hear-say, just how England looked; that\nshe could see, in fancy, its ever-green grass, thick hedges, and\nspreading trees; its never-dry rivers; its hoary old cathedrals; its\nfogs, and sea-mists, and over-populous cities. She stood face to face\nwith the most puzzling map in the world--a map seared and scored with\nboundary-lines, black and bristling with names. She could not have laid\nher finger on London at this moment, and as for Stafford, it might have\nbeen in the moon.\n\nWhile the class straggled along the verandah at the end of the hour,\nInez came up to Laura's side.\n\n\"I say, you shouldn't have said that about her mother.\" She nodded\nmysteriously.\n\n\"Why not?\" asked Laura, and coloured at the thought that she had again,\nwithout knowing it, been guilty of a FAUX PAS.\n\nInez looked round to see that Bertha was not within hearing, then put\nher lips to Laura's ear.\n\n\"She drinks.\"\n\nLaura gaped incredulous at the girl, her young eyes full of horror.\nFrom actual experience, she hardly knew what drunkenness meant; she had\nhitherto associated it only with the lowest class of Irish agricultural\nlabourer, or with those dreadful white women who lived, by choice, in\nChinese Camps. That there could exist a mother who drank was\nunthinkable ... outside the bounds of nature.\n\n\"Oh, how awful!\" she gasped, and turned pale with excitement. Inez\ncould not help giggling at the effect produced by her words--the new\ngirl was a 'rum stick' and no mistake--but as Laura's consternation\npersisted, she veered about.\n\n\"Oh, well, I don't know for certain if that's it. But there's something\nawfully queer about her.\"\n\n\"Oh, HOW do you know?\" asked her breathless listener, mastered by a\nmorbid curiosity.\n\n\"I've been there--at Vaucluse--from a Saturday till Monday. She came in\nto lunch, and she only talked to herself, not to us. She tried to eat\nmustard with her pudding too, and her meat was cut up in little pieces\nfor her. I guess if she'd had a knife she'd have cut our throats.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" was all Laura could get out.\n\n\"I was so frightened my mother said I shouldn't go again.\"\n\n\"Oh, I hope she won't ask me. What shall I do if she does?\"\n\n\"Look out, here she comes! Don't say a word. Bertha's awfully ashamed\nof it,\" said Inez, and Laura had just time to give a hasty promise.\n\n\"Hullo, you two, what are you gassing about?\" cried Bertha, and dealt\nout a couple of her rough and friendly punches.--\"I say, who's on for a\nrace up the garden?\"\n\nThey raced, all three, with flying plaits and curls, much kicking-up of\nlong black legs, and a frank display of frills and tuckers. Laura won;\nfor Inez's wind gave out half way, and Bertha was heavy of foot.\nLeaning against the palings Laura watched the latter come puffing up to\njoin her--Bertha with the shameful secret in the background, of a\nmother who was not like other mothers.\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\n\nLaura had been, for some six weeks or more, a listless and unsuccessful\npupil, when one morning she received an invitation from Godmother to\nspend the coming monthly holiday--from Saturday till Monday--at\nPrahran. The month before, she had been one of the few girls who had\nnowhere to go; she had been forced to pretend that she liked staying\nin, did it in fact by preference.--Now her spirits rose.\n\nMarina, Godmother's younger daughter, from whom Laura inherited her\nschool-books, was to call for her. By a little after nine o'clock on\nSaturday morning, Laura had finished her weekly mending, tidied her\nbedroom, and was ready dressed even to her gloves. It was a cool, crisp\nday; and her heart beat high with expectation.\n\nFrom the dining-hall, it was not possible to hear the ringing of the\nfront-door bell; but each time either of the maids entered with a\nsummons, Laura half rose from her chair, sure that her turn had come at\nlast. But it was half-past nine, then ten, then half-past; it struck\neleven, the best of the day was passing, and still Marina did not come.\nOnly two girls besides herself remained. Then respectively an aunt and\na mother were announced, and these two departed. Laura alone was left:\nshe had to bear the disgrace of Miss Day observing: \"Well, it looks as\nif YOUR friends had forgotten all about you, Laura.\"\n\nHumiliated beyond measure, Laura had thoughts of tearing off her hat\nand jacket and declaring that she felt too ill to go out. But at last,\nwhen she was almost sick with suspense, Mary put her tidy head in once\nmore.\n\n\"Miss Rambotham has been called for.\"\n\nLaura was on her feet before the words were spoken. She sped to the\nreception-room.\n\nMarina, a short, sleek-haired, soberly dressed girl of about twenty,\nhad Godmother's brisk, matter-of-fact manner.\n\nShe offered Laura her cheek to kiss. \"Well, I suppose you're ready now?\"\n\nLaura forgave her the past two hours. \"Yes, quite, thank you,\" she\nanswered.\n\nThey went down the asphalted path and through the garden-gate, and\nturned to walk townwards. For the first time since her arrival Laura\nwas free again--a prisoner at large. Round them stretched the broad\nwhite streets of East Melbourne; at their side was the thick, exotic\ngreenery of the Fitzroy Gardens; on the brow of the hill rose the\nmassive proportions of the Roman Catholic Cathedral.--Laura could have\ndanced, as she walked at Marina's side.\n\nAfter a few queries, however, as to how she liked school and how she\nwas getting on with her lessons, Marina fell to contemplating a strip\nof paper that she held in her hand. Laura gathered that her companion\nhad combined the task of calling for her with a morning's shopping, and\nthat she had only worked half through her list of commissions before\narriving at the College. At the next corner they got on to the outside\ncar of a cable-tramway, and were carried into town. Here Marina entered\na co-operative grocery store, where she was going to give an order for\na quarter's supplies. She was her mother's housekeeper, and had an\nincredible knowledge of groceries, as well as a severely practical\nmind: she stuck her finger-nail into butter, tasted cheeses off the\nblade of a knife, ran her hands through currants, nibbled biscuits,\ndiscussed brands of burgundy and desiccated soups--Laura meanwhile\nlooking on, from a high, uncomfortable chair, with a somewhat hungry\nenvy. When everything, down to pepper and salt, had been remembered,\nMarina filled in a cheque, and was just about to turn away when she\nrecollected an affair of some empty cases, which she wished to send\nback. Another ten minutes' parley ensued; she had to see the manager,\nand was closeted with him in his office, so that by the time they\nemerged into the street again a full hour had gone by.\n\n\"Getting hungry?\" she inquired of Laura.\n\n\"A little. But I can wait,\" answered Laura politely.\n\n\"That's right,\" said Marina, off whose own appetite the edge had no\ndoubt been taken by her various nibblings. \"Now there's only the\nchemist.\"\n\nThey rode to another street, entered a druggist's, and the same thing\non a smaller scale was repeated, except that here Marina did no\ntasting, but for a stray gelatine or jujube. By the time the shop door\nclosed behind them, Laura could almost have eaten liquorice powder. It\nwas two o'clock, and she was faint with hunger.\n\n\"We'll be home in plenty of time,\" said Marina, consulting a neat\nwatch. \"Dinner's not till three today, because of father.\"\n\nAgain a tramway jerked them forward. Some half mile from their\ndestination, Marina rose.\n\n\"We'll get out here. I have to call at the butcher's.\"\n\nAt a quarter to three, it was a very white-faced, exhausted little girl\nthat followed her companion into the house.\n\n\"Well, I guess you'll have a fine healthy appetite for dinner,\" said\nMarina, as she showed her where to hang up her hat and wash her hands.\n\nGodmother was equally optimistic. From the sofa of the morning-room,\nwhere she sat knitting, she said: \"Well, YOU'VE had a fine morning's\ngadding about I must say! How are you? And how's your dear mother?\"\n\n\"Quite well, thank you.\"\n\nGodmother scratched her head with a spare needle, and the attention she\nhad had for Laura evaporated. \"I hope, Marina, you told Graves about\nthose empty jam-jars he didn't take back last time?\"\n\nMarina, without lifting her eyes from a letter she was reading,\nreturned: \"Indeed I didn't. He made such a rumpus about the sugar-boxes\nthat I thought I'd try to sell them to Petersen instead.\"\n\nGodmother grunted, but did not question Marina's decision. \"And what\nnews have you from your dear mother?\" she asked again, without looking\nat Laura--just as she never looked at the stocking she held, but always\nover the top of it.\n\nHere, however, the dinner-bell rang, and Laura, spared the task of\ngiving more superfluous information, followed the two ladies to the\ndining-room. The other members of the family were waiting at the table.\nGodmother's husband--he was a lawyer--was a morose, black-bearded man\nwho, for the most part, kept his eyes fixed on his plate. Laura had\nheard it said that he and Godmother did not get on well together; she\nsupposed this meant that they did not care to talk to each other, for\nthey never exchanged a direct word: if they had to communicate, it was\ndone by means of a third person. There was the elder daughter,\nGeorgina, dumpier and still brusquer than Marina, the eldest son, a\nbank-clerk who was something of a dandy and did not waste civility on\nlittle girls; and lastly there were two boys, slightly younger than\nLaura, black-haired, pug-nosed, pugnacious little creatures, who stood\nin awe of their father, and were all the wilder when not under his eye.\n\nGodmother mumbled a blessing; and the soup was eaten in silence.\n\nDuring the meat course, the bank-clerk complained in extreme\ndispleasure of the way the laundress had of late dressed his\ncollars--these were so high that, as Laura was not slow to notice, he\nhad to look straight down the two sides of his nose to see his\nplate--and announced that he would not be home for tea, as he had an\nappointment to meet some 'chappies' at five, and in the evening was\ngoing to take a lady friend to Brock's Fireworks. These particulars\nwere received without comment. As the family plied its pudding-spoons,\nGeorgina in her turn made a statement.\n\n\"Joey's coming to take me driving at four.\"\n\nIt looked as if this remark, too, would founder on the general\nindifference. Then Marina said warningly, as if recalling her parent's\nthoughts: \"Mother!\"\n\nAwakened, Godmother jerked out: \"Indeed and I hope if you go you'll\ntake the boys with you!\"\n\n\"Indeed and I don't see why we should!\"\n\n\"Very well, then, you'll stop at home. If Joey doesn't choose to come\nto the point-----\"\n\n\"Now hold your tongue, mother!\"\n\n\"I'll do nothing of the sort.\"\n\n\"Crikey!\" said the younger boy, Erwin, in a low voice. \"Joey's got to\ntake us riding.\"\n\n\"If you and Joey can't get yourselves properly engaged,\" snapped\nGodmother, \"then you shan't go driving without the boys, and that's the\nend of it.\"\n\nLike dogs barking at one another, thought Laura, listening to the\nloveless bandying of words--she was unused to the snappishness of the\nIrish manner, which sounds so much worse than it is meant to be: and\nshe was chilled anew by it when, over the telephone, she heard Georgy\nholding a heated conversation with Joey.\n\nHe was a fat young man, with hanging cheeks, small eyes, and a lazy,\nlopsided walk.\n\n\"Hello--here's a little girl! What's HER name?--Say, this kiddy can\ncome along too.\"\n\nAs it had leaked out that Marina's afternoon would be spent between the\nshelves of her storeroom, preparing for the incoming goods, Laura\ngratefully accepted the offer.\n\nThey drove to Marlborough Tower. With their backs to the horse sat the\ntwo boys, mercilessly alert for any display of fondness on the part of\nthe lovers; sat Laura, with her straight, inquisitive black eyes. Hence\nJoey and Georgy were silent, since, except to declare their feelings,\nthey had nothing to say to each other.\n\nThe Tower reached, the mare was hitched up and the ascent of the light\nwooden erection began. It was a blowy day.\n\n\"Boys first!\" commanded Joey. \"Cos o' the petticuts.\"--His speech was\nas lazy as his walk.\n\nHe himself led the way, followed by Erwin and Marmaduke, and Laura, at\nGeorgy's bidding, went next. She clasped her bits of skirts anxiously\nto her knees, for she was just as averse to the frills and flounces\nthat lay beneath being seen by Georgy, as by any of the male members of\nthe party. Georgy came last, and, though no one was below her, so\ntightly wound about was she that she could hardly advance her legs from\none step to another. Joey looked approval; but the boys sniggered, and\nkept it up till Georgy, having gained the platform, threatened them\nwith a \"clout on the head\".\n\nOn the return journey a dispute arose between the lovers: it related to\nthe shortest road home, waxed hot, and was rapidly taking on the\ndimensions of a quarrel, when the piebald mare shied at a\ntraction-engine and tried to bolt. Joey gripped the reins, and passed\nhis free arm round Georgy's waist.\n\n\"Don't be frightened, darling.\"\n\nThough the low chaise rocked from side to side and there seemed a\nlikelihood of it capsizing, the two boys squirmed with laughter, and\ndealt out sundry nudges, kicks and pokes, all of which were received by\nLaura, sitting between them. She herself turned red--with\nembarrassment. At the same time she wondered why Joey should believe\nGeorge was afraid; there was no sign of it in Georgy's manner; she sat\nstolid and unmoved. Besides she, Laura, was only a little girl, and\nfelt no fear.--She also asked herself why Joey should suddenly grow\nconcerned about Georgy, when, a moment before, they had been so rude to\neach other.--These were interesting speculations, and, the chaise\nhaving ceased to sway, Laura grew meditative.\n\nIn the evening Godmother had a visitor, and Laura sat in a low chair,\nlistening to the ladies' talk. It was dull work: for, much as she liked\nto consider herself \"almost grown up\", she yet detested the\nconversation of \"real grown-ups\" with a child's heartiness. She was\nglad when nine o'clock struck and Marina, lighting a candle, told her\nto go to bed.\n\nThe next day was Sunday. Between breakfast and church-time yawned two\nlong hours. Georgy went to a Bible-class; Marina was busy with orders\nfor the dinner.\n\nIt was a bookless house--like most Australian houses of its kind: in\nMarina's bedroom alone stood a small bookcase containing school and\nSunday school prizes. Laura was very fond of reading, and as she\ndressed that morning had cast longing looks at these volumes, had\nevenly shyly fingered the glass doors. But they were locked. Breakfast\nover, she approached Marina on the subject. The latter produced the\nkey, but only after some haggling, for her idea of books was to keep\nthe gilt on their covers untarnished.\n\n\"Well, at any rate it must be a Sunday book,\" she said ungraciously.\n\nShe drew out THE GIANT CITIES OF BASHAN AND SYRIA'S HOLY PLACES, and\nwith this Laura retired to the drawing-room, where Godmother was\nalready settled for the day, with a suitable magazine. When the bells\nbegan to clang the young people, primly hatted, their prayer-books in\ntheir hands, walked to the neighbouring church. There Laura sat once\nmore between the boys, Marina and Georgy stationed like sentinels at\nthe ends of the pew, ready to pounce down on their brothers if\nnecessary, to confiscate animals and eatables, or to rap impish\nknuckles with a Bible. It was a spacious church; the pew was in a side\naisle; one could see neither reading-desk nor pulpit; and the words of\nthe sermon seemed to come from a great way off.\n\nAfter dinner, Laura and the boys were dispatched to the garden, to\nstroll about in Sunday fashion. Here no elder person being present, the\nnatural feelings of the trio came out: the distaste of a quiet little\ngirl for rough boys and their pranks; the resentful indignation of the\nboys at having their steps dogged by a sneak and a tell-tale. As soon\nas they had rounded the tennis-court and were out of sight of the\nhouse, Erwin and Marmaduke clambered over the palings and dropped into\nthe street, vowing a mysterious vengeance on Laura if she went indoors\nwithout them. The child sat down on the edge of the lawn under a\nmulberry tree and propped her chin on her hands. She was too timid to\nreturn to the house and brave things out; she was also afraid of some\none coming into the garden and finding her alone, and of her then being\nforced to \"tell\"; for most of all she feared the boys, and their vague,\nrude threats. So she sat and waited ... and waited. The shadows on the\ngrass changed their shapes before her eyes; distant chapel-bells\ntinkled their quarter of an hour and were still again; the blighting\ntorpor of a Sunday afternoon lay over the world. Would to-morrow ever\ncome? She counted on her fingers the hours that had still to crawl by\nbefore she could get back to school--counted twice over to be sure of\nthem--and all but yawned her head off, with ennui. But time passed, and\npassed, and nothing happened. She was on the verge of tears, when two\nblack heads bobbed up above the fence, the boys scrambled over, red and\nbreathless, and hurried her into tea.\n\nShe wakened next morning at daybreak, so eager was she to set out. But\nMarina had a hundred and one odd jobs to do before she was ready to\nstart, and it struck half-past nine as the two of them neared the\nCollege. Child-like, Laura felt no special gratitude for the heavy pot\nof mulberry jam Marina bore on her arm; but at sight of the stern,\ngrey, stone building she could have danced with joy; and on the front\ndoor swinging to behind her, she drew a deep sigh of relief.\n\n\n\n\nIX.\n\n\nFrom this moment on--the moment when Mary the maid's pleasant smile\nsaluted her--Laura's opinion of life at school suffered a change. She\nwas glad to be back--that was the first point: just as an adventurous\nsheep is glad to regain the cover of the flock. Learning might be hard;\nthe governesses mercilessly secure in their own wisdom; but here she\nwas at least a person of some consequence, instead of as at Godmother's\na mere negligible null.\n\nOf her unlucky essay at holiday-making she wrote home guardedly: the\nmost tell-tale sentence in her letter was that in which she said she\nwould rather not go to Godmother's again in the meantime. But there was\nsuch a lack of warmth in her account of the visit that mother made\nthis, together with the above remark, the text for a scolding.\n\n\"YOU'RE A VERY UNGRATEFUL GIRL,\" she wrote, \"TO FORGET ALL GODMOTHER\nHAS DONE FOR YOU. IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR HER SUPPLYING YOU WITH BOOKS\nAND THINGS I COULDN'T HAVE SENT YOU TO SCHOOL AT ALL. AND I HOPE WHEN\nYOU GROW UP YOU'LL BE AS MUCH OF A HELP TO ME AS MARINA IS TO HER\nMOTHER. I'D MUCH RATHER HAVE YOU GOOD AND USEFUL THAN CLEVER AND I\nTHINK FOR A CHILD OF YOUR AGE YOU SEE THINGS WITH VERY SHARP UNKIND\nEYES. TRY AND ONLY THINK NICE THINGS ABOUT PEOPLE AND NOT BE ALWAYS\nSPYING OUT THEIR FAULTS. THEN YOU'LL HAVE PLENTY OF FRIENDS AND BE\nLIKED WHEREVER YOU GO.\"\n\nLaura took the statement about the goodness and cleverness with a grain\nof salt: she knew better. Mother thought it the proper thing to say,\nand she would certainly have preferred the two qualities combined; but,\nhad she been forced to choose between them, there was small doubt how\nher choice would have fallen out. And if, for instance, Laura confessed\nthat her teachers did not regard her as even passably intelligent,\nthere would be a nice to-do. Mother's ambitions knew no bounds; and,\nwounded in these, she was quite capable of writing post-haste to Mrs.\nGurley or Mr. Strachey, complaining of their want of insight, and\nbringing forward a string of embarrassing proofs. So, leaving Mother to\nher pleasing illusions, Laura settled down again to her role of dunce,\nnow, though, with more equanimity than before. School was really not a\nbad place after all--this had for some time been her growing\nconviction, and the visit to Godmother seemed to bring it to a head.\n\nAbout this time, too, a couple of pieces of good fortune came her way.\n\nThe first: she was privileged to be third in the friendship between\nInez and Bertha--a favour of which she availed herself eagerly, though\nthe three were as different from one another as three little girls\ncould be. Bertha was a good-natured romp, hard-fisted, thick of leg,\nand of a plodding but ineffectual industry. Inez, on the other hand,\nwas so pretty that Laura never tired of looking at her: she had a pale\nskin, hazel eyes, brown hair with a yellow light in it, and a Greek\nnose. Her mouth was very small; her nostrils were mere tiny slits; and\nso lazy was she that she seldom more than half opened her eyes. Both\ngirls were well over fourteen, and very fully developed: compared with\nthem, Laura was like nothing so much as a skinny young colt.\n\nShe was so grateful to them for tolerating her that she never took up a\nstand of real equality with them: proud and sensitive, she was always\nready to draw back and admit their prior rights to each other; hence\nthe friendship did not advance to intimacy. But such as it was, it was\nvery comforting; she no longer needed to sit alone in recess; she could\nlink arms and walk the garden with complacency; and many were the\nsupercilious glances she now threw at Maria Morell and that clique; for\nher new friends belonged socially to the best set in the school.\n\nIn another way, too, their company made things easier for her: neither\nof them aimed high; and both were well content with the lowly places\nthey occupied in the class. And so Laura, who was still, in her young\nconfusion, unequal to discovering what was wanted of her, grew\ncomforted by the presence and support of her friends, and unmindful of\nhigher opinion; and Miss Chapman, in supervising evening lessons,\nremarked with genuine regret that little Laura was growing perky and\nlazy.\n\nHer second piece of good luck was of quite a different nature.\n\nMiss Hicks, the visiting governess for geography, had a gift for saying\nbiting things that really bit. She bore Inez a peculiar grudge; for she\nbelieved that certain faculties slumbered behind the Grecian profile,\nand that only the girl's ingrained sloth prevented them.\n\nOne day she lost patience with this sluggish pupil.\n\n\"I'll tell you what it is, Inez,\" she said; \"you're blessed with a real\nwoman's brain: vague, slippery, inexact, interested only in the\npersonal aspect of a thing. You can't concentrate your thoughts, and,\nworst of all, you've no curiosity--about anything that really matters.\nYou take all the great facts of existence on trust--just as a hen\ndoes--and I've no doubt you'll go on contentedly till the end of your\ndays, without ever knowing why the ocean has tides, and what causes the\nseasons.--It makes me ashamed to belong to the same sex.\"\n\nInez's classmates tittered furiously, let the sarcasm glide over them,\nunhit by its truth. Inez herself, indeed, was inclined to consider the\ngoverness's taunt a compliment, as proving that she was incapable of a\nvulgar inquisitiveness. But Laura, though she laughed docilely with the\nrest, could not forget the incident--words in any case had a way of\nsticking to her memory--and what Miss Hicks had said often came back to\nher, in the days that followed. And then, all of a sudden, just as if\nan invisible hand had opened the door to an inner chamber, a light\nbroke on her. Vague, slippery, inexact, interested only in the\npersonal--every word struck home. Had Miss Hicks set out to describe\nHER, in particular, she could not have done it more accurately. It was\nbut too true: until now, she, Laura, had been satisfied to know things\nin a slipslop, razzle-dazzle way, to know them anyhow, as it best\nsuited herself. She had never set to work to master a subject, to make\nit her own in every detail. Bits of it, picturesque scraps, striking\nfeatures--what Miss Hicks no doubt meant by the personal--were all that\nhad attracted her.--Oh, and she, too, had no intelligent curiosity. She\ncould not say that she had ever teased her brains with wondering why\nthe earth went round the sun and not the sun round the earth. Honestly\nspeaking, it made no difference to her that the globe was indented like\nan orange, and not the perfect round you began by believing it to\nbe.--But if this were so, if she were forced to make these galling\nadmissions, then it was clear that her vaunted cleverness had never\nexisted, except in Mother's imagination. Or, at any rate, it had\ncrumbled to pieces like a lump of earth, under the hard, heavy hand of\nMiss Hicks. Laura felt humiliated, and could not understand her\ncompanions treating the matter so airily. She did not want to have a\nwoman's brain, thank you; not one of that sort; and she smarted for the\nwhole class.\n\nStraightway she set to work to sharpen her wits, to follow the strait\nroad. At first with some stumbling, of course, and frequent\nbackslidings. Intellectual curiosity could not, she discovered, be\nawakened to order; and she often caught herself napping. Thus though\nshe speedily became one of the most troublesome askers-why, her desire\nfor information was apt to exhaust itself in putting the question, and\nshe would forget to listen to the answer. Besides, for the life of her\nshe could not drum up more interest in, say, the course of the Gulf\nStream, or the formation of a plateau, than in the fact that, when\nNelly Bristow spoke, little bubbles came out of her mouth, and that she\nneeded to swallow twice as often as other people; or that when Miss\nHicks grew angry her voice had a way of failing, at the crucial moment,\nand flattening out to nothing--just as if one struck tin after brass.\nNo, it was indeed difficult for Laura to invert the value of these\nthings.--In another direction she did better. By dint of close\nattention, of pondering both the questions asked by Miss Hicks, and the\nreplies made by the cleverest pupils, she began to see more clearly\nwhere true knowledge lay. It was facts that were wanted of her; facts\nthat were the real test of learning; facts she was expected to know.\nStories, pictures of things, would not help her an inch along the road.\nThus, it was not the least use in the world to her to have seen the\nsnowy top of Mount Kosciusko stand out against a dark blue evening sky,\nand to know its shape to a tittlekin. On the other hand, it mattered\ntremendously that this mountain was 7308 and not 7309 feet high: that\npiece of information was valuable, was of genuine use to you; for it\nwas worth your place in the class.\n\nThus did Laura apply herself to reach the school ideal, thus force\nherself to drive hard nails of fact into her vagrant thoughts. And with\nsuccess. For she had, it turned out, a retentive memory, and to her joy\nlearning by heart came easy to her--as easy as to the most brilliant\nscholars in the form. From now on she gave this talent full play,\nmemorising even pages of the history book in her zeal; and before many\nweeks had passed, in all lessons except those in arithmetic--you could\nnot, alas! get sums by rote--she was separated from Inez and Bertha by\nthe width of the class.\n\nBut neither her taste of friendship and its comforts, nor the abrupt\nchange for the better in her class-fortunes, could counterbalance\nLaura's luckless knack of putting her foot in it. This she continued to\ndo, in season and out of season. And not with the authorities alone.\n\nThere was, for instance, that unfortunate evening when she was one of\nthe batch of girls invited to Mrs. Strachey's drawingroom. Laura,\nignorant of what it meant to be blasee, had received her note of\ninvitation with a thrill, had even enjoyed writing, in her best hand,\nthe prescribed formula of acceptance. But she was alone in this; by the\nmajority of her companions these weekly parties were frankly hated, the\nchief reason being that every guest was expected to take a piece of\nmusic with her. Even the totally unfit had to show what they could do.\nAnd the fact that cream-tarts were served for supper was not held to\nsquare accounts.\n\n\"It's all very well for you,\" grumbled Laura's room-mate, Lilith\nGordon, as she lathered her thick white arms and neck before dressing.\n\"You're a new girl; you probably won't be asked.\"\n\nLaura did not give the matter a second thought: hastily selecting a\nvolume of music, she followed the rest of the white dresses into the\npassage. The senior girl tapped at the drawingroom door. It was opened\nby no other than the Principal himself.\n\nIn the girls' eyes, Mr. Strachey stood over six feet in his\nstocking-soles. He had also a most arrogant way of looking down his\nnose, and of tugging, intolerantly, at his long, drooping moustache.\nThere was little need for him to assume the frigid contemptuousness of\nMrs. Gurley's manner: his mere presence, the very unseeingness of his\ngaze, inspired awe. Tales ran of his wrath, were it roused; but few had\nexperienced it. He quelled the high spirits of these young [P.93]\ncolonials by his dignified air of detachment.\n\nNow, however, he stood there affable and smiling, endeavouring to put a\nhandful of awkward girls at their ease. But neither his nor Mrs.\nStrachey's efforts availed. It was impossible for the pupils to throw\noff, at will, the crippling fear that governed their relations with the\nPrincipal. To them, his amiability resembled the antics of an\nuncertain-tempered elephant, with which you could never feel safe.--\nBesides on this occasion it was a young batch, and of particularly\nmixed stations. And so a dozen girls, from twelve to fifteen years old,\nsat on the extreme edges of their chairs, and replied to what was said\nto them, with dry throats.\n\nThough the youngest of the party, Laura was the least embarrassed: she\nhad never known a nursery, but had mixed with her elders since her\nbabyhood. And she was not of a shy disposition; indeed, she still had\nto be reminded daily that shyness was expected of her. So she sat and\nlooked about her. It was an interesting room in which she found\nherself. Low bookshelves, three shelves high, ran round the walls, and\non the top shelf were many outlandish objects. What an evening it would\nhave been had Mr. Strachey invited them to examine these ornaments, or\nto handle the books, instead of having to pick up a title here and\nthere by chance.--From the shelves, her eyes strayed to the pictures on\nthe walls; one, in particular struck her fancy. It hung over the\nmantelpiece, and was a man's head seen in profile, with a long hooked\nnose, and wearing a kind of peaked cap. But that was not all: behind\nthis head were other profiles of the same face, and seeming to come out\nof clouds. Laura stared hard, but could make nothing of it.--And\nmeanwhile her companions were rising with sickly smiles, to seat\nthemselves, red as turkey-cocks' combs, on the piano stool, where with\ncold, stiff fingers they stumbled through the movement of a sonata or\nsonatina.\n\nIt was Lilith Gordon who broke the chain by offering to sing. The\ndiversion was welcomed by Mrs. Strachey, and Lilith went to the piano.\nBut her nervousness was such that she broke down half-way in the little\nprelude to the ballad.\n\nMrs. Strachey came to the rescue. \"It's so difficult, is it not, to\naccompany oneself?\" she said kindly. \"Perhaps one of the others would\nplay for you?\"\n\nNo one moved.\n\n\"Do any of you know the song?\"\n\nTwo or three ungraciously admitted the knowledge, but none volunteered.\n\nIt was here Laura chimed in. \"I could play it,\" she said; and coloured\nat the sound of her own voice.\n\nMrs. Strachey looked doubtfully at the thin little girl. \"Do you know\nit, dear? You're too young for singing, I think.\"\n\n\"No, I don't know it. But I could play it from sight. It's quite easy.\"\n\nEveryone looked disbelieving, especially the unhappy singer.\n\n\"I've played much harder things than that,\" continued Laura.\n\n\"Well, perhaps you might try,\" said Mrs. Strachey, with the ingrained\ndistrust of the unmusical.\n\nLaura rose and went to the piano, where she conducted the song to a\nsuccessful ending.\n\nMrs. Strachey looked relieved. \"Very nice indeed.\" And to Laura: \"Did\nyou say you didn't know it, dear?\"\n\n\"No, I never saw it before.\"\n\nAgain the lady looked doubtful. \"Well, perhaps you would play us\nsomething yourself now?\"\n\nLaura had no objection; she had played to people before her fingers\nwere long enough to cover the octave. She took the volume of Thalberg\nshe had brought with her, selected \"Home, Sweet Home\", and pranced in.\n\nHer audience kept utter silence; but, had she been a little sharper,\nshe would have grasped that it was the silence of amazement. After the\nprim sonatinas that had gone before, Thalberg's florid ornaments had a\nshameless sound. Her performance, moreover, was a startling one; the\nforte pedal was held down throughout; the big chords were crashed and\nbanged with all the strength a pair of twelve-year-old arms could put\ninto them; and wrong notes were freely scattered. Still, rhythm and\nmelody were well marked, and there was no mistaking the agility of the\nsmall fingers.\n\nDead silence, too, greeted the conclusion of the piece Several girls\nwere very red, from trying not to laugh. The Principal tugged at his\nmoustache, in abstracted fashion.\n\nLaura had reached her seat again before Mrs. Strachey said undecidedly:\n\"Thank you, dear. Did you ... hm ... learn that piece here?\"\n\nLaura saw nothing wrong. \"Oh, no, at home,\" she answered. \"I wouldn't\ncare to play the things I learn here, to people. They're so dull.\"\n\nA girl emitted a faint squeak. But a half turn of Mrs. Strachey's head\nsubdued her. \"Oh, I hope you will soon get to like classical music\nalso,\" said the lady gravely, and in all good faith. \"We prefer it, you\nknow, to any other.\"\n\n\"Do you mean things like the AIR IN G WITH VARIATIONS? I'm afraid I\nnever shall. There's no tune in them.\"\n\nMusic was as fatal to Laura's equilibrium as wine would have been.\nFinding herself next Mr. Strachey, she now turned to him and said, with\nwhat she believed to be ease of manner: \"Mr. Strachey, will you please\ntell me what that picture is hanging over the mantelpiece? I've been\nlooking at it ever since I came in, but I can't make it out. Are those\nghosts, those things behind the man, or what?\"\n\nIt took Mr. Strachey a minute to recover from his astonishment. He\nstroked hard, and the look he bent on Laura was not encouraging.\n\n\"It seems to be all the same face,\" continued the child, her eyes on\nthe picture.\n\n\"That,\" said Mr. Strachey, with extreme deliberation: \"that is the\nportrait, by a great painter, of a great poet--Dante Alighieri.\"\n\n\"Oh, Dante, is it?\" said Laura showily--she had once heard the name.\n\"Oh, yes, of course, I know now. He wrote a book, didn't he, called\nFAUST? I saw it over there by the door.--What lovely books!\"\n\nBut here Mr. Strachey abruptly changed his seat, and Laura's thirst for\ninformation was left unquenched.\n\nThe evening passed, and she was in blessed ignorance of anything being\namiss, till the next morning after breakfast she was bidden to Mrs.\nGurley.\n\nA quarter of an hour later, on her emerging from that lady's private\nsitting-room, her eyes were mere swollen slits in her face. Instead,\nhowever, of sponging them in cold water and bravely joining her\nfriends, Laura was still foolish enough to hide and have her cry out.\nSo that when the bell rang, she was obliged to go in to public prayers\nlooking a prodigious fright, and thereby advertising to the curious\nwhat had taken place.\n\nMrs. Gurley had crushed and humiliated her. Laura learnt that she had\nbeen guilty of a gross impertinence, in profaning the ears of the\nPrincipal and Mrs. Strachey with Thalberg's music, and that all the\npieces she had brought with her from home would now be taken from her.\nSecondly, Mr. Strachey had been so unpleasantly impressed by the\nboldness of her behaviour, that she would not be invited to the\ndrawing-room again for some time to come.\n\nThe matter of the music touched Laura little: if they preferred their\ndull old exercises to what she had offered them, so much the worse for\nthem. But the reproach cast on her manners stung her even more deeply\nthan it had done when she was still the raw little newcomer: for she\nhad been pluming herself of late that she was now \"quite the thing\".\n\nAnd yet, painful as was this fresh overthrow of her pride, it was\nneither the worst nor the most lasting result of the incident. That\nconcerned her schoolfellows. By the following morning the tale of her\ndoings was known to everyone. It was circulated in the first place, no\ndoubt, by Lilith Gordon, who bore her a grudge for her offer to\naccompany the song: had Laura not put herself forward in this\nobjectionable way, Lilith might have escaped singing altogether. Lilith\nalso resented her having shown that she could do it--and this feeling\nwas generally shared. It evidenced a want of good-fellowship, and made\nyou very glad the little prig had afterwards come to grief: if you had\nabilities that others had not you concealed them, instead of parading\nthem under people's noses.\n\nIn short, Laura had committed a twofold breach of school etiquette. No\none of course vouchsafed to explain this to her; these things one did\nnot put into words, things you were expected to know without telling.\nHence, she never more than half understood what she had done. She only\nsaw disapproval painted on faces that had hitherto been neutral, and\nfrom one or two quarters got what was unmistakably the cold shoulder.--\nHer little beginnings at popularity had somehow received a setback, and\nthrough her own foolish behaviour.\n\n\n\n\nX.\n\n\nThe lesson went home; Laura began to model herself more and more on\nthose around her; to grasp that the unpardonable sin is to vary from\nthe common mould.\n\nIn August, after the midwinter holidays, she was promoted to the second\nclass; she began Latin; and as a reward was allowed by Mother to wear\nher dresses an inch below her knees. She became a quick, adaptable\npupil, with a parrot-like memory, and at the end of the school year\ndelighted Mother's heart with a couple of highly gilt volumes, of\nnegligible contents.\n\nAt home, during those first holidays, she gave her sister and brothers\ncold creeps down their spines, with her stories of the great doings\nthat took place at school; and none of her class-mates would have\nrecognised in this arrant drawer-of-the-long-bow, the unlucky little\nblunderbuss of the early days.\n\nOn her return, Laura's circle of friends was enlarged. The morning\nafter her arrival, on entering the dining-hall, she found a new girl\nstanding shy and awkward before the fireplace. This was the daughter of\na millionaire squatter named Macnamara; and the report of her father's\nwealth had preceded her. Yet here she now had to hang about, alone,\nunhappy, the target of all eyes. It might be supposed that Laura would\nfeel some sympathy for her, having so recently undergone the same\nexperience herself. But that was not her way. She rejoiced, in\nbarbarian fashion, that this girl, older than she by about a year, and\nof a higher social standing, should have to endure a like ordeal.\nStaring heartlessly, she accentuated her part of old girl knowing all\nthe ropes, and was so inclined to show off that she let herself in for\na snub from Miss Snodgrass.\n\nTilly Macnamara joined Laura's class, and the two were soon good\nfriends.\n\nTilly was a short, plump girl, with white teeth, rather boyish hands,\nand the blue-grey eyes predominant in Australia. She was usually\ndressed in silk, and she never wore an apron to protect the front of\nher frock. Naturally, too, she had a bottomless supply of pocket-money:\nif a subscription were raised, she gave ten shillings where others gave\none; and on the Saturday holidays she flung about with half-crowns as\nLaura would have been afraid to do with pennies.\n\nFor the latter with her tiny dole, which had to last so and so long,\nsince no more was forthcoming, it was a difficult task to move\ngracefully among companions none of whom knew what it meant to be\nreally poor. Many trivial mortifications were the result; and countless\nsmall subterfuges had to be resorted to, to prevent it leaking out just\nhow paltry her allowance was.\n\nBut the question of money was, after all, trifling, compared with the\ninfinitely more important one of dress.\n\nWith regard to dress, Laura's troubles were manifold. It was not only\nthat here, too, by reason of Mother's straitened means, she was forced\nto remain an outsider: that, in itself, she would have borne [P.101]\nlightly; for, as little girls go, she was indifferent to finery. Had\nshe had a couple of new frocks a year, in which she could have been\nneat and unremarkable, she would have been more than content. But, from\nher babyhood on, Laura--and Pin with her--had lamented the fact that\nchildren could not go about clad in sacks, mercifully indistinguishable\none from another. For they were the daughters of an imaginative mother,\nand, balked in other outlets, this imagination had wreaked itself on\ntheir clothing. All her short life long, Laura had suffered under a\nhome-made, picturesque style of dress; and she had resented, with a\nviolence even Mother did not gauge, this use of her young body as a peg\non which to hang fantastic garments. After her tenth birthday she was,\nshe thanked goodness, considered too old for the quaint shapes beneath\nwhich Pin still groaned; but there remained the matter of colour for\nMother to sin against, and in this she seemed to grow more intemperate\nyear by year. Herself dressed always in the soberest browns and blacks,\nshe liked to see her young flock gay as Paradise birds, lighting up a\ndrab world; and when Mother liked a thing, she was not given to\nconsulting the wishes of little people. Those were awful times when she\nwent, say, to Melbourne, and bought as a bargain a whole roll of cloth\nof an impossible colour, which had to be utilised to the last inch; or\nwhen she unearthed, from an old trunk, some antiquated garment to be\ncut up and reshaped--a Paisley shawl, a puce ball-dress, even an old\npair of green rep curtains.\n\nIt was thus a heavy blow to Laura to find, on going home, that Mother\nhad already bought her new spring dress. In one respect all was well:\nit had been made by the local dressmaker, and consequently had not the\nhome-made cut that Laura abhorred. But the colour! Her heart fell to\nthe pit of her stomach the moment she set eyes on it, and only with\ndifficulty did she restrain her tears.--Mother had chosen a vivid\npurple, of a crude, old-fashioned shade.\n\nNow, quite apart from her personal feelings, Laura had come to know\nvery exactly, during the few months she had been at school, the views\nheld by her companions on the subject of colour. No matter how\nsumptuous or how simple the material of which the dress was made, it\nmust be dark, or of a delicate tint. Brilliancy was a sign of\nvulgarity, and put the wearer outside the better circles. Hence, at\nthis critical juncture, when Laura was striving to ape her fellows in\nall vital matters, the unpropitious advent of the purple threatened to\nundo her.\n\nAfter her first dismayed inspection, she retreated to the bottom of the\ngarden to give vent to her feelings.\n\n\"I shall never be able to wear it,\" she moaned. \"Oh, how COULD she buy\nsuch a thing? And I needed a new dress so awfully, awfully much.\"\n\n\"It isn't really so bad, Laura,\" pleaded Pin. \"It'll look darker, I'm\nsure, if you've got it on--and if you don't go out in the sun.\"\n\n\"You haven't got to wear it. It was piggish of you, Pin, perfectly\npiggish! You MIGHT have watched what she was buying.\"\n\n\"I did, Laura!\" asseverated Pin, on the brink of tears. \"There was a\nnice dark brown and I said take that, you would like it better, and she\nsaid hold your tongue, and did I think she was going to dress you as if\nyou were your own grandmother.\"\n\nThis dress hung for weeks in the most private corner of Laura's school\nwardrobe. Her companions had all returned with new outfits, and on the\nfirst assemblage for church there was a great mustering of one another,\nboth by girls and teachers. Laura was the only one to descend in the\ndress she had worn throughout the winter. Her heart was sore with\nbitterness, and when the handful of Episcopalians were marching to St\nStephen's-on-the-Hill, she strove to soothe her own wound.\n\n\"I can't think why my dress hasn't come,\" she said gratuitously, out of\nthis hurt, with an oblique glance to see how her partner took the\nremark: it was the good-natured Maria Morell, who was resplendent in\nvelvet and feathers. \"I expect that stupid dressmaker couldn't get it\ndone in time. I've waited for it all the week.\"\n\n\"What a sell!\" said Maria, but with mediocre interest; for she had\ncocked her eye at a harmless-looking youth, who was doing his best not\nto blush on passing the line of girls.--\"I say, do look at that toff\nmaking eyes. Isn't he a nanny-goat.\"\n\nOn several subsequent Sundays, Laura fingered, in an agony of\nindecision, the pleasing stuff of the dress, and ruefully considered\nits modish cut. Once, no one being present, she even took it out of the\nwardrobe. But the merciless spring sunshine seemed to make the purple\nshoot fire, to let loose a host of other colours it in as well, and,\nwith a shudder, she re-hung it on its peg.\n\nBut the evil day came. After a holiday at Godmother's, she received a\nhot letter from Mother. Godmother had complained of her looking\n\"dowdy\", and Mother was exceedingly cross. Laura was ordered to spend\nthe coming Saturday as well at Prahran, and in her new dress, under\npenalty of a correspondence with Mrs. Gurley. There was no going\nagainst an order of this kind, and with death at her heart Laura\nprepared to obey. On the fatal morning she dawdled as long as possible\nover her mending, thus postponing dressing to go out till the others\nhad vacated the bedroom; where, in order not to be forced to see\nherself, she kept her eyes half shut, and turned the looking-glass\nhind-before. Although it was a warm day, she hung a cloak over her\nshoulders. But her arms peeped out of the loose sleeves, and at least a\nfoot of skirt was visible. As she walked along the corridor and down\nthe stairs, she seemed to smudge the place with colour, and, directly\nshe entered the dining-hall, comet-like she drew all eyes upon her.\nAstonished titterings followed in her wake; even the teachers goggled\nher, afterwards to put their heads together. In the reception-room\nMarina remarked at once: \"Hullo!--is THIS the new dress your mother\nwrote us about?\"\n\nOutside, things were no better; the very tram-conductors were\nfascinated by it; and every passer-by was a fresh object of dread:\nLaura waited, her heart a-thump, for the moment when he should raise\nhis eyes and, with a start of attention, become aware of the screaming\ncolour. At Godmother's all the faces disapproved: Georgina said, \"What\na guy!\" when she thought Laura was out of earshot; but the boys stated\ntheir opinion openly as soon as they had her to themselves.\n\n\"Oh, golly! Like a parrot--ain't she?\"\n\n\"This way to the purple parrot--this way! Step up, ladies and\ngentlemen! A penny the whole show!\"\n\nThat evening, she tore the dress from her back and, hanging it up\ninside the cloak, vowed that, come what might, she would never put it\non again. A day or two later, on unexpectedly entering her bedroom, she\nfound Lilith Gordon and another girl at her wardrobe. They grew very\nred, and hurried giggling from the room, but Laura had seen what they\nwere looking at. After this, she tied the dress up with string and\nbrown paper and hid it in a drawer, under her nightgowns. When she went\nhome at Christmas it went with her, still in the parcel, and then there\nwas a stormy scene. But Laura was stubborn: rather than wear the dress,\nshe would not go back to the College at all. Mother's heart had been\nsoftened by the prizes; Laura seized the occasion, and extracted a\npromise that she should be allowed in future to choose her own\nfrocks.-- And so the purple dress was passed on to Pin, who detested it\nwith equal heartiness, but, living under Mother's eye, had not the\nspirit to fight against it.\n\n\"Got anything new in the way of clothes?\" asked Lilith Gordon as she\nand Laura undressed for bed a night or two after their return.\n\n\"Yes, one,\" said Laura shortly.--For she thought Lilith winked at the\nthird girl, a publican's daughter from Clunes.\n\n\"Another like the last? Or have you gone in for yellow ochre this time?\"\n\nLaura flamed in silence.\n\n\"Great Scott, what a colour that was! Fit for an Easter Fair--Miss Day\nsaid so.\"\n\n\"It wasn't mine,\" retorted Laura passionately. \"It ... it belonged to a\ngirl I knew who died--and her mother gave it to me as a remembrance of\nher--but I didn't care for it.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't think you did.--But I say, does your mother let you wear\nother people's clothes? What a rummy thing to do!\"\n\nShe went out of the room--no doubt to spread this piece of gossip\nfurther. Laura looked daggers after her. She was angry enough with\nLilith for having goaded her to the lie, but much angrier with herself\nfor its blundering ineffectualness. It was not likely she had been\nbelieved, and if she were, well, it made matters worse instead of\nbetter: people would conclude that she lived on charity. Always when\nunexpectedly required to stand on the defensive, she said or did\nsomething foolish. That morning, for instance, a similar thing had\nhappened--it had rankled all day in her mind. On looking through the\nwashing, Miss Day had exclaimed in horror at the way in which her\nstockings were mended.\n\n\"Whoever did it? They've been done since you left here. I would never\nhave passed such dams.\"\n\nLaura crimsoned. \"Those? Oh, an old nurse we've got at home. We've had\nher for years and years--but her eyesight's going now.\"\n\nMiss Day sniffed audibly. \"So I should think. To cobble like that!\"\n\nThey were Mother's dams, hastily made, late at night, and with all\nMother's genial impatience at useful sewing as opposed to beautiful.\nLaura's intention had been to shield Mother from criticism, as well as\nto spare Miss Day's feelings. But to have done it so clumsily as this!\nTo have had to wince under Miss Day's scepticism! It was only a wonder\nthe governess had not there and then taxed her with the fib. For who\nbelieved in old nurses nowadays? They were a stock property, borrowed\non the spur of the moment from readings in THE FAMILY HERALD, from\nTennyson's LADY CLARE. Why on earth had such a far-fetched excuse leapt\nto her tongue? Why could she not have said Sarah, the servant, the\nmaid-of-all-work? Then Miss Day would have had no chance to sniff, and\nshe, Laura, could have believed herself believed, instead of having to\nfret over her own stupidity.--But what she would like more than\nanything to know was, why the mending of the stockings at home should\nNOT be Sarah's work? Why must it just be Mother--her mother alone--who\nmade herself so disagreeably conspicuous, and not merely by darning the\nstockings, but, what was a still greater grievance, by not even darning\nthem well?\n\n\n\n\nXI.\n\n\nIt was an odd thing, all the same, how easy it was to be friends with\nLilith Gordon: though she did not belong to Laura's set though Laura\ndid not even like her, and though she had had ample proof that Lilith\nwas double-faced, not to be trusted. Yet, in the months that followed\nthe affair of the purple dress, Laura grew more intimate with the\nplump, sandy-haired girl than with either Bertha, or Inez, or Tilly.\nOr, to put it more exactly, she was continually having lapses into\nintimacy, and repenting them when it was too late. In one way Lilith\nwas responsible for this: she could make herself very pleasant when she\nchose, seem to be your friend through thick and thin, thus luring you\non to unbosom yourself; and afterwards she would go away and laugh over\nwhat you had told her, with other girls. And Laura was peculiarly\nhelpless under such circumstances: if it was done with tact, and with a\ncertain assumed warmth of manner, anyone could make a cat's-paw of her.\n\nThat Lilith and she undressed for bed together had also something to do\nwith their intimacy: this half-hour when one's hair was unbound and\nreplaited, and fat and thin arms wielded the brush, was the time of all\nothers for confidences. The governess who occupied the fourth bed did\nnot come upstairs till ten o'clock; the publican's daughter, a lazy\ngirl, was usually half asleep before the other two had their clothes\noff.\n\nIt was in the course of one of these confidential chats that Laura did\na very foolish thing. In a moment of weakness, she gratuitously gave\naway the secret that Mother supported her family by the work of her\nhands.\n\nThe two girls were sitting on the side of Lilith's bed. Laura had a day\nof mishaps behind her--that partly, no doubt, accounted for her\nself-indulgence. But, in addition, her companion had just told her,\nunasked, that she thought her \"very pretty\". It was not in Laura's\nnature to let this pass: she was never at ease under an obligation; she\nhad to pay the coin back in kind.\n\n\"Embroidery? What sort? However does she do it?\"--Lilith's interest was\non tiptoe at once--a false and slimy interest, the victim afterwards\ntold herself.\n\n\"Oh, my mother's awfully clever. It's just lovely, too, what she\ndoes--all in silk--and ever so many different colours. She made a\npiano-cover once, and got fifty pounds for it.\"\n\n\"How perfectly splendid!\"\n\n\"But that was only a lucky chance ... that she got that to do. She\nmostly does children's dresses and cloaks and things like that.\"\n\n\"But she's not a dressmaker, is she?\"\n\n\"A dressmaker? I should think not indeed! They're sent up, all ready to\nwork, from the biggest shops in town.\"\n\n\"I say!--she must be clever.\"\n\n\"She is; she can do anything. She makes the patterns up all out of her\nown head. \"--And filled with pride in Mother's accomplishments and\nLilith's appreciation of them, Laura fell asleep that night without a\nqualm.\n\nIt was the next evening. Several of the boarders who had finished\npreparing their lessons were loitering in the dining-hall, Laura and\nLilith among them. In the group was a girl called Lucy, young but very\nsaucy; for she lived at Toorak, and came of one of the best families in\nMelbourne. She was not as old as Laura by two years, but was already\nfeared and respected for the fine scorn of her opinions.\n\nLilith Gordon had bragged: \"My uncle's promised me a gold watch and\nchain when I pass matric.\"\n\nLucy of Toorak laughed: her nose came down, and her mouth went up at\nthe corners. \"Do you think you ever will?\"\n\n\"G. o. k. and He won't tell. But I'll probably get the watch all the\nsame.\"\n\n\"Where does your uncle hang out?\"\n\n\"Brisbane.\"\n\n\"Sure he can afford to buy it?\"\n\n\"Of course he can.\"\n\n\"What is he?\"\n\nLilith was unlucky enough to hesitate, ever so slightly. \"Oh, he's got\nplenty of money,\" she asserted.\n\n\"She doesn't like to say what he is!\"\n\n\"I don't care whether I say it or not.\"\n\n\"A butcher, p'raps, or an undertaker?\"\n\n\"A butcher! He's got the biggest newspaper in Brisbane!\"\n\n\"A newspaper! Great Scott! Her uncle keeps a newspaper!\"\n\nThere was a burst of laughter from those standing round.\n\nLilith was scarlet now. \"It's nothing to be ashamed of,\" she said\nangrily.\n\nBut Lucy of Toorak could not recover from her amusement. \"An uncle who\nkeeps a newspaper! A newspaper! Well, I'm glad none of MY uncles are so\nrummy.--I say, does he leave it at front doors himself in the morning?\"\n\nLaura had at first looked passively on, well pleased to see another\nthan herself the butt of young Lucy's wit. But at this stage of her\nexistence she was too intent on currying favour, to side with any but\nthe stronger party. And so she joined in the boisterous mirth Lilith's\nadmission and Lucy's reception of it excited, and flung her gibes with\nthe rest.\n\nShe was pulled up short by a hissing in her ear. \"If you say one word\nmore, I'll tell about the embroidery!\"\n\nLaura went pale with fright: she had been in good spirits that day, and\nhad quite forgotten her silly confidence of the night before. Now, the\njeer that was on the tip of her tongue hung fire. She could not all at\nonce obliterate her smile--that would have been noticeable; but it grew\nweaker, stiffer and more unnatural, then gradually faded away, leaving\nher with a very solemn little face.\n\nFrom this night on, Lilith Gordon represented a powder-mine, which\nmight explode at any minute.--And she herself had laid the train!\n\nFrom the outset, Laura had been accepted, socially, by even the most\nexclusive, as one of themselves; and this, in spite of her niggardly\nallowance, her ridiculous clothes. For the child had race in her: in a\nwell-set head, in good hands and feet and ears. Her nose, too, had a\nvery pronounced droop, which could stand only for blue blood, or a\nHebraic ancestor--and Jews were not received as boarders in the school.\nNow, loud as money made itself in this young community, effectual as it\nwas in cloaking shortcomings, it did not go all the way: inherited\ninstincts and traditions were not so easily subdued. Just some of the\nwealthiest, too, were aware that their antecedents would not stand a\nclose scrutiny; and thus a mighty respect was engendered in them for\nthose who had nothing to fear. Moreover, directly you got away from the\nvastly rich, class distinctions were observed with an exactitude such\nas can only obtain in an exceedingly mixed society. The three\nprofessions alone were sacrosanct. The calling of architect, for\nexample, or of civil engineer, was, if a fortune had not been\naccumulated, utterly without prestige; trade, any connection with\ntrade--the merest bowing acquaintance with buying and selling--was a\ntaint that nothing could remove; and those girls who were related to\nshopkeepers, or, more awful still, to publicans, would rather have\nbitten their tongues off than have owned to the disgrace.\n\nYet Laura knew very well that good birth and an aristocratic appearance\nwould not avail her, did the damaging fact leak out that Mother worked\nfor her living. Work in itself was bad enough--how greatly to be envied\nwere those whose fathers did nothing more active than live on their\nmoney! But the additional circumstance of Mother being a woman made\nthings ten times worse: ladies did not work; some one always left them\nenough to live on, and if he didn't, well, then he, too, shared the\nignominy. So Laura went in fear and trembling lest the truth should\ncome to light--in that case, she would be a pariah indeed--went in\nhourly dread of Lilith betraying her. Nothing, however, happened--at\nleast as far as she could discover--and she sought to propitiate Lilith\nin every possible way. For the time being, though, anxiety turned her\ninto a porcupine, ready to erect her quills at a touch. She was ever on\nthe look-out for an allusion to her mother's position, and for the\nslight that was bound to accompany it.\n\nEven the governesses noticed the change in her.\n\nThree of them sat one evening round the fire in Mrs. Gurley's\nsitting-room, with their feet on the fender. The girls had gone to bed;\nit was Mrs. Gurley's night off, and as Miss Day was also on leave, the\nthree who were left could draw in more closely than usual. Miss\nSnodgrass had made the bread into toast--in spite of Miss Chapman's\nquakings lest Mrs. Gurley should notice the smell when she came\nin--and, as they munched, Miss Snodgrass related how she had just\nconfiscated a book Laura Rambotham was trying to smuggle upstairs, and\nhow it had turned out that it belonged, not to Laura herself, but to\nLilith Gordon.\n\n\"She was like a little spitfire about it all the same. A most\nobjectionable child, I call her. It was only yesterday I wanted to look\nat some embroidery on her apron--a rather pretty new stitch--and do you\nthink she'd let me see it? She jerked it away and glared at me as if\nshe would have liked to eat me. I could have boxed her ears.\"\n\n\"I never have any trouble with Laura. I don't think you know how to\nmanage her,\" said Miss Chapman, and executed a little manoeuvre. She\nhad poor teeth; and, having awaited a moment when Miss Snodgrass's\nsharp eyes were elsewhere engaged, she surreptitiously dropped the\ncrusts of the toast into her handkerchief.\n\n\"I'd be sorry to treat her as you do,\" said Miss Snodgrass, and yawned.\n\"Girls need to be made to sit up nowadays.\"\n\nShe yawned again, and gazing round the room for fresh food for talk,\ncaught Miss Zielinski with her eye. \"Hullo, Ziely, what are you deep\nin?\" She put her arm round the other's neck, and unceremoniously laid\nhold of her book. \"You naughty girl, you're at Ouida again! Always got\nyour nose stuck in some trashy novel.\"\n\n\"DO let me alone,\" said Miss Zielinski pettishly, holding fast to the\nbook; but she did not raise her eyes, for they were wet.\n\n\"You know you'll count the washing all wrong again to-morrow, your\nhead'll be so full of that stuff.\"\n\n\"Yes, it's time to go, girls; to-morrow's Saturday.\" And Miss Chapman\nsighed; for, on a Saturday morning between six and eight o'clock,\nfifty-five lots of washing had to be sorted out and arranged in piles.\n\n\"Holy Moses, what a life!\" ejaculated Miss Snodgrass, and yawned again,\nin a kind of furious desperation. \"I swear I'll marry the first man\nthat asks me, to get away from it.--As long as he has money enough to\nkeep me decently.\"\n\n\"You would soon wish yourself back, if you had no more feeling for him\nthat that,\" reproved Miss Chapman.\n\n\"Catch me! Not even if he had a hump, or kept a mistress, or was over\neighty. Oh dear, oh dear!\"--she stretched herself so violently that her\nbones cracked; to resume, in a tone of ordinary conversation: \"I do\nwish I knew whether to put a brown wing or a green one in that blessed\nhat of mine.\"\n\nMiss Chapman's face straightened out from its shocked expression. \"Your\nhat? Why do you want to change it? It's very nice as it is.\"\n\n\"My dear Miss Chapman, it's at least six months out of date.--Ziely,\nyou're crying!\"\n\n\"I'm not,\" said Miss Zielinski weakly, caught in the act of blowing her\nnose.\n\n\"How on earth can you cry over a book? As if it were true!\"\n\n\"I thank God I haven't such a cold heart as you.\"\n\n\"And I thank God I'm not a romantic idiot. But your name's not Thekla\nfor nothing I suppose.\"\n\n\"My name's as good as yours. And I won't be looked down on because my\nfather was once a German.\"\n\n\"'Mr. Kayser, do you vant to buy a dawg?'\" hummed Miss Snodgrass.\n\n\"Girls, girls!\" admonished Miss Chapman. \"How you two do bicker.--\nThere, that's Mrs. Gurley now! And it's long past ten.\"\n\nAt the creaking of the front door both juniors rose, gathered their\nbelongings together, and hurried from the room. But it was a false\nalarm; and having picked up some crumbs and set the chairs in order,\nMiss Chapman resumed her seat. As she waited, she looked about her and\nwondered, with a sigh, whether it would ever be her good fortune to\ncall this cheery little room her own. It was only at moments like the\npresent that she could indulge such a dream. Did Mrs. Gurley stand\nbefore her, majestic in bonnet and mantle, as in a minute or two she\nwould, or draped in her great shawl, thoughts of this kind sank to\ntheir proper level, and Miss Chapman knew them for what they were\nworth. But sitting alone by night, her chin in her hand, her eyes on\nthe dying fire, around her the eerie stillness of the great house, her\nambition did not seem wholly out of reach; and, giving rein to her\nfancy, she could picture herself sweeping through halls and rooms,\nissuing orders that it was the business of others to fulfil, could even\nthink out a few changes that should be made, were she head of the staff.\n\nBut the insertion of Mrs. Gurley's key in the lock, the sound of her\nfoot on the oilcloth, was enough to waken a sense of guilt in Miss\nChapman, and make her start to her feet--the drab, elderly, apologetic\ngoverness once more.\n\n\n\n\nXII.\n\n\nDA REGIERT DER NACHBAR, DA WIRD MAN NACHBAR.\n\nNIETZSCHE\n\n\nYou might regulate your outward habit to the last button of what you\nwere expected to wear; you might conceal the tiny flaws and shuffle\nover the big improprieties in your home life, which were likely to\ndamage your value in the eyes of your companions; you might, in brief,\nmarch in the strictest order along the narrow road laid down for you by\nthese young lawgivers, keeping perfect step and time with them: yet of\nwhat use were all your pains, if you could not marshal your thoughts\nand feelings--the very realest part of you--in rank and file as well?\n... if these persisted in escaping control?--Such was the question\nwhich, about this time, began to present itself to Laura's mind.\n\nIt first took form on the day Miss Blount, the secretary, popped her\nhead in at the door and announced: \"At half-past three, Class Two to\nNumber One.\"\n\nClass Two was taking a lesson in elocution: that is to say Mr. Repton,\nthe visiting-master for this branch of study, was reading aloud, in a\nsonorous voice, a chapter of HANDY ANDY. He underlined his points\nheavily, and his hearers, like the self-conscious, emotionally shy\nyoung colonials they were, felt half amused by, half-superior to the\nhistrionic display. They lounged in easy, ungraceful postures while he\nread, reclining one against another, or sprawling forward over the\ndesks, their heads on their arms. It was the first hour after dinner,\nwhen one's thoughts were sleepy and stupid, and Mr. Repton was not a\npattern disciplinarian; but the general abandonment of attitude had\nanother ground as well. It had to do with the shape of the master's\nlegs. These were the object of an enthusiastic admiration. They were\ngenerally admitted to be the handsomest in the school, and those girls\nwere thought lucky who could get the best view of them beneath the\ndesk. Moreover, the rumour ran that Mr. Repton had once been an\nactor--his very curly hair no doubt lent weight to the report--and\nClass Two was fond of picturing the comely limbs in the tights of a\nHamlet or Othello. It also, of course, invented for him a lurid life\noutside the College walls--notwithstanding the fact that he and his\nsonsy wife sat opposite the boarders in church every Sunday morning,\nthe embodiment of the virtuous commonplace; and whenever he looked at a\npupil, every time he singled one of them out for special notice, he was\nbelieved to have an ulterior motive, his words were construed into\nmeaning something they should not mean: so that the poor man was often\ngenuinely puzzled by the reception of his friendly overtures.--Such was\nClass Two's youthful contribution to the romance of school life.\n\nOn this particular day, however, the sudden, short snap of the\nsecretary's announcement that, instead of dispersing at half-past\nthree, the entire school was to reassemble, galvanised the class.\nGlances of mingled apprehension and excitement flew round; eyes\ntelegraphed [P.119] vigorous messages; and there was little attention\nleft for well-shaped members, or for the antics of Handy Andy under his\nmother's bed.\n\nBut when the hour came, and all classes were moving in the same\ndirection, verandahs and corridors one seething mass of girls, it was\nthe excitement that prevailed. For any break was welcome in the\nuniformity of the days; and the nervous tension now felt was no more\ndisagreeable, at bottom, than was the pleasant trepidation experienced\nof old by those who went to be present at a hanging.\n\nIn the course of the past weeks a number of petty thefts had been\ncommitted. Day-scholars who left small sums of money in their jacket\npockets would find, on returning to the cloakrooms, that these had been\npilfered. For a time, the losses were borne in silence, because of the\nreluctance inherent in young girls to making a fuss. But when shillings\nbegan to vanish in the same fashion, and once even half-a-crown was\nmissing, it was recognised that the thing must be put a stop to; and\none bolder than the rest, and with a stronger sense of public morality,\nlodged a complaint. Investigations were made, a trap was set, and the\nthief discovered.--The school was now assembled to see justice done.\n\nThe great room was fuller even than at morning prayers; for then there\nwas always an unpunctual minority. A crowd of girls who had not been\nable to find seats was massed together at the further end. As at\nprayers, visiting and resident teachers stood in a line, with their\nbacks to the high windows; they were ranged in order of precedence,\ntopped by Dr Pughson, who stood next Mr. Strachey's desk. All [P.120]\nalike wore blank, stern faces.\n\nIn one of the rows of desks for two--blackened, ink-scored, dusty\ndesks, with eternally dry ink-wells--sat Laura and Tilly, behind them\nInez and Bertha. The cheeks of the four were flushed. But, while the\nothers only whispered and wondered, Laura was on the tiptoe of\nexpectation. She could not get her breath properly, and her hands and\nfeet were cold. Twisting her fingers, in and out, she moistened her\nlips with her tongue.--When, oh, when would it begin?\n\nThese few foregoing minutes were the most trying of any. For when, in\nan ominous hush, Mr. Strachey entered and strode to his desk, Laura\nsuddenly grew calm, and could take note of everything that passed.\n\nThe Principal raised his hand, to enjoin a silence that was already\nabsolute.\n\n\"Will Miss Johns stand up!\"\n\nAt these words, spoken in a low, impressive tone, Bertha burst into\ntears and hid her face in her handkerchief. Hundreds of eyes sought the\nunhappy culprit as she rose, then to be cast down and remain glued to\nthe floor.\n\nThe girl stood, pale and silly-looking, and stared at Mr. Strachey much\nas a rabbit stares at the snake that is about to eat it. She was a very\nugly girl of fourteen, with a pasty face, and lank hair that dangled to\nher shoulders. Her mouth had fallen half open through fear, and she did\nnot shut it all the time she was on view.\n\nLaura could not take her eyes off the scene: they travelled, burning\nwith curiosity, from Annie Johns to Mr. Strachey, and back again to the\nmiserable thief. When, after a few introductory remarks on crime in\ngeneral, the Principal passed on to the present case, and described it\nin detail, Laura was fascinated by his oratory, and gazed full at him.\nHe made it all live vividly before her; she hung on his lips,\nappreciating his points, the skilful way in which he worked up his\nclimaxes. But then, she herself knew what it was to be poor--as Annie\nJohns had been. She understood what it would mean to lack your\ntram-fare on a rainy morning--according to Mr. Strachey this was the\nmotor impulse of the thefts--because a lolly shop had stretched out its\noctopus arms after you. She could imagine, too, with a shiver, how easy\nit would be, the loss of the first pennies having remained\nundiscovered, to go on to threepenny-bits, and from these to sixpences.\nMore particularly since the money had been taken, without exception,\nfrom pockets in which there was plenty. Not, Laura felt sure, in order\nto avoid detection, as Mr. Strachey supposed, but because to those who\nhad so much a few odd coins could not matter. She wondered if everyone\nelse agreed with him on this point. How did the teachers feel about\nit?--and she ran her eyes over the row, to learn their opinions from\ntheir faces. But these were as stolid as ever. Only good old Chapman,\nshe thought, looked a little sorry, and Miss Zielinski--yes, Miss\nZielinski was crying! This discovery thrilled Laura--just as, at the\nplay, the fact of one spectator being moved to tears intensifies his\nneighbour's enjoyment.--But when Mr. Strachey left the field of\npersonal narration and went on to the moral aspects of the affair,\nLaura ceased to be gripped by him, and turned anew to study the pale,\ndogged face [P.122] of the accused, though she had to crane her neck to\ndo it. Before such a stony mask as this, she was driven to imagine what\nmust be going on behind it; and, while thus engrossed, she felt her arm\nangrily tweaked. It was Tilly.\n\n\"You ARE a beast to stare like that!\"\n\n\"I'm not staring.\"\n\nShe turned her eyes away at once, more than half believing her own\nwords; and then, for some seconds, she tried to do what was expected of\nher: to feel a decent unconcern. At her back, Bertha's purry crying\nwent steadily on. What on earth did she cry for? She had certainly not\nheard a word Mr. Strachey said. Laura fidgeted in her seat, and stole a\nsideglance at Tilly's profile. She could not, really could not miss the\nlast scene of all, when, in masterly fashion, the Principal was\ngathering the threads together. And so, feeling rather like \"Peeping\nTom\", she cautiously raised her eyes again, and this time managed to\nuse them without turning her head.\n\nAll other eyes were still charitably lowered. Several girls were crying\nnow, but without a sound. And, as the last, awful moments drew near,\neven Bertha was hushed, and of all the odd hundreds of throats not one\ndared to cough. Laura's heart began to palpitate, for she felt the\napproach of the final climax, Mr. Strachey's periods growing ever\nslower and more massive.\n\nWhen, after a burst of eloquence which, the child felt, would not have\nshamed a Bishop, the Principal drew himself up to his full height, and,\nwith uplifted arm, thundered forth: \"Herewith, Miss Annie Johns, I\npublicly expel you from the school! Leave it, now, this moment, and\nnever darken its doors again!\"--when this happened, Laura was shot\nthrough by an ecstatic quiver, such as she had felt once only in her\nlife before; and that was when a beautiful, golden-haired Hamlet, who\nhad held a Ballarat theatre entranced for a whole evening, fell dead by\nLaertes' sword, to the rousing plaudits of the house. Breathing\nunevenly, she watched, lynx-eyed, every inch of Annie Johns' progress:\nwatched her pick up her books, edge out of her seat and sidle through\nthe rows of desks; watched her walk to the door with short jerky\nmovements, mount the two steps that led to it, fumble with the handle,\nturn it, and vanish from sight; and when it was all over, and there was\nnothing more to see, she fell back in her seat with an audible sigh.\n\nIt was too late after this for the winding of the snaky line about the\nstreets and parks of East Melbourne, which constituted the boarders'\ndaily exercise. They were despatched to stretch their legs in the\ngarden. Here, as they walked round lawns and tennis-courts, they\ndiscussed the main event of the afternoon, and were a little more\nvociferous than usual, in an attempt to shake off the remembrance of a\nvery unpleasant half-hour.\n\n\"I bet you Sandy rather enjoyed kicking up that shindy.\"\n\n\"DID you see Puggy's boots again? Girls, he MUST take twelves!\"\n\n\"And that old blubber of a Ziely's handkerchief! It was filthy. I told\nyou yesterday I was sure she never washed her neck.\"\n\nBertha, whose tears had dried as rapidly as sea-spray, gave Laura a dig\nin the ribs. \"What's up with you, old Tweedledum? You're as glum as a\nlubra.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not.\"\n\n\"It's my belief that Laura was sorry for that pig,\" threw in Tilly.\n\n\"Indeed I wasn't!\" said Laura indignantly.\n\n\"Sorry for a thief?\"\n\n\"I tell you I WASN'T!\"--and this was true. Among the divers feelings\nLaura had experienced that afternoon, pity had not been included.\n\n\"If you want to be chums with such a mangy beast, you'd better go to\nschool in a lock-up.\"\n\n\"I don't know what my father'd say, if he knew I'd been in the same\nclass as a pickpocket,\" said the daughter of a minister from Brisbane.\n\"I guess he wouldn't have let me stop here a week.\"\n\nLaura went one better. \"My mother wouldn't have let me stop a day.\"\n\nThose standing by laughed, and a girl from the Riverina said: \"Oh, no,\nof course not!\" in a tone that made Laura wince and regret her\nreadiness.\n\nBefore tea, she had to practise. The piano stood in an outside\nclassroom, where no one could hear whether she was diligent or idle,\nand she soon gave up playing and went to the window. Here, having\ndusted the gritty sill with her petticoat, she leaned her chin on her\ntwo palms and stared out into the sunbaked garden. It was empty now,\nand very still. The streets that lay behind the high palings were\ndeserted in the drowsy heat; the only sound to be heard was a gentle\ntinkling to vespers in the neighbouring Catholic Seminary. Leaning thus\non her elbows, and balancing herself first on her heels, then on her\ntoes, Laura went on, in desultory fashion, with the thoughts that had\nbeen set in motion during the afternoon. She wondered where Annie Johns\nwas now, and what she was doing; wondered how she had faced her mother,\nand what her father had said to her. All the rest of them had gone back\nat once to their everyday life; Annie Johns alone was cut adrift. What\nwould happen to her? Would she perhaps be turned out of the house? ...\ninto the streets?--and Laura had a lively vision of the guilty\ncreature, in rags and tatters, slinking along walls and sleeping under\nbridges, eternally moved on by a ruthless London policeman (her only\nknowledge of extreme destitution being derived from the woeful tale of\n\"Little Jo\").--And to think that the beginning of it all had been the\nwant of a trumpery tram-fare. How safe the other girls were! No wonder\nthey could allow themselves to feel shocked and outraged; none of THEM\nknew what it was not to have threepence in your pocket. While she,\nLaura ... Yes, and it must be this same incriminating acquaintance with\npoverty that made her feel differently about Annie Johns and what she\nhad done. For her feelings HAD been different--there was no denying\nthat. Did she now think back over the half-hour spent in Number One,\nand act honest Injun with herself, she had to admit that her\ncompanions' indignant and horrified aversion to the crime had not been\nhers, let alone their decent indifference towards the criminal. No, to\nbe candid, she had been deeply interested in the whole affair, had even\nmanaged to extract an unseemly amount of entertainment from it. And\nthat, of course, should not have been. It was partly Mr. Strachey's\nfault, for making it so dramatic; but none the less she genuinely\ndespised herself, for having such a queer inside.\n\n\"Pig--pig--pig!\" she muttered under her breath, and wrinkled her nose\nin a grimace.\n\nThe real reason of her pleasurable absorption was, she supposed, that\nshe had understood Annie Johns' motive better than anyone else. Well,\nshe had had no business to understand--that was the long and the short\nof it: nice-minded girls found such a thing impossible, and turned\nincuriously away. And her companions had been quick to recognise her\ndifference of attitude, or they would never have dared to accuse her of\nsympathy with the thief, or to doubt her chorusing assertion with a\nsneer. For them, the gap was not very wide between understanding and\ndoing likewise. And they were certainly right.--Oh! the last wish in\nthe world she had was to range herself on the side of the sinner; she\nlonged to see eye to eye with her comrades--if she had only known how\nto do it. For there was no saying where it might lead you, if you\npersisted in having odd and peculiar notions; you might even end by\nbeing wicked yourself. Let her take a lesson in time from Annie's fate.\nFor, beginning perhaps with ideas that were no more unlike those of her\nschoolfellows than were Laura's own, Annie was now a branded thief and\nan outcast.--And the child's feelings, as she stood at the window, were\nnot very far removed from prayer. Had they found words, they would have\ntaken the form of an entreaty that she might be preserved from having\nthoughts that were different from other people's; that she might be\nmade to feel as she ought to feel, in a proper, ladylike way--and\nespecially did she see a companion convicted of crime.\n\nBelow all this, in subconscious depths, a chord of fear seemed to have\nbeen struck in her as well--the fear of stony faces, drooped lids, and\nstretched, pointing fingers. For that night she started up, with a cry,\nfrom dreaming that not Annie Johns but she was being expelled; that an\narmy of spear-like first fingers was marching towards her, and that,\ntry as she would, she could not get her limp, heavy legs to bear her to\nthe schoolroom door.\n\nAnd this dream often returned.\n\n\n\n\nXIII.\n\n\nON her honourable promotion the following Christmas--she mounted two\nforms this time--Laura was a thin, middle-sized girl of thirteen, who\nstill did not look her age. The curls had vanished. In their place hung\na long, dark plait, which she bound by choice with a red ribbon.\n\nTilly was the only one of her intimates who skipped a class with her;\nhence she was thrown more exclusively than before on Tilly's\ncompanionship; for it was a melancholy fact: if you were not in the\nsame class as the girl who was your friend, your interests and hers\nwere soon fatally sundered. On their former companions, Tilly and\nLaura, from their new perch, could not but look down: the two had\nmasters now for all subjects; Euclid loomed large; Latin was no longer\nbounded by the First Principia; and they fussed considerably, in the\nothers' hearing, over the difficulties of the little blue books that\nbegan: GALLIA EST OMNIS DIVISA IN PARTES TRES.\n\nIn the beginning, they held very close together; for their new fellows\nwere inclined to stand on their dignity with the pair of interlopers\nfrom Class Two. They were all older than Tilly and Laura, and thought\nthemselves wiser: here were girls of sixteen and seventeen years of\nage, some of whom would progress no farther along the high-road of\neducation. As for the boarders who sat in this form, they made up a\njealous little clique, and it was some time before the younger couple\ncould discover the secret bond.\n\nThen, one morning, the two were sitting with a few others on the\nverandah bench, looking over their lessons for the day. Mrs. Gurley had\nsnatched a moment's rest there, on her way to the secretary's office,\nand as long as she allowed her withering eye to play upon things and\npeople, the girls conned their pages with a great show of industry. But\nno sooner had she sailed away than Kate Horner leant forward and called\nto Maria Morell, who was at the other end of the seat: \"I say, Maria,\nGenesis LI, 32.\"--She held an open Bible in her hand.\n\nMaria Morell frowned caution. \"Dash it, Kate, mind those kids!\"\n\n\"Oh, they won't savvy.\"\n\nBut Laura's eyes were saucers of curiosity, for Tilly, who kept her\nlong lashes lowered, had given her a furious nudge. With a wink and a\nbeck to each other, the bigger girls got up and went away.\n\n\"I say, what did you poke me so hard for?\" inquired Laura as she and\nTilly followed in their wake, at the clanging of the public prayer-bell.\n\n\"You soft, didn't you hear what she said?\"\n\n\"Of course I did\"--and Laura repeated the reference.\n\n\"Let's look it up then.\" Under cover of the prayer Tilly sought it out,\nand together they bent their heads over it.\n\nOn this occasion, Tilly was more knowing than Laura; but on this alone;\nfor when Laura once grasped what they were driving at, she was as\nnimble-witted as any.\n\nOnly a day or two later it was she who, in face of Kate and Maria,\ninvited Tilly to turn up chapter and verse.\n\nBoth the elder girls burst out laughing.\n\n\"By dad!\" cried Kate Horner, and smacked her thigh. \"This kid knows a\nthing or two.\"\n\n\"You bet! I told you she wasn't born yesterday.\"--And Maria laid her\narm round Laura's shoulders.\n\nThus was Laura encouraged, put on her mettle; and soon there was no\nmore audacious Bible-reader in the class than she.\n\nThe girls were thrown thus upon the Book of Books for their contraband\nknowledge, since it was the only frankly outspoken piece of literature\nallowed within the College walls: the classics studied were rigidly\nexpurgated; the school library was kept so dull that no one over the\nage of ten much cared to borrow a volume from it. And, by fair means or\nunfair, it was necessary to obtain information on matters of sex; for\ngirls most of whom were well across the threshold of womanhood the\nsubject had an invincible fascination.\n\nSuch knowledge as they possessed was a strange jumble, picked up at\nrandom: in one direction they were well primed; in another, supremely\nignorant. Thus, though they received lectures on what was called\n\"Physiology\", and for these were required to commit to memory the name\nof every bone and artery in the body, yet all that related to a woman's\nspecial organs and chief natural function was studiously ignored. The\nsubject being thus chastely shrouded in mystery, they were thrown back\non guesswork and speculation--with the quaintest results. The fancies\nwoven by quite big girls, for instance, round the physical feat of\nbringing a child into the world, would have supplied material for a\nvolume of fairytales. On many a summer evening at this time, in a nook\nof the garden, heads of all shades might have been seen pressed as\nclose together as a cluster of settled bees; and like the humming of\nbees, too, were the busy whisperings and subdued buzzes of laughter\nthat accompanied this hot discussion of the \"how\"--as a living answer\nto which, each of them would probably some day walk the world.\nInnumerable theories were afloat, one more fantastic than another; and\nthe wilder the conjecture, the greater was the respect and applause it\ngained.\n\nOn the other hand, of less profitable information they had amassed a\ngoodly store. Girls who came from up-country could tell a lively tale\nof the artless habits of the blacks; others, who were at home in mining\ntowns, described the doings in Chinese camps--those unavoidable\nconcomitants of gold-grubbing settlements; rhymes circulated that would\nhave staggered a back-blocker; while the governesses were without\nexception, young and old, kindly and unkindly, laid under such\nflamboyant suspicions as the poor ladies had, for certain, never heard\nbreathed--since their own impudent schooldays.\n\nThis dabbling in the illicit--it had little in common with the opener\ngrime of the ordinary schoolboy--did not even widen the outlook of\nthese girls. For it was something to hush up and keep hidden away, to\nhave qualms, even among themselves, about knowing; and, like all\nknowledge that fungus-like shrinks from the sun, it was stunted and\nunlovely. Their minds were warped by it, their vision was distorted:\nviewed through its lens, the most natural human relations appeared\nunnatural. Thus, not the primmest patterns of family life could hope\nfor mercy in their eyes; over the family, too, man, as read by these\nyoung rigorists, was held to leave his serpent's trail of desire.\n\nFor out of it all rose the vague, crude picture of woman as the prey of\nman. Man was animal, a composite of lust and cruelty, with no aim but\nthat of brutally taking his pleasure: something monstrous, yet to be\nadored; annihilating, yet to be sought after; something to flee and, at\nthe same time, to entice, with every art at one's disposal.\n\nAs long as it was solely a question of clandestine knowledge and\ningenious surmisings, Laura went merrily with the rest: here no barrier\nshut her off from her companions. Always a very inquisitive little\ngirl, she was now agog to learn new lore. Her mind, in this direction,\nwas like a clean but highly sensitised plate. And partly because of her\nprevious entire ignorance, partly because of her extreme receptiveness,\nshe soon outstripped her comrades, and before long, was one of the most\nskilful improvisers of the group: a dexterous theorist: a wicked little\nadept at innuendo.\n\nBut that was all; a step farther, and she ran her head against a stone\nwall. For the invisible yeast that brought this ferment of natural\ncuriosity to pass, was the girls' intense interest in the opposite sex:\na penned-up interest that clamoured for an outlet; an interest which,\nin the life of these prospective mothers, had already usurped the main\nplace. Laura, on the other hand, had so far had scant experience of\nboys of a desirable age, nor any liking for such as she had known;\nindeed she still held to her childish opinion that they were\n\"silly\"--feckless creatures, in spite of their greater strength and\nsize--or downright disagreeable and antagonistic, like Godmother's\nErwin and Marmaduke. No breath of their possible dangerous fascination\nhad hitherto reached her. Hence, an experience that came her way, at\nthe beginning of the autumn was of the nature of an awakening.\n\n\n\n\nXIV.\n\n\n\"My cousin Bob's awfully gone on you.\"\n\nLaura gaped at Tilly, in crimson disbelief. \"But I've never spoken to\nhim!\"\n\n\"Doesn't count. He's seen you in church.\"\n\n\"Go on!--you're stuffing.\"\n\n\"Word of honour!--And I've promised him to ask aunt if I can bring you\nwith me to lunch next Saturday.\"\n\nLaura looked forward to this day with mixed feelings. She was flattered\nat being invited to the big house in town where Tilly's relatives\nlived; but she felt embarrassed at the prospect, and she had not the\nleast idea what a boy who was \"gone\" on you would expect you to be or\nto do. Bob was a beautiful youth of seventeen, tall, and dark, and\nslender, with milk-white teeth and Spanish eyes; and Laura's mouth\ndried up when she thought of perhaps having to be sprightly or\ncoquettish with him.\n\nOn the eventful morning Tilly came to her room while she was dressing,\nand eyed her critically.\n\n\"Oh, I say, don't put on that brown hat ... for mercy's sake! Bob can't\nstand brown.\"\n\nBut the brown was Laura's best, and she demurred.\n\n\"Oh well, if you don't care to look nice, you know ...\"\n\nOf course she did; she was burning to. She even accepted the loan of a\nsash from her friend, because \"Bob loves blue\"; and went out feeling\nodd and unlike herself, in her everyday hat and borrowed plumes.\n\nThe Aunt, a pleasant, youthful-looking lady, called for them in a\nwhite-hooded wagonette, and set them down at the house with a playful\nwarning.\n\n\"Now don't get up to any mischief, you two!\"\n\n\"No fear!\" was Tilly's genial response, as Aunt and cab drove off.\n\nThey were going to \"do the block\", Tilly explained, and would meet Bob\nthere; but they must first make sure that the drive had not disarranged\ntheir hair or the position of their hats; and she led the way to her\naunt's bedroom.\n\nLaura, though she had her share of natural vanity, was too impatient to\ndo more than cast a perfunctory glance at her reflected self. At this\nperiod of her life when a drive in a hired cab was enough of a novelty\nto give her pleasure, a day such as the one that lay before her filled\nher with unbounded anticipation.\n\nShe fidgeted from one leg to another while she waited. For Tilly was in\nno hurry to be gone: she prinked and finicked, making lavish use, after\nthe little swing-glass at school, of the big mirror with its movable\nwings; she examined her teeth, pulled down her under-lids, combed her\neyebrows, twisted her neck this way and that, in an endeavour to view\nher person from every angle; she took liberties with perfumes and\nbrushes: was, in short, blind and deaf to all but the perfecting of\nherself--this rather mannish little self, which, despite a most womanly\nplumpness, affected a boyish bonhomie, and emphasised the role by\nwearing a stiff white collar and cuffs.\n\nLaura was glad when she at last decided that she would \"do\", and when\nthey stepped out into the radiant autumn morning.\n\n\"What a perfectly scrumptious day!\"\n\n\"Yes, bully.--I say, IS my waist all right?\"\n\n\"Quite right. And ever so small.\"\n\n\"I know. I gave it an extra pull-in.--Now if only we're lucky enough to\nget hold of a man or two we know!\"\n\nThe air, Australian air, met them like a prickling champagne: it was\nincredibly crisp, pure, buoyant. From the top of the eastern hill the\nspacious white street sloped speedily down, to run awhile in a hollow,\nthen mount again at the other end. Where the two girls turned into it,\nit was quiet; but the farther they descended, the fuller it\ngrew--fuller of idlers like themselves, out to see and to be seen.\n\nLaura cocked her chin; she had not had a like sense of freedom since\nbeing at school. And besides, was not a boy, a handsome boy, waiting\nfor her, and expecting her? This was the CLOU of the day, the end for\nwhich everything was making; yet of such stuff was Laura that she would\nhave felt relieved, could the present moment have been spun out\nindefinitely. The state of suspense was very pleasant to her.\n\nAs for Tilly, that young lady was swinging the shoulders atop of the\nlittle waist in a somewhat provocative fashion, only too conscious of\nthe grey-blueness of her fine eyes, and the modish cut of her clothes.\nShe had a knack which seemed to Laura both desirable and unattainable:\nthat of appearing to be engrossed in glib chat with her companion,\nwhile in reality she did not hear a word Laura said, and ogled everyone\nwho passed, out of the tail of her eye.\n\nThey reached the \"block\", that strip of Collins Street which forms the\nfashionable promenade. Here the road was full of cabs and carriages,\nand there was a great crowd on the pavement. The girls progressed but\nslowly. People were meeting their friends, shopping, changing books at\nthe library, eating ices at the confectioner's, fruit at the big\nfruit-shop round the corner. There were a large number of high-collared\nyoung dudes, some Trinity and Ormond men with coloured hatbands, ladies\nwith little parcels dangling from their wrists, and countless\nschoolgirls like themselves. Tilly grew momentarily livelier; her big\neyes pounced, hawk-like, on every face she met, and her words to Laura\nbecame more disjointed than before. Finally, her efforts were crowned\nwith success: she managed, by dint of glance and smile combined, to\nunhook a youth of her acquaintance from a group at a doorway, and to\nattach him to herself.\n\nIn high good humour now that her aim was accomplished, she set about\nthe real business of the morning--that of promenading up and down. She\nhad no longer even a feigned interest left for Laura, and the latter\nwalked beside the couple a lame and unnecessary third. Though she kept\na keen watch for Bob, she could not discover him, and her time was\nspent for the most part in dodging people, and in catching up with her\ncompanions for it was difficult to walk three abreast in the crowd.\n\nThen she saw him--and with what an unpleasant shock. If only Tilly did\nnot see him, too!\n\nBut no such luck was hers. \"Look out, there's Bob,\" nudged Tilly almost\nat once.\n\nAlas! there was no question of his waiting longingly for her to appear.\nHe was walking with two ladies, and laughing and talking. He raised his\nhat to his cousin and her friend, but did not disengage himself, and\npassing them by disappeared in the throng.\n\nBehind her hand Tilly buzzed: \"One of those Woodwards is awfully sweet\non him. I bet he can't get loose.\"\n\nThis was a drop of comfort. But as, at the next encounter, he still did\nnot offer to join them--could it, indeed, be expected that he would\nprefer her company to that of the pretty, grown-up girls he was\nwith?--as he again sidled past, Tilly, who had given him one of her\nmost vivacious sparkles, turned and shot a glance at Laura's face.\n\n\"For pity's sake, look a little more amiable, or he won't come at all.\"\n\nLaura felt more like crying; her sunshine was intercepted, her good\nspirits were quenched; had she had her will, she would have turned tail\nand gone straight back to school. She had not wanted Bob, had never\nasked him to be 'gone' on her, and if she had now to fish for him, into\nthe bargain...However there was no help for it; the thing had to be\ngone through with; and, since Tilly seemed disposed to lay the blame of\nhis lukewarmness at her door, Laura glued her mouth, the next time Bob\nhove in sight, into a feeble smile.\n\nSoon afterwards he came up to them. His cousin had an arch greeting in\nreadiness.\n\n\"Well, you've been doing a pretty mash, you have!\" she cried, and\njogged him with her elbow. \"No wonder you'd no eyes for poor us. What\nprice Miss Woodward's gloves this morning!\"--at which Bob laughed,\nlooked sly, and tapped his breast pocket.\n\nIt was time to be moving homewards. Tilly and her beau led the way.\n\"For we know you two would rather be alone. Now, Bob, not too many\nsheep's-eyes, please!\"\n\nBob smiled, and let fly a wicked glance at Laura from under his dark\nlashes. Dropping behind, they began to mount the hill. Now was the\nmoment, felt Laura, to say something very witty, or pert, or clever;\nand a little pulse in her throat beat hard, as she furiously racked her\nbrains. Oh, for just a morsel of Tilly's loose-tonguedness! One after\nthe other she considered and dismissed: the pleasant coolness of the\nmorning, the crowded condition of the street, even the fact of the next\nday being Sunday--ears and cheeks on fire, meanwhile, at her own\nslow-wittedness. And Bob smiled. She almost hated him for that smile.\nIt was so assured, and withal so disturbing. Seen close at hand his\nteeth were whiter, his eyes browner than she had believed. His upper\nlip, too, was quite dark; and he fingered it incessantly, as he waited\nfor her to make the onslaught.\n\nBut he waited in vain; and when they had walked a whole street-block in\nthis mute fashion, it was he who broke the silence.\n\n\"Ripping girls, those Woodwards,\" he said, and seemed to be remembering\ntheir charms.\n\n\"Yes, they looked very nice,\" said Laura in a small voice, and was\nextremely conscious of her own thirteen years.\n\n\"Simply stunning! Though May's so slender--May's the pretty one--and\nhas such a jolly figure ... I believe I could span her waist with my\ntwo hands ... her service is just A1--at tennis I mean.\"\n\n\"Is it really?\" said Laura wanly, and felt unutterably depressed at the\nturn the conversation was taking.--Her own waist was coarse, her\nknowledge of tennis of the slightest.\n\n\"Ra-THER! Overhand, with a cut on it--she plays with a 14-oz. racquet.\nAnd she has a back drive, too, by Jove, that--you play, of course?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\" Laura spoke up manfully; but prayed that he would not press\nhis inquiries further. At this juncture his attention was diverted by\nthe passing of a fine tandem; and as soon as he brought it back to her\nagain, she said: 'You're at Trinity, aren't you?'--which was finesse;\nfor she knew he wasn't.\n\n\"Well, yes ... all but,\" answered Bob well pleased. \"I start in this\nwinter.\"\n\n\"How nice!\"\n\nThere was another pause; then she blurted out: \"We church girls always\nwear Trinity colours at the boat-race.\"\n\nShe hoped from her heart, this might lead him to say that he would look\nout for her there; but he did nothing of the kind. His answer was to\nthe effect that this year they jolly well expected to knock Ormond into\na cocked hat.\n\nLunch threatened to be formidable. To begin with, Laura, whose natural,\neasy frankness had by this time all but been successfully educated out\nof her, Laura was never shyer with strangers than at a meal, where\nevery word you said could be listened to by a tableful of people. Then,\ntoo, her vis-a-vis was a small sharp child of five or six, called\nThumbby, or Thumbkin, who only removed her bead-like eyes from Laura's\nface to be saucy to her father. And, what was worse, the Uncle turned\nout to be a type that struck instant terror into Laura: a full-fledged\nmale tease.--He was, besides, very hairy of face, and preternaturally\nsolemn.\n\nNo sooner had he drawn in his chair to the table than he began. Lifting\nhis head and thrusting out his chin, he sniffed the air in all\ndirections with a moving nose--just as a cat does. Everyone looked at\nhim in surprise. Tilly, who sat next him, went pink.\n\n\"What is it, dear?\" his wife at last inquired in a gentle voice; for it\nwas evident that he was not going to stop till asked why he did it.\n\n\"Mos' extraor'nary smell!\" he replied. \"Mother, d'you know, I could\ntake my appledavy some one has been using my scent.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Tom.\"\n\n\"Silly pa!\" said the little girl.\n\nRamming his knuckles into his eyes, he pretended to cry at his\ndaughter's rebuke; then bore down on Laura.\n\n\"D'you know, Miss Ra ... Ra ... Rambotham\"--he made as if he could not\nget her name out--\"d'you know that I'm a great man for scent? Fact. I\ntake a bath in it every morning.\"\n\nLaura smiled uncertainly, fixed always by the child.\n\n\"Fact, I assure you. Over the tummy, up to the chin.--Now, who's been\nat it? For it's my opinion I shan't have enough left to shampoo my\neyebrows.--Bob, is it you?\"\n\n\"Don't be an ass, pater.\"\n\n\"Cut me some bread, Bob, please,\" said Tilly hastily.\n\n\"Mos' extraor'nary thing!\" persisted the Uncle. \"Or--good Lord, mother,\ncan it be my monthly attack of D.T.'s beginning already? They're not\ndue, you know, till next week, Monday, five o'clock.\"\n\n\"Dear, DON'T be so silly. Besides it's my scent, not yours. And anyone\nis welcome to it.\"\n\n\"Well, well, let's call in the cats!--By the way, Miss Ra ... Ra ...\nRambotham, are you aware that this son of mine is a professed\nlady-killer?\"\n\nLaura and Bob went different shades of crimson.\n\n\"Why has she got so red?\" the child asked her mother, in an audible\nwhisper.\n\n\"Oh, CHUCK it, pater!\" murmured Bob in disgust.\n\n\"Fact, I assure you. Put not your trust in Robert! He's always on with\nthe new love before he's off with the old. You ask him whose glove he's\nstill cherishing in the pocket next his heart.\"\n\nBob pushed his plate from him and, for a moment, seemed about to leave\nthe table. Laura could not lift her eyes. Tilly chewed in angry silence.\n\nHere, however, the child made a diversion.\n\n\"You're a lady-kilda yourself, pa.\"\n\n\"Me, Thumbkin?--Mother, d'you hear that?--Then it's the whiskers,\nThumbby. Ladies love whiskers--or a fine drooping moustache, like my\nson Bob's.\" He sang: \"'Oh, oh, the ladies loved him so!'\"\n\n\"Tom, dear, DO be quiet.\"\n\n\"Tom, Tom, the piper's son!\" chirped Thumbby.\n\n\"Well, well, let's call in the cats!\"--which appeared to be his way of\nchanging the subject.\n\nIt seemed, after this, as though the remainder of lunch might pass off\nwithout further hitch. Then however and all of a sudden, while he was\npeeling an apple, this dreadful man said, as though to himself: \"Ra ...\nRa ... Rambotham. Now where have I heard that name?\"\n\n\"Wa ... Wa ... Wamboffam!\" mocked Thumbkin.\n\n\"Monkey, if you're so sharp you'll cut yourself!--Young lady, do you\nhappen to come from Warrenega?\" he asked Laura, when Thumbkin's excited\nchirrup of: \"I'll cut YOU, pa, into little bits!\" had died away.\n\nReady to sink through the floor, Laura replied that she did.\n\n\"Then I've the pleasure of knowing your mother.--Tall dark woman, isn't\nshe?\"\n\nUnder the table, Laura locked the palms of her hands and stemmed her\nfeet against the floor. Was here, now, before them all, and Bob in\nparticular, the shameful secret of the embroidery to come to light? She\ncould hardly force her lips to frame an answer.\n\nHer confusion was too patent to be overlooked. Above her lowered head,\nsigns passed between husband and wife, and soon afterwards the family\nrose from the table.\n\nBut Tilly was so obviously sulky that the tense could not let her\nescape him thus.\n\nHe cried: \"For God's sake, Tilly, stand still! What on earth have you\ngot on your back?\"\n\nTilly came from up-country and her thoughts leapt fearfully to\nscorpions and tarantulas. Affrighted, she tried to peer over her\nshoulder, and gave a preliminary shriek. \"Gracious!--whatever is it?\"\n\n\"Hold on!\" He approached her with the tongs; the next moment to\nejaculate: \"Begad, it's not a growth, it's a bustle!\" and as he spoke\nhe tweaked the place where a bustle used to be worn.\n\nEven Bob had to join in the ensuing boohoo, which went on and on till\nLaura thought the Uncle would fall down in a fit. Then for the third\ntime he invited those present to join him in summoning the cats,\nmurmured something about \"humping his bluey\", and went out into the\nhall, where they heard him swinging Thumbby \"round the world\".\n\nIt was all the Aunt could do to mollify Tilly, who was enraged to the\npoint of tears. \"I've never worn a bustle in my life! Uncle's a perfect\nFOOL! I've never met such a fool as he is!\"\n\nStill boiling, she disappeared to nurse her ruffled temper in private;\nand she remained absent from the room for over half an hour. During\nthis time Laura and Bob were alone together. But even less than before\ncame of their intercourse: Bob, still smarting from his father's\nbanter, was inclined to be stand-offish, as though afraid Laura might\ntake liberties with him after having been made to look so small; Laura,\nrendered thoroughly unsure to begin with, by the jocular tone of the\nluncheon-table, had not recovered from the shock of hearing her\nparentage so bluffly disclosed. And since, at this time, her idea of\nthe art of conversation was to make jerky little remarks which led\nnowhere, or to put still more jerky questions, Bob was soon stifling\nyawns, and not with the best success. He infected Laura; and there the\ntwo of them sat, doing their best to appear unconscious of the terrible\nspasms which, every few seconds, distorted their faces. At last Bob\ncould stand it no longer and bolted from the room.\n\nLaura was alone, and seemed to be forgotten The minutes ticked by, and\nno one came--or no one but a little grey kitten, which arrived as if\nfrom nowhere, with a hop and a skip. She coaxed the creature to her\nlap, where it joined head to tail and went to sleep. And there she sat,\nin the gloomy, overfilled drawing-room, and stroked the kitten, which\nneither cracked stupid jokes nor required her to strain her wits to\nmake conversation.\n\nWhen at length Tilly came back, she expressed a rather acid surprise at\nBob's absence, and went to look for him; Laura heard them whispering\nand laughing in the passage. On their return to the drawing-room it had\nbeen decided that the three of them should go for a walk. As the sky\nwas overcast and the girls had no umbrellas, Bob carried a big one\nbelonging to the Uncle. Tilly called this a \"family umbrella\"; and the\njokes that were extracted from the pair of words lasted the walkers on\nthe whole of their outward way; lasted so long that Laura, who was\nspeedily finished with her contribution, grew quite stupefied with\nlistening to the other two.\n\nCollins Street was now as empty as a bush road. The young people went\ninto Bourke Street, where, for want of something better to do, they\nentered the Eastern Market and strolled about inside. The noise that\nrose from the livestock, on ground floor and upper storey, was\near-splitting: pigs grunted; cocks crowed, turkeys gobbled, parrots\nshrieked; while rough human voices echoed and re-echoed under the lofty\nroof. There was a smell, too, an extraordinary smell, composed of all\nthe individual smells of all these living things: of fruit and\nvegetables, fresh and decayed; of flowers, and butter, and grain; of\nmeat, and fish, and strong cheeses; of sawdust sprinkled with water,\nand freshly wet pavements--one great complicated smell, the piquancy of\nwhich made Laura sniff like a spaniel. But after a very few minutes\nTilly, whose temper was still short, called it a \"vile stink\" and\nclapped her handkerchief to her nose, and so they hurried out, past\nmany enticing little side booths hidden in dark corners on the ground\nfloor, such as a woman without legs, a double-headed calf, and the like.\n\nOutside it had begun to rain; they turned into a Waxworks Exhibition.\nThis was a poor show, and they were merely killing time when the\nannouncement caught their eye that a certain room was open to \"Married\nPeople Only\". The quips and jokes this gave rise to again were as\nunending as those about the umbrella; and Laura grew so tired of them,\nand of pretending to find them funny, that her temper also began to\ngive way; and she eased her feelings by making the nippy mental note on\nher companions, that jokes were evidently \"in the blood\".\n\nWhen they emerged, it was time for the girls to return to school. They\ntook a hansom, Bob accompanying them. As they drove, Laura sitting\nsandwiched between the other two, it came over her with a rush what a\nmiserable failure the day had been. A minute before, her spirits had\ngiven a faint flicker, for Bob had laid his arm along the back of the\nseat. Then she saw that he had done this just to pull at the little\ncurls that grew on Tilly's neck. She was glad when the cab drew up,\nwhen Tilly ostentatiously took the fat half-crown from her purse, and\nBob left them at the gate with a: \"Well, so long, ladies!\"\n\nThe boarders spent the evening in sewing garments for charity. Laura\nhad been at work for weeks on a coarse, red flannel petticoat, and as a\nrule was under constant reprimand for her idleness. On this night,\nhaving separated herself from Tilly, she sat down beside a girl with a\nvery long plait of hair and small, narrow eyes, who went by the name of\n\"Chinky\". Chinky was always making up to her, and could be relied on to\ncover her silence. Laura sewed away, with bent head and pursed lips,\nand was so engrossed that the sole rebuke she incurred had to do with\nher diligence.\n\nMiss Chapman exclaimed in horror at her stiffly outstretched arm.\n\n\"How CAN you be so vulgar, Laura? To sew with a thread as long as that!\"\n\n\n\n\nXV.\n\n\nFor days Laura avoided even thinking of this unlucky visit. Privately,\nshe informed herself that Tilly's wealthy relations were a \"rude,\nstupid lot\"; and, stuffing her fingers in her ears, memorised pages\nwith a dispatch that deadened thought.\n\nWhen, however, the first smart had passed and she was able to go back\non what had happened, a soreness at her own failure was the abiding\nresult: and this, though Tilly mercifully spared her the \"dull as\nditchwater\", that was Bob's final verdict.--But the fact that the\ninvitation was not repeated told Laura enough.\n\nHer hurt was not relieved by the knowledge that she had done nothing to\ndeserve it. For she had never asked for Bob's notice or admiration, had\nnever thought of him but as a handsome cousin of Tilly's who sat in a\ndistant pew at St Stephen's-on-the-Hill; and the circumstance that,\nbecause he had singled her out approvingly, she was expected to worm\nherself into his favour, seemed to her of a monstrous injustice. But,\nall the same, had she possessed the power to captivate him, she would\ncheerfully have put her pride in her pocket. For, having once seen him\nclose at hand, she knew how desirable he was. Having been the object of\nglances from those liquid eyes, of smiles from those blanched-almond\nteeth, she found it hard to dismiss them from her mind. How the other\ngirls would have boasted of it, had they been chosen by such a one as\nBob!--they who, for the most part, were satisfied with blotchy-faced,\nred-handed youths, whose lean wrists dangled from their retreating\nsleeves. But then, too, they would have known how to keep him. Oh,\nthose lucky other girls!\n\n\"I say, Chinky, what do you do when a boy's gone on you?\"\n\nShe would have shrunk from putting an open question of this kind to her\nintimates; but Chinky, could be trusted. For she garnered the few words\nLaura vouchsafed her, as gratefully as Lazarus his crumbs; and a mark\nof confidence, such as this, would sustain her for days.\n\nBut she had no information to give.\n\n\"Me? ... why, nothing. Boys are dirty, horrid, conceited creatures.\"\n\nIn her heart Laura was at one with this judgment; but it was not to the\npoint.\n\n\"Yes, but s'pose one was awfully sweet on you and you rather liked him?\"\n\n\"Catch me! If one came bothering round me, I'd do this\" and she set her\nten outstretched fingers to her nose and waggled them.\n\nAnd yet Chinky was rather pretty, in her way.\n\nMaria Morell, cautiously tapped, threw back her head and roared with\nlaughter.\n\n\"Bless its little heart! Does it want to know?--say, Laura, who's your\nmash?\"\n\n\"No one,\" answered Laura stoutly. \"I only asked. For I guess you KNOW,\nMaria.\"\n\n\"By gosh, you bet I do!\" cried Maria, italicising the words in her\nvehemence. \"Well, look here, Kiddy, if a chap's sweet on me I let him\nbe sweet, my dear, and that's all--till he's run to barley-sugar. What\nI don't let him savvy is, whether I care a twopenny damn for him. Soon\nas you do that, it's all up. Just let him hang round, and throw\nsheep's-eyes, till he's as soft as a jellyfish, and when he's right\ndown ripe, roaring mad, go off and pretend to do a mash with some one\nelse. That's the way to glue him, chicken.\"\n\n\"But you don't have anything of him that way,\" objected Laura.\n\nMaria laughed herself red in the face. \"What'n earth more d'you want?\nWhy, he'll pester you with letters, world without end, and look as\nblack as your shoe if you so much as wink at another boy. As for a\nkiss, if he gets a chance of one he'll take it you can bet your bottom\ndollar on that.\"\n\n\"But you never get to know him!\"\n\n\"Oh, hang it, Laura, but you ARE rich! What d'you think one has a boy\nfor, I'd like to know. To parlezvous about old Shepherd's sermons? You\nloony, it's only for getting lollies, and letters, and the whole dashed\nfun of the thing. If you go about too much with one, you soon have to\nfake an interest in his rotten old affairs. Or else just hold your\ntongue and let him blow. And that's dull work. D'you think it ever\ncomes up a fellow's back to talk to you about your new Sunday hat! If\nit does, you can teach your grandmother to suck eggs.\"\n\nBut, despite this wisdom, Laura could not determine how Maria would\nhave acted had she stood in her shoes.\n\nAnd then, too, the elder girl had said nothing about another side of\nthe question, had not touched on the sighs and simpers, the winged\nglances, and drooped, provocative lids--all the thousand and one\nfooleries, in short, which Laura saw her and others employ. There was a\nregular machinery of invitation and encouragement to be set in motion:\nfor, before it was safe to ignore a wooer and let him dangle, as Maria\nadvised, you had first to make quite sure he wished to nibble your\nbait.--And it was just in this elementary science that Laura broke down.\n\nLooking round her, she saw mainly experts. To take the example nearest\nat hand: there was Monsieur Legros, the French master; well, Maria\ncould twist him round her little finger. She only needed to pout her\nthick, red lips, or to give a coquettish twist to her plump figure, or\nto ogle him with her fine, bold, blue eyes, and the difficult questions\nin the lesson were sure to pass her by.--Once she had even got ten\nextra marks added to an examination paper, in this easy fashion.\nWhereas, did she, Laura, try to imitate Maria, venture to pout or to\nsmirk, it was ten to one she would be rebuked for impertinence. No, she\ngot on best with the women-teachers, to whom red lips and a full bust\nmeant nothing; while the most elderly masters could not be relied on to\nbe wholly impartial, where a pair of magnificent eyes was concerned.\nEven Mr. Strachey, the unapproachable, had been known, on running full\ntilt into a pretty girl's arms in an unlit passage, to be laughingly\nconfused.\n\nLaura was not, of course, the sole outsider in these things; sprinkled\nthrough the College were various others, older, too, than she, who by\nreason of demureness of temperament, or immersion in their work, stood\naloof. But they were lost in the majority, and, as it chanced, none of\nthem belonged to Laura's circle. Except Chinky--and Chinky did not\ncount. So, half-fascinated, half-repelled, Laura set to studying her\nfriends with renewed zeal. She could not help admiring their\nproficiency in the art of pleasing, even though she felt a little\nabashed by the open pride they took in their growing charms. There was\nBertha, for instance, Bertha who had one of the nicest minds of them\nall; and yet how frankly gratified she was, by the visible rounding of\nher arms and the curving of her bust. She spoke of it to Laura with a\nkind of awe; and her voice seemed to give hints of a coming mystery.\nTilly, on the other hand, lived to reduce her waist-measure: she was\nalways sucking at lemons, and she put up with the pains of indigestion\nas well as a red tip to her nose; for no success in school meant as\nmuch to Tilly as the fact that she had managed to compress herself a\nfurther quarter of an inch, no praise on the part of her teachers\nequalled the compliments this earned her from dressmaker and tailor. As\nfor Inez, who had not only a pretty face but was graceful and\nslender-limbed as a greyhound, Inez no longer needed to worry over\nartificial charms, or to dwell self-consciously on her development;\nserious admirers were not lacking, and with one of these, a young man\nsome eight years older than herself, she had had for the past three\nmonths a sort of understanding. For her, as for so many others, the\ntime she had still to spend at school was as purgatory before paradise.\nTo top all, one of the day-scholars in Laura's class was actually\nengaged to be married; and in no boy-and-girl fashion, but to a doctor\nwho lived and practised in Emerald Hill: he might sometimes be seen,\nfrom a peephole under the stairs, waiting to escort her home from\nschool. This fiancee was looked up to by the class with tremendous\nreverence, as one set apart, oiled and anointed. You really could not\ntreat her as a comrade her, who had reached the goal. For this WAS the\ngoal; and the thoughts of all were fixed, with an intentness that\nvaried only in degree, on the great consummation which, as planned in\nthese young minds, should come to pass without fail directly the\ncollege-doors closed behind them.--And here again Laura was a heretic.\nFor she could not contemplate the future that was to be hers when she\nhad finished her education, but with a feeling of awe: it was still so\ndistant as to be one dense blue haze; it was so vast, that thinking of\nit took your breath away: there was room in it for the most wonderful\nmiracles that had ever happened; it might contain anything--from golden\nslippers to a Jacob's ladder, by means of which you would scale the\nskies; and with these marvellous perhapses awaiting you, it was\nimpossible to limit your hopes to one single event, which, though it\nsaved you from derision, would put an end, for ever, to all possible,\nexciting contingencies.\n\nThese thoughts came and went. In the meantime, despite her ape-like\nstudy of her companions, she remained where the other sex was concerned\na disheartening failure. A further incident drove this home anew.\n\nOne Saturday afternoon, those boarders who had not been invited out\nwere taken to see a cricket-match. They were a mere handful, eight or\nnine at most, and Miss Snodgrass alone was in charge. All her friends\n[P.154] being away that day, Laura had to bring up the rear with the\ngoverness and one of the little girls. Though their walk led them\nthrough pleasant parks, she was glad when it was over; for she did not\nenjoy Miss Snodgrass's company. She was no match for this crisply\nsarcastic governess, and had to be the whole time on her guard. For\nMiss Snodgrass was not only a great talker, but had also a very\ninquiring mind, and seemed always trying to ferret out just those\nthings you did not care to tell--such as the size of your home, or the\nsocial position you occupied in the township where you lived.\n\nArrived at the cricket ground, they climbed the Grand Stand and sat\ndown in one of the back rows, to the rear of the other spectators.\nBefore them sloped a steep bank of hats gaily-flowered and\nribbon-banded hats--of light and dark shoulders, of alert, boyish\nprofiles and pale, pretty faces--a representative gathering of young\nAustralia, bathed in the brilliant March light.\n\nLaura's seat was between her two companions, and it was here the\nmalheur occurred. During an interval in the game, one of the girls\nasked the governess's leave to speak to her cousin; and thereupon a shy\nlad was the target for twenty eyes. He was accompanied by a friend,\nwho, in waiting, sat down just behind Laura. This boy was addressed by\nMiss Snodgrass; but he answered awkwardly, and after a pause, Laura\nfelt herself nudged.\n\n\"You can speak to him, Laura,\" whispered Miss Snodgrass.--She evidently\nthought Laura waited only for permission, to burst in.\n\nLaura had already fancied that the boy looked at her with interest.\nThis was not improbable; for she had her best hat on, which made her\neyes seem very dark--\"like sloes,\" Chinky said, though neither of them\nhad any clear idea what a sloe was.\n\nStill, a prompting to speech invariably tied her tongue. She half\nturned, and stole an uneasy peep at the lad. He might be a year older\nthan herself; he had a frank, sunburnt face, blue eyes, and almost\nwhite flaxen hair. She took heart of grace.\n\n\"I s'pose you often come here?\" she ventured at last.\n\n\"You bet!\" said the boy; but kept his eyes where they were on the pitch.\n\n\"Cricket's a lovely game ... don't you think so?\"\n\nNow he looked at her; but doubtfully, from the height of his fourteen\nmale years; and did not reply.\n\n\"Do you play?\"\n\nThis was a false move, she felt it at once. Her question seemed to\noffend him. \"Should rather think I did!\" he answered with a haughty air.\n\nWeakly she hastened to retract her words. \"Oh, I meant much--if you\nplayed much?\"\n\n\"Comes to the same thing I guess,\" said the boy--he had not yet reached\nthe age of obligatory politeness.\n\n\"It must be splendid\"--here she faltered--\"fun.\"\n\nBut the boy's thoughts had wandered: he was making signs to a friend\ndown in the front of the Stand.--Miss Snodgrass seemed to repress a\nsmile.\n\nHere, however, the little girl at Laura's side chimed in. \"I think\ncricket's awful rot,\" she announced, in a cheepy voice.\n\nNow what was it, Laura asked herself, in these words, or in the tone in\nwhich they were said, that at once riveted the boy's attention. For he\nlaughed quite briskly as he asked; \"What's a kid like you know about\nit?\"\n\n\"Jus' as much as I want to. An' my sister says so 's well.\"\n\n\"Get along with you! Who's your sister?\"\n\n\"Ooh!--wouldn't you like to know? You've never seen her in Scots'\nChurch on Sundays I s'pose--oh, no!\"\n\n\"By jingo!--I should say I have. An' you, too. You're the little sister\nof that daisy with the simply ripping hair.\"\n\nThe little girl actually made a grimace at him, screwing up her nose.\n\"Yes, you can be civil now, can't you?\"\n\n\"My aunt, but she's a tip-topper--your sister!\"\n\n\"You go to Scots' Church then, do you?\" hazarded Laura, in an attempt\nto re-enter the conversation.\n\n\"Think I could have seen her if I didn't?\" retorted the boy, in the\ntone of: \"What a fool question!\" He also seemed to have been on the\npoint of adding: \"Goose,\" or \"Sillybones.\"\n\nThe little girl giggled. \"She's church\"--by which she meant\nepiscopalian.\n\n\"Yes, but I don't care a bit which I go to,\" Laura hastened to explain,\nfearful lest she should be accounted a snob by this dissenter. The boy,\nhowever, was so faintly interested in her theological wobblings that,\neven as she spoke, he had risen from his seat; and the next moment\nwithout another word he went away.--This time Miss Snodgrass laughed\noutright.\n\nLaura stared, with blurred eyes, at the white-clad forms that began to\ndot the green again. Her lids smarted. She did not dare to put up her\nfingers to squeeze the gathering tears away, and just as she was\nwondering what she should do if one was inconsiderate enough to roll\ndown her cheek, she heard a voice behind her.\n\n\"I say, Laura ... Laura!\"--and there was Chinky, in her best white hat.\n\n\"I'm sitting with my aunt just a few rows down; but I couldn't make you\nlook. Can I come in next to you for a minute?\"\n\n\"If you like,\" said Laura and, because she had to sniff a little, very\ncoldly: Chinky had no doubt also been a witness of her failure.\n\nThe girl squeezed past and shared her seat. \"I don't take up much room.\"\n\nLaura feigned to be engrossed in the game. But presently she felt her\nbare wrist touched, and Chinky said in her ear: \"What pretty hands\nyou've got, Laura!\"\n\nShe buried them in her dress, at this. She found it in the worst\npossible taste of Chinky to try to console her.\n\n\"Wouldn't you like to wear a ring on one of them?\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" said Laura, in the same repellent way.\n\n\"Truly? I'd love to give you one.\"\n\n\"You? Where would YOU get it?\"\n\n\"Would you wear it, if I did?\"\n\n\"Let me see it first,\" was Laura's graceless reply, as she returned to\nher stony contemplation of the great sunlit expanse.\n\nShe was sure Miss Snodgrass, on getting home, would laugh with the\nother governesses over what had occurred--if not with some of the\ngirls. The story would leak out and come to Tilly's ears; and Tilly\nwould despise her more than she did already. So would all the rest. She\nwas branded, as it was, for not having a single string to her bow. Now,\nit had become plain to her that she could never hope for one; for, when\nit came to holding a boy's attention for five brief minutes, she could\nbe put in the shade by a child of eight years old.\n\n\n\n\nXVI.\n\n\nSince, however, it seemed that some one had to be loved if you were to\nbe able to hold up your head with the rest, then it was easier,\ninfinitely easier, to love the curate. With the curate, no personal\ncontact was necessary--and that was more than could be said even of the\nmusic-masters. In regard to them, pressures of the hand, as well as\ncountless nothings, were expected and enacted, in the bi-weekly reports\nyou rendered to those of your friends who followed the case. Whereas\nfor the curate it was possible to simulate immense ardour, without\nneeding either to humble your pride or call invention to your aid: the\nworship took place from afar. The curate was, moreover, no unworthy\nobject; indeed he was quite attractive, in a lean, ascetic fashion,\nwith his spiritual blue eyes, and the plain gold cross that dangled\nfrom his black watch-ribbon--though, it must be admitted, when he\npreached, and grew greatly in earnest, his mouth had a way of opening\nas if it meant to swallow the church--and Laura was by no means his\nsole admirer. Several of her friends had a fancy for him, especially as\nhis wife, who was much older than he, was a thin, elderly lady with a\ntired face.\n\nAnd now, by her own experience, Laura was led to the following\ndiscovery: that, if you imagine a thing with sufficient force, you can\ninduce your imagining to become reality. By dint of pretending that it\nwas so, she gradually worked herself up into an attack of love, which\nwas genuine enough to make her redden when Mr. Shepherd was spoken of,\nand to enjoy being teased about him. And since, at any rate when in\nchurch, she was a sincerely religious little girl, and one to\nwhom--notwithstanding her protested indifference to forms of\nworship--such emotional accessories as flowers, and music, and highly\ncoloured vestments made a strong appeal, her feelings for Mr. Shepherd\nwere soon mystically jumbled up with her piety: the eastward slant for\nthe Creed, and the Salutation at the Sacred Name, seemed not alone\nhomage due to the Deity, but also a kind of minor homage offered to and\naccepted by Mr. Shepherd; the school-pew being so near the chancel that\nit was not difficult to believe yourself the recipient of personal\nnotice.\n\nAt home during the winter holidays, his name chanced to cross her lips.\nStraightway it occurred to Mother that he was the nephew of an old\nfriend whom she had long lost sight of letters passed between Warrenega\nand Melbourne, and shortly after her return to the College Laura learnt\nthat she was to spend the coming monthly holiday at Mr. Shepherd's\nhouse.\n\nIn the agitated frame of mind this threw her into, she did not know\nwhether to be glad or sorry. Her feelings had, of late, got into such a\nrapt and pious muddle that it seemed a little like being asked out to\nmeet God. On the other hand, she could not but see that the\ncircumstance would raise her standing at school, immeasurably. And this\nit did. As soon as the first shock had passed she communicated the fact\nfreely, and was shrewd enough not to relate how the invitation had come\nabout, allowing it to be put down, as her friends were but too ready to\ndo, to the effect produced on the minister by her silent adoration.\n\nThe Church girls were wild with envy. Laura was dragged up the garden\nwith an arm thrust through each of hers. Mr. Shepherd's holy calling\nand spiritual appearance stood him in small stead here; and the\nblackest interpretation was put on the matter of the visit.\n\n\"Nice things you'll be up to, the pair of you--oh, my aunt!\" ejaculated\nMaria.\n\n\"I think it's beastly risky her going at all,\" filled in Kate Horner,\ngobbling a little; for her upper lip overhung the lower. \"These saints\nare oftenest bad 'uns.\"\n\n\"Yes, and with an Aunt Sally like that for a wife.--Now look here,\nKiddy, just you watch you're not left alone with him in the dark.\"\n\n\"And mind, you've got to tell us everything--every blessed thing!\"\n\nLaura was called for, on Saturday morning, by the maiden sister of her\ndivinity. Miss Isabella Shepherd was a fair, short, pleasant young\nwoman, with a nervous, kindly smile, and a congenital inability to look\nyou in the face when speaking to you; so that the impression she made\nwas that of a perpetual friendliness, directed, however, not at you,\nbut at the inanimate objects around you. Laura was so tickled by this\npeculiarity, which she spied the moment she entered the waiting-room,\nthat at first she could take in nothing else. Afterwards, when the\nnovelty had worn off, she subjected her companion to a closer scrutiny,\nand from the height of thirteen years had soon taxed her with being a\nfrumpish old maid; the valiant but feeble efforts Miss Isabella made to\nentertain her, as they walked along, only strengthening her in this\nopinion.\n\nNot very far from the College they entered a small, two-storied stone\nhouse, which but for an iron railing and a shrub or two gave right on\nthe street.\n\n\"Will you come up to the study?\" said Miss Isabella, smiling warmly,\nand ogling the door-mat. \"I'm sure Robby would like to see you at once.\"\n\nRobby? Her saint called Robby?--Laura blushed.\n\nBut at the head of the stairs they were brought up short by Mrs.\nShepherd, who, policeman-like, raised a warning hand.\n\n\"Hssh ... ssh ... sh!\" she breathed, and simultaneously half-closed her\neyes, as if imitating slumber. \"Robby has just lain down for a few\nminutes. How are you, dear?\"--in a whisper. \"I'm so pleased to see you.\"\n\nShe looked even more faded than in church. But she was very kind, and\nin the bedroom insisted on getting out a clean towel for Laura.\n\n\"Now we'll go down.--It's only lunch to-day, for Robby has a\nconfirmation-class immediately afterwards, and doesn't care to eat\nmuch.\"\n\nThey descended to the dining-room, but though the meal was served, did\nnot take their seats: they stood about, in a kind of anxious silence.\nThis lasted for several minutes; then, heavy footsteps were heard\ntrampling overhead: these persisted, but did not seem to advance, and\nat length there was a loud, impatient shout of: \"Maisie!\"\n\nBoth ladies were perceptibly flurried. \"He can't find something,\" said\nMiss Isabella in a stage-whisper; while Mrs. Shepherd, taking the front\nof her dress in both hands, set out for the stairs with the short,\nclumsy jerks which, in a woman, pass for running.\n\nA minute or two later the origin of the fluster came in, looking, it\nmust be confessed, not much more amiable than his voice had been: he\nwas extremely pale, too, his blue eyes had hollow rings round them, and\nthere were tired wrinkles on his forehead. However he offered Laura a\nfriendly hand which she took with her soul in her eyes.\n\n\"Well, and so this is the young lady fresh from the halls of learning,\nis it?\" he asked, after a mumbled grace, as he carved a rather naked\nmutton-bone: the knife caught in the bone; he wrenched it free with an\nill-natured tweak. \"And what do they teach you at college, miss, eh?\"\nhe went on. \"French? ... Greek? ... Latin? How goes it? INFANDUM,\nREGINA, JUBES RENOVARE DOLOREM--isn't that the way of it? And then ...\nlet me see! It's so long since I went to school, you know.\"\n\n\"TROJANAS UT OPES ET LAMENTABILE REGNUM ERUERINT DANAI,\" said Laura,\nalmost blind with pride and pleasure.\n\n\"Well, well, well!\" he exclaimed, in what seemed tremendous surprise;\nbut, even as she spoke, his thoughts were swept away; for he had taken\nup a mustard-pot and found it empty. \"Yes, yes, here we are again! Not\na scrap of mustard on the table. \"--His voice was angrily resigned.\n\n\"With MUTTON, Robby dear?\" ventured Mrs. Shepherd, with the utmost\nhumbleness.\n\n\"With mutton if I choose!\" he retorted violently. \"WILL you, Maisie, be\nkind enough to allow me to know my own tastes best, and not dictate to\nme what I shall eat?\"\n\nBut Mrs. Shepherd, murmuring: \"Oh dear! it's that dreadful girl,\" had\nalready made a timid spring at the bell.\n\n\"Poor Robby ... so rushed again!\" said Isabella in a reproachful tone.\n\n\"And while she's here she may bring the water and the glasses as well,\"\nsnarled the master of the house, who had run a flaming eye over the\ntable.\n\n\"Tch, tch, tch!\" said Mrs. Shepherd, with so little spirit that Laura\nfelt quite sorry for her.\n\n\"REALLY, Maisie!\" said Miss Isabella. \"And when the poor boy's so\nrushed, too.\"\n\nThis guerilla warfare continued throughout luncheon, and left Laura\nwondering why, considering the dearth of time, and the distress of the\nladies at each fresh contretemps, they did not jump up and fetch the\nmissing articles themselves--as Mother would have done--instead of each\ntime ringing the bell and waiting for the appearance of the saucy,\nunwilling servant. As it turned out, however, their behaviour had a\npedagogic basis. It seemed that they hoped, by constantly summoning the\nmaid, to sharpen her memory. But Mrs. Shepherd was also implicated in\nthe method; and this was the reason why Isabella--as she afterwards\nexplained to Laura--never offered her a thimbleful of help.\n\n\"My sister-in-law is nothing of a manager,\" she said. \"But we still\ntrust she will improve in time, if she always has her attention drawn\nto her forgetfulness--at least Robby does; I'm afraid I have rather\n[P.165] given her up. But Robby's patience is angelic.\" And Laura was\nof the same opinion, since the couple had been married for more than\nseven years.\n\nThe moment the meal, which lasted a quarter of an hour, was over, Mr.\nShepherd clapped on his shovel-hat and started, with long strides, for\nhis class, Mrs. Shepherd, who had not been quite ready, scuttling along\na hundred yards behind him, with quick, fussy steps, and bonnet an awry.\n\nLaura and Isabella stood at the gate.\n\n\"I ought really to have gone, too,\" said Isabella, and smiled at the\ngutter. \"But as you are here, Robby said I had better stay at home\nto-day.--Now what would you like to do?\"\n\nThis opened up a dazzling prospect, with the whole of Melbourne before\none. But Laura was too polite to pretend anything but indifference.\n\n\"Well, perhaps you wouldn't mind staying in then? I want so much to\ncopy out Robby's sermon. I always do it, you know, for he can't read\nhis own writing. But he won't expect it to-day and he'll be so pleased.\"\n\nIt was a cool, quiet little house, with the slightly unused smell in\nthe rooms that betokens a lack of children. Laura did not dislike the\nquiet, and sat contentedly in the front parlour till evening fell. Not,\nhowever, that she was really within hundreds of miles of Melbourne; for\nthe wonderful book that she held on her knee was called KING SOLOMON'S\nMINES, and her eyes never rose from the pages.\n\nSupper, when it came, was as scrappy and as hurried as lunch had been:\na class of working-men was momently expected, and Robby had just time\nto gulp down a cup of tea. Nor could he converse; for he was obliged to\nspare his throat.\n\nAfterwards the three of them sat listening to the loud talking\noverhead. This came down distinctly through the thin ceiling, and Mr.\nShepherd's voice--it went on and on--sounded, at such close quarters,\nboth harsh and rasping. Mrs. Shepherd was mending a stole; Isabella\nstooped over the sermon, which she was writing like copperplate. Laura\nsat in a corner with her hands before her: she had finished her book,\nbut her eyes were still visionary. When any of the three spoke, it was\nin a low tone.\n\nTowards nine o'clock Mrs. Shepherd fetched a little saucepan, filled it\nwith milk, and set it on the hob; and after this she hovered\nundecidedly between door and fireplace, like a distracted moth.\n\n\"Now do try to get it right to-night, Maisie,\" admonished Isabella;\nand, turning her face, if not her glance, to Laura, she explained: \"It\nmust boil, but not have a scrap of skin on it, or Robby won't look at\nit.\"\n\nPresently the working-men were heard pounding down the stairs, and\nthereupon Maisie vanished from the room.\n\nThe next day Laura attended morning and evening service at St\nStephen's-on-the-Hill, and in the afternoon made one of Isabella's\nclass at Sunday school.\n\nThat morning she had wakened, in what seemed to be the middle of the\nnight, to find Isabella dressing by the light of a single candle.\n\n\"Don't you get up,\" said the latter. \"We're all going to early service,\nand I just want to make Robby some bread and milk beforehand. He would\nrather communicate fasting, but he has to have something, for he\ndoesn't get home till dinner-time.\"\n\nWhen midday came, Robby was very fractious. The mutton-bone--no cooking\nwas done--was harder than ever to carve with decency; and poor Mrs.\nShepherd, for sheer fidgetiness, could hardly swallow a bite.\n\nBut at nine o'clock that evening, when the labours of the day were\nbehind him, he was persuaded to lie down on the sofa and drink a glass\nof port. At his head sat Mrs. Shepherd, holding the wine and some\nbiscuits; at his feet Isabella, stroking his soles. The stimulant\nrevived him; he grew quite mellow, and presently, taking his wife's\nhand, he held it in his--and Laura felt sure that all his querulousness\nwas forgiven him for the sake of this moment. Then, finding a willing\nlistener in the black-eyed little girl who sat before him, he began to\ntalk, to relate his travels, giving, in particular, a vivid account of\nsome months he had once spent in Japan. Laura, who liked nothing better\nthan travelling at second hand--since any other way was out of the\nquestion--Laura spent a delightful hour, and said so.\n\n\"Yes, Robby quite surpassed himself to-night, I thought,\" said Isabella\nas she let down her hair. \"I never heard anyone who could talk as well\nas he does when he likes.--Can you keep a secret, Laura? We are sure,\nMaisie and I, that Robby will be a Bishop some day. And he means to be,\nhimself.--But don't say a word about it; he won't have it mentioned out\nof the house.--And meanwhile he's working as hard as he can, and we're\nsaving every penny, to let him take his next degree.\"\n\n\"I do hope you'll come again,\" she said the following morning, as they\nwalked back to the College. \"I don't mind telling you now, I felt quite\nnervous when Robby said we were to ask you. I've had no experience of\nlittle girls. But you haven't been the least trouble--not a bit. And\nI'm sure it was good for Robby having something young about the house.\nSo mind you write and tell us when you have another holiday\"--and\nIsabella's smile beamed out once more, none the less kindly because it\nwas caught, on its way to Laura, by the gate they were passing through.\n\nLaura, whose mind was set on a good, satisfying slab of cake, promised\nto do this, although her feelings had suffered so great a change that\nshe was not sure whether she would keep her word. She was pulled two\nways: on the one side was the remembrance of Mr. Shepherd hacking\ncantankerously at the bare mutton-bone; on the other, the\ncherry-blossom and the mousmes of Japan.\n\n\n\n\nXVII.\n\n\nOHNMACHT ZUR LUGE IST LANGE NOCH NICHT LIEBE ZUR WAHRHEIT.... WER NICHT\nLUGEN KANN, WEISS NICHT, WAS WAHRHEIT IST.\n\nNIETZSCHE\n\n\nA pantomime of knowing smiles and interrogatory grimaces greeted her,\nwhen, having brushed the cake-crumbs from her mouth, she joined her\nclass. For the twinkling of an eye Laura hesitated, being unprepared.\nThen, however, as little able as a comic actor to resist pandering to\nthe taste of the public, she yielded to this hunger for spicy\nhappenings, and did what was expected of her: clapped her hands, one\nover the other, to her breast, and cast her eyes heavenwards. Curiosity\nand anticipation reached a high pitch; while Laura, by tragically\nshaking her head, gave it to be understood that no signs could transmit\nwhat she had been through, since seeing her friends last.\n\nIn the thick of this message she was, unluckily, caught by Dr Pughson,\nwho, after dealing her one of his butcherly gibes, bade her to the\nblackboard, to grapple with the Seventh Proposition.\n\nThe remainder of the forenoon was a tussle with lessons not glanced at\nsince Friday night.--Besides, Laura seldom forestalled events by\nthinking over them, choosing rather to trust for inspiration to the\nspur of the moment.\n\nMorning school at an end, she was laid hands on and hurried off to a\nretired corner of the garden. Here, four friends squatted round,\ndetermined to extract her adventures from her--to the last pip.\n\nLaura was in a pretty pickle. Did she tell the plain truth, state the\npedestrian facts--and this she would have been capable of doing with\nsome address; for she had looked through her hosts with a perspicacity\nuncommon in a girl of her age; had once again put to good use those\n'sharp, unkind eyes' which Mother deplored. She had seen an overworked,\nunderfed man, who nagged like any woman, and made slaves of two weak,\nadoring ladies; and she very well knew that, as often as her thoughts\nin future alighted on Mr. Robby, she would think of him pinching and\nscrewing, with a hawk-like eye on a shadowy bishopric. Of her warm\nfeelings for him, genuine or imaginary, not a speck remained. The first\ntouch of reality had sunk them below her ken, just as a drop of cold\nwater sinks the floating grounds in a coffee-pot ... But did she\nconfess this, confess also that, save for a handful of monosyllables,\nher only exchange of words with him had been a line of Virgil; and,\nstill more humbling, that she had liked his wife and sister better than\nhimself: did this come to light, she would forfeit every sou of the\nprestige the visit had lent and yet promised to lend her. And, now that\nthe possible moment for parting with this borrowed support had come,\nshe recognised how greatly she had built on it.\n\nThese thoughts whizzed through her mind, as she darted a look at the\nfour predatory faces that hemmed her in. Tilly's was one of them: the\nlightly mocking smile sat on it that Laura had come to know so well,\nsince her maladroit handling of Bob. She would kill that smile--and if\nshe had to die for it herself.\n\nStill, she must be cautious, wary in picking her steps. Especially as\nshe had not the ghost of an idea how to begin.\n\nMeanwhile cries of impatience buzzed round her.\n\n\"She doesn't want to tell.\"\n\n\"Mean brute!\"\n\n\"Shouldn't wonder if it's too dashed shady.\"\n\n\"Didn't I SAY he was a bad 'un?\"\n\n\"I bet you there's nothing to tell,\" said Tilly cockily, and turned up\nher nose.\n\n\"Yes, there is,\" flung out Laura, at once put on the defensive, and as\nshe spoke she coloured.\n\n\"Look at her! Look how red she's got!\"\n\n\"And after she promised--the sneak!\"\n\n\"I'm not a sneak. I AM going to tell. But you're all in such a blooming\nhurry.\"\n\n\"Oh, fire away, slow-coach!\"\n\n\"Well, girls,\" began Laura gamely, breathing a little hard.--\"But,\nmind, you must never utter a word of what I'm going to tell you. It's a\ndead secret, and IF you let on----\"\n\n\"S' help me God!\"\n\n\"Ananias and Sapphira!\"\n\n\"Oh, DO hurry up.\"\n\n\"Well ... well, he's just the most--oh, I don't know how to say it,\ngirls--the MOST----\"\n\n\"Just scrumptious, I suppose, eh?\"\n\n\"Just positively scrumptious, and ...\"\n\n\"And what'd he do?\"\n\n\"And what about his old sketch of a wife?\"\n\n\"Her? Oh\"--and Laura squeezed herself desperately for the details that\nWOULD not come--\"oh, why she's just a perfect old ... old cat. And\ntwenty years older than him.\"\n\n\"What on earth did he marry her for?\"\n\n\"Guess he's pretty sick of being tied to an old gin like that?\"\n\n\"I should say! Perfectly MISERABLE. He can't think now why he let\nhimself be induced to marry her. He just despises her.\"\n\n\"Well, why in the name of all that's holy did he take her?\"\n\nLaura cast a mysterious glance round, and lowered her voice. \"Well, you\nsee, she had LOTS of money and he had none. He was ever so poor. And\nshe paid for him to be a clergyman.\"\n\n\"Go on! As poor as all that?\"\n\n\"As poor as a church-mouse.--But, oh,\" she hastened to add, at the\nvisible cooling-off of the four faces, \"he comes of a MOST\ndistinguished family. His father was a lord or a baronet or something\nlike that, but he married a beautiful girl who hadn't a penny against\nhis father's will and so he cut him out of his will.\"\n\n\"I say!\"\n\n\"Oh, never mind the father.\"\n\n\"Yes. Well, now he feels under an awful obligation to her, and all that\nsort of thing, you know.\"\n\n\"And she drives it home, I bet. She looks a nipper.\"\n\n\"Is always throwing it in his face.\"\n\n\"What a ghoul!\"\n\n\"He'd do just ANYTHING to get rid of her, but--Girls, it's a dead\nsecret; you must swear you won't tell.\"\n\nGestures of assurance were showered on her.\n\n\"Well, he's to be a Bishop some day. It's promised him.\"\n\n\"Holy Moses!\"\n\n\"And I suppose he can't divorce her, because of that?\"\n\n\"No, of course not. He'll have to drag her with him like millstone\nround his neck.\"\n\n\"And he'd twigged right enough you were gone on him?\"\n\nLaura's coy smile hinted many things. \"I should say so. Since the very\nfirst day in church. He said--but I don't like to tell you what he\nsaid.\"\n\n\"You must!\"\n\n\"No. You'll only call me conceited.\"\n\n\"No fear, Kiddy. Out with it!\"\n\n\"Well, then, he said he saw me as soon as he got in the pulpit, and he\nwondered ever so much who the girl was with the eyes like sloes, and\nthe skin like ... like cream.\"\n\n\"Snakes-alive-oh! He went it strong.\"\n\n\"And how often were you alone with him?\"\n\n\"Yes, and if he had met me before he was married--but no, I can't tell\nany more.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't be such an ass!\"\n\n\"No, I can't.--Well, I'll whisper it then ... but only to Maria,\" and\nleaning over Laura put her lips to Maria's ear.\n\nThe reason for this by-stroke she could not have told: the detail she\nimparted did not differ substantially from those that had gone\nbefore.-- But by now she was at the end of her tether.\n\nHere, fortunately for Laura, the dinner-bell rang, and the girls had to\ntake to their heels in order to get their books put away before grace.\nThroughout the meal, from their scattered seats, they exchanged looks\nof understanding, and their cheeks were pink.\n\nIn the afternoon, Laura was again called on to prove her mettle. Her\ncompanion on the daily walk was Kate Horner. Kate had been one of the\nfour, and did not lose this chance of beating up fresh particulars.\n\nAfter those first few awkward moments, however, which had come wellnigh\nbeing a fiasco, Laura had no more trouble with her story. Indeed, the\nplunge once taken, it was astounding how easy it became to make up\nthings about the Shepherds; the difficulty was, to know where to stop.\nFictitious details crowded thick and fast upon her--a regular\nhotchpotch; she had only to stretch out her hand and seize what she\nneeded. It was simpler than the five-times multiplication-table, and\ndid not need to be learnt. But all the same she was not idle: she\npolished away at her flimflams, bringing them nearer and nearer\nprobability, never, thanks to her sound memory, contradicting herself\nor making a slip, and always able to begin again from the beginning.\n\nSuch initial scepticism as may have lurked in her hearers was soon got\nthe better of. For, crass realists though these young colonials were,\nand bluntly as they faced facts, they were none the less just as hungry\nfor romance as the most insatiable novel-reader. Romance in any guise\nwas hailed by them, and swallowed uncritically, though it was no more\npermitted to interfere with the practical conduct of their lives than\nit is in the case of just that novel-reader, who puts untruth and\nunreality from him, when he lays his book aside.--Another and weightier\nreason was, their slower brains could not conceive the possibility of\nsuch extraordinarily detailed lying as that to which Laura now\nsubjected them. Its very elaboration stood for its truth.\n\nAnd the days passed, and Laura had the happiest ideas. A strange thing\nabout them was that they came to her quite unsought, dropping on her\nlike Aladdin's oranges on his turban. All she had to do was to fit them\ninto their niche in her fabrication.\n\nAt first, her tale had been chiefly concerned with the internal rift in\nMr. Shepherd's home-life, and only in a minor degree with herself. But\nher public savoured the love-story most, and hence, consulting its\ntaste, as it is the tale-maker's bounden duty to do, Laura was obliged\nto develop this side of her narrative at the expense of the other. And\nthe more the girls heard, the more they wished to hear. She had early\nturned Miss Isabella into a staunch ally of her own, in the dissension\nshe had introduced into the curate's household; and one day she arrived\nat a hasty kiss, stolen in the vestry after evening service, while Mr.\nShepherd was taking off his surplice. The puzzle had been, to get\nherself into the vestry; but, once there, she saw what followed as if\nit had actually happened. She saw Mr. Shepherd's arm slipped with\ndiffident alacrity round her waist, and her own virtuous recoil; saw\nMaisie and Isabella waiting, sheep-like, in their pew, till it should\nplease the couple to emerge; saw the form of the verger moving about\nthe darkening church, as he put the lights out, one by one.\n\nBut the success this incident brought her turned Laura's head, making\nher so foolhardy in her inventions that Maria, who for all her boldness\nof speech was at heart a prude like the rest, grew uneasy.\n\n\"You're not to go to that house again, Kiddy. If you do, I'll peach to\nold Gurley.\"\n\nLaura ran upstairs to dress for tea, taking two steps at a time. On the\ntop landing, beside the great clothes-baskets, she collided with\nChinky, who was coming primly down.\n\n\"O ki, John!\" she greeted her, being in a vast good-humour. \"What do\nyou look so black for?\"\n\n\"Dunno. Why do you never walk with me nowadays, Laura? I say, you know\nabout that ring? You haven't forgotten?\"\n\n\"Course not. When am I to get it? It never turns up.\" Her eyes\nglittered as she asked, for she foresaw a further link in her chain.\n\"Soon, now?\"\n\nChinky nodded mysteriously. \"Pretty soon. And you promise faithfully\nnever to take it off?\"\n\n\"But it must be a NICE one ... with a red stone in it. And listen,\nChink, no one must ever know it was you who gave it me.\"\n\n\"All right, I swear. You're a darling to say you'll wear it,\" and\nputting her arm round Laura's shoulders, Chinky gave her a hearty kiss.\n\nThis was more than Laura had bargained for;--she freed herself,\nungraciously. \"Oh, don't!--now mind, a red stone, and for the third\nfinger of the left hand.\"\n\n\"Yes. And Laura, I've thought of something to put inside. SEMPER EADEM\n... do you like that, Laura?\"\n\n\"It'll do.--Look out, there's old Day!\" and leaving Chinky standing,\nshe ran down the corridor to her room.\n\n\n\n\nXVIII.\n\n\nDER VERBRECHER IST HAUFIG GENUG SEINER TAT NICHT GEWACHSEN.\n\nNIETZSCHE\n\n\nFor a month or more, Laura fed like a honeybee on the sweets of\nsuccess. And throve--even to the blindest eye. What had hitherto been\nlacking was now hers: the admiration and applause of her circle. And\nnever was a child so spurred and uplifted by praise as Laura. Without\nit, her nature tended to be wary and unproductive; and those in touch\nwith her, had they wished to make the most of her, would no more have\nstinted with the necessary incentive, that one stints a delicate rose\ntree in aids to growth. Laura could swallow praise in large doses,\nwithout becoming over-sure. Under the present stimulus she sat top in a\ncouple of classes, grew slightly ruddier in face, and much less\nshrinking in manner.\n\n\"Call her back at once and make her shut that door,\" cried Miss Day\nthickly, from behind one of the long, dining-hall tables, on which were\nranged stacks and piles of clean linen. She had been on early duty\nsince six o'clock.\n\nThe pupil-teacher in attendance stepped obediently into the passage;\nand Laura returned.\n\n\"Doors are made to be shut, Laura Rambotham, I'd have you remember\nthat!\" fumed Miss Day in the same indistinct voice: she was in the grip\nof a heavy cold, which had not been improved by the draughts of the\nhall.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Miss Day. I thought I had. I was a little late.\"\n\n\"That's your own lookout,\" barked the governess.--\"Oh, there you are at\nlast, Miss Snodgrass. I'd begun to think you weren't going to appear at\nall this morning. It's close on a quarter past seven.\"\n\n\"Sorry,\" said Miss Snodgrass laconically. \"My watch must be losing.--\nWell, I suppose I can begin by marking Laura Rambotham down late.--What\non earth are you standing there holding the door for?\"\n\n\"Miss Day knows--I don't,\" sauced Laura, and made her escape.\n\nShe did not let Miss Snodgrass's bad mark disturb her. No sooner had\nshe begun her practising than she fell to work again on the theme that\noccupied all her leisure moments, and was threatening to assume the\nbulk of an early Victorian novel. But she now built at her top-heavy\nedifice for her own enjoyment; and the usual fate of the robust liar\nhad overtaken her: she was beginning to believe in her own lies. Still\nshe never ventured to relax her critical alertness, her careful\nsurveillance of detail. For, just a day or two before, she had seen a\nquick flare-up of incredulity light Tilly's face, and oddly enough this\nhad happened when she tried her audience with a fact, a simple little\nfact, an incident that had really occurred. She had killed the doubt,\ninstantly, by smothering it with a fiction; but she could not forget\nthat it had existed. It has very perplexing; for otherwise her hearers\ndid not shy at a mortal thing; she could drive them where and how she\nchose.\n\nAt the present moment she was planning a great coup: nothing more or\nless than a frustrated attempt on her virtue. It was almost ready to be\nsubmitted to them--for she had read PAMELA with heartfelt interest\nduring the holidays--and only a few connecting links were missing, with\nwhich to complete her own case.\n\nThen, without the slightest warning, the blow fell.\n\nIt was a Sunday afternoon; the half-hour that preceded Sunday school.\nLaura, in company with several others, was in the garden, getting her\nBible chapter by heart, when Maria called her.\n\n\"Laura! Come here. I want to tell you something.\"\n\nLaura approached, her lips in busy motion. \"What's up?\"\n\n\"I say, chicken, your nose is going to be put out of joint.\"\n\n\"Mine? What do you mean?\" queried Laura, and had a faint sense of\nimpending disaster.\n\n\"What I say. M. Pidwall's asked to the you-know-who's next Saturday.\"\n\n\"No, she's not!\" cried Laura vehemently, and clapped her Bible to.\n\n\"S'help me God, she is,\" asserted Maria.--\"Look out, don't set the\nplace on fire.\"\n\n\"How do you know? ... who told you?\"\n\n\"M. P. herself--Gosh, but you are a jealous little cub. Oh, go on,\nKiddy, don't take it like that. I guess he won't give you away.\"--For\nLaura was as pale as a moment before she had been scarlet.\n\nAlleging a violent headache, she mounted to her room, and sat down on\nher bed. She felt stunned, and it took her some time to recover her\nwits. Sitting on the extreme edge of the bedstead, she stared at\n[P.181] the objects in the room without seeing them. \"M. P.'s going\nthere on Saturday ... M. P.'s going there on Saturday,\" she repeated\nstupidly, and, with her hands pressed on her hips, rocked herself to\nand fro, after the fashion of an older woman in pain.\n\nThe fact was too appalling to be faced; her mind postponed it. Instead,\nshe saw the fifty-five at Sunday school--where they were at this\nminute--drawn up in a line round the walls of the dining-hall. She saw\nthem rise to wail out the hymn; saw Mr. Strachey on his chair in the\nmiddle of the floor, perpetually nimming with his left leg. And, as she\npictured the familiar scene to herself, she shivered with a sudden\nsense of isolation: behind each well-known face lurked a possible enemy.\n\nIf it had only not been M. P.!--that was the first thought that\ncrystallised. Anyone else! ... from any of the rest she might have\nhoped for some mercy. But Mary Pidwall was one of those people--there\nwere plenty such--before whom a nature like Laura's was inclined, at\nthe best of times, to shrink away, keenly aware of its own paltriness\nand ineffectualness. Mary was rectitude in person: and it cannot be\ndenied that, to Laura, this was synonymous with hard, narrow,\nungracious. Not quite a prig, though: there was fun in Mary, and life\nin her; but it was neither fun nor vivacity of a kind that Laura could\nfeel at ease with. Such capers as the elder girl cut were only\nskin-deep; they were on the surface of her character, had no real roots\nin her: just as the pieces of music she played on the piano were\naccidents of the moment, without deeper significance. To Mary, life was\nalready serious, full of duties. She knew just what she wanted, too,\nwhere she wanted to go and how to get there; her plans were cut and\ndried. She was clever, very industrious, the head of several of her\nclasses. Nor was she ever in conflict with the authorities: she moved\namong the rules of the school as safely as an egg-dancer among his\neggs. For the simple reasons that temptations seemed to pass her by.\nThere was, besides, a kind of manly exactness in her habit of thinking\nand speaking; and it was this trait her companions tried to symbolise,\nin calling her by the initial letters of her name.\n\nShe and Laura, though classmates, had never drawn together. It is true,\nMary was sixteen, and, at that time of life, a couple of years dig a\nwide breach. But there was also another reason. Once, in the innocence\nof her heart, Laura had let the cat out of the bag that an uncle of\nhers lived in the up-country township to which Mary belonged.\n\nThe girl had eyed her coldly, incredulously. \"What? That dreadful man\nyour uncle?\" she had exclaimed: she herself was the daughter of a\nchurch dignitary. \"I should say I did know him--by reputation at least.\nAnd it's quite enough, thank you.\"\n\nNow Laura had understood that Uncle Tom--he needed but a pair of gold\nearrings to pose as the model for a Spanish Grandee--that Uncle Tom WAS\nodd, in this way: he sometimes took more to drink than was good for\nhim; but she had never suspected him of being \"dreadful\", or a byword\nin Wantabadgery. Colouring to the roots of her hair, she murmured\nsomething about him of course not being recognised by the rest of the\nfamily; but M. P., she was sure, had never looked on her with the same\neyes again.\n\nSuch was the rigid young moralist into whose hands her fate was given.\n\nShe sat and meditated these things, in spiritless fashion. She would\nhave to confess to her fabrications--that was plain. M. P.'s precise\nmind would bring back a precise account of how matters stood in the\nShepherd household: not by an iota would the truth be swerved from.\nWhy, oh why, had she not foreseen this possibility? What evil spirit\nhad prompted her and led her on?--But, before her brain could\ncontemplate the awful necessity of rising and branding herself as a\nliar, it sought desperately for a means of escape. For a wink, she even\nnursed the idea of dragging in a sham man, under the pretence that Mr.\nShepherd had been but a blind, used by her to screen some one else. But\nthis yarn, twist it as she might, would not pass muster. Against it was\nthe mass of her accumulated detail.\n\nShe sat there, devising scheme after scheme. Not one of them would do.\n\nWhen, at tea-time, she rose to wash her face before going downstairs,\nthe sole point on which she had come to clearness was, that just seven\ndays lay between her and detection.--Yet after all, she reminded\nherself, seven days made a week, and a week was a good long time.\nPerhaps something would happen between now and Saturday. M. P. might\nhave an accident and break her leg, and not be able to go. Or thin,\npoorly-fed Mr. Shepherd fall ill from overwork.--Oh, how she would\nrejoice to hear of it!\n\nAnd, if the worst came to the worst and she HAD to tell, at least it\nshould not be to-day. To-day was Sunday; and people's thoughts were\nfrightfully at liberty. To-morrow they would be engaged again; and, by\nto-morrow, she herself would have grown more accustomed to the\nidea.--Besides, how foolish to have been in too great a hurry, should\nsomething come to pass that rendered confession needless.\n\nOn waking next morning, however, and accounting, with a throb, for the\nleaden weight on her mind, she felt braver, and quite determined to\nmake a clean breast of her misdoings. Things could not go on like this.\nBut no sooner was she plunged into the routine of the day than her\ndecision slackened: it was impossible to find just the right moment to\nbegin. Early in the morning everyone was busy looking over lessons, and\nwould not thank you for the upset, the dinner-hour was all too short;\nafter school, on the walk, she had a partner who knew nothing about the\naffair, and after tea she practised.--Hence, on Monday her purpose\nfailed her.\n\nOn Tuesday it was the same; the right moment never presented itself.\n\nIn bed that night she multiplied the remaining days into hours. They\nmade one hundred and twenty. That heartened her a little; considered\nthus, the time seemed very much longer; and so she let Wednesday slip\nby, without over-much worry.\n\nOn Thursday she not only failed to own up, but indulged anew.\n\nAll the week, as if Mary Pidwall's coming visit worked upon them, the\ngirls had been very greedy for more love-story, and had shown\nthemselves decidedly nettled by Laura's refusal to continue; for this\nwas the week when the great revelation she had hinted at should have\nbeen made. And one afternoon when the four were twitting her, and\nthings were looking very black, Laura was incited by some devil to\nthrow them, not, it is true, the savoury incident their mouths watered\nfor, but a fresh fiction--just as the beset traveller throws whatever\nhe has at hand, to the ravenous wolves that press round the sledge. At\nthe moment, the excitement that accompanies inspiration kept her up;\nbut afterwards she had a stinging fit of remorse; and her\nself-reproaches were every whit as bitter as those of the man who has\nagain broken the moral law he has vowed to respect, and who now sees\nthat he is powerless against recurring temptation.\n\nWhen she remembered those four rapacious faces, Laura realised that,\ncome what might, she would never have the courage to confess. To them,\nat least. That night in deep humility she laid her sin bare to God,\nimploring Him, even though He could not pardon it, to avert the\nconsequences from her.\n\nThe last days were also darkened by her belief that M. P. had got wind\nof her romancings: as, indeed, was quite likely; for the girls' tongues\nwere none too safe. Mary looked at her from time to time with such a\nsternly suspicious eye that Laura's very stomach quailed within her.\n\nAnd meanwhile the generous hours had declined to less than half.\n\n\"Twice more to get up, and twice to go to bed,\" she reckoned aloud to\nherself on Saturday morning.\n\nShe was spending that week-end at Godmother's. It was as dull as usual;\nshe had ample leisure to brood over what lay before her. It was now a\ncertainty, fixed, immovable; for, by leaving school that day without\nhaving spoken, she had burned her ships behind her. When she went back\non Monday M. P. would be there, and every loophole closed. On Sunday\nevening she made an excuse and went down into the garden. There was no\nmoon; but, overhead, the indigo-blue was a prodigal glitter of\nstars--myriads of silver eyes that perforated the sky. They sparkled\nwith a cold disregard of the small girl standing under the mulberry\ntree; but Laura, too, was only half-alive to their magnificence. Her\nthoughts ran on suicide, on making an end of her blighted career. God\nwas evidently not going to be generous or long-suffering enough to come\nto her aid; and in imagination she saw the fifty-five gaining on her\nlike a pack of howling hyaenas; saw Mrs. Gurley, Mr. Strachey--Mother.\nDetection and exposure, she knew it now, were the most awful things the\nworld held. But she had nothing handy: neither a rope, nor poison, nor\nwas there a dam in the neighbourhood.\n\nThat night she had the familiar dream that she was being \"stood up\" and\nexpelled, as Annie Johns had been: thousands of tongues shouted her\nguilt; she was hunted like a wallaby. She wakened with a scream, and\nMarina, her bedfellow, rose on one elbow and lighted the candle.\nCrumpled and dishevelled, Laura lay outside the sheet that should have\ncovered her; and her pillow had slipped to the floor.\n\n\"What on earth's the matter? Dreaming? Then depend on it you've eaten\nsomething that's disagreed with you.\"\n\nHow she dragged her legs back to school that morning, Laura never knew.\nAt the sight of the great stone building her inner disturbance was such\nthat she was nearly sick. Even the unobservant Marina was forced to a\nremark.\n\n\"You do look a bit peaky. I'm sure your stomach's out of order. Your\nshould take a dose of castor-oil to-night, before you go to bed.\"\n\nThough it was a blazing November day, her fingers were cold as she took\noff her hat and changed her white frock. \"For the last time,\" she\nmurmured; by which she meant the last time in untarnished honour. And\nshe folded and hung up her clothes, with a neatness that was foreign to\nher.\n\nClasses were in full swing when she went downstairs; nothing could\nhappen now till the close of morning school. But Laura signalised the\nbeginning of her downfall, the end of her comet-like flight, by losing\nher place in one form after another, the lessons she had prepared on\nFriday evening having gone clean out of her head.\n\nDirectly half-past twelve struck, she ran to the top of the garden and\nhid herself under a tree. There she crouched, her fingers in her ears,\nher heart thumping as if it would break. Till the dinner-bell rang.\nThen she was forced to emerge--and no tottering criminal, about to face\nthe scaffold, has ever had more need of Dutch courage than Laura in\nthis moment. Peeping round the corner of the path she saw the fateful\ngroup: M. P. the centre of four gesticulating figures. She loitered\ntill they had scattered and disappeared; then with shaking legs crept\nto the house. At the long tables the girls still stood, waiting for Mr.\nStrachey; and the instant Laura set foot in the hall, five pairs of\neyes caught her, held her, pinned her down, as one pins a butterfly to\na board. She was much too far gone to think of tossing her head and\nbraving things out, now that the crisis had come. Pale, guilty,\nwretched, she sidled to her seat. This was near Maria's, and, as she\npassed, Maria leant back.\n\n\"You VILE little liar!\"\n\n\"How's that shy little mouse of a girl we had here a month or two ago?\"\nMr. Shepherd had inquired. \"Let me see--what was her name again?\"\n\nTo which Miss Isabella had replied: \"Well, you know, Robby dear, you\nreally hardly saw her. You had so much to do, poor boy, just when she\nwas here. Her name was Laura--Laura Rambotham.\"\n\nAnd Mrs. Shepherd gently: \"Yes, a nice little girl. But very young for\nher age. And SO shy.\"\n\n\"You wretched little lying sneak!\"\n\nIn vain Laura wept and protested.\n\n\"You made me do it. I should never have told a word, if it hadn't been\nfor you.\"\n\nThis point of view enraged them. \"What? You want to put it on us now,\ndo you? ... you dirty little skunk! To say WE made you tell that pack\nof lies?--Look here: as long as you stay in this blooming shop, I'll\nnever open my mouth to you again!\"\n\n\"Someone ought to tell old Gurley and have her expelled. That's all\nshe's fit for. Spreading disgusting stories about people who've been\nkind to her. They probably only asked her there out of charity. She's\nas poor as dirt.\"\n\n\"Wants her bottom smacked--that's what I say!\"\n\nThus Maria, and, with her, Kate Horner.\n\nTilly was cooler and bitterer. \"I was a dashed fool ever to believe a\nword. I might have known her little game. She? Why, when I took her out\nto see my cousin Bob, she couldn't say bo to a goose. He laughed about\nher afterwards like anything; said she ought to have come in a\nperambulator, with a nurse.--YOU make anyone in love with you--you!\"\nAnd Tilly spat, to show her disdain.\n\n\"What have they been saying to you, Laura?\" whispered Chinky, pale and\nfrightened. \"Whatever is the matter?\"\n\n\"Mind your own business and go away,\" sobbed Laura.\n\n\"I am, I'm going,\" said Chinky humbly.--\"Oh, Laura, I WISH you had that\nring.\"\n\n\"Oh, blow you and your ring! I hate the very name of it,\" cried Laura,\nmaddened.--And retreating to a lavatory, which was the only private\nplace in the school, she wept her full.\n\nThey all, every girl of them, understood white lies, and practised\nthem. They might also have forgiven her a lie of the good, plain,\nstraightforward, thumping order. What they could not forgive, or get\nover, was the extraordinary circumstantiality of the fictions which\nwith she had gulled them: to be able to invent lies with such\nproficiency meant that you had been born with a criminal bent.--And as\na criminal she was accordingly treated.\n\nEven the grown-up girls heard a garbled version of the story.\n\n\"Whyever did you do it?\" one of them asked Laura curiously; it was a\nvery pretty girl, called Evelyn, with twinkling brown eyes.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Laura abjectly; and this was almost true.\n\n\"But I say! ... nasty tarradiddles about people who'd been so nice to\nyou? What made you tell them?\"\n\n\"I don't KNOW. They just came.\"\n\nThe girl's eyes smiled. \"Well, I never! Poor little Kiddy,\" she said as\nshe turned away.\n\nBut this was the only kind word Laura heard. For many and many a night\nafter, she cried herself to sleep.\n\n\n\n\nXIX.\n\n\nThus Laura went to Coventry.--Not that the social banishment she now\nsuffered was known by that name. To the majority of the girls Coventry\nwas just a word in the geography book, a place where ribbons were said\nto be made, and where for a better-read few, some one had hung with\ngrooms and porters on a bridge; this detail, odd to say, making a\ndeeper impression on their young minds than the story of Lady Godiva,\nwhich was looked upon merely as a naughty anecdote.\n\nBut, by whatever name it was known, Laura's ostracism was complete. She\nhad been sampled, tested, put on one side. And not the softest-hearted\ncould find an excuse for her behaviour.\n\nIt was but another instance of how misfortune dogs him who is down,\nthat Chinky should choose this very moment to bring further shame upon\nher.\n\nOn one of the miserable days that were now the rule, when Laura would\nhave liked best to be a rabbit, hid deep in its burrow; as she was\ngoing upstairs one afternoon, she met Jacob, the man-of-all-work,\ncoming down. He had a trunk on his shoulder. Throughout the day she had\nbeen aware of a subdued excitement among the boarders; they had stood\nabout in groups, talking in low voices--talking about her, she\nbelieved, from the glances that were thrown over shoulders at her as\nshe passed. She made herself as small as she could; but when tea-time\ncame, and then [P.192] supper, and Chinky had not appeared at either\nmeal, curiosity got the better of her, and she tried to pump one of the\nyounger girls.\n\nMaria came up while she was speaking, and the child ran away; for the\nlittle ones aped their elders in making Laura taboo.\n\n\"What, liar? You want to stuff us you don't know why she's gone?\" said\nMaria. \"No, thank you, it's not good enough. You can't bamboozle us\nthis time.\"\n\n\"Sapphira up to her tricks again, is she?\" threw in the inseparable\nKate, who had caught the last words. \"No, by dad, we don't tell liars\nwhat they know already.--So put that in your pipe and smoke it!\"\n\nOnly bit by bit did Laura dig out their meaning: then, the horrible\ntruth lay bare. Chinky had been dismissed--privately because she was a\nboarder--from the school. Her crime was: she had taken half-a-sovereign\nfrom the purse of one of her room-mates. When taxed with the theft, she\nwept that she had not taken it for herself, but to buy a ring for Laura\nRambotham; and, with this admission on her lips, she passed out of\ntheir lives, leaving Laura, her confederate, behind.--Yes, confederate;\nfor, in the minds of most, liar and thief were synonymous.\n\nLaura had not cared two straws for Chinky; she found what the latter\nhad done, \"mean and disgusting\", and said so, stormily; but of course\nwas not believed. Usually too proud to defend herself, she here\nreturned to the charge again and again; for the hint of connivance had\ntouched her on the raw. But she strove in vain to prove her innocence:\nshe could not get her enemies to grasp the abysmal difference between\nmerely making up a story about people, and laying hands on others'\nproperty; if she could do the one, she was capable of the other; and\nher companions remained convinced that, if she had not actually had her\nfingers in some one's purse, she had, by a love of jewellery, incited\nChinky to the theft. And so, after a time, Laura gave up the attempt\nand suffered in silence; and it WAS suffering; for her schoolfellows\nwere cruel with that intolerance, that unimaginative dullness, which\nmakes a woman's cruelty so hard to bear. Laura had to accustom herself\nto hear every word she said doubted; to hear some one called to, before\nher face, to attest her statements; to see her room-mates lock up their\npurses under her very nose.\n\nHowever, only three weeks had still to run till the Christmas holidays.\nShe drew twenty-one strokes on a sheet of paper, which she pinned to\nthe wall above her bed; and each morning she ran her pencil through a\nfresh line. She was quite resolved to beg Mother not to send her back\nto school: if she said she was not getting proper food, that would be\nenough to put Mother up in arms.\n\nThe boxes were being fetched from the lumber-rooms and distributed\namong their owners, when a letter arrived from Mother saying that the\ntwo little boys had sandy blight, and that Laura would not be able to\ncome home under two or three weeks, for fear of infection. These weeks\nshe was to spend, in company with Pin, at a watering-place down the\nBay, where one of her aunts had a cottage.\n\nThe news was welcome to Laura: she had shrunk from the thought of\nMother's searching eye. And at the cottage there would be none of her\ngrown-up relatives to face; only an old housekeeper, who was looking\nafter a party of boys.\n\nHence, when speech day was over, instead of setting out on an\nup-country railway journey, Laura, under the escort of Miss Snodgrass,\nwent on board one of the steamers that ploughed the Bay.\n\n\"I should say sea-air'll do you good--brighten you up a bit,\" said the\ngoverness affably as they drove: she was in great good-humour at the\nprospect of losing sight for a time of the fifty-five. \"You seem to be\nalways in the dumps nowadays.\"\n\nLaura dutifully waved her handkerchief from the deck of the SILVER\nSTAR; and the paddles began to churn. As Miss Snodgrass's back\nretreated down the pier, and the breach between ship and land widened,\nshe settled herself on her seat with a feeling of immense relief. At\nlast--at last she was off. The morning had been a sore trial to her: in\nall the noisy and effusive leave-taking, she was odd man out; no one\nhad been sorry to part from her; no one had extracted a promise that\nshe would write. Her sole valediction had been a minatory shaft from\nMaria: if she valued her skin, to learn to stop telling crams before\nshe showed up there again. Now, she was free of them; she would not be\nhumiliated afresh, would not need to stand eye to eye with anyone who\nknew of her disgrace, for weeks to come; perhaps never again, if Mother\nagreed. Her heart grew momentarily lighter. And the farther they left\nMelbourne behind them, the higher her spirits rose.\n\nBut then, too, was it possible, on this radiant December day, long to\nremain in what Miss Snodgrass had called \"the dumps\"?--The sea was a\nblue-green mirror, on the surface of which they swam. The sky was a\nstretched sheet of blue, in which the sun hung a very ball of fire. But\nthe steamer cooled the air as it moved; and none of the white-clad\npeople who, under the stretched white awnings, thronged the deck, felt\noppressed by the great heat. In the middle of the deck, a brass band\nplayed popular tunes.\n\nAt a pretty watering-place where they stopped, Laura rose and crossed\nto the opposite railing. A number of passengers went ashore, pushing\nand laughing, but almost as many more came on board, all dressed in\nwhite, and with eager, animated faces. Then the boat stood to sea again\nand sailed past high, grass-grown cliffs, from which a few old cannons,\npointing their noses at you, watched over the safety of the Bay--in the\nevent, say, of the Japanese or the Russians entering the Heads past the\npretty township, and the beflagged bathing-enclosures on the beach\nbelow. They neared the tall, granite lighthouse at the point, with the\nflagstaff at its side where incoming steamers were signalled; and as\nsoon as they had rounded this corner they were in view of the Heads\nthemselves. From the distant cliffs there ran out, on either side,\nbrown reefs, which made the inrushing water dance and foam, and the\nentrance to the Bay narrow and dangerous: on one side, there projected\nthe portion of a wreck which had lain there as long as Laura had been\nin the world. Then, having made a sharp turn to the left, the boat\ncrossed to the opposite coast, and steamed past barrack-like buildings\nlying asleep in the fierce sunshine of the afternoon; and, in due\ncourse, it stopped at Laura's destination.\n\nOld Anne was waiting on the jetty, having hitched the horse to a post:\nshe had driven in, in the 'shandrydan', to meet Laura. For the cottage\nwas not on the front beach, with the hotels and boarding-houses, the\nfenced-in baths and great gentle slope of yellow sand: it stood in the\nbush, on the back beach, which gave to the open sea.\n\nLaura took her seat beside the old woman in her linen sunbonnet, the\nbody of the vehicle being packed full of groceries and other stores;\nand the drive began. Directly they were clear of the township the road\nas good as ceased, became a mere sandy track, running through a scrub\nof ti-trees.--And what sand! White, dry, sliding sand, through which\nthe horse shuffled and floundered, in which the wheels sank and stuck.\nHad one of the many hillocks to be taken, the two on the box-seat\ninstinctively threw their weight forward; old Anne, who had a stripped\nwattle-bough for a whip, urged and cajoled; and more than once she\nhanded Laura the reins and got down, to give the horse a pull. They had\nalways to be ducking their heads, too, to let the low ti-tree branches\nsweep over their backs.\n\nAbout a couple of miles out, the old woman alighted and slipped a rail;\nand having passed the only other house within cooee, they drove through\na paddock, but at a walking-pace, because of the thousands of\nrabbit-burrows that perforated the ground. Another slip-rail lowered,\nthey drew up at the foot of a steepish hill, beside a sandy little\nvegetable garden, a shed and a pump. The house was perched on the top\nof the hill, and directly they sighted it they also saw Pin flying\ndown, her sunbonnet on her neck.\n\n\"Laura, Laura! Oh, I AM glad you've come. What a time you've been!\"\n\n\"Hullo, Pin.--Oh, I say, let me get out first.\"\n\n\"And pull up your bonnet, honey. D'you want to be after gettin'\nsunstruck?\"\n\nGlad though Laura was to see her sister again, she did not manage to\ninfuse a very hearty tone into her greeting; for her first glimpse of\nPin had given her a disagreeable shock. It was astonishing, the change\nthe past half-year had worked in the child; and as the two climbed the\nhill together, to the accompaniment of Pin's bubbly talk, Laura stole\nlook after look at her little sister, in the hope of growing used to\nwhat she saw. Pin had never been pretty, but now she was \"downright\nhideous\"--as Laura phrased it to herself. Eleven years of age, she had\nat last begun to grow in earnest: her legs were as of old mere\nspindleshanks, but nearly twice as long; and her fat little body,\nperched above them, made one think of a shrivelled-up old man who has\nrun all to paunch. Her face, too, had increased in shapelessness, the\nfeatures being blurred in the fat mass; her blue eyes were more\nslit-like than before; and, to cap everything, her fine skin had\nabsolutely no chance, so bespattered was it with freckles. And none of\nyour pretty little sun-kisses; but large, black, irregular freckles\nthat disfigured like moles. Laura felt quite distressed; it outraged\nher feelings that anyone belonging to her should be so ugly; and as\nPin, in happy ignorance of her sister's reflections, chattered on,\nLaura turned over in her mind what she ought to do. She would have to\ntell Pin about herself--that was plain: she must break the news to her,\nin case others should do it, and more cruelly. It was one consolation\nto know that Pin was not sensitive about her looks; so long as you did\nnot tease her about her legs, there was no limit to what you might say\nto her: the grieving was all for the onlooker. But not today: this was\nthe first day; and there were pleasanter things to think of. And so,\nwhen they had had tea--with condensed milk in it, for the cow had gone\ndry, and no milkman came out so far--when tea was over--and that was\nall that could be undertaken in the way of refreshment after the\njourney; washing your face and hands, for instance, was out of the\nquestion; every drop of water had to be carried up the hill from the\npump, and old Anne purposely kept the ewers empty by day; if you WOULD\nwash, you must wash in the sea--as soon, then, as tea was over, the two\nsisters made for the beach.\n\nThe four-roomed, weatherboard cottage, to which at a later date a\nlean-to had been added, faced the bush: from the verandah there was a\nwide view of the surrounding country. Between the back of the house and\nthe beach rose a huge sand-hill, sparsely grown with rushes and coarse\ngrass. It took you some twenty minutes to toil over this, and boots and\nstockings were useless impedimenta; for the sand was once more of that\nloose and shifting kind in which you sank at times up to the knees,\nfalling back one step for every two you climbed. But then, sand was the\nprevailing note of this free and easy life: it bestrewed verandah and\nfloors; you carried it in your clothes; the beds were full of it; it\neven got into the food; and you were soon so accustomed to its presence\nthat you missed the grit of it under foot, or the prickling on your\nskin, did old Anne happen to take a broom in her hand, or thoroughly\nre-make the beds.--When, however, on your way to the beach you had\nlaboriously attained the summit of the great dune, the sight that met\nyou almost took your breath away: as far as the eye could reach, the\nbluest of skies melting into the bluest of seas, which broke its\nfoam-flecked edge against the flat, brown reefs that fringed the shore.\nThen, downhill--with a trip and a flounder that sent the sand\nman-high--and at last you were on what Laura and Pin thought the most\nwonderful beach in the world. What a variety of things was there!\nWhitest, purest sand, hot to the touch as a zinc roof in summer; rocky\ncaves, and sandy caves hung with crumbly stalactites; at low tide, on\nthe reef, lakes and ponds and rivers deep enough to make it unnecessary\nfor you to go near the ever-angry surf at all; seaweeds that ran\nthrough the gamut of colours: brown and green, pearl-pink and\ncoral-pink, to vivid scarlet and orange; shells, beginning with tiny\ngrannies and cowries, and ending with the monsters in which the\nbreakers had left their echo; the bones of cuttlefish, light as paper,\nand shaped like javelins. And, what was best of all, this beach\nbelonged to them alone; they had not to share its treasures with\nstrangers; except the inhabitants of the cottage, never a soul set foot\nupon it.\n\nThe chief business of the morning was to bathe. If the girls were alone\nand the tide full, they threw off their clothes and ran into a sandy,\nshallow pool, where the water never came above their waists, and where\nit was safe to let the breakers dash over them. But if the tide were\nlow, the boys bathed, too, and then Pin and Laura tied themselves up in\nold bathing-gowns that were too big for them, and all went in a body to\nthe \"Half-Moon Hole\". This pool, which was about twenty feet long and\nten to fifteen deep, lay far out on the reef, and, at high tide, was\nhidden beneath surf and foam; at low water, on the other hand, it was\nlike a glass mirror reflecting the sky, and so clear that you could see\nevery weed that waved at the bottom. Having cast off your shoes, you\napplied your soles gingerly to the prickles of the rock; then\nplop!--and in you went. Pin often needed a shove from behind, for\nnowhere, of course, could you get a footing; but Laura swam with the\nbest. Some of the boys would dive to the bottom and bring up weeds and\nshells, but Laura and Pin kept on the surface of the water; for they\nhad the imaginative dread common to children who know the sea well--the\ndread of what may lurk beneath the thick, black horrors of seaweed.\n\nThen, after an hour or so in the water, home to dinner, hungry as\nswagmen, though the bill of fare never varied: it was always rabbit for\ndinner, crayfish for tea; for the butcher called only once a week, and\nmeat could not be kept an hour without getting flyblown. The rabbits\nwere skinned and in the stew-pot before they were cold; the crayfish\ndied an instant death: one that drove the blood to Laura's head, and\nmade Pin run away and cry, with her fingers to her ears; for she\nbelieved the sizzling of the water, as the fish were dropped in, to be\nthe shriek of the creatures in their death-agony.\n\nExcept in bathing, the girls saw little of the boys. Both were afraid\nof guns, so did not go out on the expeditions which supplied the\ndinner-table; and old Anne would not allow them to join the crayfishing\nexcursions. For these took place by night, off the end of the reef,\nwith nets and torches; and it sometimes happened, if the surf were\nheavy, that one of the fishers was washed off the rocks, and only\nhauled up again with considerable difficulty.\n\nLaura took her last peep at the outside world, every evening, in the\nbrief span of time between sunset and dark. Running up to the top of\none of the hills, and letting her eyes range over sky and sea, she\nwould drink in the scents that were waking to life after the burning\nheat of the day: salt water, warmed sand and seaweeds, ti-scrub,\nsour-grass, and the sturdy berry-bushes, high as her knee, through\nwhich she had ploughed her way. That was one of the moments she liked\nbest, that, and lying in bed at night listening to the roar of the\nsurf, which went on and on like a cannonade, even though the hill lay\nbetween. It made her flesh crawl, too, in delightful fashion, did she\npicture to herself how alone she and Pin were, in their room: the boys\nslept in the lean-to on the other side of the kitchen; old Anne at the\nback. For miles round, no house broke the solitude of the bush; only a\nthin wooden partition separated her from possible bushrangers, from the\nvastness and desolation of the night, the eternal booming of the sea.\n\nSuch was the life into which Laura now threw herself heart and soul,\nforgetting, in the sheer joy of living, her recent tribulation.\n\nBut even the purest pleasures WILL pall; and after a time, when the\nbloom had worn off and the newness and her mind was more at leisure\nagain, she made some disagreeable discoveries which ruffled her\ntranquillity.\n\nIt was Pin, poor, fat, little well-meaning Pin, who did the mischief\n\nPin was not only changed in looks; her character had changed, too; and\nin so marked a way that before a week was out the sisters were at\nloggerheads. Each day made it plainer to Laura that Pin was developing\na sturdy independence; she had ceased to look up to Laura as a prodigy\nof wisdom, and had begun to hold opinions of her own. She was, indeed,\neven disposed to be critical of her sister; and criticism from this\nquarter was more than Laura could brook: it was just as if a slave\nusurped his master's rights. At first speechless with surprise, she\nended by losing her temper; the more, because Pin was prone to be\nmulish, and could not be got to budge, either by derision or by scorn,\nfrom her espoused views. They were those of the school at which for the\npast half-year she had been a day-pupil, and seemed to her\nunassailable. Laura found them ridiculous, as she did much else about\nPin at this time: her ugliness, her setting herself up as an authority:\nand she jeered unkindly whenever Pin came out with them.--A still more\nludicrous thing was that, despite her plainness, Pin actually had an\nadmirer. True, she did not say so outright; perhaps she was not even\naware of it; but Laura gathered from her talk that a boy at her school,\na boy some three years older than herself, had given her a silk\nhandkerchief and liked to help her with her sums.--And to Laura this\nwas the most knockdown blow of all.\n\nOne day it came to an open quarrel between them.\n\nThey were lying on the beach after bathing, trying to protect their\nbare and blistered legs from the sandflies. Laura, flat on her back,\nhad spread a towel over hers; Pin sat Turk--fashion with her legs\nbeneath her and fought the flies with her hands. Having vainly\nendeavoured to draw from the reticent Laura some of those school-tales\nof which, in former holidays, she had been so prodigal, Pin was now\nchattering to her heart's content, about the small doings of home.\nLaura listened to her with the impatient toleration of one who has seen\nthe world: she really could not be expected to interest herself in such\ntrifles; and she laughed in her sleeve at Pin's simpleness. When,\nhowever, her little sister began to enlarge anew on some wonderful\norders Mother had lately had, she could not refrain from saying\ncrossly: \"You've told me that a dozen times already. And you needn't\nbawl it out for everyone to hear.\"\n\n\"Oh, Laura! there isn't anyone anywhere near us ... and even if there\nwere--why, I thought you'd be so pleased. Mother's going to give you an\nextra shilling pocket-money, 'cause of it.\"\n\n\"Of course I'm pleased. Don't be so silly, Pin.\"\n\n\"I'm not ALWAYS silly, Laura,\" protested Pin. \"And I don't believe you\nARE glad, a bit. Old Anne was, though. She said: 'Bless her dear\nheart!'\"\n\n\"Old Anne? Well, I just wonder what next! It's none of her dashed\nbusiness.\"\n\n\"Oh, Laura!\" began Pin, growing tearful both at words and tone. \"Why,\nLaura, you're not ashamed of it, are you?--that mother does\nsewing?\"--and Pin opened her lobelia-blue eyes to their widest, showing\nwhat very big eyes they would be, were they not so often swollen with\ncrying.\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Laura tartly. \"But I'm blessed if I can see what\nit's got to do with old Anne.\"\n\n\"But she asked me ... what mother was working at--and if she'd got any\nnew customers. She just loves mother.\"\n\n\"Like her cheek!\" snapped Laura. \"Poking her ugly old nose into what\ndoesn't concern her. You should just have said you didn't know.\"\n\n\"But that would have been a story, Laura!\" cried Pin, horrified \"I did\nknow--quite well.\"\n\n\"Goodness gracious, Pin, you----\"\n\n\"I've never told a story in my life,\" said Pin hotly. \"And I'm not\ngoing to either, for you or anyone. I think you ought to be ashamed of\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Hold your silly tongue!\"\n\n\"I shan't, Laura. And I think you're very wicked. You're not a bit like\nwhat you used to be. And it's all going to school that's done\nit--Mother says it is.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't be such a blooming ass!\" and Laura, stung to the quick,\nretaliated by taunting Pin with the change that had come to pass in her\nappearance. To her surprise, she found Pin grown inordinately touchy\nabout her looks: at Laura's brutal statement of the truth she cried\nbitterly.\n\n\"I'm not, no, I'm not! I haven't got a full moon for a face! It's no\nfatter than yours. Sarah said last time you were home how fat you were\ngetting.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I'm not,\" said Laura, indignant in her turn.\n\n\"Yes, you are,\" sobbed Pin. \"But you only think other people are ugly,\nnot yourself I'll tell mother what you've said as soon as ever I get\nhome. And I'll tell her, too, you want to make me tell stories. And\nthat I'm sure you've done something naughty at school, 'cause you won't\never talk about it. And how you're always saying bad words like\nblooming and gosh and golly--yes, I will!\"\n\n\"You were always a sneak and a tell-tale.\"\n\n\"And you were always a greedy, selfish, deceitful thing.\"\n\n\"You don't know anything about me, you numbskull, you!\"\n\n\"I don't want to! I know you're a bad, wicked girl.\"\n\nAfter this exchange of home truths, they did not speak to each other\nfor two days: Pin had a temper that smouldered, and could not easily\nforgive. So she stayed at old Anne's side, helping to bake scones and\nleatherjackets; or trotted after the boys, who had dropped into the way\nof saying: \"Come on, little Pin!\" as they never said: \"Come on, Laura!\"\nand Laura retired in lonely dudgeon to the beach.\n\nShe took the estrangement so much to heart that she eased her feelings\nby abusing Pin in thought; Pin was a pig-headed little ignoramus, as\ntimid as ever of setting one foot before the other. And the rest of\nthem would be just the same--old stick-in-the muds, unchanged by a\nhair, or, if they HAD changed, then changed for the worse. Laura had\nsomehow never foreseen the day on which she would find herself out of\ntune with her home circle; with unthinking assurance she had expected\nthat Pin, for instance, would always be eager to keep pace with her.\nNow, she saw that her little sister would probably never catch up to\nher again. Such progress as Pin might make--if she were not already\nglued firm to her silly notions--would be in quite another direction.\nFor the quarrel had made one thing plain to Laura: with regard to her\ntroubles, she need not look to Pin for sympathy: if Pin talked such\ngibberish at the hint of putting off an inquisitive old woman, what\nwould she--and not she alone--what would they all say to the tissue of\nlies Laura had spun round Mr. Shepherd, a holy man, a clergyman, and a\npersonal friend of Mother's into the bargain? She could not blink the\nfact that, did it come to their ears, they would call her in earnest,\nwhat Pin had called her in her temper--bad and wicked. Home was, alas!\nno longer the snug nest in which she was safe from the slings and\nshanghais of the world.\n\nAnd then there was another thing: did she stay at home, she would have\nto re-live herself into the thousand and one gimcrack concerns, which\nnow, as set forth by Pin, so bored her: the colic Leppie had brought on\nby eating unripe fruit; the fact that another of Sarah's teeth had\ndropped out without extraneous aid. It was all very well for a week or\ntwo, but, at the idea of shutting herself wholly up with such mopokes,\nof cutting herself off from her present vital interests, Laura hastily\nreconsidered her decision to leave school. No: badly as she had\nsuffered at her companions' hands, much as she dreaded returning, it\nwas at school she belonged. All her heart was there: in the doings of\nher equals, the things that really mattered--who would be promoted, who\nprefect, whose seat changed in the dining-hall.--Besides, could one who\nhad experienced the iron rule of Mr. Strachey, or Mrs. Gurley, ever be\ncontent to go back and just form one of a family of children? She not,\nat any rate!\n\nThus she lay, all day long, her hands clasped under her neck, a small\nwhite speck on the great wave-lapped beach. She watched the surf break,\nwatched the waves creep up and hide the reef, watched the gulls vanish\nin the sun-saturated blue overhead. Sometimes she rose to her elbow to\nfollow a ship just inside the horizon; and it pleased her to think that\nthis great boat was sailing off, with a load of lucky mortals, to some\nunknown, fairer world, while she, a poor Cinderella, had to stop\nbehind--even though she knew it was only the English mail going on to\nSydney. Of Pin she preferred not to think; nor could she dwell with\nequanimity on her late misfortunes at school and the trials that\nawaited her on her reappearance; and since she HAD to think of\nsomething, she fell into the habit of making up might-have-been, of\nnarrating to herself how things would have fallen out had her fictions\nbeen fact, her ascetic hero the impetuous lover she had made of\nhim.--In other words, lying prostrate on the sand, Laura went on with\nher story.\n\nWhen, towards the end of the third week, she and Pin were summoned to\nspend some days with Godmother, she had acquired such a gusto for this\noccupation, that she preferred to shirk reality, and let Pin pay the\nvisit alone.\n\n\n\n\nXX.\n\n\nWIE SOLLTE EIN STROM NICHT ENDLICH DEN WEG ZUM MEERE FINDEN!\n\nNIETZSCHE\n\n\nSea, sun and air did their healing work, as did also the long, idle\ndays in the home garden; and Laura drank in health and vigour with\nevery breath.\n\nShe had need of it all when, the golden holidays over, she returned to\nschool; for the half-year that broke was, in many ways, the most trying\nshe had yet had to face. True, her dupes' first virulence had\nwaned--they no longer lashed her openly with their tongues--but the\nquiet, covert insults, that were now the rule, were every bit as hard\nto bear; and before a week had passed Laura was telling herself that,\nhad she been a Christian Martyr, she would have preferred to be torn\nasunder with one jerk, rather than submit to the thumbkin. Not an eye\nbut looked askance at her; on every face was painted a reminder of her\nmoral inferiority; and even newcomers among the boarders soon learnt,\nwithout always knowing what her crime had been, that Laura Rambotham\nwas \"not the thing\".\n\nThis system of slight and disparagement was similar to what she had had\nto endure in her first school term; but its effect upon her was\ndifferent. Then, in her raw timidity, she had bowed her head beneath\nit; now, she could not be so lamb-like. In thought, she never ceased to\nlay half the blame of what had happened on her companions' shoulders;\nand she was embittered by their injustice in making her alone\nresponsible, when all she had done was to yield to their craving for\nromance. She became a rebel, wrapping herself round in the cloak of\nbitterness which the outcasts of fortune wear, feeding on her hate of\nthose within the pale. Very well then, she said to herself: if her\nfellows chose to shut her out like this, she would stop outside, and\nnever see eye to eye with them again. And it gave her an unholy\npleasure to mock, in secret, at all they set store by.\n\nHer outward behaviour for many a day was, none the less, that of a\nfootlicker; and by no sign did she indicate what she really was--a very\nunhappy girl. Like most rebels of her sex, she ardently desired to\nre-enter the fold of law and order; and it was to this end she worked,\nalthough, wherever she approached it, the place seemed to bristle with\nspears. But she did not let herself be daunted; she pocketed injuries,\npretended not to hear them, played the spaniel to people she despised;\nand it soon became open talk, that no matter what you said to her,\nLaura Rambotham would not take offence. You could also rely on her to\ndo a dirty job for you.--A horrid little toady was the verdict;\nespecially of those who had no objection to be toadied to.\n\nTorn thus, between mutinous sentiments on the one hand, a longing for\nrestitution on the other, Laura grew very sly--a regular little\ntactician. In these days, she was for ever considering what she ought\nto do, what to leave undone. She learnt to weigh her words before\nuttering them, instead of blurting out her thoughts in the childish\nfashion that had exposed her to ridicule; she learnt, too, at last, to\nkeep her real opinions to herself, and to make those she expressed\ntally with her hearers'. And she was quick to discover that this was a\nshort-cut towards regaining her lost place: to conceal what she truly\nfelt--particularly if her feelings ran counter to those of the\nmajority. For, the longer she was at school, the more insistently the\ntruth was driven home to her, that the majority is always in the right.\n\nIn the shifting of classes that took place at the year's end, she left\nthe three chief witnesses of her disgrace--Tilly, Maria, Kate--behind\nher. She was again among a new set of girls. But this little piece of\nluck was outweighed by the fact that, shortly after Christmas, her room\nwas changed for the one occupied by M. P., and M. P.'s best friend.\n\nSo far, Laura had hardly dared to lift her eyes in Mary Pidwall's\npresence. For Mary knew not only the sum of her lies, but also held--or\nso Laura believed--that she came of a thoroughly degenerate family;\nthanks to Uncle Tom. And the early weeks spent at close quarters with\nher bore out these fears. The looks both M. P. and her friend bent on\nLaura said as plainly as words: if we are forced to tolerate this\nobnoxious little insect about us, we can at least show it just what a\nhorrid little beast it is.--M. P. in particular was adamant,\nunrelenting; Laura quailed at the sound of her step.\n\nAnd yet she soon felt, rightly enough, it was just in the winning over\nof this stern, rigid nature that her hope of salvation lay. If she\ncould once get M. P. on her side, all might yet be well again.\n\nSo she began to lay siege to Mary's good-will--to Mary, who took none\nbut the barest notice of her, even in the bedroom ignoring her as if\nshe did not exist, and giving the necessary orders, for she was the\neldest of the three, in tones of ice. But it needed a great wariness on\nLaura's part. And, in the beginning, she made a mistake. She was a\ntoadeater here, too, seeking to curry favour with M. P. as with the\nrest, by fawning on her, in a way for which she could afterwards have\nhit herself. For it did not answer; M. P. had only a double disdain for\nthe cringer, knowing nothing herself of the pitfalls that lie in wait\nfor a temperament like Laura's. Mary's friendship was extended to none\nbut those who had a lofty moral standard; and truthfulness and honesty\nwere naturally the head virtues on her list. Laura was sharp enough to\nsee that, if she wished to gain ground with M. P. she must make a\nradical change in her tactics. It was not enough, where Mary was in\nquestion, to play the echo. Did she, Laura, state an opinion, she must\nsay what she meant, above all, mean what she said, and stick manfully\nto it, instead of, at the least hint, being ready to fly over to Mary's\npoint of view: always though, of course, with the disquieting proviso\nin the background that her own opinions were such as she ought to have,\nand not heretical leanings that shocked and dismayed. In which case,\nthere was nothing for it but to go on being mum.\n\nShe ventured, moreover, little unobtrusive services, to which she\nthought neither of the girls could take exception; making their beds\nfor them in the morning, and staying up last at night to put out the\nlight. And once she overheard the friend, who was called Cupid, say:\n\"You know, M. P., she's not such a bad little stick after all.\"--But\nthen Cupid was easy-going, and inclined to be original.\n\nMay answered: \"She's no doubt beginning to see she can't lie to US. But\nshe's a very double-faced child.\"\n\nIt was also with an eye to M. P.'s approval that Laura threw herself,\nwith renewed zeal, upon her work. And in those classes that called only\nfor the exercise of her memory, she soon sat high. The reason why she\ncould not mount still higher was that M. P. occupied the top place, and\nwas not to be moved, even had Laura dreamed of attempting it.\n\nAnd at length, after three months of unremitting exertion in the course\nof which, because she had little peeps of what looked like success, the\nrebel in her went to sleep again--at length Laura had her reward. One\nSunday morning M. P. asked her to be her partner on the walk to church.\nThis was as if a great poet should bend from his throne to take a\nyounger brother-singer by the hand; and, in her headlong fashion, Laura\nall but fell at the elder girl's feet. From this day forward she\nout-heroded Herod, in her efforts to make of herself exactly what Mary\nthought she ought to be.\n\nDeep within her, none the less, there lurked a feeling which sometimes\nmade as if to raise its head: a feeling that she did not really like M.\nP., or admire her, or respect her; one which, had it come quite to\nlife, would have kicked against Mary's authority, been contemptuous of\nher unimaginative way of seeing and saying things, on the alert to\nremind its owner that HER way, too, had a right to existence. But is\nwas not strong enough to make itself heard, or rather Laura refused to\nhear it, and turned a deaf ear whenever it tried to hint at its\npresence.--For Mr. Worldly-Wiseman was her model just now.\n\nWhereas Cupid--there was something in Cupid that was congenial to her.\nA plain girl, with irregular features--how she had come by her nickname\nno one knew--Cupid was three years older than Laura, and one of the few\nin the school who loved reading for its own sake. In a manner, she was\ncleverer even than M. P.; but it was not a school-booky way, and hence\nwas not thought much of. However, Laura felt drawn to her at once--even\nthough Cupid treated her as quite a little girl--and they sometimes got\nas far as talking of books they had read. From this whiff of her, Laura\nwas sure that Cupid would have had more understanding than M. P. for\nher want of veracity; for Cupid had a kind of a dare-devil mind in a\nhidebound character, and was often very bold of speech.\n\nYet it was not Cupid's good opinion she worked for, with might and main.\n\nThe rate of her upward progress in Mary's estimation could be gauged by\nthe fact that the day came when the elder girl spoke openly to her of\nher crime. At the first merciless words Laura winced hotly, both at and\nfor the tactlessness of which Mary was guilty. But, the first shameful\nstab over, she felt the better of it; yes, it was a relief to speak to\nsome one of what she had borne alone for so long. To speak of it, and\neven to argue round it a little; for, like most wrongdoers, Laura soon\nacquired a taste for dwelling on her misdeed. And Mary, being entirely\nwithout humour, and also unversed in dealing with criminals, did not\ndivine that this was just a form of self-indulgence. It was Cupid who\nsaid: \"Look here, Infant, you'll be getting cocky about what you did,\nif you don't look out.\"\n\nMary would not allow that a single one of Laura's excuses held water.\n\n\"That's the sheerest nonsense. You don't seem to realise that you tried\nto defame another person's moral character,\" she said, in the assured,\nsuperior way that so impressed Laura.--And this aspect of the case,\nwhich had never once occurred to her, left Laura open-mouthed; and yet\na little doubtful: Mr. Shepherd was surely too far above her, and too\nsafely ensconced in holiness, to be injured by anything she might say.\nBut the idea gave her food for thought; and she even tentatively\ndeveloped her story along these unfamiliar lines, just to see how it\nmight have turned out.\n\nOne night as they were undressing for bed, Mary spoke, with the same\nfireless depreciation, of the behaviour of a classmate which had been\nbrought to her notice that day. This girl was said to have nefariously\n\"copied\" from another, in the course of a written examination; and, as\nprefect of her class Mary was bound to track the evil down. \"I shall\nmake them both show me their papers as soon as they get them back; and\nthen, if I find proof of what's being said, I must tackle her. Just as\nI tackled you, Laura.\"\n\nLaura flushed. \"Oh, M. P., I've never 'copied' in my life!\" she cried.\n\n\"Probably not. But those things all belong in the same box: lying, and\n'copying', and stealing.\"\n\n\"You never WILL believe me when I say I didn't know anything about that\nhorrid Chinky. I only told a few crams--that was quite different.\"\n\n\"I think it's most unfortunate, Laura, that you persist in clinging to\nthat idea.\"\n\nHere M. P. was obliged to pause; for she had put a lock of hair between\nher teeth while she did something to a plait at the back. As soon as\nshe could speak again, she went on: \"You and your few crams! Have you\never thought, pray, what a state of things it would be, if we all went\nabout telling false-hoods, and saying it didn't matter, they were\nmerely a few little fibs?--What are you laughing at?\"\n\n\"I'm not laughing. I mean ... I just smiled. I was only thinking how\nfunny it would be--Sandy, and old Gurley, and Jim Chapman, all going\nround making up things that had never happened.\"\n\n\"You've a queer notion of what's funny. Have you utterly no respect for\nthe truth?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course I have. But I say\"--Laura, who always slipped quickly\nout of her clothes, was sitting in her nightgown on the edge of the\nbed, hugging her knees. \"I say, M. P., if everybody told stories, and\neverybody knew everybody else was telling them, then truth wouldn't be\nany good any more at all, would it? If nobody used it?\"\n\n\"What rubbish you do talk!\" said Mary serenely, as she shook her\ntoothbrush on to a towel and rubbed it dry.\n\n\"As if truth were a soap!\" remarked Cupid who was already in bed,\nreading NANA, and trying to smoke a cigarette under the blankets.\n\n\"You can't do away with truth, child.\"\n\n\"But why not? Who says so? It isn't a law.\"\n\n\"Don't try to be so sharp, Laura.\"\n\n\"I don't mean to, M. P.--But what IS truth, anyhow?\" asked Laura.\n\n\"The Bible is truth. Can you do away with the Bible, pray?\"\n\n\"Of course not. But M. P.... The Bible isn't quite all truth, you know.\nMy father----\" here she broke off in some confusion, remembering Uncle\nTom.\n\n\"Well, what about him? You don't want to say, I hope, that he didn't\nbelieve in the Bible?\"\n\nLaura drove back the: \"Of course not!\" that was all but over her lips.\n\"Well, not exactly,\" she said, and grew very red. \"But you KNOW, M. P.,\nwhales don't have big enough throats ever to have swallowed Jonah.\"\n\n\"Little girls shouldn't talk about what they don't understand. The\nBible is God's Word; and God is Truth.\"\n\n\"You're a silly infant,\" threw in Cupid, coughing as she spoke. \"Truth\nhas got to be--and honesty, too. If it didn't exist, there couldn't be\nany state, or laws, or any social life. It's one of the things that\nmakes men different from animals, and the people who boss us know\npretty well what they're about, you bet when they punish the ruffians\nwho don't practise it.\"\n\n\"Yes, now THAT I see,\" agreed Laura eagerly. \"Then truth's a useful\nthing.--Oh, and that's probably what it means, too, when you say:\nHonesty is the best Policy.\"\n\n\"I never heard such a child,\" said M. P., shocked. \"Cupid, you really\nshouldn't put such things into her head.--You're down-right immoral,\nLaura.\"\n\n\"Oh, how CAN you say such a horrid thing?\"\n\n\"Well, your ideas are simply dreadful. You ought to try your hardest to\nimprove them.\"\n\n\"I do, M. P., really I do.\"\n\n\"You don't succeed. I think there must be a screw loose in you\nsomewhere.\"\n\n\"Anyhow, I vote we adjourn this meeting,\" said Cupid, recovering from a\nfresh cough and splutter. \"Or old Gurley'll be coming in to put me on a\nmustard plaster.--As for you, Infant, if you take the advice of a chap\nwho has seen life, you'll keep your ideas to yourself: they're too\ncrude for this elegant world.\"\n\n\"Right you are!\" said Laura cheerfully.\n\nShe was waiting by the gas-jet till M.P. had folded her last garment,\nand she shuffled her bare feet one over the other as she stood; for it\nwas a cold night. The light out, she hopped into bed in the dark.\n\n\n\n\nXXI.\n\n\nBut the true seal was set on her regeneration when she was invited to\njoin the boarders' Literary Society; of which Cupid and Mary were the\nleading spirits. This carried her back, at one stroke, into the swing\nof school life. For everybody who was anybody belonged to the society.\nAnd, despite her friendship with the head of her class, Laura still\nknew what it was to get the cold shoulder.\n\nBut this was to some extent her own fault. At the present stage of her\ncareer she was an extraordinarily prickly child, and even to her two\nsponsors did not at times present a very amiable outside: like a\nhedgehog, she was ever ready to shoot out her spines. With regard, that\nis, to her veracity. She had been so badly grazed, in her recent\nencounter, that she was now constantly seeing doubt where no doubt was;\nand this wakeful attitude of suspicion towards others did not make for\nbrotherly love. The amenity of her manners suffered, too: though she\nkept to her original programme of not saying all she thought, yet what\nshe was forced to say she blurted out in such a precise and blunt\nfashion that it made a disagreeable impression. At the same time, a\ngrowing pedantry in trifles warped both her imagination and her\nsympathies: under the aegis of M. P., she rapidly learned to be the\nlatter's rival in an adherence to bald fact, and in her contumely for\nthose who departed from it. Indeed, before the year spent in Mary's\ncompany was out, Laura was well on the way towards becoming one of\nthose uncomfortable people who, concerned only for their own salvation,\nfire the truth at you on every occasion, without regard for your tender\nplaces.--So she remained but scantly popular.\n\nHence, her admission to the Literary Society augured well.\n\nHer chief qualifications for membership were that she could make\nverses, and was also very fond of reading. At school, however, this\ntaste had been quiescent; for books were few. Still, she had read\nwhatever she could lay hands on, and for the past half-year or more she\nhad fared like a little pig in a clover field. Since Christmas, she was\none of the few permitted to do morning practice on the grand piano in\nMrs. Strachey's drawing-room--an honour, it is true, not overmuch\nvalued by its recipients, for Mrs. Gurley's bedroom lay just above, and\nthat lady could swoop down on whoever was weak enough to take a little\nrest. But Laura snapped her fingers at such a flimsy objection; for\nthis was the wonderful room round the walls of which low, open\nbookshelves ran; and she was soon bold enough, on entering, hastily to\nselect a book to read while she played, always on the alert to pop it\nbehind her music, should anyone come into the room.\n\nFor months, she browsed unchecked. As her choice had to be made with\nextreme celerity, and from those shelves nearest the piano, it was in\nthe nature of things that it was not invariably a happy one. For some\ntime she had but moderate luck, and sampled queer foods. To these must\nbe reckoned a translation of FAUST, which she read through, to the end\nof the First Part at least, with a kind of dreary wonder why such a\ndull thing should be called great. For her next repast, she sought hard\nand it was in the course of this rummage that she had the strangest\nfind of all. Running a skilled eye over the length of a shelf close at\nhand, she hit on a slim, blue volume, the title of which at once\narrested her attention. For, notwithstanding her fourteen years, and\nher dabblings in Richardson and Scott, Laura's liking for a real\nchild's book was as strong as it had ever been; and A DOLL'S HOUSE\nseemed to promise good things. Deftly extracting the volume, she struck\nup her scales and began to read.\n\nThis was the day on which, after breakfast, Mrs. Gurley pulverised her\nwith the remark: \"A new, and, I must say, extremely interesting,\nfashion of playing scales, Laura Rambotham! To hold, the forte pedal\ndown, from beginning to end!\"\n\nLaura was unconscious of having sinned in this way. But it might quite\nwell be so. For she had spent a topsy-turvy, though highly engrossing\nhour. In place of the children's story she anticipated, she had found\nherself, on opening the book, confronted by the queerest stuff she had\never seen in print. From the opening sentence on. To begin with, it was\na play--and Laura had never had a modern prose play in her hand\nbefore--and then it was all about the oddest, yet the most commonplace\npeople. It seemed to her amazingly unreal--how these people spoke and\nbehaved--she had never known anyone like them; and yet again so true,\nin the way it dragged in everyday happenings, so petty in its rendering\nof petty things, that it bewildered and repelled her: why, some one\nmight just as well write a book about Mother or Sarah! Her young,\nromantic soul rose in arms against this, its first bluff contact with\nrealism, against such a dispiriting sobriety of outlook. Something\nwithin her wanted to cry out in protest as she read--for read she did,\non three successive days, with an interest she could not explain. And\nthat was not all. It was worse that the people in this book--the\nextraordinary person who was married, and had children, and yet ate\nbiscuits out of a bag and said she didn't; the man who called her his\nlark and his squirrel--as if any man ever did call his wife such\nnames!--all these people seemed eternally to be meaning something\ndifferent from what they said; something that was for ever eluding her.\nIt was most irritating.-- There was, moreover, no mention of a doll's\nhouse in the whole three acts.\n\nThe state of confusion this booklet left her in, she allayed with a\nlittle old brown leather volume of Longfellow. And HYPERION was so much\nmore to her liking that she even ventured to borrow it from its place\non the shelf, in order to read it at her leisure, braving the chance\nthat her loan, were it discovered, might be counted against her as a\ntheft.\n\nIt hung together, no doubt, with the after-effects of her dip into\nIbsen that, on her sitting down to write the work that was to form her\npassport to the Society, her mind should incline to the most romantic\nof romantic themes. Not altogether, though: Laura's taste, such as it\nwas, for literature had, like all young people's, a mighty bias towards\nthose books which turned their backs on reality: she sought not truth,\nbut the miracle. However, though she had thus taken sides, there was\nstill a yawning gap to be bridged between her ready acceptance of the\nhonourable invitation, and the composition of a masterpiece. Thanks to\nher wonted inability to project her thoughts beyond the moment, she had\nbeen so unthinking of possible failure that Cupid had found it\nnecessary to interject: \"Here, I say, don't blow!\" Whereas, when she\ncame to write, she sat with her pen poised over the paper for nearly\nhalf an hour, without bringing forth a word. First, there was the\nquestion of form: she considered, then abruptly dismissed, the idea of\nwriting verses: the rhymes with love and dove, and heart and part,\nwhich could have been managed, were, she felt, too silly and\nsentimental to be laid before her quizzical audience. Next, what to\nwrite about--a simple theme, such as a fairy-tale, was not for a moment\nto be contemplated. No, Laura had always flown her hawk high, and she\nwas now bent on making a splutter. It ended by being a toss-up between\na play in the Shakesperian manner and a novel after Scott. She decided\non the novel. It should be a romance of Venice, with abundant murder\nand mystery in it, and a black, black villain, such as her soul\nloved--no macaroon-nibblers or rompers with children for her! And\nhaving thus attuned her mind to scarlet deeds, she set to work. But she\nfound it tremendously difficult to pin her story to paper: she saw\nthings clearly enough, and could have related them by word of mouth;\nbut did she try to write them down they ran to mist; and though she\ntoiled quite literally in the sweat of her brow, yet when the eventful\nday came she had but three niggardly pages to show for her pains.\n\nAbout twenty girls formed the Society, which assembled one Saturday\nevening in an empty music-room. All were not, of course, equally\nproductive: some had brought it no further than a riddle: and it was\njust these drones who, knowing nothing of the pother composition\nimplied, criticised most stringently the efforts of the rest. Several\nmembers had pretty enough talents, Laura's two room-mates among the\nnumber: on the night Laura made her debut, the weightiest achievement\nwas, without doubt, M. P.'s essay on \"Magnanimity\"; and Laura's eyes\ngrew moist as she listened to its stirring phrases. Next best--to her\nthinking, at least--was a humorous episode by Cupid, who had a gift\nthat threw Laura into a fit of amaze; and this was the ability to\nexpand infinitely little into infinitely much; to rig out a trifle in\nmany words, so that in the end it seemed ever so much bigger than it\nreally was--just as a thrifty merchant boils his oranges, to swell them\nto twice their size.\n\nLaura being the youngest member, her affair came last on the programme:\nshe had to sit and listen to the others, her cheeks hot, her hands very\ncold. Presently all were done, and then Cupid, who was chairman, called\non \"a new author, Rambotham, who it is hoped will prove a valuable\nacquisition to the Society, to read us his maiden effort\".\n\nLaura rose to her feet and, trembling with nervousness, stuttered forth\nher prose. The three little pages shot past like a flash; she had\nbarely stood up before she was obliged to sit down again, leaving her\nhearers, who had only just re-adopted their listening attitudes, agape\nwith astonishment. She could have endured, with phlegm, the ridicule\nthis malheur earned her: what was harder to stomach was that her paper\nheroics made utterly no impression. She suffered all the humiliation of\na flabby fiasco, and, till bedtime, shrank out of her friends' way.\n\n\"You were warned not to be too cocky, you know,\" Mary said judicially,\non seeing her downcast air.\n\n\"I didn't mean to be, really.--Then you don't think what I wrote was up\nto much, M. P.?\"\n\n\"Mm,\" said the elder girl, in a non-committal way.\n\nHere Cupid chimed in. \"Look here, Infant, I want to ask you something.\nHave you ever been in Venice?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Ever seen a gondola?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Or the Doge's palace?--or a black-cloaked assassin?--or a masked lady?\"\n\n\"You know I haven't,\" murmured Laura, humbled to the dust.\n\n\"And probably never will. Well then, why on earth try to write wooden,\nsecond-hand rubbish like that?\"\n\n\"Second-hand? ... But Cupid ... think of Scott! He couldn't have seen\nhalf he told about?\"\n\n\"My gracious!\" ejaculated Cupid, and sat down and fanned herself with a\nhairbrush. \"You don't imagine you're a Scott, do you? Here, hold me, M.\nP., I'm going to faint!\"--and at Laura's quick and scarlet denial, she\nadded: \"Well, why the unmentionable not use the eyes the Lord has given\nyou, and write about what's before them every day of your life?\"\n\n\"Do you think that would be better?\"\n\n\"I don't think--I know it would.\"\n\nBut Laura was not so easily convinced as all that.\n\nEver a talented imitator, she next tried her hand at an essay on an\nabstract subject. This was a failure: you could not SEE things, when\nyou wrote about, say, \"Beneficence\"; and Laura's thinking was done\nmainly in pictures. Matters were still worse when she tinkered at\nCupid's especial genre: her worthless little incident stared at her,\nnaked and scraggy, from the sheet; she had no wealth of words at her\ndisposal in which to deck it out. So, with a sigh, she turned back to\nthe advice Cupid had given her, and prepared to make a faithful\ntranscript of actuality. She called what she now wrote: \"A Day at\nSchool\", and conscientiously set down detail on detail; so fearful,\nthis time, of over-brevity, that she spun the account out to twenty\npages; though the writing of it was as distasteful to her as her\nreading of A DOLL'S HOUSE had been.\n\nAt the subsequent meeting of the Society, expression of opinion was not\nlacking.\n\n\"Oh, Jehoshaphat! How much more?\"\n\n\"Here, let me get out. I've had enough.\"\n\n\"I say, you forgot to count how many steps it took you to come\ndownstairs.\"\n\nTill the chairman had pity on the embarrassed author and said: \"Look\nhere, Laura, I think you'd better keep the rest for another time.\"\n\n\"It was just what you told me to do,\" Laura reproached Cupid that\nnight: she was on the brink of tears.\n\nBut Cupid was disinclined to shoulder the responsibility. \"Told you to\nbe as dull and long-winded as that? Infant, it's a whacker!\"\n\n\"But it was TRUE what I wrote--every word of it.\"\n\nNeither of the two elder girls was prepared to discuss this vital\npoint. Cupid shifted ground. \"Good Lord, Laura, but it's hard to drive\na thing into YOUR brain-pan.--You don't need to be ALL true on paper,\nsilly child!\"\n\n\"Last time you said I had to.\"\n\n\"Well, if you want it, my candid opinion is that you haven't any talent\nfor this kind of thing.--Now turn off the gas.\"\n\nAs the light in the room went out, a kind of inner light seemed to go\nup in Laura; and both then and on the following days she thought hard.\nShe was very ambitious, anxious to shine, not ready to accept defeat;\nand to the next literary contest she brought the description of an\nexcursion to the hills and gullies that surrounded Warrenega; into\nwhich she had worked an adventure with some vagrant blacks. She and Pin\nand the boys had often picnicked on these hills, with their lunches\npacked in billies; and she had seen the caves and rocky holes where\nblackfellows were said to have hidden themselves in early times; but\nneither this particular excursion, nor the exciting incident which she\ndescribed with all the aplomb of an eyewitness, had ever taken place.\nThat is to say: not a word of her narration was true, but every word of\nit might have been true.\n\nAnd with this she had an unqualified success.\n\n\"I believe there's something in you after all,\" said Cupid to her that\nnight. \"Anyhow, you know now what it is to be true, yet not dull and\nprosy.\"\n\nAnd Laura manfully choked back her desire to cry out that not a word of\nher story was fact.\n\nShe was long in falling asleep. Naturally, she was elated and excited\nby her success; but also a new and odd piece of knowledge had niched\nitself in her brain. It was this. In your speech, your talk with\nothers, you must be exact to the point of pedantry, and never romance\nor draw the long-bow; or you would be branded as an abominable liar.\nWhereas, as soon as you put pen to paper, provided you kept one foot\nplanted on probability, you might lie as hard as you liked: indeed, the\nmore vigorously you lied, the louder would be your hearers' applause.\n\nAnd Laura fell asleep over a chuckle.\n\n\n\n\nXXII.\n\n\nUND VERGESST MIR AUCH DAS GUTE LACHEN NICHT!\n\nNIETZSCHE\n\n\nAnd then, alas! just as she rode high on this wave of approbation,\nLaura suffered another of those drops in the esteem of her fellows,\nanother of those mental upsets, which from time to time had thrown her\nyoung life out of gear.\n\nTrue, what now came was not exactly her own fault; though it is\ndoubtful whether a single one of her companions would have made her\nfree of an excuse. They looked on, round-eyed, mouths a-stretch. Once\nmore, the lambkin called Laura saw fit to sunder itself from the flock,\nand to cut mad capers in sight of them all. And their delectation was\nas frank as their former wrath had been.--As for Laura, as usual she\ndid not stop to think till it was too late; but danced lightly away to\nher own undoing.\n\nThe affair began pleasantly enough. A member of the Literary Society\nwas the girl with the twinkly brown eyes--she who had gone out of her\nway to give Laura a kindly word after the Shepherd debacle. This girl,\nEvelyn Souttar by name, was also the only one of the audience who had\nnot joined in the laugh provoked by Laura's first appearance as an\nauthor. Laura had never forgotten this; and she would smile shyly at\nEvelyn when their looks met. But a dozen reasons existed why there\nshould have been no further rapport between them. Although now in the\nfifth form, Laura had remained childish for her age: whereas Evelyn was\nover eighteen, and only needed to turn up her hair to be quite\ngrown-up. She had matriculated the previous Christmas, and was at\npresent putting away a rather desultory half-year, before leaving\nschool for good. In addition, she was rich, pampered and very\npretty--the last comrade in the world for drab little Laura.\n\nOne evening, as the latter was passing through the dining-hall, she\nfound Evelyn, who studied where she chose, disconsolately running her\nfingers through her gold-brown hair.\n\n\"I say, Kiddy,\" she called to Laura. \"You know Latin, don't you? Just\ngive us a hand with this.\"--Latin had not been one of Evelyn's\nsubjects, and she was now employing some of her spare time in studying\nthe language with Mr. Strachey, who taught it after a fashion of his\nown. \"How on earth would you say: 'We had not however rid here so long,\nbut should have tided it up the river'? What's the old fool mean by\nthat?\" and she pushed an open volume of ROBINSON CRUSOE towards Laura.\n\nLaura helped to the best of her ability.\n\n\"Thanks awfully,\" said Evelyn. \"You're a clever chickabiddy. But you\nmust let me help you with something in return. What's hardest?\"\n\n\"Filling baths and papering rooms,\" replied Laura candidly.\n\n\"Arithmetic, eh? Well, if ever you want a sum done, come to me.\"\n\nBut Laura was temperamentally unable to accept so vague an invitation;\nand here the matter closed.\n\nWhen, consequently, Miss Chapman summoned her one evening to tell her\nthat she was to change her present bedroom for Evelyn's, the news came\nas a great shock to her.\n\n\"Change my room?\" she echoed, in slow disgust. \"Oh, I can't, Miss\nChapman!\"\n\n\"You've got to, Laura, if Mrs. Gurley says so,\" expostulated the kindly\ngoverness.\n\n\"But I won't! There MUST be some mistake. Just when I'm so comfortably\nsettled, too.--Very well, then, Miss Chapman, I'll speak to Mrs. Gurley\nmyself.\"\n\nShe carried out this threat, and, for daring to question orders,\nreceived the soundest snubbing she had had for many a long day.\n\nThat night she was very bitter about it all, and the more so because\nMary and Cupid did not, to her thinking, show sufficient sympathy.\n\n\"I believe you're both glad I'm going. It's a beastly shame. Why must I\nalways be odd man out?\"\n\n\"Look here, Infant, don't adopt that tone, please,\" said Cupid\nmagisterially. \"Or you'll make us glad in earnest. People who are\nalways up in arms about things are the greatest bores in the world.\"\n\nSo the following afternoon Laura wryly took up armfuls of her\nbelongings, mounted a storey higher, and deposited them on the second\nbed in Evelyn's room.\n\nThe elder girl had had this room to herself for over a year now, and\nLaura felt sure would be chafing inwardly at her intrusion. For days\nshe stole mousily in and out, avoiding the hours when Evelyn was there,\ngetting up earlier in the morning, hurrying into bed at night and\nfeeling very sore indeed at the sufferance on which she supposed\nherself to be.\n\nBut once Evelyn caught her and said: \"Don't, for gracious' sake, knock\neach time you want to come in, child. This is your room now as well as\nmine.\"\n\nLaura reddened, and blurted out something about knowing how she must\nhate to have HER stuck in there.\n\nEvelyn wrinkled up her forehead and laughed. \"What rot! Do you think\nI'd have asked to have you, if I hated it so much?\"\n\n\"You asked to have me?\" gasped Laura.\n\n\"Of course--didn't you know? Old Gurley said I'd need to have some one;\nso I chose you.\"\n\nLaura was too dumbfounded, and too diffident, to ask the grounds of\nsuch a choice. But the knowledge that it was so, worked an instant\nchange in her.\n\nIn all the three years she had been at school, she had not got beyond a\nsurface friendliness with any of her fellows. Even those who had been\nher \"chums\" had wandered like shades through the groves of her\naffection: rough, teasing Bertha; pretty, lazy Inez; perky Tilly,\nslangily frank Maria and Kate, Mary and her moral influence, clever,\ninstructive Cupid: to none of them had she been drawn by any deeper\nsense of affinity. And though she had come to believe, in the course of\nthe last, more peaceful year, that she had grown used to being what you\nwould call an unpopular girl--one, that is, with whom no one ever\nshared a confidence--yet seldom was there a child who longed more\nardently to be liked, or suffered more acutely under dislike. Apart\nhowever from the brusque manner she had contracted, in her search after\ntruth, it must be admitted that Laura had but a small talent for\nfriendship; she did not grasp the constant give-and-take intimacy\nimplies; the liking of others had to be brought to her, unsought, she,\non the other hand, being free to stand back and consider whether or no\nthe feeling was worth returning. And friends are not made in this\nfashion.\n\nBut Evelyn had stoutly, and without waiting for permission, crossed the\nbarrier; and each new incident in her approach was pleasanter than the\nlast. Laura was pleased, and flattered, and round the place where her\nheart was, she felt a warm and comfortable glow.\n\nShe began to return the liking, with interest, after the manner of a\nlonely, bottled-up child. And everything about Evelyn made it easy to\ngrow fond of her. To begin with, Laura loved pretty things and pretty\npeople; and her new friend was out and away the prettiest girl in the\nschool. Then, too, she was clever, and that counted; you did not make a\nfriend of a fool. But her chief characteristics were a certain sound\ncommon sense, and an inexhaustible fund of good-nature--a careless,\nhappy, laughing sunniness, that was as grateful to those who came into\ntouch with it as a rare ointment is grateful to the skin. This\nkindliness arose, it might be, in the first place from indolence: it\nwas less trouble to be merry and amiable than to put oneself out to be\nselfish, which also meant standing a fire of disagreeable words and\nlooks; and then, too, it was really hard for one who had never had a\nwhim crossed to be out of humour. But, whatever its origin, the\ngood-nature was there, everlastingly; and Laura soon learnt that she\ncould cuddle in under it, and be screened by it, as a lamb is screened\nby its mother's woolly coat.\n\nEvelyn was the only person who did not either hector her, or feel it a\nduty to clip and prune at her: she accepted Laura for what she was--for\nherself. Indeed, she even seemed to lay weight on Laura's bits of\nopinions, which the girl had grown so chary of offering; and, under the\nsunshine of this treatment, Laura shot up and flowered like a spring\nbulb. She began to speak out her thoughts again; she unbosomed herself\nof dark little secrets; and finally did what she would never have\nbelieved possible: sitting one night in her nightgown, on the edge of\nEvelyn's bed, she made a full confession of the pickle she had got\nherself into, over her visit to the Shepherds.\n\nTo her astonishment, Evelyn, who was already in bed, laughed till the\ntears ran down her cheeks. At Laura's solemn-faced incredulity she said:\n\n\"I say, Kiddy, but that WAS rich. To think a chicken of your size sold\nthem like that. It's the best joke I've heard for an age. Tell us\nagain--from the beginning.\"\n\nNothing loath Laura started in afresh, and in this, the second telling,\nembroidered the edge of her tale with a few fancy stitches, in a way\nshe had not ventured on for months past; so that Evelyn was more\ntickled than before.\n\n\"No wonder they were mad about being had like that. You little rascal!\"\n\nShe was equally amused by Laura's description of the miserable week she\nhad spent, trying to make up her mind to confess.\n\n\"You ridiculous sprat! Why didn't you come to me? We'd have let them\ndown with a good old bump.\"\n\nBut Laura could not so easily forget the humiliations she had been\nforced to suffer, and delicately hinted to her friend at M. P.'s moral\nstrictures. With her refreshing laugh, Evelyn brushed these aside as\nwell.\n\n\"Tommyrot! Never mind that old jumble-sale of all the virtues. It was\njolly clever of a mite like you to bamboozle them as you did--take my\nword for that.\"\n\nThis jocose way of treating the matter seemed to put it in an entirely\nnew light; Laura could even smile at it herself. In the days that\nfollowed, she learned, indeed, to laugh over it with Evelyn, and to\nshare the latter's view that she had been superior in wit to those she\nhad befooled. This meant a great and healthy gain in self-assurance for\nLaura. It also led to her laying more and more weight on what her\nfriend said. For it was not as if Evelyn had a low moral standard; far\nfrom that: she was honest and straightforward, too proud, or, it might\nbe, too lazy to tell a lie herself--with all the complications lying\ninvolved--and Laura never heard her say a harder thing of anyone than\nwhat she had just said about Mary Pidwall.\n\nThe two talked late into every night after this, Laura perched,\nmonkey-fashion, on the side of her friend's bed. Evelyn had all the\naccumulated wisdom of eighteen, and was able to clear her young\ncompanion up on many points about which Laura had so far been in the\ndark. But when, in time, she came to relate the mortifications she had\nsuffered--and was still called on to suffer--at the hands of the other\nsex, Evelyn pooh-poohed the subject.\n\n\"Time enough in a couple of years for that. Don't bother your head\nabout it in the meantime.\"\n\n\"I don't now--not a bit. I only wanted to know why. Sometimes, Evvy, do\nyou know, they liked to talk to quite little kids of seven and eight\nbetter than me.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you talked too much yourself--and about yourself?\"\n\n\"I don't think I did. And if you don't talk something, they yawn and go\naway.\"\n\n\"You've got to let them do the lion's share, child. Just you sit still,\nand listen, and pretend you like it--even though you're bored to\nextinction.\"\n\n\"And they never need to pretend anything, I suppose? No, I think\nthey're horrid. You don't like them either, Evvy, do you? ... any more\nthan I do?\"\n\nEvelyn laughed.\n\n\"Say what you think they are,\" persisted Laura and waggled the other's\narm, to make her speak.\n\n\"Mostly fools,\" said Evelyn, and laughed again--laughed in all the\nconscious power of lovely eighteen.\n\nOverjoyed at this oneness of mind, Laura threw her arms round her\nfriend's neck and kissed her. \"You dear!\" she said.\n\nAnd yet, a short time afterwards, it was on this very head that she had\nto bear the shock of a rude awakening.\n\nEvelyn's people came to Melbourne that year from the Riverina. Evelyn\nwas allowed considerable freedom, and one night, by special permit,\nLaura also accepted an invitation to dinner and the theatre. The two\ngirls drove to a hotel, where they found Evelyn's mother, elegant but a\nlittle stern, and a young lady-friend. Only the four of them were\npresent at dinner, and the meal passed off smoothly; though the\nstrangeness of dining in a big hotel had the effect of tying Laura's\ntongue. Another thing that abashed her was the dress of the young lady,\nwho sat opposite. This person--she must have been about the ripe age of\ntwenty-five--was nipped into a tight little pink satin bodice, which,\nat the back, exposed the whole of two very bony shoulder-blades. But it\nwas the front of the dress that Laura faced; and, having imbibed strict\nviews of propriety from Mother, she wriggled on her chair whenever she\nraised her eyes.\n\nThey drove to the theatre--though it was only a few doors off. The\nseats were in the dress circle. The ladies sat in the front row, the\ngirls, who were in high frocks, behind.\n\nEvelyn made a face of laughing discontent. \"It's so ridiculous the\nmater won't let me dress.\"\n\nThese words gave Laura a kind of stab. \"Oh Evvy, I think you're EVER so\nmuch nicer as you are,\" she whispered, and squeezed her friend's hand.\n\nEvelyn could not answer, for the lady in pink had leant back and tapped\nher with her fan. \"It doesn't look as if Jim were coming, my dear.\"\n\nEvelyn laughed, in a peculiar way. \"Oh, I guess he'll turn up all\nright.\"\n\nThere had been some question of a person of this name at dinner; but\nLaura had paid no great heed to what was said. Now, she sat up sharply,\nfor Evelyn exclaimed: \"There he is!\"\n\nIt was a man, a real man--not a boy--with a drooping, fair moustache, a\nsingle eyeglass in one eye, and a camellia-bud in his buttonhole. For\nthe space of a breathless second Laura connected him with the pink\nsatin; then he dropped into a vacant seat at Evelyn's side.\n\nFrom this moment on, Laura's pleasure in her expensive seat, in the\npretty blue theatre and its movable roof, in the gay trickeries of the\nMIKADO, slowly fizzled out. Evelyn had no more thought for her. Now and\nthen, it is true, she would turn in her affectionate way and ask Laura\nif she were all right just as one satisfies oneself that a little child\nis happy--but her real attention was for the man at her side. In the\nintervals, the two kept up a perpetual buzz of chat, broken only by\nEvelyn's low laughs. Laura sat neglected, sat stiff and cold with\ndisappointment, a great bitterness welling up within her. Before the\nperformance had dragged to an end, she would have liked to put her head\ndown and cry.\n\n\"Tired?\" queried Evelyn noticing her pinched look, as they drove home\nin the wagonette. But the mother was there, too, so Laura said no.\n\nDirectly, however, the bedroom door shut behind them, she fell into a\ntantrum, a fit of sullen rage, which she accentuated till Evelyn could\nnot but notice it.\n\n\"What's the matter with you? Didn't you enjoy yourself?\"\n\n\"No, I hated it,\" returned Laura passionately.\n\nEvelyn laughed a little at this, but with an air of humorous dismay. \"I\nmust take care, then, not to ask you out again.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't go. Not for anything!\"\n\n\"What on earth's the matter with you?\"\n\n\"Nothing's the matter.\"\n\n\"Well, if that's all, make haste and get into bed. You're overtired.\"\n\n\"Go to bed yourself!\"\n\n\"I am, as fast as I can. I can hardly keep my eyes open;\" and Evelyn\nyawned heartily.\n\nWhen Laura saw that she meant it, she burst out: \"You're nothing but a\nstory-teller--that's what you are! You said you didn't like them ...\nthat they were mostly fools ... and then ... then, to go on as you did\nto-night.\" Her voice was shaky with tears.\n\n\"Oh, that's it, is it? Come now, get to bed. We'll talk about it in the\nmorning.\"\n\n\"I never want to speak to you again.\"\n\n\"You're a silly child. But I'm really too sleepy to quarrel with you\nto-night.\"\n\n\"I hate you--hate you!\"\n\n\"I shall survive it.\"\n\nShe turned out the light as she spoke, settled herself on her pillow,\nand composedly went to sleep.\n\nLaura's rage redoubled. Throwing herself on the floor she burst into\nangry tears, and cried as loudly as she dared, in the hope of keeping\nher companion awake. But Evelyn was a magnificent sleeper; and remained\nundisturbed. So after a time Laura rose, drew up the blind, opened the\nwindow and sat down on the sill.\n\nIt was a bitterly cold night, of milky-white moonlight; each bush and\nshrub carved its jet-black shadow on paths and grass. Across Evelyn's\nbed fell a great patch of light: this, or the chill air would, it was\nto be trusted, wake her. Meanwhile Laura sat in her thin nightgown and\nshivered, feeling the cold intensely after the great heat of the day.\nShe hoped with all her heart that she would be lucky enough to get an\ninflammation of the lungs. Then, Evelyn would be sorry she had been so\ncruel to her.\n\nIt was nearly two o'clock, and she had several times found herself\nnodding, when the sleeper suddenly opened her eyes and sat bolt upright\nin bed.\n\n\"Laura, good heavens, what are you doing at the window? Oh, you wicked\nchild, you'll catch your death of cold! Get into bed at once.\"\n\nAnd, the culprit still maintaining an immovable silence, Evelyn dragged\nher to bed by main force, and tucked her in as tightly as a mummy.\n\n\n\n\nXXIII.\n\n\nGUT UND BOSE UND LUST UND LEID UND ICH UND DU.\n\nNIETZSCHE\n\n\n\"Laura, you're a cipher!\"\n\n\"I'm nothing of the sort!\" threw back Laura indignantly. \"You're one\nyourself.--What does she mean, Evvy?\" she asked getting out of earshot\nof the speaker.\n\n\"Goodness knows. Don't mind her, Poppet.\"\n\nIt was an oppressive evening: all day long a hot north wind had scoured\nthe streets, veiling things and people in clouds of gritty dust; the\nsky was still like the prolonged reflection of a great fire. The\nhoped-for change had not come, and the girls who strolled the paths of\nthe garden were white and listless. They walked in couples, with\ninterlaced arms; and members of the Matriculation Class carried books\nwith them, the present year being one of much struggling and\nheartburning, and few leisured moments. Mary Pidwall and Cupid were\ntogether under an acacia tree at the gate of the tennis-court; and it\nwas M. P. who had cast the above gibe at Laura. At least Laura took it\nas a gibe, and scowled darkly; for she could never grow hardened to\nridicule.\n\nAs she and Evelyn re-passed this spot in their perambulation, a merry\nlittle lump of a girl called Lolo, who darted her head from side to\nside when she spoke, with the movements of a watchful bird--this\n[P.241] Lolo called: \"Evelyn, come here, I want to tell you something.\"\n\n\"Yes, what is it?\" asked Evelyn, but without obeying the summons; for\nshe felt Laura's grip of her arm tighten.\n\n\"It's a secret. You must come over here.\"\n\n\"Hold on a minute, Poppet,\" said Evelyn persuasively, and crossed the\nlawn with her characteristically lazy saunter. Minutes went by; she did\nnot return.\n\n\"Look at her Laura-ship!\" said a saucebox to her partner. The latter\nmade \"Hee-haw, hee-haw!\" and both laughed derisively.\n\nThe object of their scorn stood at the farther end of the wire-net\nfence: all five fingers of her right hand were thrust through the holes\nof the netting, and held oddly and unconsciously outspread; she stood\non one leg, and with her other foot rubbed up and down behind her\nankle; mouth and brow were sullen, her black eyes bent wrathfully on\nher faithless friend.\n\n\"A regular moon-calf!\" said Cupid, looking up from THE TEMPEST, which\nwas balanced breast-high on the narrow wooden top of the fence.\n\n\"Mark my words, that child'll be plucked in her 'tests',\" observed M. P.\n\n\"Serve her right, say I, for playing the billy-ass,\" returned Cupid,\nand killed a giant mosquito with such a whack that her wrist was\nstained with its blood. \"Ugh, you brute! ... gorging yourself on me.\nBut I'm dashed if I know how Evelyn can be bothered to have her always\ndangling round.\"\n\n\"She's a cipher,\" repeated Mary, in so judicial a tone that it closed\nthe conversation.\n\nLaura, not altogether blind to externals, saw that her companions made\nfun of her. But at the present pass, the strength of her feelings quite\nout-ran her capacity for self-control; she was unable to disguise what\nshe felt, and though it made her the laughing-stock of the school. What\nscheme was the birdlike Lolo hatching against her? Why did Evelyn not\ncome back?--these were the thoughts that buzzed round inside her head,\nas the mosquitoes buzzed outside.--And meanwhile the familiar, foolish\nnoises of the garden at evening knocked at her ear. On the other side\nof the hedge a batch of third-form girls were whispering, with choked\nlaughter, a doggerel rhyme which was hard to say, and which meant\nsomething quite different did the tongue trip over a certain letter. Of\ntwo girls who were playing tennis in half-hearted fashion, the one next\nLaura said 'Oh, damn!' every time she missed a ball. And over the\nparched, dusty grass the hot wind blew, carrying with it, from the\nkitchens, a smell of cabbage, of fried onions, of greasy dish-water.\n\nThen Evelyn returned, and a part, a part only of the cloud lifted from\nLaura's brow.\n\n\"What did she want?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing much.\"\n\n\"Then you're not going to tell me?\"\n\nI can't.\n\n\"What business has she to have secrets with you?\" said Laura furiously.\nAnd for a full round of the garden she did not open her lips.\n\nHer companions were not alone in eyeing this lopsided friendship with\nan amused curiosity. The governesses also smiled at it, and were\nsurprised at Evelyn's endurance of the tyranny into which Laura's\nliking had degenerated. On this particular evening, two who were\nsitting on the verandah-bench came back to the subject.\n\n\"Just look at that Laura Rambotham again, will you?\" said Miss\nSnodgrass in her tart way. \"Sulking for all she's worth. What a little\nfool she is!\"\n\n\"I'm sure I wonder Mrs. Gurley hasn't noticed how badly she's working\njust now,\" said Miss Chapman; and her face wore it best-meaning, but\nmost uncertain smile.\n\n\"Oh, you know very well if Mrs. Gurley doesn't want to see a thing she\ndoesn't,\" retorted Miss Snodgrass. \"A regular talent for going blind, I\ncall it--especially where Evelyn Souttar's concerned.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't think you should talk like that,\" urged Miss Chapman\nnervously.\n\n\"I say what I think,\" asserted Miss Snodgrass. \"And if I had my way,\nI'd give Laura Rambotham something she wouldn't forget. That child'll\ncome to a bad end yet.--How do you like that colour, Miss C.?\" She had\na nest of cloth-patterns in her lap, and held one up as she spoke.\n\n\"Oh, you shouldn't say such things,\" remonstrated Miss Chapman.\n\"There's many a true word said in jest.\" She settled her glasses on her\nnose. \"It's very nice, but I think I like a bottle-green better.\"\n\n\"Of course, I don't mean she'll end on the gallows, if that's what\ntroubles you. But she's frightfully unbalanced, and, to my mind, ought\nto have some sense knocked into her before it's too late.--That's a\nbetter shade, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Poor little Laura,\" said Miss Chapman, and drew a sigh. \"Yes, I like\nthat. Where did you say you were going to have the dress made?\"\n\nMiss Snodgrass named, not without pride, one of the first warehouses in\nthe city. \"I've been saving up my screw for it, and I mean to have\nsomething decent this time. Besides, I know one of the men in the shop,\nand I'm going to make them do it cheap.\" And here they fell to\ndiscussing price and cut.\n\nThus the onlookers laughed and quizzed and wondered; no one was bold\nenough to put an open question to Evelyn, and Evelyn did not offer to\ntake anyone into her confidence. She held even hints and allusions at\nbay, with her honeyed laugh; which was HER shield against the world.\nLaura was the only person who ever got behind this laugh, and what she\ndiscovered there, she did not tell. As it was, varying motives were\nsuggested for Evelyn's long-suffering, nobody being ready to believe\nthat it could really be fondness, on her part, for the Byronic atom of\nhumanity she had attracted to her.\n\nHowever that might be, the two girls, the big fair one and the little\ndark one, were, outside class-hours, seldom apart. Evelyn did not\noften, as in the case of the birdlike Lolo, give her young tyrant cause\nfor offence; if she sometimes sought another's company, it was done in\na roguish spirit--from a feminine desire to tease. Perhaps, too, she\nwas at heart not averse to Laura's tantrums, or to testing her own\npower in quelling them. On the whole, though, she was very careful of\nher little friend's sensitive spots. She did not repeat the experiment\nof taking Laura out with her; as her stay at school drew to a close she\nwent out less frequently herself; for the reason that, no matter how\nlate it was on her getting back, she would find Laura obstinately\nsitting up in bed, wide-awake. And it went against the grain in her to\nkeep the pale-faced girl from sleep.\n\nOn such occasions, while she undid her pretty muslin dress, unpinned\nthe flowers she was never without, and loosened her gold-brown hair,\nwhich she had put up for the evening: while she undressed, Evelyn had\nto submit to a rigorous cross-examination. Laura demanded to know where\nshe had been, what she had done, whom she had spoken to; and woe to her\nif she tried to shirk a question. Laura was not only jealous, she was\nextraordinarily suspicious; and the elder girl had need of all her\nlaughing kindness to steer her way through the shallows of distrust.\nFor a great doubt of Evelyn's sincerity had implanted itself in Laura's\nmind: she could not forget the incident of the \"mostly fools\"; and,\nafter an evening of this kind, she never felt quite sure that Evelyn\nwas not deceiving her afresh out of sheer goodness of heart, of\ncourse--by assuring her that she had had a \"horrid time\", been bored to\ndeath, and would have much preferred to stay with her; when the truth\nwas that, in the company of some moustached idiot or other, she had\nenjoyed herself to the top of her bent.\n\nOn the night Laura learned that her friend had again met the loathly\n\"Jim\", there was a great to-do. In vain Evelyn laughed, reasoned,\nexpostulated. Laura was inconsolable.\n\n\"Look here, Poppet,\" said Evelyn at last, and was so much in earnest\nthat she laid her hairbrush down, and took Laura by both her bony\nlittle shoulders. \"Look here, you surely don't expect me to be an old\nmaid, do you?--ME?\" The pronoun signified all she might not say: it\nmeant wealth, youth, beauty, and an unbounded capacity for pleasure.\n\n\"Evvy, you're not going to MARRY that horrid man?\"\n\n\"Of course not, goosey. But that doesn't mean that I'm never going to\nmarry at all, does it?\"\n\nLaura supposed not--with a tremendous sniff.\n\n\"Well, then, what IS all the fuss about?\"\n\nIt was not so easy to say. She was of course reconciled, she sobbed, to\nEvelyn marrying some day: only plain and stupid girls were left to be\nold maids: but it must not happen for years and years and years to\ncome, and when it did, it must be to some one much older than herself,\nsome one she did not greatly care for: in short, Evelyn was to marry\nonly to escape the odium of the single life.\n\nHaving drawn this sketch of her future word by word from the weeping\nLaura, Evelyn fell into a fit of laughter which she could not stifle.\n\"Well, Poppet,\" she said when she could speak, \"if that's your idea of\nhappiness for me, we'll postpone it just as long as ever we can. I'm\nall there. For I mean to have a good time first--a jolly good\ntime--before I tie myself up for ever, world without end, amen.\"\n\n\"That's just what I hate so--your good time, as you call it,\" retorted\nLaura, smarting under the laughter.\n\n\"Everyone does, child. You'll be after it yourself when you're a little\nolder.\"\n\n\"Me?--never!\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, indeed you will.\"\n\n\"I won't. I hate men and I always shall. And oh, I thought\"--with an\nupward, sobbing breath--\"I thought you liked me best.\"\n\n\"Of course I like you, you silly child! But that's altogether\ndifferent. And I don't like you any less because I enjoy having some\nfun with them, too.\"\n\n\"I don't want your old leavings!\" said Laura savagely. It hurt, almost\nas much as having a tooth pulled out, did this knowledge that your\nfriend's affection was wholly yours only as long as no man was in\nquestion. And out of the sting, Laura added: \"Wait till I'm grown up,\nand I'll show them what I think of them--the pigs!\"\n\nThis time Evelyn had to hold her hand in front of her mouth. \"No, no, I\ndon't mean to laugh at you. Come, be good now,\" she petted. \"And you\nreally must go to bed, Laura. It's past twelve o'clock, and that\ninfernal machine'll be going off before you've had any sleep at all.\"\n\nThe \"machine\" was Laura's alarum, which ran down every night just now\nat two o'clock. For, if one thing was sure, it was that affairs with\nLaura were in a sorry muddle. In this, the last and most momentous year\nof her school life, at the close of which, like a steep wall to be\nscaled, rose the university examination, she was behindhand with her\nwork, and occupied a mediocre place in her class. So steadfastly was\nher attention pitched on Evelyn that she could link it to nothing else:\nin the middle of an important task, her thoughts would stray to\ncontemplate her friend or wonder what she was doing; while, if Evelyn\nwere out for the evening, Laura gave up her meagre pretence of study\naltogether, and moodily propped her head in her hand. This was why she\nhad hit on the small hours for the necessary cramming; then, there were\nno distractions: the great house was as still as an empty church; and\nEvelyn lay safe and sound before her. So, punctually at two o'clock\nLaura was startled, with a pounding heart, out of her first sleep; and\nlighting the gas she sat up in bed and pored over her books. Evelyn was\nnot disturbed by the light, or at least she did not complain; and it\nwas certainly a famous time for committing things to memory: the\nsubsequent hours of sleep seemed rather to etch the facts into your\nbrain than to blur them.\n\nYou cannot however rob Peter to pay Paul, with impunity, and in the\nweeks that followed, despite her nightly industry, Laura made no\nheadway.\n\nAs the term tapered to an end, things went from bad to worse with her;\nand since, besides, the parting with Evelyn was at the door, she was\noften to be seen with red-rimmed eyelids, which she did not even try to\nconceal.\n\n\"As if she'd lost her nearest relation!\" laughed her school-fellows.\nAnd did they meet her privately, on the stairs or in a house-corridor,\nthey crossed their hands on their breasts and turned up their eyes, in\ntragedy-fashion.\n\nLaura hardly saw them; for once in her life ridicule could not have\nher. The nearer the time drew, the more completely did the coming loss\nof Evelyn push other considerations into the background. It was bitter\nto reflect that her present dear friendship had no more strength to\nendure than the thin pretences of friendship she had hitherto played\nat. Evelyn and she would, no doubt, from time to time meet and take\npleasure in each other again; but their homes lay hundreds of miles\napart; and the intimacy of the schooldays was passing away, never to\nreturn. And no one could be held to blame for this. Evelyn's mother and\nfather thought, rightly enough, that it was time for their daughter to\nleave school--but that was all. They did not really miss her, or need\nher. No, it was just a stupid, crushing piece of ill-luck, which\nhappened one did not know why. The ready rebel in Laura sprang into\nbeing again; and she fought hard against the lesson that there are\nevents in life--bitter, grim, and grotesque events--beneath which one\ncan only bow one's head.--A further effect of the approaching\nseparation was to bring home to her a sense of the fleetingness of\nthings; she began to grasp that, everywhere and always, even while you\nrevelled in them, things were perpetually rushing to a close; and the\nfact of them being things you loved, or enjoyed, was powerless to\ndiminish the speed at which they escaped you.\n\nOf course, though, these were sensations rather than thoughts; and they\ndid not hinder Laura from going on her knees to Evelyn, to implore her\nto remain. Day after day Evelyn kindly and patiently explained why this\ncould not be; and if she sometimes drew a sigh at the child's\npersistence, it was too faint to be audible. Now Laura knew that it was\npossible to kill animal-pets by surfeiting them; and, towards the end,\na suspicion dawned on her that you might perhaps damage feelings in the\nsame way. It stood to reason: no matter how fond two people were of\neach other, the one who was about to emerge, like a butterfly from its\nsheath, could not be asked to regret her release; and, at moments--when\nLaura lay sobbing face downwards on her bed, or otherwise vented her\npertinacious and disruly grief--at these moments she thought she\nscented a dash of relief in Evelyn, at the prospect of deliverance.\n\nBut such delicate hints on the part of the hidden self are rarely able\nto gain a hearing; and, as the days dropped off one by one, like\nover-ripe fruit, Laura surrendered herself more and more blindly to her\nemotions. The consequence was, M. P.'s prediction came true: in the\ntest-examinations which took place at midwinter, Laura, together with\nthe few dunces of her class, was ignominiously plucked. And still\nstaggering under this blow, she had to kiss Evelyn good-bye, and to set\nher face for home.\n\n\n\n\nXXIV.\n\n\nWAS MICH NICHT UMBRINGT, MACHT MICH STARKER.\n\nNIETZSCHE\n\n\nMother did not know or understand anything about \"tests\"; and Laura had\nno idea of enlightening her. She held her peace, and throughout the\nholidays hugged her disgraceful secret to her, untold. She had never\nbefore failed to pass an examination, having always lightly skimmed the\nsurface of them on the wings of her parrot-like memory; hence, at home\nno one suspected that anything was amiss with her. The knowledge\nweighed the more heavily on her own mind. And, as if her other troubles\nwere not enough, she was now beset by nervous fears about the future.\nShe saw chiefly rocks ahead. If she did not succeed in getting through\nthe final examination in summer, she would not be allowed to present\nherself for matriculation, and, did this happen, there would be the\nvery devil to pay. All her schooling would, in Mother's eyes, have been\nfor naught. For Mother was one of those people who laid tremendous\nweight on prizes and examinations, as offering a tangible proof that\nyour time had not been wasted or misspent. Besides this, she could not\nafford in the event of a failure, to pay the school-fees for another\nyear. The money which, by hook and by crook, had been scraped together\nand hoarded up for Laura's education was now coming to an end; as it\nwas, the next six months would mean a terrible pinching and screwing.\nThe other children, too, were growing day by day more costly; their\nlittle minds and bodies clamoured for a larger share of attention. And\nLaura's eyes were rudely opened to the struggle Mother had had to make\nboth ends meet, while her first-born was acquiring wisdom; for Mother\nspoke of it herself, spoke openly of her means and resources, perhaps\nwith some idea of rousing in Laura a gratitude that had so far been\ndormant.\n\nIf this was her intention she failed. Laura was much too fast entangled\nin her own troubles, to have leisure for such a costly feeling as\ngratitude; and Mother's outspokenness only added a fresh weight to her\npack. It seemed as if everybody and everything were ranged against her;\nand guilty, careworn, lonely, she shrank into her shell. About school\naffairs she again kept her lips shut, enduring, like a stubborn martyr,\nthe epithets \"close\" and \"deceitful\" this reticence earned her. Her\ntime was spent in writing endless, scrawly letters to Evelyn, which\ncovered days; in sitting moodily at the top of the fir tree which she\nclimbed in defiance of her length of petticoat glaring at sunsets, and\nbrooding on dead delights; in taking long, solitary, evening walks, by\nchoice on the heel of a thunderstorm, when the red earth was riddled by\ncreeklets of running water; till Mother, haunted by a lively fear of\nencounters with \"swags\" or Chinamen, put her foot down and forbade them.\n\nSufferers are seldom sweet-tempered; and Laura formed no exception.\nPin, her most frequent companion, had to bear the brunt of her\nacrimony: hence the two were soon at war again. For Pin was tactless,\nand took small heed of her sister's grumpy moods, save to cavil at\nthem. Laura's buttoned-upness, for instance, and her love of solitude,\nwere perverse leanings to Pin's mind; and she spoke out against them\nwith the assurance of one who has public opinion at his back. Laura\nretaliated by falling foul of little personal traits in Pin: a nervous\nhabit she had of clearing her throat--her very walk. They quarrelled\npassionately, having branched as far apart as the end-points of what is\nultimately to be a triangle, between which the connecting lines have\nnot yet been drawn.\n\nSometimes they even came to blows.\n\n\"I'll fetch your ma to you--that I will!\" threatened Sarah, called by\nthe noise of the scuffle. \"Great girls like you--fightin' like\nbandicoots! You ought to be downright ashamed o' yourselves.\"\n\n\"I don't know what's come over you two, I'm sure,\" scolded Mother, when\nthe combatants had been parted and brought before her in the kitchen,\nwhere she was rolling pastry. \"You never used to go on like this.--Pin,\nstop that noise. Do you want to deafen me?\"\n\n\"She hit me first,\" sobbed Pin. \"It's always Laura who begins.\"\n\n\"I'll teach her to cheek me like that!\"\n\n\"Well, all I can say is,\" said Mother exasperated, and pushed a lock of\nhair off her perspiring forehead with the back of her hand. \"All I say\nis, big girls as you are, you deserve to have the nonsense whipped out\nof you.--As for you, Laura, if this is your only return for all the\nmoney I've spent on you, then I wish from my heart you'd never seen the\ninside of that Melbourne school.\"\n\n\"How pretty your eyes look, mother, when your eyelashes get floury!\"\nsaid Laura, struck by the vivid contrast of black and white. She merely\nstated the fact, without intent to flatter, her anger being given to\npuffing out as suddenly as it kindled.\n\n\"Oh, get along with you!\" said Mother, at the same time skilfully\nlifting and turning a large, thin sheet of paste. \"You can't get round\nME like that.\"\n\n\"You used to have nice, ladylike manners,\" she said on another\noccasion, when Laura, summoned to the drawingroom to see a visitor, had\nin Mother's eyes disgraced them both. \"Now, you've no more idea how to\nbehave than a country bumpkin. You sit there, like a stock or a stone,\nas if you didn't know how to open your mouth.\"--Mother was very cross.\n\n\"I didn't want to see that old frump anyhow,\" retorted Laura, who\ninclined to charge the inhabitants of the township with an extreme\nprovinciality. \"And what else was there to say, but yes or no? She\nasked me all things I didn't know anything about. You don't want me to\ntell stories, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Well, if a child of mine doesn't know the difference between being\npolite and telling stories,\" said Mother, completely outraged, \"then,\nall I can say is, it's a ... a great shame!\" she wound up lamely, after\nthe fashion of hot-tempered people who begin a sentence without being\nclear how they are going to end it.--\"You were a nice enough child\nonce. If only I'd never let you leave home.\"\n\nThis jeremiad was repeated by Mother and chorused by the rest till\nLaura grew incensed. She was roused to defend her present self, at the\ncost of her past perfections; and this gave rise to new dissensions.\n\nSo that in spite of what she had to face at school, she was not\naltogether sorry, when the time came, to turn her back on her unknowing\nand hence unsympathetic relations. She journeyed to Melbourne on one of\nthose pleasant winter days when the sun shines from morning till night\nin a cloudless sky, and the chief mark of the season is the\nextraordinary greenness of the grass; returned a pale, determined,\nlanky girl, full of the grimmest resolutions.\n\nThe first few days were like a bad dream. The absence of Evelyn came\nhome to her in all its crushing force. A gap yawned drearily where\nEvelyn had been--but then, she had been everywhere. There was now a\nkind of emptiness about the great school--except for memories, which\ncropped up at each turn. Laura was in a strange room, with strange,\nindifferent girls; and for a time she felt as lonely as she had done in\nthose unthinkable days when she was still the poor little green \"new\nchum\".\n\nHer companions were not wilfully unkind to her--her last extravagance\nhad been foolish, not criminal--and two or three were even sorry for\nthe woebegone figure she cut. But her idolatrous attachment to Evelyn\nhad been the means of again drawing round her one of those magic\ncircles, which held her schoolfellows at a distance. And the aroma of\nher eccentricity still clung to her. The members of her class were deep\nin study, too; little was now thought or spoken of but the approaching\nexaminations. And her first grief over, Laura set her teeth and flung\nherself on her lessons like a dog on a bone, endeavouring to pack the\nconscientious work of twelve months into less than six.\n\nThe days were feverish with energy. But at night the loneliness\nreturned, and was only the more intense because, for some hours on end,\nshe had been able to forget it.\n\nOn one such night when she lay wakeful, haunted by the prospect of\nfailure, she turned over the leaves of her Bible--she had been\nmemorising her weekly portion--and read, not as a school-task, but for\nherself. By chance she lighted on the Fourteenth Chapter of St John,\nand the familiar, honey-sweet words fell on her heart like caresses.\nHer tears flowed; both at the beauty of the language and out of pity\nfor herself; and before she closed the Book, she knew that she had\nfound a well of comfort that would never run dry.\n\nIn spite of a certain flabbiness in its outward expression, deep down\nin Laura the supreme faith of childhood still dwelt intact: she\nbelieved, with her whole heart, in the existence of an all-knowing God,\nand just as implicitly in His perfect power to succour His human\nchildren at will. But thus far on her way she had not greatly needed\nHim: at the most, she had had recourse to Him for forgiveness of sin.\nNow, however, the sudden withdrawal of a warm, human sympathy seemed to\nopen up a new use for Him. An aching void was in her and about her; it\nwas for Him to fill this void with the riches of His love.--And she\ncomforted herself for her previous lack of warmth, by the reminder that\nHis need also was chiefly of the heavy-laden and oppressed.\n\nIn the spurt of intense religious fervour that now set in for her, it\nwas to Christ she turned by preference, rather than to the remoter God\nthe Father. For of the latter she carried a kind of Michelangelesque\npicture in her brain: that of an old, old man with a flowing grey\nbeard, who sat, Turk-fashion, one hand plucking at this beard, the\nother lying negligently across His knees. Christ, on the contrary, was\na young man, kindly of face, and full of tender invitation.\n\nTo this younger, tenderer God, she proffered long and glowing prayers,\nwhich vied with one another in devoutness. Soon she felt herself led by\nHim, felt herself a favourite lying on His breast; and, as the days\nwent by, her ardour so increased that she could not longer consume the\nsmoke of her own fire: it overspread her daily life--to the renewed\nembarrassment of her schoolfellows. Was it then impossible, they asked\nthemselves, for Laura Rambotham to do anything in a decorous and\nladylike way. Must she at every step put them out of countenance? It\nwas not respectable to be so fervent. Religion, felt they, should be\npractised with modesty; be worn like an indispensable but private\ngarment. Whereas she committed the gross error in taste of, as it were,\nparading it outside her other clothes.\n\nLaura, her thoughts turned heavenwards, did not look low enough to\ndetect the distaste in her comrades' eyes. The farther she spun herself\ninto her intimacy with the Deity, the more indifferent did she grow to\nthe people and things of this world.\n\nWeeks passed. Her feelings, in the beginning a mere blissful certainty\nthat God was Love and she was God's, ceased to be wholly passive. Thus,\nher first satisfaction at her supposed election was soon ousted by\nself-righteousness, did she contemplate her unremitting devotion. And\none night, when her own eloquence at prayer had brought the moisture to\nher eyes--one night the inspiration fell. Throughout these weeks, she\nhad faithfully worshipped God without asking so much as a pin's head\nfrom Him in return; she had given freely; all she had, had been His.\nNow the time had surely come when she might claim to be rewarded. Now\nit was for Him to show that He had appreciated her homage.--Oh, it was\nso easy a thing for Him to help her, if He would ... if He only would!\n\nPressing her fingers to her eyeballs till the starry blindness was\neffected that induces ecstasy, she prostrated herself before the\nmercy-seat, not omitting, at this crisis, to conciliate the Almighty by\nlaying stress on her own exceeding unworthiness.\n\n\"Oh, dear Lord Jesus, have mercy upon me, miserable sinner! Oh, Christ,\nI ask Thy humble pardon! For I have been weak, Lord, and have forgotten\nto serve Thy Holy Name. My thoughts have erred and strayed like ...\nlike lost sheep. But loved Thee, Jesus, all the time, my heart seemed\nfull as it would hold ... no, I didn't mean to say that. But I was not\never thus, nor prayed that Thou shouldst lead me on. But now, dear\nJesus, if Thou wilt only grant me my desire, I will never forget Thee\nor be false to Thee again. I will love Thee and serve Thee, all the\ndays of my life, till death us do ... I mean, only let me pass my\nexaminations, Lord, and there is nothing I will not do for Thee in\nreturn. Oh, dear Lord Jesus, Son of Mary, hear my prayer, and I will\nworship Thee and adore Thee, and never forget Thee, and that Thou hast\ndied to save me! Grant me this my prayer, Lord, for Christ's sake,\nAmen.\"\n\nIt came to this: Laura made a kind of pact with God, in which His aid\nat the present juncture guaranteed her continued, unswerving allegiance.\n\nThe idea once lodged in her mind, she wrestled with Him night after\nnight, filling His ears with her petitions, and remaining on her knees\nfor such an immoderate length of time that her room-mates, who were\nsleepy, openly expressed their impatience.\n\n\"Oh, draw it mild, Laura!\" said the girl in the neighbouring bed, when\nit began to seem as if the supplicant would never rise to her feet\nagain. \"Leave something to ask Him to-morrow.\"\n\nBut Laura, knowing very well that the Lord our God is a jealous God,\nwas mindful not to scrimp in lip-service, or to shirk the minutest\nceremony by means of which He might be propitiated and won over. Her\nprayers of greeting and farewell, on entering and leaving church, were\ndrawn out beyond anyone else's; she did not doze or dream over a single\nclause of the Litany, with its hypnotising refrain; and she not only\nmade the sign of the Cross at the appropriate place in the Creed, but\nalso privately at every mention of Christ's name.\n\nMeanwhile, of course, she worked at her lessons with unflagging zeal,\nfor it was by no means her intention to throw the whole onus of her\nsuccess on the Divine shoulders. She overworked; and on one occasion\nhad a distressing lapse of memory.\n\nAnd at length spring was gone and summer come, and the momentous week\narrived on which her future depended. Now, though, she was not alone in\nher trepidation. The eyes of even the surest members of the form had a\nsteely glint in them, and mouths were hard. Dr. Pughson's papers were\nsaid to be far more formidable than the public examination: if you got\nhappily through these, you were safe.\n\nSix subjects were compulsory; high-steppers took nine. Laura was one of\nthose with eight, and since her two obligatory mathematics were not to\nbe relied on, she could not afford to fail in a single subject.\n\nIn the beginning, things, with the exception of numbers, went pretty\nwell with her. Then came the final day, and with it the examination in\nhistory. Up to the present year Laura had cut a dash in history; now\nher brain was muddled, her memory overtaxed, by her having had to cram\nthe whole of Green's HISTORY OF THE ENGLISH PEOPLE in a few months,\nbesides a large dose of GREECE and ROME. Reports ran of the\nexceptionally \"catchy\" nature of Dr Pughson's questions; and Laura's\nprayer, the night before, was more like a threat than a supplication.\nThe class had only just entered the Headmaster's room on the eventful\nmorning, and begun to choose desks, when there came a summons to Laura\nto take a music-lesson. This was outside consideration, and Dr Pughson\nmade short work of the intruder--a red-haired little girl, who blushed\nmeekly and unbecomingly, and withdrew. Here, however, Laura rose and\ndeclared that, under these circumstances, some explanation was due to\nMonsieur Boehmer, the music-master, to-day's lesson being in fact a\nrehearsal for the annual concert.\n\nDr Pughson raised his red-rimmed eyes from his desk and looked very\nfierce.\n\n\"Tch, tch, tch!\" he snapped, in the genial Irish fashion that made him\ndreaded and adored. \"How like a woman that is! Playing at concerts when\nshe can't add two and two together!--Your arithmetic paper's fit for\nPUNCH, Miss Rambotham.\"\n\nThe smile he looked for went round.\n\n\"Have you seen the questions?--no? Well, give them here then. You've\ngot to go, I suppose, or we might deprive the concert of your shining\nlight.--Hurry back, now. Stir your stumps!\"\n\nBut this Laura had no intention of doing. In handling the printed slip,\nher lagging eye had caught the last and most vital question: \"Give a\nfull account of Oliver Cromwell's Foreign Policy.\"--And she did not\nknow it! She dragged out her interview with the music-master, put\nquestions wide of the point, insisted on lingering till he had arranged\nanother hour for the postponed rehearsal; and, as she walked, as she\ntalked, as she listened to Monsieur Boehmer's ridiculous English, she\nstrove in vain to recall jot or tittle of Oliver's relations to foreign\npowers.--Oh, for just a peep at the particular page of Green! For, if\nonce she got her cue, she believed she could go on.\n\nThe dining-hall was empty when she went through it on her way back to\nthe classroom: her history looked lovingly at her from its place on the\nshelf. But she did not dare to go over to it, take it out, and turn up\nthe passage: that was too risky. What she did do, however, when she had\nalmost reached the door, was to dash back, pull out a synopsis--[P.262]\na slender, medium-sized volume--and hastily and clumsily button this\ninside the bodice of her dress. The square, board-like appearance it\ngave her figure, where it projected beyond the sides of her apron, she\nconcealed by hunching her shoulders.\n\nHer lightning plan was, to enter a cloakroom, snatch a hurried peep at\nOliver's confounded policy, then hide the book somewhere till the\nexamination was over. But on emerging from the dining-hall she all but\ncollided with the secretary, who had come noiselessly across the\nverandah; and she was so overcome by the thought of the danger she had\nrun, and by Miss Blount's extreme surprise at Dr Pughson's leniency,\nthat she allowed herself to be driven back to the examination-room\nwithout a word.\n\nThe girls were hard at it; they scarcely glanced up when she opened the\ndoor. From her friends' looks, she could judge of the success they were\nhaving. Cupid, for instance, was smirking to herself in the peculiar\nfashion that meant satisfaction; M. P.'s cheeks were the colour of\nmonthly roses. And soon Laura, crouching low to cover her deformity,\nwas at work like the rest.\n\nHad only Oliver Cromwell never been born!--thus she reflected, when she\nhad got the easier part of the paper behind her. Why could it not have\nbeen a question about Bourke and Wills, or the Eureka Stockade, or the\nvoyages of Captain Cook? ... something about one's own country, that\none had heard hundreds of times and was really interested in. Or a big,\narresting thing like the Retreat of the Ten Thousand, or Hannibal's\nMarch over the Alps? Who cared for old Oliver, and his shorn head, and\nhis contempt for baubles! What did it matter now to anyone what his\nattitude had been, more than two hundred years ago, to all those\nfar-away, dream-like countries? ... Desperately she pressed her hand to\nher eyes. She knew the very page of Green on which Cromwell's foreign\nrelations were set forth; knew where the paragraph began, near the foot\nof the page: what she could not get hold of was the opening sentence\nthat would have set her mechanical memory a-rolling.\n\nThe two hours drew steadily to a close. About half an hour beforehand\nthe weakest candidates began to rise, to hand in their papers and leave\nthe room; but it was not till ten minutes to twelve that the \"crack\"\ngirls stopped writing. Laura was to be allowed an extra twenty minutes,\nand it was on this she relied. At last, she was alone with the master.\nBut though he was already dipping into the examination-papers, he was\nnot safe. She had unbuttoned two buttons and was at a third, when he\nlooked up so unexpectedly that she was scared out of her senses, and\nfastened her dress again with all the haste she could. Three or four of\nthe precious minutes were lost.\n\nAt this point, the door opened and Mr. Strachey strode into the room.\nDr Pughson blinked up from the stacks of papers, rose, and the two\nspoke in low tones. Then, with a glance at Laura, they went together to\nthe door, which Dr Pughson held to behind him, and stood just over the\nthreshold. As they warmed to their talk, the master let the door slip\ninto the latch.\n\nLaura could see them from where she sat, without being seen. A moment\nlater they moved stealthily away, going down the verandah in the\ndirection of the office.\n\nNow for it! With palsied hands she undid her bodice, clutched at the\nbook, forced her blurred eyes to find the page, and ran them over it. A\nbrief survey: five or six heads to remember: a few dates. Flapped to\nagain; tucked under her apron; shoved into her bosom.\n\nAnd not a second too soon. There he came, hurrying back. And three\nbuttons were still undone. But Laura's head was bent over her desk:\nthough her heart was pummelling her ribs, her pen now ran like\nlightning; and by the time the order to stop was given, she had covered\nthe requisite number of sheets. Afterwards she had adroitly to rid\nherself of the book, then to take part--a rather pale-eyed, distracted\npart--in the lively technical discussions that ensued; when each\ncandidate was as long-winded on the theme of her success, or\nnon-success, as a card-player on his hand at the end of a round.\nDirectly she could make good her escape, she pleaded a headache,\nclimbed to her bedroom and stretched herself flat on her bed. She was\nthrough--but at what a cost! She felt quite sore. Her very bones seemed\nto hurt her.\n\nNot till she was thoroughly rested, and till she had assured herself\nthat all risk attaching to the incident was over, did she come to\nreflect on the part God had played in the business. And then, it must\nbe admitted, she found it a sorry one. Just at first, indeed, her\nlimpid faith was shocked into a reluctance to believe that He had\nhelped her at all: His manner of doing it would have been so\ninexpressibly mean. But, little by little, she dug deeper, and\neventually she reached the [P.265] conclusion that He had given her the\noption of this way, throwing it open to her and then standing back and\nwatching to see what she would do, without so much as raising an eyelid\nto influence her decision. In fact, the more she pondered over it, the\nmore inclined she grew to think that it had been a kind of snare on the\npart of God, to trap her afresh into sin, and thus to prolong her\ndependence on Him after her crying need was past. But, if this were\ntrue, if He had done this, then He must LIKE people to remain miserable\nsinners, so that He might have them always crawling to His feet. And\nfrom this view of the case her ingenuous young mind shrank appalled.\nShe could not go on loving and worshipping a God who was capable of\ndouble dealing; who could behave in such a \"mean, Jewy fashion\". Nor\nwould she ever forget His having forced her to endure the moments of\ntorture she had come through that day.\n\nLying on her bed, she grappled with these thoughts. A feeling of deep\nresentment was their abiding result. Whatever His aim, it had been past\nexpression pitiless of Him, Him who had at His command thousands of\npleasanter ways in which to help her, thus to drive a poor unhappy girl\nto extremities: one, too, whose petition had not been prompted by\nselfish ends alone. What she had implored of Him touched Mother even\nmore nearly than herself: her part prayer to Him had been to save\nMother--whose happiness depended on things like examinations--from a\nbitter disappointment. That much at least He had done--she would give\nHim His due--but at the expense of her entire self-respect. Oh, He must\nhave a cold, calculating heart ... could one only see right down into\nit. The tale of His clemency and compassion, which the Bible told, was\nnot to be interpreted literally: when one came to think of it, had He\never--outside the Bible--been known to stoop from His judgment-seat,\nand lovingly and kindly intervene? It was her own absurd mistake: she\nhad taken the promises made through His Son, for gospel truth; had\nthought He really meant what He said, about rewarding those who were\nfaithful to Him. Her companions--the companions on whom, from the\nheights of her piety, she had looked pityingly down--were wiser than\nshe. They did not abase themselves before Him, and vow a lifelong\ndevotion; but neither did they make any but the most approved demands\non Him. They satisfied their consciences by paying Him lip-homage, by\nconfessing their sins, and by asking for a vague, far-distant mercy, to\nwhich they attached no great importance. Hence, they never came into\nfierce personal conflict with Him. Nor would she, ever again; from this\ntime forward, she would rival the rest in lukewarmness.--But, before\nshe could put this resolve into force, she had to let her first\nindignation subside: only then was it possible for her to recover the\nshattering of her faith, and settle down to practise religion after the\nglib and shallow mode of her friends. She did not, however, say her\nprayers that night, or for many a right to come; and when, at church,\nChrist's name occurred in the Service, she held her head erect, and\nshut the ears and eyes of her soul.\n\n\n\n\nXXV.\n\n\nIHR LERNTET ALLE NICHT TANZEN, WIE MAN TANZEN MUSS--UBER EUCH HINWEG\nTANZEN!\n\nNIETZSCHE\n\n\nThe school year had ebbed; the ceremonies that attended its conclusion\nwere over. A few days beforehand, the fifth-form boarders, under the\ntutelage of a couple of governesses, drove off early in the morning to\nthe distant university. On the outward journey the candidates were\nthoughtful and subdued; but as they returned home, in the late\nafternoon, their spirits were not to be kept within seemly bounds. They\nlaughed, sang, and rollicked about inside the wagonette, Miss Zielinski\nweakly protesting unheard--were so rowdy that the driver pushed his\ncigar-stump to the corner of his mouth, to be able to smile at ease,\nand flicked his old horse into a canter. For the public examination had\nproved as anticipated, child's play, compared with what the class had\nbeen through at Dr Pughson's hands; and its accompanying details were\nof an agreeable nature: the weather was not too hot; the\nexamination-hall was light and airy; through the flung-back windows\ntrees and flowering shrubs looked in; the students were watched over by\na handsome Trinity man, who laid his straw hat on the desk before him.\n\nThen came the annual concert, at which none of the performers broke\ndown; Speech Day, when the body of a big hall was crowded with\nrelatives and friends, and when so many white, blue-beribboned frocks\nwere massed together on the platform, that this looked like a great bed\nof blue and white flowers; and, finally, trunks were brought out from\nboxrooms and strewn through the floors, and upper-form girls emptied\ncupboards and drawers into them for the last time.\n\nOn the evening before the general dispersion, Laura, Cupid, and M. P.\nwalked the well-known paths of the garden once again. While the two\nelder girls were more loquacious than their wont, Laura was quieter.\nShe had never wholly recovered her humour since the day of the\nhistory-examination; and she still could not look back, with composure,\non the jeopardy in which she had placed herself one little turn of the\nwheel in the wrong direction, and the end of her schooldays would have\nbeen shame and disgrace.--And just as her discovery of God's stratagem\nhad damped her religious ardour, so her antipathy to the means she had\nbeen obliged to employ had left a feeling of enmity in her, towards the\nschool and everything connected with it: she had counted the hours till\nshe could turn her back on it altogether. None the less, now that the\ntime had come there was a kind of ache in her at having to say\ngood-bye; for it was in her nature to let go unwillingly of things,\nplaces and people once known. Besides, glad as she felt to have done\nwith learning, she was unclear what was to come next. The idea of life\nat home attracted her as little as ever--Mother had even begun to hint\nas well that she would now be expected to instruct her young brothers.\nHence, her parting was effected with very mixed feelings; she did not\nknow in the least where she really belonged, or under what conditions\nshe would be happy; she was conscious only of a mild sorrow at having\nto take leave of the shelter of years.\n\nHer two companions had no such doubts and regrets; for them the past\nwas already dead and gone; their talk was all of the future, so soon to\nbecome the present. They forecast this, mapping it out for themselves\nwith the iron belief in their power to do so, which is the hall-mark of\nyouth.\n\nLaura, walking at their side, listened to their words with the deepest\ninterest, and with the reverence she had learned to extend to all\nopinions save her own.\n\nM. P. proposed to return to Melbourne at the end of the vacation; for\nshe was going on to Trinity, where she intended to take one degree\nafter another. She hesitated only whether it was to be in medicine or\narts.\n\n\"Oogh! ... to cut off people's legs!\" ejaculated Laura. \"M. P., how\nawful.\"\n\n\"Oh, one soon gets used to that, child.--But I think, on the whole, I\nshould prefer to take up teaching. Then I shall probably be able to\nhave a school of my own some day.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't wonder if you got Sandy's place here,\" said Laura, who was\nassured that M. P.'s massy intellect would open all doors.\n\n\"Who knows?\" answered Mary, and set her lips in a determined fashion of\nher own. \"Stranger things have happened.\"\n\nCupid, less enamoured of continual discipline, intended to be a writer.\n\"My cousin says I've got the stuff in me. And he's a journalist and\nought to know.\"\n\n\"I should rather think he ought.\"\n\n\"Well, I mean to have a shot at it.\"\n\n\"And you, Laura?\" M. P. asked suavely.\n\n\"Me?--Oh, goodness knows!\"\n\n\"Close as usual, Infant.\"\n\n\"No, really not, Cupid.\"\n\n\"Well, you'll soon have to make up your mind to something now. You're\nnearly sixteen.--Why not go on working for your B.A.?\"\n\n\"No thanks! I've had enough of that here.\" And Laura's thoughts waved\ntheir hands, as it were, to the receding figure of Oliver Cromwell.\n\n\"Be a teacher, then.\"\n\n\"M.P.! I never want to hear a date or add up a column of figures again.\"\n\n\"Laura!\"\n\n\"It's the solemn truth. I'm fed up with all those blessed things.\"\n\n\"Fancy not having a single wish!\"\n\n\"Wish? ... oh, I've tons of wishes. First I want to be with Evvy again.\nAnd then, I want to see things--yes, that most of all. Hundreds and\nthousands of things. People, and places, and what they eat, and how\nthey dress, and China, and Japan ... just tons.\"\n\n\"You'll have to hook a millionaire for that, my dear.\"\n\n\"And perhaps you'll write a book about your travels for us\nstay-at-homes.\"\n\n\"Gracious! I shouldn't know how to begin. But you'll send me all you\nwrite--all YOUR books--won't you, Cupid? And, M. P., you'll let me come\nand see you get your degrees--every single one.\"\n\nWith these and similar promises the three girls parted. They never met\nagain. For a time they exchanged letters regularly, many-sheeted\nletters, full of familiar, personal detail. Then the detail ceased, the\npages grew fewer in number, the time-gap longer. Letters in turn gave\nplace to mere notes and postcards, scribbled in violent haste, at wide\nintervals. And ultimately even these ceased; and the great silence of\nseparation was unbroken. Nor were the promises redeemed: there came to\nLaura neither gifts of books nor calls to be present at academic\nrobings. Within six months of leaving school, M. P. married and settled\ndown in her native township; and thereafter she was forced to adjust\nthe rate of her progress to the steps of halting little feet. Cupid\nwent a-governessing, and spent the best years of her life in the\nobscurity of the bush.\n\nAnd Laura? ... In Laura's case, no kindly Atropos snipped the thread of\nher aspirations: these, large, vague, extemporary, one and all achieved\nfulfilment; then withered off to make room for more. But this, the\nfuture still securely hid from her. She went out from school with the\nuncomfortable sense of being a square peg, which fitted into none of\nthe round holes of her world; the wisdom she had got, the experience\nshe was richer by, had, in the process of equipping her for life,\nmerely seemed to disclose her unfitness. She could not then know that,\neven for the squarest peg, the right hole may ultimately be found;\nseeming unfitness prove to be only another aspect of a peculiar and\nspecial fitness. But, of the after years, and what they brought her, it\nis not the purport of this little book to tell. It is enough to say:\nmany a day came and went before she grasped that, oftentimes, just\nthose mortals who feel cramped and unsure in the conduct of everyday\nlife, will find themselves to rights, with astounding ease, in that\nfreer, more spacious world where no practical considerations hamper,\nand where the creatures that inhabit dance to their tune: the world\nwhere are stored up men's best thoughts, the hopes, and fancies; where\nthe shadow is the substance, and the multitude of business pales before\nthe dream.\n\nIn the meantime, however, the exodus of the fifty-five turned the\nCollege upside-down.\n\nEarly the following morning Laura made her final preparations for\ndeparture. This, alas! was not to be on so imposing a scale as the\ndepartures of her schoolfellows. They, under special escort, would have\na cab apiece, and would drive off with flying handkerchiefs and all\ntheir luggage piled high in front. Whereas Laura's box had gone by van:\nfor she and Pin, who was in Melbourne on a visit, were to spend a\ncouple of days at Godmother's before starting up-country. Even her\nfarewells, which she had often rehearsed to herself with dramatic\nemphasis, went off without eclat. Except for Miss Chapman, the\ngovernesses were absent when the moment came, and Miss Chapman's mind\nwas so full of other things that she went on giving orders while she\nwas shaking hands.\n\nBut Laura was not destined to leave the walls, within the shadow of\nwhich she had learned so much, as tamely as all this. There was still a\nsurprise in waiting for her. As she whisked about the corridors in\nsearch of Mrs. Gurley, she met two girls, one of whom said: \"I say,\nLaura Rambotham, you're fetched. Your pretty sister's come for you.\"\n\n\"My ... who?\" gaped Laura.\n\n\"Your sister. By gum, there's a nose for you--and those whopping eyes!\nYou'll have to play second fiddle to THAT, all your days, my dear.\"\n\nOn entering the reception-room Laura tried hard to see Pin with the\neyes of a stranger. Pin rose from her chair--awkwardly, of course, for\nthere were other people present, and Laura's violent stare was\ndisconcerting in the extreme: it made Pin believe her hat was crooked,\nor that she had a black speck on her nose. As for Laura, she could see\nno great change in her sister; the freckles were certainly paler, and\nthe features were perhaps beginning to emerge a little, from the\ncushiony fat in which they were bedded; but that was all. Still, if\noutsiders, girls in particular, were struck by it ...\n\nA keener stab than this--really, she did not grudge Pin being pretty:\nit was only the newness of the thing that hurt--a keener stab was it\nthat, though she had ordered Pin repeatedly, and with all the stress\nshe was master of, to come in a wagonette to fetch her, so that she\nmight at least drive away like the other girls; in spite of this, the\nlittle nincompoop had after all arrived on foot. Godmother had said the\nidea of driving was stuff and nonsense--a quite unnecessary expense.\nPin, of course, had meekly given in; and thus Laura's last brave\nattempt to be comfortably like her companions came to naught. She went\nout of the school in the same odd and undignified fashion in which she\nhad lived there.\n\nThe wrangle caused by Pin's chicken-heartedness lasted the sisters down\nthe garden-path, across the road, and over into the precincts of a\nlarge, public park. Only when they were some distance through this, did\nLaura wake to what was happening to her. Then, it came over her with a\nrush: she was free, absolutely free; she might do any mortal thing she\nchose.\n\nAs a beginning she stopped short.\n\n\"Hold on, Pin ... take this,\" she said, giving her sister the heavy\nleather bag they were carrying in turns to the tramway. Pin obediently\nheld out her hand, in its little white cotton glove.\n\n\"And my hat.\"\n\n\"What are you going to do, Laura?\"\n\n\"You'll see.\"\n\n\"You'll get sunstroke!\"\n\n\"Fiddles!--it's quite shady. Here're my gloves.--Now, Pin, you follow\nyour nose and you'll find me--WHERE you find me!\"\n\n\"Oh, what ARE you going to do, Laura?\" cried Pin, in anxiety.\n\n\"I'm going to have a good run,\" said Laura; and tightened her\nhair-ribbon.\n\n\"Oh, but you can't run in the street! You're too big. People'll see\nyou.\"\n\n\"Think I care?--If you'd been years only doing what you were allowed\nto, I guess you'd want to do something you weren't allowed to, too.--\nGood-bye!\"\n\nShe was off, had darted away into the leaden heat of the December\nmorning, like an arrow from its bow, her head bent, her arms close to\nher sides, fleet-footed as a spaniel: Pin was faced by the swift and\nrhythmic upturning of her heels. There were not many people abroad at\nthis early hour, but the few there were, stood still and looked in\namazement after the half-grown girl in white, whose thick black plait\nof hair sawed up and down as she ran; and a man with mop and bucket,\nwho was washing statues, stopped his work and whistled, and winked at\nPin as she passed.\n\nCross and confused Pin trudged after her sister, Laura's hat and gloves\nin one hand, the leather bag in the other.\n\nRight down the central avenue ran Laura, growing smaller and smaller in\nthe distance, the area of her movements decreasing as she ran, till she\nappeared to be almost motionless, and not much larger than a figure in\nthe background of a picture. Then came a sudden bend in the long,\nstraight path. She shot round it, and was lost to sight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Getting of Wisdom, by Henry Handel Richardson\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE GETTING OF WISDOM ***\n\n***** This file should be named 3728.txt or 3728.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/3\/7\/2\/3728\/\n\nProduced by Col Choat.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":371,"split":"train"}
