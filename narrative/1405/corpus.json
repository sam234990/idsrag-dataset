{"ori_id":"e292eae2486862f6df6ff388cb2dd6777bc73f27","title":"The Sessions (film)","context":"The Sessions (film)\n In Berkeley, California in 1988, Mark O'Brien is a poet who is forced to live in an iron lung due to complications from polio. Due to his condition, he has never had sex. After unsuccessfully proposing to his caretaker Amanda, and sensing he may be near death, he decides he wants to lose his virginity. After consulting his priest, Father Brendan, he gets in touch with Cheryl Cohen-Greene, a professional sex surrogate. She tells him they will have no more than six sessions together. They begin their sessions, but soon it is clear that they are developing romantic feelings for each other. Cheryl's husband, who loves her deeply, fights to suppress his jealousy, at first withholding a love poem that Mark has sent by mail to Cheryl, which she eventually finds. After several attempts, Mark and Cheryl are able to have mutually satisfying sex, but decide to cut the sessions short on account of their burgeoning feelings.\nOne day sometime later, the power goes out in the building in which Mark lives, causing the iron lung to stop functioning and making it necessary for Mark to be rushed to the hospital. However, he survives and meets Susan Fernbach, a young woman with whom the audience senses he will finally find happiness. The film then cuts to Mark's funeral, held sometime later, and attended by four of the women he came to know and care for, including Cheryl. Father Brendan gives the homily and Susan reads the poem he had previously sent Cheryl.\n<html>\n<head><title>Sessions, The Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Sessions, The script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Sessions, The script, Sessions, The movie script, Sessions, The film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

The passenger, MARK\n    O'BRIEN, in his early 30s, is visible only from the neck up.\n    The rest of him is covered by a blanket.

As it settles down to its meal, we\n     become aware of a heavy and regular sound, like a ship's\n     pump, coming from somewhere close-by.\n\n     In the center of the room is an object that looks like a prop\n     from a `50s sci-fi movie. A human head protrudes from one\n     end. The object is an iron lung, and its purpose is to keep\n     its occupant, Mark O'Brien, breathing. Every 4.5 seconds, the\n     pump mechanism creates a vacuum inside, forcing Mark's chest\n     to expand and suck in air. He is fast asleep.\n<b>                                   2A.\n<\/b>\n\n<b>                     MARK (V.O.)\n<\/b>          Breathing\n          Look you\n          This most excellent canopy, the\n          air,\n          Presses down upon me\n          At 15 pounds per square inch\n          A dense, heavy, blue-glowing ocean.\n          Teasing me with its nearness and\n          immensity.\n          And all I get is a thin stream of\n          it.\n          A finger's width of the rope that\n          ties me to life.\n\nHaving now eaten its fill, the cat has a good scratch, then\nwanders over to the iron lung.\n<b>                                        3.\n<\/b>\n\n    It hops up onto the small platform that supports Mark's head\n    and slides itself along his face, once this way, once the\n    other way, then jumps on top of the iron lung and walks its\n    length. Through the portholes, we just make out the shape of\n    Mark's bent, undersize body.  Suddenly, Mark's nose twitches.\n    He opens his eyes and grimaces.\n\n<b>                           MARK\n<\/b>              Shit!\n\n    His face continues to contort as he tries to cope with the\n    terrible itching.  He shakes his head violently, then stops\n    suddenly and closes his eyes. We hear his thoughts.\n\n<b>                        MARK (V.O.) (CONT'D)\n<\/b>              Okay, just focus.

In his peripheral vision, Mark can see the\n    cat making itself comfortable in a corner chair, one of the\n    only other pieces of furniture in the room. The first hints\n    of dawn start to appear through the curtains. They\n    illuminate a large framed portrait of the Virgin Mary hanging\n    on the wall.   Mark acknowledges it.\n\n<b>                        MARK (CONT'D)\n<\/b>              Good morning.\n\n    Sunlight streams in, making the picture look truly sacred.\n\n<b>    EXT.   MARK'S PLACE.
