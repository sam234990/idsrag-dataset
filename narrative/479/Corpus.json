{"ori_id":"6fe349aaec027415d3cf64f2e667ea425908f004","title":"Jude the Obscure","context":"Jude the Obscure\n The novel tells the story of Jude Fawley, who lives in a village in southern England (part of Hardy's fictional county of Wessex), who yearns to be a scholar at \"Christminster\", a city modelled on Oxford. As a youth, Jude teaches himself Classical Greek and Latin in his spare time, while working first in his great-aunt's bakery, with the hope of entering university. But before he can try to do this the na\u8ab0ve Jude is seduced by Arabella Donn, a rather coarse and superficial local girl who traps him into marriage by pretending to be pregnant. The marriage is a failure, and they separate by mutual agreement, and Arabella later emigrates to Australia, where she enters into a bigamous marriage. By this time, Jude has abandoned his classical studies.\nAfter Arabella leaves him, Jude moves to Christminster and supports himself as a mason while studying alone, hoping to be able to enter the university later. There, he meets and falls in love with his free-spirited cousin, Sue Bridehead. But, shortly after this, Jude introduces Sue to his former schoolteacher, Mr. Phillotson, whom she eventually marries. However, she soon regrets this, because in addition to being in love with Jude, she is physically disgusted by her husband, and, apparently, by sex in general. Sue soon leaves Phillotson for Jude. Because of the scandal Phillotson has to give up his career as a schoolmaster.\nSue and Jude spend some time living together without any sexual relationship, because of Sue's dislike both of sex and the institution of marriage. Soon after, Arabella reappears and this complicates matters. But Arabella and Jude divorce and she legally marries her bigamous husband, and Sue also is divorced. However, following this, Arabella reveals that she had a child of Jude's, eight months after they separated, and subsequently sends this child to his father. He is named Jude and nicknamed \"Little Father Time\" because of his intense seriousness and moroseness.\nJude eventually convinces Sue to sleep with him and, over the years, they have two children together and expect the third. But Jude and Sue are socially ostracised for living together unmarried, especially after the children are born. Jude's employers dismiss him because of the illicit relationship, and the family is forced into a nomadic lifestyle, moving from town to town across Wessex seeking employment and housing before eventually returning to Christminster. Their socially troubled boy, \"Little Father Time\", comes to believe that he and his half-siblings are the source of the family's woes. The morning after their arrival in Christminster, he murders Sue's two children and commits suicide by hanging. He leaves behind a note that simply reads, \"Done because we are too menny.\" Shortly thereafter, Sue has a miscarriage.\nBeside herself with grief and blaming herself for \"Little Father Time\"'s actions, Sue turns to the church that she has rebelled against and comes to believe that the children's deaths were divine retribution for her relationship with Jude. Although horrified at the thought of resuming her marriage with Phillotson, she becomes convinced that, for religious reasons, she should never have left him. Arabella discovers Sue's feelings and informs Phillotson, who soon proposes they remarry. This results in Sue leaving Jude once again for Phillotson. Jude is devastated and remarries Arabella after she plies him with alcohol to once again trick him into marriage.\nAfter one final, desperate visit to Sue in freezing weather, Jude becomes seriously ill and dies within the year. It is revealed that Sue has grown \"staid and worn\" with Phillotson. Arabella fails to mourn Jude's passing, instead setting the stage to ensnare her next suitor.\nThe events of Jude the Obscure occur over a 19-year period, but no dates are specifically given in the novel. Aged 11 at the beginning of the novel, by the time of his death, Jude seems much older than his thirty years, for he has experienced so much disappointment and grief in his total life experience. It would seem that his burdens exceeded his sheer ability to survive, much less to triumph.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Jude the Obscure, by Thomas Hardy\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

O\n    ye men, how can it be but women should be strong, seeing\n    they do thus?\"--ESDRAS.\n\n\nI\n\n\nThe schoolmaster was leaving the village, and everybody seemed sorry.\nThe miller at Cresscombe lent him the small white tilted cart and\nhorse to carry his goods to the city of his destination, about twenty\nmiles off, such a vehicle proving of quite sufficient size for the\ndeparting teacher's effects.  For the schoolhouse had been partly\nfurnished by the managers, and the only cumbersome article possessed\nby the master, in addition to the packing-case of books, was a\ncottage piano that he had bought at an auction during the year in\nwhich he thought of learning instrumental music.  But the enthusiasm\nhaving waned he had never acquired any skill in playing, and the\npurchased article had been a perpetual trouble to him ever since in\nmoving house.\n\nThe rector had gone away for the day, being a man who disliked the\nsight of changes.  He did not mean to return till the evening, when\nthe new school-teacher would have arrived and settled in, and\neverything would be smooth again.\n\nThe blacksmith, the farm bailiff, and the schoolmaster himself were\nstanding in perplexed attitudes in the parlour before the instrument.\nThe master had remarked that even if he got it into the cart he\nshould not know what to do with it on his arrival at Christminster,\nthe city he was bound for, since he was only going into temporary\nlodgings just at first.\n\nA little boy of eleven, who had been thoughtfully assisting in the\npacking, joined the group of men, and as they rubbed their chins he\nspoke up, blushing at the sound of his own voice: \"Aunt have got a\ngreat fuel-house, and it could be put there, perhaps, till you've\nfound a place to settle in, sir.\"\n\n\"A proper good notion,\" said the blacksmith.\n\nIt was decided that a deputation should wait on the boy's aunt--an\nold maiden resident--and ask her if she would house the piano till\nMr. Phillotson should send for it.  The smith and the bailiff started\nto see about the practicability of the suggested shelter, and the boy\nand the schoolmaster were left standing alone.\n\n\"Sorry I am going, Jude?\" asked the latter kindly.\n\nTears rose into the boy's eyes, for he was not among the regular day\nscholars, who came unromantically close to the schoolmaster's life,\nbut one who had attended the night school only during the present\nteacher's term of office.  The regular scholars, if the truth must\nbe told, stood at the present moment afar off, like certain historic\ndisciples, indisposed to any enthusiastic volunteering of aid.\n\nThe boy awkwardly opened the book he held in his hand, which Mr.\nPhillotson had bestowed on him as a parting gift, and admitted that\nhe was sorry.\n\n\"So am I,\" said Mr. Phillotson.\n\n\"Why do you go, sir?\" asked the boy.\n\n\"Ah--that would be a long story.  You wouldn't understand my reasons,\nJude.  You will, perhaps, when you are older.\"\n\n\"I think I should now, sir.\"\n\n\"Well--don't speak of this everywhere.  You know what a university\nis, and a university degree?  It is the necessary hallmark of a man\nwho wants to do anything in teaching.  My scheme, or dream, is to be\na university graduate, and then to be ordained.  By going to live at\nChristminster, or near it, I shall be at headquarters, so to speak,\nand if my scheme is practicable at all, I consider that being on the\nspot will afford me a better chance of carrying it out than I should\nhave elsewhere.\"\n\nThe smith and his companion returned.  Old Miss Fawley's fuel-house\nwas dry, and eminently practicable; and she seemed willing to give\nthe instrument standing-room there.  It was accordingly left in\nthe school till the evening, when more hands would be available for\nremoving it; and the schoolmaster gave a final glance round.\n\nThe boy Jude assisted in loading some small articles, and at nine\no'clock Mr. Phillotson mounted beside his box of books and other\n_impedimenta_, and bade his friends good-bye.\n\n\"I shan't forget you, Jude,\" he said, smiling, as the cart moved off.\n\"Be a good boy, remember; and be kind to animals and birds, and read\nall you can.  And if ever you come to Christminster remember you hunt\nme out for old acquaintance' sake.\"\n\nThe cart creaked across the green, and disappeared round the corner\nby the rectory-house. The boy returned to the draw-well at the edge\nof the greensward, where he had left his buckets when he went to help\nhis patron and teacher in the loading.  There was a quiver in his lip\nnow and after opening the well-cover to begin lowering the bucket he\npaused and leant with his forehead and arms against the framework,\nhis face wearing the fixity of a thoughtful child's who has felt the\npricks of life somewhat before his time.  The well into which he was\nlooking was as ancient as the village itself, and from his present\nposition appeared as a long circular perspective ending in a shining\ndisk of quivering water at a distance of a hundred feet down.\nThere was a lining of green moss near the top, and nearer still the\nhart's-tongue fern.\n\nHe said to himself, in the melodramatic tones of a whimsical boy,\nthat the schoolmaster had drawn at that well scores of times on a\nmorning like this, and would never draw there any more.  \"I've seen\nhim look down into it, when he was tired with his drawing, just as I\ndo now, and when he rested a bit before carrying the buckets home!\nBut he was too clever to bide here any longer--a small sleepy place\nlike this!\"\n\nA tear rolled from his eye into the depths of the well.  The morning\nwas a little foggy, and the boy's breathing unfurled itself as\na thicker fog upon the still and heavy air.  His thoughts were\ninterrupted by a sudden outcry:\n\n\"Bring on that water, will ye, you idle young harlican!\"\n\nIt came from an old woman who had emerged from her door towards the\ngarden gate of a green-thatched cottage not far off.  The boy quickly\nwaved a signal of assent, drew the water with what was a great effort\nfor one of his stature, landed and emptied the big bucket into his\nown pair of smaller ones, and pausing a moment for breath, started\nwith them across the patch of clammy greensward whereon the well\nstood--nearly in the centre of the little village, or rather hamlet\nof Marygreen.\n\nIt was as old-fashioned as it was small, and it rested in the lap of\nan undulating upland adjoining the North Wessex downs.  Old as it\nwas, however, the well-shaft was probably the only relic of the local\nhistory that remained absolutely unchanged.  Many of the thatched\nand dormered dwelling-houses had been pulled down of late years, and\nmany trees felled on the green.  Above all, the original church,\nhump-backed, wood-turreted, and quaintly hipped, had been taken\ndown, and either cracked up into heaps of road-metal in the lane, or\nutilized as pig-sty walls, garden seats, guard-stones to fences, and\nrockeries in the flower-beds of the neighbourhood.  In place of it\na tall new building of modern Gothic design, unfamiliar to English\neyes, had been erected on a new piece of ground by a certain\nobliterator of historic records who had run down from London and back\nin a day.  The site whereon so long had stood the ancient temple to\nthe Christian divinities was not even recorded on the green and level\ngrass-plot that had immemorially been the churchyard, the obliterated\ngraves being commemorated by eighteen-penny cast-iron crosses\nwarranted to last five years.\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nSlender as was Jude Fawley's frame he bore the two brimming\nhouse-buckets of water to the cottage without resting.  Over the door\nwas a little rectangular piece of blue board, on which was painted\nin yellow letters, \"Drusilla Fawley, Baker.\"  Within the little lead\npanes of the window--this being one of the few old houses left--were\nfive bottles of sweets, and three buns on a plate of the willow\npattern.\n\nWhile emptying the buckets at the back of the house he could hear an\nanimated conversation in progress within-doors between his great-aunt,\nthe Drusilla of the sign-board, and some other villagers.  Having\nseen the school-master depart, they were summing up particulars of\nthe event, and indulging in predictions of his future.\n\n\"And who's he?\" asked one, comparatively a stranger, when the boy\nentered.\n\n\"Well ye med ask it, Mrs. Williams.  He's my great-nephew--come since\nyou was last this way.\"  The old inhabitant who answered was a tall,\ngaunt woman, who spoke tragically on the most trivial subject, and\ngave a phrase of her conversation to each auditor in turn.  \"He come\nfrom Mellstock, down in South Wessex, about a year ago--worse luck\nfor 'n, Belinda\" (turning to the right) \"where his father was living,\nand was took wi' the shakings for death, and died in two days, as you\nknow, Caroline\" (turning to the left). \"It would ha' been a blessing\nif Goddy-mighty had took thee too, wi' thy mother and father, poor\nuseless boy!  But I've got him here to stay with me till I can see\nwhat's to be done with un, though I am obliged to let him earn any\npenny he can.  Just now he's a-scaring of birds for Farmer Troutham.\nIt keeps him out of mischty.  Why do ye turn away, Jude?\" she\ncontinued, as the boy, feeling the impact of their glances like slaps\nupon his face, moved aside.\n\nThe local washerwoman replied that it was perhaps a very good plan of\nMiss or Mrs. Fawley's (as they called her indifferently) to have him\nwith her--\"to kip 'ee company in your loneliness, fetch water, shet\nthe winder-shetters o' nights, and help in the bit o' baking.\"\n\nMiss Fawley doubted it....  \"Why didn't ye get the schoolmaster to\ntake 'ee to Christminster wi' un, and make a scholar of 'ee,\" she\ncontinued, in frowning pleasantry.  \"I'm sure he couldn't ha' took a\nbetter one.  The boy is crazy for books, that he is.  It runs in our\nfamily rather.  His cousin Sue is just the same--so I've heard; but\nI have not seen the child for years, though she was born in this\nplace, within these four walls, as it happened.  My niece and her\nhusband, after they were married, didn' get a house of their own for\nsome year or more; and then they only had one till--Well, I won't go\ninto that.  Jude, my child, don't you ever marry.  'Tisn't for the\nFawleys to take that step any more.  She, their only one, was like\na child o' my own, Belinda, till the split come!  Ah, that a little\nmaid should know such changes!\"\n\nJude, finding the general attention again centering on himself, went\nout to the bakehouse, where he ate the cake provided for his\nbreakfast.  The end of his spare time had now arrived, and emerging\nfrom the garden by getting over the hedge at the back he pursued a\npath northward, till he came to a wide and lonely depression in the\ngeneral level of the upland, which was sown as a corn-field.  This\nvast concave was the scene of his labours for Mr Troutham the farmer,\nand he descended into the midst of it.\n\nThe brown surface of the field went right up towards the sky all\nround, where it was lost by degrees in the mist that shut out the\nactual verge and accentuated the solitude.  The only marks on the\nuniformity of the scene were a rick of last year's produce standing\nin the midst of the arable, the rooks that rose at his approach, and\nthe path athwart the fallow by which he had come, trodden now by he\nhardly knew whom, though once by many of his own dead family.\n\n\"How ugly it is here!\" he murmured.\n\nThe fresh harrow-lines seemed to stretch like the channellings in\na piece of new corduroy, lending a meanly utilitarian air to the\nexpanse, taking away its gradations, and depriving it of all history\nbeyond that of the few recent months, though to every clod and stone\nthere really attached associations enough and to spare--echoes of\nsongs from ancient harvest-days, of spoken words, and of sturdy\ndeeds.  Every inch of ground had been the site, first or last,\nof energy, gaiety, horse-play, bickerings, weariness.  Groups of\ngleaners had squatted in the sun on every square yard. Love-matches\nthat had populated the adjoining hamlet had been made up there\nbetween reaping and carrying.  Under the hedge which divided the\nfield from a distant plantation girls had given themselves to lovers\nwho would not turn their heads to look at them by the next harvest;\nand in that ancient cornfield many a man had made love-promises to\na woman at whose voice he had trembled by the next seed-time after\nfulfilling them in the church adjoining.  But this neither Jude nor\nthe rooks around him considered. For them it was a lonely place,\npossessing, in the one view, only the quality of a work-ground, and\nin the other that of a granary good to feed in.\n\nThe boy stood under the rick before mentioned, and every few seconds\nused his clacker or rattle briskly.  At each clack the rooks left off\npecking, and rose and went away on their leisurely wings, burnished\nlike tassets of mail, afterwards wheeling back and regarding him\nwarily, and descending to feed at a more respectful distance.\n\nHe sounded the clacker till his arm ached, and at length his heart\ngrew sympathetic with the birds' thwarted desires.  They seemed, like\nhimself, to be living in a world which did not want them.  Why should\nhe frighten them away?  They took upon more and more the aspect of\ngentle friends and pensioners--the only friends he could claim as\nbeing in the least degree interested in him, for his aunt had often\ntold him that she was not.  He ceased his rattling, and they alighted\nanew.\n\n\"Poor little dears!\" said Jude, aloud.  \"You SHALL have some dinner--\nyou shall.  There is enough for us all.  Farmer Troutham can afford\nto let you have some.  Eat, then my dear little birdies, and make a\ngood meal!\"\n\nThey stayed and ate, inky spots on the nut-brown soil, and Jude\nenjoyed their appetite.  A magic thread of fellow-feeling united his\nown life with theirs.  Puny and sorry as those lives were, they much\nresembled his own.\n\nHis clacker he had by this time thrown away from him, as being a mean\nand sordid instrument, offensive both to the birds and to himself\nas their friend.  All at once he became conscious of a smart blow\nupon his buttocks, followed by a loud clack, which announced to his\nsurprised senses that the clacker had been the instrument of offence\nused.  The birds and Jude started up simultaneously, and the dazed\neyes of the latter beheld the farmer in person, the great Troutham\nhimself, his red face glaring down upon Jude's cowering frame, the\nclacker swinging in his hand.\n\n\"So it's 'Eat my dear birdies,' is it, young man?  'Eat, dear\nbirdies,' indeed!  I'll tickle your breeches, and see if you say,\n'Eat, dear birdies,' again in a hurry!  And you've been idling at the\nschoolmaster's too, instead of coming here, ha'n't ye, hey?  That's\nhow you earn your sixpence a day for keeping the rooks off my corn!\"\n\nWhilst saluting Jude's ears with this impassioned rhetoric, Troutham\nhad seized his left hand with his own left, and swinging his slim\nframe round him at arm's-length, again struck Jude on the hind parts\nwith the flat side of Jude's own rattle, till the field echoed with\nthe blows, which were delivered once or twice at each revolution.\n\n\"Don't 'ee, sir--please don't 'ee!\" cried the whirling child, as\nhelpless under the centrifugal tendency of his person as a hooked\nfish swinging to land, and beholding the hill, the rick, the\nplantation, the path, and the rooks going round and round him in an\namazing circular race.  \"I--I sir--only meant that--there was a good\ncrop in the ground--I saw 'em sow it--and the rooks could have a\nlittle bit for dinner--and you wouldn't miss it, sir--and Mr.\nPhillotson said I was to be kind to 'em--oh, oh, oh!\"\n\nThis truthful explanation seemed to exasperate the farmer even more\nthan if Jude had stoutly denied saying anything at all, and he still\nsmacked the whirling urchin, the clacks of the instrument continuing\nto resound all across the field and as far as the ears of distant\nworkers--who gathered thereupon that Jude was pursuing his business\nof clacking with great assiduity--and echoing from the brand-new\nchurch tower just behind the mist, towards the building of which\nstructure the farmer had largely subscribed, to testify his love for\nGod and man.\n\nPresently Troutham grew tired of his punitive task, and depositing\nthe quivering boy on his legs, took a sixpence from his pocket and\ngave it him in payment for his day's work, telling him to go home and\nnever let him see him in one of those fields again.\n\nJude leaped out of arm's reach, and walked along the trackway\nweeping--not from the pain, though that was keen enough; not from the\nperception of the flaw in the terrestrial scheme, by which what was\ngood for God's birds was bad for God's gardener; but with the awful\nsense that he had wholly disgraced himself before he had been a year\nin the parish, and hence might be a burden to his great-aunt for\nlife.\n\nWith this shadow on his mind he did not care to show himself in the\nvillage, and went homeward by a roundabout track behind a high hedge\nand across a pasture.  Here he beheld scores of coupled earthworms\nlying half their length on the surface of the damp ground, as\nthey always did in such weather at that time of the year.  It was\nimpossible to advance in regular steps without crushing some of them\nat each tread.\n\nThough Farmer Troutham had just hurt him, he was a boy who could not\nhimself bear to hurt anything.  He had never brought home a nest of\nyoung birds without lying awake in misery half the night after, and\noften reinstating them and the nest in their original place the next\nmorning.  He could scarcely bear to see trees cut down or lopped,\nfrom a fancy that it hurt them; and late pruning, when the sap was up\nand the tree bled profusely, had been a positive grief to him in his\ninfancy.  This weakness of character, as it may be called, suggested\nthat he was the sort of man who was born to ache a good deal before\nthe fall of the curtain upon his unnecessary life should signify that\nall was well with him again.  He carefully picked his way on tiptoe\namong the earthworms, without killing a single one.\n\nOn entering the cottage he found his aunt selling a penny loaf to a\nlittle girl, and when the customer was gone she said, \"Well, how do\nyou come to be back here in the middle of the morning like this?\"\n\n\"I'm turned away.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Mr. Troutham have turned me away because I let the rooks have a few\npeckings of corn.  And there's my wages--the last I shall ever hae!\"\n\nHe threw the sixpence tragically on the table.\n\n\"Ah!\" said his aunt, suspending her breath.  And she opened upon him\na lecture on how she would now have him all the spring upon her hands\ndoing nothing.  \"If you can't skeer birds, what can ye do?  There!\ndon't ye look so deedy!  Farmer Troutham is not so much better than\nmyself, come to that.  But 'tis as Job said, 'Now they that are\nyounger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have\ndisdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.'  His father was my\nfather's journeyman, anyhow, and I must have been a fool to let 'ee\ngo to work for 'n, which I shouldn't ha' done but to keep 'ee out of\nmischty.\"\n\nMore angry with Jude for demeaning her by coming there than for\ndereliction of duty, she rated him primarily from that point of view,\nand only secondarily from a moral one.\n\n\"Not that you should have let the birds eat what Farmer Troutham\nplanted.  Of course you was wrong in that.  Jude, Jude, why didstn't\ngo off with that schoolmaster of thine to Christminster or somewhere?\nBut, oh no--poor or'nary child--there never was any sprawl on thy\nside of the family, and never will be!\"\n\n\"Where is this beautiful city, Aunt--this place where Mr. Phillotson\nis gone to?\" asked the boy, after meditating in silence.\n\n\"Lord! you ought to know where the city of Christminster is.  Near a\nscore of miles from here.  It is a place much too good for you ever\nto have much to do with, poor boy, I'm a-thinking.\"\n\n\"And will Mr. Phillotson always be there?\"\n\n\"How can I tell?\"\n\n\"Could I go to see him?\"\n\n\"Lord, no!  You didn't grow up hereabout, or you wouldn't ask such as\nthat.  We've never had anything to do with folk in Christminster, nor\nfolk in Christminster with we.\"\n\nJude went out, and, feeling more than ever his existence to be an\nundemanded one, he lay down upon his back on a heap of litter near\nthe pig-sty.  The fog had by this time become more translucent, and\nthe position of the sun could be seen through it.  He pulled his\nstraw hat over his face, and peered through the interstices of the\nplaiting at the white brightness, vaguely reflecting.  Growing up\nbrought responsibilities, he found.  Events did not rhyme quite as\nhe had thought.  Nature's logic was too horrid for him to care for.\nThat mercy towards one set of creatures was cruelty towards another\nsickened his sense of harmony.  As you got older, and felt yourself\nto be at the centre of your time, and not at a point in its\ncircumference, as you had felt when you were little, you were seized\nwith a sort of shuddering, he perceived.  All around you there seemed\nto be something glaring, garish, rattling, and the noises and glares\nhit upon the little cell called your life, and shook it, and warped\nit.\n\nIf he could only prevent himself growing up!  He did not want to be a\nman.\n\nThen, like the natural boy, he forgot his despondency, and sprang up.\nDuring the remainder of the morning he helped his aunt, and in the\nafternoon, when there was nothing more to be done, he went into the\nvillage.  Here he asked a man whereabouts Christminster lay.\n\n\"Christminster?  Oh, well, out by there yonder; though I've never bin\nthere--not I.  I've never had any business at such a place.\"\n\nThe man pointed north-eastward, in the very direction where lay that\nfield in which Jude had so disgraced himself.  There was something\nunpleasant about the coincidence for the moment, but the fearsomeness\nof this fact rather increased his curiosity about the city.  The\nfarmer had said he was never to be seen in that field again; yet\nChristminster lay across it, and the path was a public one.  So,\nstealing out of the hamlet, he descended into the same hollow which\nhad witnessed his punishment in the morning, never swerving an inch\nfrom the path, and climbing up the long and tedious ascent on the\nother side till the track joined the highway by a little clump of\ntrees.  Here the ploughed land ended, and all before him was bleak\nopen down.\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nNot a soul was visible on the hedgeless highway, or on either side of\nit, and the white road seemed to ascend and diminish till it joined\nthe sky.  At the very top it was crossed at right angles by a green\n\"ridgeway\"--the Ickneild Street and original Roman road through the\ndistrict.  This ancient track ran east and west for many miles, and\ndown almost to within living memory had been used for driving flocks\nand herds to fairs and markets.  But it was now neglected and\novergrown.\n\nThe boy had never before strayed so far north as this from the\nnestling hamlet in which he had been deposited by the carrier from a\nrailway station southward, one dark evening some few months earlier,\nand till now he had had no suspicion that such a wide, flat,\nlow-lying country lay so near at hand, under the very verge of his\nupland world.  The whole northern semicircle between east and west,\nto a distance of forty or fifty miles, spread itself before him; a\nbluer, moister atmosphere, evidently, than that he breathed up here.\n\nNot far from the road stood a weather-beaten old barn of reddish-grey\nbrick and tile.  It was known as the Brown House by the people of the\nlocality.  He was about to pass it when he perceived a ladder against\nthe eaves; and the reflection that the higher he got, the further he\ncould see, led Jude to stand and regard it.  On the slope of the roof\ntwo men were repairing the tiling.  He turned into the ridgeway and\ndrew towards the barn.\n\nWhen he had wistfully watched the workmen for some time he took\ncourage, and ascended the ladder till he stood beside them.\n\n\"Well, my lad, and what may you want up here?\"\n\n\"I wanted to know where the city of Christminster is, if you please.\"\n\n\"Christminster is out across there, by that clump.  You can see\nit--at least you can on a clear day.  Ah, no, you can't now.\"\n\nThe other tiler, glad of any kind of diversion from the monotony of\nhis labour, had also turned to look towards the quarter designated.\n\"You can't often see it in weather like this,\" he said.  \"The time\nI've noticed it is when the sun is going down in a blaze of flame,\nand it looks like--I don't know what.\"\n\n\"The heavenly Jerusalem,\" suggested the serious urchin.\n\n\"Ay--though I should never ha' thought of it myself.... But I can't\nsee no Christminster to-day.\"\n\nThe boy strained his eyes also; yet neither could he see the far-off\ncity.  He descended from the barn, and abandoning Christminster with\nthe versatility of his age he walked along the ridge-track, looking\nfor any natural objects of interest that might lie in the banks\nthereabout.  When he repassed the barn to go back to Marygreen he\nobserved that the ladder was still in its place, but that the men had\nfinished their day's work and gone away.\n\nIt was waning towards evening; there was still a faint mist, but it\nhad cleared a little except in the damper tracts of subjacent country\nand along the river-courses.  He thought again of Christminster, and\nwished, since he had come two or three miles from his aunt's house\non purpose, that he could have seen for once this attractive city of\nwhich he had been told.  But even if he waited here it was hardly\nlikely that the air would clear before night.  Yet he was loth to\nleave the spot, for the northern expanse became lost to view on\nretreating towards the village only a few hundred yards.\n\nHe ascended the ladder to have one more look at the point the men\nhad designated, and perched himself on the highest rung, overlying\nthe tiles.  He might not be able to come so far as this for many\ndays.  Perhaps if he prayed, the wish to see Christminster might be\nforwarded.  People said that, if you prayed, things sometimes came to\nyou, even though they sometimes did not.  He had read in a tract that\na man who had begun to build a church, and had no money to finish\nit, knelt down and prayed, and the money came in by the next post.\nAnother man tried the same experiment, and the money did not come;\nbut he found afterwards that the breeches he knelt in were made by\na wicked Jew.  This was not discouraging, and turning on the ladder\nJude knelt on the third rung, where, resting against those above it,\nhe prayed that the mist might rise.\n\nHe then seated himself again, and waited.  In the course of ten or\nfifteen minutes the thinning mist dissolved altogether from the\nnorthern horizon, as it had already done elsewhere, and about a\nquarter of an hour before the time of sunset the westward clouds\nparted, the sun's position being partially uncovered, and the beams\nstreaming out in visible lines between two bars of slaty cloud.  The\nboy immediately looked back in the old direction.\n\nSome way within the limits of the stretch of landscape, points of\nlight like the topaz gleamed.  The air increased in transparency with\nthe lapse of minutes, till the topaz points showed themselves to be\nthe vanes, windows, wet roof slates, and other shining spots upon the\nspires, domes, freestone-work, and varied outlines that were faintly\nrevealed.  It was Christminster, unquestionably; either directly\nseen, or miraged in the peculiar atmosphere.\n\nThe spectator gazed on and on till the windows and vanes lost their\nshine, going out almost suddenly like extinguished candles.  The\nvague city became veiled in mist.  Turning to the west, he saw that\nthe sun had disappeared.  The foreground of the scene had grown\nfunereally dark, and near objects put on the hues and shapes of\nchimaeras.\n\nHe anxiously descended the ladder, and started homewards at a run,\ntrying not to think of giants, Herne the Hunter, Apollyon lying in\nwait for Christian, or of the captain with the bleeding hole in his\nforehead and the corpses round him that remutinied every night on\nboard the bewitched ship.  He knew that he had grown out of belief in\nthese horrors, yet he was glad when he saw the church tower and the\nlights in the cottage windows, even though this was not the home of\nhis birth, and his great-aunt did not care much about him.\n\n\n\nInside and round about that old woman's \"shop\" window, with its\ntwenty-four little panes set in lead-work, the glass of some of\nthem oxidized with age, so that you could hardly see the poor penny\narticles exhibited within, and forming part of a stock which a strong\nman could have carried, Jude had his outer being for some long\ntideless time.  But his dreams were as gigantic as his surroundings\nwere small.\n\nThrough the solid barrier of cold cretaceous upland to the northward\nhe was always beholding a gorgeous city--the fancied place he had\nlikened to the new Jerusalem, though there was perhaps more of the\npainter's imagination and less of the diamond merchant's in his\ndreams thereof than in those of the Apocalyptic writer.  And the city\nacquired a tangibility, a permanence, a hold on his life, mainly from\nthe one nucleus of fact that the man for whose knowledge and purposes\nhe had so much reverence was actually living there; not only so, but\nliving among the more thoughtful and mentally shining ones therein.\n\nIn sad wet seasons, though he knew it must rain at Christminster too,\nhe could hardly believe that it rained so drearily there.  Whenever\nhe could get away from the confines of the hamlet for an hour or two,\nwhich was not often, he would steal off to the Brown House on the\nhill and strain his eyes persistently; sometimes to be rewarded by\nthe sight of a dome or spire, at other times by a little smoke, which\nin his estimate had some of the mysticism of incense.\n\nThen the day came when it suddenly occurred to him that if he\nascended to the point of view after dark, or possibly went a mile or\ntwo further, he would see the night lights of the city.  It would be\nnecessary to come back alone, but even that consideration did not\ndeter him, for he could throw a little manliness into his mood, no\ndoubt.\n\nThe project was duly executed.  It was not late when he arrived at\nthe place of outlook, only just after dusk, but a black north-east\nsky, accompanied by a wind from the same quarter, made the occasion\ndark enough.  He was rewarded; but what he saw was not the lamps in\nrows, as he had half expected.  No individual light was visible, only\na halo or glow-fog over-arching the place against the black heavens\nbehind it, making the light and the city seem distant but a mile or\nso.\n\nHe set himself to wonder on the exact point in the glow where the\nschoolmaster might be--he who never communicated with anybody at\nMarygreen now; who was as if dead to them here.  In the glow he\nseemed to see Phillotson promenading at ease, like one of the forms\nin Nebuchadnezzar's furnace.\n\nHe had heard that breezes travelled at the rate of ten miles an hour,\nand the fact now came into his mind.  He parted his lips as he faced\nthe north-east, and drew in the wind as if it were a sweet liquor.\n\n\"You,\" he said, addressing the breeze caressingly \"were in\nChristminster city between one and two hours ago, floating along the\nstreets, pulling round the weather-cocks, touching Mr. Phillotson's\nface, being breathed by him; and now you are here, breathed by\nme--you, the very same.\"\n\nSuddenly there came along this wind something towards him--a message\nfrom the place--from some soul residing there, it seemed.  Surely it\nwas the sound of bells, the voice of the city, faint and musical,\ncalling to him, \"We are happy here!\"\n\nHe had become entirely lost to his bodily situation during this\nmental leap, and only got back to it by a rough recalling.  A few\nyards below the brow of the hill on which he paused a team of horses\nmade its appearance, having reached the place by dint of half an\nhour's serpentine progress from the bottom of the immense declivity.\nThey had a load of coals behind them--a fuel that could only be got\ninto the upland by this particular route.  They were accompanied by a\ncarter, a second man, and a boy, who now kicked a large stone behind\none of the wheels, and allowed the panting animals to have a long\nrest, while those in charge took a flagon off the load and indulged\nin a drink round.\n\nThey were elderly men, and had genial voices.  Jude addressed them,\ninquiring if they had come from Christminster.\n\n\"Heaven forbid, with this load!\" said they.\n\n\"The place I mean is that one yonder.\"  He was getting so\nromantically attached to Christminster that, like a young lover\nalluding to his mistress, he felt bashful at mentioning its name\nagain.  He pointed to the light in the sky--hardly perceptible to\ntheir older eyes.\n\n\"Yes.  There do seem a spot a bit brighter in the nor'-east than\nelsewhere, though I shouldn't ha' noticed it myself, and no doubt it\nmed be Christminster.\"\n\nHere a little book of tales which Jude had tucked up under his arm,\nhaving brought them to read on his way hither before it grew dark,\nslipped and fell into the road.  The carter eyed him while he picked\nit up and straightened the leaves.\n\n\"Ah, young man,\" he observed, \"you'd have to get your head screwed on\nt'other way before you could read what they read there.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked the boy.\n\n\"Oh, they never look at anything that folks like we can understand,\"\nthe carter continued, by way of passing the time.  \"On'y foreign\ntongues used in the days of the Tower of Babel, when no two families\nspoke alike.  They read that sort of thing as fast as a night-hawk\nwill whir.  'Tis all learning there--nothing but learning, except\nreligion.  And that's learning too, for I never could understand it.\nYes, 'tis a serious-minded place.  Not but there's wenches in the\nstreets o' nights...  You know, I suppose, that they raise pa'sons\nthere like radishes in a bed?  And though it do take--how many years,\nBob?--five years to turn a lirruping hobble-de-hoy chap into a solemn\npreaching man with no corrupt passions, they'll do it, if it can be\ndone, and polish un off like the workmen they be, and turn un out wi'\na long face, and a long black coat and waistcoat, and a religious\ncollar and hat, same as they used to wear in the Scriptures, so that\nhis own mother wouldn't know un sometimes....  There, 'tis their\nbusiness, like anybody else's.\"\n\n\"But how should you know\"\n\n\"Now don't you interrupt, my boy.  Never interrupt your senyers.\nMove the fore hoss aside, Bobby; here's som'at coming...  You must\nmind that I be a-talking of the college life.  'Em lives on a lofty\nlevel; there's no gainsaying it, though I myself med not think much\nof 'em.  As we be here in our bodies on this high ground, so be they\nin their minds--noble-minded men enough, no doubt--some on 'em--able\nto earn hundreds by thinking out loud.  And some on 'em be strong\nyoung fellows that can earn a'most as much in silver cups.  As for\nmusic, there's beautiful music everywhere in Christminster.  You med\nbe religious, or you med not, but you can't help striking in your\nhomely note with the rest.  And there's a street in the place--the\nmain street--that ha'n't another like it in the world.  I should\nthink I did know a little about Christminster!\"\n\nBy this time the horses had recovered breath and bent to their\ncollars again.  Jude, throwing a last adoring look at the distant\nhalo, turned and walked beside his remarkably well-informed friend,\nwho had no objection to telling him as they moved on more yet of\nthe city--its towers and halls and churches.  The waggon turned\ninto a cross-road, whereupon Jude thanked the carter warmly for his\ninformation, and said he only wished he could talk half as well about\nChristminster as he.\n\n\"Well, 'tis oonly what has come in my way,\" said the carter\nunboastfully.  \"I've never been there, no more than you; but I've\npicked up the knowledge here and there, and you be welcome to it.\nA-getting about the world as I do, and mixing with all classes of\nsociety, one can't help hearing of things.  A friend o' mine, that\nused to clane the boots at the Crozier Hotel in Christminster when he\nwas in his prime, why, I knowed un as well as my own brother in his\nlater years.\"\n\nJude continued his walk homeward alone, pondering so deeply that\nhe forgot to feel timid.  He suddenly grew older.  It had been the\nyearning of his heart to find something to anchor on, to cling\nto--for some place which he could call admirable.  Should he find\nthat place in this city if he could get there? Would it be a spot in\nwhich, without fear of farmers, or hindrance, or ridicule, he could\nwatch and wait, and set himself to some mighty undertaking like the\nmen of old of whom he had heard?  As the halo had been to his eyes\nwhen gazing at it a quarter of an hour earlier, so was the spot\nmentally to him as he pursued his dark way.\n\n\"It is a city of light,\" he said to himself.\n\n\"The tree of knowledge grows there,\" he added a few steps further on.\n\n\"It is a place that teachers of men spring from and go to.\"\n\n\"It is what you may call a castle, manned by scholarship and\nreligion.\"\n\nAfter this figure he was silent a long while, till he added:\n\n\"It would just suit me.\"\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nWalking somewhat slowly by reason of his concentration, the boy--an\nancient man in some phases of thought, much younger than his years\nin others--was overtaken by a light-footed pedestrian, whom,\nnotwithstanding the gloom, he could perceive to be wearing an\nextraordinarily tall hat, a swallow-tailed coat, and a watch-chain\nthat danced madly and threw around scintillations of sky-light as\nits owner swung along upon a pair of thin legs and noiseless boots.\nJude, beginning to feel lonely, endeavoured to keep up with him.\n\n\"Well, my man!  I'm in a hurry, so you'll have to walk pretty fast\nif you keep alongside of me.  Do you know who I am?\"\n\n\"Yes, I think.  Physician Vilbert?\"\n\n\"Ah--I'm known everywhere, I see!  That comes of being a public\nbenefactor.\"\n\nVilbert was an itinerant quack-doctor, well known to the rustic\npopulation, and absolutely unknown to anybody else, as he, indeed,\ntook care to be, to avoid inconvenient investigations.  Cottagers\nformed his only patients, and his Wessex-wide repute was among them\nalone.  His position was humbler and his field more obscure than\nthose of the quacks with capital and an organized system of\nadvertising.  He was, in fact, a survival.  The distances he\ntraversed on foot were enormous, and extended nearly the whole length\nand breadth of Wessex.  Jude had one day seen him selling a pot of\ncoloured lard to an old woman as a certain cure for a bad leg, the\nwoman arranging to pay a guinea, in instalments of a shilling a\nfortnight, for the precious salve, which, according to the physician,\ncould only be obtained from a particular animal which grazed on\nMount Sinai, and was to be captured only at great risk to life and\nlimb.  Jude, though he already had his doubts about this gentleman's\nmedicines, felt him to be unquestionably a travelled personage, and\none who might be a trustworthy source of information on matters not\nstrictly professional.\n\n\"I s'pose you've been to Christminster, Physician?\"\n\n\"I have--many times,\" replied the long thin man.  \"That's one of my\ncentres.\"\n\n\"It's a wonderful city for scholarship and religion?\"\n\n\"You'd say so, my boy, if you'd seen it.  Why, the very sons of the\nold women who do the washing of the colleges can talk in Latin--not\ngood Latin, that I admit, as a critic: dog-Latin--cat-Latin, as we\nused to call it in my undergraduate days.\"\n\n\"And Greek?\"\n\n\"Well--that's more for the men who are in training for bishops, that\nthey may be able to read the New Testament in the original.\"\n\n\"I want to learn Latin and Greek myself.\"\n\n\"A lofty desire.  You must get a grammar of each tongue.\"\n\n\"I mean to go to Christminster some day.\"\n\n\"Whenever you do, you say that Physician Vilbert is the only\nproprietor of those celebrated pills that infallibly cure all\ndisorders of the alimentary system, as well as asthma and shortness\nof breath.  Two and threepence a box--specially licensed by the\ngovernment stamp.\"\n\n\"Can you get me the grammars if I promise to say it hereabout?\"\n\n\"I'll sell you mine with pleasure--those I used as a student.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you, sir!\" said Jude gratefully, but in gasps, for the\namazing speed of the physician's walk kept him in a dog-trot which\nwas giving him a stitch in the side.\n\n\"I think you'd better drop behind, my young man.  Now I'll tell you\nwhat I'll do.  I'll get you the grammars, and give you a first\nlesson, if you'll remember, at every house in the village, to\nrecommend Physician Vilbert's golden ointment, life-drops, and female\npills.\"\n\n\"Where will you be with the grammars?\"\n\n\"I shall be passing here this day fortnight at precisely this hour of\nfive-and-twenty minutes past seven.  My movements are as truly timed\nas those of the planets in their courses.\"\n\n\"Here I'll be to meet you,\" said Jude.\n\n\"With orders for my medicines?\"\n\n\"Yes, Physician.\"\n\nJude then dropped behind, waited a few minutes to recover breath,\nand went home with a consciousness of having struck a blow for\nChristminster.\n\nThrough the intervening fortnight he ran about and smiled outwardly\nat his inward thoughts, as if they were people meeting and nodding to\nhim--smiled with that singularly beautiful irradiation which is seen\nto spread on young faces at the inception of some glorious idea, as\nif a supernatural lamp were held inside their transparent natures,\ngiving rise to the flattering fancy that heaven lies about them then.\n\nHe honestly performed his promise to the man of many cures, in whom\nhe now sincerely believed, walking miles hither and thither among\nthe surrounding hamlets as the Physician's agent in advance.  On the\nevening appointed he stood motionless on the plateau, at the place\nwhere he had parted from Vilbert, and there awaited his approach.\nThe road-physician was fairly up to time; but, to the surprise of\nJude on striking into his pace, which the pedestrian did not diminish\nby a single unit of force, the latter seemed hardly to recognize his\nyoung companion, though with the lapse of the fortnight the evenings\nhad grown light.  Jude thought it might perhaps be owing to his\nwearing another hat, and he saluted the physician with dignity.\n\n\"Well, my boy?\" said the latter abstractedly.\n\n\"I've come,\" said Jude.\n\n\"You? who are you?  Oh yes--to be sure!  Got any orders, lad?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"  And Jude told him the names and addresses of the cottagers\nwho were willing to test the virtues of the world-renowned pills and\nsalve.  The quack mentally registered these with great care.\n\n\"And the Latin and Greek grammars?\"  Jude's voice trembled with\nanxiety.\n\n\"What about them?\"\n\n\"You were to bring me yours, that you used before you took your\ndegree.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes, yes!  Forgot all about it--all!  So many lives depending on\nmy attention, you see, my man, that I can't give so much thought as I\nwould like to other things.\"\n\nJude controlled himself sufficiently long to make sure of the truth;\nand he repeated, in a voice of dry misery, \"You haven't brought 'em!\"\n\n\"No. But you must get me some more orders from sick people, and I'll\nbring the grammars next time.\"\n\nJude dropped behind.  He was an unsophisticated boy, but the gift of\nsudden insight which is sometimes vouchsafed to children showed him\nall at once what shoddy humanity the quack was made of.  There was to\nbe no intellectual light from this source.  The leaves dropped from\nhis imaginary crown of laurel; he turned to a gate, leant against it,\nand cried bitterly.\n\nThe disappointment was followed by an interval of blankness.  He\nmight, perhaps, have obtained grammars from Alfredston, but to do\nthat required money, and a knowledge of what books to order; and\nthough physically comfortable, he was in such absolute dependence as\nto be without a farthing of his own.\n\nAt this date Mr. Phillotson sent for his pianoforte, and it gave Jude\na lead.  Why should he not write to the schoolmaster, and ask him to\nbe so kind as to get him the grammars in Christminster?  He might\nslip a letter inside the case of the instrument, and it would be\nsure to reach the desired eyes.  Why not ask him to send any old\nsecond-hand copies, which would have the charm of being mellowed by\nthe university atmosphere?\n\nTo tell his aunt of his intention would be to defeat it.  It was\nnecessary to act alone.\n\nAfter a further consideration of a few days he did act, and on the\nday of the piano's departure, which happened to be his next birthday,\nclandestinely placed the letter inside the packing-case, directed to\nhis much-admired friend, being afraid to reveal the operation to his\naunt Drusilla, lest she should discover his motive, and compel him to\nabandon his scheme.\n\nThe piano was despatched, and Jude waited days and weeks, calling\nevery morning at the cottage post office before his great-aunt was\nstirring.  At last a packet did indeed arrive at the village, and he\nsaw from the ends of it that it contained two thin books.  He took it\naway into a lonely place, and sat down on a felled elm to open it.\n\nEver since his first ecstasy or vision of Christminster and its\npossibilities, Jude had meditated much and curiously on the probable\nsort of process that was involved in turning the expressions of one\nlanguage into those of another.  He concluded that a grammar of the\nrequired tongue would contain, primarily, a rule, prescription, or\nclue of the nature of a secret cipher, which, once known, would\nenable him, by merely applying it, to change at will all words of his\nown speech into those of the foreign one.  His childish idea was, in\nfact, a pushing to the extremity of mathematical precision what is\neverywhere known as Grimm's Law--an aggrandizement of rough rules to\nideal completeness.  Thus he assumed that the words of the required\nlanguage were always to be found somewhere latent in the words of the\ngiven language by those who had the art to uncover them, such art\nbeing furnished by the books aforesaid.\n\nWhen, therefore, having noted that the packet bore the postmark of\nChristminster, he cut the string, opened the volumes, and turned to\nthe Latin grammar, which chanced to come uppermost, he could scarcely\nbelieve his eyes.\n\nThe book was an old one--thirty years old, soiled, scribbled\nwantonly over with a strange name in every variety of enmity to the\nletterpress, and marked at random with dates twenty years earlier\nthan his own day.  But this was not the cause of Jude's amazement.\nHe learnt for the first time that there was no law of transmutation,\nas in his innocence he had supposed (there was, in some degree, but\nthe grammarian did not recognize it), but that every word in both\nLatin and Greek was to be individually committed to memory at the\ncost of years of plodding.\n\nJude flung down the books, lay backward along the broad trunk of the\nelm, and was an utterly miserable boy for the space of a quarter of\nan hour.  As he had often done before, he pulled his hat over his\nface and watched the sun peering insidiously at him through the\ninterstices of the straw.  This was Latin and Greek, then, was it\nthis grand delusion!  The charm he had supposed in store for him was\nreally a labour like that of Israel in Egypt.\n\nWhat brains they must have in Christminster and the great schools, he\npresently thought, to learn words one by one up to tens of thousands!\nThere were no brains in his head equal to this business; and as the\nlittle sun-rays continued to stream in through his hat at him, he\nwished he had never seen a book, that he might never see another,\nthat he had never been born.\n\nSomebody might have come along that way who would have asked him his\ntrouble, and might have cheered him by saying that his notions were\nfurther advanced than those of his grammarian.  But nobody did come,\nbecause nobody does; and under the crushing recognition of his\ngigantic error Jude continued to wish himself out of the world.\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nDuring the three or four succeeding years a quaint and singular\nvehicle might have been discerned moving along the lanes and by-roads\nnear Marygreen, driven in a quaint and singular way.\n\nIn the course of a month or two after the receipt of the books\nJude had grown callous to the shabby trick played him by the dead\nlanguages.  In fact, his disappointment at the nature of those\ntongues had, after a while, been the means of still further\nglorifying the erudition of Christminster.  To acquire languages,\ndeparted or living in spite of such obstinacies as he now knew them\ninherently to possess, was a herculean performance which gradually\nled him on to a greater interest in it than in the presupposed patent\nprocess.  The mountain-weight of material under which the ideas lay\nin those dusty volumes called the classics piqued him into a dogged,\nmouselike subtlety of attempt to move it piecemeal.\n\nHe had endeavoured to make his presence tolerable to his crusty\nmaiden aunt by assisting her to the best of his ability, and the\nbusiness of the little cottage bakery had grown in consequence.  An\naged horse with a hanging head had been purchased for eight pounds at\na sale, a creaking cart with a whity-brown tilt obtained for a few\npounds more, and in this turn-out it became Jude's business thrice a\nweek to carry loaves of bread to the villagers and solitary cotters\nimmediately round Marygreen.\n\nThe singularity aforesaid lay, after all, less in the conveyance\nitself than in Jude's manner of conducting it along its route.\nIts interior was the scene of most of Jude's education by \"private\nstudy.\"  As soon as the horse had learnt the road and the houses\nat which he was to pause awhile, the boy, seated in front, would\nslip the reins over his arm, ingeniously fix open, by means of a\nstrap attached to the tilt, the volume he was reading, spread the\ndictionary on his knees, and plunge into the simpler passages from\nCaesar, Virgil, or Horace, as the case might be, in his purblind\nstumbling way, and with an expenditure of labour that would have made\na tender-hearted pedagogue shed tears; yet somehow getting at the\nmeaning of what he read, and divining rather than beholding the\nspirit of the original, which often to his mind was something else\nthan that which he was taught to look for.\n\nThe only copies he had been able to lay hands on were old Delphin\neditions, because they were superseded, and therefore cheap.  But,\nbad for idle schoolboys, it did so happen that they were passably\ngood for him.  The hampered and lonely itinerant conscientiously\ncovered up the marginal readings, and used them merely on points of\nconstruction, as he would have used a comrade or tutor who should\nhave happened to be passing by.  And though Jude may have had little\nchance of becoming a scholar by these rough and ready means, he was\nin the way of getting into the groove he wished to follow.\n\nWhile he was busied with these ancient pages, which had already been\nthumbed by hands possibly in the grave, digging out the thoughts\nof these minds so remote yet so near, the bony old horse pursued\nhis rounds, and Jude would be aroused from the woes of Dido by the\nstoppage of his cart and the voice of some old woman crying, \"Two\nto-day, baker, and I return this stale one.\"\n\nHe was frequently met in the lanes by pedestrians and others without\nhis seeing them, and by degrees the people of the neighbourhood\nbegan to talk about his method of combining work and play (such they\nconsidered his reading to be), which, though probably convenient\nenough to himself, was not altogether a safe proceeding for other\ntravellers along the same roads.  There were murmurs.  Then a private\nresident of an adjoining place informed the local policeman that the\nbaker's boy should not be allowed to read while driving, and insisted\nthat it was the constable's duty to catch him in the act, and\ntake him to the police court at Alfredston, and get him fined for\ndangerous practices on the highway.  The policeman thereupon lay in\nwait for Jude, and one day accosted him and cautioned him.\n\nAs Jude had to get up at three o'clock in the morning to heat the\noven, and mix and set in the bread that he distributed later in the\nday, he was obliged to go to bed at night immediately after laying\nthe sponge; so that if he could not read his classics on the highways\nhe could hardly study at all.  The only thing to be done was,\ntherefore, to keep a sharp eye ahead and around him as well as he\ncould in the circumstances, and slip away his books as soon as\nanybody loomed in the distance, the policeman in particular.  To do\nthat official justice, he did not put himself much in the way of\nJude's bread-cart, considering that in such a lonely district the\nchief danger was to Jude himself, and often on seeing the white tilt\nover the hedges he would move in another direction.\n\nOn a day when Fawley was getting quite advanced, being now about\nsixteen, and had been stumbling through the \"Carmen S\u00c3\u00a6culare,\" on\nhis way home, he found himself to be passing over the high edge of\nthe plateau by the Brown House.  The light had changed, and it was\nthe sense of this which had caused him to look up.  The sun was going\ndown, and the full moon was rising simultaneously behind the woods in\nthe opposite quarter.  His mind had become so impregnated with the\npoem that, in a moment of the same impulsive emotion which years\nbefore had caused him to kneel on the ladder, he stopped the horse,\nalighted, and glancing round to see that nobody was in sight, knelt\ndown on the roadside bank with open book.  He turned first to the\nshiny goddess, who seemed to look so softly and critically at his\ndoings, then to the disappearing luminary on the other hand, as he\nbegan:\n\n\n\"Phoebe silvarumque potens Diana!\"\n\n\nThe horse stood still till he had finished the hymn, which Jude\nrepeated under the sway of a polytheistic fancy that he would never\nhave thought of humouring in broad daylight.\n\nReaching home, he mused over his curious superstition, innate or\nacquired, in doing this, and the strange forgetfulness which had led\nto such a lapse from common sense and custom in one who wished, next\nto being a scholar, to be a Christian divine.  It had all come of\nreading heathen works exclusively.  The more he thought of it the\nmore convinced he was of his inconsistency.  He began to wonder\nwhether he could be reading quite the right books for his object\nin life.  Certainly there seemed little harmony between this pagan\nliterature and the medi\u00c3\u00a6val colleges at Christminster, that\necclesiastical romance in stone.\n\nUltimately he decided that in his sheer love of reading he had taken\nup a wrong emotion for a Christian young man.  He had dabbled in\nClarke's Homer, but had never yet worked much at the New Testament\nin the Greek, though he possessed a copy, obtained by post from a\nsecond-hand bookseller.  He abandoned the now familiar Ionic for a\nnew dialect, and for a long time onward limited his reading almost\nentirely to the Gospels and Epistles in Griesbach's text.  Moreover,\non going into Alfredston one day, he was introduced to patristic\nliterature by finding at the bookseller's some volumes of the\nFathers which had been left behind by an insolvent clergyman of the\nneighbourhood.\n\nAs another outcome of this change of groove he visited on Sundays all\nthe churches within a walk, and deciphered the Latin inscriptions on\nfifteenth-century brasses and tombs.  On one of these pilgrimages he\nmet with a hunch-backed old woman of great intelligence, who read\neverything she could lay her hands on, and she told him more yet\nof the romantic charms of the city of light and lore.  Thither he\nresolved as firmly as ever to go.\n\nBut how live in that city?  At present he had no income at all.  He\nhad no trade or calling of any dignity or stability whatever on which\nhe could subsist while carrying out an intellectual labour which\nmight spread over many years.\n\nWhat was most required by citizens?  Food, clothing, and shelter.\nAn income from any work in preparing the first would be too meagre;\nfor making the second he felt a distaste; the preparation of the\nthird requisite he inclined to.  They built in a city; therefore he\nwould learn to build.  He thought of his unknown uncle, his cousin\nSusanna's father, an ecclesiastical worker in metal, and somehow\nmedi\u00c3\u00a6val art in any material was a trade for which he had rather a\nfancy.  He could not go far wrong in following his uncle's footsteps,\nand engaging himself awhile with the carcases that contained the\nscholar souls.\n\nAs a preliminary he obtained some small blocks of freestone, metal\nnot being available, and suspending his studies awhile, occupied his\nspare half-hours in copying the heads and capitals in his parish\nchurch.\n\nThere was a stone-mason of a humble kind in Alfredston, and as\nsoon as he had found a substitute for himself in his aunt's little\nbusiness, he offered his services to this man for a trifling wage.\nHere Jude had the opportunity of learning at least the rudiments of\nfreestone-working.  Some time later he went to a church-builder in\nthe same place, and under the architect's direction became handy at\nrestoring the dilapidated masonries of several village churches round\nabout.\n\nNot forgetting that he was only following up this handicraft as\na prop to lean on while he prepared those greater engines which\nhe flattered himself would be better fitted for him, he yet was\ninterested in his pursuit on its own account.  He now had lodgings\nduring the week in the little town, whence he returned to Marygreen\nvillage every Saturday evening.  And thus he reached and passed his\nnineteenth year.\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nAt this memorable date of his life he was, one Saturday, returning\nfrom Alfredston to Marygreen about three o'clock in the afternoon.\nIt was fine, warm, and soft summer weather, and he walked with his\ntools at his back, his little chisels clinking faintly against the\nlarger ones in his basket.  It being the end of the week he had left\nwork early, and had come out of the town by a round-about route which\nhe did not usually frequent, having promised to call at a flour-mill\nnear Cresscombe to execute a commission for his aunt.\n\nHe was in an enthusiastic mood.  He seemed to see his way to living\ncomfortably in Christminster in the course of a year or two, and\nknocking at the doors of one of those strongholds of learning of\nwhich he had dreamed so much.  He might, of course, have gone there\nnow, in some capacity or other, but he preferred to enter the city\nwith a little more assurance as to means than he could be said to\nfeel at present.  A warm self-content suffused him when he considered\nwhat he had already done.  Now and then as he went along he turned\nto face the peeps of country on either side of him.  But he hardly\nsaw them; the act was an automatic repetition of what he had been\naccustomed to do when less occupied; and the one matter which really\nengaged him was the mental estimate of his progress thus far.\n\n\"I have acquired quite an average student's power to read the\ncommon ancient classics, Latin in particular.\"  This was true,\nJude possessing a facility in that language which enabled him with\ngreat ease to himself to beguile his lonely walks by imaginary\nconversations therein.\n\n\"I have read two books of the _Iliad_, besides being pretty familiar\nwith passages such as the speech of Phoenix in the ninth book,\nthe fight of Hector and Ajax in the fourteenth, the appearance of\nAchilles unarmed and his heavenly armour in the eighteenth, and the\nfuneral games in the twenty-third. I have also done some Hesiod, a\nlittle scrap of Thucydides, and a lot of the Greek Testament...  I\nwish there was only one dialect all the same.\n\n\"I have done some mathematics, including the first six and the\neleventh and twelfth books of Euclid; and algebra as far as simple\nequations.\n\n\"I know something of the Fathers, and something of Roman and English\nhistory.\n\n\"These things are only a beginning.  But I shall not make much\nfarther advance here, from the difficulty of getting books.  Hence I\nmust next concentrate all my energies on settling in Christminster.\nOnce there I shall so advance, with the assistance I shall there\nget, that my present knowledge will appear to me but as childish\nignorance.  I must save money, and I will; and one of those colleges\nshall open its doors to me--shall welcome whom now it would spurn,\nif I wait twenty years for the welcome.\n\n\"I'll be D.D. before I have done!\"\n\nAnd then he continued to dream, and thought he might become even a\nbishop by leading a pure, energetic, wise, Christian life.  And what\nan example he would set!  If his income were \u00c2\u00a35000 a year, he would\ngive away \u00c2\u00a34500 in one form and another, and live sumptuously (for\nhim) on the remainder.  Well, on second thoughts, a bishop was\nabsurd.  He would draw the line at an archdeacon.  Perhaps a man\ncould be as good and as learned and as useful in the capacity of\narchdeacon as in that of bishop.  Yet he thought of the bishop again.\n\n\"Meanwhile I will read, as soon as I am settled in Christminster,\nthe books I have not been able to get hold of here: Livy, Tacitus,\nHerodotus, \u00c3\u0086schylus, Sophocles, Aristophanes--\"\n\n\"Ha, ha, ha!  Hoity-toity!\"  The sounds were expressed in light\nvoices on the other side of the hedge, but he did not notice them.\nHis thoughts went on:\n\n\"--Euripides, Plato, Aristotle, Lucretius, Epictetus, Seneca,\nAntoninus.  Then I must master other things: the Fathers thoroughly;\nBede and ecclesiastical history generally; a smattering of Hebrew--I\nonly know the letters as yet--\"\n\n\"Hoity-toity!\"\n\n\"--but I can work hard.  I have staying power in abundance, thank\nGod! and it is that which tells.... Yes, Christminster shall be my\nAlma Mater; and I'll be her beloved son, in whom she shall be well\npleased.\"\n\nIn his deep concentration on these transactions of the future Jude's\nwalk had slackened, and he was now standing quite still, looking\nat the ground as though the future were thrown thereon by a magic\nlantern.  On a sudden something smacked him sharply in the ear, and\nhe became aware that a soft cold substance had been flung at him, and\nhad fallen at his feet.\n\nA glance told him what it was--a piece of flesh, the characteristic\npart of a barrow-pig, which the countrymen used for greasing their\nboots, as it was useless for any other purpose.  Pigs were rather\nplentiful hereabout, being bred and fattened in large numbers in\ncertain parts of North Wessex.\n\nOn the other side of the hedge was a stream, whence, as he now for\nthe first time realized, had come the slight sounds of voices and\nlaughter that had mingled with his dreams.  He mounted the bank and\nlooked over the fence.  On the further side of the stream stood a\nsmall homestead, having a garden and pig-sties attached; in front of\nit, beside the brook, three young women were kneeling, with buckets\nand platters beside them containing heaps of pigs' chitterlings,\nwhich they were washing in the running water.  One or two pairs of\neyes slyly glanced up, and perceiving that his attention had at last\nbeen attracted, and that he was watching them, they braced themselves\nfor inspection by putting their mouths demurely into shape and\nrecommencing their rinsing operations with assiduity.\n\n\"Thank you!\" said Jude severely.\n\n\"I DIDN'T throw it, I tell you!\" asserted one girl to her neighbour,\nas if unconscious of the young man's presence.\n\n\"Nor I,\" the second answered.\n\n\"Oh, Anny, how can you!\" said the third.\n\n\"If I had thrown anything at all, it shouldn't have been THAT!\"\n\n\"Pooh!  I don't care for him!\"  And they laughed and continued their\nwork, without looking up, still ostentatiously accusing each other.\n\nJude grew sarcastic as he wiped his face, and caught their remarks.\n\n\"YOU didn't do it--oh no!\" he said to the up-stream one of the three.\n\nShe whom he addressed was a fine dark-eyed girl, not exactly\nhandsome, but capable of passing as such at a little distance,\ndespite some coarseness of skin and fibre.  She had a round and\nprominent bosom, full lips, perfect teeth, and the rich complexion\nof a Cochin hen's egg.  She was a complete and substantial female\nanimal--no more, no less; and Jude was almost certain that to her was\nattributable the enterprise of attracting his attention from dreams\nof the humaner letters to what was simmering in the minds around him.\n\n\"That you'll never be told,\" said she deedily.\n\n\"Whoever did it was wasteful of other people's property.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's nothing.\"\n\n\"But you want to speak to me, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Oh yes; if you like to.\"\n\n\"Shall I clamber across, or will you come to the plank above here?\"\n\nPerhaps she foresaw an opportunity; for somehow or other the eyes\nof the brown girl rested in his own when he had said the words, and\nthere was a momentary flash of intelligence, a dumb announcement of\naffinity _in posse_ between herself and him, which, so far as Jude\nFawley was concerned, had no sort of premeditation in it.  She saw\nthat he had singled her out from the three, as a woman is singled out\nin such cases, for no reasoned purpose of further acquaintance, but\nin commonplace obedience to conjunctive orders from headquarters,\nunconsciously received by unfortunate men when the last intention of\ntheir lives is to be occupied with the feminine.\n\nSpringing to her feet, she said: \"Bring back what is lying there.\"\n\nJude was now aware that no message on any matter connected with her\nfather's business had prompted her signal to him.  He set down his\nbasket of tools, picked up the scrap of offal, beat a pathway for\nhimself with his stick, and got over the hedge.  They walked in\nparallel lines, one on each bank of the stream, towards the small\nplank bridge.  As the girl drew nearer to it, she gave without Jude\nperceiving it, an adroit little suck to the interior of each of her\ncheeks in succession, by which curious and original manoeuvre she\nbrought as by magic upon its smooth and rotund surface a perfect\ndimple, which she was able to retain there as long as she continued\nto smile.  This production of dimples at will was a not unknown\noperation, which many attempted, but only a few succeeded in\naccomplishing.\n\nThey met in the middle of the plank, and Jude, tossing back her\nmissile, seemed to expect her to explain why she had audaciously\nstopped him by this novel artillery instead of by hailing him.\n\nBut she, slyly looking in another direction, swayed herself backwards\nand forwards on her hand as it clutched the rail of the bridge; till,\nmoved by amatory curiosity, she turned her eyes critically upon him.\n\n\"You don't think _I_ would shy things at you?\"\n\n\"Oh no.\"\n\n\"We are doing this for my father, who naturally doesn't want anything\nthrown away.  He makes that into dubbin.\"  She nodded towards the\nfragment on the grass.\n\n\"What made either of the others throw it, I wonder?\" Jude asked,\npolitely accepting her assertion, though he had very large doubts as\nto its truth.\n\n\"Impudence.  Don't tell folk it was I, mind!\"\n\n\"How can I?  I don't know your name.\"\n\n\"Ah, no.  Shall I tell it to you?\"\n\n\"Do!\"\n\n\"Arabella Donn.  I'm living here.\"\n\n\"I must have known it if I had often come this way.  But I mostly go\nstraight along the high-road.\"\n\n\"My father is a pig-breeder, and these girls are helping me wash the\ninnerds for black-puddings and such like.\"\n\nThey talked a little more and a little more, as they stood regarding\neach other and leaning against the hand-rail of the bridge.  The\nunvoiced call of woman to man, which was uttered very distinctly\nby Arabella's personality, held Jude to the spot against his\nintention--almost against his will, and in a way new to his\nexperience.  It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that till this\nmoment Jude had never looked at a woman to consider her as such, but\nhad vaguely regarded the sex as beings outside his life and purposes.\nHe gazed from her eyes to her mouth, thence to her bosom, and to her\nfull round naked arms, wet, mottled with the chill of the water, and\nfirm as marble.\n\n\"What a nice-looking girl you are!\" he murmured, though the words had\nnot been necessary to express his sense of her magnetism.\n\n\"Ah, you should see me Sundays!\" she said piquantly.\n\n\"I don't suppose I could?\" he answered\n\n\"That's for you to think on.  There's nobody after me just now,\nthough there med be in a week or two.\"  She had spoken this without\na smile, and the dimples disappeared.\n\nJude felt himself drifting strangely, but could not help it.  \"Will\nyou let me?\"\n\n\"I don't mind.\"\n\nBy this time she had managed to get back one dimple by turning\nher face aside for a moment and repeating the odd little sucking\noperation before mentioned, Jude being still unconscious of more than\na general impression of her appearance.  \"Next Sunday?\" he hazarded.\n\"To-morrow, that is?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Shall I call?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nShe brightened with a little glow of triumph, swept him almost\ntenderly with her eyes in turning, and retracing her steps down the\nbrookside grass rejoined her companions.\n\nJude Fawley shouldered his tool-basket and resumed his lonely way,\nfilled with an ardour at which he mentally stood at gaze.  He had\njust inhaled a single breath from a new atmosphere, which had\nevidently been hanging round him everywhere he went, for he knew not\nhow long, but had somehow been divided from his actual breathing as\nby a sheet of glass.  The intentions as to reading, working, and\nlearning, which he had so precisely formulated only a few minutes\nearlier, were suffering a curious collapse into a corner, he knew not\nhow.\n\n\"Well, it's only a bit of fun,\" he said to himself, faintly conscious\nthat to common sense there was something lacking, and still more\nobviously something redundant in the nature of this girl who had\ndrawn him to her which made it necessary that he should assert mere\nsportiveness on his part as his reason in seeking her--something in\nher quite antipathetic to that side of him which had been occupied\nwith literary study and the magnificent Christminster dream.  It had\nbeen no vestal who chose THAT missile for opening her attack on him.\nHe saw this with his intellectual eye, just for a short fleeting\nwhile, as by the light of a falling lamp one might momentarily see an\ninscription on a wall before being enshrouded in darkness.  And then\nthis passing discriminative power was withdrawn, and Jude was lost to\nall conditions of things in the advent of a fresh and wild pleasure,\nthat of having found a new channel for emotional interest hitherto\nunsuspected, though it had lain close beside him.  He was to meet\nthis enkindling one of the other sex on the following Sunday.\n\nMeanwhile the girl had joined her companions, and she silently\nresumed her flicking and sousing of the chitterlings in the pellucid\nstream.\n\n\"Catched un, my dear?\" laconically asked the girl called Anny.\n\n\"I don't know.  I wish I had thrown something else than that!\"\nregretfully murmured Arabella.\n\n\"Lord! he's nobody, though you med think so.  He used to drive old\nDrusilla Fawley's bread-cart out at Marygreen, till he 'prenticed\nhimself at Alfredston.  Since then he's been very stuck up, and\nalways reading.  He wants to be a scholar, they say.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't care what he is, or anything about 'n.  Don't you think\nit, my child!\"\n\n\"Oh, don't ye!  You needn't try to deceive us!  What did you stay\ntalking to him for, if you didn't want un?  Whether you do or whether\nyou don't, he's as simple as a child.  I could see it as you courted\non the bridge, when he looked at 'ee as if he had never seen a woman\nbefore in his born days.  Well, he's to be had by any woman who can\nget him to care for her a bit, if she likes to set herself to catch\nhim the right way.\"\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nThe next day Jude Fawley was pausing in his bedroom with the sloping\nceiling, looking at the books on the table, and then at the black\nmark on the plaster above them, made by the smoke of his lamp in past\nmonths.\n\nIt was Sunday afternoon, four-and-twenty hours after his meeting with\nArabella Donn.  During the whole bygone week he had been resolving to\nset this afternoon apart for a special purpose,--the re-reading of\nhis Greek Testament--his new one, with better type than his old copy,\nfollowing Griesbach's text as amended by numerous correctors, and\nwith variorum readings in the margin.  He was proud of the book,\nhaving obtained it by boldly writing to its London publisher, a thing\nhe had never done before.\n\nHe had anticipated much pleasure in this afternoon's reading, under\nthe quiet roof of his great-aunt's house as formerly, where he now\nslept only two nights a week.  But a new thing, a great hitch, had\nhappened yesterday in the gliding and noiseless current of his life,\nand he felt as a snake must feel who has sloughed off its winter\nskin, and cannot understand the brightness and sensitiveness of its\nnew one.\n\nHe would not go out to meet her, after all.  He sat down, opened the\nbook, and with his elbows firmly planted on the table, and his hands\nto his temples, began at the beginning:\n\n\n   H\u00c3\u008a KAIN\u00c3\u008a DIATH\u00c3\u008aK\u00c3\u008a\n\n\nHad he promised to call for her?  Surely he had!  She would wait\nindoors, poor girl, and waste all her afternoon on account of him.\nThere was a something in her, too, which was very winning, apart from\npromises.  He ought not to break faith with her.  Even though he had\nonly Sundays and week-day evenings for reading he could afford one\nafternoon, seeing that other young men afforded so many.  After\nto-day he would never probably see her again.  Indeed, it would be\nimpossible, considering what his plans were.\n\nIn short, as if materially, a compelling arm of extraordinary\nmuscular power seized hold of him--something which had nothing in\ncommon with the spirits and influences that had moved him hitherto.\nThis seemed to care little for his reason and his will, nothing for\nhis so-called elevated intentions, and moved him along, as a violent\nschoolmaster a schoolboy he has seized by the collar, in a direction\nwhich tended towards the embrace of a woman for whom he had no\nrespect, and whose life had nothing in common with his own except\nlocality.\n\n\nH\u00c3\u008a KAIN\u00c3\u008a DIATH\u00c3\u008aK\u00c3\u008a was no more heeded, and the predestinate Jude\nsprang up and across the room.  Foreseeing such an event he had\nalready arrayed himself in his best clothes.  In three minutes he was\nout of the house and descending by the path across the wide vacant\nhollow of corn-ground which lay between the village and the isolated\nhouse of Arabella in the dip beyond the upland.\n\nAs he walked he looked at his watch.  He could be back in two hours,\neasily, and a good long time would still remain to him for reading\nafter tea.\n\nPassing the few unhealthy fir-trees and cottage where the path\njoined the highway he hastened along, and struck away to the left,\ndescending the steep side of the country to the west of the Brown\nHouse.  Here at the base of the chalk formation he neared the brook\nthat oozed from it, and followed the stream till he reached her\ndwelling.  A smell of piggeries came from the back, and the grunting\nof the originators of that smell.  He entered the garden, and knocked\nat the door with the knob of his stick.\n\nSomebody had seen him through the window, for a male voice on the\ninside said:\n\n\"Arabella!  Here's your young man come coorting!  Mizzle, my girl!\"\n\nJude winced at the words.  Courting in such a businesslike aspect as\nit evidently wore to the speaker was the last thing he was thinking\nof.  He was going to walk with her, perhaps kiss her; but \"courting\"\nwas too coolly purposeful to be anything but repugnant to his ideas.\nThe door was opened and he entered, just as Arabella came downstairs\nin radiant walking attire.\n\n\"Take a chair, Mr. What's-your-name?\" said her father, an energetic,\nblack-whiskered man, in the same businesslike tones Jude had heard\nfrom outside.\n\n\"I'd rather go out at once, wouldn't you?\" she whispered to Jude.\n\n\"Yes,\" said he.  \"We'll walk up to the Brown House and back, we can\ndo it in half an hour.\"\n\nArabella looked so handsome amid her untidy surroundings that he felt\nglad he had come, and all the misgivings vanished that had hitherto\nhaunted him.\n\nFirst they clambered to the top of the great down, during which\nascent he had occasionally to take her hand to assist her.  Then\nthey bore off to the left along the crest into the ridgeway, which\nthey followed till it intersected the high-road at the Brown\nHouse aforesaid, the spot of his former fervid desires to behold\nChristminster.  But he forgot them now.  He talked the commonest\nlocal twaddle to Arabella with greater zest than he would have felt\nin discussing all the philosophies with all the Dons in the recently\nadored university, and passed the spot where he had knelt to Diana\nand Phoebus without remembering that there were any such people in\nthe mythology, or that the sun was anything else than a useful\nlamp for illuminating Arabella's face.  An indescribable lightness\nof heel served to lift him along; and Jude, the incipient scholar,\nprospective D.D., professor, bishop, or what not, felt himself\nhonoured and glorified by the condescension of this handsome country\nwench in agreeing to take a walk with him in her Sunday frock and\nribbons.\n\nThey reached the Brown House barn--the point at which he had planned\nto turn back.  While looking over the vast northern landscape from\nthis spot they were struck by the rising of a dense volume of smoke\nfrom the neighbourhood of the little town which lay beneath them at a\ndistance of a couple of miles.\n\n\"It is a fire,\" said Arabella.  \"Let's run and see it--do!  It is not\nfar!\"\n\nThe tenderness which had grown up in Jude's bosom left him no will to\nthwart her inclination now--which pleased him in affording him excuse\nfor a longer time with her.  They started off down the hill almost at\na trot; but on gaining level ground at the bottom, and walking a\nmile, they found that the spot of the fire was much further off than\nit had seemed.\n\nHaving begun their journey, however, they pushed on; but it was not\ntill five o'clock that they found themselves on the scene,--the\ndistance being altogether about half-a-dozen miles from Marygreen,\nand three from Arabella's.  The conflagration had been got under\nby the time they reached it, and after a short inspection of the\nmelancholy ruins they retraced their steps--their course lying\nthrough the town of Alfredston.\n\nArabella said she would like some tea, and they entered an inn of an\ninferior class, and gave their order.  As it was not for beer they\nhad a long time to wait.  The maid-servant recognized Jude, and\nwhispered her surprise to her mistress in the background, that he,\nthe student \"who kept hisself up so particular,\" should have suddenly\ndescended so low as to keep company with Arabella.  The latter\nguessed what was being said, and laughed as she met the serious and\ntender gaze of her lover--the low and triumphant laugh of a careless\nwoman who sees she is winning her game.\n\nThey sat and looked round the room, and at the picture of Samson and\nDelilah which hung on the wall, and at the circular beer-stains on\nthe table, and at the spittoons underfoot filled with sawdust.  The\nwhole aspect of the scene had that depressing effect on Jude which\nfew places can produce like a tap-room on a Sunday evening when\nthe setting sun is slanting in, and no liquor is going, and the\nunfortunate wayfarer finds himself with no other haven of rest.\n\nIt began to grow dusk.  They could not wait longer, really, for the\ntea, they said.  \"Yet what else can we do?\" asked Jude.  \"It is a\nthree-mile walk for you.\"\n\n\"I suppose we can have some beer,\" said Arabella.\n\n\"Beer, oh yes.  I had forgotten that.  Somehow it seems odd to come\nto a public-house for beer on a Sunday evening.\"\n\n\"But we didn't.\"\n\n\"No, we didn't.\" Jude by this time wished he was out of such an\nuncongenial atmosphere; but he ordered the beer, which was promptly\nbrought.\n\nArabella tasted it.  \"Ugh!\" she said.\n\nJude tasted.  \"What's the matter with it?\" he asked.  \"I don't\nunderstand beer very much now, it is true.  I like it well enough,\nbut it is bad to read on, and I find coffee better.  But this seems\nall right.\"\n\n\"Adulterated--I can't touch it!\"  She mentioned three or four\ningredients that she detected in the liquor beyond malt and hops,\nmuch to Jude's surprise.\n\n\"How much you know!\" he said good-humouredly.\n\nNevertheless she returned to the beer and drank her share, and they\nwent on their way.  It was now nearly dark, and as soon as they had\nwithdrawn from the lights of the town they walked closer together,\ntill they touched each other.  She wondered why he did not put his\narm round her waist, but he did not; he merely said what to himself\nseemed a quite bold enough thing: \"Take my arm.\"\n\nShe took it, thoroughly, up to the shoulder.  He felt the warmth of\nher body against his, and putting his stick under his other arm held\nwith his right hand her right as it rested in its place.\n\n\"Now we are well together, dear, aren't we?\" he observed.\n\n\"Yes,\" said she; adding to herself: \"Rather mild!\"\n\n\"How fast I have become!\" he was thinking.\n\nThus they walked till they reached the foot of the upland, where they\ncould see the white highway ascending before them in the gloom.  From\nthis point the only way of getting to Arabella's was by going up the\nincline, and dipping again into her valley on the right.  Before they\nhad climbed far they were nearly run into by two men who had been\nwalking on the grass unseen.\n\n\"These lovers--you find 'em out o' doors in all seasons and\nweathers--lovers and homeless dogs only,\" said one of the men as\nthey vanished down the hill.\n\nArabella tittered lightly.\n\n\"Are we lovers?\" asked Jude.\n\n\"You know best.\"\n\n\"But you can tell me?\"\n\nFor answer she inclined her head upon his shoulder.  Jude took the\nhint, and encircling her waist with his arm, pulled her to him and\nkissed her.\n\nThey walked now no longer arm in arm but, as she had desired, clasped\ntogether.  After all, what did it matter since it was dark, said Jude\nto himself.  When they were half-way up the long hill they paused as\nby arrangement, and he kissed her again.  They reached the top, and\nhe kissed her once more.\n\n\"You can keep your arm there, if you would like to,\" she said gently.\n\nHe did so, thinking how trusting she was.\n\nThus they slowly went towards her home.  He had left his cottage\nat half-past three, intending to be sitting down again to the New\nTestament by half-past five.  It was nine o'clock when, with another\nembrace, he stood to deliver her up at her father's door.\n\nShe asked him to come in, if only for a minute, as it would seem so\nodd otherwise, and as if she had been out alone in the dark.  He gave\nway, and followed her in.  Immediately that the door was opened he\nfound, in addition to her parents, several neighbours sitting round.\nThey all spoke in a congratulatory manner, and took him seriously as\nArabella's intended partner.\n\nThey did not belong to his set or circle, and he felt out of place\nand embarrassed.  He had not meant this: a mere afternoon of\npleasant walking with Arabella, that was all he had meant.  He did\nnot stay longer than to speak to her stepmother, a simple, quiet\nwoman without features or character; and bidding them all good night\nplunged with a sense of relief into the track over the down.\n\nBut that sense was only temporary: Arabella soon re-asserted her\nsway in his soul.  He walked as if he felt himself to be another man\nfrom the Jude of yesterday.  What were his books to him? what were\nhis intentions, hitherto adhered to so strictly, as to not wasting a\nsingle minute of time day by day?  \"Wasting!\"  It depended on your\npoint of view to define that: he was just living for the first\ntime: not wasting life.  It was better to love a woman than to be a\ngraduate, or a parson; ay, or a pope!\n\nWhen he got back to the house his aunt had gone to bed, and a general\nconsciousness of his neglect seemed written on the face of all things\nconfronting him.  He went upstairs without a light, and the dim\ninterior of his room accosted him with sad inquiry.  There lay his\nbook open, just as he had left it, and the capital letters on the\ntitle-page regarded him with fixed reproach in the grey starlight,\nlike the unclosed eyes of a dead man:\n\n\n   H\u00c3\u008a KAIN\u00c3\u008a DIATH\u00c3\u008aK\u00c3\u008a\n\n\n     *     *     *     *     *     *\n\n\nJude had to leave early next morning for his usual week of absence at\nlodgings; and it was with a sense of futility that he threw into his\nbasket upon his tools and other necessaries the unread book he had\nbrought with him.\n\nHe kept his impassioned doings a secret almost from himself.\nArabella, on the contrary, made them public among all her friends\nand acquaintances.\n\nRetracing by the light of dawn the road he had followed a few hours\nearlier under cover of darkness, with his sweetheart by his side, he\nreached the bottom of the hill, where he walked slowly, and stood\nstill.  He was on the spot where he had given her the first kiss.  As\nthe sun had only just risen it was possible that nobody had passed\nthere since.  Jude looked on the ground and sighed.  He looked\nclosely, and could just discern in the damp dust the imprints of\ntheir feet as they had stood locked in each other's arms.  She was\nnot there now, and \"the embroidery of imagination upon the stuff of\nnature\" so depicted her past presence that a void was in his heart\nwhich nothing could fill.  A pollard willow stood close to the place,\nand that willow was different from all other willows in the world.\nUtter annihilation of the six days which must elapse before he could\nsee her again as he had promised would have been his intensest wish\nif he had had only the week to live.\n\nAn hour and a half later Arabella came along the same way with her\ntwo companions of the Saturday.  She passed unheedingly the scene of\nthe kiss, and the willow that marked it, though chattering freely on\nthe subject to the other two.\n\n\"And what did he tell 'ee next?\"\n\n\"Then he said--\"  And she related almost word for word some of his\ntenderest speeches.  If Jude had been behind the fence he would have\nfelt not a little surprised at learning how very few of his sayings\nand doings on the previous evening were private.\n\n\"You've got him to care for 'ee a bit, 'nation if you han't!\"\nmurmured Anny judicially.  \"It's well to be you!\"\n\nIn a few moments Arabella replied in a curiously low, hungry tone of\nlatent sensuousness: \"I've got him to care for me: yes!  But I want\nhim to more than care for me; I want him to have me--to marry me!  I\nmust have him.  I can't do without him.  He's the sort of man I long\nfor.  I shall go mad if I can't give myself to him altogether!  I\nfelt I should when I first saw him!\"\n\n\"As he is a romancing, straightfor'ard, honest chap, he's to be had,\nand as a husband, if you set about catching him in the right way.\"\n\nArabella remained thinking awhile.  \"What med be the right way?\" she\nasked.\n\n\"Oh you don't know--you don't!\" said Sarah, the third girl.\n\n\"On my word I don't!--No further, that is, than by plain courting,\nand taking care he don't go too far!\"\n\nThe third girl looked at the second.  \"She DON'T know!\"\n\n\"'Tis clear she don't!\" said Anny.\n\n\"And having lived in a town, too, as one may say!  Well, we can teach\n'ee som'at then, as well as you us.\"\n\n\"Yes.  And how do you mean--a sure way to gain a man?  Take me for an\ninnocent, and have done wi' it!\"\n\n\"As a husband.\"\n\n\"As a husband.\"\n\n\"A countryman that's honourable and serious-minded such as he; God\nforbid that I should say a sojer, or sailor, or commercial gent from\nthe towns, or any of them that be slippery with poor women!  I'd do\nno friend that harm!\"\n\n\"Well, such as he, of course!\"\n\nArabella's companions looked at each other, and turning up their eyes\nin drollery began smirking.  Then one went up close to Arabella, and,\nalthough nobody was near, imparted some information in a low tone,\nthe other observing curiously the effect upon Arabella.\n\n\"Ah!\" said the last-named slowly.  \"I own I didn't think of that\nway! ...  But suppose he ISN'T honourable?  A woman had better not\nhave tried it!\"\n\n\"Nothing venture nothing have!  Besides, you make sure that he's\nhonourable before you begin.  You'd be safe enough with yours.  I\nwish I had the chance!  Lots of girls do it; or do you think they'd\nget married at all?\"\n\nArabella pursued her way in silent thought.  \"I'll try it!\" she\nwhispered; but not to them.\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nOne week's end Jude was as usual walking out to his aunt's at\nMarygreen from his lodging in Alfredston, a walk which now had large\nattractions for him quite other than his desire to see his aged and\nmorose relative.  He diverged to the right before ascending the hill\nwith the single purpose of gaining, on his way, a glimpse of Arabella\nthat should not come into the reckoning of regular appointments.\nBefore quite reaching the homestead his alert eye perceived the top\nof her head moving quickly hither and thither over the garden hedge.\nEntering the gate he found that three young unfattened pigs had\nescaped from their sty by leaping clean over the top, and that she\nwas endeavouring unassisted to drive them in through the door which\nshe had set open.  The lines of her countenance changed from the\nrigidity of business to the softness of love when she saw Jude, and\nshe bent her eyes languishingly upon him.  The animals took advantage\nof the pause by doubling and bolting out of the way.\n\n\"They were only put in this morning!\" she cried, stimulated to pursue\nin spite of her lover's presence.  \"They were drove from Spaddleholt\nFarm only yesterday, where Father bought 'em at a stiff price enough.\nThey are wanting to get home again, the stupid toads!  Will you shut\nthe garden gate, dear, and help me to get 'em in.  There are no men\nfolk at home, only Mother, and they'll be lost if we don't mind.\"\n\nHe set himself to assist, and dodged this way and that over the\npotato rows and the cabbages.  Every now and then they ran together,\nwhen he caught her for a moment and kissed her.  The first pig was\ngot back promptly; the second with some difficulty; the third a\nlong-legged creature, was more obstinate and agile.  He plunged\nthrough a hole in the garden hedge, and into the lane.\n\n\"He'll be lost if I don't follow 'n!\" said she.  \"Come along with\nme!\"\n\nShe rushed in full pursuit out of the garden, Jude alongside her,\nbarely contriving to keep the fugitive in sight.  Occasionally they\nwould shout to some boy to stop the animal, but he always wriggled\npast and ran on as before.\n\n\"Let me take your hand, darling,\" said Jude.  \"You are getting out of\nbreath.\"  She gave him her now hot hand with apparent willingness,\nand they trotted along together.\n\n\"This comes of driving 'em home,\" she remarked.  \"They always know\nthe way back if you do that.  They ought to have been carted over.\"\n\nBy this time the pig had reached an unfastened gate admitting to the\nopen down, across which he sped with all the agility his little legs\nafforded.  As soon as the pursuers had entered and ascended to the\ntop of the high ground it became apparent that they would have to run\nall the way to the farmer's if they wished to get at him.  From this\nsummit he could be seen as a minute speck, following an unerring line\ntowards his old home.\n\n\"It is no good!\" cried Arabella.  \"He'll be there long before we get\nthere.  It don't matter now we know he's not lost or stolen on the\nway.  They'll see it is ours, and send un back.  Oh dear, how hot I\nbe!\"\n\nWithout relinquishing her hold of Jude's hand she swerved aside and\nflung herself down on the sod under a stunted thorn, precipitately\npulling Jude on to his knees at the same time.\n\n\"Oh, I ask pardon--I nearly threw you down, didn't I!  But I am so\ntired!\"\n\nShe lay supine, and straight as an arrow, on the sloping sod of this\nhill-top, gazing up into the blue miles of sky, and still retaining\nher warm hold of Jude's hand.  He reclined on his elbow near her.\n\n\"We've run all this way for nothing,\" she went on, her form heaving\nand falling in quick pants, her face flushed, her full red lips\nparted, and a fine dew of perspiration on her skin.  \"Well--why don't\nyou speak, deary?\"\n\n\"I'm blown too.  It was all up hill.\"\n\nThey were in absolute solitude--the most apparent of all solitudes,\nthat of empty surrounding space.  Nobody could be nearer than a mile\nto them without their seeing him.  They were, in fact, on one of the\nsummits of the county, and the distant landscape around Christminster\ncould be discerned from where they lay.  But Jude did not think of\nthat then.\n\n\"Oh, I can see such a pretty thing up this tree,\" said Arabella.  \"A\nsort of a--caterpillar, of the most loveliest green and yellow you\never came across!\"\n\n\"Where?\" said Jude, sitting up.\n\n\"You can't see him there--you must come here,\" said she.\n\nHe bent nearer and put his head in front of hers.  \"No--I can't see\nit,\" he said.\n\n\"Why, on the limb there where it branches off--close to the moving\nleaf--there!\"  She gently pulled him down beside her.\n\n\"I don't see it,\" he repeated, the back of his head against her\ncheek.  \"But I can, perhaps, standing up.\"  He stood accordingly,\nplacing himself in the direct line of her gaze.\n\n\"How stupid you are!\" she said crossly, turning away her face.\n\n\"I don't care to see it, dear: why should I?\" he replied looking\ndown upon her.  \"Get up, Abby.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I want you to let me kiss you.  I've been waiting to ever so long!\"\n\nShe rolled round her face, remained a moment looking deedily aslant\nat him; then with a slight curl of the lip sprang to her feet, and\nexclaiming abruptly \"I must mizzle!\" walked off quickly homeward.\nJude followed and rejoined her.\n\n\"Just one!\" he coaxed.\n\n\"Shan't!\" she said.\n\nHe, surprised: \"What's the matter?\"\n\nShe kept her two lips resentfully together, and Jude followed her\nlike a pet lamb till she slackened her pace and walked beside him,\ntalking calmly on indifferent subjects, and always checking him if\nhe tried to take her hand or clasp her waist.  Thus they descended\nto the precincts of her father's homestead, and Arabella went in,\nnodding good-bye to him with a supercilious, affronted air.\n\n\"I expect I took too much liberty with her, somehow,\" Jude said to\nhimself, as he withdrew with a sigh and went on to Marygreen.\n\nOn Sunday morning the interior of Arabella's home was, as usual,\nthe scene of a grand weekly cooking, the preparation of the special\nSunday dinner.  Her father was shaving before a little glass hung on\nthe mullion of the window, and her mother and Arabella herself were\nshelling beans hard by.  A neighbour passed on her way home from\nmorning service at the nearest church, and seeing Donn engaged at\nthe window with the razor, nodded and came in.\n\nShe at once spoke playfully to Arabella: \"I zeed 'ee running with\n'un--hee-hee! I hope 'tis coming to something?\"\n\nArabella merely threw a look of consciousness into her face without\nraising her eyes.\n\n\"He's for Christminster, I hear, as soon as he can get there.\"\n\n\"Have you heard that lately--quite lately?\" asked Arabella with a\njealous, tigerish indrawing of breath.\n\n\"Oh no!  But it has been known a long time that it is his plan.  He's\non'y waiting here for an opening.  Ah well: he must walk about with\nsomebody, I s'pose.  Young men don't mean much now-a-days. 'Tis a sip\nhere and a sip there with 'em.  'Twas different in my time.\"\n\nWhen the gossip had departed Arabella said suddenly to her mother:\n\"I want you and Father to go and inquire how the Edlins be, this\nevening after tea.  Or no--there's evening service at Fensworth--you\ncan walk to that.\"\n\n\"Oh?  What's up to-night, then?\"\n\n\"Nothing.  Only I want the house to myself.  He's shy; and I can't\nget un to come in when you are here.  I shall let him slip through my\nfingers if I don't mind, much as I care for 'n!\"\n\n\"If it is fine we med as well go, since you wish.\"\n\nIn the afternoon Arabella met and walked with Jude, who had now\nfor weeks ceased to look into a book of Greek, Latin, or any other\ntongue.  They wandered up the slopes till they reached the green\ntrack along the ridge, which they followed to the circular British\nearth-bank adjoining, Jude thinking of the great age of the trackway,\nand of the drovers who had frequented it, probably before the Romans\nknew the country.  Up from the level lands below them floated the\nchime of church bells.  Presently they were reduced to one note,\nwhich quickened, and stopped.\n\n\"Now we'll go back,\" said Arabella, who had attended to the sounds.\n\nJude assented.  So long as he was near her he minded little where he\nwas.  When they arrived at her house he said lingeringly: \"I won't\ncome in.  Why are you in such a hurry to go in to-night?  It is not\nnear dark.\"\n\n\"Wait a moment,\" said she.  She tried the handle of the door and\nfound it locked.\n\n\"Ah--they are gone to church,\" she added.  And searching behind the\nscraper she found the key and unlocked the door.  \"Now, you'll come\nin a moment?\" she asked lightly.  \"We shall be all alone.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Jude with alacrity, the case being unexpectedly\naltered.\n\nIndoors they went.  Did he want any tea?  No, it was too late: he\nwould rather sit and talk to her.  She took off her jacket and hat,\nand they sat down--naturally enough close together.\n\n\"Don't touch me, please,\" she said softly.  \"I am part egg-shell. Or\nperhaps I had better put it in a safe place.\"  She began unfastening\nthe collar of her gown.\n\n\"What is it?\" said her lover.\n\n\"An egg--a cochin's egg.  I am hatching a very rare sort.  I carry it\nabout everywhere with me, and it will get hatched in less than three\nweeks.\"\n\n\"Where do you carry it?\"\n\n\"Just here.\"  She put her hand into her bosom and drew out the egg,\nwhich was wrapped in wool, outside it being a piece of pig's bladder,\nin case of accidents.  Having exhibited it to him she put it back,\n\"Now mind you don't come near me.  I don't want to get it broke, and\nhave to begin another.\"\n\n\"Why do you do such a strange thing?\"\n\n\"It's an old custom.  I suppose it is natural for a woman to want to\nbring live things into the world.\"\n\n\"It is very awkward for me just now,\" he said, laughing.\n\n\"It serves you right.  There--that's all you can have of me\"\n\nShe had turned round her chair, and, reaching over the back of it,\npresented her cheek to him gingerly.\n\n\"That's very shabby of you!\"\n\n\"You should have catched me a minute ago when I had put the egg down!\nThere!\" she said defiantly, \"I am without it now!\"  She had quickly\nwithdrawn the egg a second time; but before he could quite reach her\nshe had put it back as quickly, laughing with the excitement of her\nstrategy.  Then there was a little struggle, Jude making a plunge for\nit and capturing it triumphantly.  Her face flushed; and becoming\nsuddenly conscious he flushed also.\n\nThey looked at each other, panting; till he rose and said: \"One kiss,\nnow I can do it without damage to property; and I'll go!\"\n\nBut she had jumped up too.  \"You must find me first!\" she cried.\n\nHer lover followed her as she withdrew.  It was now dark inside the\nroom, and the window being small he could not discover for a long\ntime what had become of her, till a laugh revealed her to have rushed\nup the stairs, whither Jude rushed at her heels.\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nIt was some two months later in the year, and the pair had met\nconstantly during the interval.  Arabella seemed dissatisfied; she\nwas always imagining, and waiting, and wondering.\n\nOne day she met the itinerant Vilbert.  She, like all the cottagers\nthereabout, knew the quack well, and she began telling him of her\nexperiences.  Arabella had been gloomy, but before he left her she\nhad grown brighter.  That evening she kept an appointment with Jude,\nwho seemed sad.\n\n\"I am going away,\" he said to her.  \"I think I ought to go.  I think\nit will be better both for you and for me.  I wish some things had\nnever begun!  I was much to blame, I know.  But it is never too late\nto mend.\"\n\nArabella began to cry.  \"How do you know it is not too late?\" she\nsaid.  \"That's all very well to say!  I haven't told you yet!\" and\nshe looked into his face with streaming eyes.\n\n\"What?\" he asked, turning pale.  \"Not...?\"\n\n\"Yes!  And what shall I do if you desert me?\"\n\n\"Oh, Arabella--how can you say that, my dear!  You KNOW I wouldn't\ndesert you!\"\n\n\"Well then--\"\n\n\"I have next to no wages as yet, you know; or perhaps I should have\nthought of this before...  But, of course if that's the case, we must\nmarry!  What other thing do you think I could dream of doing?\"\n\n\"I thought--I thought, deary, perhaps you would go away all the more\nfor that, and leave me to face it alone!\"\n\n\"You knew better!  Of course I never dreamt six months ago, or even\nthree, of marrying.  It is a complete smashing up of my plans--I mean\nmy plans before I knew you, my dear.  But what are they, after all!\nDreams about books, and degrees, and impossible fellowships, and all\nthat.  Certainly we'll marry: we must!\"\n\nThat night he went out alone, and walked in the dark self-communing.\nHe knew well, too well, in the secret centre of his brain, that\nArabella was not worth a great deal as a specimen of womankind.\nYet, such being the custom of the rural districts among honourable\nyoung men who had drifted so far into intimacy with a woman as he\nunfortunately had done, he was ready to abide by what he had said,\nand take the consequences.  For his own soothing he kept up a\nfactitious belief in her.  His idea of her was the thing of most\nconsequence, not Arabella herself, he sometimes said laconically.\n\nThe banns were put in and published the very next Sunday.  The people\nof the parish all said what a simple fool young Fawley was.  All his\nreading had only come to this, that he would have to sell his books\nto buy saucepans.  Those who guessed the probable state of affairs,\nArabella's parents being among them, declared that it was the sort of\nconduct they would have expected of such an honest young man as Jude\nin reparation of the wrong he had done his innocent sweetheart.  The\nparson who married them seemed to think it satisfactory too.  And so,\nstanding before the aforesaid officiator, the two swore that at every\nother time of their lives till death took them, they would assuredly\nbelieve, feel, and desire precisely as they had believed, felt, and\ndesired during the few preceding weeks.  What was as remarkable\nas the undertaking itself was the fact that nobody seemed at all\nsurprised at what they swore.\n\nFawley's aunt being a baker she made him a bride-cake, saying\nbitterly that it was the last thing she could do for him, poor silly\nfellow; and that it would have been far better if, instead of his\nliving to trouble her, he had gone underground years before with his\nfather and mother.  Of this cake Arabella took some slices, wrapped\nthem up in white note-paper, and sent them to her companions in the\npork-dressing business, Anny and Sarah, labelling each packet \"_In\nremembrance of good advice_.\"\n\nThe prospects of the newly married couple were certainly not very\nbrilliant even to the most sanguine mind.  He, a stone-mason's\napprentice, nineteen years of age, was working for half wages till\nhe should be out of his time.  His wife was absolutely useless in a\ntown-lodging, where he at first had considered it would be necessary\nfor them to live.  But the urgent need of adding to income in ever so\nlittle a degree caused him to take a lonely roadside cottage between\nthe Brown House and Marygreen, that he might have the profits of a\nvegetable garden, and utilize her past experiences by letting her\nkeep a pig.  But it was not the sort of life he had bargained for,\nand it was a long way to walk to and from Alfredston every day.\nArabella, however, felt that all these make-shifts were temporary;\nshe had gained a husband; that was the thing--a husband with a lot\nof earning power in him for buying her frocks and hats when he should\nbegin to get frightened a bit, and stick to his trade, and throw\naside those stupid books for practical undertakings.\n\nSo to the cottage he took her on the evening of the marriage, giving\nup his old room at his aunt's--where so much of the hard labour at\nGreek and Latin had been carried on.\n\nA little chill overspread him at her first unrobing.  A long tail of\nhair, which Arabella wore twisted up in an enormous knob at the back\nof her head, was deliberately unfastened, stroked out, and hung upon\nthe looking-glass which he had bought her.\n\n\"What--it wasn't your own?\" he said, with a sudden distaste for her.\n\n\"Oh no--it never is nowadays with the better class.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!  Perhaps not in towns.  But in the country it is supposed\nto be different.  Besides, you've enough of your own, surely?\"\n\n\"Yes, enough as country notions go.  But in town the men expect more,\nand when I was barmaid at Aldbrickham--\"\n\n\"Barmaid at Aldbrickham?\"\n\n\"Well, not exactly barmaid--I used to draw the drink at a\npublic-house there--just for a little time; that was all.  Some\npeople put me up to getting this, and I bought it just for a fancy.\nThe more you have the better in Aldbrickham, which is a finer town\nthan all your Christminsters.  Every lady of position wears false\nhair--the barber's assistant told me so.\"\n\nJude thought with a feeling of sickness that though this might be\ntrue to some extent, for all that he knew, many unsophisticated girls\nwould and did go to towns and remain there for years without losing\ntheir simplicity of life and embellishments.  Others, alas, had an\ninstinct towards artificiality in their very blood, and became adepts\nin counterfeiting at the first glimpse of it.  However, perhaps there\nwas no great sin in a woman adding to her hair, and he resolved to\nthink no more of it.\n\nA new-made wife can usually manage to excite interest for a few\nweeks, even though the prospects of the household ways and means\nare cloudy.  There is a certain piquancy about her situation, and\nher manner to her acquaintance at the sense of it, which carries off\nthe gloom of facts, and renders even the humblest bride independent\nawhile of the real.  Mrs. Jude Fawley was walking in the streets of\nAlfredston one market-day with this quality in her carriage when she\nmet Anny her former friend, whom she had not seen since the wedding.\n\nAs usual they laughed before talking; the world seemed funny to them\nwithout saying it.\n\n\"So it turned out a good plan, you see!\" remarked the girl to the\nwife.  \"I knew it would with such as him.  He's a dear good fellow,\nand you ought to be proud of un.\"\n\n\"I am,\" said Mrs. Fawley quietly.\n\n\"And when do you expect?\"\n\n\"Ssh!  Not at all.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"I was mistaken.\"\n\n\"Oh, Arabella, Arabella; you be a deep one!  Mistaken! well, that's\nclever--it's a real stroke of genius!  It is a thing I never thought\no', wi' all my experience!  I never thought beyond bringing about the\nreal thing--not that one could sham it!\"\n\n\"Don't you be too quick to cry sham!  'Twasn't sham.  I didn't know.\"\n\n\"My word--won't he be in a taking!  He'll give it to 'ee o' Saturday\nnights!  Whatever it was, he'll say it was a trick--a double one, by\nthe Lord!\"\n\n\"I'll own to the first, but not to the second... Pooh--he won't\ncare!  He'll be glad I was wrong in what I said.  He'll shake down,\nbless 'ee--men always do.  What can 'em do otherwise?  Married is\nmarried.\"\n\nNevertheless it was with a little uneasiness that Arabella approached\nthe time when in the natural course of things she would have to\nreveal that the alarm she had raised had been without foundation.\nThe occasion was one evening at bedtime, and they were in their\nchamber in the lonely cottage by the wayside to which Jude walked\nhome from his work every day.  He had worked hard the whole twelve\nhours, and had retired to rest before his wife.  When she came into\nthe room he was between sleeping and waking, and was barely conscious\nof her undressing before the little looking-glass as he lay.\n\nOne action of hers, however, brought him to full cognition.  Her face\nbeing reflected towards him as she sat, he could perceive that she\nwas amusing herself by artificially producing in each cheek the\ndimple before alluded to, a curious accomplishment of which she was\nmistress, effecting it by a momentary suction.  It seemed to him for\nthe first time that the dimples were far oftener absent from her face\nduring his intercourse with her nowadays than they had been in the\nearlier weeks of their acquaintance.\n\n\"Don't do that, Arabella!\" he said suddenly.  \"There is no harm in\nit, but--I don't like to see you.\"\n\nShe turned and laughed.  \"Lord, I didn't know you were awake!\" she\nsaid.  \"How countrified you are!  That's nothing.\"\n\n\"Where did you learn it?\"\n\n\"Nowhere that I know of.  They used to stay without any trouble when\nI was at the public-house; but now they won't.  My face was fatter\nthen.\"\n\n\"I don't care about dimples.  I don't think they improve a\nwoman--particularly a married woman, and of full-sized figure like\nyou.\"\n\n\"Most men think otherwise.\"\n\n\"I don't care what most men think, if they do.  How do you know?\"\n\n\"I used to be told so when I was serving in the tap-room.\"\n\n\"Ah--that public-house experience accounts for your knowing about\nthe adulteration of the ale when we went and had some that Sunday\nevening.  I thought when I married you that you had always lived in\nyour father's house.\"\n\n\"You ought to have known better than that, and seen I was a little\nmore finished than I could have been by staying where I was born.\nThere was not much to do at home, and I was eating my head off, so I\nwent away for three months.\"\n\n\"You'll soon have plenty to do now, dear, won't you?\"\n\n\"How do you mean?\"\n\n\"Why, of course--little things to make.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\n\"When will it be?  Can't you tell me exactly, instead of in such\ngeneral terms as you have used?\"\n\n\"Tell you?\"\n\n\"Yes--the date.\"\n\n\"There's nothing to tell.  I made a mistake.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"It was a mistake.\"\n\nHe sat bolt upright in bed and looked at her.  \"How can that be?\"\n\n\"Women fancy wrong things sometimes.\"\n\n\"But--! Why, of course, so unprepared as I was, without a stick of\nfurniture, and hardly a shilling, I shouldn't have hurried on our\naffair, and brought you to a half-furnished hut before I was ready,\nif it had not been for the news you gave me, which made it necessary\nto save you, ready or no...  Good God!\"\n\n\"Don't take on, dear.  What's done can't be undone.\"\n\n\"I have no more to say!\"\n\nHe gave the answer simply, and lay down; and there was silence\nbetween them.\n\nWhen Jude awoke the next morning he seemed to see the world with a\ndifferent eye.  As to the point in question he was compelled to\naccept her word; in the circumstances he could not have acted\notherwise while ordinary notions prevailed.  But how came they to\nprevail?\n\nThere seemed to him, vaguely and dimly, something wrong in a social\nritual which made necessary a cancelling of well-formed schemes\ninvolving years of thought and labour, of foregoing a man's one\nopportunity of showing himself superior to the lower animals, and of\ncontributing his units of work to the general progress of his\ngeneration, because of a momentary surprise by a new and transitory\ninstinct which had nothing in it of the nature of vice, and could be\nonly at the most called weakness.  He was inclined to inquire what he\nhad done, or she lost, for that matter, that he deserved to be caught\nin a gin which would cripple him, if not her also, for the rest of a\nlifetime?  There was perhaps something fortunate in the fact that the\nimmediate reason of his marriage had proved to be non-existent.  But\nthe marriage remained.\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nThe time arrived for killing the pig which Jude and his wife had\nfattened in their sty during the autumn months, and the butchering\nwas timed to take place as soon as it was light in the morning, so\nthat Jude might get to Alfredston without losing more than a quarter\nof a day.\n\nThe night had seemed strangely silent.  Jude looked out of the window\nlong before dawn, and perceived that the ground was covered with\nsnow--snow rather deep for the season, it seemed, a few flakes still\nfalling.\n\n\"I'm afraid the pig-killer won't be able to come,\" he said to\nArabella.\n\n\"Oh, he'll come.  You must get up and make the water hot, if you want\nChallow to scald him.  Though I like singeing best.\"\n\n\"I'll get up,\" said Jude.  \"I like the way of my own county.\"\n\nHe went downstairs, lit the fire under the copper, and began feeding\nit with bean-stalks, all the time without a candle, the blaze\nflinging a cheerful shine into the room; though for him the sense of\ncheerfulness was lessened by thoughts on the reason of that blaze--to\nheat water to scald the bristles from the body of an animal that as\nyet lived, and whose voice could be continually heard from a corner\nof the garden.  At half-past six, the time of appointment with the\nbutcher, the water boiled, and Jude's wife came downstairs.\n\n\"Is Challow come?\" she asked.\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThey waited, and it grew lighter, with the dreary light of a snowy\ndawn.  She went out, gazed along the road, and returning said, \"He's\nnot coming.  Drunk last night, I expect.  The snow is not enough to\nhinder him, surely!\"\n\n\"Then we must put it off.  It is only the water boiled for nothing.\nThe snow may be deep in the valley.\"\n\n\"Can't be put off.  There's no more victuals for the pig.  He ate the\nlast mixing o' barleymeal yesterday morning.\"\n\n\"Yesterday morning?  What has he lived on since?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"What--he has been starving?\"\n\n\"Yes.  We always do it the last day or two, to save bother with the\ninnerds.  What ignorance, not to know that!\"\n\n\"That accounts for his crying so.  Poor creature!\"\n\n\"Well--you must do the sticking--there's no help for it.  I'll show\nyou how.  Or I'll do it myself--I think I could.  Though as it is\nsuch a big pig I had rather Challow had done it.  However, his basket\no' knives and things have been already sent on here, and we can use\n'em.\"\n\n\"Of course you shan't do it,\" said Jude.  \"I'll do it, since it must\nbe done.\"\n\nHe went out to the sty, shovelled away the snow for the space of a\ncouple of yards or more, and placed the stool in front, with the\nknives and ropes at hand.  A robin peered down at the preparations\nfrom the nearest tree, and, not liking the sinister look of the\nscene, flew away, though hungry.  By this time Arabella had joined\nher husband, and Jude, rope in hand, got into the sty, and noosed the\naffrighted animal, who, beginning with a squeak of surprise, rose to\nrepeated cries of rage.  Arabella opened the sty-door, and together\nthey hoisted the victim on to the stool, legs upward, and while Jude\nheld him Arabella bound him down, looping the cord over his legs to\nkeep him from struggling.\n\nThe animal's note changed its quality.  It was not now rage, but the\ncry of despair; long-drawn, slow and hopeless.\n\n\"Upon my soul I would sooner have gone without the pig than have had\nthis to do!\" said Jude.  \"A creature I have fed with my own hands.\"\n\n\"Don't be such a tender-hearted fool!  There's the sticking-knife--\nthe one with the point.  Now whatever you do, don't stick un too\ndeep.\"\n\n\"I'll stick him effectually, so as to make short work of it.  That's\nthe chief thing.\"\n\n\"You must not!\" she cried.  \"The meat must be well bled, and to do\nthat he must die slow.  We shall lose a shilling a score if the meat\nis red and bloody!  Just touch the vein, that's all.  I was brought\nup to it, and I know.  Every good butcher keeps un bleeding long.\nHe ought to be eight or ten minutes dying, at least.\"\n\n\"He shall not be half a minute if I can help it, however the meat may\nlook,\" said Jude determinedly.  Scraping the bristles from the pig's\nupturned throat, as he had seen the butchers do, he slit the fat;\nthen plunged in the knife with all his might.\n\n\"'Od damn it all!\" she cried, \"that ever I should say it!  You've\nover-stuck un!  And I telling you all the time--\"\n\n\"Do be quiet, Arabella, and have a little pity on the creature!\"\n\n\"Hold up the pail to catch the blood, and don't talk!\"\n\nHowever unworkmanlike the deed, it had been mercifully done.  The\nblood flowed out in a torrent instead of in the trickling stream she\nhad desired.  The dying animal's cry assumed its third and final\ntone, the shriek of agony; his glazing eyes riveting themselves on\nArabella with the eloquently keen reproach of a creature recognizing\nat last the treachery of those who had seemed his only friends.\n\n\"Make un stop that!\" said Arabella.  \"Such a noise will bring\nsomebody or other up here, and I don't want people to know we are\ndoing it ourselves.\"  Picking up the knife from the ground whereon\nJude had flung it, she slipped it into the gash, and slit the\nwindpipe.  The pig was instantly silent, his dying breath coming\nthrough the hole.\n\n\"That's better,\" she said.\n\n\"It is a hateful business!\" said he.\n\n\"Pigs must be killed.\"\n\nThe animal heaved in a final convulsion, and, despite the rope,\nkicked out with all his last strength.  A tablespoonful of black\nclot came forth, the trickling of red blood having ceased for some\nseconds.\n\n\"That's it; now he'll go,\" said she.  \"Artful creatures--they always\nkeep back a drop like that as long as they can!\"\n\nThe last plunge had come so unexpectedly as to make Jude stagger, and\nin recovering himself he kicked over the vessel in which the blood\nhad been caught.\n\n\"There!\" she cried, thoroughly in a passion.  \"Now I can't make any\nblackpot.  There's a waste, all through you!\"\n\nJude put the pail upright, but only about a third of the whole\nsteaming liquid was left in it, the main part being splashed over\nthe snow, and forming a dismal, sordid, ugly spectacle--to those who\nsaw it as other than an ordinary obtaining of meat.  The lips and\nnostrils of the animal turned livid, then white, and the muscles of\nhis limbs relaxed.\n\n\"Thank God!\" Jude said.  \"He's dead.\"\n\n\"What's God got to do with such a messy job as a pig-killing, I\nshould like to know!\" she said scornfully.  \"Poor folks must live.\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" said he.  \"I don't scold you.\"\n\nSuddenly they became aware of a voice at hand.\n\n\"Well done, young married volk!  I couldn't have carried it out much\nbetter myself, cuss me if I could!\"  The voice, which was husky,\ncame from the garden-gate, and looking up from the scene of slaughter\nthey saw the burly form of Mr. Challow leaning over the gate,\ncritically surveying their performance.\n\n\"'Tis well for 'ee to stand there and glane!\" said Arabella.  \"Owing\nto your being late the meat is blooded and half spoiled! 'Twon't\nfetch so much by a shilling a score!\"\n\nChallow expressed his contrition.  \"You should have waited a bit\"\nhe said, shaking his head, \"and not have done this--in the delicate\nstate, too, that you be in at present, ma'am.  'Tis risking yourself\ntoo much.\"\n\n\"You needn't be concerned about that,\" said Arabella, laughing.\nJude too laughed, but there was a strong flavour of bitterness in\nhis amusement.\n\nChallow made up for his neglect of the killing by zeal in the\nscalding and scraping.  Jude felt dissatisfied with himself as a man\nat what he had done, though aware of his lack of common sense, and\nthat the deed would have amounted to the same thing if carried out by\ndeputy.  The white snow, stained with the blood of his fellow-mortal,\nwore an illogical look to him as a lover of justice, not to say a\nChristian; but he could not see how the matter was to be mended.  No\ndoubt he was, as his wife had called him, a tender-hearted fool.\n\nHe did not like the road to Alfredston now.  It stared him cynically\nin the face.  The wayside objects reminded him so much of his\ncourtship of his wife that, to keep them out of his eyes, he\nread whenever he could as he walked to and from his work.  Yet\nhe sometimes felt that by caring for books he was not escaping\ncommon-place nor gaining rare ideas, every working-man being of that\ntaste now.  When passing near the spot by the stream on which he had\nfirst made her acquaintance he one day heard voices just as he had\ndone at that earlier time.  One of the girls who had been Arabella's\ncompanions was talking to a friend in a shed, himself being the\nsubject of discourse, possibly because they had seen him in the\ndistance.  They were quite unaware that the shed-walls were so thin\nthat he could hear their words as he passed.\n\n\"Howsomever, 'twas I put her up to it!  'Nothing venture nothing\nhave,' I said.  If I hadn't she'd no more have been his mis'ess than\nI.\"\n\n\"'Tis my belief she knew there was nothing the matter when she told\nhim she was...\"\n\nWhat had Arabella been put up to by this woman, so that he should\nmake her his \"mis'ess,\" otherwise wife?  The suggestion was horridly\nunpleasant, and it rankled in his mind so much that instead of\nentering his own cottage when he reached it he flung his basket\ninside the garden-gate and passed on, determined to go and see his\nold aunt and get some supper there.\n\nThis made his arrival home rather late.  Arabella however, was busy\nmelting down lard from fat of the deceased pig, for she had been out\non a jaunt all day, and so delayed her work.  Dreading lest what he\nhad heard should lead him to say something regrettable to her he\nspoke little.  But Arabella was very talkative, and said among other\nthings that she wanted some money.  Seeing the book sticking out of\nhis pocket she added that he ought to earn more.\n\n\"An apprentice's wages are not meant to be enough to keep a wife on,\nas a rule, my dear.\"\n\n\"Then you shouldn't have had one.\"\n\n\"Come, Arabella!  That's too bad, when you know how it came about.\"\n\n\"I'll declare afore Heaven that I thought what I told you was true.\nDoctor Vilbert thought so.  It was a good job for you that it wasn't\nso!\"\n\n\"I don't mean that,\" he said hastily.  \"I mean before that time.\nI know it was not your fault; but those women friends of yours gave\nyou bad advice.  If they hadn't, or you hadn't taken it, we should at\nthis moment have been free from a bond which, not to mince matters,\ngalls both of us devilishly.  It may be very sad, but it is true.\"\n\n\"Who's been telling you about my friends?  What advice?  I insist\nupon you telling me.\"\n\n\"Pooh--I'd rather not.\"\n\n\"But you shall--you ought to.  It is mean of 'ee not to!\"\n\n\"Very well.\"  And he hinted gently what had been revealed to him.\n\"But I don't wish to dwell upon it.  Let us say no more about it.\"\n\nHer defensive manner collapsed.  \"That was nothing,\" she said,\nlaughing coldly.  \"Every woman has a right to do such as that.  The\nrisk is hers.\"\n\n\"I quite deny it, Bella.  She might if no lifelong penalty attached\nto it for the man, or, in his default, for herself; if the weakness\nof the moment could end with the moment, or even with the year.\nBut when effects stretch so far she should not go and do that which\nentraps a man if he is honest, or herself if he is otherwise.\"\n\n\"What ought I to have done?\"\n\n\"Given me time...  Why do you fuss yourself about melting down that\npig's fat to-night?  Please put it away!\"\n\n\"Then I must do it to-morrow morning.  It won't keep.\"\n\n\"Very well--do.\"\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nNext morning, which was Sunday, she resumed operations about ten\no'clock; and the renewed work recalled the conversation which had\naccompanied it the night before, and put her back into the same\nintractable temper.\n\n\"That's the story about me in Marygreen, is it--that I entrapped 'ee?\nMuch of a catch you were, Lord send!\"  As she warmed she saw some of\nJude's dear ancient classics on a table where they ought not to have\nbeen laid.  \"I won't have them books here in the way!\" she cried\npetulantly; and seizing them one by one she began throwing them upon\nthe floor.\n\n\"Leave my books alone!\" he said.  \"You might have thrown them\naside if you had liked, but as to soiling them like that, it is\ndisgusting!\"  In the operation of making lard Arabella's hands had\nbecome smeared with the hot grease, and her fingers consequently\nleft very perceptible imprints on the book-covers.  She continued\ndeliberately to toss the books severally upon the floor, till Jude,\nincensed beyond bearing, caught her by the arms to make her leave\noff.  Somehow, in going so, he loosened the fastening of her hair,\nand it rolled about her ears.\n\n\"Let me go!\" she said.\n\n\"Promise to leave the books alone.\"\n\nShe hesitated.  \"Let me go!\" she repeated.\n\n\"Promise!\"\n\nAfter a pause: \"I do.\"\n\nJude relinquished his hold, and she crossed the room to the door,\nout of which she went with a set face, and into the highway.  Here\nshe began to saunter up and down, perversely pulling her hair into a\nworse disorder than he had caused, and unfastening several buttons of\nher gown.  It was a fine Sunday morning, dry, clear and frosty, and\nthe bells of Alfredston Church could be heard on the breeze from the\nnorth.  People were going along the road, dressed in their holiday\nclothes; they were mainly lovers--such pairs as Jude and Arabella\nhad been when they sported along the same track some months earlier.\nThese pedestrians turned to stare at the extraordinary spectacle she\nnow presented, bonnetless, her dishevelled hair blowing in the wind,\nher bodice apart, her sleeves rolled above her elbows for her work,\nand her hands reeking with melted fat.  One of the passers said in\nmock terror: \"Good Lord deliver us!\"\n\n\"See how he's served me!\" she cried.  \"Making me work Sunday mornings\nwhen I ought to be going to my church, and tearing my hair off my\nhead, and my gown off my back!\"\n\nJude was exasperated, and went out to drag her in by main force.\nThen he suddenly lost his heat.  Illuminated with the sense that all\nwas over between them, and that it mattered not what she did, or he,\nher husband stood still, regarding her.  Their lives were ruined, he\nthought; ruined by the fundamental error of their matrimonial union:\nthat of having based a permanent contract on a temporary feeling\nwhich had no necessary connection with affinities that alone render\na lifelong comradeship tolerable.\n\n\"Going to ill-use me on principle, as your father ill-used your\nmother, and your father's sister ill-used her husband?\" she asked.\n\"All you be a queer lot as husbands and wives!\"\n\nJude fixed an arrested, surprised look on her.  But she said no more,\nand continued her saunter till she was tired.  He left the spot, and,\nafter wandering vaguely a little while, walked in the direction of\nMarygreen.  Here he called upon his great-aunt, whose infirmities\ndaily increased.\n\n\"Aunt--did my father ill-use my mother, and my aunt her husband?\"\nsaid Jude abruptly, sitting down by the fire.\n\nShe raised her ancient eyes under the rim of the by-gone bonnet that\nshe always wore.  \"Who's been telling you that?\" she said.\n\n\"I have heard it spoken of, and want to know all.\"\n\n\"You med so well, I s'pose; though your wife--I reckon 'twas\nshe--must have been a fool to open up that!  There isn't much to know\nafter all.  Your father and mother couldn't get on together, and they\nparted.  It was coming home from Alfredston market, when you were a\nbaby--on the hill by the Brown House barn--that they had their last\ndifference, and took leave of one another for the last time.  Your\nmother soon afterwards died--she drowned herself, in short, and your\nfather went away with you to South Wessex, and never came here any\nmore.\"\n\nJude recalled his father's silence about North Wessex and Jude's\nmother, never speaking of either till his dying day.\n\n\"It was the same with your father's sister.  Her husband offended\nher, and she so disliked living with him afterwards that she went\naway to London with her little maid.  The Fawleys were not made for\nwedlock: it never seemed to sit well upon us.  There's sommat in our\nblood that won't take kindly to the notion of being bound to do what\nwe do readily enough if not bound.  That's why you ought to have\nhearkened to me, and not ha' married.\"\n\n\"Where did Father and Mother part--by the Brown House, did you say?\"\n\n\"A little further on--where the road to Fenworth branches off, and\nthe handpost stands.  A gibbet once stood there not onconnected with\nour history.  But let that be.\"\n\nIn the dusk of that evening Jude walked away from his old aunt's as\nif to go home.  But as soon as he reached the open down he struck out\nupon it till he came to a large round pond.  The frost continued,\nthough it was not particularly sharp, and the larger stars overhead\ncame out slow and flickering.  Jude put one foot on the edge of the\nice, and then the other: it cracked under his weight; but this did\nnot deter him.  He ploughed his way inward to the centre, the ice\nmaking sharp noises as he went.  When just about the middle he looked\naround him and gave a jump.  The cracking repeated itself; but he did\nnot go down.  He jumped again, but the cracking had ceased.  Jude\nwent back to the edge, and stepped upon the ground.\n\nIt was curious, he thought.  What was he reserved for?  He supposed\nhe was not a sufficiently dignified person for suicide.  Peaceful\ndeath abhorred him as a subject, and would not take him.\n\nWhat could he do of a lower kind than self-extermination; what was\nthere less noble, more in keeping with his present degraded position?\nHe could get drunk.  Of course that was it; he had forgotten.\nDrinking was the regular, stereotyped resource of the despairing\nworthless.  He began to see now why some men boozed at inns.  He\nstruck down the hill northwards and came to an obscure public-house.\nOn entering and sitting down the sight of the picture of Samson and\nDelilah on the wall caused him to recognize the place as that he\nhad visited with Arabella on that first Sunday evening of their\ncourtship.  He called for liquor and drank briskly for an hour or\nmore.\n\nStaggering homeward late that night, with all his sense of\ndepression gone, and his head fairly clear still, he began to laugh\nboisterously, and to wonder how Arabella would receive him in his\nnew aspect.  The house was in darkness when he entered, and in\nhis stumbling state it was some time before he could get a light.\nThen he found that, though the marks of pig-dressing, of fats and\nscallops, were visible, the materials themselves had been taken away.\nA line written by his wife on the inside of an old envelope was\npinned to the cotton blower of the fireplace:\n\n\"_Have gone to my friends.  Shall not return._\"\n\nAll the next day he remained at home, and sent off the carcase of the\npig to Alfredston.  He then cleaned up the premises, locked the door,\nput the key in a place she would know if she came back, and returned\nto his masonry at Alfredston.\n\nAt night when he again plodded home he found she had not visited the\nhouse.  The next day went in the same way, and the next.  Then there\ncame a letter from her.\n\nThat she had gone tired of him she frankly admitted.  He was such\na slow old coach, and she did not care for the sort of life he\nled.  There was no prospect of his ever bettering himself or her.\nShe further went on to say that her parents had, as he knew, for\nsome time considered the question of emigrating to Australia, the\npig-jobbing business being a poor one nowadays.  They had at last\ndecided to go, and she proposed to go with them, if he had no\nobjection.  A woman of her sort would have more chance over there\nthan in this stupid country.\n\nJude replied that he had not the least objection to her going.  He\nthought it a wise course, since she wished to go, and one that might\nbe to the advantage of both.  He enclosed in the packet containing\nthe letter the money that had been realized by the sale of the pig,\nwith all he had besides, which was not much.\n\nFrom that day he heard no more of her except indirectly, though her\nfather and his household did not immediately leave, but waited till\nhis goods and other effects had been sold off.  When Jude learnt\nthat there was to be an auction at the house of the Donns he packed\nhis own household goods into a waggon, and sent them to her at the\naforesaid homestead, that she might sell them with the rest, or as\nmany of them as she should choose.\n\nHe then went into lodgings at Alfredston, and saw in a shopwindow the\nlittle handbill announcing the sale of his father-in-law's furniture.\nHe noted its date, which came and passed without Jude's going near\nthe place, or perceiving that the traffic out of Alfredston by\nthe southern road was materially increased by the auction.  A few\ndays later he entered a dingy broker's shop in the main street\nof the town, and amid a heterogeneous collection of saucepans, a\nclothes-horse, rolling-pin, brass candlestick, swing looking-glass,\nand other things at the back of the shop, evidently just brought in\nfrom a sale, he perceived a framed photograph, which turned out to be\nhis own portrait.\n\nIt was one which he had had specially taken and framed by a local man\nin bird's-eye maple, as a present for Arabella, and had duly given\nher on their wedding-day.  On the back was still to be read, \"_Jude\nto Arabella_,\" with the date.  She must have thrown it in with the\nrest of her property at the auction.\n\n\"Oh,\" said the broker, seeing him look at this and the other articles\nin the heap, and not perceiving that the portrait was of himself,\n\"It is a small lot of stuff that was knocked down to me at a cottage\nsale out on the road to Marygreen.  The frame is a very useful one,\nif you take out the likeness. You shall have it for a shilling.\"\n\nThe utter death of every tender sentiment in his wife, as brought\nhome to him by this mute and undesigned evidence of her sale of\nhis portrait and gift, was the conclusive little stroke required\nto demolish all sentiment in him.  He paid the shilling, took the\nphotograph away with him, and burnt it, frame and all, when he\nreached his lodging.\n\nTwo or three days later he heard that Arabella and her parents had\ndeparted.  He had sent a message offering to see her for a formal\nleave-taking, but she had said that it would be better otherwise,\nsince she was bent on going, which perhaps was true.  On the evening\nfollowing their emigration, when his day's work was done, he came out\nof doors after supper, and strolled in the starlight along the too\nfamiliar road towards the upland whereon had been experienced the\nchief emotions of his life.  It seemed to be his own again.\n\nHe could not realize himself.  On the old track he seemed to be a\nboy still, hardly a day older than when he had stood dreaming at the\ntop of that hill, inwardly fired for the first time with ardours for\nChristminster and scholarship.  \"Yet I am a man,\" he said.  \"I have\na wife.  More, I have arrived at the still riper stage of having\ndisagreed with her, disliked her, had a scuffle with her, and parted\nfrom her.\"\n\nHe remembered then that he was standing not far from the spot at\nwhich the parting between his father and his mother was said to have\noccurred.\n\nA little further on was the summit whence Christminster, or what he\nhad taken for that city, had seemed to be visible.  A milestone, now\nas always, stood at the roadside hard by.  Jude drew near it, and\nfelt rather than read the mileage to the city.  He remembered that\nonce on his way home he had proudly cut with his keen new chisel an\ninscription on the back of that milestone, embodying his aspirations.\nIt had been done in the first week of his apprenticeship, before\nhe had been diverted from his purposes by an unsuitable woman.  He\nwondered if the inscription were legible still, and going to the back\nof the milestone brushed away the nettles.  By the light of a match\nhe could still discern what he had cut so enthusiastically so long\nago:\n\n\n            THITHER\n             J. F.\n   [with a pointing finger]\n\n\nThe sight of it, unimpaired, within its screen of grass and nettles,\nlit in his soul a spark of the old fire.  Surely his plan should\nbe to move onward through good and ill--to avoid morbid sorrow\neven though he did see uglinesses in the world?  _Bene agere et\nloetari_--to do good cheerfully--which he had heard to be the\nphilosophy of one Spinoza, might be his own even now.\n\nHe might battle with his evil star, and follow out his original\nintention.\n\nBy moving to a spot a little way off he uncovered the horizon in a\nnorth-easterly direction.  There actually rose the faint halo, a\nsmall dim nebulousness, hardly recognizable save by the eye of faith.\nIt was enough for him.  He would go to Christminster as soon as the\nterm of his apprenticeship expired.\n\nHe returned to his lodgings in a better mood, and said his prayers.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart Second\n\n\nAT CHRISTMINSTER\n\n\n\n   \"Save his own soul he hath no star.\"--SWINBURNE.\n\n\n   \"Notitiam primosque gradus vicinia fecit;\n         Tempore crevit amor.\"--OVID.\n\n\nI\n\n\nThe next noteworthy move in Jude's life was that in which he appeared\ngliding steadily onward through a dusky landscape of some three\nyears' later leafage than had graced his courtship of Arabella,\nand the disruption of his coarse conjugal life with her.  He was\nwalking towards Christminster City, at a point a mile or two to the\nsouth-west of it.\n\nHe had at last found himself clear of Marygreen and Alfredston: he\nwas out of his apprenticeship, and with his tools at his back seemed\nto be in the way of making a new start--the start to which, barring\nthe interruption involved in his intimacy and married experience with\nArabella, he had been looking forward for about ten years.\n\nJude would now have been described as a young man with a forcible,\nmeditative, and earnest rather than handsome cast of countenance.\nHe was of dark complexion, with dark harmonizing eyes, and he wore\na closely trimmed black beard of more advanced growth than is usual\nat his age; this, with his great mass of black curly hair, was some\ntrouble to him in combing and washing out the stone-dust that settled\non it in the pursuit of his trade.  His capabilities in the latter,\nhaving been acquired in the country, were of an all-round sort,\nincluding monumental stone-cutting, gothic free-stone work for the\nrestoration of churches, and carving of a general kind.  In London\nhe would probably have become specialized and have made himself a\n\"moulding mason,\" a \"foliage sculptor\"--perhaps a \"statuary.\"\n\nHe had that afternoon driven in a cart from Alfredston to the village\nnearest the city in this direction, and was now walking the remaining\nfour miles rather from choice than from necessity, having always\nfancied himself arriving thus.\n\nThe ultimate impulse to come had had a curious origin--one more\nnearly related to the emotional side of him than to the intellectual,\nas is often the case with young men.  One day while in lodgings at\nAlfredston he had gone to Marygreen to see his old aunt, and had\nobserved between the brass candlesticks on her mantlepiece the\nphotograph of a pretty girlish face, in a broad hat with radiating\nfolds under the brim like the rays of a halo.  He had asked who she\nwas.  His grand-aunt had gruffly replied that she was his cousin\nSue Bridehead, of the inimical branch of the family; and on further\nquestioning the old woman had replied that the girl lived in\nChristminster, though she did not know where, or what she was doing.\n\nHis aunt would not give him the photograph.  But it haunted him; and\nultimately formed a quickening ingredient in his latent intent of\nfollowing his friend the school master thither.\n\nHe now paused at the top of a crooked and gentle declivity,\nand obtained his first near view of the city.  Grey-stoned and\ndun-roofed, it stood within hail of the Wessex border, and almost\nwith the tip of one small toe within it, at the northernmost point of\nthe crinkled line along which the leisurely Thames strokes the fields\nof that ancient kingdom.  The buildings now lay quiet in the sunset,\na vane here and there on their many spires and domes giving sparkle\nto a picture of sober secondary and tertiary hues.\n\nReaching the bottom he moved along the level way between pollard\nwillows growing indistinct in the twilight, and soon confronted the\noutmost lamps of the town--some of those lamps which had sent into\nthe sky the gleam and glory that caught his strained gaze in his days\nof dreaming, so many years ago.  They winked their yellow eyes at him\ndubiously, and as if, though they had been awaiting him all these\nyears in disappointment at his tarrying, they did not much want him\nnow.\n\nHe was a species of Dick Whittington whose spirit was touched to\nfiner issues than a mere material gain.  He went along the outlying\nstreets with the cautious tread of an explorer.  He saw nothing of\nthe real city in the suburbs on this side.  His first want being a\nlodging he scrutinized carefully such localities as seemed to offer\non inexpensive terms the modest type of accommodation he demanded;\nand after inquiry took a room in a suburb nicknamed \"Beersheba,\"\nthough he did not know this at the time.  Here he installed himself,\nand having had some tea sallied forth.\n\nIt was a windy, whispering, moonless night.  To guide himself he\nopened under a lamp a map he had brought.  The breeze ruffled and\nfluttered it, but he could see enough to decide on the direction he\nshould take to reach the heart of the place.\n\nAfter many turnings he came up to the first ancient medi\u00c3\u00a6val pile\nthat he had encountered.  It was a college, as he could see by the\ngateway.  He entered it, walked round, and penetrated to dark corners\nwhich no lamplight reached.  Close to this college was another; and\na little further on another; and then he began to be encircled as it\nwere with the breath and sentiment of the venerable city.  When he\npassed objects out of harmony with its general expression he allowed\nhis eyes to slip over them as if he did not see them.\n\nA bell began clanging, and he listened till a hundred-and-one strokes\nhad sounded.  He must have made a mistake, he thought: it was meant\nfor a hundred.\n\nWhen the gates were shut, and he could no longer get into the\nquadrangles, he rambled under the walls and doorways, feeling with\nhis fingers the contours of their mouldings and carving.  The minutes\npassed, fewer and fewer people were visible, and still he serpentined\namong the shadows, for had he not imagined these scenes through\nten bygone years, and what mattered a night's rest for once?  High\nagainst the black sky the flash of a lamp would show crocketed\npinnacles and indented battlements.  Down obscure alleys, apparently\nnever trodden now by the foot of man, and whose very existence seemed\nto be forgotten, there would jut into the path porticoes, oriels,\ndoorways of enriched and florid middle-age design, their extinct air\nbeing accentuated by the rottenness of the stones.  It seemed\nimpossible that modern thought could house itself in such decrepit\nand superseded chambers.\n\nKnowing not a human being here, Jude began to be impressed with\nthe isolation of his own personality, as with a self-spectre, the\nsensation being that of one who walked but could not make himself\nseen or heard.  He drew his breath pensively, and, seeming thus\nalmost his own ghost, gave his thoughts to the other ghostly\npresences with which the nooks were haunted.\n\nDuring the interval of preparation for this venture, since his wife\nand furniture's uncompromising disappearance into space, he had read\nand learnt almost all that could be read and learnt by one in his\nposition, of the worthies who had spent their youth within these\nreverend walls, and whose souls had haunted them in their maturer\nage.  Some of them, by the accidents of his reading, loomed out in\nhis fancy disproportionately large by comparison with the rest.  The\nbrushings of the wind against the angles, buttresses, and door-jambs\nwere as the passing of these only other inhabitants, the tappings\nof each ivy leaf on its neighbour were as the mutterings of their\nmournful souls, the shadows as their thin shapes in nervous movement,\nmaking him comrades in his solitude.  In the gloom it was as if he\nran against them without feeling their bodily frames.\n\nThe streets were now deserted, but on account of these things he\ncould not go in.  There were poets abroad, of early date and of late,\nfrom the friend and eulogist of Shakespeare down to him who has\nrecently passed into silence, and that musical one of the tribe who\nis still among us.  Speculative philosophers drew along, not always\nwith wrinkled foreheads and hoary hair as in framed portraits, but\npink-faced, slim, and active as in youth; modern divines sheeted in\ntheir surplices, among whom the most real to Jude Fawley were the\nfounders of the religious school called Tractarian; the well-known\nthree, the enthusiast, the poet, and the formularist, the echoes\nof whose teachings had influenced him even in his obscure home.\nA start of aversion appeared in his fancy to move them at sight of\nthose other sons of the place, the form in the full-bottomed wig,\nstatesman, rake, reasoner, and sceptic; the smoothly shaven historian\nso ironically civil to Christianity; with others of the same\nincredulous temper, who knew each quad as well as the faithful, and\ntook equal freedom in haunting its cloisters.\n\nHe regarded the statesmen in their various types, men of firmer\nmovement and less dreamy air; the scholar, the speaker, the plodder;\nthe man whose mind grew with his growth in years, and the man whose\nmind contracted with the same.\n\nThe scientists and philologists followed on in his mind-sight in\nan odd impossible combination, men of meditative faces, strained\nforeheads, and weak-eyed as bats with constant research;\nthen official characters--such men as governor-generals and\nlord-lieutenants, in whom he took little interest; chief-justices and\nlord chancellors, silent thin-lipped figures of whom he knew barely\nthe names.  A keener regard attached to the prelates, by reason of\nhis own former hopes.  Of them he had an ample band--some men of\nheart, others rather men of head; he who apologized for the Church\nin Latin; the saintly author of the Evening Hymn; and near them the\ngreat itinerant preacher, hymn-writer, and zealot, shadowed like Jude\nby his matrimonial difficulties.\n\nJude found himself speaking out loud, holding conversations with\nthem as it were, like an actor in a melodrama who apostrophizes the\naudience on the other side of the footlights; till he suddenly ceased\nwith a start at his absurdity.  Perhaps those incoherent words of the\nwanderer were heard within the walls by some student or thinker over\nhis lamp; and he may have raised his head, and wondered what voice it\nwas, and what it betokened.  Jude now perceived that, so far as solid\nflesh went, he had the whole aged city to himself with the exception\nof a belated townsman here and there, and that he seemed to be\ncatching a cold.\n\nA voice reached him out of the shade; a real and local voice:\n\n\"You've been a-settin' a long time on that plinth-stone, young man.\nWhat med you be up to?\"\n\nIt came from a policeman who had been observing Jude without the\nlatter observing him.\n\nJude went home and to bed, after reading up a little about these men\nand their several messages to the world from a book or two that he\nhad brought with him concerning the sons of the university.  As he\ndrew towards sleep various memorable words of theirs that he had\njust been conning seemed spoken by them in muttering utterances;\nsome audible, some unintelligible to him.  One of the spectres (who\nafterwards mourned Christminster as \"the home of lost causes,\" though\nJude did not remember this) was now apostrophizing her thus:\n\n\"Beautiful city! so venerable, so lovely, so unravaged by the fierce\nintellectual life of our century, so serene! ...  Her ineffable charm\nkeeps ever calling us to the true goal of all of us, to the ideal, to\nperfection.\"\n\nAnother voice was that of the Corn Law convert, whose phantom he had\njust seen in the quadrangle with a great bell.  Jude thought his soul\nmight have been shaping the historic words of his master-speech:\n\n\"Sir, I may be wrong, but my impression is that my duty towards a\ncountry threatened with famine requires that that which has been the\nordinary remedy under all similar circumstances should be resorted to\nnow, namely, that there should be free access to the food of man from\nwhatever quarter it may come...  Deprive me of office to-morrow, you\ncan never deprive me of the consciousness that I have exercised the\npowers committed to me from no corrupt or interested motives, from no\ndesire to gratify ambition, for no personal gain.\"\n\nThen the sly author of the immortal Chapter on Christianity: \"How\nshall we excuse the supine inattention of the Pagan and philosophic\nworld, to those evidences [miracles] which were presented by\nOmnipotence? ...  The sages of Greece and Rome turned aside from the\nawful spectacle, and appeared unconscious of any alterations in the\nmoral or physical government of the world.\"\n\nThen the shade of the poet, the last of the optimists:\n\n\n   How the world is made for each of us!\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\n   And each of the Many helps to recruit\n   The life of the race by a general plan.\n\n\nThen one of the three enthusiasts he had seen just now, the author of\nthe _Apologia_:\n\n\"My argument was ... that absolute certitude as to the truths of\nnatural theology was the result of an assemblage of concurring and\nconverging probabilities ... that probabilities which did not reach\nto logical certainty might create a mental certitude.\"\n\nThe second of them, no polemic, murmured quieter things:\n\n\n   Why should we faint, and fear to live alone,\n   Since all alone, so Heaven has will'd, we die?\n\n\nHe likewise heard some phrases spoken by the phantom with the short\nface, the genial Spectator:\n\n\"When I look upon the tombs of the great, every motion of envy dies\nin me; when I read the epitaphs of the beautiful, every inordinate\ndesire goes out; when I meet with the grief of parents upon a\ntombstone, my heart melts with compassion; when I see the tombs of\nthe parents themselves, I consider the vanity of grieving for those\nwhom we must quickly follow.\"\n\nAnd lastly a gentle-voiced prelate spoke, during whose meek, familiar\nrhyme, endeared to him from earliest childhood, Jude fell asleep:\n\n\n     Teach me to live, that I may dread\n     The grave as little as my bed.\n     Teach me to die ...\n\n\nHe did not wake till morning.  The ghostly past seemed to have gone,\nand everything spoke of to-day.  He started up in bed, thinking he\nhad overslept himself and then said:\n\n\"By Jove--I had quite forgotten my sweet-faced cousin, and that she's\nhere all the time! ... and my old schoolmaster, too.\"  His words\nabout his schoolmaster had, perhaps, less zest in them than his words\nconcerning his cousin.\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nNecessary meditations on the actual, including the mean\nbread-and-cheese question, dissipated the phantasmal for a while, and\ncompelled Jude to smother high thinkings under immediate needs.  He\nhad to get up, and seek for work, manual work; the only kind deemed\nby many of its professors to be work at all.\n\nPassing out into the streets on this errand he found that the\ncolleges had treacherously changed their sympathetic countenances:\nsome were pompous; some had put on the look of family vaults above\nground; something barbaric loomed in the masonries of all.  The\nspirits of the great men had disappeared.\n\nThe numberless architectural pages around him he read, naturally,\nless as an artist-critic of their forms than as an artizan and\ncomrade of the dead handicraftsmen whose muscles had actually\nexecuted those forms.  He examined the mouldings, stroked them as\none who knew their beginning, said they were difficult or easy in\nthe working, had taken little or much time, were trying to the arm,\nor convenient to the tool.\n\nWhat at night had been perfect and ideal was by day the more or\nless defective real.  Cruelties, insults, had, he perceived, been\ninflicted on the aged erections.  The condition of several moved him\nas he would have been moved by maimed sentient beings.  They were\nwounded, broken, sloughing off their outer shape in the deadly\nstruggle against years, weather, and man.\n\nThe rottenness of these historical documents reminded him that he was\nnot, after all, hastening on to begin the morning practically as he\nhad intended.  He had come to work, and to live by work, and the\nmorning had nearly gone.  It was, in one sense, encouraging to think\nthat in a place of crumbling stones there must be plenty for one of\nhis trade to do in the business of renovation.  He asked his way to\nthe workyard of the stone-mason whose name had been given him at\nAlfredston; and soon heard the familiar sound of the rubbers and\nchisels.\n\nThe yard was a little centre of regeneration.  Here, with keen edges\nand smooth curves, were forms in the exact likeness of those he had\nseen abraded and time-eaten on the walls.  These were the ideas in\nmodern prose which the lichened colleges presented in old poetry.\nEven some of those antiques might have been called prose when they\nwere new.  They had done nothing but wait, and had become poetical.\nHow easy to the smallest building; how impossible to most men.\n\nHe asked for the foreman, and looked round among the new traceries,\nmullions, transoms, shafts, pinnacles, and battlements standing on\nthe bankers half worked, or waiting to be removed.  They were marked\nby precision, mathematical straightness, smoothness, exactitude:\nthere in the old walls were the broken lines of the original idea;\njagged curves, disdain of precision, irregularity, disarray.\n\nFor a moment there fell on Jude a true illumination; that here in the\nstone yard was a centre of effort as worthy as that dignified by the\nname of scholarly study within the noblest of the colleges.  But he\nlost it under stress of his old idea.  He would accept any employment\nwhich might be offered him on the strength of his late employer's\nrecommendation; but he would accept it as a provisional thing only.\nThis was his form of the modern vice of unrest.\n\nMoreover he perceived that at best only copying, patching and\nimitating went on here; which he fancied to be owing to some\ntemporary and local cause.  He did not at that time see that\nmedi\u00c3\u00a6valism was as dead as a fern-leaf in a lump of coal; that other\ndevelopments were shaping in the world around him, in which Gothic\narchitecture and its associations had no place.  The deadly animosity\nof contemporary logic and vision towards so much of what he held in\nreverence was not yet revealed to him.\n\nHaving failed to obtain work here as yet he went away, and thought\nagain of his cousin, whose presence somewhere at hand he seemed to\nfeel in wavelets of interest, if not of emotion.  How he wished he\nhad that pretty portrait of her!  At last he wrote to his aunt to\nsend it.  She did so, with a request, however, that he was not to\nbring disturbance into the family by going to see the girl or her\nrelations.  Jude, a ridiculously affectionate fellow, promised\nnothing, put the photograph on the mantel-piece, kissed it--he did\nnot know why--and felt more at home.  She seemed to look down and\npreside over his tea.  It was cheering--the one thing uniting him to\nthe emotions of the living city.\n\nThere remained the schoolmaster--probably now a reverend parson.\nBut he could not possibly hunt up such a respectable man just yet;\nso raw and unpolished was his condition, so precarious were his\nfortunes.  Thus he still remained in loneliness.  Although people\nmoved round him he virtually saw none.  Not as yet having mingled\nwith the active life of the place it was largely non-existent to him.\nBut the saints and prophets in the window-tracery, the paintings\nin the galleries, the statues, the busts, the gargoyles, the\ncorbel-heads--these seemed to breathe his atmosphere.  Like all\nnewcomers to a spot on which the past is deeply graven he heard that\npast announcing itself with an emphasis altogether unsuspected by,\nand even incredible to, the habitual residents.\n\nFor many days he haunted the cloisters and quadrangles of the\ncolleges at odd minutes in passing them, surprised by impish\nechoes of his own footsteps, smart as the blows of a mallet.  The\nChristminster \"sentiment,\" as it had been called, ate further and\nfurther into him; till he probably knew more about those buildings\nmaterially, artistically, and historically, than any one of their\ninmates.\n\nIt was not till now, when he found himself actually on the spot of\nhis enthusiasm, that Jude perceived how far away from the object of\nthat enthusiasm he really was.  Only a wall divided him from those\nhappy young contemporaries of his with whom he shared a common mental\nlife; men who had nothing to do from morning till night but to read,\nmark, learn, and inwardly digest.  Only a wall--but what a wall!\n\nEvery day, every hour, as he went in search of labour, he saw them\ngoing and coming also, rubbed shoulders with them, heard their\nvoices, marked their movements.  The conversation of some of the\nmore thoughtful among them seemed oftentimes, owing to his long and\npersistent preparation for this place, to be peculiarly akin to his\nown thoughts.  Yet he was as far from them as if he had been at the\nantipodes.  Of course he was.  He was a young workman in a white\nblouse, and with stone-dust in the creases of his clothes; and in\npassing him they did not even see him, or hear him, rather saw\nthrough him as through a pane of glass at their familiars beyond.\nWhatever they were to him, he to them was not on the spot at all; and\nyet he had fancied he would be close to their lives by coming there.\n\nBut the future lay ahead after all; and if he could only be so\nfortunate as to get into good employment he would put up with the\ninevitable.  So he thanked God for his health and strength, and took\ncourage.  For the present he was outside the gates of everything,\ncolleges included: perhaps some day he would be inside.  Those\npalaces of light and leading; he might some day look down on the\nworld through their panes.\n\nAt length he did receive a message from the stone-mason's yard--that\na job was waiting for him.  It was his first encouragement, and he\nclosed with the offer promptly.\n\nHe was young and strong, or he never could have executed with such\nzest the undertakings to which he now applied himself, since they\ninvolved reading most of the night after working all the day.  First\nhe bought a shaded lamp for four and six-pence, and obtained a good\nlight.  Then he got pens, paper, and such other necessary books as he\nhad been unable to obtain elsewhere.  Then, to the consternation of\nhis landlady, he shifted all the furniture of his room--a single one\nfor living and sleeping--rigged up a curtain on a rope across the\nmiddle, to make a double chamber out of one, hung up a thick blind\nthat nobody should know how he was curtailing the hours of sleep,\nlaid out his books, and sat down.\n\nHaving been deeply encumbered by marrying, getting a cottage, and\nbuying the furniture which had disappeared in the wake of his wife,\nhe had never been able to save any money since the time of those\ndisastrous ventures, and till his wages began to come in he was\nobliged to live in the narrowest way.  After buying a book or two\nhe could not even afford himself a fire; and when the nights reeked\nwith the raw and cold air from the Meadows he sat over his lamp in\na great-coat, hat, and woollen gloves.\n\nFrom his window he could perceive the spire of the cathedral, and the\nogee dome under which resounded the great bell of the city.  The tall\ntower, tall belfry windows, and tall pinnacles of the college by the\nbridge he could also get a glimpse of by going to the staircase.\nThese objects he used as stimulants when his faith in the future was\ndim.\n\nLike enthusiasts in general he made no inquiries into details of\nprocedure.  Picking up general notions from casual acquaintance, he\nnever dwelt upon them.  For the present, he said to himself, the one\nthing necessary was to get ready by accumulating money and knowledge,\nand await whatever chances were afforded to such an one of becoming\na son of the University.  \"For wisdom is a defence, and money is a\ndefence; but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life\nto them that have it.\"  His desire absorbed him, and left no part of\nhim to weigh its practicability.\n\nAt this time he received a nervously anxious letter from his poor old\naunt, on the subject which had previously distressed her--a fear that\nJude would not be strong-minded enough to keep away from his cousin\nSue Bridehead and her relations.  Sue's father, his aunt believed,\nhad gone back to London, but the girl remained at Christminster.  To\nmake her still more objectionable, she was an artist or designer of\nsome sort in what was called an ecclesiastical warehouse, which was\na perfect seed-bed of idolatry, and she was no doubt abandoned to\nmummeries on that account--if not quite a Papist. (Miss Drusilla\nFawley was of her date, Evangelical.)\n\nAs Jude was rather on an intellectual track than a theological, this\nnews of Sue's probable opinions did not much influence him one way or\nthe other, but the clue to her whereabouts was decidedly interesting.\nWith an altogether singular pleasure he walked at his earliest spare\nminutes past the shops answering to his great-aunt's description; and\nbeheld in one of them a young girl sitting behind a desk, who was\nsuspiciously like the original of the portrait.  He ventured to enter\non a trivial errand, and having made his purchase lingered on the\nscene.  The shop seemed to be kept entirely by women.  It contained\nAnglican books, stationery, texts, and fancy goods: little plaster\nangels on brackets, Gothic-framed pictures of saints, ebony crosses\nthat were almost crucifixes, prayer-books that were almost missals.\nHe felt very shy of looking at the girl in the desk; she was so\npretty that he could not believe it possible that she should belong\nto him.  Then she spoke to one of the two older women behind the\ncounter; and he recognized in the accents certain qualities of his\nown voice; softened and sweetened, but his own.  What was she doing?\nHe stole a glance round.  Before her lay a piece of zinc, cut to\nthe shape of a scroll three or four feet long, and coated with a\ndead-surface paint on one side.  Hereon she was designing or\nilluminating, in characters of Church text, the single word\n\n\n   A L L E L U J A\n\n\n\"A sweet, saintly, Christian business, hers!\" thought he.\n\nHer presence here was now fairly enough explained, her skill in\nwork of this sort having no doubt been acquired from her father's\noccupation as an ecclesiastical worker in metal.  The lettering on\nwhich she was engaged was clearly intended to be fixed up in some\nchancel to assist devotion.\n\nHe came out.  It would have been easy to speak to her there and then,\nbut it seemed scarcely honourable towards his aunt to disregard her\nrequest so incontinently.  She had used him roughly, but she had\nbrought him up: and the fact of her being powerless to control him\nlent a pathetic force to a wish that would have been inoperative as\nan argument.\n\nSo Jude gave no sign.  He would not call upon Sue just yet.  He had\nother reasons against doing so when he had walked away.  She seemed\nso dainty beside himself in his rough working-jacket and dusty\ntrousers that he felt he was as yet unready to encounter her, as he\nhad felt about Mr. Phillotson.  And how possible it was that she had\ninherited the antipathies of her family, and would scorn him, as\nfar as a Christian could, particularly when he had told her that\nunpleasant part of his history which had resulted in his becoming\nenchained to one of her own sex whom she would certainly not admire.\n\nThus he kept watch over her, and liked to feel she was there.\nThe consciousness of her living presence stimulated him.  But she\nremained more or less an ideal character, about whose form he began\nto weave curious and fantastic day-dreams.\n\nBetween two and three weeks afterwards Jude was engaged with some\nmore men, outside Crozier College in Old-time Street, in getting a\nblock of worked freestone from a waggon across the pavement, before\nhoisting it to the parapet which they were repairing.  Standing in\nposition the head man said, \"Spaik when he heave! He-ho!\"  And they\nheaved.\n\nAll of a sudden, as he lifted, his cousin stood close to his elbow,\npausing a moment on the bend of her foot till the obstructing object\nshould have been removed.  She looked right into his face with\nliquid, untranslatable eyes, that combined, or seemed to him to\ncombine, keenness with tenderness, and mystery with both, their\nexpression, as well as that of her lips, taking its life from some\nwords just spoken to a companion, and being carried on into his face\nquite unconsciously.  She no more observed his presence than that of\nthe dust-motes which his manipulations raised into the sunbeams.\n\nHis closeness to her was so suggestive that he trembled, and turned\nhis face away with a shy instinct to prevent her recognizing him,\nthough as she had never once seen him she could not possibly do so;\nand might very well never have heard even his name.  He could\nperceive that though she was a country-girl at bottom, a latter\ngirlhood of some years in London, and a womanhood here, had taken\nall rawness out of her.\n\nWhen she was gone he continued his work, reflecting on her.  He had\nbeen so caught by her influence that he had taken no count of her\ngeneral mould and build.  He remembered now that she was not a large\nfigure, that she was light and slight, of the type dubbed elegant.\nThat was about all he had seen.  There was nothing statuesque in her;\nall was nervous motion.  She was mobile, living, yet a painter might\nnot have called her handsome or beautiful.  But the much that she was\nsurprised him.  She was quite a long way removed from the rusticity\nthat was his.  How could one of his cross-grained, unfortunate,\nalmost accursed stock, have contrived to reach this pitch of\nniceness?  London had done it, he supposed.\n\nFrom this moment the emotion which had been accumulating in his\nbreast as the bottled-up effect of solitude and the poetized\nlocality he dwelt in, insensibly began to precipitate itself on this\nhalf-visionary form; and he perceived that, whatever his obedient\nwish in a contrary direction, he would soon be unable to resist the\ndesire to make himself known to her.\n\nHe affected to think of her quite in a family way, since there were\ncrushing reasons why he should not and could not think of her in any\nother.\n\nThe first reason was that he was married, and it would be wrong.\nThe second was that they were cousins.  It was not well for cousins\nto fall in love even when circumstances seemed to favour the passion.\nThe third: even were he free, in a family like his own where marriage\nusually meant a tragic sadness, marriage with a blood-relation would\nduplicate the adverse conditions, and a tragic sadness might be\nintensified to a tragic horror.\n\nTherefore, again, he would have to think of Sue with only a\nrelation's mutual interest in one belonging to him; regard her in\na practical way as some one to be proud of; to talk and nod to;\nlater on, to be invited to tea by, the emotion spent on her being\nrigorously that of a kinsman and well-wisher.  So would she be to him\na kindly star, an elevating power, a companion in Anglican worship,\na tender friend.\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nBut under the various deterrent influences Jude's instinct was to\napproach her timidly, and the next Sunday he went to the morning\nservice in the Cathedral church of Cardinal College to gain a further\nview of her, for he had found that she frequently attended there.\n\nShe did not come, and he awaited her in the afternoon, which was\nfiner.  He knew that if she came at all she would approach the\nbuilding along the eastern side of the great green quadrangle from\nwhich it was accessible, and he stood in a corner while the bell was\ngoing.  A few minutes before the hour for service she appeared as\none of the figures walking along under the college walls, and at\nsight of her he advanced up the side opposite, and followed her into\nthe building, more than ever glad that he had not as yet revealed\nhimself.  To see her, and to be himself unseen and unknown, was\nenough for him at present.\n\nHe lingered awhile in the vestibule, and the service was some way\nadvanced when he was put into a seat.  It was a louring, mournful,\nstill afternoon, when a religion of some sort seems a necessity to\nordinary practical men, and not only a luxury of the emotional\nand leisured classes.  In the dim light and the baffling glare of\nthe clerestory windows he could discern the opposite worshippers\nindistinctly only, but he saw that Sue was among them.  He had not\nlong discovered the exact seat that she occupied when the chanting\nof the 119th Psalm in which the choir was engaged reached its second\npart, _In quo corriget_, the organ changing to a pathetic Gregorian\ntune as the singers gave forth:\n\n\n   Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?\n\n\nIt was the very question that was engaging Jude's attention at this\nmoment.  What a wicked worthless fellow he had been to give vent as\nhe had done to an animal passion for a woman, and allow it to lead\nto such disastrous consequences; then to think of putting an end to\nhimself; then to go recklessly and get drunk.  The great waves of\npedal music tumbled round the choir, and, nursed on the supernatural\nas he had been, it is not wonderful that he could hardly believe that\nthe psalm was not specially set by some regardful Providence for this\nmoment of his first entry into the solemn building.  And yet it was\nthe ordinary psalm for the twenty-fourth evening of the month.\n\nThe girl for whom he was beginning to nourish an extraordinary\ntenderness was at this time ensphered by the same harmonies as those\nwhich floated into his ears; and the thought was a delight to him.\nShe was probably a frequenter of this place, and, steeped body and\nsoul in church sentiment as she must be by occupation and habit, had,\nno doubt, much in common with him.  To an impressionable and lonely\nyoung man the consciousness of having at last found anchorage for\nhis thoughts, which promised to supply both social and spiritual\npossibilities, was like the dew of Hermon, and he remained throughout\nthe service in a sustaining atmosphere of ecstasy.\n\nThough he was loth to suspect it, some people might have said to him\nthat the atmosphere blew as distinctly from Cyprus as from Galilee.\n\nJude waited till she had left her seat and passed under the screen\nbefore he himself moved.  She did not look towards him, and by the\ntime he reached the door she was half-way down the broad path.\nBeing dressed up in his Sunday suit he was inclined to follow her\nand reveal himself.  But he was not quite ready; and, alas, ought\nhe to do so with the kind of feeling that was awakening in him?\n\nFor though it had seemed to have an ecclesiastical basis during the\nservice, and he had persuaded himself that such was the case, he\ncould not altogether be blind to the real nature of the magnetism.\nShe was such a stranger that the kinship was affectation, and he\nsaid, \"It can't be!  I, a man with a wife, must not know her!\"  Still\nSue WAS his own kin, and the fact of his having a wife, even though\nshe was not in evidence in this hemisphere, might be a help in one\nsense.  It would put all thought of a tender wish on his part out\nof Sue's mind, and make her intercourse with him free and fearless.\nIt was with some heartache that he saw how little he cared for the\nfreedom and fearlessness that would result in her from such\nknowledge.\n\n\n\nSome little time before the date of this service in the cathedral the\npretty, liquid-eyed, light-footed young woman, Sue Bridehead, had an\nafternoon's holiday, and leaving the ecclesiastical establishment in\nwhich she not only assisted but lodged, took a walk into the country\nwith a book in her hand.  It was one of those cloudless days which\nsometimes occur in Wessex and elsewhere between days of cold and wet,\nas if intercalated by caprice of the weather-god.  She went along for\na mile or two until she came to much higher ground than that of the\ncity she had left behind her.  The road passed between green fields,\nand coming to a stile Sue paused there, to finish the page she was\nreading, and then looked back at the towers and domes and pinnacles\nnew and old.\n\nOn the other side of the stile, in the footpath, she beheld a\nforeigner with black hair and a sallow face, sitting on the grass\nbeside a large square board whereon were fixed, as closely as they\ncould stand, a number of plaster statuettes, some of them bronzed,\nwhich he was re-arranging before proceeding with them on his way.\nThey were in the main reduced copies of ancient marbles, and\ncomprised divinities of a very different character from those the\ngirl was accustomed to see portrayed, among them being a Venus of\nstandard pattern, a Diana, and, of the other sex, Apollo, Bacchus,\nand Mars.  Though the figures were many yards away from her the\nsouth-west sun brought them out so brilliantly against the green\nherbage that she could discern their contours with luminous\ndistinctness; and being almost in a line between herself and the\nchurch towers of the city they awoke in her an oddly foreign and\ncontrasting set of ideas by comparison.  The man rose, and, seeing\nher, politely took off his cap, and cried, \"I-i-i-mages!\" in an accent\nthat agreed with his appearance.  In a moment he dexterously lifted\nupon his knee the great board with its assembled notabilities divine\nand human, and raised it to the top of his head, bringing them on to\nher and resting the board on the stile.  First he offered her his\nsmaller wares--the busts of kings and queens, then a minstrel, then\na winged Cupid.  She shook her head.\n\n\"How much are these two?\" she said, touching with her finger the\nVenus and the Apollo--the largest figures on the tray.\n\nHe said she should have them for ten shillings.\n\n\"I cannot afford that,\" said Sue.  She offered considerably less,\nand to her surprise the image-man drew them from their wire stay and\nhanded them over the stile.  She clasped them as treasures.\n\nWhen they were paid for, and the man had gone, she began to be\nconcerned as to what she should do with them.  They seemed so very\nlarge now that they were in her possession, and so very naked.\nBeing of a nervous temperament she trembled at her enterprise.\nWhen she handled them the white pipeclay came off on her gloves and\njacket.  After carrying them along a little way openly an idea came\nto her, and, pulling some huge burdock leaves, parsley, and other\nrank growths from the hedge, she wrapped up her burden as well as she\ncould in these, so that what she carried appeared to be an enormous\narmful of green stuff gathered by a zealous lover of nature.\n\n\"Well, anything is better than those everlasting church fallals!\" she\nsaid.  But she was still in a trembling state, and seemed almost to\nwish she had not bought the figures.\n\nOccasionally peeping inside the leaves to see that Venus's arm was\nnot broken, she entered with her heathen load into the most Christian\ncity in the country by an obscure street running parallel to the main\none, and round a corner to the side door of the establishment to\nwhich she was attached.  Her purchases were taken straight up to her\nown chamber, and she at once attempted to lock them in a box that was\nher very own property; but finding them too cumbersome she wrapped\nthem in large sheets of brown paper, and stood them on the floor in a\ncorner.\n\nThe mistress of the house, Miss Fontover, was an elderly lady in\nspectacles, dressed almost like an abbess; a dab at Ritual, as become\none of her business, and a worshipper at the ceremonial church of St.\nSilas, in the suburb of Beersheba before-mentioned, which Jude also\nhad begun to attend.  She was the daughter of a clergyman in reduced\ncircumstances, and at his death, which had occurred several years\nbefore this date, she boldly avoided penury by taking over a little\nshop of church requisites and developing it to its present creditable\nproportions.  She wore a cross and beads round her neck as her only\nornament, and knew the Christian Year by heart.\n\nShe now came to call Sue to tea, and, finding that the girl did not\nrespond for a moment, entered the room just as the other was hastily\nputting a string round each parcel.\n\n\"Something you have been buying, Miss Bridehead?\" she asked,\nregarding the enwrapped objects.\n\n\"Yes--just something to ornament my room,\" said Sue.\n\n\"Well, I should have thought I had put enough here already,\" said\nMiss Fontover, looking round at the Gothic-framed prints of saints,\nthe Church-text scrolls, and other articles which, having become too\nstale to sell, had been used to furnish this obscure chamber.  \"What\nis it?  How bulky!\"  She tore a little hole, about as big as a wafer,\nin the brown paper, and tried to peep in.  \"Why, statuary?  Two\nfigures?  Where did you get them?\"\n\n\"Oh--I bought them of a travelling man who sells casts--\"\n\n\"Two saints?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What ones?\"\n\n\"St. Peter and St.--St. Mary Magdalen.\"\n\n\"Well--now come down to tea, and go and finish that organ-text, if\nthere's light enough afterwards.\"\n\nThese little obstacles to the indulgence of what had been the merest\npassing fancy created in Sue a great zest for unpacking her objects\nand looking at them; and at bedtime, when she was sure of being\nundisturbed, she unrobed the divinities in comfort.  Placing the pair\nof figures on the chest of drawers, a candle on each side of them,\nshe withdrew to the bed, flung herself down thereon, and began\nreading a book she had taken from her box, which Miss Fontover knew\nnothing of.  It was a volume of Gibbon, and she read the chapter\ndealing with the reign of Julian the Apostate.  Occasionally she\nlooked up at the statuettes, which appeared strange and out of place,\nthere happening to be a Calvary print hanging between them, and,\nas if the scene suggested the action, she at length jumped up and\nwithdrew another book from her box--a volume of verse--and turned to\nthe familiar poem--\n\n\n   Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean:\n   The world has grown grey from thy breath!\n\n\nwhich she read to the end.  Presently she put out the candles,\nundressed, and finally extinguished her own light.\n\nShe was of an age which usually sleeps soundly, yet to-night she\nkept waking up, and every time she opened her eyes there was enough\ndiffused light from the street to show her the white plaster figures,\nstanding on the chest of drawers in odd contrast to their environment\nof text and martyr, and the Gothic-framed Crucifix-picture that was\nonly discernible now as a Latin cross, the figure thereon being\nobscured by the shades.\n\nOn one of these occasions the church clocks struck some small hour.\nIt fell upon the ears of another person who sat bending over his\nbooks at a not very distant spot in the same city.  Being Saturday\nnight the morrow was one on which Jude had not set his alarm-clock to\ncall him at his usually early time, and hence he had stayed up, as\nwas his custom, two or three hours later than he could afford to do\non any other day of the week.  Just then he was earnestly reading\nfrom his Griesbach's text.  At the very time that Sue was tossing and\nstaring at her figures, the policeman and belated citizens passing\nalong under his window might have heard, if they had stood still,\nstrange syllables mumbled with fervour within--words that had for\nJude an indescribable enchantment: inexplicable sounds something\nlike these:--\n\n\"_All hemin heis Theos ho Pater, ex hou ta panta, kai hemeis eis\nauton:_\"\n\nTill the sounds rolled with reverent loudness, as a book was heard\nto close:--\n\n\"_Kai heis Kurios Iesous Christos, di hou ta panta kai hemeis di\nautou!_\"\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nHe was a handy man at his trade, an all-round man, as artizans in\ncountry-towns are apt to be.  In London the man who carves the boss\nor knob of leafage declines to cut the fragment of moulding which\nmerges in that leafage, as if it were a degradation to do the second\nhalf of one whole.  When there was not much Gothic moulding for\nJude to run, or much window-tracery on the bankers, he would go out\nlettering monuments or tombstones, and take a pleasure in the change\nof handiwork.\n\nThe next time that he saw her was when he was on a ladder executing\na job of this sort inside one of the churches.  There was a short\nmorning service, and when the parson entered Jude came down from his\nladder, and sat with the half-dozen people forming the congregation,\ntill the prayer should be ended, and he could resume his tapping.  He\ndid not observe till the service was half over that one of the women\nwas Sue, who had perforce accompanied the elderly Miss Fontover\nthither.\n\nJude sat watching her pretty shoulders, her easy, curiously\nnonchalant risings and sittings, and her perfunctory genuflexions,\nand thought what a help such an Anglican would have been to him in\nhappier circumstances.  It was not so much his anxiety to get on with\nhis work that made him go up to it immediately the worshipers began\nto take their leave: it was that he dared not, in this holy spot,\nconfront the woman who was beginning to influence him in such an\nindescribable manner.  Those three enormous reasons why he must\nnot attempt intimate acquaintance with Sue Bridehead, now that his\ninterest in her had shown itself to be unmistakably of a sexual kind,\nloomed as stubbornly as ever.  But it was also obvious that man could\nnot live by work alone; that the particular man Jude, at any rate,\nwanted something to love.  Some men would have rushed incontinently\nto her, snatched the pleasure of easy friendship which she could\nhardly refuse, and have left the rest to chance.  Not so Jude--at\nfirst.\n\nBut as the days, and still more particularly the lonely evenings,\ndragged along, he found himself, to his moral consternation,\nto be thinking more of her instead of thinking less of her, and\nexperiencing a fearful bliss in doing what was erratic, informal, and\nunexpected.  Surrounded by her influence all day, walking past the\nspots she frequented, he was always thinking of her, and was obliged\nto own to himself that his conscience was likely to be the loser in\nthis battle.\n\nTo be sure she was almost an ideality to him still.  Perhaps to know\nher would be to cure himself of this unexpected and unauthorized\npassion.  A voice whispered that, though he desired to know her, he\ndid not desire to be cured.\n\nThere was not the least doubt that from his own orthodox point of\nview the situation was growing immoral.  For Sue to be the loved one\nof a man who was licensed by the laws of his country to love Arabella\nand none other unto his life's end, was a pretty bad second beginning\nwhen the man was bent on such a course as Jude purposed.  This\nconviction was so real with him that one day when, as was frequent,\nhe was at work in a neighbouring village church alone, he felt it to\nbe his duty to pray against his weakness.  But much as he wished to\nbe an exemplar in these things he could not get on.  It was quite\nimpossible, he found, to ask to be delivered from temptation when\nyour heart's desire was to be tempted unto seventy times seven.  So\nhe excused himself.  \"After all,\" he said, \"it is not altogether\nan _erotolepsy_ that is the matter with me, as at that first time.\nI can see that she is exceptionally bright; and it is partly a wish\nfor intellectual sympathy, and a craving for loving-kindness in my\nsolitude.\"  Thus he went on adoring her, fearing to realize that\nit was human perversity.  For whatever Sue's virtues, talents, or\necclesiastical saturation, it was certain that those items were not\nat all the cause of his affection for her.\n\nOn an afternoon at this time a young girl entered the stone-mason's\nyard with some hesitation, and, lifting her skirts to avoid draggling\nthem in the white dust, crossed towards the office.\n\n\"That's a nice girl,\" said one of the men known as Uncle Joe.\n\n\"Who is she?\" asked another.\n\n\"I don't know--I've seen her about here and there.  Why, yes, she's\nthe daughter of that clever chap Bridehead who did all the wrought\nironwork at St. Silas' ten years ago, and went away to London\nafterwards.  I don't know what he's doing now--not much I fancy--as\nshe's come back here.\"\n\nMeanwhile the young woman had knocked at the office door and asked if\nMr. Jude Fawley was at work in the yard.  It so happened that Jude\nhad gone out somewhere or other that afternoon, which information she\nreceived with a look of disappointment, and went away immediately.\nWhen Jude returned they told him, and described her, whereupon he\nexclaimed, \"Why--that's my cousin Sue!\"\n\nHe looked along the street after her, but she was out of sight.  He\nhad no longer any thought of a conscientious avoidance of her, and\nresolved to call upon her that very evening.  And when he reached\nhis lodging he found a note from her--a first note--one of those\ndocuments which, simple and commonplace in themselves, are seen\nretrospectively to have been pregnant with impassioned consequences.\nThe very unconsciousness of a looming drama which is shown in such\ninnocent first epistles from women to men, or _vice versa_, makes\nthem, when such a drama follows, and they are read over by the purple\nor lurid light of it, all the more impressive, solemn, and in cases,\nterrible.\n\nSue's was of the most artless and natural kind.  She addressed him\nas her dear cousin Jude; said she had only just learnt by the merest\naccident that he was living in Christminster, and reproached him with\nnot letting her know.  They might have had such nice times together,\nshe said, for she was thrown much upon herself, and had hardly any\ncongenial friend.  But now there was every probability of her soon\ngoing away, so that the chance of companionship would be lost perhaps\nfor ever.\n\nA cold sweat overspread Jude at the news that she was going away.\nThat was a contingency he had never thought of, and it spurred him\nto write all the more quickly to her.  He would meet her that very\nevening, he said, one hour from the time of writing, at the cross in\nthe pavement which marked the spot of the Martyrdoms.\n\nWhen he had despatched the note by a boy he regretted that in his\nhurry he should have suggested to her to meet him out of doors, when\nhe might have said he would call upon her.  It was, in fact, the\ncountry custom to meet thus, and nothing else had occurred to him.\nArabella had been met in the same way, unfortunately, and it might\nnot seem respectable to a dear girl like Sue.  However, it could not\nbe helped now, and he moved towards the point a few minutes before\nthe hour, under the glimmer of the newly lighted lamps.\n\nThe broad street was silent, and almost deserted, although it was\nnot late.  He saw a figure on the other side, which turned out to\nbe hers, and they both converged towards the crossmark at the same\nmoment.  Before either had reached it she called out to him:\n\n\"I am not going to meet you just there, for the first time in my\nlife!  Come further on.\"\n\nThe voice, though positive and silvery, had been tremulous.  They\nwalked on in parallel lines, and, waiting her pleasure, Jude watched\ntill she showed signs of closing in, when he did likewise, the place\nbeing where the carriers' carts stood in the daytime, though there\nwas none on the spot then.\n\n\"I am sorry that I asked you to meet me, and didn't call,\" began Jude\nwith the bashfulness of a lover.  \"But I thought it would save time\nif we were going to walk.\"\n\n\"Oh--I don't mind that,\" she said with the freedom of a friend.  \"I\nhave really no place to ask anybody in to.  What I meant was that the\nplace you chose was so horrid--I suppose I ought not to say horrid--I\nmean gloomy and inauspicious in its associations...  But isn't it\nfunny to begin like this, when I don't know you yet?\"  She looked him\nup and down curiously, though Jude did not look much at her.\n\n\"You seem to know me more than I know you,\" she added.\n\n\"Yes--I have seen you now and then.\"\n\n\"And you knew who I was, and didn't speak?  And now I am going away!\"\n\n\"Yes.  That's unfortunate.  I have hardly any other friend.  I have,\nindeed, one very old friend here somewhere, but I don't quite like\nto call on him just yet.  I wonder if you know anything of him--Mr.\nPhillotson?  A parson somewhere about the county I think he is.\"\n\n\"No--I only know of one Mr. Phillotson.  He lives a little way out in\nthe country, at Lumsdon.  He's a village schoolmaster.\"\n\n\"Ah!  I wonder if he's the same.  Surely it is impossible!  Only a\nschoolmaster still!  Do you know his Christian name--is it Richard?\"\n\n\"Yes--it is; I've directed books to him, though I've never seen him.\"\n\n\"Then he couldn't do it!\"\n\nJude's countenance fell, for how could he succeed in an enterprise\nwherein the great Phillotson had failed?  He would have had a day of\ndespair if the news had not arrived during his sweet Sue's presence,\nbut even at this moment he had visions of how Phillotson's failure in\nthe grand university scheme would depress him when she had gone.\n\n\"As we are going to take a walk, suppose we go and call upon him?\"\nsaid Jude suddenly.  \"It is not late.\"\n\nShe agreed, and they went along up a hill, and through some prettily\nwooded country.  Presently the embattled tower and square turret\nof the church rose into the sky, and then the school-house. They\ninquired of a person in the street if Mr. Phillotson was likely to\nbe at home, and were informed that he was always at home.  A knock\nbrought him to the school-house door, with a candle in his hand and a\nlook of inquiry on his face, which had grown thin and careworn since\nJude last set eyes on him.\n\nThat after all these years the meeting with Mr. Phillotson should be\nof this homely complexion destroyed at one stroke the halo which had\nsurrounded the school-master's figure in Jude's imagination ever\nsince their parting.  It created in him at the same time a sympathy\nwith Phillotson as an obviously much chastened and disappointed man.\nJude told him his name, and said he had come to see him as an old\nfriend who had been kind to him in his youthful days.\n\n\"I don't remember you in the least,\" said the school-master\nthoughtfully.  \"You were one of my pupils, you say?  Yes, no doubt;\nbut they number so many thousands by this time of my life, and have\nnaturally changed so much, that I remember very few except the quite\nrecent ones.\"\n\n\"It was out at Marygreen,\" said Jude, wishing he had not come.\n\n\"Yes.  I was there a short time.  And is this an old pupil, too?\"\n\n\"No--that's my cousin...  I wrote to you for some grammars, if you\nrecollect, and you sent them?\"\n\n\"Ah--yes!--I do dimly recall that incident.\"\n\n\"It was very kind of you to do it.  And it was you who first started\nme on that course.  On the morning you left Marygreen, when your\ngoods were on the waggon, you wished me good-bye, and said your\nscheme was to be a university man and enter the Church--that a degree\nwas the necessary hall-mark of one who wanted to do anything as a\ntheologian or teacher.\"\n\n\"I remember I thought all that privately; but I wonder I did not keep\nmy own counsel.  The idea was given up years ago.\"\n\n\"I have never forgotten it.  It was that which brought me to this\npart of the country, and out here to see you to-night.\"\n\n\"Come in,\" said Phillotson.  \"And your cousin, too.\"\n\nThey entered the parlour of the school-house, where there was a lamp\nwith a paper shade, which threw the light down on three or four\nbooks.  Phillotson took it off, so that they could see each other\nbetter, and the rays fell on the nervous little face and vivacious\ndark eyes and hair of Sue, on the earnest features of her cousin,\nand on the schoolmaster's own maturer face and figure, showing him\nto be a spare and thoughtful personage of five-and-forty, with a\nthin-lipped, somewhat refined mouth, a slightly stooping habit, and\na black frock coat, which from continued frictions shone a little at\nthe shoulder-blades, the middle of the back, and the elbows.\n\nThe old friendship was imperceptibly renewed, the schoolmaster\nspeaking of his experiences, and the cousins of theirs.  He told them\nthat he still thought of the Church sometimes, and that though he\ncould not enter it as he had intended to do in former years he might\nenter it as a licentiate.  Meanwhile, he said, he was comfortable in\nhis present position, though he was in want of a pupil-teacher.\n\nThey did not stay to supper, Sue having to be indoors before it grew\nlate, and the road was retraced to Christminster.  Though they had\ntalked of nothing more than general subjects, Jude was surprised to\nfind what a revelation of woman his cousin was to him.  She was so\nvibrant that everything she did seemed to have its source in feeling.\nAn exciting thought would make her walk ahead so fast that he could\nhardly keep up with her; and her sensitiveness on some points\nwas such that it might have been misread as vanity.  It was with\nheart-sickness he perceived that, while her sentiments towards him\nwere those of the frankest friendliness only, he loved her more than\nbefore becoming acquainted with her; and the gloom of the walk home\nlay not in the night overhead, but in the thought of her departure.\n\n\"Why must you leave Christminster?\" he said regretfully.  \"How can\nyou do otherwise than cling to a city in whose history such men as\nNewman, Pusey, Ward, Keble, loom so large!\"\n\n\"Yes--they do.  Though how large do they loom in the history of the\nworld? ...  What a funny reason for caring to stay!  I should never\nhave thought of it!\"  She laughed.\n\n\"Well--I must go,\" she continued.  \"Miss Fontover, one of the\npartners whom I serve, is offended with me, and I with her; and it\nis best to go.\"\n\n\"How did that happen?\"\n\n\"She broke some statuary of mine.\"\n\n\"Oh?  Wilfully?\"\n\n\"Yes.  She found it in my room, and though it was my property she\nthrew it on the floor and stamped on it, because it was not according\nto her taste, and ground the arms and the head of one of the figures\nall to bits with her heel--a horrid thing!\"\n\n\"Too Catholic-Apostolic for her, I suppose?  No doubt she called them\npopish images and talked of the invocation of saints.\"\n\n\"No...  No, she didn't do that.  She saw the matter quite\ndifferently.\"\n\n\"Ah!  Then I am surprised!\"\n\n\"Yes.  It was for quite some other reason that she didn't like my\npatron-saints.  So I was led to retort upon her; and the end of it\nwas that I resolved not to stay, but to get into an occupation in\nwhich I shall be more independent.\"\n\n\"Why don't you try teaching again?  You once did, I heard.\"\n\n\"I never thought of resuming it; for I was getting on as an\nart-designer.\"\n\n\"DO let me ask Mr. Phillotson to let you try your hand in his\nschool?  If you like it, and go to a training college, and become a\nfirst-class certificated mistress, you get twice as large an income\nas any designer or church artist, and twice as much freedom.\"\n\n\"Well--ask him.  Now I must go in.  Good-bye, dear Jude!  I am so\nglad we have met at last.  We needn't quarrel because our parents\ndid, need we?\"\n\nJude did not like to let her see quite how much he agreed with her,\nand went his way to the remote street in which he had his lodging.\n\nTo keep Sue Bridehead near him was now a desire which operated\nwithout regard of consequences, and the next evening he again set out\nfor Lumsdon, fearing to trust to the persuasive effects of a note\nonly.  The school-master was unprepared for such a proposal.\n\n\"What I rather wanted was a second year's transfer, as it is called,\"\nhe said.  \"Of course your cousin would do, personally; but she has\nhad no experience.  Oh--she has, has she?  Does she really think of\nadopting teaching as a profession?\"\n\nJude said she was disposed to do so, he thought, and his ingenious\narguments on her natural fitness for assisting Mr. Phillotson, of\nwhich Jude knew nothing whatever, so influenced the schoolmaster that\nhe said he would engage her, assuring Jude as a friend that unless\nhis cousin really meant to follow on in the same course, and regarded\nthis step as the first stage of an apprenticeship, of which her\ntraining in a normal school would be the second stage, her time would\nbe wasted quite, the salary being merely nominal.\n\nThe day after this visit Phillotson received a letter from Jude,\ncontaining the information that he had again consulted his cousin,\nwho took more and more warmly to the idea of tuition; and that\nshe had agreed to come.  It did not occur for a moment to the\nschoolmaster and recluse that Jude's ardour in promoting the\narrangement arose from any other feelings towards Sue than the\ninstinct of co-operation common among members of the same family.\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nThe schoolmaster sat in his homely dwelling attached to the school,\nboth being modern erections; and he looked across the way at the old\nhouse in which his teacher Sue had a lodging.  The arrangement had\nbeen concluded very quickly.  A pupil-teacher who was to have been\ntransferred to Mr. Phillotson's school had failed him, and Sue had\nbeen taken as stop-gap.  All such provisional arrangements as these\ncould only last till the next annual visit of H.M. Inspector, whose\napproval was necessary to make them permanent.  Having taught for\nsome two years in London, though she had abandoned that vocation of\nlate, Miss Bridehead was not exactly a novice, and Phillotson thought\nthere would be no difficulty in retaining her services, which he\nalready wished to do, though she had only been with him three or four\nweeks.  He had found her quite as bright as Jude had described her;\nand what master-tradesman does not wish to keep an apprentice who\nsaves him half his labour?\n\nIt was a little over half-past eight o'clock in the morning and he\nwas waiting to see her cross the road to the school, when he would\nfollow.  At twenty minutes to nine she did cross, a light hat tossed\non her head; and he watched her as a curiosity.  A new emanation,\nwhich had nothing to do with her skill as a teacher, seemed to\nsurround her this morning.  He went to the school also, and Sue\nremained governing her class at the other end of the room, all day\nunder his eye.  She certainly was an excellent teacher.\n\nIt was part of his duty to give her private lessons in the evening,\nand some article in the Code made it necessary that a respectable,\nelderly woman should be present at these lessons when the teacher and\nthe taught were of different sexes.  Richard Phillotson thought of\nthe absurdity of the regulation in this case, when he was old enough\nto be the girl's father; but he faithfully acted up to it; and sat\ndown with her in a room where Mrs. Hawes, the widow at whose house\nSue lodged, occupied herself with sewing.  The regulation was,\nindeed, not easy to evade, for there was no other sitting-room in the\ndwelling.\n\nSometimes as she figured--it was arithmetic that they were working\nat--she would involuntarily glance up with a little inquiring smile\nat him, as if she assumed that, being the master, he must perceive\nall that was passing in her brain, as right or wrong.  Phillotson was\nnot really thinking of the arithmetic at all, but of her, in a novel\nway which somehow seemed strange to him as preceptor.  Perhaps she\nknew that he was thinking of her thus.\n\nFor a few weeks their work had gone on with a monotony which in\nitself was a delight to him.  Then it happened that the children were\nto be taken to Christminster to see an itinerant exhibition, in the\nshape of a model of Jerusalem, to which schools were admitted at\na penny a head in the interests of education.  They marched along\nthe road two and two, she beside her class with her simple cotton\nsunshade, her little thumb cocked up against its stem; and Phillotson\nbehind in his long dangling coat, handling his walking-stick\ngenteelly, in the musing mood which had come over him since her\narrival.  The afternoon was one of sun and dust, and when they\nentered the exhibition room few people were present but themselves.\nThe model of the ancient city stood in the middle of the apartment,\nand the proprietor, with a fine religious philanthropy written on his\nfeatures, walked round it with a pointer in his hand, showing the\nyoung people the various quarters and places known to them by name\nfrom reading their Bibles; Mount Moriah, the Valley of Jehoshaphat,\nthe City of Zion, the walls and the gates, outside one of which there\nwas a large mound like a tumulus, and on the mound a little white\ncross.  The spot, he said, was Calvary.\n\n\"I think,\" said Sue to the schoolmaster, as she stood with him a\nlittle in the background, \"that this model, elaborate as it is, is a\nvery imaginary production.  How does anybody know that Jerusalem was\nlike this in the time of Christ?  I am sure this man doesn't.\"\n\n\"It is made after the best conjectural maps, based on actual visits\nto the city as it now exists.\"\n\n\"I fancy we have had enough of Jerusalem,\" she said, \"considering we\nare not descended from the Jews.  There was nothing first-rate about\nthe place, or people, after all--as there was about Athens, Rome,\nAlexandria, and other old cities.\"\n\n\"But my dear girl, consider what it is to us!\"\n\nShe was silent, for she was easily repressed; and then perceived\nbehind the group of children clustered round the model a young man\nin a white flannel jacket, his form being bent so low in his intent\ninspection of the Valley of Jehoshaphat that his face was almost\nhidden from view by the Mount of Olives.  \"Look at your cousin Jude,\"\ncontinued the schoolmaster.  \"He doesn't think we have had enough of\nJerusalem!\"\n\n\"Ah--I didn't see him!\" she cried in her quick, light voice.\n\"Jude--how seriously you are going into it!\"\n\nJude started up from his reverie, and saw her.  \"Oh--Sue!\" he said,\nwith a glad flush of embarrassment.  \"These are your school-children,\nof course!  I saw that schools were admitted in the afternoons, and\nthought you might come; but I got so deeply interested that I didn't\nremember where I was.  How it carries one back, doesn't it!  I could\nexamine it for hours, but I have only a few minutes, unfortunately;\nfor I am in the middle of a job out here.\"\n\n\"Your cousin is so terribly clever that she criticizes it\nunmercifully,\" said Phillotson, with good-humoured satire.  \"She is\nquite sceptical as to its correctness.\"\n\n\"No, Mr. Phillotson, I am not--altogether!  I hate to be what is\ncalled a clever girl--there are too many of that sort now!\" answered\nSue sensitively.  \"I only meant--I don't know what I meant--except\nthat it was what you don't understand!\"\n\n\"_I_ know your meaning,\" said Jude ardently (although he did not).\n\"And I think you are quite right.\"\n\n\"That's a good Jude--I know YOU believe in me!\"  She impulsively\nseized his hand, and leaving a reproachful look on the schoolmaster\nturned away to Jude, her voice revealing a tremor which she herself\nfelt to be absurdly uncalled for by sarcasm so gentle.  She had not\nthe least conception how the hearts of the twain went out to her at\nthis momentary revelation of feeling, and what a complication she was\nbuilding up thereby in the futures of both.\n\nThe model wore too much of an educational aspect for the children not\nto tire of it soon, and a little later in the afternoon they were all\nmarched back to Lumsdon, Jude returning to his work.  He watched the\njuvenile flock in their clean frocks and pinafores, filing down the\nstreet towards the country beside Phillotson and Sue, and a sad,\ndissatisfied sense of being out of the scheme of the latters' lives\nhad possession of him.  Phillotson had invited him to walk out\nand see them on Friday evening, when there would be no lessons to\ngive to Sue, and Jude had eagerly promised to avail himself of the\nopportunity.\n\nMeanwhile the scholars and teachers moved homewards, and the next\nday, on looking on the blackboard in Sue's class, Phillotson was\nsurprised to find upon it, skilfully drawn in chalk, a perspective\nview of Jerusalem, with every building shown in its place.\n\n\"I thought you took no interest in the model, and hardly looked at\nit?\" he said.\n\n\"I hardly did,\" said she, \"but I remembered that much of it.\"\n\n\"It is more than I had remembered myself.\"\n\nHer Majesty's school-inspector was at that time paying\n\"surprise-visits\" in this neighbourhood to test the teaching\nunawares; and two days later, in the middle of the morning lessons,\nthe latch of the door was softly lifted, and in walked my gentleman,\nthe king of terrors--to pupil-teachers.\n\nTo Mr. Phillotson the surprise was not great; like the lady in the\nstory, he had been played that trick too many times to be unprepared.\nBut Sue's class was at the further end of the room, and her back was\ntowards the entrance; the inspector therefore came and stood behind\nher and watched her teaching some half-minute before she became aware\nof his presence.  She turned, and realized that an oft-dreaded moment\nhad come.  The effect upon her timidity was such that she uttered a\ncry of fright.  Phillotson, with a strange instinct of solicitude\nquite beyond his control, was at her side just in time to prevent her\nfalling from faintness.  She soon recovered herself, and laughed;\nbut when the inspector had gone there was a reaction, and she was\nso white that Phillotson took her into his room, and gave her some\nbrandy to bring her round.  She found him holding her hand.\n\n\"You ought to have told me,\" she gasped petulantly, \"that one of the\ninspector's surprise-visits was imminent!  Oh, what shall I do!  Now\nhe'll write and tell the managers that I am no good, and I shall be\ndisgraced for ever!\"\n\n\"He won't do that, my dear little girl.  You are the best teacher\never I had!\"\n\nHe looked so gently at her that she was moved, and regretted that she\nhad upbraided him.  When she was better she went home.\n\nJude in the meantime had been waiting impatiently for Friday.  On\nboth Wednesday and Thursday he had been so much under the influence\nof his desire to see her that he walked after dark some distance\nalong the road in the direction of the village, and, on returning to\nhis room to read, found himself quite unable to concentrate his mind\non the page.  On Friday, as soon as he had got himself up as he\nthought Sue would like to see him, and made a hasty tea, he set\nout, notwithstanding that the evening was wet.  The trees overhead\ndeepened the gloom of the hour, and they dripped sadly upon him,\nimpressing him with forebodings--illogical forebodings; for though he\nknew that he loved her he also knew that he could not be more to her\nthan he was.\n\nOn turning the corner and entering the village the first sight that\ngreeted his eyes was that of two figures under one umbrella coming\nout of the vicarage gate.  He was too far back for them to notice\nhim, but he knew in a moment that they were Sue and Phillotson.  The\nlatter was holding the umbrella over her head, and they had evidently\nbeen paying a visit to the vicar--probably on some business connected\nwith the school work.  And as they walked along the wet and deserted\nlane Jude saw Phillotson place his arm round the girl's waist;\nwhereupon she gently removed it; but he replaced it; and she let it\nremain, looking quickly round her with an air of misgiving.  She did\nnot look absolutely behind her, and therefore did not see Jude, who\nsank into the hedge like one struck with a blight.  There he remained\nhidden till they had reached Sue's cottage and she had passed in,\nPhillotson going on to the school hard by.\n\n\"Oh, he's too old for her--too old!\" cried Jude in all the terrible\nsickness of hopeless, handicapped love.\n\nHe could not interfere.  Was he not Arabella's?  He was unable to\ngo on further, and retraced his steps towards Christminster.  Every\ntread of his feet seemed to say to him that he must on no account\nstand in the schoolmaster's way with Sue.  Phillotson was perhaps\ntwenty years her senior, but many a happy marriage had been made\nin such conditions of age.  The ironical clinch to his sorrow was\ngiven by the thought that the intimacy between his cousin and the\nschoolmaster had been brought about entirely by himself.\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nJude's old and embittered aunt lay unwell at Marygreen, and on the\nfollowing Sunday he went to see her--a visit which was the result of\na victorious struggle against his inclination to turn aside to the\nvillage of Lumsdon and obtain a miserable interview with his cousin,\nin which the word nearest his heart could not be spoken, and the\nsight which had tortured him could not be revealed.\n\nHis aunt was now unable to leave her bed, and a great part of Jude's\nshort day was occupied in making arrangements for her comfort.  The\nlittle bakery business had been sold to a neighbour, and with the\nproceeds of this and her savings she was comfortably supplied with\nnecessaries and more, a widow of the same village living with her and\nministering to her wants.  It was not till the time had nearly come\nfor him to leave that he obtained a quiet talk with her, and his\nwords tended insensibly towards his cousin.\n\n\"Was Sue born here?\"\n\n\"She was--in this room.  They were living here at that time.  What\nmade 'ee ask that?\"\n\n\"Oh--I wanted to know.\"\n\n\"Now you've been seeing her!\" said the harsh old woman.  \"And what\ndid I tell 'ee?\"\n\n\"Well--that I was not to see her.\"\n\n\"Have you gossiped with her?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then don't keep it up.  She was brought up by her father to hate her\nmother's family; and she'll look with no favour upon a working chap\nlike you--a townish girl as she's become by now.  I never cared much\nabout her.  A pert little thing, that's what she was too often, with\nher tight-strained nerves.  Many's the time I've smacked her for her\nimpertinence.  Why, one day when she was walking into the pond with\nher shoes and stockings off, and her petticoats pulled above her\nknees, afore I could cry out for shame, she said: 'Move on, Aunty!\nThis is no sight for modest eyes!'\"\n\n\"She was a little child then.\"\n\n\"She was twelve if a day.\"\n\n\"Well--of course.  But now she's older she's of a thoughtful,\nquivering, tender nature, and as sensitive as--\"\n\n\"Jude!\" cried his aunt, springing up in bed.  \"Don't you be a fool\nabout her!\"\n\n\"No, no, of course not.\"\n\n\"Your marrying that woman Arabella was about as bad a thing as a man\ncould possibly do for himself by trying hard.  But she's gone to\nthe other side of the world, and med never trouble you again.  And\nthere'll be a worse thing if you, tied and bound as you be, should\nhave a fancy for Sue.  If your cousin is civil to you, take her\ncivility for what it is worth.  But anything more than a relation's\ngood wishes it is stark madness for 'ee to give her.  If she's\ntownish and wanton it med bring 'ee to ruin.\"\n\n\"Don't say anything against her, Aunt!  Don't, please!\"\n\nA relief was afforded to him by the entry of the companion and nurse\nof his aunt, who must have been listening to the conversation, for\nshe began a commentary on past years, introducing Sue Bridehead as\na character in her recollections.  She described what an odd little\nmaid Sue had been when a pupil at the village school across the green\nopposite, before her father went to London--how, when the vicar\narranged readings and recitations, she appeared on the platform, the\nsmallest of them all, \"in her little white frock, and shoes, and pink\nsash\"; how she recited \"Excelsior,\" \"There was a sound of revelry by\nnight,\" and \"The Raven\"; how during the delivery she would knit her\nlittle brows and glare round tragically, and say to the empty air, as\nif some real creature stood there--\n\n\n   \"Ghastly, grim, and ancient Raven,\n      wandering from the Nightly shore,\n   Tell me what thy lordly name is\n      on the Night's Plutonian shore!\"\n\n\n\"She'd bring up the nasty carrion bird that clear,\" corroborated the\nsick woman reluctantly, \"as she stood there in her little sash and\nthings, that you could see un a'most before your very eyes.  You too,\nJude, had the same trick as a child of seeming to see things in the\nair.\"\n\nThe neighbour told also of Sue's accomplishments in other kinds:\n\n\"She was not exactly a tomboy, you know; but she could do things that\nonly boys do, as a rule.  I've seen her hit in and steer down the\nlong slide on yonder pond, with her little curls blowing, one of\na file of twenty moving along against the sky like shapes painted\non glass, and up the back slide without stopping.  All boys except\nherself; and then they'd cheer her, and then she'd say, 'Don't be\nsaucy, boys,' and suddenly run indoors.  They'd try to coax her out\nagain.  But 'a wouldn't come.\"\n\nThese retrospective visions of Sue only made Jude the more miserable\nthat he was unable to woo her, and he left the cottage of his aunt\nthat day with a heavy heart.  He would fain have glanced into the\nschool to see the room in which Sue's little figure had so glorified\nitself; but he checked his desire and went on.\n\nIt being Sunday evening some villagers who had known him during his\nresidence here were standing in a group in their best clothes.  Jude\nwas startled by a salute from one of them:\n\n\"Ye've got there right enough, then!\"\n\nJude showed that he did not understand.\n\n\"Why, to the seat of l'arning--the 'City of Light' you used to talk\nto us about as a little boy!  Is it all you expected of it?\"\n\n\"Yes; more!\" cried Jude.\n\n\"When I was there once for an hour I didn't see much in it for my\npart; auld crumbling buildings, half church, half almshouse, and not\nmuch going on at that.\"\n\n\"You are wrong, John; there is more going on than meets the eye of a\nman walking through the streets.  It is a unique centre of thought\nand religion--the intellectual and spiritual granary of this country.\nAll that silence and absence of goings-on is the stillness of\ninfinite motion--the sleep of the spinning-top, to borrow the simile\nof a well-known writer.\"\n\n\"Oh, well, it med be all that, or it med not.  As I say, I didn't see\nnothing of it the hour or two I was there; so I went in and had a pot\no' beer, and a penny loaf, and a ha'porth o' cheese, and waited till\nit was time to come along home.  You've j'ined a college by this\ntime, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Ah, no!\" said Jude.  \"I am almost as far off that as ever.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\nJude slapped his pocket.\n\n\"Just what we thought!  Such places be not for such as you--only for\nthem with plenty o' money.\"\n\n\"There you are wrong,\" said Jude, with some bitterness.  \"They are\nfor such ones!\"\n\nStill, the remark was sufficient to withdraw Jude's attention from\nthe imaginative world he had lately inhabited, in which an abstract\nfigure, more or less himself, was steeping his mind in a sublimation\nof the arts and sciences, and making his calling and election sure\nto a seat in the paradise of the learned.  He was set regarding his\nprospects in a cold northern light.  He had lately felt that he\ncould not quite satisfy himself in his Greek--in the Greek of\nthe dramatists particularly.  So fatigued was he sometimes after\nhis day's work that he could not maintain the critical attention\nnecessary for thorough application.  He felt that he wanted a\ncoach--a friend at his elbow to tell him in a moment what sometimes\nwould occupy him a weary month in extracting from unanticipative,\nclumsy books.\n\nIt was decidedly necessary to consider facts a little more closely\nthan he had done of late.  What was the good, after all, of using\nup his spare hours in a vague labour called \"private study\" without\ngiving an outlook on practicabilities?\n\n\"I ought to have thought of this before,\" he said, as he journeyed\nback.  \"It would have been better never to have embarked in the\nscheme at all than to do it without seeing clearly where I am going,\nor what I am aiming at...  This hovering outside the walls of the\ncolleges, as if expecting some arm to be stretched out from them to\nlift me inside, won't do!  I must get special information.\"\n\nThe next week accordingly he sought it.  What at first seemed an\nopportunity occurred one afternoon when he saw an elderly gentleman,\nwho had been pointed out as the head of a particular college, walking\nin the public path of a parklike enclosure near the spot at which\nJude chanced to be sitting.  The gentleman came nearer, and Jude\nlooked anxiously at his face.  It seemed benign, considerate, yet\nrather reserved.  On second thoughts Jude felt that he could not\ngo up and address him; but he was sufficiently influenced by the\nincident to think what a wise thing it would be for him to state his\ndifficulties by letter to some of the best and most judicious of\nthese old masters, and obtain their advice.\n\nDuring the next week or two he accordingly placed himself in such\npositions about the city as would afford him glimpses of several\nof the most distinguished among the provosts, wardens, and other\nheads of houses; and from those he ultimately selected five whose\nphysiognomies seemed to say to him that they were appreciative and\nfar-seeing men.  To these five he addressed letters, briefly stating\nhis difficulties, and asking their opinion on his stranded situation.\n\nWhen the letters were posted Jude mentally began to criticize\nthem; he wished they had not been sent.  \"It is just one of those\nintrusive, vulgar, pushing, applications which are so common in these\ndays,\" he thought.  \"Why couldn't I know better than address utter\nstrangers in such a way?  I may be an impostor, an idle scamp, a man\nwith a bad character, for all that they know to the contrary...\nPerhaps that's what I am!\"\n\nNevertheless, he found himself clinging to the hope of some reply\nas to his one last chance of redemption.  He waited day after day,\nsaying that it was perfectly absurd to expect, yet expecting.\nWhile he waited he was suddenly stirred by news about Phillotson.\nPhillotson was giving up the school near Christminster, for a larger\none further south, in Mid-Wessex.  What this meant; how it would\naffect his cousin; whether, as seemed possible, it was a practical\nmove of the schoolmaster's towards a larger income, in view of a\nprovision for two instead of one, he would not allow himself to say.\nAnd the tender relations between Phillotson and the young girl of\nwhom Jude was passionately enamoured effectually made it repugnant to\nJude's tastes to apply to Phillotson for advice on his own scheme.\n\nMeanwhile the academic dignitaries to whom Jude had written\nvouchsafed no answer, and the young man was thus thrown back\nentirely on himself, as formerly, with the added gloom of a weakened\nhope.  By indirect inquiries he soon perceived clearly what he had\nlong uneasily suspected, that to qualify himself for certain open\nscholarships and exhibitions was the only brilliant course.  But to\ndo this a good deal of coaching would be necessary, and much natural\nability.  It was next to impossible that a man reading on his own\nsystem, however widely and thoroughly, even over the prolonged period\nof ten years, should be able to compete with those who had passed\ntheir lives under trained teachers and had worked to ordained lines.\n\nThe other course, that of buying himself in, so to speak, seemed the\nonly one really open to men like him, the difficulty being simply of\na material kind.  With the help of his information he began to reckon\nthe extent of this material obstacle, and ascertained, to his dismay,\nthat, at the rate at which, with the best of fortune, he would be\nable to save money, fifteen years must elapse before he could be in a\nposition to forward testimonials to the head of a college and advance\nto a matriculation examination.  The undertaking was hopeless.\n\nHe saw what a curious and cunning glamour the neighbourhood of the\nplace had exercised over him.  To get there and live there, to move\namong the churches and halls and become imbued with the _genius\nloci_, had seemed to his dreaming youth, as the spot shaped its\ncharms to him from its halo on the horizon, the obvious and ideal\nthing to do.  \"Let me only get there,\" he had said with the\nfatuousness of Crusoe over his big boat, \"and the rest is but a\nmatter of time and energy.\"  It would have been far better for him in\nevery way if he had never come within sight and sound of the delusive\nprecincts, had gone to some busy commercial town with the sole object\nof making money by his wits, and thence surveyed his plan in true\nperspective.  Well, all that was clear to him amounted to this, that\nthe whole scheme had burst up, like an iridescent soap-bubble, under\nthe touch of a reasoned inquiry.  He looked back at himself along the\nvista of his past years, and his thought was akin to Heine's:\n\n\n   Above the youth's inspired and flashing eyes\n   I see the motley mocking fool's-cap rise!\n\n\nFortunately he had not been allowed to bring his disappointment into\nhis dear Sue's life by involving her in this collapse.  And the\npainful details of his awakening to a sense of his limitations should\nnow be spared her as far as possible.  After all, she had only known\na little part of the miserable struggle in which he had been engaged\nthus unequipped, poor, and unforeseeing.\n\nHe always remembered the appearance of the afternoon on which he\nawoke from his dream.  Not quite knowing what to do with himself, he\nwent up to an octagonal chamber in the lantern of a singularly built\ntheatre that was set amidst this quaint and singular city.  It had\nwindows all round, from which an outlook over the whole town and\nits edifices could be gained.  Jude's eyes swept all the views in\nsuccession, meditatively, mournfully, yet sturdily.  Those buildings\nand their associations and privileges were not for him.  From the\nlooming roof of the great library, into which he hardly ever had time\nto enter, his gaze travelled on to the varied spires, halls, gables,\nstreets, chapels, gardens, quadrangles, which composed the ensemble\nof this unrivalled panorama.  He saw that his destiny lay not with\nthese, but among the manual toilers in the shabby purlieu which he\nhimself occupied, unrecognized as part of the city at all by its\nvisitors and panegyrists, yet without whose denizens the hard readers\ncould not read nor the high thinkers live.\n\nHe looked over the town into the country beyond, to the trees which\nscreened her whose presence had at first been the support of his\nheart, and whose loss was now a maddening torture.  But for this blow\nhe might have borne with his fate.  With Sue as companion he could\nhave renounced his ambitions with a smile.  Without her it was\ninevitable that the reaction from the long strain to which he had\nsubjected himself should affect him disastrously.  Phillotson had\nno doubt passed through a similar intellectual disappointment to\nthat which now enveloped him.  But the schoolmaster had been since\nblest with the consolation of sweet Sue, while for him there was no\nconsoler.\n\nDescending to the streets, he went listlessly along till he arrived\nat an inn, and entered it.  Here he drank several glasses of beer in\nrapid succession, and when he came out it was night.  By the light of\nthe flickering lamps he rambled home to supper, and had not long been\nsitting at table when his landlady brought up a letter that had just\narrived for him.  She laid it down as if impressed with a sense of\nits possible importance, and on looking at it Jude perceived that it\nbore the embossed stamp of one of the colleges whose heads he had\naddressed.  \"ONE--at last!\" cried Jude.\n\nThe communication was brief, and not exactly what he had expected;\nthough it really was from the master in person.  It ran thus:\n\n\n   BIBLIOLL COLLEGE.\n\n   SIR,--I have read your letter with interest; and, judging\n   from your description of yourself as a working-man, I\n   venture to think that you will have a much better chance\n   of success in life by remaining in your own sphere and\n   sticking to your trade than by adopting any other course.\n   That, therefore, is what I advise you to do.  Yours\n   faithfully,\n\n   T. TETUPHENAY.\n\n   To Mr. J. FAWLEY, Stone-mason.\n\n\nThis terribly sensible advice exasperated Jude.  He had known all\nthat before.  He knew it was true.  Yet it seemed a hard slap after\nten years of labour, and its effect upon him just now was to make him\nrise recklessly from the table, and, instead of reading as usual, to\ngo downstairs and into the street.  He stood at a bar and tossed off\ntwo or three glasses, then unconsciously sauntered along till he\ncame to a spot called The Fourways in the middle of the city, gazing\nabstractedly at the groups of people like one in a trance, till,\ncoming to himself, he began talking to the policeman fixed there.\n\nThat officer yawned, stretched out his elbows, elevated himself\nan inch and a half on the balls of his toes, smiled, and looking\nhumorously at Jude, said, \"You've had a wet, young man.\"\n\n\"No; I've only begun,\" he replied cynically.\n\nWhatever his wetness, his brains were dry enough.  He only heard in\npart the policeman's further remarks, having fallen into thought on\nwhat struggling people like himself had stood at that crossway, whom\nnobody ever thought of now.  It had more history than the oldest\ncollege in the city.  It was literally teeming, stratified, with the\nshades of human groups, who had met there for tragedy, comedy, farce;\nreal enactments of the intensest kind.  At Fourways men had stood\nand talked of Napoleon, the loss of America, the execution of King\nCharles, the burning of the Martyrs, the Crusades, the Norman\nConquest, possibly of the arrival of Caesar.  Here the two sexes had\nmet for loving, hating, coupling, parting; had waited, had suffered,\nfor each other; had triumphed over each other; cursed each other in\njealousy, blessed each other in forgiveness.\n\nHe began to see that the town life was a book of humanity infinitely\nmore palpitating, varied, and compendious than the gown life.\nThese struggling men and women before him were the reality of\nChristminster, though they knew little of Christ or Minster.\nThat was one of the humours of things.  The floating population\nof students and teachers, who did know both in a way, were not\nChristminster in a local sense at all.\n\nHe looked at his watch, and, in pursuit of this idea, he went on till\nhe came to a public hall, where a promenade concert was in progress.\nJude entered, and found the room full of shop youths and girls,\nsoldiers, apprentices, boys of eleven smoking cigarettes, and light\nwomen of the more respectable and amateur class.  He had tapped the\nreal Christminster life.  A band was playing, and the crowd walked\nabout and jostled each other, and every now and then a man got upon\na platform and sang a comic song.\n\nThe spirit of Sue seemed to hover round him and prevent his flirting\nand drinking with the frolicsome girls who made advances--wistful\nto gain a little joy.  At ten o'clock he came away, choosing a\ncircuitous route homeward to pass the gates of the college whose head\nhad just sent him the note.\n\nThe gates were shut, and, by an impulse, he took from his pocket the\nlump of chalk which as a workman he usually carried there, and wrote\nalong the wall:\n\n\"_I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you:\nyea, who knoweth not such things as these?_\"--Job xii. 3.\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nThe stroke of scorn relieved his mind, and the next morning he\nlaughed at his self-conceit. But the laugh was not a healthy one.\nHe re-read the letter from the master, and the wisdom in its lines,\nwhich had at first exasperated him, chilled and depressed him now.\nHe saw himself as a fool indeed.\n\nDeprived of the objects of both intellect and emotion, he could not\nproceed to his work.  Whenever he felt reconciled to his fate as a\nstudent, there came to disturb his calm his hopeless relations with\nSue.  That the one affined soul he had ever met was lost to him\nthrough his marriage returned upon him with cruel persistency, till,\nunable to bear it longer, he again rushed for distraction to the\nreal Christminster life.  He now sought it out in an obscure and\nlow-ceiled tavern up a court which was well known to certain worthies\nof the place, and in brighter times would have interested him simply\nby its quaintness.  Here he sat more or less all the day, convinced\nthat he was at bottom a vicious character, of whom it was hopeless to\nexpect anything.\n\nIn the evening the frequenters of the house dropped in one by one,\nJude still retaining his seat in the corner, though his money was all\nspent, and he had not eaten anything the whole day except a biscuit.\nHe surveyed his gathering companions with all the equanimity\nand philosophy of a man who has been drinking long and slowly,\nand made friends with several: to wit, Tinker Taylor, a decayed\nchurch-ironmonger who appeared to have been of a religious turn in\nearlier years, but was somewhat blasphemous now; also a red-nosed\nauctioneer; also two Gothic masons like himself, called Uncle Jim and\nUncle Joe.  There were present, too, some clerks, and a gown- and\nsurplice-maker's assistant; two ladies who sported moral characters\nof various depths of shade, according to their company, nicknamed\n\"Bower o' Bliss\" and \"Freckles\"; some horsey men \"in the know\"\nof betting circles; a travelling actor from the theatre, and two\ndevil-may-care young men who proved to be gownless undergraduates;\nthey had slipped in by stealth to meet a man about bull-pups,\nand stayed to drink and smoke short pipes with the racing gents\naforesaid, looking at their watches every now and then.\n\nThe conversation waxed general.  Christminster society was\ncriticized, the dons, magistrates, and other people in authority\nbeing sincerely pitied for their shortcomings, while opinions on how\nthey ought to conduct themselves and their affairs to be properly\nrespected, were exchanged in a large-minded and disinterested manner.\n\nJude Fawley, with the self-conceit, effrontery, and _aplomb_ of\na strong-brained fellow in liquor, threw in his remarks somewhat\nperemptorily; and his aims having been what they were for so many\nyears, everything the others said turned upon his tongue, by a sort\nof mechanical craze, to the subject of scholarship and study, the\nextent of his own learning being dwelt upon with an insistence that\nwould have appeared pitiable to himself in his sane hours.\n\n\"I don't care a damn,\" he was saying, \"for any provost, warden,\nprincipal, fellow, or cursed master of arts in the university!  What\nI know is that I'd lick 'em on their own ground if they'd give me a\nchance, and show 'em a few things they are not up to yet!\"\n\n\"Hear, hear!\" said the undergraduates from the corner, where they\nwere talking privately about the pups.\n\n\"You always was fond o' books, I've heard,\" said Tinker Taylor, \"and\nI don't doubt what you state.  Now with me 'twas different.  I always\nsaw there was more to be learnt outside a book than in; and I took my\nsteps accordingly, or I shouldn't have been the man I am.\"\n\n\"You aim at the Church, I believe?\" said Uncle Joe.  \"If you are such\na scholar as to pitch yer hopes so high as that, why not give us a\nspecimen of your scholarship?  Canst say the Creed in Latin, man?\nThat was how they once put it to a chap down in my country.\"\n\n\"I should think so!\" said Jude haughtily.\n\n\"Not he!  Like his conceit!\" screamed one of the ladies.\n\n\"Just you shut up, Bower o' Bliss!\" said one of the undergraduates.\n\"Silence!\"  He drank off the spirits in his tumbler, rapped with it\non the counter, and announced, \"The gentleman in the corner is going\nto rehearse the Articles of his Belief, in the Latin tongue, for the\nedification of the company.\"\n\n\"I won't!\" said Jude.\n\n\"Yes--have a try!\" said the surplice-maker.\n\n\"You can't!\" said Uncle Joe.\n\n\"Yes, he can!\" said Tinker Taylor.\n\n\"I'll swear I can!\" said Jude.  \"Well, come now, stand me a small\nScotch cold, and I'll do it straight off.\"\n\n\"That's a fair offer,\" said the undergraduate, throwing down the\nmoney for the whisky.\n\nThe barmaid concocted the mixture with the bearing of a person\ncompelled to live amongst animals of an inferior species, and the\nglass was handed across to Jude, who, having drunk the contents,\nstood up and began rhetorically, without hesitation:\n\n\"_Credo in unum Deum, Patrem omnipotentem, Factorem coeli et terrae,\nvisibilium omnium et invisibilium._\"\n\n\"Good!  Excellent Latin!\" cried one of the undergraduates, who,\nhowever, had not the slightest conception of a single word.\n\nA silence reigned among the rest in the bar, and the maid stood\nstill, Jude's voice echoing sonorously into the inner parlour, where\nthe landlord was dozing, and bringing him out to see what was going\non.  Jude had declaimed steadily ahead, and was continuing:\n\n\"_Crucifixus etiam pro nobis: sub Pontio Pilato passus, et sepultus\nest.  Et resurrexit tertia die, secundum Scripturas._\"\n\n\"That's the Nicene,\" sneered the second undergraduate.  \"And we\nwanted the Apostles'!\"\n\n\"You didn't say so!  And every fool knows, except you, that the\nNicene is the most historic creed!\"\n\n\"Let un go on, let un go on!\" said the auctioneer.\n\nBut Jude's mind seemed to grow confused soon, and he could not get\non.  He put his hand to his forehead, and his face assumed an\nexpression of pain.\n\n\"Give him another glass--then he'll fetch up and get through it,\"\nsaid Tinker Taylor.\n\nSomebody threw down threepence, the glass was handed, Jude stretched\nout his arm for it without looking, and having swallowed the liquor,\nwent on in a moment in a revived voice, raising it as he neared the\nend with the manner of a priest leading a congregation:\n\n\"_Et in Spiritum Sanctum, Dominum et vivificantem, qui ex Patre\nFilioque procedit.  Qui cum Patre et Filio simul adoratur et\nconglorificatur.  Qui locutus est per prophetas.\n\n\"Et unam Catholicam et Apostolicam Ecclesiam.  Confiteor unum\nBaptisma in remissionem peccatorum.  Et exspecto Resurrectionem\nmortuorum.  Et vitam venturi saeculi.  Amen._\"\n\n\"Well done!\" said several, enjoying the last word, as being the first\nand only one they had recognized.\n\nThen Jude seemed to shake the fumes from his brain, as he stared\nround upon them.\n\n\"You pack of fools!\" he cried.  \"Which one of you knows whether I\nhave said it or no?  It might have been the Ratcatcher's Daughter\nin double Dutch for all that your besotted heads can tell!  See what\nI have brought myself to--the crew I have come among!\"\n\nThe landlord, who had already had his license endorsed for harbouring\nqueer characters, feared a riot, and came outside the counter; but\nJude, in his sudden flash of reason, had turned in disgust and left\nthe scene, the door slamming with a dull thud behind him.\n\nHe hastened down the lane and round into the straight broad street,\nwhich he followed till it merged in the highway, and all sound of his\nlate companions had been left behind.  Onward he still went, under\nthe influence of a childlike yearning for the one being in the world\nto whom it seemed possible to fly--an unreasoning desire, whose ill\njudgement was not apparent to him now.  In the course of an hour,\nwhen it was between ten and eleven o'clock, he entered the village of\nLumsdon, and reaching the cottage, saw that a light was burning in\na downstairs room, which he assumed, rightly as it happened, to be\nhers.\n\nJude stepped close to the wall, and tapped with his finger on the\npane, saying impatiently, \"Sue, Sue!\"\n\nShe must have recognized his voice, for the light disappeared from\nthe apartment, and in a second or two the door was unlocked and\nopened, and Sue appeared with a candle in her hand.\n\n\"Is it Jude?  Yes, it is!  My dear, dear cousin, what's the matter?\"\n\n\"Oh, I am--I couldn't help coming, Sue!\" said he, sinking down upon\nthe doorstep.  \"I am so wicked, Sue--my heart is nearly broken,\nand I could not bear my life as it was!  So I have been drinking,\nand blaspheming, or next door to it, and saying holy things in\ndisreputable quarters--repeating in idle bravado words which ought\nnever to be uttered but reverently!  Oh, do anything with me,\nSue--kill me--I don't care!  Only don't hate me and despise me like\nall the rest of the world!\"\n\n\"You are ill, poor dear!  No, I won't despise you; of course I won't!\nCome in and rest, and let me see what I can do for you.  Now lean on\nme, and don't mind.\"  With one hand holding the candle and the other\nsupporting him, she led him indoors, and placed him in the only easy\nchair the meagrely furnished house afforded, stretching his feet upon\nanother, and pulling off his boots.  Jude, now getting towards his\nsober senses, could only say, \"Dear, dear Sue!\" in a voice broken by\ngrief and contrition.\n\nShe asked him if he wanted anything to eat, but he shook his head.\nThen telling him to go to sleep, and that she would come down early\nin the morning and get him some breakfast, she bade him good-night\nand ascended the stairs.\n\nAlmost immediately he fell into a heavy slumber, and did not wake\ntill dawn.  At first he did not know where he was, but by degrees his\nsituation cleared to him, and he beheld it in all the ghastliness\nof a right mind.  She knew the worst of him--the very worst.  How\ncould he face her now?  She would soon be coming down to see about\nbreakfast, as she had said, and there would he be in all his shame\nconfronting her.  He could not bear the thought, and softly drawing\non his boots, and taking his hat from the nail on which she had hung\nit, he slipped noiselessly out of the house.\n\nHis fixed idea was to get away to some obscure spot and hide, and\nperhaps pray; and the only spot which occurred to him was Marygreen.\nHe called at his lodging in Christminster, where he found awaiting\nhim a note of dismissal from his employer; and having packed up he\nturned his back upon the city that had been such a thorn in his\nside, and struck southward into Wessex.  He had no money left in\nhis pocket, his small savings, deposited at one of the banks in\nChristminster, having fortunately been left untouched.  To get to\nMarygreen, therefore, his only course was walking; and the distance\nbeing nearly twenty miles, he had ample time to complete on the way\nthe sobering process begun in him.\n\nAt some hour of the evening he reached Alfredston.  Here he pawned\nhis waistcoat, and having gone out of the town a mile or two, slept\nunder a rick that night.  At dawn he rose, shook off the hayseeds and\nstems from his clothes, and started again, breasting the long white\nroad up the hill to the downs, which had been visible to him a long\nway off, and passing the milestone at the top, whereon he had carved\nhis hopes years ago.\n\nHe reached the ancient hamlet while the people were at breakfast.\nWeary and mud-bespattered, but quite possessed of his ordinary\nclearness of brain, he sat down by the well, thinking as he did so\nwhat a poor Christ he made.  Seeing a trough of water near he bathed\nhis face, and went on to the cottage of his great-aunt, whom he found\nbreakfasting in bed, attended by the woman who lived with her.\n\n\"What--out o' work?\" asked his relative, regarding him through eyes\nsunken deep, under lids heavy as pot-covers, no other cause for his\ntumbled appearance suggesting itself to one whose whole life had been\na struggle with material things.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jude heavily.  \"I think I must have a little rest.\"\n\nRefreshed by some breakfast, he went up to his old room and lay down\nin his shirt-sleeves, after the manner of the artizan.  He fell\nasleep for a short while, and when he awoke it was as if he had\nawakened in hell.  It WAS hell--\"the hell of conscious failure,\" both\nin ambition and in love.  He thought of that previous abyss into\nwhich he had fallen before leaving this part of the country; the\ndeepest deep he had supposed it then; but it was not so deep as this.\nThat had been the breaking in of the outer bulwarks of his hope:\nthis was of his second line.\n\nIf he had been a woman he must have screamed under the nervous\ntension which he was now undergoing.  But that relief being denied to\nhis virility, he clenched his teeth in misery, bringing lines about\nhis mouth like those in the Laoco\u00c3\u00b6n, and corrugations between his\nbrows.\n\nA mournful wind blew through the trees, and sounded in the chimney\nlike the pedal notes of an organ.  Each ivy leaf overgrowing the wall\nof the churchless church-yard hard by, now abandoned, pecked its\nneighbour smartly, and the vane on the new Victorian-Gothic church in\nthe new spot had already begun to creak.  Yet apparently it was not\nalways the outdoor wind that made the deep murmurs; it was a voice.\nHe guessed its origin in a moment or two; the curate was praying with\nhis aunt in the adjoining room.  He remembered her speaking of him.\nPresently the sounds ceased, and a step seemed to cross the landing.\nJude sat up, and shouted \"Hoi!\"\n\nThe step made for his door, which was open, and a man looked in.\nIt was a young clergyman.\n\n\"I think you are Mr. Highridge,\" said Jude.  \"My aunt has mentioned\nyou more than once.  Well, here I am, just come home; a fellow gone\nto the bad; though I had the best intentions in the world at one\ntime.  Now I am melancholy mad, what with drinking and one thing and\nanother.\"\n\nSlowly Jude unfolded to the curate his late plans and movements, by\nan unconscious bias dwelling less upon the intellectual and ambitious\nside of his dream, and more upon the theological, though this had, up\ntill now, been merely a portion of the general plan of advancement.\n\n\"Now I know I have been a fool, and that folly is with me,\" added\nJude in conclusion.  \"And I don't regret the collapse of my\nuniversity hopes one jot.  I wouldn't begin again if I were sure to\nsucceed.  I don't care for social success any more at all.  But I do\nfeel I should like to do some good thing; and I bitterly regret the\nChurch, and the loss of my chance of being her ordained minister.\"\n\nThe curate, who was a new man to this neighbourhood, had grown deeply\ninterested, and at last he said: \"If you feel a real call to the\nministry, and I won't say from your conversation that you do not,\nfor it is that of a thoughtful and educated man, you might enter the\nChurch as a licentiate.  Only you must make up your mind to avoid\nstrong drink.\"\n\n\"I could avoid that easily enough, if I had any kind of hope to\nsupport me!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPart Third\n\n\nAT MELCHESTER\n\n\n\n   \"For there was no other girl, O bridegroom,\n    like her!\"--SAPPHO (H. T. Wharton).\n\n\nI\n\n\nIt was a new idea--the ecclesiastical and altruistic life as distinct\nfrom the intellectual and emulative life.  A man could preach and\ndo good to his fellow-creatures without taking double-firsts in the\nschools of Christminster, or having anything but ordinary knowledge.\nThe old fancy which had led on to the culminating vision of the\nbishopric had not been an ethical or theological enthusiasm at all,\nbut a mundane ambition masquerading in a surplice.  He feared that\nhis whole scheme had degenerated to, even though it might not have\noriginated in, a social unrest which had no foundation in the nobler\ninstincts; which was purely an artificial product of civilization.\nThere were thousands of young men on the same self-seeking track\nat the present moment.  The sensual hind who ate, drank, and lived\ncarelessly with his wife through the days of his vanity was a more\nlikable being than he.\n\nBut to enter the Church in such an unscholarly way that he could not\nin any probability rise to a higher grade through all his career than\nthat of the humble curate wearing his life out in an obscure village\nor city slum--that might have a touch of goodness and greatness in\nit; that might be true religion, and a purgatorial course worthy of\nbeing followed by a remorseful man.\n\nThe favourable light in which this new thought showed itself by\ncontrast with his foregone intentions cheered Jude, as he sat there,\nshabby and lonely; and it may be said to have given, during the next\nfew days, the _coup de gr\u00c3\u00a2ce_ to his intellectual career--a career\nwhich had extended over the greater part of a dozen years.  He did\nnothing, however, for some long stagnant time to advance his new\ndesire, occupying himself with little local jobs in putting up and\nlettering headstones about the neighbouring villages, and submitting\nto be regarded as a social failure, a returned purchase, by the\nhalf-dozen or so of farmers and other country-people who condescended\nto nod to him.\n\nThe human interest of the new intention--and a human interest is\nindispensable to the most spiritual and self-sacrificing--was created\nby a letter from Sue, bearing a fresh postmark.  She evidently\nwrote with anxiety, and told very little about her own doings, more\nthan that she had passed some sort of examination for a Queen's\nScholarship, and was going to enter a training college at Melchester\nto complete herself for the vocation she had chosen, partly by his\ninfluence.  There was a theological college at Melchester; Melchester\nwas a quiet and soothing place, almost entirely ecclesiastical in its\ntone; a spot where worldly learning and intellectual smartness had no\nestablishment; where the altruistic feeling that he did possess would\nperhaps be more highly estimated than a brilliancy which he did not.\n\nAs it would be necessary that he should continue for a time to work\nat his trade while reading up Divinity, which he had neglected at\nChristminster for the ordinary classical grind, what better course\nfor him than to get employment at the further city, and pursue this\nplan of reading?  That his excessive human interest in the new place\nwas entirely of Sue's making, while at the same time Sue was to be\nregarded even less than formerly as proper to create it, had an\nethical contradictoriness to which he was not blind.  But that much\nhe conceded to human frailty, and hoped to learn to love her only as\na friend and kinswoman.\n\nHe considered that he might so mark out his coming years as to begin\nhis ministry at the age of thirty--an age which much attracted him as\nbeing that of his exemplar when he first began to teach in Galilee.\nThis would allow him plenty of time for deliberate study, and for\nacquiring capital by his trade to help his aftercourse of keeping the\nnecessary terms at a theological college.\n\n\n\nChristmas had come and passed, and Sue had gone to the Melchester\nNormal School.  The time was just the worst in the year for Jude to\nget into new employment, and he had written suggesting to her that\nhe should postpone his arrival for a month or so, till the days had\nlengthened.  She had acquiesced so readily that he wished he had not\nproposed it--she evidently did not much care about him, though she\nhad never once reproached him for his strange conduct in coming to\nher that night, and his silent disappearance.  Neither had she ever\nsaid a word about her relations with Mr. Phillotson.\n\nSuddenly, however, quite a passionate letter arrived from Sue.\nShe was quite lonely and miserable, she told him.  She hated the\nplace she was in; it was worse than the ecclesiastical designer's;\nworse than anywhere.  She felt utterly friendless; could he come\nimmediately?--though when he did come she would only be able to\nsee him at limited times, the rules of the establishment she found\nherself in being strict to a degree.  It was Mr. Phillotson who had\nadvised her to come there, and she wished she had never listened to\nhim.\n\nPhillotson's suit was not exactly prospering, evidently; and Jude\nfelt unreasonably glad.  He packed up his things and went to\nMelchester with a lighter heart than he had known for months.\n\nThis being the turning over a new leaf he duly looked about for\na temperance hotel, and found a little establishment of that\ndescription in the street leading from the station.  When he had\nhad something to eat he walked out into the dull winter light over\nthe town bridge, and turned the corner towards the Close.  The\nday was foggy, and standing under the walls of the most graceful\narchitectural pile in England he paused and looked up.  The lofty\nbuilding was visible as far as the roofridge; above, the dwindling\nspire rose more and more remotely, till its apex was quite lost in\nthe mist drifting across it.\n\nThe lamps now began to be lighted, and turning to the west front\nhe walked round.  He took it as a good omen that numerous blocks\nof stone were lying about, which signified that the cathedral was\nundergoing restoration or repair to a considerable extent.  It seemed\nto him, full of the superstitions of his beliefs, that this was an\nexercise of forethought on the part of a ruling Power, that he might\nfind plenty to do in the art he practised while waiting for a call to\nhigher labours.\n\nThen a wave of warmth came over him as he thought how near he now\nstood to the bright-eyed vivacious girl with the broad forehead\nand pile of dark hair above it; the girl with the kindling glance,\ndaringly soft at times--something like that of the girls he had\nseen in engravings from paintings of the Spanish school.  She was\nhere--actually in this Close--in one of the houses confronting this\nvery west fa\u00c3\u00a7ade.\n\nHe went down the broad gravel path towards the building.  It was\nan ancient edifice of the fifteenth century, once a palace, now\na training-school, with mullioned and transomed windows, and a\ncourtyard in front shut in from the road by a wall.  Jude opened the\ngate and went up to the door through which, on inquiring for his\ncousin, he was gingerly admitted to a waiting-room, and in a few\nminutes she came.\n\nThough she had been here such a short while, she was not as he had\nseen her last.  All her bounding manner was gone; her curves of\nmotion had become subdued lines.  The screens and subtleties of\nconvention had likewise disappeared.  Yet neither was she quite the\nwoman who had written the letter that summoned him.  That had plainly\nbeen dashed off in an impulse which second thoughts had somewhat\nregretted; thoughts that were possibly of his recent self-disgrace.\nJude was quite overcome with emotion.\n\n\"You don't--think me a demoralized wretch--for coming to you as I\nwas--and going so shamefully, Sue?\"\n\n\"Oh, I have tried not to!  You said enough to let me know what had\ncaused it.  I hope I shall never have any doubt of your worthiness,\nmy poor Jude!  And I am glad you have come!\"\n\nShe wore a murrey-coloured gown with a little lace collar.  It was\nmade quite plain, and hung about her slight figure with clinging\ngracefulness.  Her hair, which formerly she had worn according to the\ncustom of the day was now twisted up tightly, and she had altogether\nthe air of a woman clipped and pruned by severe discipline,\nan under-brightness shining through from the depths which that\ndiscipline had not yet been able to reach.\n\nShe had come forward prettily, but Jude felt that she had hardly\nexpected him to kiss her, as he was burning to do, under other\ncolours than those of cousinship.  He could not perceive the least\nsign that Sue regarded him as a lover, or ever would do so, now that\nshe knew the worst of him, even if he had the right to behave as one;\nand this helped on his growing resolve to tell her of his matrimonial\nentanglement, which he had put off doing from time to time in sheer\ndread of losing the bliss of her company.\n\nSue came out into the town with him, and they walked and talked with\ntongues centred only on the passing moments.  Jude said he would like\nto buy her a little present of some sort, and then she confessed,\nwith something of shame, that she was dreadfully hungry.  They were\nkept on very short allowances in the college, and a dinner, tea, and\nsupper all in one was the present she most desired in the world.\nJude thereupon took her to an inn and ordered whatever the house\nafforded, which was not much.  The place, however, gave them a\ndelightful opportunity for a _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_, nobody else being in the\nroom, and they talked freely.\n\nShe told him about the school as it was at that date, and the rough\nliving, and the mixed character of her fellow-students, gathered\ntogether from all parts of the diocese, and how she had to get up and\nwork by gas-light in the early morning, with all the bitterness of\na young person to whom restraint was new.  To all this he listened;\nbut it was not what he wanted especially to know--her relations with\nPhillotson.  That was what she did not tell.  When they had sat and\neaten, Jude impulsively placed his hand upon hers; she looked up\nand smiled, and took his quite freely into her own little soft one,\ndividing his fingers and coolly examining them, as if they were the\nfingers of a glove she was purchasing.\n\n\"Your hands are rather rough, Jude, aren't they?\" she said.\n\n\"Yes.  So would yours be if they held a mallet and chisel all day.\"\n\n\"I don't dislike it, you know.  I think it is noble to see a man's\nhands subdued to what he works in...  Well, I'm rather glad I came\nto this training-school, after all.  See how independent I shall be\nafter the two years' training!  I shall pass pretty high, I expect,\nand Mr. Phillotson will use his influence to get me a big school.\"\n\nShe had touched the subject at last.  \"I had a suspicion, a fear,\"\nsaid Jude, \"that he--cared about you rather warmly, and perhaps\nwanted to marry you.\"\n\n\"Now don't be such a silly boy!\"\n\n\"He has said something about it, I expect.\"\n\n\"If he had, what would it matter?  An old man like him!\"\n\n\"Oh, come, Sue; he's not so very old.  And I know what I saw him\ndoing--\"\n\n\"Not kissing me--that I'm certain!\"\n\n\"No. But putting his arm round your waist.\"\n\n\"Ah--I remember.  But I didn't know he was going to.\"\n\n\"You are wriggling out if it, Sue, and it isn't quite kind!\"\n\nHer ever-sensitive lip began to quiver, and her eye to blink, at\nsomething this reproof was deciding her to say.\n\n\"I know you'll be angry if I tell you everything, and that's why I\ndon't want to!\"\n\n\"Very well, then, dear,\" he said soothingly.  \"I have no real right\nto ask you, and I don't wish to know.\"\n\n\"I shall tell you!\" said she, with the perverseness that was\npart of her.  \"This is what I have done: I have promised--I\nhave promised--that I will marry him when I come out of the\ntraining-school two years hence, and have got my certificate; his\nplan being that we shall then take a large double school in a great\ntown--he the boys' and I the girls'--as married school-teachers often\ndo, and make a good income between us.\"\n\n\"Oh, Sue! ...  But of course it is right--you couldn't have done\nbetter!\"\n\nHe glanced at her and their eyes met, the reproach in his own belying\nhis words.  Then he drew his hand quite away from hers, and turned\nhis face in estrangement from her to the window.  Sue regarded him\npassively without moving.\n\n\"I knew you would be angry!\" she said with an air of no emotion\nwhatever.  \"Very well--I am wrong, I suppose!  I ought not to have\nlet you come to see me!  We had better not meet again; and we'll only\ncorrespond at long intervals, on purely business matters!\"\n\nThis was just the one thing he would not be able to bear, as she\nprobably knew, and it brought him round at once.  \"Oh yes, we will,\"\nhe said quickly.  \"Your being engaged can make no difference to me\nwhatever.  I have a perfect right to see you when I want to; and I\nshall!\"\n\n\"Then don't let us talk of it any more.  It is quite spoiling our\nevening together.  What does it matter about what one is going to do\ntwo years hence!\"\n\nShe was something of a riddle to him, and he let the subject drift\naway.  \"Shall we go and sit in the cathedral?\" he asked, when their\nmeal was finished.\n\n\"Cathedral?  Yes.  Though I think I'd rather sit in the railway\nstation,\" she answered, a remnant of vexation still in her voice.\n\"That's the centre of the town life now.  The cathedral has had its\nday!\"\n\n\"How modern you are!\"\n\n\"So would you be if you had lived so much in the Middle Ages as I\nhave done these last few years!  The cathedral was a very good place\nfour or five centuries ago; but it is played out now...  I am not\nmodern, either.  I am more ancient than medi\u00c3\u00a6valism, if you only\nknew.\"\n\nJude looked distressed.\n\n\"There--I won't say any more of that!\" she cried.  \"Only you don't\nknow how bad I am, from your point of view, or you wouldn't think so\nmuch of me, or care whether I was engaged or not.  Now there's just\ntime for us to walk round the Close, then I must go in, or I shall be\nlocked out for the night.\"\n\nHe took her to the gate and they parted.  Jude had a conviction that\nhis unhappy visit to her on that sad night had precipitated this\nmarriage engagement, and it did anything but add to his happiness.\nHer reproach had taken that shape, then, and not the shape of words.\nHowever, next day he set about seeking employment, which it was not\nso easy to get as at Christminster, there being, as a rule, less\nstone-cutting in progress in this quiet city, and hands being mostly\npermanent.  But he edged himself in by degrees.  His first work was\nsome carving at the cemetery on the hill; and ultimately he became\nengaged on the labour he most desired--the cathedral repairs, which\nwere very extensive, the whole interior stonework having been\noverhauled, to be largely replaced by new.  It might be a labour of\nyears to get it all done, and he had confidence enough in his own\nskill with the mallet and chisel to feel that it would be a matter of\nchoice with himself how long he would stay.\n\nThe lodgings he took near the Close Gate would not have disgraced a\ncurate, the rent representing a higher percentage on his wages than\nmechanics of any sort usually care to pay.  His combined bed and\nsitting-room was furnished with framed photographs of the rectories\nand deaneries at which his landlady had lived as trusted servant in\nher time, and the parlour downstairs bore a clock on the mantelpiece\ninscribed to the effect that it was presented to the same\nserious-minded woman by her fellow-servants on the occasion of her\nmarriage.  Jude added to the furniture of his room by unpacking\nphotographs of the ecclesiastical carvings and monuments that he\nhad executed with his own hands; and he was deemed a satisfactory\nacquisition as tenant of the vacant apartment.\n\nHe found an ample supply of theological books in the city book-shops,\nand with these his studies were recommenced in a different spirit and\ndirection from his former course.  As a relaxation from the Fathers,\nand such stock works as Paley and Butler, he read Newman, Pusey, and\nmany other modern lights.  He hired a harmonium, set it up in his\nlodging, and practised chants thereon, single and double.\n\n\n\nII\n\n\n\"To-morrow is our grand day, you know.  Where shall we go?\"\n\n\"I have leave from three till nine.  Wherever we can get to and come\nback from in that time.  Not ruins, Jude--I don't care for them.\"\n\n\"Well--Wardour Castle.  And then we can do Fonthill if we like--all\nin the same afternoon.\"\n\n\"Wardour is Gothic ruins--and I hate Gothic!\"\n\n\"No.  Quite otherwise.  It is a classic building--Corinthian, I\nthink; with a lot of pictures.\"\n\n\"Ah--that will do.  I like the sound of Corinthian.  We'll go.\"\n\nTheir conversation had run thus some few weeks later, and next\nmorning they prepared to start.  Every detail of the outing was\na facet reflecting a sparkle to Jude, and he did not venture to\nmeditate on the life of inconsistency he was leading.  His Sue's\nconduct was one lovely conundrum to him; he could say no more.\n\nThere duly came the charm of calling at the college door for her; her\nemergence in a nunlike simplicity of costume that was rather enforced\nthan desired; the traipsing along to the station, the porters'\n\"B'your leave!,\" the screaming of the trains--everything formed the\nbasis of a beautiful crystallization.  Nobody stared at Sue, because\nshe was so plainly dressed, which comforted Jude in the thought that\nonly himself knew the charms those habiliments subdued.  A matter\nof ten pounds spent in a drapery-shop, which had no connection\nwith her real life or her real self, would have set all Melchester\nstaring.  The guard of the train thought they were lovers, and put\nthem into a compartment all by themselves.\n\n\"That's a good intention wasted!\" said she.\n\nJude did not respond.  He thought the remark unnecessarily cruel,\nand partly untrue.\n\nThey reached the park and castle and wandered through the\npicture-galleries, Jude stopping by preference in front of the\ndevotional pictures by Del Sarto, Guido Reni, Spagnoletto,\nSassoferrato, Carlo Dolci, and others.  Sue paused patiently beside\nhim, and stole critical looks into his face as, regarding the\nVirgins, Holy Families, and Saints, it grew reverent and abstracted.\nWhen she had thoroughly estimated him at this, she would move on and\nwait for him before a Lely or Reynolds.  It was evident that her\ncousin deeply interested her, as one might be interested in a man\npuzzling out his way along a labyrinth from which one had one's self\nescaped.\n\nWhen they came out a long time still remained to them and Jude\nproposed that as soon as they had had something to eat they should\nwalk across the high country to the north of their present position,\nand intercept the train of another railway leading back to\nMelchester, at a station about seven miles off.  Sue, who was\ninclined for any adventure that would intensify the sense of her\nday's freedom, readily agreed; and away they went, leaving the\nadjoining station behind them.\n\nIt was indeed open country, wide and high.  They talked and bounded\non, Jude cutting from a little covert a long walking-stick for Sue\nas tall as herself, with a great crook, which made her look like a\nshepherdess.  About half-way on their journey they crossed a main\nroad running due east and west--the old road from London to Land's\nEnd.  They paused, and looked up and down it for a moment, and\nremarked upon the desolation which had come over this once lively\nthoroughfare, while the wind dipped to earth and scooped straws and\nhay-stems from the ground.\n\nThey crossed the road and passed on, but during the next half-mile\nSue seemed to grow tired, and Jude began to be distressed for her.\nThey had walked a good distance altogether, and if they could not\nreach the other station it would be rather awkward.  For a long\ntime there was no cottage visible on the wide expanse of down and\nturnip-land; but presently they came to a sheepfold, and next to the\nshepherd, pitching hurdles.  He told them that the only house near\nwas his mother's and his, pointing to a little dip ahead from which a\nfaint blue smoke arose, and recommended them to go on and rest there.\n\nThis they did, and entered the house, admitted by an old woman\nwithout a single tooth, to whom they were as civil as strangers can\nbe when their only chance of rest and shelter lies in the favour of\nthe householder.\n\n\"A nice little cottage,\" said Jude.\n\n\"Oh, I don't know about the niceness.  I shall have to thatch it\nsoon, and where the thatch is to come from I can't tell, for straw do\nget that dear, that 'twill soon be cheaper to cover your house wi'\nchainey plates than thatch.\"\n\nThey sat resting, and the shepherd came in.  \"Don't 'ee mind I,\" he\nsaid with a deprecating wave of the hand; \"bide here as long as ye\nwill.  But mid you be thinking o' getting back to Melchester to-night\nby train?  Because you'll never do it in this world, since you don't\nknow the lie of the country.  I don't mind going with ye some o' the\nways, but even then the train mid be gone.\"\n\nThey started up.\n\n\"You can bide here, you know, over the night--can't 'em, Mother?\nThe place is welcome to ye.  'Tis hard lying, rather, but volk may do\nworse.\"  He turned to Jude and asked privately: \"Be you a married\ncouple?\"\n\n\"Hsh--no!\" said Jude.\n\n\"Oh--I meant nothing ba'dy--not I!  Well then, she can go into\nMother's room, and you and I can lie in the outer chimmer after\nthey've gone through.  I can call ye soon enough to catch the first\ntrain back.  You've lost this one now.\"\n\nOn consideration they decided to close with this offer, and drew up\nand shared with the shepherd and his mother the boiled bacon and\ngreens for supper.\n\n\"I rather like this,\" said Sue, while their entertainers were\nclearing away the dishes.  \"Outside all laws except gravitation and\ngermination.\"\n\n\"You only think you like it; you don't: you are quite a product of\ncivilization,\" said Jude, a recollection of her engagement reviving\nhis soreness a little.\n\n\"Indeed I am not, Jude.  I like reading and all that, but I crave to\nget back to the life of my infancy and its freedom.\"\n\n\"Do you remember it so well?  You seem to me to have nothing\nunconventional at all about you.\"\n\n\"Oh, haven't I!  You don't know what's inside me.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"The Ishmaelite.\"\n\n\"An urban miss is what you are.\"\n\nShe looked severe disagreement, and turned away.\n\nThe shepherd aroused them the next morning, as he had said.  It was\nbright and clear, and the four miles to the train were accomplished\npleasantly.  When they had reached Melchester, and walked to the\nClose, and the gables of the old building in which she was again to\nbe immured rose before Sue's eyes, she looked a little scared.  \"I\nexpect I shall catch it!\" she murmured.\n\nThey rang the great bell and waited.\n\n\"Oh, I bought something for you, which I had nearly forgotten,\" she\nsaid quickly, searching her pocket.  \"It is a new little photograph\nof me.  Would you like it?\"\n\n\"WOULD I!\"  He took it gladly, and the porter came.  There seemed to\nbe an ominous glance on his face when he opened the gate.  She passed\nin, looking back at Jude, and waving her hand.\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nThe seventy young women, of ages varying in the main from nineteen to\none-and-twenty, though several were older, who at this date filled\nthe species of nunnery known as the Training-School at Melchester,\nformed a very mixed community, which included the daughters of\nmechanics, curates, surgeons, shopkeepers, farmers, dairy-men,\nsoldiers, sailors, and villagers.  They sat in the large school-room\nof the establishment on the evening previously described, and word\nwas passed round that Sue Bridehead had not come in at closing-time.\n\n\"She went out with her young man,\" said a second-year's student, who\nknew about young men.  \"And Miss Traceley saw her at the station with\nhim.  She'll have it hot when she does come.\"\n\n\"She said he was her cousin,\" observed a youthful new girl.\n\n\"That excuse has been made a little too often in this school to be\neffectual in saving our souls,\" said the head girl of the year,\ndrily.\n\nThe fact was that, only twelve months before, there had occurred\na lamentable seduction of one of the pupils who had made the same\nstatement in order to gain meetings with her lover.  The affair had\ncreated a scandal, and the management had consequently been rough on\ncousins ever since.\n\nAt nine o'clock the names were called, Sue's being pronounced three\ntimes sonorously by Miss Traceley without eliciting an answer.\n\nAt a quarter past nine the seventy stood up to sing the \"Evening\nHymn,\" and then knelt down to prayers.  After prayers they went in to\nsupper, and every girl's thought was, Where is Sue Bridehead?  Some\nof the students, who had seen Jude from the window, felt that they\nwould not mind risking her punishment for the pleasure of being\nkissed by such a kindly-faced young man.  Hardly one among them\nbelieved in the cousinship.\n\nHalf an hour later they all lay in their cubicles, their tender\nfeminine faces upturned to the flaring gas-jets which at intervals\nstretched down the long dormitories, every face bearing the legend\n\"The Weaker\" upon it, as the penalty of the sex wherein they were\nmoulded, which by no possible exertion of their willing hearts and\nabilities could be made strong while the inexorable laws of nature\nremain what they are.  They formed a pretty, suggestive, pathetic\nsight, of whose pathos and beauty they were themselves unconscious,\nand would not discover till, amid the storms and strains of\nafter-years, with their injustice, loneliness, child-bearing, and\nbereavement, their minds would revert to this experience as to\nsomething which had been allowed to slip past them insufficiently\nregarded.\n\nOne of the mistresses came in to turn out the lights, and before\ndoing so gave a final glance at Sue's cot, which remained empty, and\nat her little dressing-table at the foot, which, like all the rest,\nwas ornamented with various girlish trifles, framed photographs being\nnot the least conspicuous among them.  Sue's table had a moderate\nshow, two men in their filigree and velvet frames standing together\nbeside her looking-glass.\n\n\"Who are these men--did she ever say?\" asked the mistress.  \"Strictly\nspeaking, relations' portraits only are allowed on these tables, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"One--the middle-aged man,\" said a student in the next bed--\"is the\nschoolmaster she served under--Mr. Phillotson.\"\n\n\"And the other--this undergraduate in cap and gown--who is he?\"\n\n\"He is a friend, or was.  She has never told his name.\"\n\n\"Was it either of these two who came for her?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You are sure 'twas not the undergraduate?\"\n\n\"Quite.  He was a young man with a black beard.\"\n\nThe lights were promptly extinguished, and till they fell asleep the\ngirls indulged in conjectures about Sue, and wondered what games\nshe had carried on in London and at Christminster before she came\nhere, some of the more restless ones getting out of bed and looking\nfrom the mullioned windows at the vast west front of the cathedral\nopposite, and the spire rising behind it.\n\nWhen they awoke the next morning they glanced into Sue's nook,\nto find it still without a tenant.  After the early lessons by\ngas-light, in half-toilet, and when they had come up to dress for\nbreakfast, the bell of the entrance gate was heard to ring loudly.\nThe mistress of the dormitory went away, and presently came back to\nsay that the principal's orders were that nobody was to speak to\nBridehead without permission.\n\nWhen, accordingly, Sue came into the dormitory to hastily tidy\nherself, looking flushed and tired, she went to her cubicle in\nsilence, none of them coming out to greet her or to make inquiry.\nWhen they had gone downstairs they found that she did not follow them\ninto the dining-hall to breakfast, and they then learnt that she had\nbeen severely reprimanded, and ordered to a solitary room for a week,\nthere to be confined, and take her meals, and do all her reading.\n\nAt this the seventy murmured, the sentence being, they thought, too\nsevere.  A round robin was prepared and sent in to the principal,\nasking for a remission of Sue's punishment.  No notice was taken.\nTowards evening, when the geography mistress began dictating her\nsubject, the girls in the class sat with folded arms.\n\n\"You mean that you are not going to work?\" said the mistress at last.\n\"I may as well tell you that it has been ascertained that the young\nman Bridehead stayed out with was not her cousin, for the very\ngood reason that she has no such relative.  We have written to\nChristminster to ascertain.\"\n\n\"We are willing to take her word,\" said the head girl.\n\n\"This young man was discharged from his work at Christminster for\ndrunkenness and blasphemy in public-houses, and he has come here to\nlive, entirely to be near her.\"\n\nHowever, they remained stolid and motionless, and the mistress left\nthe room to inquire from her superiors what was to be done.\n\nPresently, towards dusk, the pupils, as they sat, heard exclamations\nfrom the first-year's girls in an adjoining classroom, and one rushed\nin to say that Sue Bridehead had got out of the back window of the\nroom in which she had been confined, escaped in the dark across the\nlawn, and disappeared.  How she had managed to get out of the garden\nnobody could tell, as it was bounded by the river at the bottom, and\nthe side door was locked.\n\nThey went and looked at the empty room, the casement between the\nmiddle mullions of which stood open.  The lawn was again searched\nwith a lantern, every bush and shrub being examined, but she was\nnowhere hidden.  Then the porter of the front gate was interrogated,\nand on reflection he said that he remembered hearing a sort of\nsplashing in the stream at the back, but he had taken no notice,\nthinking some ducks had come down the river from above.\n\n\"She must have walked through the river!\" said a mistress.\n\n\"Or drownded herself,\" said the porter.\n\nThe mind of the matron was horrified--not so much at the possible\ndeath of Sue as at the possible half-column detailing that event in\nall the newspapers, which, added to the scandal of the year before,\nwould give the college an unenviable notoriety for many months to\ncome.\n\nMore lanterns were procured, and the river examined; and then, at\nlast, on the opposite shore, which was open to the fields, some\nlittle boot-tracks were discerned in the mud, which left no doubt\nthat the too excitable girl had waded through a depth of water\nreaching nearly to her shoulders--for this was the chief river of the\ncounty, and was mentioned in all the geography books with respect.\nAs Sue had not brought disgrace upon the school by drowning herself,\nthe matron began to speak superciliously of her, and to express\ngladness that she was gone.\n\nOn the self-same evening Jude sat in his lodgings by the Close Gate.\nOften at this hour after dusk he would enter the silent Close, and\nstand opposite the house that contained Sue, and watch the shadows of\nthe girls' heads passing to and fro upon the blinds, and wish he had\nnothing else to do but to sit reading and learning all day what many\nof the thoughtless inmates despised.  But to-night, having finished\ntea and brushed himself up, he was deep in the perusal of the\nTwenty-ninth Volume of Pusey's Library of the Fathers, a set of books\nwhich he had purchased of a second-hand dealer at a price that seemed\nto him to be one of miraculous cheapness for that invaluable work. He\nfancied he heard something rattle lightly against his window; then he\nheard it again.  Certainly somebody had thrown gravel.  He rose and\ngently lifted the sash.\n\n\"Jude!\" (from below).\n\n\"Sue!\"\n\n\"Yes--it is!  Can I come up without being seen?\"\n\n\"Oh yes!\"\n\n\"Then don't come down.  Shut the window.\"\n\nJude waited, knowing that she could enter easily enough, the front\ndoor being opened merely by a knob which anybody could turn, as\nin most old country towns.  He palpitated at the thought that she\nhad fled to him in her trouble as he had fled to her in his. What\ncounterparts they were!  He unlatched the door of his room, heard a\nstealthy rustle on the dark stairs, and in a moment she appeared in\nthe light of his lamp.  He went up to seize her hand, and found she\nwas clammy as a marine deity, and that her clothes clung to her like\nthe robes upon the figures in the Parthenon frieze.\n\n\"I'm so cold!\" she said through her chattering teeth.  \"Can I come by\nyour fire, Jude?\"\n\nShe crossed to his little grate and very little fire, but as the\nwater dripped from her as she moved, the idea of drying herself was\nabsurd.  \"Whatever have you done, darling?\" he asked, with alarm, the\ntender epithet slipping out unawares.\n\n\"Walked through the largest river in the county--that's what I've\ndone!  They locked me up for being out with you; and it seemed so\nunjust that I couldn't bear it, so I got out of the window and\nescaped across the stream!\"  She had begun the explanation in her\nusual slightly independent tones, but before she had finished the\nthin pink lips trembled, and she could hardly refrain from crying.\n\n\"Dear Sue!\" he said.  \"You must take off all your things!  And let me\nsee--you must borrow some from the landlady. I'll ask her.\"\n\n\"No, no!  Don't let her know, for God's sake!  We are so near the\nschool that they'll come after me!\"\n\n\"Then you must put on mine.  You don't mind?\"\n\n\"Oh no.\"\n\n\"My Sunday suit, you know.  It is close here.\"  In fact, everything\nwas close and handy in Jude's single chamber, because there was not\nroom for it to be otherwise.  He opened a drawer, took out his best\ndark suit, and giving the garments a shake, said, \"Now, how long\nshall I give you?\"\n\n\"Ten minutes.\"\n\nJude left the room and went into the street, where he walked up and\ndown.  A clock struck half-past seven, and he returned.  Sitting in\nhis only arm-chair he saw a slim and fragile being masquerading as\nhimself on a Sunday, so pathetic in her defencelessness that his\nheart felt big with the sense of it.  On two other chairs before the\nfire were her wet garments. She blushed as he sat down beside her,\nbut only for a moment.\n\n\"I suppose, Jude, it is odd that you should see me like this and all\nmy things hanging there?  Yet what nonsense!  They are only a woman's\nclothes--sexless cloth and linen...  I wish I didn't feel so ill and\nsick!  Will you dry my clothes now?  Please do, Jude, and I'll get a\nlodging by and by.  It is not late yet.\"\n\n\"No, you shan't, if you are ill.  You must stay here.  Dear, dear\nSue, what can I get for you?\"\n\n\"I don't know!  I can't help shivering.  I wish I could get warm.\"\nJude put on her his great-coat in addition, and then ran out to the\nnearest public-house, whence he returned with a little bottle in his\nhand.  \"Here's six of best brandy,\" he said.  \"Now you drink it,\ndear; all of it.\"\n\n\"I can't out of the bottle, can I?\"  Jude fetched the glass from the\ndressing-table, and administered the spirit in some water.  She\ngasped a little, but gulped it down, and lay back in the armchair.\n\nShe then began to relate circumstantially her experiences since\nthey had parted; but in the middle of her story her voice faltered,\nher head nodded, and she ceased.  She was in a sound sleep.  Jude,\ndying of anxiety lest she should have caught a chill which might\npermanently injure her, was glad to hear the regular breathing.  He\nsoftly went nearer to her, and observed that a warm flush now rosed\nher hitherto blue cheeks, and felt that her hanging hand was no\nlonger cold.  Then he stood with his back to the fire regarding her,\nand saw in her almost a divinity.\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nJude's reverie was interrupted by the creak of footsteps ascending\nthe stairs.\n\nHe whisked Sue's clothing from the chair where it was drying, thrust\nit under the bed, and sat down to his book.  Somebody knocked and\nopened the door immediately.  It was the landlady.\n\n\"Oh, I didn't know whether you was in or not, Mr. Fawley.  I\nwanted to know if you would require supper.  I see you've a young\ngentleman--\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am. But I think I won't come down to-night. Will you bring\nsupper up on a tray, and I'll have a cup of tea as well.\"\n\nIt was Jude's custom to go downstairs to the kitchen, and eat his\nmeals with the family, to save trouble.  His landlady brought up the\nsupper, however, on this occasion, and he took it from her at the\ndoor.\n\nWhen she had descended he set the teapot on the hob, and drew out\nSue's clothes anew; but they were far from dry.  A thick woollen\ngown, he found, held a deal of water.  So he hung them up again, and\nenlarged his fire and mused as the steam from the garments went up\nthe chimney.\n\nSuddenly she said, \"Jude!\"\n\n\"Yes.  All right.  How do you feel now?\"\n\n\"Better.  Quite well.  Why, I fell asleep, didn't I?  What time is\nit?  Not late surely?\"\n\n\"It is past ten.\"\n\n\"Is it really?  What SHALL I do!\" she said, starting up.\n\n\"Stay where you are.\"\n\n\"Yes; that's what I want to do.  But I don't know what they would\nsay!  And what will you do?\"\n\n\"I am going to sit here by the fire all night, and read.  To-morrow\nis Sunday, and I haven't to go out anywhere.  Perhaps you will be\nsaved a severe illness by resting there.  Don't be frightened.  I'm\nall right.  Look here, what I have got for you.  Some supper.\"\n\nWhen she had sat upright she breathed plaintively and said, \"I do\nfeel rather weak still.  I thought I was well; and I ought not to be\nhere, ought I?\"  But the supper fortified her somewhat, and when she\nhad had some tea and had lain back again she was bright and cheerful.\n\nThe tea must have been green, or too long drawn, for she seemed\npreternaturally wakeful afterwards, though Jude, who had not taken\nany, began to feel heavy; till her conversation fixed his attention.\n\n\"You called me a creature of civilization, or something, didn't you?\"\nshe said, breaking a silence.  \"It was very odd you should have done\nthat.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Well, because it is provokingly wrong.  I am a sort of negation of\nit.\"\n\n\"You are very philosophical.  'A negation' is profound talking.\"\n\n\"Is it?  Do I strike you as being learned?\" she asked, with a touch\nof raillery.\n\n\"No--not learned.  Only you don't talk quite like a girl--well, a\ngirl who has had no advantages.\"\n\n\"I have had advantages.  I don't know Latin and Greek, though I know\nthe grammars of those tongues.  But I know most of the Greek and\nLatin classics through translations, and other books too.  I read\nLempri\u00c3\u00a8re, Catullus, Martial, Juvenal, Lucian, Beaumont and Fletcher,\nBoccaccio, Scarron, De Brant\u00c3\u00b4me, Sterne, De Foe, Smollett, Fielding,\nShakespeare, the Bible, and other such; and found that all interest\nin the unwholesome part of those books ended with its mystery.\"\n\n\"You have read more than I,\" he said with a sigh.  \"How came you to\nread some of those queerer ones?\"\n\n\"Well,\" she said thoughtfully, \"it was by accident.  My life has been\nentirely shaped by what people call a peculiarity in me.  I have no\nfear of men, as such, nor of their books. I have mixed with them--one\nor two of them particularly--almost as one of their own sex.  I mean\nI have not felt about them as most women are taught to feel--to be on\ntheir guard against attacks on their virtue; for no average man--no\nman short of a sensual savage--will molest a woman by day or night,\nat home or abroad, unless she invites him.  Until she says by a look\n'Come on' he is always afraid to, and if you never say it, or look\nit, he never comes.  However, what I was going to say is that when I\nwas eighteen I formed a friendly intimacy with an undergraduate at\nChristminster, and he taught me a great deal, and lent me books which\nI should never have got hold of otherwise.\"\n\n\"Is your friendship broken off?\"\n\n\"Oh yes.  He died, poor fellow, two or three years after he had taken\nhis degree and left Christminster.\"\n\n\"You saw a good deal of him, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes.  We used to go about together--on walking tours, reading tours,\nand things of that sort--like two men almost.  He asked me to live\nwith him, and I agreed to by letter.  But when I joined him in London\nI found he meant a different thing from what I meant.  He wanted me\nto be his mistress, in fact, but I wasn't in love with him--and on\nmy saying I should go away if he didn't agree to MY plan, he did\nso.  We shared a sitting-room for fifteen months; and he became a\nleader-writer for one of the great London dailies; till he was taken\nill, and had to go abroad.  He said I was breaking his heart by\nholding out against him so long at such close quarters; he could\nnever have believed it of woman.  I might play that game once too\noften, he said.  He came home merely to die.  His death caused a\nterrible remorse in me for my cruelty--though I hope he died of\nconsumption and not of me entirely.  I went down to Sandbourne\nto his funeral, and was his only mourner.  He left me a little\nmoney--because I broke his heart, I suppose.  That's how men\nare--so much better than women!\"\n\n\"Good heavens!--what did you do then?\"\n\n\"Ah--now you are angry with me!\" she said, a contralto note of\ntragedy coming suddenly into her silvery voice.  \"I wouldn't have\ntold you if I had known!\"\n\n\"No, I am not.  Tell me all.\"\n\n\"Well, I invested his money, poor fellow, in a bubble scheme, and\nlost it.  I lived about London by myself for some time, and then I\nreturned to Christminster, as my father-- who was also in London, and\nhad started as an art metal-worker near Long-Acre--wouldn't have me\nback; and I got that occupation in the artist-shop where you found\nme...  I said you didn't know how bad I was!\"\n\nJude looked round upon the arm-chair and its occupant, as if to read\nmore carefully the creature he had given shelter to.  His voice\ntrembled as he said: \"However you have lived, Sue, I believe you are\nas innocent as you are unconventional!\"\n\n\"I am not particularly innocent, as you see, now that I have\n\n\n                           'twitched the robe\n   From that blank lay-figure your fancy draped,'\"\n\n\nsaid she, with an ostensible sneer, though he could hear that she was\nbrimming with tears.  \"But I have never yielded myself to any lover,\nif that's what you mean!  I have remained as I began.\"\n\n\"I quite believe you.  But some women would not have remained as they\nbegan.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not.  Better women would not.  People say I must be\ncold-natured--sexless--on account of it.  But I won't have it!\nSome of the most passionately erotic poets have been the most\nself-contained in their daily lives.\"\n\n\"Have you told Mr. Phillotson about this university scholar friend?\"\n\n\"Yes--long ago.  I have never made any secret of it to anybody.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\n\"He did not pass any criticism--only said I was everything to him,\nwhatever I did; and things like that.\"\n\nJude felt much depressed; she seemed to get further and further away\nfrom him with her strange ways and curious unconsciousness of gender.\n\n\"Aren't you REALLY vexed with me, dear Jude?\" she suddenly asked, in\na voice of such extraordinary tenderness that it hardly seemed to\ncome from the same woman who had just told her story so lightly.  \"I\nwould rather offend anybody in the world than you, I think!\"\n\n\"I don't know whether I am vexed or not.  I know I care very much\nabout you!\"\n\n\"I care as much for you as for anybody I ever met.\"\n\n\"You don't care MORE!  There, I ought not to say that.  Don't answer\nit!\"\n\nThere was another long silence.  He felt that she was treating\nhim cruelly, though he could not quite say in what way.  Her very\nhelplessness seemed to make her so much stronger than he.\n\n\"I am awfully ignorant on general matters, although I have worked so\nhard,\" he said, to turn the subject.  \"I am absorbed in theology, you\nknow.  And what do you think I should be doing just about now, if you\nweren't here?  I should be saying my evening prayers.  I suppose you\nwouldn't like--\"\n\n\"Oh no, no,\" she answered, \"I would rather not, if you don't mind.\nI should seem so--such a hypocrite.\"\n\n\"I thought you wouldn't join, so I didn't propose it.  You must\nremember that I hope to be a useful minister some day.\"\n\n\"To be ordained, I think you said?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then you haven't given up the idea?--I thought that perhaps you had\nby this time.\"\n\n\"Of course not.  I fondly thought at first that you felt as I do\nabout that, as you were so mixed up in Christminster Anglicanism.\nAnd Mr. Phillotson--\"\n\n\"I have no respect for Christminster whatever, except, in a qualified\ndegree, on its intellectual side,\" said Sue Bridehead earnestly.  \"My\nfriend I spoke of took that out of me.  He was the most irreligious\nman I ever knew, and the most moral.  And intellect at Christminster\nis new wine in old bottles.  The medi\u00c3\u00a6valism of Christminster must\ngo, be sloughed off, or Christminster itself will have to go.  To\nbe sure, at times one couldn't help having a sneaking liking for\nthe traditions of the old faith, as preserved by a section of the\nthinkers there in touching and simple sincerity; but when I was in my\nsaddest, rightest mind I always felt,\n\n\n   'O ghastly glories of saints, dead limbs of gibbeted Gods!'\"...\n\n\n\"Sue, you are not a good friend of mine to talk like that!\"\n\n\"Then I won't, dear Jude!\"  The emotional throat-note had come back,\nand she turned her face away.\n\n\"I still think Christminster has much that is glorious; though I\nwas resentful because I couldn't get there.\"  He spoke gently, and\nresisted his impulse to pique her on to tears.\n\n\"It is an ignorant place, except as to the townspeople, artizans,\ndrunkards, and paupers,\" she said, perverse still at his differing\nfrom her.  \"THEY see life as it is, of course; but few of the people\nin the colleges do.  You prove it in your own person.  You are one\nof the very men Christminster was intended for when the colleges\nwere founded; a man with a passion for learning, but no money, or\nopportunities, or friends.  But you were elbowed off the pavement\nby the millionaires' sons.\"\n\n\"Well, I can do without what it confers.  I care for something\nhigher.\"\n\n\"And I for something broader, truer,\" she insisted.  \"At present\nintellect in Christminster is pushing one way, and religion the\nother; and so they stand stock-still, like two rams butting each\nother.\"\n\n\"What would Mr. Phillotson--\"\n\n\"It is a place full of fetishists and ghost-seers!\"\n\nHe noticed that whenever he tried to speak of the schoolmaster she\nturned the conversation to some generalizations about the offending\nuniversity.  Jude was extremely, morbidly, curious about her life as\nPhillotson's _prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9e_ and betrothed; yet she would not enlighten\nhim.\n\n\"Well, that's just what I am, too,\" he said.  \"I am fearful of life,\nspectre-seeing always.\"\n\n\"But you are good and dear!\" she murmured.\n\nHis heart bumped, and he made no reply.\n\n\"You are in the Tractarian stage just now, are you not?\" she added,\nputting on flippancy to hide real feeling, a common trick with her.\n\"Let me see--when was I there?  In the year eighteen hundred and--\"\n\n\"There's a sarcasm in that which is rather unpleasant to me, Sue.\nNow will you do what I want you to?  At this time I read a chapter,\nand then say prayers, as I told you.  Now will you concentrate your\nattention on any book of these you like, and sit with your back to\nme, and leave me to my custom?  You are sure you won't join me?\"\n\n\"I'll look at you.\"\n\n\"No. Don't tease, Sue!\"\n\n\"Very well--I'll do just as you bid me, and I won't vex you, Jude,\"\nshe replied, in the tone of a child who was going to be good for ever\nafter, turning her back upon him accordingly.  A small Bible other\nthan the one he was using lay near her, and during his retreat she\ntook it up, and turned over the leaves.\n\n\"Jude,\" she said brightly, when he had finished and come back to her;\n\"will you let me make you a NEW New Testament, like the one I made\nfor myself at Christminster?\"\n\n\"Oh yes.  How was that made?\"\n\n\"I altered my old one by cutting up all the Epistles and Gospels into\nseparate _brochures_, and rearranging them in chronological order as\nwritten, beginning the book with Thessalonians, following on with the\nEpistles, and putting the Gospels much further on.  Then I had the\nvolume rebound.  My university friend Mr.--but never mind his name,\npoor boy--said it was an excellent idea.  I know that reading it\nafterwards made it twice as interesting as before, and twice as\nunderstandable.\"\n\n\"H'm!\" said Jude, with a sense of sacrilege.\n\n\"And what a literary enormity this is,\" she said, as she glanced\ninto the pages of Solomon's Song.  \"I mean the synopsis at the head\nof each chapter, explaining away the real nature of that rhapsody.\nYou needn't be alarmed: nobody claims inspiration for the chapter\nheadings.  Indeed, many divines treat them with contempt.  It seems\nthe drollest thing to think of the four-and-twenty elders, or\nbishops, or whatever number they were, sitting with long faces and\nwriting down such stuff.\"\n\nJude looked pained.  \"You are quite Voltairean!\" he murmured.\n\n\"Indeed?  Then I won't say any more, except that people have no\nright to falsify the Bible!  I HATE such hum-bug as could attempt to\nplaster over with ecclesiastical abstractions such ecstatic, natural,\nhuman love as lies in that great and passionate song!\"  Her speech\nhad grown spirited, and almost petulant at his rebuke, and her eyes\nmoist.  \"I WISH I had a friend here to support me; but nobody is ever\non my side!\"\n\n\"But my dear Sue, my very dear Sue, I am not against you!\" he said,\ntaking her hand, and surprised at her introducing personal feeling\ninto mere argument.\n\n\"Yes you are, yes you are!\" she cried, turning away her face that he\nmight not see her brimming eyes.  \"You are on the side of the people\nin the training-school--at least you seem almost to be!  What I\ninsist on is, that to explain such verses as this: 'Whither is thy\nbeloved gone, O thou fairest among women?' by the note: '_The Church\nprofesseth her faith_,' is supremely ridiculous!\"\n\n\"Well then, let it be!  You make such a personal matter of\neverything!  I am--only too inclined just now to apply the words\nprofanely.  You know YOU are fairest among women to me, come to\nthat!\"\n\n\"But you are not to say it now!\"  Sue replied, her voice changing\nto its softest note of severity.  Then their eyes met, and they\nshook hands like cronies in a tavern, and Jude saw the absurdity of\nquarrelling on such a hypothetical subject, and she the silliness of\ncrying about what was written in an old book like the Bible.\n\n\"I won't disturb your convictions--I really won't!\" she went on\nsoothingly, for now he was rather more ruffled than she.  \"But I did\nwant and long to ennoble some man to high aims; and when I saw you,\nand knew you wanted to be my comrade, I--shall I confess it?--thought\nthat man might be you.  But you take so much tradition on trust that\nI don't know what to say.\"\n\n\"Well, dear; I suppose one must take some things on trust.  Life\nisn't long enough to work out everything in Euclid problems before\nyou believe it.  I take Christianity.\"\n\n\"Well, perhaps you might take something worse.\"\n\n\"Indeed I might.  Perhaps I have done so!\"  He thought of Arabella.\n\n\"I won't ask what, because we are going to be VERY nice with each\nother, aren't we, and never, never, vex each other any more?\"  She\nlooked up trustfully, and her voice seemed trying to nestle in his\nbreast.\n\n\"I shall always care for you!\" said Jude.\n\n\"And I for you.  Because you are single-hearted, and forgiving to\nyour faulty and tiresome little Sue!\"\n\nHe looked away, for that epicene tenderness of hers was too\nharrowing.  Was it that which had broken the heart of the poor\nleader-writer; and was he to be the next one? ...  But Sue was so\ndear! ...  If he could only get over the sense of her sex, as she\nseemed to be able to do so easily of his, what a comrade she would\nmake; for their difference of opinion on conjectural subjects only\ndrew them closer together on matters of daily human experience.  She\nwas nearer to him than any other woman he had ever met, and he could\nscarcely believe that time, creed, or absence, would ever divide him\nfrom her.\n\nBut his grief at her incredulities returned.  They sat on till she\nfell asleep again, and he nodded in his chair likewise.  Whenever\nhe aroused himself he turned her things, and made up the fire anew.\nAbout six o'clock he awoke completely, and lighting a candle, found\nthat her clothes were dry.  Her chair being a far more comfortable\none than his she still slept on inside his great-coat, looking warm\nas a new bun and boyish as a Ganymede.  Placing the garments by her\nand touching her on the shoulder he went downstairs, and washed\nhimself by starlight in the yard.\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nWhen he returned she was dressed as usual.\n\n\"Now could I get out without anybody seeing me?\" she asked.  \"The\ntown is not yet astir.\"\n\n\"But you have had no breakfast.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't want any!  I fear I ought not to have run away from that\nschool!  Things seem so different in the cold light of morning, don't\nthey?  What Mr. Phillotson will say I don't know!  It was quite by\nhis wish that I went there.  He is the only man in the world for whom\nI have any respect or fear.  I hope he'll forgive me; but he'll scold\nme dreadfully, I expect!\"\n\n\"I'll go to him and explain--\" began Jude.\n\n\"Oh no, you shan't. I don't care for him!  He may think what he\nlikes--I shall do just as I choose!\"\n\n\"But you just this moment said--\"\n\n\"Well, if I did, I shall do as I like for all him!  I have thought of\nwhat I shall do--go to the sister of one of my fellow-students in the\ntraining-school, who has asked me to visit her.  She has a school\nnear Shaston, about eighteen miles from here--and I shall stay there\ntill this has blown over, and I get back to the training-school\nagain.\"\n\nAt the last moment he persuaded her to let him make her a cup of\ncoffee, in a portable apparatus he kept in his room for use on rising\nto go to his work every day before the household was astir.\n\n\"Now a dew-bit to eat with it,\" he said; \"and off we go.  You can\nhave a regular breakfast when you get there.\"\n\nThey went quietly out of the house, Jude accompanying her to the\nstation.  As they departed along the street a head was thrust out\nof an upper window of his lodging and quickly withdrawn.  Sue still\nseemed sorry for her rashness, and to wish she had not rebelled;\ntelling him at parting that she would let him know as soon as she\ngot re-admitted to the training-school.  They stood rather miserably\ntogether on the platform; and it was apparent that he wanted to say\nmore.\n\n\"I want to tell you something--two things,\" he said hurriedly as the\ntrain came up.  \"One is a warm one, the other a cold one!\"\n\n\"Jude,\" she said.  \"I know one of them.  And you mustn't!\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You mustn't love me.  You are to like me--that's all!\"\n\nJude's face became so full of complicated glooms that hers was\nagitated in sympathy as she bade him adieu through the carriage\nwindow.  And then the train moved on, and waving her pretty hand to\nhim she vanished away.\n\n\n\nMelchester was a dismal place enough for Jude that Sunday of her\ndeparture, and the Close so hateful that he did not go once to the\ncathedral services.  The next morning there came a letter from her,\nwhich, with her usual promptitude, she had written directly she had\nreached her friend's house.  She told him of her safe arrival and\ncomfortable quarters, and then added:--\n\n\n   What I really write about, dear Jude, is something I said\n   to you at parting.  You had been so very good and kind to\n   me that when you were out of sight I felt what a cruel and\n   ungrateful woman I was to say it, and it has reproached me\n   ever since.  IF YOU WANT TO LOVE ME, JUDE, YOU MAY: I don't\n   mind at all; and I'll never say again that you mustn't!\n\n   Now I won't write any more about that.  You do forgive your\n   thoughtless friend for her cruelty? and won't make her\n   miserable by saying you don't?--Ever,\n\n   SUE.\n\n\nIt would be superfluous to say what his answer was; and how he\nthought what he would have done had he been free, which should have\nrendered a long residence with a female friend quite unnecessary for\nSue.  He felt he might have been pretty sure of his own victory if\nit had come to a conflict between Phillotson and himself for the\npossession of her.\n\nYet Jude was in danger of attaching more meaning to Sue's impulsive\nnote than it really was intended to bear.\n\nAfter the lapse of a few days he found himself hoping that she would\nwrite again.  But he received no further communication; and in the\nintensity of his solicitude he sent another note, suggesting that he\nshould pay her a visit some Sunday, the distance being under eighteen\nmiles.\n\nHe expected a reply on the second morning after despatching his\nmissive; but none came.  The third morning arrived; the postman did\nnot stop.  This was Saturday, and in a feverish state of anxiety\nabout her he sent off three brief lines stating that he was coming\nthe following day, for he felt sure something had happened.\n\nHis first and natural thought had been that she was ill from her\nimmersion; but it soon occurred to him that somebody would have\nwritten for her in such a case.  Conjectures were put an end to by\nhis arrival at the village school-house near Shaston on the bright\nmorning of Sunday, between eleven and twelve o'clock, when the parish\nwas as vacant as a desert, most of the inhabitants having gathered\ninside the church, whence their voices could occasionally be heard in\nunison.\n\nA little girl opened the door.  \"Miss Bridehead is up-stairs,\" she\nsaid.  \"And will you please walk up to her?\"\n\n\"Is she ill?\" asked Jude hastily.\n\n\"Only a little--not very.\"\n\nJude entered and ascended.  On reaching the landing a voice told him\nwhich way to turn--the voice of Sue calling his name.  He passed the\ndoorway, and found her lying in a little bed in a room a dozen feet\nsquare.\n\n\"Oh, Sue!\" he cried, sitting down beside her and taking her hand.\n\"How is this!  You couldn't write?\"\n\n\"No--it wasn't that!\" she answered.  \"I did catch a bad cold--but I\ncould have written.  Only I wouldn't!\"\n\n\"Why not?--frightening me like this!\"\n\n\"Yes--that was what I was afraid of!  But I had decided not to write\nto you any more.  They won't have me back at the school--that's why I\ncouldn't write.  Not the fact, but the reason!\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"They not only won't have me, but they gave me a parting piece of\nadvice--\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nShe did not answer directly.  \"I vowed I never would tell you,\nJude--it is so vulgar and distressing!\"\n\n\"Is it about us?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"But do tell me!\"\n\n\"Well--somebody has sent them baseless reports about us, and they\nsay you and I ought to marry as soon as possible, for the sake of my\nreputation! ...  There--now I have told you, and I wish I hadn't!\"\n\n\"Oh, poor Sue!\"\n\n\"I don't think of you like that means!  It did just OCCUR to me to\nregard you in the way they think I do, but I hadn't begun to.  I HAVE\nrecognized that the cousinship was merely nominal, since we met as\ntotal strangers.  But my marrying you, dear Jude--why, of course,\nif I had reckoned upon marrying you I shouldn't have come to you so\noften!  And I never supposed you thought of such a thing as marrying\nme till the other evening; when I began to fancy you did love me a\nlittle.  Perhaps I ought not to have been so intimate with you.  It\nis all my fault.  Everything is my fault always!\"\n\nThe speech seemed a little forced and unreal, and they regarded each\nother with a mutual distress.\n\n\"I was so blind at first!\" she went on.  \"I didn't see what you felt\nat all.  Oh, you have been unkind to me--you have--to look upon me\nas a sweetheart without saying a word, and leaving me to discover it\nmyself!  Your attitude to me has become known; and naturally they\nthink we've been doing wrong!  I'll never trust you again!\"\n\n\"Yes, Sue,\" he said simply; \"I am to blame--more than you think.  I\nwas quite aware that you did not suspect till within the last meeting\nor two what I was feeling about you.  I admit that our meeting as\nstrangers prevented a sense of relationship, and that it was a sort\nof subterfuge to avail myself of it.  But don't you think I deserve a\nlittle consideration for concealing my wrong, very wrong, sentiments,\nsince I couldn't help having them?\"\n\nShe turned her eyes doubtfully towards him, and then looked away as\nif afraid she might forgive him.\n\nBy every law of nature and sex a kiss was the only rejoinder that\nfitted the mood and the moment, under the suasion of which Sue's\nundemonstrative regard of him might not inconceivably have changed\nits temperature.  Some men would have cast scruples to the winds,\nand ventured it, oblivious both of Sue's declaration of her neutral\nfeelings, and of the pair of autographs in the vestry chest of\nArabella's parish church.  Jude did not.  He had, in fact, come in\npart to tell his own fatal story.  It was upon his lips; yet at the\nhour of this distress he could not disclose it.  He preferred to\ndwell upon the recognized barriers between them.\n\n\"Of course--I know you don't--care about me in any particular way,\"\nhe sorrowed.  \"You ought not, and you are right.  You belong to--Mr.\nPhillotson.  I suppose he has been to see you?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said shortly, her face changing a little.  \"Though I\ndidn't ask him to come.  You are glad, of course, that he has been!\nBut I shouldn't care if he didn't come any more!\"\n\nIt was very perplexing to her lover that she should be piqued at his\nhonest acquiescence in his rival, if Jude's feelings of love were\ndeprecated by her.  He went on to something else.\n\n\"This will blow over, dear Sue,\" he said.  \"The training-school\nauthorities are not all the world.  You can get to be a student in\nsome other, no doubt.\"\n\n\"I'll ask Mr. Phillotson,\" she said decisively.\n\nSue's kind hostess now returned from church, and there was no more\nintimate conversation.  Jude left in the afternoon, hopelessly\nunhappy.  But he had seen her, and sat with her.  Such intercourse\nas that would have to content him for the remainder of his life.\nThe lesson of renunciation it was necessary and proper that he, as\na parish priest, should learn.\n\nBut the next morning when he awoke he felt rather vexed with her,\nand decided that she was rather unreasonable, not to say capricious.\nThen, in illustration of what he had begun to discern as one of her\nredeeming characteristics there came promptly a note, which she must\nhave written almost immediately he had gone from her:\n\n\n   Forgive me for my petulance yesterday!  I was horrid to\n   you; I know it, and I feel perfectly miserable at my\n   horridness.  It was so dear of you not to be angry!  Jude,\n   please still keep me as your friend and associate, with\n   all my faults.  I'll try not to be like it again.\n\n   I am coming to Melchester on Saturday, to get my things\n   away from the T. S., &c.  I could walk with you for half\n   an hour, if you would like?--Your repentant\n\n   SUE.\n\n\nJude forgave her straightway, and asked her to call for him at the\ncathedral works when she came.\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nMeanwhile a middle-aged man was dreaming a dream of great beauty\nconcerning the writer of the above letter.  He was Richard\nPhillotson, who had recently removed from the mixed village school at\nLumsdon near Christminster, to undertake a large boys' school in his\nnative town of Shaston, which stood on a hill sixty miles to the\nsouth-west as the crow flies.\n\nA glance at the place and its accessories was almost enough to reveal\nthat the schoolmaster's plans and dreams so long indulged in had\nbeen abandoned for some new dream with which neither the Church nor\nliterature had much in common.  Essentially an unpractical man, he\nwas now bent on making and saving money for a practical purpose--that\nof keeping a wife, who, if she chose, might conduct one of the girls'\nschools adjoining his own; for which purpose he had advised her to go\ninto training, since she would not marry him offhand.\n\nAbout the time that Jude was removing from Marygreen to Melchester,\nand entering on adventures at the latter place with Sue, the\nschoolmaster was settling down in the new school-house at Shaston.\nAll the furniture being fixed, the books shelved, and the nails\ndriven, he had begun to sit in his parlour during the dark winter\nnights and re-attempt some of his old studies--one branch of\nwhich had included Roman-Britannic antiquities--an unremunerative\nlabour for a national school-master but a subject, that, after his\nabandonment of the university scheme, had interested him as being a\ncomparatively unworked mine; practicable to those who, like himself,\nhad lived in lonely spots where these remains were abundant, and were\nseen to compel inferences in startling contrast to accepted views on\nthe civilization of that time.\n\nA resumption of this investigation was the outward and apparent hobby\nof Phillotson at present--his ostensible reason for going alone into\nfields where causeways, dykes, and tumuli abounded, or shutting\nhimself up in his house with a few urns, tiles, and mosaics he had\ncollected, instead of calling round upon his new neighbours, who for\ntheir part had showed themselves willing enough to be friendly with\nhim.  But it was not the real, or the whole, reason, after all.\nThus on a particular evening in the month, when it had grown quite\nlate--to near midnight, indeed--and the light of his lamp, shining\nfrom his window at a salient angle of the hill-top town over infinite\nmiles of valley westward, announced as by words a place and person\ngiven over to study, he was not exactly studying.\n\nThe interior of the room--the books, the furniture, the\nschoolmaster's loose coat, his attitude at the table, even the\nflickering of the fire, bespoke the same dignified tale of\nundistracted research--more than creditable to a man who had had no\nadvantages beyond those of his own making.  And yet the tale, true\nenough till latterly, was not true now.  What he was regarding was\nnot history.  They were historic notes, written in a bold womanly\nhand at his dictation some months before, and it was the clerical\nrendering of word after word that absorbed him.\n\nHe presently took from a drawer a carefully tied bundle of letters,\nfew, very few, as correspondence counts nowadays.  Each was in its\nenvelope just as it had arrived, and the handwriting was of the same\nwomanly character as the historic notes.  He unfolded them one by\none and read them musingly. At first sight there seemed in these\nsmall documents to be absolutely nothing to muse over.  They were\nstraightforward, frank letters, signed \"Sue B--\"; just such ones as\nwould be written during short absences, with no other thought than\ntheir speedy destruction, and chiefly concerning books in reading\nand other experiences of a training school, forgotten doubtless by\nthe writer with the passing of the day of their inditing.  In one of\nthem--quite a recent note--the young woman said that she had received\nhis considerate letter, and that it was honourable and generous of\nhim to say he would not come to see her oftener than she desired (the\nschool being such an awkward place for callers, and because of her\nstrong wish that her engagement to him should not be known, which it\nwould infallibly be if he visited her often). Over these phrases the\nschool-master pored.  What precise shade of satisfaction was to be\ngathered from a woman's gratitude that the man who loved her had not\nbeen often to see her?  The problem occupied him, distracted him.\n\nHe opened another drawer, and found therein an envelope, from which\nhe drew a photograph of Sue as a child, long before he had known her,\nstanding under trellis-work with a little basket in her hand.  There\nwas another of her as a young woman, her dark eyes and hair making a\nvery distinct and attractive picture of her, which just disclosed,\ntoo, the thoughtfulness that lay behind her lighter moods.  It was\na duplicate of the one she had given Jude, and would have given to\nany man.  Phillotson brought it half-way to his lips, but withdrew\nit in doubt at her perplexing phrases: ultimately kissing the\ndead pasteboard with all the passionateness, and more than all the\ndevotion, of a young man of eighteen.\n\nThe schoolmaster's was an unhealthy-looking, old-fashioned face,\nrendered more old-fashioned by his style of shaving.  A certain\ngentlemanliness had been imparted to it by nature, suggesting an\ninherent wish to do rightly by all.  His speech was a little slow,\nbut his tones were sincere enough to make his hesitation no defect.\nHis greying hair was curly, and radiated from a point in the middle\nof his crown.  There were four lines across his forehead, and he only\nwore spectacles when reading at night.  It was almost certainly a\nrenunciation forced upon him by his academic purpose, rather than a\ndistaste for women, which had hitherto kept him from closing with one\nof the sex in matrimony.\n\nSuch silent proceedings as those of this evening were repeated many\nand oft times when he was not under the eye of the boys, whose quick\nand penetrating regard would frequently become almost intolerable to\nthe self-conscious master in his present anxious care for Sue, making\nhim, in the grey hours of morning, dread to meet anew the gimlet\nglances, lest they should read what the dream within him was.\n\nHe had honourably acquiesced in Sue's announced wish that he was\nnot often to visit her at the training school; but at length, his\npatience being sorely tried, he set out one Saturday afternoon to pay\nher an unexpected call.  There the news of her departure--expulsion\nas it might almost have been considered--was flashed upon him without\nwarning or mitigation as he stood at the door expecting in a few\nminutes to behold her face; and when he turned away he could hardly\nsee the road before him.\n\nSue had, in fact, never written a line to her suitor on the subject,\nalthough it was fourteen days old.  A short reflection told him that\nthis proved nothing, a natural delicacy being as ample a reason for\nsilence as any degree of blameworthiness.\n\nThey had informed him at the school where she was living, and having\nno immediate anxiety about her comfort, his thoughts took the\ndirection of a burning indignation against the training school\ncommittee.  In his bewilderment Phillotson entered the adjacent\ncathedral, just now in a direly dismantled state by reason of\nthe repairs.  He sat down on a block of freestone, regardless of\nthe dusty imprint it made on his breeches; and his listless eyes\nfollowing the movements of the workmen he presently became aware\nthat the reputed culprit, Sue's lover Jude, was one amongst them.\n\nJude had never spoken to his former hero since the meeting by the\nmodel of Jerusalem.  Having inadvertently witnessed Phillotson's\ntentative courtship of Sue in the lane there had grown up in the\nyounger man's mind a curious dislike to think of the elder, to meet\nhim, to communicate in any way with him; and since Phillotson's\nsuccess in obtaining at least her promise had become known to Jude,\nhe had frankly recognized that he did not wish to see or hear of his\nsenior any more, learn anything of his pursuits, or even imagine\nagain what excellencies might appertain to his character.  On this\nvery day of the schoolmaster's visit Jude was expecting Sue, as she\nhad promised; and when therefore he saw the schoolmaster in the nave\nof the building, saw, moreover, that he was coming to speak to him,\nhe felt no little embarrassment; which Phillotson's own embarrassment\nprevented his observing.\n\nJude joined him, and they both withdrew from the other workmen to the\nspot where Phillotson had been sitting.  Jude offered him a piece of\nsackcloth for a cushion, and told him it was dangerous to sit on the\nbare block.\n\n\"Yes; yes,\" said Phillotson abstractedly, as he reseated himself, his\neyes resting on the ground as if he were trying to remember where he\nwas.  \"I won't keep you long.  It was merely that I have heard that\nyou have seen my little friend Sue recently.  It occurred to me to\nspeak to you on that account.  I merely want to ask--about her.\"\n\n\"I think I know what!\"  Jude hurriedly said.  \"About her escaping\nfrom the training school, and her coming to me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well\"--Jude for a moment felt an unprincipled and fiendish wish to\nannihilate his rival at all cost.  By the exercise of that treachery\nwhich love for the same woman renders possible to men the most\nhonourable in every other relation of life, he could send off\nPhillotson in agony and defeat by saying that the scandal was true,\nand that Sue had irretrievably committed herself with him.  But his\naction did not respond for a moment to his animal instinct; and what\nhe said was, \"I am glad of your kindness in coming to talk plainly to\nme about it.  You know what they say?--that I ought to marry her.\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\n\"And I wish with all my soul I could!\"\n\nPhillotson trembled, and his naturally pale face acquired a\ncorpselike sharpness in its lines.  \"I had no idea that it was of\nthis nature!  God forbid!\"\n\n\"No, no!\" said Jude aghast.  \"I thought you understood?  I mean that\nwere I in a position to marry her, or someone, and settle down,\ninstead of living in lodgings here and there, I should be glad!\"\n\nWhat he had really meant was simply that he loved her.\n\n\"But--since this painful matter has been opened up--what really\nhappened?\" asked Phillotson, with the firmness of a man who felt that\na sharp smart now was better than a long agony of suspense hereafter.\n\"Cases arise, and this is one, when even ungenerous questions must be\nput to make false assumptions impossible, and to kill scandal.\"\n\nJude explained readily; giving the whole series of adventures,\nincluding the night at the shepherd's, her wet arrival at his\nlodging, her indisposition from her immersion, their vigil of\ndiscussion, and his seeing her off next morning.\n\n\"Well now,\" said Phillotson at the conclusion, \"I take it as your\nfinal word, and I know I can believe you, that the suspicion which\nled to her rustication is an absolutely baseless one?\"\n\n\"It is,\" said Jude solemnly.  \"Absolutely.  So help me God!\"\n\nThe schoolmaster rose.  Each of the twain felt that the interview\ncould not comfortably merge in a friendly discussion of their recent\nexperiences, after the manner of friends; and when Jude had taken him\nround, and shown him some features of the renovation which the old\ncathedral was undergoing, Phillotson bade the young man good-day and\nwent away.\n\nThis visit took place about eleven o'clock in the morning; but no Sue\nappeared.  When Jude went to his dinner at one he saw his beloved\nahead of him in the street leading up from the North Gate, walking\nas if no way looking for him.  Speedily overtaking her he remarked\nthat he had asked her to come to him at the cathedral, and she had\npromised.\n\n\"I have been to get my things from the college,\" she said--an\nobservation which he was expected to take as an answer, though it was\nnot one.  Finding her to be in this evasive mood he felt inclined to\ngive her the information so long withheld.\n\n\"You have not seen Mr. Phillotson to-day?\" he ventured to inquire.\n\n\"I have not.  But I am not going to be cross-examined about him; and\nif you ask anything more I won't answer!\"\n\n\"It is very odd that--\" He stopped, regarding her.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"That you are often not so nice in your real presence as you are in\nyour letters!\"\n\n\"Does it really seem so to you?\" said she, smiling with quick\ncuriosity.  \"Well, that's strange; but I feel just the same about\nyou, Jude.  When you are gone away I seem such a coldhearted--\"\n\nAs she knew his sentiment towards her Jude saw that they were getting\nupon dangerous ground.  It was now, he thought, that he must speak as\nan honest man.\n\nBut he did not speak, and she continued: \"It was that which made me\nwrite and say--I didn't mind your loving me--if you wanted to, much!\"\n\nThe exultation he might have felt at what that implied, or seemed to\nimply, was nullified by his intention, and he rested rigid till he\nbegan: \"I have never told you--\"\n\n\"Yes you have,\" murmured she.\n\n\"I mean, I have never told you my history--all of it.\"\n\n\"But I guess it.  I know nearly.\"\n\nJude looked up.  Could she possibly know of that morning performance\nof his with Arabella; which in a few months had ceased to be a\nmarriage more completely than by death?  He saw that she did not.\n\n\"I can't quite tell you here in the street,\" he went on with a gloomy\ntongue.  \"And you had better not come to my lodgings.  Let us go in\nhere.\"\n\nThe building by which they stood was the market-house; it was the\nonly place available; and they entered, the market being over, and\nthe stalls and areas empty.  He would have preferred a more congenial\nspot, but, as usually happens, in place of a romantic field or solemn\naisle for his tale, it was told while they walked up and down over a\nfloor littered with rotten cabbage-leaves, and amid all the usual\nsqualors of decayed vegetable matter and unsaleable refuse.  He\nbegan and finished his brief narrative, which merely led up to the\ninformation that he had married a wife some years earlier, and that\nhis wife was living still.  Almost before her countenance had time to\nchange she hurried out the words,\n\n\"Why didn't you tell me before!\"\n\n\"I couldn't. It seemed so cruel to tell it.\"\n\n\"To yourself, Jude.  So it was better to be cruel to me!\"\n\n\"No, dear darling!\" cried Jude passionately.  He tried to take her\nhand, but she withdrew it.  Their old relations of confidence seemed\nsuddenly to have ended, and the antagonisms of sex to sex were left\nwithout any counter-poising predilections.  She was his comrade,\nfriend, unconscious sweetheart no longer; and her eyes regarded him\nin estranged silence.\n\n\"I was ashamed of the episode in my life which brought about the\nmarriage,\" he continued.  \"I can't explain it precisely now.  I could\nhave done it if you had taken it differently!\"\n\n\"But how can I?\" she burst out.  \"Here I have been saying, or\nwriting, that--that you might love me, or something of the\nsort!--just out of charity--and all the time--oh, it is perfectly\ndamnable how things are!\" she said, stamping her foot in a nervous\nquiver.\n\n\"You take me wrong, Sue!  I never thought you cared for me at all,\ntill quite lately; so I felt it did not matter!  Do you care for me,\nSue?--you know how I mean?--I don't like 'out of charity' at all!\"\n\nIt was a question which in the circumstances Sue did not choose to\nanswer.\n\n\"I suppose she--your wife--is--a very pretty woman, even if she's\nwicked?\" she asked quickly.\n\n\"She's pretty enough, as far as that goes.\"\n\n\"Prettier than I am, no doubt!\"\n\n\"You are not the least alike.  And I have never seen her for\nyears...  But she's sure to come back--they always do!\"\n\n\"How strange of you to stay apart from her like this!\" said Sue,\nher trembling lip and lumpy throat belying her irony.  \"You, such a\nreligious man.  How will the demi-gods in your Pantheon--I mean those\nlegendary persons you call saints--intercede for you after this?\nNow if I had done such a thing it would have been different, and not\nremarkable, for I at least don't regard marriage as a sacrament.\nYour theories are not so advanced as your practice!\"\n\n\"Sue, you are terribly cutting when you like to be--a perfect\nVoltaire!  But you must treat me as you will!\"\n\nWhen she saw how wretched he was she softened, and trying to blink\naway her sympathetic tears said with all the winning reproachfulness\nof a heart-hurt woman: \"Ah--you should have told me before you gave\nme that idea that you wanted to be allowed to love me!  I had no\nfeeling before that moment at the railway-station, except--\"  For\nonce Sue was as miserable as he, in her attempts to keep herself free\nfrom emotion, and her less than half-success.\n\n\"Don't cry, dear!\" he implored.\n\n\"I am--not crying--because I meant to--love you; but because of your\nwant of--confidence!\"\n\nThey were quite screened from the market-square without, and he could\nnot help putting out his arm towards her waist.  His momentary desire\nwas the means of her rallying.  \"No, no!\" she said, drawing back\nstringently, and wiping her eyes.  \"Of course not!  It would be\nhypocrisy to pretend that it would be meant as from my cousin; and it\ncan't be in any other way.\"\n\nThey moved on a dozen paces, and she showed herself recovered.  It\nwas distracting to Jude, and his heart would have ached less had she\nappeared anyhow but as she did appear; essentially large-minded and\ngenerous on reflection, despite a previous exercise of those narrow\nwomanly humours on impulse that were necessary to give her sex.\n\n\"I don't blame you for what you couldn't help,\" she said, smiling.\n\"How should I be so foolish?  I do blame you a little bit for not\ntelling me before.  But, after all, it doesn't matter.  We should\nhave had to keep apart, you see, even if this had not been in your\nlife.\"\n\n\"No, we shouldn't, Sue!  This is the only obstacle.\"\n\n\"You forget that I must have loved you, and wanted to be your\nwife, even if there had been no obstacle,\" said Sue, with a gentle\nseriousness which did not reveal her mind.  \"And then we are cousins,\nand it is bad for cousins to marry.  And--I am engaged to somebody\nelse.  As to our going on together as we were going, in a sort of\nfriendly way, the people round us would have made it unable to\ncontinue.  Their views of the relations of man and woman are limited,\nas is proved by their expelling me from the school.  Their philosophy\nonly recognizes relations based on animal desire.  The wide field\nof strong attachment where desire plays, at least, only a secondary\npart, is ignored by them--the part of--who is it?--Venus Urania.\"\n\nHer being able to talk learnedly showed that she was mistress of\nherself again; and before they parted she had almost regained her\nvivacious glance, her reciprocity of tone, her gay manner, and her\nsecond-thought attitude of critical largeness towards others of her\nage and sex.\n\nHe could speak more freely now.  \"There were several reasons against\nmy telling you rashly.  One was what I have said; another, that\nit was always impressed upon me that I ought not to marry--that\nI belonged to an odd and peculiar family--the wrong breed for\nmarriage.\"\n\n\"Ah--who used to say that to you?\"\n\n\"My great-aunt. She said it always ended badly with us Fawleys.\"\n\n\"That's strange.  My father used to say the same to me!\"\n\nThey stood possessed by the same thought, ugly enough, even as an\nassumption: that a union between them, had such been possible, would\nhave meant a terrible intensification of unfitness--two bitters in\none dish.\n\n\"Oh, but there can't be anything in it!\" she said with nervous\nlightness.  \"Our family have been unlucky of late years in choosing\nmates--that's all.\"\n\nAnd then they pretended to persuade themselves that all that had\nhappened was of no consequence, and that they could still be cousins\nand friends and warm correspondents, and have happy genial times\nwhen they met, even if they met less frequently than before.  Their\nparting was in good friendship, and yet Jude's last look into her\neyes was tinged with inquiry, for he felt that he did not even now\nquite know her mind.\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nTidings from Sue a day or two after passed across Jude like a\nwithering blast.\n\nBefore reading the letter he was led to suspect that its contents\nwere of a somewhat serious kind by catching sight of the\nsignature--which was in her full name, never used in her\ncorrespondence with him since her first note:\n\n\n   MY DEAR JUDE,--I have something to tell you which perhaps\n   you will not be surprised to hear, though certainly it may\n   strike you as being accelerated (as the railway companies\n   say of their trains). Mr. Phillotson and I are to be married\n   quite soon--in three or four weeks.  We had intended, as you\n   know, to wait till I had gone through my course of training\n   and obtained my certificate, so as to assist him, if\n   necessary, in the teaching.  But he generously says he does\n   not see any object in waiting, now I am not at the training\n   school.  It is so good of him, because the awkwardness of my\n   situation has really come about by my fault in getting\n   expelled.\n\n   Wish me joy.  Remember I say you are to, and you mustn't\n   refuse!--Your affectionate cousin,\n\n   SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY BRIDEHEAD.\n\n\nJude staggered under the news; could eat no breakfast; and kept on\ndrinking tea because his mouth was so dry.  Then presently he went\nback to his work and laughed the usual bitter laugh of a man so\nconfronted.  Everything seemed turning to satire.  And yet, what\ncould the poor girl do? he asked himself, and felt worse than\nshedding tears.\n\n\"O Susanna Florence Mary!\" he said as he worked.  \"You don't know\nwhat marriage means!\"\n\nCould it be possible that his announcement of his own marriage had\npricked her on to this, just as his visit to her when in liquor may\nhave pricked her on to her engagement?  To be sure, there seemed to\nexist these other and sufficient reasons, practical and social, for\nher decision; but Sue was not a very practical or calculating person;\nand he was compelled to think that a pique at having his secret\nsprung upon her had moved her to give way to Phillotson's probable\nrepresentations, that the best course to prove how unfounded were the\nsuspicions of the school authorities would be to marry him off-hand,\nas in fulfilment of an ordinary engagement.  Sue had, in fact, been\nplaced in an awkward corner.  Poor Sue!\n\nHe determined to play the Spartan; to make the best of it, and\nsupport her; but he could not write the requested good wishes for a\nday or two.  Meanwhile there came another note from his impatient\nlittle dear:\n\n\n   Jude, will you give me away?  I have nobody else who could\n   do it so conveniently as you, being the only married relation\n   I have here on the spot, even if my father were friendly\n   enough to be willing, which he isn't.  I hope you won't think\n   it a trouble?  I have been looking at the marriage service in\n   the prayer-book, and it seems to me very humiliating that a\n   giver-away should be required at all.  According to the\n   ceremony as there printed, my bridegroom chooses me of his\n   own will and pleasure; but I don't choose him.  Somebody\n   GIVES me to him, like a she-ass or she-goat, or any other\n   domestic animal.  Bless your exalted views of woman, O\n   churchman!  But I forget: I am no longer privileged to tease\n   you.--Ever,\n\n   SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY BRIDEHEAD.\n\n\nJude screwed himself up to heroic key; and replied:\n\n\n   MY DEAR SUE,--Of course I wish you joy!  And also of course\n   I will give you away.  What I suggest is that, as you have\n   no house of your own, you do not marry from your school\n   friend's, but from mine.  It would be more proper, I think,\n   since I am, as you say, the person nearest related to you in\n   this part of the world.\n\n   I don't see why you sign your letter in such a new and\n   terribly formal way?  Surely you care a bit about me\n   still!--Ever your affectionate,\n\n   JUDE.\n\n\nWhat had jarred on him even more than the signature was a little\nsting he had been silent on--the phrase \"married relation\"--What an\nidiot it made him seem as her lover!  If Sue had written that in\nsatire, he could hardly forgive her; if in suffering--ah, that was\nanother thing!\n\nHis offer of his lodging must have commended itself to Phillotson\nat any rate, for the schoolmaster sent him a line of warm thanks,\naccepting the convenience.  Sue also thanked him.  Jude immediately\nmoved into more commodious quarters, as much to escape the espionage\nof the suspicious landlady who had been one cause of Sue's unpleasant\nexperience as for the sake of room.\n\nThen Sue wrote to tell him the day fixed for the wedding; and Jude\ndecided, after inquiry, that she should come into residence on the\nfollowing Saturday, which would allow of a ten days' stay in the city\nprior to the ceremony, sufficiently representing a nominal residence\nof fifteen.\n\nShe arrived by the ten o'clock train on the day aforesaid, Jude not\ngoing to meet her at the station, by her special request, that he\nshould not lose a morning's work and pay, she said (if this were\nher true reason).  But so well by this time did he know Sue that the\nremembrance of their mutual sensitiveness at emotional crises might,\nhe thought, have weighed with her in this.  When he came home to\ndinner she had taken possession of her apartment.\n\nShe lived in the same house with him, but on a different floor, and\nthey saw each other little, an occasional supper being the only meal\nthey took together, when Sue's manner was something like that of a\nscared child.  What she felt he did not know; their conversation was\nmechanical, though she did not look pale or ill.  Phillotson came\nfrequently, but mostly when Jude was absent.  On the morning of the\nwedding, when Jude had given himself a holiday, Sue and her cousin\nhad breakfast together for the first and last time during this\ncurious interval; in his room--the parlour--which he had hired for\nthe period of Sue's residence.  Seeing, as women do, how helpless he\nwas in making the place comfortable, she bustled about.\n\n\"What's the matter, Jude?\" she said suddenly.\n\nHe was leaning with his elbows on the table and his chin on his\nhands, looking into a futurity which seemed to be sketched out on the\ntablecloth.\n\n\"Oh--nothing!\"\n\n\"You are 'father', you know.  That's what they call the man who gives\nyou away.\"\n\nJude could have said \"Phillotson's age entitles him to be called\nthat!\"  But he would not annoy her by such a cheap retort.\n\nShe talked incessantly, as if she dreaded his indulgence in\nreflection, and before the meal was over both he and she wished they\nhad not put such confidence in their new view of things, and had\ntaken breakfast apart.  What oppressed Jude was the thought that,\nhaving done a wrong thing of this sort himself, he was aiding and\nabetting the woman he loved in doing a like wrong thing, instead of\nimploring and warning her against it.  It was on his tongue to say,\n\"You have quite made up your mind?\"\n\nAfter breakfast they went out on an errand together moved by a mutual\nthought that it was the last opportunity they would have of indulging\nin unceremonious companionship.  By the irony of fate, and the\ncurious trick in Sue's nature of tempting Providence at critical\ntimes, she took his arm as they walked through the muddy street--a\nthing she had never done before in her life--and on turning the\ncorner they found themselves close to a grey perpendicular church\nwith a low-pitched roof--the church of St. Thomas.\n\n\"That's the church,\" said Jude.\n\n\"Where I am going to be married?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" she exclaimed with curiosity.  \"How I should like to go in\nand see what the spot is like where I am so soon to kneel and do it.\"\n\nAgain he said to himself, \"She does not realize what marriage means!\"\n\nHe passively acquiesced in her wish to go in, and they entered by\nthe western door.  The only person inside the gloomy building was\na charwoman cleaning.  Sue still held Jude's arm, almost as if she\nloved him.  Cruelly sweet, indeed, she had been to him that morning;\nbut his thoughts of a penance in store for her were tempered by an\nache:\n\n\n                          ... I can find no way\n   How a blow should fall, such as falls on men,\n   Nor prove too much for your womanhood!\n\n\nThey strolled undemonstratively up the nave towards the altar\nrailing, which they stood against in silence, turning then and\nwalking down the nave again, her hand still on his arm, precisely\nlike a couple just married.  The too suggestive incident, entirely\nof her making, nearly broke down Jude.\n\n\"I like to do things like this,\" she said in the delicate voice of an\nepicure in emotions, which left no doubt that she spoke the truth.\n\n\"I know you do!\" said Jude.\n\n\"They are interesting, because they have probably never been done\nbefore.  I shall walk down the church like this with my husband in\nabout two hours, shan't I!\"\n\n\"No doubt you will!\"\n\n\"Was it like this when you were married?\"\n\n\"Good God, Sue--don't be so awfully merciless! ...  There, dear one,\nI didn't mean it!\"\n\n\"Ah--you are vexed!\" she said regretfully, as she blinked away an\naccess of eye moisture.  \"And I promised never to vex you! ...  I\nsuppose I ought not to have asked you to bring me in here.  Oh, I\noughtn't!  I see it now.  My curiosity to hunt up a new sensation\nalways leads me into these scrapes.  Forgive me! ...  You will, won't\nyou, Jude?\"\n\nThe appeal was so remorseful that Jude's eyes were even wetter than\nhers as he pressed her hand for Yes.\n\n\"Now we'll hurry away, and I won't do it any more!\" she continued\nhumbly; and they came out of the building, Sue intending to go\non to the station to meet Phillotson.  But the first person they\nencountered on entering the main street was the schoolmaster himself,\nwhose train had arrived sooner than Sue expected.  There was nothing\nreally to demur to in her leaning on Jude's arm; but she withdrew her\nhand, and Jude thought that Phillotson had looked surprised.\n\n\"We have been doing such a funny thing!\" said she, smiling candidly.\n\"We've been to the church, rehearsing as it were.  Haven't we, Jude?\"\n\n\"How?\" said Phillotson curiously.\n\nJude inwardly deplored what he thought to be unnecessary frankness;\nbut she had gone too far not to explain all, which she accordingly\ndid, telling him how they had marched up to the altar.\n\nSeeing how puzzled Phillotson seemed, Jude said as cheerfully as he\ncould, \"I am going to buy her another little present.  Will you both\ncome to the shop with me?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Sue, \"I'll go on to the house with him\"; and requesting\nher lover not to be a long time she departed with the schoolmaster.\n\nJude soon joined them at his rooms, and shortly after they prepared\nfor the ceremony.  Phillotson's hair was brushed to a painful\nextent, and his shirt collar appeared stiffer than it had been for\nthe previous twenty years.  Beyond this he looked dignified and\nthoughtful, and altogether a man of whom it was not unsafe to predict\nthat he would make a kind and considerate husband.  That he adored\nSue was obvious; and she could almost be seen to feel that she was\nundeserving his adoration.\n\nAlthough the distance was so short he had hired a fly from the Red\nLion, and six or seven women and children had gathered by the door\nwhen they came out.  The schoolmaster and Sue were unknown, though\nJude was getting to be recognized as a citizen; and the couple were\njudged to be some relations of his from a distance, nobody supposing\nSue to have been a recent pupil at the training school.\n\nIn the carriage Jude took from his pocket his extra little\nwedding-present, which turned out to be two or three yards of white\ntulle, which he threw over her bonnet and all, as a veil.\n\n\"It looks so odd over a bonnet,\" she said.  \"I'll take the bonnet\noff.\"\n\n\"Oh no--let it stay,\" said Phillotson.  And she obeyed.\n\nWhen they had passed up the church and were standing in their places\nJude found that the antecedent visit had certainly taken off the edge\nof this performance, but by the time they were half-way on with the\nservice he wished from his heart that he had not undertaken the\nbusiness of giving her away.  How could Sue have had the temerity to\nask him to do it--a cruelty possibly to herself as well as to him?\nWomen were different from men in such matters.  Was it that they\nwere, instead of more sensitive, as reputed, more callous, and less\nromantic; or were they more heroic?  Or was Sue simply so perverse\nthat she wilfully gave herself and him pain for the odd and mournful\nluxury of practising long-suffering in her own person, and of being\ntouched with tender pity for him at having made him practise it?  He\ncould perceive that her face was nervously set, and when they reached\nthe trying ordeal of Jude giving her to Phillotson she could hardly\ncommand herself; rather, however, as it seemed, from her knowledge of\nwhat her cousin must feel, whom she need not have had there at all,\nthan from self-consideration.  Possibly she would go on inflicting\nsuch pains again and again, and grieving for the sufferer again and\nagain, in all her colossal inconsistency.\n\nPhillotson seemed not to notice, to be surrounded by a mist which\nprevented his seeing the emotions of others.  As soon as they had\nsigned their names and come away, and the suspense was over, Jude\nfelt relieved.\n\nThe meal at his lodging was a very simple affair, and at two o'clock\nthey went off.  In crossing the pavement to the fly she looked back;\nand there was a frightened light in her eyes.  Could it be that Sue\nhad acted with such unusual foolishness as to plunge into she knew\nnot what for the sake of asserting her independence of him, of\nretaliating on him for his secrecy?  Perhaps Sue was thus venturesome\nwith men because she was childishly ignorant of that side of their\nnatures which wore out women's hearts and lives.\n\nWhen her foot was on the carriage-step she turned round, saying that\nshe had forgotten something.  Jude and the landlady offered to get\nit.\n\n\"No,\" she said, running back.  \"It is my handkerchief.  I know where\nI left it.\"\n\nJude followed her back.  She had found it, and came holding it in her\nhand.  She looked into his eyes with her own tearful ones, and her\nlips suddenly parted as if she were going to avow something.  But she\nwent on; and whatever she had meant to say remained unspoken.\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nJude wondered if she had really left her handkerchief behind; or\nwhether it were that she had miserably wished to tell him of a love\nthat at the last moment she could not bring herself to express.\n\nHe could not stay in his silent lodging when they were gone, and\nfearing that he might be tempted to drown his misery in alcohol he\nwent upstairs, changed his dark clothes for his white, his thin boots\nfor his thick, and proceeded to his customary work for the afternoon.\n\nBut in the cathedral he seemed to hear a voice behind him, and to\nbe possessed with an idea that she would come back.  She could not\npossibly go home with Phillotson, he fancied.  The feeling grew and\nstirred.  The moment that the clock struck the last of his working\nhours he threw down his tools and rushed homeward.  \"Has anybody been\nfor me?\" he asked.\n\nNobody had been there.\n\nAs he could claim the downstairs sitting-room till twelve o'clock\nthat night he sat in it all the evening; and even when the clock had\nstruck eleven, and the family had retired, he could not shake off\nthe feeling that she would come back and sleep in the little room\nadjoining his own in which she had slept so many previous days.  Her\nactions were always unpredictable: why should she not come?  Gladly\nwould he have compounded for the denial of her as a sweetheart and\nwife by having her live thus as a fellow-lodger and friend, even on\nthe most distant terms.  His supper still remained spread, and going\nto the front door, and softly setting it open, he returned to the\nroom and sat as watchers sit on Old-Midsummer eves, expecting the\nphantom of the Beloved.  But she did not come.\n\nHaving indulged in this wild hope he went upstairs, and looked out of\nthe window, and pictured her through the evening journey to London,\nwhither she and Phillotson had gone for their holiday; their rattling\nalong through the damp night to their hotel, under the same sky of\nribbed cloud as that he beheld, through which the moon showed its\nposition rather than its shape, and one or two of the larger stars\nmade themselves visible as faint nebul\u00c3\u00a6 only.  It was a new\nbeginning of Sue's history.  He projected his mind into the future,\nand saw her with children more or less in her own likeness around\nher.  But the consolation of regarding them as a continuation of\nher identity was denied to him, as to all such dreamers, by the\nwilfulness of Nature in not allowing issue from one parent alone.\nEvery desired renewal of an existence is debased by being half alloy.\n\"If at the estrangement or death of my lost love, I could go and see\nher child--hers solely--there would be comfort in it!\" said Jude.\nAnd then he again uneasily saw, as he had latterly seen with more and\nmore frequency, the scorn of Nature for man's finer emotions, and her\nlack of interest in his aspirations.\n\nThe oppressive strength of his affection for Sue showed itself on\nthe morrow and following days yet more clearly.  He could no longer\nendure the light of the Melchester lamps; the sunshine was as drab\npaint, and the blue sky as zinc.  Then he received news that his old\naunt was dangerously ill at Marygreen, which intelligence almost\ncoincided with a letter from his former employer at Christminster,\nwho offered him permanent work of a good class if he would come back.\nThe letters were almost a relief to him.  He started to visit Aunt\nDrusilla, and resolved to go onward to Christminster to see what\nworth there might be in the builder's offer.\n\nJude found his aunt even worse than the communication from the Widow\nEdlin had led him to expect.  There was every possibility of her\nlingering on for weeks or months, though little likelihood.  He wrote\nto Sue informing her of the state of her aunt, and suggesting that\nshe might like to see her aged relative alive.  He would meet her at\nAlfredston Road, the following evening, Monday, on his way back from\nChristminster, if she could come by the up-train which crossed his\ndown-train at that station.  Next morning, according, he went on to\nChristminster, intending to return to Alfredston soon enough to keep\nthe suggested appointment with Sue.\n\nThe city of learning wore an estranged look, and he had lost all\nfeeling for its associations.  Yet as the sun made vivid lights\nand shades of the mullioned architecture of the fa\u00c3\u00a7ades, and drew\npatterns of the crinkled battlements on the young turf of the\nquadrangles, Jude thought he had never seen the place look more\nbeautiful.  He came to the street in which he had first beheld Sue.\nThe chair she had occupied when, leaning over her ecclesiastical\nscrolls, a hog-hair brush in her hand, her girlish figure had\narrested the gaze of his inquiring eyes, stood precisely in its\nformer spot, empty.  It was as if she were dead, and nobody had been\nfound capable of succeeding her in that artistic pursuit.  Hers was\nnow the city phantom, while those of the intellectual and devotional\nworthies who had once moved him to emotion were no longer able to\nassert their presence there.\n\nHowever, here he was; and in fulfilment of his intention he went on\nto his former lodging in \"Beersheba,\" near the ritualistic church of\nSt. Silas.  The old landlady who opened the door seemed glad to see\nhim again, and bringing some lunch informed him that the builder who\nhad employed him had called to inquire his address.\n\nJude went on to the stone-yard where he had worked.  But the old\nsheds and bankers were distasteful to him; he felt it impossible to\nengage himself to return and stay in this place of vanished dreams.\nHe longed for the hour of the homeward train to Alfredston, where he\nmight probably meet Sue.\n\nThen, for one ghastly half-hour of depression caused by these scenes,\nthere returned upon him that feeling which had been his undoing more\nthan once--that he was not worth the trouble of being taken care of\neither by himself or others; and during this half-hour he met Tinker\nTaylor, the bankrupt ecclesiastical ironmonger, at Fourways, who\nproposed that they should adjourn to a bar and drink together.\nThey walked along the street till they stood before one of the\ngreat palpitating centres of Christminster life, the inn wherein he\nformerly had responded to the challenge to rehearse the Creed in\nLatin--now a popular tavern with a spacious and inviting entrance,\nwhich gave admittance to a bar that had been entirely renovated and\nrefitted in modern style since Jude's residence here.\n\nTinker Taylor drank off his glass and departed, saying it was too\nstylish a place now for him to feel at home in unless he was drunker\nthan he had money to be just then.  Jude was longer finishing his,\nand stood abstractedly silent in the, for the minute, almost empty\nplace.  The bar had been gutted and newly arranged throughout,\nmahogany fixtures having taken the place of the old painted\nones, while at the back of the standing-space there were stuffed\nsofa-benches.  The room was divided into compartments in the approved\nmanner, between which were screens of ground glass in mahogany\nframing, to prevent topers in one compartment being put to the blush\nby the recognitions of those in the next.  On the inside of the\ncounter two barmaids leant over the white-handled beer-engines,\nand the row of little silvered taps inside, dripping into a pewter\ntrough.\n\nFeeling tired, and having nothing more to do till the train left,\nJude sat down on one of the sofas.  At the back of the barmaids rose\nbevel-edged mirrors, with glass shelves running along their front,\non which stood precious liquids that Jude did not know the name\nof, in bottles of topaz, sapphire, ruby and amethyst.  The moment\nwas enlivened by the entrance of some customers into the next\ncompartment, and the starting of the mechanical tell-tale of monies\nreceived, which emitted a ting-ting every time a coin was put in.\n\nThe barmaid attending to this compartment was invisible to Jude's\ndirect glance, though a reflection of her back in the glass behind\nher was occasionally caught by his eyes.  He had only observed this\nlistlessly, when she turned her face for a moment to the glass to set\nher hair tidy.  Then he was amazed to discover that the face was\nArabella's.\n\nIf she had come on to his compartment she would have seen him.\nBut she did not, this being presided over by the maiden on the other\nside.  Abby was in a black gown, with white linen cuffs and a broad\nwhite collar, and her figure, more developed than formerly, was\naccentuated by a bunch of daffodils that she wore on her left bosom.\nIn the compartment she served stood an electro-plated fountain of\nwater over a spirit-lamp, whose blue flame sent a steam from the top,\nall this being visible to him only in the mirror behind her; which\nalso reflected the faces of the men she was attending to--one of them\na handsome, dissipated young fellow, possibly an undergraduate, who\nhad been relating to her an experience of some humorous sort.\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Cockman, now!  How can you tell such a tale to me in my\ninnocence!\" she cried gaily.  \"Mr. Cockman, what do you use to make\nyour moustache curl so beautiful?\"  As the young man was clean shaven,\nthe retort provoked a laugh at his expense.\n\n\"Come!\" said he, \"I'll have a cura\u00c3\u00a7ao; and a light, please.\"\n\nShe served the liqueur from one of the lovely bottles and striking\na match held it to his cigarette with ministering archness while he\nwhiffed.\n\n\"Well, have you heard from your husband lately, my dear?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not a sound,\" said she.\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"I left him in Australia; and I suppose he's there still.\"\n\nJude's eyes grew rounder.\n\n\"What made you part from him?\"\n\n\"Don't you ask questions, and you won't hear lies.\"\n\n\"Come then, give me my change, which you've been keeping from me for\nthe last quarter of an hour; and I'll romantically vanish up the\nstreet of this picturesque city.\"\n\nShe handed the change over the counter, in taking which he caught her\nfingers and held them.  There was a slight struggle and titter, and\nhe bade her good-bye and left.\n\nJude had looked on with the eye of a dazed philosopher.  It was\nextraordinary how far removed from his life Arabella now seemed to\nbe.  He could not realize their nominal closeness.  And, this being\nthe case, in his present frame of mind he was indifferent to the fact\nthat Arabella was his wife indeed.\n\nThe compartment that she served emptied itself of visitors, and\nafter a brief thought he entered it, and went forward to the counter.\nArabella did not recognize him for a moment.  Then their glances met.\nShe started; till a humorous impudence sparkled in her eyes, and she\nspoke.\n\n\"Well, I'm blest!  I thought you were underground years ago!\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"I never heard anything of you, or I don't know that I should\nhave come here.  But never mind!  What shall I treat you to this\nafternoon?  A Scotch and soda?  Come, anything that the house will\nafford, for old acquaintance' sake!\"\n\n\"Thanks, Arabella,\" said Jude without a smile.  \"But I don't want\nanything more than I've had.\"  The fact was that her unexpected\npresence there had destroyed at a stroke his momentary taste for\nstrong liquor as completely as if it had whisked him back to his\nmilk-fed infancy.\n\n\"That's a pity, now you could get it for nothing.\"\n\n\"How long have you been here?\"\n\n\"About six weeks.  I returned from Sydney three months ago.  I always\nliked this business, you know.\"\n\n\"I wonder you came to this place!\"\n\n\"Well, as I say, I thought you were gone to glory, and being in\nLondon I saw the situation in an advertisement.  Nobody was likely to\nknow me here, even if I had minded, for I was never in Christminster\nin my growing up.\"\n\n\"Why did you return from Australia?\"\n\n\"Oh, I had my reasons...  Then you are not a don yet?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Not even a reverend?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Nor so much as a rather reverend dissenting gentleman?\"\n\n\"I am as I was.\"\n\n\"True--you look so.\"  She idly allowed her fingers to rest on the\npull of the beer-engine as she inspected him critically.  He observed\nthat her hands were smaller and whiter than when he had lived with\nher, and that on the hand which pulled the engine she wore an\nornamental ring set with what seemed to be real sapphires--which they\nwere, indeed, and were much admired as such by the young men who\nfrequented the bar.\n\n\"So you pass as having a living husband,\" he continued.\n\n\"Yes.  I thought it might be awkward if I called myself a widow, as I\nshould have liked.\"\n\n\"True.  I am known here a little.\"\n\n\"I didn't mean on that account--for as I said I didn't expect you.\nIt was for other reasons.\"\n\n\"What were they?\"\n\n\"I don't care to go into them,\" she replied evasively.  \"I make a\nvery good living, and I don't know that I want your company.\"\n\nHere a chappie with no chin, and a moustache like a lady's eyebrow,\ncame and asked for a curiously compounded drink, and Arabella was\nobliged to go and attend to him.  \"We can't talk here,\" she said,\nstepping back a moment.  \"Can't you wait till nine?  Say yes, and\ndon't be a fool.  I can get off duty two hours sooner than usual, if\nI ask.  I am not living in the house at present.\"\n\nHe reflected and said gloomily, \"I'll come back.  I suppose we'd\nbetter arrange something.\"\n\n\"Oh, bother arranging!  I'm not going to arrange anything!\"\n\n\"But I must know a thing or two; and, as you say, we can't talk here.\nVery well; I'll call for you.\"\n\nDepositing his unemptied glass he went out and walked up and down the\nstreet.  Here was a rude flounce into the pellucid sentimentality of\nhis sad attachment to Sue.  Though Arabella's word was absolutely\nuntrustworthy, he thought there might be some truth in her\nimplication that she had not wished to disturb him, and had really\nsupposed him dead.  However, there was only one thing now to be done,\nand that was to play a straightforward part, the law being the law,\nand the woman between whom and himself there was no more unity than\nbetween east and west, being in the eye of the Church one person with\nhim.\n\nHaving to meet Arabella here, it was impossible to meet Sue at\nAlfredston as he had promised.  At every thought of this a pang\nhad gone through him; but the conjuncture could not be helped.\nArabella was perhaps an intended intervention to punish him for his\nunauthorized love.  Passing the evening, therefore, in a desultory\nwaiting about the town wherein he avoided the precincts of every\ncloister and hall, because he could not bear to behold them, he\nrepaired to the tavern bar while the hundred and one strokes were\nresounding from the Great Bell of Cardinal College, a coincidence\nwhich seemed to him gratuitous irony.  The inn was now brilliantly\nlighted up, and the scene was altogether more brisk and gay.  The\nfaces of the barmaidens had risen in colour, each having a pink\nflush on her cheek; their manners were still more vivacious than\nbefore--more abandoned, more excited, more sensuous, and they\nexpressed their sentiments and desires less euphemistically, laughing\nin a lackadaisical tone, without reserve.\n\nThe bar had been crowded with men of all sorts during the previous\nhour, and he had heard from without the hubbub of their voices; but\nthe customers were fewer at last.  He nodded to Arabella, and told\nher that she would find him outside the door when she came away.\n\n\"But you must have something with me first,\" she said with great\ngood humour.  \"Just an early night-cap: I always do.  Then you can\ngo out and wait a minute, as it is best we should not be seen going\ntogether.\"  She drew a couple of liqueur glasses of brandy; and\nthough she had evidently, from her countenance, already taken in\nenough alcohol either by drinking or, more probably, from the\natmosphere she had breathed for so many hours, she finished hers\nquickly.  He also drank his, and went outside the house.\n\nIn a few minutes she came, in a thick jacket and a hat with a black\nfeather.  \"I live quite near,\" she said, taking his arm, \"and can let\nmyself in by a latch-key at any time.  What arrangement do you want\nto come to?\"\n\n\"Oh--none in particular,\" he answered, thoroughly sick and tired, his\nthoughts again reverting to Alfredston, and the train he did not go\nby; the probable disappointment of Sue that he was not there when\nshe arrived, and the missed pleasure of her company on the long and\nlonely climb by starlight up the hills to Marygreen.  \"I ought to\nhave gone back really!  My aunt is on her deathbed, I fear.\"\n\n\"I'll go over with you to-morrow morning.  I think I could get a day\noff.\"\n\nThere was something particularly uncongenial in the idea of Arabella,\nwho had no more sympathy than a tigress with his relations or him,\ncoming to the bedside of his dying aunt, and meeting Sue.  Yet he\nsaid, \"Of course, if you'd like to, you can.\"\n\n\"Well, that we'll consider...  Now, until we have come to some\nagreement it is awkward our being together here--where you are known,\nand I am getting known, though without any suspicion that I have\nanything to do with you.  As we are going towards the station,\nsuppose we take the nine-forty train to Aldbrickham?  We shall be\nthere in little more than half an hour, and nobody will know us for\none night, and we shall be quite free to act as we choose till we\nhave made up our minds whether we'll make anything public or not.\"\n\n\"As you like.\"\n\n\"Then wait till I get two or three things.  This is my lodging.\nSometimes when late I sleep at the hotel where I am engaged, so\nnobody will think anything of my staying out.\"\n\nShe speedily returned, and they went on to the railway, and made the\nhalf-hour's journey to Aldbrickham, where they entered a third-rate\ninn near the station in time for a late supper.\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nOn the morrow between nine and half-past they were journeying back\nto Christminster, the only two occupants of a compartment in a\nthird-class railway-carriage.  Having, like Jude, made rather a\nhasty toilet to catch the train, Arabella looked a little frowsy,\nand her face was very far from possessing the animation which had\ncharacterized it at the bar the night before.  When they came out of\nthe station she found that she still had half an hour to spare before\nshe was due at the bar.  They walked in silence a little way out of\nthe town in the direction of Alfredston.  Jude looked up the far\nhighway.\n\n\"Ah ... poor feeble me!\" he murmured at last.\n\n\"What?\" said she.\n\n\"This is the very road by which I came into Christminster years ago\nfull of plans!\"\n\n\"Well, whatever the road is I think my time is nearly up, as I have\nto be in the bar by eleven o'clock.  And as I said, I shan't ask for\nthe day to go with you to see your aunt.  So perhaps we had better\npart here.  I'd sooner not walk up Chief Street with you, since we've\ncome to no conclusion at all.\"\n\n\"Very well.  But you said when we were getting up this morning that\nyou had something you wished to tell me before I left?\"\n\n\"So I had--two things--one in particular.  But you wouldn't promise\nto keep it a secret.  I'll tell you now if you promise?  As an honest\nwoman I wish you to know it...  It was what I began telling you\nin the night--about that gentleman who managed the Sydney hotel.\"\nArabella spoke somewhat hurriedly for her.  \"You'll keep it close?\"\n\n\"Yes--yes--I promise!\" said Jude impatiently.  \"Of course I don't\nwant to reveal your secrets.\"\n\n\"Whenever I met him out for a walk, he used to say that he was much\ntaken with my looks, and he kept pressing me to marry him.  I never\nthought of coming back to England again; and being out there in\nAustralia, with no home of my own after leaving my father, I at last\nagreed, and did.\"\n\n\"What--marry him?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Regularly--legally--in church?\"\n\n\"Yes.  And lived with him till shortly before I left.  It was stupid,\nI know; but I did!  There, now I've told you.  Don't round upon me!\nHe talks of coming back to England, poor old chap.  But if he does,\nhe won't be likely to find me.\"\n\nJude stood pale and fixed.\n\n\"Why the devil didn't you tell me last, night!\" he said.\n\n\"Well--I didn't...  Won't you make it up with me, then?\"\n\n\"So in talking of 'your husband' to the bar gentlemen you meant him,\nof course--not me!\"\n\n\"Of course...  Come, don't fuss about it.\"\n\n\"I have nothing more to say!\" replied Jude.  \"I have nothing at all\nto say about the--crime--you've confessed to!\"\n\n\"Crime!  Pooh.  They don't think much of such as that over there!\nLots of 'em do it...  Well, if you take it like that I shall go back\nto him!  He was very fond of me, and we lived honourable enough, and\nas respectable as any married couple in the colony!  How did I know\nwhere you were?\"\n\n\"I won't go blaming you.  I could say a good deal; but perhaps it\nwould be misplaced.  What do you wish me to do?\"\n\n\"Nothing.  There was one thing more I wanted to tell you; but I fancy\nwe've seen enough of one another for the present!  I shall think over\nwhat you said about your circumstances, and let you know.\"\n\nThus they parted.  Jude watched her disappear in the direction of\nthe hotel, and entered the railway station close by.  Finding that\nit wanted three-quarters of an hour of the time at which he could\nget a train back to Alfredston, he strolled mechanically into the\ncity as far as to the Fourways, where he stood as he had so often\nstood before, and surveyed Chief Street stretching ahead, with its\ncollege after college, in picturesqueness unrivalled except by such\nContinental vistas as the Street of Palaces in Genoa; the lines\nof the buildings being as distinct in the morning air as in an\narchitectural drawing.  But Jude was far from seeing or criticizing\nthese things; they were hidden by an indescribable consciousness of\nArabella's midnight contiguity, a sense of degradation at his revived\nexperiences with her, of her appearance as she lay asleep at dawn,\nwhich set upon his motionless face a look as of one accurst.  If he\ncould only have felt resentment towards her he would have been less\nunhappy; but he pitied while he contemned her.\n\nJude turned and retraced his steps.  Drawing again towards the\nstation he started at hearing his name pronounced--less at the name\nthan at the voice.  To his great surprise no other than Sue stood\nlike a vision before him--her look bodeful and anxious as in a dream,\nher little mouth nervous, and her strained eyes speaking reproachful\ninquiry.\n\n\"Oh, Jude--I am so glad--to meet you like this!\" she said in quick,\nuneven accents not far from a sob.  Then she flushed as she observed\nhis thought that they had not met since her marriage.\n\nThey looked away from each other to hide their emotion, took each\nother's hand without further speech, and went on together awhile,\ntill she glanced at him with furtive solicitude.  \"I arrived at\nAlfredston station last night, as you asked me to, and there was\nnobody to meet me!  But I reached Marygreen alone, and they told me\nAunt was a trifle better.  I sat up with her, and as you did not come\nall night I was frightened about you--I thought that perhaps, when\nyou found yourself back in the old city, you were upset at--at\nthinking I was--married, and not there as I used to be; and that you\nhad nobody to speak to; so you had tried to drown your gloom--as you\ndid at that former time when you were disappointed about entering as\na student, and had forgotten your promise to me that you never would\nagain.  And this, I thought, was why you hadn't come to meet me!\"\n\n\"And you came to hunt me up, and deliver me, like a good angel!\"\n\n\"I thought I would come by the morning train and try to find you--in\ncase--in case--\"\n\n\"I did think of my promise to you, dear, continually!  I shall never\nbreak out again as I did, I am sure.  I may have been doing nothing\nbetter, but I was not doing that--I loathe the thought of it.\"\n\n\"I am glad your staying had nothing to do with that.  But,\" she said,\nthe faintest pout entering into her tone, \"you didn't come back last\nnight and meet me, as you engaged to!\"\n\n\"I didn't--I am sorry to say.  I had an appointment at nine\no'clock--too late for me to catch the train that would have met\nyours, or to get home at all.\"\n\nLooking at his loved one as she appeared to him now, in his tender\nthought the sweetest and most disinterested comrade that he had ever\nhad, living largely in vivid imaginings, so ethereal a creature\nthat her spirit could be seen trembling through her limbs, he felt\nheartily ashamed of his earthliness in spending the hours he had\nspent in Arabella's company.  There was something rude and immoral\nin thrusting these recent facts of his life upon the mind of one who,\nto him, was so uncarnate as to seem at times impossible as a human\nwife to any average man.  And yet she was Phillotson's.  How she had\nbecome such, how she lived as such, passed his comprehension as he\nregarded her to-day.\n\n\"You'll go back with me?\" he said.  \"There's a train just now.  I\nwonder how my aunt is by this time...  And so, Sue, you really came\non my account all this way!  At what an early time you must have\nstarted, poor thing!\"\n\n\"Yes.  Sitting up watching alone made me all nerves for you, and\ninstead of going to bed when it got light I started.  And now you\nwon't frighten me like this again about your morals for nothing?\"\n\nHe was not so sure that she had been frightened about his morals for\nnothing.  He released her hand till they had entered the train,--it\nseemed the same carriage he had lately got out of with another--where\nthey sat down side by side, Sue between him and the window.  He\nregarded the delicate lines of her profile, and the small, tight,\napplelike convexities of her bodice, so different from Arabella's\namplitudes.  Though she knew he was looking at her she did not turn\nto him, but kept her eyes forward, as if afraid that by meeting his\nown some troublous discussion would be initiated.\n\n\"Sue--you are married now, you know, like me; and yet we have been in\nsuch a hurry that we have not said a word about it!\"\n\n\"There's no necessity,\" she quickly returned.\n\n\"Oh well--perhaps not...  But I wish\"\n\n\"Jude--don't talk about ME--I wish you wouldn't!\" she entreated.\n\"It distresses me, rather.  Forgive my saying it! ...  Where did you\nstay last night?\"\n\nShe had asked the question in perfect innocence, to change the topic.\nHe knew that, and said merely, \"At an inn,\" though it would have been\na relief to tell her of his meeting with an unexpected one.  But the\nlatter's final announcement of her marriage in Australia bewildered\nhim lest what he might say should do his ignorant wife an injury.\n\nTheir talk proceeded but awkwardly till they reached Alfredston.\nThat Sue was not as she had been, but was labelled \"Phillotson,\"\nparalyzed Jude whenever he wanted to commune with her as an\nindividual.  Yet she seemed unaltered--he could not say why.\nThere remained the five-mile extra journey into the country, which\nit was just as easy to walk as to drive, the greater part of it being\nuphill.  Jude had never before in his life gone that road with Sue,\nthough he had with another.  It was now as if he carried a bright\nlight which temporarily banished the shady associations of the\nearlier time.\n\nSue talked; but Jude noticed that she still kept the conversation\nfrom herself.  At length he inquired if her husband were well.\n\n\"O yes,\" she said.  \"He is obliged to be in the school all the day,\nor he would have come with me.  He is so good and kind that to\naccompany me he would have dismissed the school for once, even\nagainst his principles--for he is strongly opposed to giving casual\nholidays--only I wouldn't let him.  I felt it would be better to come\nalone.  Aunt Drusilla, I knew, was so very eccentric; and his being\nalmost a stranger to her now would have made it irksome to both.\nSince it turns out that she is hardly conscious I am glad I did not\nask him.\"\n\nJude had walked moodily while this praise of Phillotson was being\nexpressed.  \"Mr. Phillotson obliges you in everything, as he ought,\"\nhe said.\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"You ought to be a happy wife.\"\n\n\"And of course I am.\"\n\n\"Bride, I might almost have said, as yet.  It is not so many weeks\nsince I gave you to him, and--\"\n\n\"Yes, I know!  I know!\"  There was something in her face which belied\nher late assuring words, so strictly proper and so lifelessly spoken\nthat they might have been taken from a list of model speeches in \"The\nWife's Guide to Conduct.\"  Jude knew the quality of every vibration\nin Sue's voice, could read every symptom of her mental condition; and\nhe was convinced that she was unhappy, although she had not been a\nmonth married.  But her rushing away thus from home, to see the last\nof a relative whom she had hardly known in her life, proved nothing;\nfor Sue naturally did such things as those.\n\n\"Well, you have my good wishes now as always, Mrs. Phillotson.\"\n\nShe reproached him by a glance.\n\n\"No, you are not Mrs. Phillotson,\" murmured Jude.  \"You are dear,\nfree Sue Bridehead, only you don't know it!  Wifedom has not yet\nsquashed up and digested you in its vast maw as an atom which has no\nfurther individuality.\"\n\nSue put on a look of being offended, till she answered, \"Nor has\nhusbandom you, so far as I can see!\"\n\n\"But it has!\" he said, shaking his head sadly.\n\nWhen they reached the lone cottage under the firs, between the\nBrown House and Marygreen, in which Jude and Arabella had lived and\nquarrelled, he turned to look at it.  A squalid family lived there\nnow.  He could not help saying to Sue: \"That's the house my wife and\nI occupied the whole of the time we lived together.  I brought her\nhome to that house.\"\n\nShe looked at it.  \"That to you was what the school-house at Shaston\nis to me.\"\n\n\"Yes; but I was not very happy there as you are in yours.\"\n\nShe closed her lips in retortive silence, and they walked some way\ntill she glanced at him to see how he was taking it.  \"Of course I\nmay have exaggerated your happiness--one never knows,\" he continued\nblandly.\n\n\"Don't think that, Jude, for a moment, even though you may have said\nit to sting me!  He's as good to me as a man can be, and gives me\nperfect liberty--which elderly husbands don't do in general...  If\nyou think I am not happy because he's too old for me, you are wrong.\"\n\n\"I don't think anything against him--to you dear.\"\n\n\"And you won't say things to distress me, will you?\"\n\n\"I will not.\"\n\nHe said no more, but he knew that, from some cause or other, in\ntaking Phillotson as a husband, Sue felt that she had done what she\nought not to have done.\n\nThey plunged into the concave field on the other side of which rose\nthe village--the field wherein Jude had received a thrashing from\nthe farmer many years earlier.  On ascending to the village and\napproaching the house they found Mrs. Edlin standing at the door, who\nat sight of them lifted her hands deprecatingly.  \"She's downstairs,\nif you'll believe me!\" cried the widow.  \"Out o' bed she got, and\nnothing could turn her.  What will come o't I do not know!\"\n\nOn entering, there indeed by the fireplace sat the old woman, wrapped\nin blankets, and turning upon them a countenance like that of\nSebastiano's Lazarus.  They must have looked their amazement, for she\nsaid in a hollow voice:\n\n\"Ah--sceered ye, have I!  I wasn't going to bide up there no longer,\nto please nobody!  'Tis more than flesh and blood can bear, to be\nordered to do this and that by a feller that don't know half as well\nas you do yourself! ...  Ah--you'll rue this marrying as well as\nhe!\" she added, turning to Sue.  \"All our family do--and nearly all\neverybody else's.  You should have done as I did, you simpleton!  And\nPhillotson the schoolmaster, of all men!  What made 'ee marry him?\"\n\n\"What makes most women marry, Aunt?\"\n\n\"Ah!  You mean to say you loved the man!\"\n\n\"I don't meant to say anything definite.\"\n\n\"Do ye love un?\"\n\n\"Don't ask me, Aunt.\"\n\n\"I can mind the man very well.  A very civil, honourable liver; but\nLord!--I don't want to wownd your feelings, but--there be certain men\nhere and there that no woman of any niceness can stomach.  I should\nhave said he was one.  I don't say so NOW, since you must ha' known\nbetter than I--but that's what I SHOULD have said!\"\n\nSue jumped up and went out.  Jude followed her, and found her in the\nouthouse, crying.\n\n\"Don't cry, dear!\" said Jude in distress.  \"She means well, but is\nvery crusty and queer now, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh no--it isn't that!\" said Sue, trying to dry her eyes.  \"I don't\nmind her roughness one bit.\"\n\n\"What is it, then?\"\n\n\"It is that what she says is--is true!\"\n\n\"God--what--you don't like him?\" asked Jude.\n\n\"I don't mean that!\" she said hastily.  \"That I ought--perhaps I\nought not to have married!\"\n\nHe wondered if she had really been going to say that at first.\nThey went back, and the subject was smoothed over, and her aunt took\nrather kindly to Sue, telling her that not many young women newly\nmarried would have come so far to see a sick old crone like her.\nIn the afternoon Sue prepared to depart, Jude hiring a neighbour to\ndrive her to Alfredston.\n\n\"I'll go with you to the station, if you'd like?\" he said.\n\nShe would not let him.  The man came round with the trap, and Jude\nhelped her into it, perhaps with unnecessary attention, for she\nlooked at him prohibitively.\n\n\"I suppose--I may come to see you some day, when I am back again at\nMelchester?\" he half-crossly observed.\n\nShe bent down and said softly: \"No, dear--you are not to come yet.\nI don't think you are in a good mood.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Jude.  \"Good-bye!\"\n\n\"Good-bye!\" She waved her hand and was gone.\n\n\"She's right!  I won't go!\" he murmured.\n\nHe passed the evening and following days in mortifying by every\npossible means his wish to see her, nearly starving himself in\nattempts to extinguish by fasting his passionate tendency to love\nher.  He read sermons on discipline, and hunted up passages in Church\nhistory that treated of the Ascetics of the second century.  Before\nhe had returned from Marygreen to Melchester there arrived a letter\nfrom Arabella.  The sight of it revived a stronger feeling of\nself-condemnation for his brief return to her society than for his\nattachment to Sue.\n\nThe letter, he perceived, bore a London postmark instead of the\nChristminster one.  Arabella informed him that a few days after their\nparting in the morning at Christminster, she had been surprised by an\naffectionate letter from her Australian husband, formerly manager of\nthe hotel in Sydney.  He had come to England on purpose to find her;\nand had taken a free, fully-licensed public, in Lambeth, where he\nwished her to join him in conducting the business, which was likely\nto be a very thriving one, the house being situated in an excellent,\ndensely populated, gin-drinking neighbourhood, and already doing a\ntrade of \u00c2\u00a3200 a month, which could be easily doubled.\n\nAs he had said that he loved her very much still, and implored her to\ntell him where she was, and as they had only parted in a slight tiff,\nand as her engagement in Christminster was only temporary, she had\njust gone to join him as he urged.  She could not help feeling that\nshe belonged to him more than to Jude, since she had properly married\nhim, and had lived with him much longer than with her first husband.\nIn thus wishing Jude good-bye she bore him no ill-will, and trusted\nhe would not turn upon her, a weak woman, and inform against her,\nand bring her to ruin now that she had a chance of improving her\ncircumstances and leading a genteel life.\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nJude returned to Melchester, which had the questionable\nrecommendation of being only a dozen and a half miles from his Sue's\nnow permanent residence.  At first he felt that this nearness was a\ndistinct reason for not going southward at all; but Christminster\nwas too sad a place to bear, while the proximity of Shaston to\nMelchester might afford him the glory of worsting the Enemy in a\nclose engagement, such as was deliberately sought by the priests and\nvirgins of the early Church, who, disdaining an ignominious flight\nfrom temptation, became even chamber-partners with impunity.\nJude did not pause to remember that, in the laconic words of the\nhistorian, \"insulted Nature sometimes vindicated her rights\" in such\ncircumstances.\n\nHe now returned with feverish desperation to his study for the\npriesthood--in the recognition that the single-mindedness of his\naims, and his fidelity to the cause, had been more than questionable\nof late.  His passion for Sue troubled his soul; yet his lawful\nabandonment to the society of Arabella for twelve hours seemed\ninstinctively a worse thing--even though she had not told him of her\nSydney husband till afterwards.  He had, he verily believed, overcome\nall tendency to fly to liquor--which, indeed, he had never done from\ntaste, but merely as an escape from intolerable misery of mind.  Yet\nhe perceived with despondency that, taken all round, he was a man of\ntoo many passions to make a good clergyman; the utmost he could hope\nfor was that in a life of constant internal warfare between flesh and\nspirit the former might not always be victorious.\n\nAs a hobby, auxiliary to his readings in Divinity, he developed his\nslight skill in church-music and thorough-bass, till he could join in\npart-singing from notation with some accuracy.  A mile or two from\nMelchester there was a restored village church, to which Jude had\noriginally gone to fix the new columns and capitals.  By this means\nhe had become acquainted with the organist, and the ultimate result\nwas that he joined the choir as a bass voice.\n\nHe walked out to this parish twice every Sunday, and sometimes in the\nweek.  One evening about Easter the choir met for practice, and a new\nhymn which Jude had heard of as being by a Wessex composer was to be\ntried and prepared for the following week.  It turned out to be a\nstrangely emotional composition.  As they all sang it over and over\nagain its harmonies grew upon Jude, and moved him exceedingly.\n\nWhen they had finished he went round to the organist to make\ninquiries.  The score was in manuscript, the name of the composer\nbeing at the head, together with the title of the hymn: \"The Foot\nof the Cross.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the organist.  \"He is a local man.  He is a professional\nmusician at Kennetbridge--between here and Christminster.  The\nvicar knows him.  He was brought up and educated in Christminster\ntraditions, which accounts for the quality of the piece.  I think he\nplays in the large church there, and has a surpliced choir.  He comes\nto Melchester sometimes, and once tried to get the cathedral organ\nwhen the post was vacant.  The hymn is getting about everywhere this\nEaster.\"\n\nAs he walked humming the air on his way home, Jude fell to musing\non its composer, and the reasons why he composed it.  What a man of\nsympathies he must be!  Perplexed and harassed as he himself was\nabout Sue and Arabella, and troubled as was his conscience by the\ncomplication of his position, how he would like to know that man!\n\"He of all men would understand my difficulties,\" said the impulsive\nJude.  If there were any person in the world to choose as a\nconfidant, this composer would be the one, for he must have suffered,\nand throbbed, and yearned.\n\nIn brief, ill as he could afford the time and money for the journey,\nFawley resolved, like the child that he was, to go to Kennetbridge\nthe very next Sunday.  He duly started, early in the morning, for it\nwas only by a series of crooked railways that he could get to the\ntown.  About mid-day he reached it, and crossing the bridge into the\nquaint old borough he inquired for the house of the composer.\n\nThey told him it was a red brick building some little way further on.\nAlso that the gentleman himself had just passed along the street not\nfive minutes before.\n\n\"Which way?\" asked Jude with alacrity.\n\n\"Straight along homeward from church.\"\n\nJude hastened on, and soon had the pleasure of observing a man in a\nblack coat and a black slouched felt hat no considerable distance\nahead.  Stretching out his legs yet more widely, he stalked after.\n\"A hungry soul in pursuit of a full soul!\" he said.  \"I must speak\nto that man!\"\n\nHe could not, however, overtake the musician before he had entered\nhis own house, and then arose the question if this were an expedient\ntime to call.  Whether or not he decided to do so there and then, now\nthat he had got here, the distance home being too great for him to\nwait till late in the afternoon.  This man of soul would understand\nscant ceremony, and might be quite a perfect adviser in a case in\nwhich an earthly and illegitimate passion had cunningly obtained\nentrance into his heart through the opening afforded for religion.\n\nJude accordingly rang the bell, and was admitted.\n\nThe musician came to him in a moment, and being respectably dressed,\ngood-looking, and frank in manner, Jude obtained a favourable\nreception.  He was nevertheless conscious that there would be a\ncertain awkwardness in explaining his errand.\n\n\"I have been singing in the choir of a little church near\nMelchester,\" he said.  \"And we have this week practised 'The Foot\nof the Cross,' which I understand, sir, that you composed?\"\n\n\"I did--a year or so ago.\"\n\n\"I--like it.  I think it supremely beautiful!\"\n\n\"Ah well--other people have said so too.  Yes, there's money in\nit, if I could only see about getting it published.  I have other\ncompositions to go with it, too; I wish I could bring them out; for\nI haven't made a five-pound note out of any of them yet.  These\npublishing people--they want the copyright of an obscure composer's\nwork, such as mine is, for almost less than I should have to pay a\nperson for making a fair manuscript copy of the score.  The one you\nspeak of I have lent to various friends about here and Melchester,\nand so it has got to be sung a little.  But music is a poor staff to\nlean on--I am giving it up entirely.  You must go into trade if you\nwant to make money nowadays.  The wine business is what I am thinking\nof.  This is my forthcoming list--it is not issued yet--but you can\ntake one.\"\n\nHe handed Jude an advertisement list of several pages in booklet\nshape, ornamentally margined with a red line, in which were set forth\nthe various clarets, champagnes, ports, sherries, and other wines\nwith which he purposed to initiate his new venture.  It took Jude\nmore than by surprise that the man with the soul was thus and thus;\nand he felt that he could not open up his confidences.\n\nThey talked a little longer, but constrainedly, for when the musician\nfound that Jude was a poor man his manner changed from what it had\nbeen while Jude's appearance and address deceived him as to his\nposition and pursuits.  Jude stammered out something about his\nfeelings in wishing to congratulate the author on such an exalted\ncomposition, and took an embarrassed leave.\n\nAll the way home by the slow Sunday train, sitting in the fireless\nwaiting-rooms on this cold spring day, he was depressed enough at\nhis simplicity in taking such a journey.  But no sooner did he reach\nhis Melchester lodging than he found awaiting him a letter which had\narrived that morning a few minutes after he had left the house.  It\nwas a contrite little note from Sue, in which she said, with sweet\nhumility, that she felt she had been horrid in telling him he\nwas not to come to see her, that she despised herself for having\nbeen so conventional; and that he was to be sure to come by the\neleven-forty-five train that very Sunday, and have dinner with them\nat half-past one.\n\nJude almost tore his hair at having missed this letter till it was\ntoo late to act upon its contents; but he had chastened himself\nconsiderably of late, and at last his chimerical expedition\nto Kennetbridge really did seem to have been another special\nintervention of Providence to keep him away from temptation.  But a\ngrowing impatience of faith, which he had noticed in himself more\nthan once of late, made him pass over in ridicule the idea that God\nsent people on fools' errands.  He longed to see her; he was angry\nat having missed her: and he wrote instantly, telling her what had\nhappened, and saying he had not enough patience to wait till the\nfollowing Sunday, but would come any day in the week that she liked\nto name.\n\nSince he wrote a little over-ardently, Sue, as her manner was,\ndelayed her reply till Thursday before Good Friday, when she said he\nmight come that afternoon if he wished, this being the earliest day\non which she could welcome him, for she was now assistant-teacher in\nher husband's school.  Jude therefore got leave from the cathedral\nworks at the trifling expense of a stoppage of pay, and went.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart Fourth\n\n\nAT SHASTON\n\n\n\n   \"Whoso prefers either Matrimony or other Ordinance before\n    the Good of Man and the plain Exigence of Charity, let\n    him profess Papist, or Protestant, or what he will, he\n    is no better than a Pharisee.\"--J. MILTON.\n\n\nI\n\n\nShaston, the ancient British Palladour,\n\n     From whose foundation first such strange reports\n     arise,\n\n\n(as Drayton sang it), was, and is, in itself the city of a dream.\nVague imaginings of its castle, its three mints, its magnificent\napsidal abbey, the chief glory of South Wessex, its twelve churches,\nits shrines, chantries, hospitals, its gabled freestone mansions--all\nnow ruthlessly swept away--throw the visitor, even against his will,\ninto a pensive melancholy, which the stimulating atmosphere and\nlimitless landscape around him can scarcely dispel.  The spot was the\nburial-place of a king and a queen, of abbots and abbesses, saints\nand bishops, knights and squires.  The bones of King Edward \"the\nMartyr,\" carefully removed hither for holy preservation, brought\nShaston a renown which made it the resort of pilgrims from every part\nof Europe, and enabled it to maintain a reputation extending far\nbeyond English shores.  To this fair creation of the great Middle-Age\nthe Dissolution was, as historians tell us, the death-knell. With\nthe destruction of the enormous abbey the whole place collapsed in a\ngeneral ruin: the Martyr's bones met with the fate of the sacred pile\nthat held them, and not a stone is now left to tell where they lie.\n\nThe natural picturesqueness and singularity of the town still remain;\nbut strange to say these qualities, which were noted by many writers\nin ages when scenic beauty is said to have been unappreciated, are\npassed over in this, and one of the queerest and quaintest spots in\nEngland stands virtually unvisited to-day.\n\nIt has a unique position on the summit of a steep and imposing scarp,\nrising on the north, south, and west sides of the borough out of\nthe deep alluvial Vale of Blackmoor, the view from the Castle Green\nover three counties of verdant pasture--South, Mid, and Nether\nWessex--being as sudden a surprise to the unexpectant traveller's\neyes as the medicinal air is to his lungs.  Impossible to a railway,\nit can best be reached on foot, next best by light vehicles; and\nit is hardly accessible to these but by a sort of isthmus on the\nnorth-east, that connects it with the high chalk table-land on that\nside.\n\nSuch is, and such was, the now world-forgotten Shaston or Palladour.\nIts situation rendered water the great want of the town; and within\nliving memory, horses, donkeys and men may have been seen toiling\nup the winding ways to the top of the height, laden with tubs and\nbarrels filled from the wells beneath the mountain, and hawkers\nretailing their contents at the price of a halfpenny a bucketful.\n\nThis difficulty in the water supply, together with two other odd\nfacts, namely, that the chief graveyard slopes up as steeply as a\nroof behind the church, and that in former times the town passed\nthrough a curious period of corruption, conventual and domestic, gave\nrise to the saying that Shaston was remarkable for three consolations\nto man, such as the world afforded not elsewhere.  It was a place\nwhere the churchyard lay nearer heaven than the church steeple, where\nbeer was more plentiful than water, and where there were more wanton\nwomen than honest wives and maids.  It is also said that after the\nMiddle Ages the inhabitants were too poor to pay their priests,\nand hence were compelled to pull down their churches, and refrain\naltogether from the public worship of God; a necessity which they\nbemoaned over their cups in the settles of their inns on Sunday\nafternoons.  In those days the Shastonians were apparently not\nwithout a sense of humour.\n\nThere was another peculiarity--this a modern one--which Shaston\nappeared to owe to its site.  It was the resting-place and\nheadquarters of the proprietors of wandering vans, shows,\nshooting-galleries, and other itinerant concerns, whose business\nlay largely at fairs and markets.  As strange wild birds are seen\nassembled on some lofty promontory, meditatively pausing for longer\nflights, or to return by the course they followed thither, so here,\nin this cliff-town, stood in stultified silence the yellow and green\ncaravans bearing names not local, as if surprised by a change in the\nlandscape so violent as to hinder their further progress; and here\nthey usually remained all the winter till they turned to seek again\ntheir old tracks in the following spring.\n\nIt was to this breezy and whimsical spot that Jude ascended from the\nnearest station for the first time in his life about four o'clock one\nafternoon, and entering on the summit of the peak after a toilsome\nclimb, passed the first houses of the aerial town; and drew towards\nthe school-house.  The hour was too early; the pupils were still in\nschool, humming small, like a swarm of gnats; and he withdrew a few\nsteps along Abbey Walk, whence he regarded the spot which fate had\nmade the home of all he loved best in the world.  In front of the\nschools, which were extensive and stone-built, grew two enormous\nbeeches with smooth mouse-coloured trunks, as such trees will only\ngrow on chalk uplands.  Within the mullioned and transomed windows he\ncould see the black, brown, and flaxen crowns of the scholars over\nthe sills, and to pass the time away he walked down to the level\nterrace where the abbey gardens once had spread, his heart throbbing\nin spite of him.\n\nUnwilling to enter till the children were dismissed he remained here\ntill young voices could be heard in the open air, and girls in white\npinafores over red and blue frocks appeared dancing along the paths\nwhich the abbess, prioress, subprioress, and fifty nuns had demurely\npaced three centuries earlier.  Retracing his steps he found that he\nhad waited too long, and that Sue had gone out into the town at the\nheels of the last scholar, Mr. Phillotson having been absent all the\nafternoon at a teachers' meeting at Shottsford.\n\nJude went into the empty schoolroom and sat down, the girl who was\nsweeping the floor having informed him that Mrs. Phillotson would be\nback again in a few minutes.  A piano stood near--actually the old\npiano that Phillotson had possessed at Marygreen--and though the dark\nafternoon almost prevented him seeing the notes Jude touched them in\nhis humble way, and could not help modulating into the hymn which had\nso affected him in the previous week.\n\nA figure moved behind him, and thinking it was still the girl with\nthe broom Jude took no notice, till the person came close and laid\nher fingers lightly upon his bass hand.  The imposed hand was a\nlittle one he seemed to know, and he turned.\n\n\"Don't stop,\" said Sue.  \"I like it.  I learnt it before I left\nMelchester.  They used to play it in the training school.\"\n\n\"I can't strum before you!  Play it for me.\"\n\n\"Oh well--I don't mind.\"\n\nSue sat down, and her rendering of the piece, though not remarkable,\nseemed divine as compared with his own.  She, like him, was evidently\ntouched--to her own surprise--by the recalled air; and when she\nhad finished, and he moved his hand towards hers, it met his own\nhalf-way. Jude grasped it--just as he had done before her marriage.\n\n\"It is odd,\" she said, in a voice quite changed, \"that I should care\nabout that air; because--\"\n\n\"Because what?\"\n\n\"I am not that sort--quite.\"\n\n\"Not easily moved?\"\n\n\"I didn't quite mean that.\"\n\n\"Oh, but you ARE one of that sort, for you are just like me at\nheart!\"\n\n\"But not at head.\"\n\nShe played on and suddenly turned round; and by an unpremeditated\ninstinct each clasped the other's hand again.\n\nShe uttered a forced little laugh as she relinquished his quickly.\n\"How funny!\" she said.  \"I wonder what we both did that for?\"\n\n\"I suppose because we are both alike, as I said before.\"\n\n\"Not in our thoughts!  Perhaps a little in our feelings.\"\n\n\"And they rule thoughts...  Isn't it enough to make one blaspheme\nthat the composer of that hymn is one of the most commonplace men I\never met!\"\n\n\"What--you know him?\"\n\n\"I went to see him.\"\n\n\"Oh, you goose--to do just what I should have done!  Why did you?\"\n\n\"Because we are not alike,\" he said drily.\n\n\"Now we'll have some tea,\" said Sue.  \"Shall we have it here instead\nof in my house?  It is no trouble to get the kettle and things\nbrought in.  We don't live at the school you know, but in that\nancient dwelling across the way called Old-Grove Place.  It is so\nantique and dismal that it depresses me dreadfully.  Such houses are\nvery well to visit, but not to live in--I feel crushed into the earth\nby the weight of so many previous lives there spent.  In a new place\nlike these schools there is only your own life to support.  Sit down,\nand I'll tell Ada to bring the tea-things across.\"\n\nHe waited in the light of the stove, the door of which she flung open\nbefore going out, and when she returned, followed by the maiden with\ntea, they sat down by the same light, assisted by the blue rays of a\nspirit-lamp under the brass kettle on the stand.\n\n\"This is one of your wedding-presents to me,\" she said, signifying\nthe latter.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jude.\n\nThe kettle of his gift sang with some satire in its note, to his\nmind; and to change the subject he said, \"Do you know of any good\nreadable edition of the uncanonical books of the New Testament?  You\ndon't read them in the school I suppose?\"\n\n\"Oh dear no!--'twould alarm the neighbourhood...  Yes, there is one.\nI am not familiar with it now, though I was interested in it when my\nformer friend was alive.  Cowper's _Apocryphal Gospels_.\"\n\n\"That sounds like what I want.\"  His thoughts, however reverted with\na twinge to the \"former friend\"--by whom she meant, as he knew, the\nuniversity comrade of her earlier days.  He wondered if she talked of\nhim to Phillotson.\n\n\"The Gospel of Nicodemus is very nice,\" she went on to keep him from\nhis jealous thoughts, which she read clearly, as she always did.\nIndeed when they talked on an indifferent subject, as now, there was\never a second silent conversation passing between their emotions,\nso perfect was the reciprocity between them.  \"It is quite like the\ngenuine article.  All cut up into verses, too; so that it is like\none of the other evangelists read in a dream, when things are the\nsame, yet not the same.  But, Jude, do you take an interest in those\nquestions still?  Are you getting up _Apologetica_?\"\n\n\"Yes.  I am reading Divinity harder than ever.\"\n\nShe regarded him curiously.\n\n\"Why do you look at me like that?\" said Jude.\n\n\"Oh--why do you want to know?\"\n\n\"I am sure you can tell me anything I may be ignorant of in that\nsubject.  You must have learnt a lot of everything from your dear\ndead friend!\"\n\n\"We won't get on to that now!\" she coaxed.  \"Will you be carving out\nat that church again next week, where you learnt the pretty hymn?\"\n\n\"Yes, perhaps.\"\n\n\"That will be very nice.  Shall I come and see you there?  It is in\nthis direction, and I could come any afternoon by train for half an\nhour?\"\n\n\"No. Don't come!\"\n\n\"What--aren't we going to be friends, then, any longer, as we used to\nbe?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I didn't know that.  I thought you were always going to be kind to\nme!\"\n\n\"No, I am not.\"\n\n\"What have I done, then?  I am sure I thought we two--\"  The\n_tremolo_ in her voice caused her to break off.\n\n\"Sue, I sometimes think you are a flirt,\" said he abruptly.\n\nThere was a momentary pause, till she suddenly jumped up; and to his\nsurprise he saw by the kettle-flame that her face was flushed.\n\n\"I can't talk to you any longer, Jude!\" she said, the tragic\ncontralto note having come back as of old.  \"It is getting too dark\nto stay together like this, after playing morbid Good Friday tunes\nthat make one feel what one shouldn't! ...  We mustn't sit and talk\nin this way any more.  Yes--you must go away, for you mistake me!  I\nam very much the reverse of what you say so cruelly--Oh, Jude, it WAS\ncruel to say that!  Yet I can't tell you the truth--I should shock\nyou by letting you know how I give way to my impulses, and how much I\nfeel that I shouldn't have been provided with attractiveness unless\nit were meant to be exercised!  Some women's love of being loved is\ninsatiable; and so, often, is their love of loving; and in the last\ncase they may find that they can't give it continuously to the\nchamber-officer appointed by the bishop's licence to receive it.\nBut you are so straightforward, Jude, that you can't understand\nme! ...  Now you must go. I am sorry my husband is not at home.\"\n\n\"Are you?\"\n\n\"I perceive I have said that in mere convention!  Honestly I don't\nthink I am sorry.  It does not matter, either way, sad to say!\"\n\nAs they had overdone the grasp of hands some time sooner, she touched\nhis fingers but lightly when he went out now.  He had hardly gone\nfrom the door when, with a dissatisfied look, she jumped on a form\nand opened the iron casement of a window beneath which he was passing\nin the path without.  \"When do you leave here to catch your train,\nJude?\" she asked.\n\nHe looked up in some surprise.  \"The coach that runs to meet it goes\nin three-quarters of an hour or so.\"\n\n\"What will you do with yourself for the time?\"\n\n\"Oh--wander about, I suppose.  Perhaps I shall go and sit in the old\nchurch.\"\n\n\"It does seem hard of me to pack you off so!  You have thought enough\nof churches, Heaven knows, without going into one in the dark. Stay\nthere.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Where you are.  I can talk to you better like this than when you\nwere inside...  It was so kind and tender of you to give up half\na day's work to come to see me! ...  You are Joseph the dreamer of\ndreams, dear Jude.  And a tragic Don Quixote.  And sometimes you\nare St. Stephen, who, while they were stoning him, could see Heaven\nopened.  Oh, my poor friend and comrade, you'll suffer yet!\"\n\nNow that the high window-sill was between them, so that he could not\nget at her, she seemed not to mind indulging in a frankness she had\nfeared at close quarters.\n\n\"I have been thinking,\" she continued, still in the tone of one\nbrimful of feeling, \"that the social moulds civilization fits us into\nhave no more relation to our actual shapes than the conventional\nshapes of the constellations have to the real star-patterns.  I\nam called Mrs. Richard Phillotson, living a calm wedded life with\nmy counterpart of that name.  But I am not really Mrs. Richard\nPhillotson, but a woman tossed about, all alone, with aberrant\npassions, and unaccountable antipathies...  Now you mustn't wait\nlonger, or you will lose the coach.  Come and see me again.  You\nmust come to the house then.\"\n\n\"Yes!\" said Jude.  \"When shall it be?\"\n\n\"To-morrow week.  Good-bye--good-bye!\"  She stretched out her hand\nand stroked his forehead pitifully--just once.  Jude said good-bye,\nand went away into the darkness.\n\nPassing along Bimport Street he thought he heard the wheels of the\ncoach departing, and, truly enough, when he reached the Duke's Arms\nin the Market Place the coach had gone.  It was impossible for him\nto get to the station on foot in time for this train, and he settled\nhimself perforce to wait for the next--the last to Melchester that\nnight.\n\nHe wandered about awhile, obtained something to eat; and then, having\nanother half-hour on his hands, his feet involuntarily took him\nthrough the venerable graveyard of Trinity Church, with its avenues\nof limes, in the direction of the schools again.  They were entirely\nin darkness.  She had said she lived over the way at Old-Grove\nPlace, a house which he soon discovered from her description of its\nantiquity.\n\nA glimmering candlelight shone from a front window, the shutters\nbeing yet unclosed.  He could see the interior clearly--the floor\nsinking a couple of steps below the road without, which had become\nraised during the centuries since the house was built.  Sue,\nevidently just come in, was standing with her hat on in this front\nparlour or sitting-room, whose walls were lined with wainscoting\nof panelled oak reaching from floor to ceiling, the latter being\ncrossed by huge moulded beams only a little way above her head.  The\nmantelpiece was of the same heavy description, carved with Jacobean\npilasters and scroll-work.  The centuries did, indeed, ponderously\noverhang a young wife who passed her time here.\n\nShe had opened a rosewood work-box, and was looking at a photograph.\nHaving contemplated it a little while she pressed it against her\nbosom, and put it again in its place.\n\nThen becoming aware that she had not obscured the windows she came\nforward to do so, candle in hand.  It was too dark for her to see\nJude without, but he could see her face distinctly, and there was an\nunmistakable tearfulness about the dark, long-lashed eyes.\n\nShe closed the shutters, and Jude turned away to pursue his solitary\njourney home.  \"Whose photograph was she looking at?\" he said.  He\nhad once given her his; but she had others, he knew.  Yet it was his,\nsurely?\n\nHe knew he should go to see her again, according to her invitation.\nThose earnest men he read of, the saints, whom Sue, with gentle\nirreverence, called his demi-gods, would have shunned such encounters\nif they doubted their own strength.  But he could not.  He might fast\nand pray during the whole interval, but the human was more powerful\nin him than the Divine.\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nHowever, if God disposed not, woman did.  The next morning but one\nbrought him this note from her:\n\n\n   Don't come next week.  On your own account don't!  We were\n   too free, under the influence of that morbid hymn and the\n   twilight.  Think no more than you can help of\n\n   SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY.\n\n\nThe disappointment was keen.  He knew her mood, the look of her face,\nwhen she subscribed herself at length thus.  But, whatever her mood, he\ncould not say she was wrong in her view. He replied:\n\n\n   I acquiesce.  You are right.  It is a lesson in\n   renunciation which I suppose I ought to learn at this\n   season.\n\n   JUDE.\n\n\nHe despatched the note on Easter Eve, and there seemed a finality\nin their decisions.  But other forces and laws than theirs were in\noperation.  On Easter Monday morning he received a message from the\nWidow Edlin, whom he had directed to telegraph if anything serious\nhappened:\n\n\n   Your aunt is sinking.  Come at once.\n\n\nHe threw down his tools and went.  Three and a half hours later he\nwas crossing the downs about Marygreen, and presently plunged into\nthe concave field across which the short cut was made to the village.\nAs he ascended on the other side a labouring man, who had been\nwatching his approach from a gate across the path, moved uneasily,\nand prepared to speak.  \"I can see in his face that she is dead,\"\nsaid Jude.  \"Poor Aunt Drusilla!\"\n\nIt was as he had supposed, and Mrs. Edlin had sent out the man to\nbreak the news to him.\n\n\"She wouldn't have knowed 'ee.  She lay like a doll wi' glass eyes;\nso it didn't matter that you wasn't here,\" said he.\n\nJude went on to the house, and in the afternoon, when everything was\ndone, and the layers-out had finished their beer, and gone, he sat\ndown alone in the silent place.  It was absolutely necessary to\ncommunicate with Sue, though two or three days earlier they had\nagreed to mutual severance.  He wrote in the briefest terms:\n\n\n   Aunt Drusilla is dead, having been taken almost suddenly.\n   The funeral is on Friday afternoon.\n\n\nHe remained in and about Marygreen through the intervening days,\nwent out on Friday morning to see that the grave was finished, and\nwondered if Sue would come.  She had not written, and that seemed to\nsignify rather that she would come than that she would not.  Having\ntimed her by her only possible train, he locked the door about\nmid-day, and crossed the hollow field to the verge of the upland by\nthe Brown House, where he stood and looked over the vast prospect\nnorthwards, and over the nearer landscape in which Alfredston stood.\nTwo miles behind it a jet of white steam was travelling from the left\nto the right of the picture.\n\nThere was a long time to wait, even now, till he would know if she\nhad arrived.  He did wait, however, and at last a small hired vehicle\npulled up at the bottom of the hill, and a person alighted, the\nconveyance going back, while the passenger began ascending the\nhill.  He knew her; and she looked so slender to-day that it seemed\nas if she might be crushed in the intensity of a too passionate\nembrace--such as it was not for him to give.  Two-thirds of the way\nup her head suddenly took a solicitous poise, and he knew that she\nhad at that moment recognized him.  Her face soon began a pensive\nsmile, which lasted till, having descended a little way, he met her.\n\n\"I thought,\" she began with nervous quickness, \"that it would be\nso sad to let you attend the funeral alone!  And so--at the last\nmoment--I came.\"\n\n\"Dear faithful Sue!\" murmured Jude.\n\nWith the elusiveness of her curious double nature, however, Sue did\nnot stand still for any further greeting, though it wanted some\ntime to the burial.  A pathos so unusually compounded as that which\nattached to this hour was unlikely to repeat itself for years, if\never, and Jude would have paused, and meditated, and conversed.  But\nSue either saw it not at all, or, seeing it more than he, would not\nallow herself to feel it.\n\nThe sad and simple ceremony was soon over, their progress to the\nchurch being almost at a trot, the bustling undertaker having a more\nimportant funeral an hour later, three miles off.  Drusilla was put\ninto the new ground, quite away from her ancestors.  Sue and Jude\nhad gone side by side to the grave, and now sat down to tea in the\nfamiliar house; their lives united at least in this last attention\nto the dead.\n\n\"She was opposed to marriage, from first to last, you say?\" murmured\nSue.\n\n\"Yes.  Particularly for members of our family.\"\n\nHer eyes met his, and remained on him awhile.\n\n\"We are rather a sad family, don't you think, Jude?\"\n\n\"She said we made bad husbands and wives.  Certainly we make unhappy\nones.  At all events, I do, for one!\"\n\nSue was silent.  \"Is it wrong, Jude,\" she said with a tentative\ntremor, \"for a husband or wife to tell a third person that they are\nunhappy in their marriage?  If a marriage ceremony is a religious\nthing, it is possibly wrong; but if it is only a sordid contract,\nbased on material convenience in householding, rating, and taxing,\nand the inheritance of land and money by children, making it\nnecessary that the male parent should be known--which it seems to\nbe--why surely a person may say, even proclaim upon the housetops,\nthat it hurts and grieves him or her?\"\n\n\"I have said so, anyhow, to you.\"\n\nPresently she went on: \"Are there many couples, do you think, where\none dislikes the other for no definite fault?\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose.  If either cares for another person, for instance.\"\n\n\"But even apart from that?  Wouldn't the woman, for example, be very\nbad-natured if she didn't like to live with her husband; merely\"--her\nvoice undulated, and he guessed things--\"merely because she had a\npersonal feeling against it--a physical objection--a fastidiousness,\nor whatever it may be called--although she might respect and be\ngrateful to him?  I am merely putting a case.  Ought she to try to\novercome her pruderies?\"\n\nJude threw a troubled look at her.  He said, looking away: \"It would\nbe just one of those cases in which my experiences go contrary to my\ndogmas.  Speaking as an order-loving man--which I hope I am, though\nI fear I am not--I should say, yes.  Speaking from experience and\nunbiased nature, I should say, no....  Sue, I believe you are not\nhappy!\"\n\n\"Of course I am!\" she contradicted.  \"How can a woman be unhappy who\nhas only been married eight weeks to a man she chose freely?\"\n\n\"'Chose freely!'\"\n\n\"Why do you repeat it? ...  But I have to go back by the six o'clock\ntrain.  You will be staying on here, I suppose?\"\n\n\"For a few days to wind up Aunt's affairs.  This house is gone now.\nShall I go to the train with you?\"\n\nA little laugh of objection came from Sue.  \"I think not.  You may\ncome part of the way.\"\n\n\"But stop--you can't go to-night!  That train won't take you to\nShaston.  You must stay and go back to-morrow.  Mrs. Edlin has plenty\nof room, if you don't like to stay here?\"\n\n\"Very well,\" she said dubiously.  \"I didn't tell him I would come for\ncertain.\"\n\nJude went to the widow's house adjoining, to let her know; and\nreturning in a few minutes sat down again.\n\n\"It is horrible how we are circumstanced, Sue--horrible!\" he said\nabruptly, with his eyes bent to the floor.\n\n\"No!  Why?\"\n\n\"I can't tell you all my part of the gloom.  Your part is that you\nought not to have married him.  I saw it before you had done it, but\nI thought I mustn't interfere.  I was wrong.  I ought to have!\"\n\n\"But what makes you assume all this, dear?\"\n\n\"Because--I can see you through your feathers, my poor little bird!\"\n\nHer hand lay on the table, and Jude put his upon it.  Sue drew hers\naway.\n\n\"That's absurd, Sue,\" cried he, \"after what we've been talking about!\nI am more strict and formal than you, if it comes to that; and that\nyou should object to such an innocent action shows that you are\nridiculously inconsistent!\"\n\n\"Perhaps it was too prudish,\" she said repentantly.  \"Only I have\nfancied it was a sort of trick of ours--too frequent perhaps.  There,\nyou may hold it as much as you like. Is that good of me?\"\n\n\"Yes; very.\"\n\n\"But I must tell him.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Richard.\"\n\n\"Oh--of course, if you think it necessary.  But as it means nothing\nit may be bothering him needlessly.\"\n\n\"Well--are you sure you mean it only as my cousin?\"\n\n\"Absolutely sure.  I have no feelings of love left in me.\"\n\n\"That's news.  How has it come to be?\"\n\n\"I've seen Arabella.\"\n\nShe winced at the hit; then said curiously, \"When did you see her?\"\n\n\"When I was at Christminster.\"\n\n\"So she's come back; and you never told me!  I suppose you will live\nwith her now?\"\n\n\"Of course--just as you live with your husband.\"\n\nShe looked at the window pots with the geraniums and cactuses,\nwithered for want of attention, and through them at the outer\ndistance, till her eyes began to grow moist.  \"What is it?\" said\nJude, in a softened tone.\n\n\"Why should you be so glad to go back to her if--if what you used to\nsay to me is still true--I mean if it were true then!  Of course it\nis not now!  How could your heart go back to Arabella so soon?\"\n\n\"A special Providence, I suppose, helped it on its way.\"\n\n\"Ah--it isn't true!\" she said with gentle resentment.  \"You are\nteasing me--that's all--because you think I am not happy!\"\n\n\"I don't know.  I don't wish to know.\"\n\n\"If I were unhappy it would be my fault, my wickedness; not that\nI should have a right to dislike him!  He is considerate to me in\neverything; and he is very interesting, from the amount of general\nknowledge he has acquired by reading everything that comes in his\nway....  Do you think, Jude, that a man ought to marry a woman his\nown age, or one younger than himself--eighteen years--as I am than\nhe?\"\n\n\"It depends upon what they feel for each other.\"\n\nHe gave her no opportunity of self-satisfaction, and she had to go on\nunaided, which she did in a vanquished tone, verging on tears:\n\n\"I--I think I must be equally honest with you as you have been with\nme.  Perhaps you have seen what it is I want to say?--that though I\nlike Mr. Phillotson as a friend, I don't like him--it is a torture to\nme to--live with him as a husband!--There, now I have let it out--I\ncouldn't help it, although I have been--pretending I am happy.--Now\nyou'll have a contempt for me for ever, I suppose!\"  She bent down\nher face upon her hands as they lay upon the cloth, and silently\nsobbed in little jerks that made the fragile three-legged table\nquiver.\n\n\"I have only been married a month or two!\" she went on, still\nremaining bent upon the table, and sobbing into her hands.  \"And it\nis said that what a woman shrinks from--in the early days of her\nmarriage--she shakes down to with comfortable indifference in half a\ndozen years.  But that is much like saying that the amputation of a\nlimb is no affliction, since a person gets comfortably accustomed to\nthe use of a wooden leg or arm in the course of time!\"\n\nJude could hardly speak, but he said, \"I thought there was something\nwrong, Sue!  Oh, I thought there was!\"\n\n\"But it is not as you think!--there is nothing wrong except my own\nwickedness, I suppose you'd call it--a repugnance on my part, for a\nreason I cannot disclose, and what would not be admitted as one by\nthe world in general! ...  What tortures me so much is the necessity\nof being responsive to this man whenever he wishes, good as he is\nmorally!--the dreadful contract to feel in a particular way in a\nmatter whose essence is its voluntariness! ...  I wish he would beat\nme, or be faithless to me, or do some open thing that I could talk\nabout as a justification for feeling as I do!  But he does nothing,\nexcept that he has grown a little cold since he has found out how I\nfeel.  That's why he didn't come to the funeral...  Oh, I am very\nmiserable--I don't know what to do! ...  Don't come near me, Jude,\nbecause you mustn't.  Don't--don't!\"\n\nBut he had jumped up and put his face against hers--or rather against\nher ear, her face being inaccessible.\n\n\"I told you not to, Jude!\"\n\n\"I know you did--I only wish to--console you!  It all arose through\nmy being married before we met, didn't it?  You would have been my\nwife, Sue, wouldn't you, if it hadn't been for that?\"\n\nInstead of replying she rose quickly, and saying she was going to\nwalk to her aunt's grave in the churchyard to recover herself, went\nout of the house.  Jude did not follow her.  Twenty minutes later he\nsaw her cross the village green towards Mrs. Edlin's, and soon she\nsent a little girl to fetch her bag, and tell him she was too tired\nto see him again that night.\n\nIn the lonely room of his aunt's house, Jude sat watching the\ncottage of the Widow Edlin as it disappeared behind the night shade.\nHe knew that Sue was sitting within its walls equally lonely and\ndisheartened; and again questioned his devotional motto that all was\nfor the best.\n\nHe retired to rest early, but his sleep was fitful from the sense\nthat Sue was so near at hand.  At some time near two o'clock, when\nhe was beginning to sleep more soundly, he was aroused by a shrill\nsqueak that had been familiar enough to him when he lived regularly\nat Marygreen.  It was the cry of a rabbit caught in a gin.  As was\nthe little creature's habit, it did not soon repeat its cry; and\nprobably would not do so more than once or twice; but would remain\nbearing its torture till the morrow when the trapper would come and\nknock it on the head.\n\nHe who in his childhood had saved the lives of the earthworms now\nbegan to picture the agonies of the rabbit from its lacerated leg.\nIf it were a \"bad catch\" by the hind-leg, the animal would tug\nduring the ensuing six hours till the iron teeth of the trap had\nstripped the leg-bone of its flesh, when, should a weak-springed\ninstrument enable it to escape, it would die in the fields from the\nmortification of the limb.  If it were a \"good catch,\" namely, by the\nfore-leg, the bone would be broken and the limb nearly torn in two in\nattempts at an impossible escape.\n\nAlmost half an hour passed, and the rabbit repeated its cry.  Jude\ncould rest no longer till he had put it out of its pain, so dressing\nhimself quickly he descended, and by the light of the moon went\nacross the green in the direction of the sound.  He reached the hedge\nbordering the widow's garden, when he stood still.  The faint click\nof the trap as dragged about by the writhing animal guided him now,\nand reaching the spot he struck the rabbit on the back of the neck\nwith the side of his palm, and it stretched itself out dead.\n\nHe was turning away when he saw a woman looking out of the open\ncasement at a window on the ground floor of the adjacent cottage.\n\"Jude!\" said a voice timidly--Sue's voice.  \"It is you--is it not?\"\n\n\"Yes, dear!\"\n\n\"I haven't been able to sleep at all, and then I heard the rabbit,\nand couldn't help thinking of what it suffered, till I felt I must\ncome down and kill it!  But I am so glad you got there first...  They\nought not to be allowed to set these steel traps, ought they!\"\n\nJude had reached the window, which was quite a low one, so that she\nwas visible down to her waist.  She let go the casement-stay and put\nher hand upon his, her moonlit face regarding him wistfully.\n\n\"Did it keep you awake?\" he said.\n\n\"No--I was awake.\"\n\n\"How was that?\"\n\n\"Oh, you know--now!  I know you, with your religious doctrines, think\nthat a married woman in trouble of a kind like mine commits a mortal\nsin in making a man the confidant of it, as I did you.  I wish I\nhadn't, now!\"\n\n\"Don't wish it, dear,\" he said.  \"That may have BEEN my view; but my\ndoctrines and I begin to part company.\"\n\n\"I knew it--I knew it!  And that's why I vowed I wouldn't disturb\nyour belief.  But--I am SO GLAD to see you!--and, oh, I didn't mean\nto see you again, now the last tie between us, Aunt Drusilla, is\ndead!\"\n\nJude seized her hand and kissed it.  \"There is a stronger one left!\"\nhe said.  \"I'll never care about my doctrines or my religion any\nmore!  Let them go!  Let me help you, even if I do love you, and even\nif you...\"\n\n\"Don't say it!--I know what you mean; but I can't admit so much as\nthat.  There!  Guess what you like, but don't press me to answer\nquestions!\"\n\n\"I wish you were happy, whatever I may be!\"\n\n\"I CAN'T be!  So few could enter into my feeling--they would say\n'twas my fanciful fastidiousness, or something of that sort, and\ncondemn me...  It is none of the natural tragedies of love that's\nlove's usual tragedy in civilized life, but a tragedy artificially\nmanufactured for people who in a natural state would find relief in\nparting! ...  It would have been wrong, perhaps, for me to tell my\ndistress to you, if I had been able to tell it to anybody else.  But\nI have nobody.  And I MUST tell somebody!  Jude, before I married\nhim I had never thought out fully what marriage meant, even though I\nknew.  It was idiotic of me--there is no excuse.  I was old enough,\nand I thought I was very experienced.  So I rushed on, when I had got\ninto that training school scrape, with all the cock-sureness of the\nfool that I was! ...  I am certain one ought to be allowed to undo\nwhat one had done so ignorantly!  I daresay it happens to lots of\nwomen, only they submit, and I kick...  When people of a later age\nlook back upon the barbarous customs and superstitions of the times\nthat we have the unhappiness to live in, what WILL they say!\"\n\n\"You are very bitter, darling Sue!  How I wish--I wish--\"\n\n\"You must go in now!\"\n\nIn a moment of impulse she bent over the sill, and laid her face upon\nhis hair, weeping, and then imprinting a scarcely perceptible little\nkiss upon the top of his head, withdrawing quickly, so that he could\nnot put his arms round her, as otherwise he unquestionably would have\ndone.  She shut the casement, and he returned to his cottage.\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nSue's distressful confession recurred to Jude's mind all the night as\nbeing a sorrow indeed.\n\nThe morning after, when it was time for her to go, the neighbours saw\nher companion and herself disappearing on foot down the hill path\nwhich led into the lonely road to Alfredston.  An hour passed before\nhe returned along the same route, and in his face there was a look of\nexaltation not unmixed with recklessness.  An incident had occurred.\n\nThey had stood parting in the silent highway, and their tense and\npassionate moods had led to bewildered inquiries of each other on how\nfar their intimacy ought to go; till they had almost quarrelled, and\nshe said tearfully that it was hardly proper of him as a parson in\nembryo to think of such a thing as kissing her even in farewell as he\nnow wished to do.  Then she had conceded that the fact of the kiss\nwould be nothing: all would depend upon the spirit of it.  If given\nin the spirit of a cousin and a friend she saw no objection: if in\nthe spirit of a lover she could not permit it.  \"Will you swear that\nit will not be in that spirit?\" she had said.\n\nNo: he would not.  And then they had turned from each other in\nestrangement, and gone their several ways, till at a distance\nof twenty or thirty yards both had looked round simultaneously.\nThat look behind was fatal to the reserve hitherto more or less\nmaintained.  They had quickly run back, and met, and embracing most\nunpremeditatedly, kissed close and long.  When they parted for good\nit was with flushed cheeks on her side, and a beating heart on his.\n\nThe kiss was a turning-point in Jude's career.  Back again in the\ncottage, and left to reflection, he saw one thing: that though\nhis kiss of that aerial being had seemed the purest moment of his\nfaultful life, as long as he nourished this unlicensed tenderness it\nwas glaringly inconsistent for him to pursue the idea of becoming the\nsoldier and servant of a religion in which sexual love was regarded\nas at its best a frailty, and at its worst damnation.  What Sue\nhad said in warmth was really the cold truth.  When to defend\nhis affection tooth and nail, to persist with headlong force in\nimpassioned attentions to her, was all he thought of, he was\ncondemned _ipso facto_ as a professor of the accepted school of\nmorals.  He was as unfit, obviously, by nature, as he had been by\nsocial position, to fill the part of a propounder of accredited\ndogma.\n\nStrange that his first aspiration--towards academical\nproficiency--had been checked by a woman, and that his second\naspiration--towards apostleship--had also been checked by a woman.\n\"Is it,\" he said, \"that the women are to blame; or is it the\nartificial system of things, under which the normal sex-impulses are\nturned into devilish domestic gins and springs to noose and hold back\nthose who want to progress?\"\n\nIt had been his standing desire to become a prophet, however humble,\nto his struggling fellow-creatures, without any thought of personal\ngain.  Yet with a wife living away from him with another husband, and\nhimself in love erratically, the loved one's revolt against her state\nbeing possibly on his account, he had sunk to be barely respectable\naccording to regulation views.\n\nIt was not for him to consider further: he had only to confront the\nobvious, which was that he had made himself quite an impostor as a\nlaw-abiding religious teacher.\n\nAt dusk that evening he went into the garden and dug a shallow hole,\nto which he brought out all the theological and ethical works that\nhe possessed, and had stored here.  He knew that, in this country of\ntrue believers, most of them were not saleable at a much higher price\nthan waste-paper value, and preferred to get rid of them in his own\nway, even if he should sacrifice a little money to the sentiment of\nthus destroying them.  Lighting some loose pamphlets to begin with,\nhe cut the volumes into pieces as well as he could, and with a\nthree-pronged fork shook them over the flames.  They kindled, and\nlighted up the back of the house, the pigsty, and his own face, till\nthey were more or less consumed.\n\nThough he was almost a stranger here now, passing cottagers talked to\nhim over the garden hedge.\n\n\"Burning up your awld aunt's rubbidge, I suppose?  Ay; a lot gets\nheaped up in nooks and corners when you've lived eighty years in one\nhouse.\"\n\nIt was nearly one o'clock in the morning before the leaves, covers,\nand binding of Jeremy Taylor, Butler, Doddridge, Paley, Pusey, Newman\nand the rest had gone to ashes, but the night was quiet, and as he\nturned and turned the paper shreds with the fork, the sense of being\nno longer a hypocrite to himself afforded his mind a relief which\ngave him calm.  He might go on believing as before, but he professed\nnothing, and no longer owned and exhibited engines of faith which,\nas their proprietor, he might naturally be supposed to exercise on\nhimself first of all.  In his passion for Sue he could not stand as\nan ordinary sinner, and not as a whited sepulchre.\n\nMeanwhile Sue, after parting from him earlier in the day, had gone\nalong to the station, with tears in her eyes for having run back and\nlet him kiss her.  Jude ought not to have pretended that he was not a\nlover, and made her give way to an impulse to act unconventionally,\nif not wrongly.  She was inclined to call it the latter; for Sue's\nlogic was extraordinarily compounded, and seemed to maintain that\nbefore a thing was done it might be right to do, but that being done\nit became wrong; or, in other words, that things which were right in\ntheory were wrong in practice.\n\n\"I have been too weak, I think!\" she jerked out as she pranced on,\nshaking down tear-drops now and then.  \"It was burning, like a\nlover's--oh, it was!  And I won't write to him any more, or at least\nfor a long time, to impress him with my dignity!  And I hope it will\nhurt him very much--expecting a letter to-morrow morning, and the\nnext, and the next, and no letter coming.  He'll suffer then with\nsuspense--won't he, that's all!--and I am very glad of it!\"--Tears\nof pity for Jude's approaching sufferings at her hands mingled with\nthose which had surged up in pity for herself.\n\nThen the slim little wife of a husband whose person was disagreeable\nto her, the ethereal, fine-nerved, sensitive girl, quite unfitted by\ntemperament and instinct to fulfil the conditions of the matrimonial\nrelation with Phillotson, possibly with scarce any man, walked\nfitfully along, and panted, and brought weariness into her eyes by\ngazing and worrying hopelessly.\n\nPhillotson met her at the arrival station, and, seeing that she was\ntroubled, thought it must be owing to the depressing effect of her\naunt's death and funeral.  He began telling her of his day's doings,\nand how his friend Gillingham, a neighbouring schoolmaster whom he\nhad not seen for years, had called upon him.  While ascending to the\ntown, seated on the top of the omnibus beside him, she said suddenly\nand with an air of self-chastisement, regarding the white road and\nits bordering bushes of hazel:\n\n\"Richard--I let Mr. Fawley hold my hand a long while.  I don't know\nwhether you think it wrong?\"\n\nHe, waking apparently from thoughts of far different mould, said\nvaguely, \"Oh, did you?  What did you do that for?\"\n\n\"I don't know.  He wanted to, and I let him.\"\n\n\"I hope it pleased him.  I should think it was hardly a novelty.\"\n\nThey lapsed into silence.  Had this been a case in the court of an\nomniscient judge, he might have entered on his notes the curious fact\nthat Sue had placed the minor for the major indiscretion, and had not\nsaid a word about the kiss.\n\nAfter tea that evening Phillotson sat balancing the school registers.\nShe remained in an unusually silent, tense, and restless condition,\nand at last, saying she was tired, went to bed early.  When\nPhillotson arrived upstairs, weary with the drudgery of the\nattendance-numbers, it was a quarter to twelve o'clock.  Entering\ntheir chamber, which by day commanded a view of some thirty or forty\nmiles over the Vale of Blackmoor, and even into Outer Wessex, he went\nto the window, and, pressing his face against the pane, gazed with\nhard-breathing fixity into the mysterious darkness which now covered\nthe far-reaching scene.  He was musing, \"I think,\" he said at last,\nwithout turning his head, \"that I must get the committee to change\nthe school-stationer.  All the copybooks are sent wrong this time.\"\n\nThere was no reply.  Thinking Sue was dozing he went on:\n\n\"And there must be a rearrangement of that ventilator in the\nclass-room.  The wind blows down upon my head unmercifully and gives\nme the ear-ache.\"\n\nAs the silence seemed more absolute than ordinarily he turned round.\nThe heavy, gloomy oak wainscot, which extended over the walls\nupstairs and down in the dilapidated \"Old-Grove Place,\" and the\nmassive chimney-piece reaching to the ceiling, stood in odd contrast\nto the new and shining brass bedstead, and the new suite of birch\nfurniture that he had bought for her, the two styles seeming to nod\nto each other across three centuries upon the shaking floor.\n\n\"Soo!\" he said (this being the way in which he pronounced her name).\n\nShe was not in the bed, though she had apparently been there--the\nclothes on her side being flung back.  Thinking she might have\nforgotten some kitchen detail and gone downstairs for a moment to\nsee to it, he pulled off his coat and idled quietly enough for a\nfew minutes, when, finding she did not come, he went out upon the\nlanding, candle in hand, and said again \"Soo!\"\n\n\"Yes!\" came back to him in her voice, from the distant kitchen\nquarter.\n\n\"What are you doing down there at midnight--tiring yourself out for\nnothing!\"\n\n\"I am not sleepy; I am reading; and there is a larger fire here.\"\n\nHe went to bed.  Some time in the night he awoke.  She was not there,\neven now.  Lighting a candle he hastily stepped out upon the landing,\nand again called her name.\n\nShe answered \"Yes!\" as before, but the tones were small and confined,\nand whence they came he could not at first understand.  Under the\nstaircase was a large clothes-closet, without a window; they seemed\nto come from it.  The door was shut, but there was no lock or other\nfastening.  Phillotson, alarmed, went towards it, wondering if she\nhad suddenly become deranged.\n\n\"What are you doing in there?\" he asked.\n\n\"Not to disturb you I came here, as it was so late.\"\n\n\"But there's no bed, is there?  And no ventilation!  Why, you'll be\nsuffocated if you stay all night!\"\n\n\"Oh no, I think not.  Don't trouble about me.\"\n\n\"But--\"  Phillotson seized the knob and pulled at the door.  She had\nfastened it inside with a piece of string, which broke at his pull.\nThere being no bedstead she had flung down some rugs and made a\nlittle nest for herself in the very cramped quarters the closet\nafforded.\n\nWhen he looked in upon her she sprang out of her lair, great-eyed and\ntrembling.\n\n\"You ought not to have pulled open the door!\" she cried excitedly.\n\"It is not becoming in you!  Oh, will you go away; please will you!\"\n\nShe looked so pitiful and pleading in her white nightgown against the\nshadowy lumber-hole that he was quite worried.  She continued to\nbeseech him not to disturb her.\n\nHe said: \"I've been kind to you, and given you every liberty; and it\nis monstrous that you should feel in this way!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said she, weeping.  \"I know that!  It is wrong and wicked of\nme, I suppose!  I am very sorry.  But it is not I altogether that am\nto blame!\"\n\n\"Who is then?  Am I?\"\n\n\"No--I don't know!  The universe, I suppose--things in general,\nbecause they are so horrid and cruel!\"\n\n\"Well, it is no use talking like that.  Making a man's house so\nunseemly at this time o' night!  Eliza will hear if we don't mind.\"\n(He meant the servant.)  \"Just think if either of the parsons in this\ntown was to see us now!  I hate such eccentricities, Sue.  There's no\norder or regularity in your sentiments! ...  But I won't intrude on\nyou further; only I would advise you not to shut the door too tight,\nor I shall find you stifled to-morrow.\"\n\nOn rising the next morning he immediately looked into the closet, but\nSue had already gone downstairs.  There was a little nest where she\nhad lain, and spiders' webs hung overhead.  \"What must a woman's\naversion be when it is stronger than her fear of spiders!\" he said\nbitterly.\n\nHe found her sitting at the breakfast-table, and the meal began\nalmost in silence, the burghers walking past upon the pavement--or\nrather roadway, pavements being scarce here--which was two or three\nfeet above the level of the parlour floor.  They nodded down to the\nhappy couple their morning greetings, as they went on.\n\n\"Richard,\" she said all at once; \"would you mind my living away from\nyou?\"\n\n\"Away from me?  Why, that's what you were doing when I married you.\nWhat then was the meaning of marrying at all?\"\n\n\"You wouldn't like me any the better for telling you.\"\n\n\"I don't object to know.\"\n\n\"Because I thought I could do nothing else.  You had got my promise a\nlong time before that, remember.  Then, as time went on, I regretted\nI had promised you, and was trying to see an honourable way to break\nit off.  But as I couldn't I became rather reckless and careless\nabout the conventions.  Then you know what scandals were spread, and\nhow I was turned out of the training school you had taken such time\nand trouble to prepare me for and get me into; and this frightened\nme and it seemed then that the one thing I could do would be to let\nthe engagement stand.  Of course I, of all people, ought not to have\ncared what was said, for it was just what I fancied I never did care\nfor.  But I was a coward--as so many women are--and my theoretic\nunconventionality broke down.  If that had not entered into the case\nit would have been better to have hurt your feelings once for all\nthen, than to marry you and hurt them all my life after...  And you\nwere so generous in never giving credit for a moment to the rumour.\"\n\n\"I am bound in honesty to tell you that I weighed its probability and\ninquired of your cousin about it.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" she said with pained surprise.\n\n\"I didn't doubt you.\"\n\n\"But you inquired!\"\n\n\"I took his word.\"\n\nHer eyes had filled.  \"HE wouldn't have inquired!\" she said.\n\"But you haven't answered me.  Will you let me go away?  I know how\nirregular it is of me to ask it--\"\n\n\"It is irregular.\"\n\n\"But I do ask it!  Domestic laws should be made according to\ntemperaments, which should be classified.  If people are at all\npeculiar in character they have to suffer from the very rules that\nproduce comfort in others! ...  Will you let me?\"\n\n\"But we married--\"\n\n\"What is the use of thinking of laws and ordinances,\" she burst out,\n\"if they make you miserable when you know you are committing no sin?\"\n\n\"But you are committing a sin in not liking me.\"\n\n\"I DO like you!  But I didn't reflect it would be--that it would be\nso much more than that...  For a man and woman to live on intimate\nterms when one feels as I do is adultery, in any circumstances,\nhowever legal.  There--I've said it! ...  Will you let me, Richard?\"\n\n\"You distress me, Susanna, by such importunity!\"\n\n\"Why can't we agree to free each other?  We made the compact, and\nsurely we can cancel it--not legally of course; but we can morally,\nespecially as no new interests, in the shape of children, have arisen\nto be looked after.  Then we might be friends, and meet without pain\nto either.  Oh Richard, be my friend and have pity!  We shall both be\ndead in a few years, and then what will it matter to anybody that you\nrelieved me from constraint for a little while?  I daresay you think\nme eccentric, or super-sensitive, or something absurd.  Well--why\nshould I suffer for what I was born to be, if it doesn't hurt other\npeople?\"\n\n\"But it does--it hurts ME!  And you vowed to love me.\"\n\n\"Yes--that's it!  I am in the wrong.  I always am!  It is as culpable\nto bind yourself to love always as to believe a creed always, and as\nsilly as to vow always to like a particular food or drink!\"\n\n\"And do you mean, by living away from me, living by yourself?\"\n\n\"Well, if you insisted, yes.  But I meant living with Jude.\"\n\n\"As his wife?\"\n\n\"As I choose.\"\n\nPhillotson writhed.\n\nSue continued: \"She, or he, 'who lets the world, or his own portion\nof it, choose his plan of life for him, has no need of any other\nfaculty than the apelike one of imitation.'  J. S. Mill's words,\nthose are.  I have been reading it up.  Why can't you act upon them?\nI wish to, always.\"\n\n\"What do I care about J. S. Mill!\" moaned he.  \"I only want to lead\na quiet life!  Do you mind my saying that I have guessed what never\nonce occurred to me before our marriage--that you were in love, and\nare in love, with Jude Fawley!\"\n\n\"You may go on guessing that I am, since you have begun.  But do you\nsuppose that if I had been I should have asked you to let me go and\nlive with him?\"\n\nThe ringing of the school bell saved Phillotson from the necessity of\nreplying at present to what apparently did not strike him as being\nsuch a convincing _argumentum ad verecundiam_ as she, in her loss of\ncourage at the last moment, meant it to appear.  She was beginning to\nbe so puzzling and unstateable that he was ready to throw in with her\nother little peculiarities the extremest request which a wife could\nmake.\n\nThey proceeded to the schools that morning as usual, Sue entering\nthe class-room, where he could see the back of her head through the\nglass partition whenever he turned his eyes that way.  As he went on\ngiving and hearing lessons his forehead and eyebrows twitched from\nconcentrated agitation of thought, till at length he tore a scrap\nfrom a sheet of scribbling paper and wrote:\n\n\n   Your request prevents my attending to work at all.  I don't\n   know what I am doing!  Was it seriously made?\n\n\nHe folded the piece of paper very small, and gave it to a little\nboy to take to Sue.  The child toddled off into the class-room.\nPhillotson saw his wife turn and take the note, and the bend of her\npretty head as she read it, her lips slightly crisped, to prevent\nundue expression under fire of so many young eyes.  He could not see\nher hands, but she changed her position, and soon the child returned,\nbringing nothing in reply.  In a few minutes, however, one of Sue's\nclass appeared, with a little note similar to his own.  These words\nonly were pencilled therein:\n\n\n   I am sincerely sorry to say that it was seriously made.\n\n\nPhillotson looked more disturbed than before, and the meeting-place\nof his brows twitched again.  In ten minutes he called up the child\nhe had just sent to her, and dispatched another missive:\n\n\n   God knows I don't want to thwart you in any reasonable way.\n   My whole thought is to make you comfortable and happy.  But\n   I cannot agree to such a preposterous notion as your going\n   to live with your lover.  You would lose everybody's respect\n   and regard; and so should I!\n\n\nAfter an interval a similar part was enacted in the class-room, and\nan answer came:\n\n\n   I know you mean my good.  But I don't want to be respectable!\n   To produce \"Human development in its richest diversity\" (to\n   quote your Humboldt) is to my mind far above respectability.\n   No doubt my tastes are low--in your view--hopelessly low!\n   If you won t let me go to him, will you grant me this one\n   request--allow me to live in your house in a separate way?\n\n\nTo this he returned no answer.\n\nShe wrote again:\n\n\n   I know what you think.  But cannot you have pity on me?  I beg\n   you to; I implore you to be merciful!  I would not ask if I\n   were not almost compelled by what I can't bear!  No poor woman\n   has ever wished more than I that Eve had not fallen, so that\n   (as the primitive Christians believed) some harmless mode of\n   vegetation might have peopled Paradise.  But I won't trifle!\n   Be kind to me--even though I have not been kind to you!  I\n   will go away, go abroad, anywhere, and never trouble you.\n\n\nNearly an hour passed, and then he returned an answer:\n\n\n   I do not wish to pain you.  How well you KNOW I don't! Give me\n   a little time.  I am disposed to agree to your last request.\n\n\nOne line from her:\n\n\n   Thank you from my heart, Richard.  I do not deserve your\n   kindness.\n\n\nAll day Phillotson bent a dazed regard upon her through the glazed\npartition; and he felt as lonely as when he had not known her.\n\nBut he was as good as his word, and consented to her living apart\nin the house.  At first, when they met at meals, she had seemed\nmore composed under the new arrangement; but the irksomeness of\ntheir position worked on her temperament, and the fibres of her\nnature seemed strained like harp-strings.  She talked vaguely and\nindiscriminately to prevent his talking pertinently.\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nPhillotson was sitting up late, as was often his custom, trying to\nget together the materials for his long-neglected hobby of Roman\nantiquities.  For the first time since reviving the subject he felt a\nreturn of his old interest in it.  He forgot time and place, and when\nhe remembered himself and ascended to rest it was nearly two o'clock.\n\nHis preoccupation was such that, though he now slept on the other\nside of the house, he mechanically went to the room that he and his\nwife had occupied when he first became a tenant of Old-Grove Place,\nwhich since his differences with Sue had been hers exclusively.\nHe entered, and unconsciously began to undress.\n\nThere was a cry from the bed, and a quick movement.  Before the\nschoolmaster had realized where he was he perceived Sue starting up\nhalf-awake, staring wildly, and springing out upon the floor on the\nside away from him, which was towards the window.  This was somewhat\nhidden by the canopy of the bedstead, and in a moment he heard her\nflinging up the sash.  Before he had thought that she meant to do\nmore than get air she had mounted upon the sill and leapt out.  She\ndisappeared in the darkness, and he heard her fall below.\n\nPhillotson, horrified, ran downstairs, striking himself sharply\nagainst the newel in his haste.  Opening the heavy door he ascended\nthe two or three steps to the level of the ground, and there on the\ngravel before him lay a white heap.  Phillotson seized it in his\narms, and bringing Sue into the hall seated her on a chair, where he\ngazed at her by the flapping light of the candle which he had set\ndown in the draught on the bottom stair.\n\nShe had certainly not broken her neck.  She looked at him with eyes\nthat seemed not to take him in; and though not particularly large in\ngeneral they appeared so now.  She pressed her side and rubbed her\narm, as if conscious of pain; then stood up, averting her face, in\nevident distress at his gaze.\n\n\"Thank God--you are not killed!  Though it's not for want of\ntrying--not much hurt I hope?\"\n\nHer fall, in fact, had not been a serious one, probably owing to the\nlowness of the old rooms and to the high level of the ground without.\nBeyond a scraped elbow and a blow in the side she had apparently\nincurred little harm.\n\n\"I was asleep, I think!\" she began, her pale face still turned away\nfrom him.  \"And something frightened me--a terrible dream--I thought\nI saw you--\"  The actual circumstances seemed to come back to her,\nand she was silent.\n\nHer cloak was hanging at the back of the door, and the wretched\nPhillotson flung it round her.  \"Shall I help you upstairs?\" he asked\ndrearily; for the significance of all this sickened him of himself\nand of everything.\n\n\"No thank you, Richard.  I am very little hurt.  I can walk.\"\n\n\"You ought to lock your door,\" he mechanically said, as if lecturing\nin school.  \"Then no one could intrude even by accident.\"\n\n\"I have tried--it won't lock.  All the doors are out of order.\"\n\nThe aspect of things was not improved by her admission.  She ascended\nthe staircase slowly, the waving light of the candle shining on her.\nPhillotson did not approach her, or attempt to ascend himself till he\nheard her enter her room.  Then he fastened up the front door, and\nreturning, sat down on the lower stairs, holding the newel with one\nhand, and bowing his face into the other.  Thus he remained for a\nlong long time--a pitiable object enough to one who had seen him;\ntill, raising his head and sighing a sigh which seemed to say that\nthe business of his life must be carried on, whether he had a wife or\nno, he took the candle and went upstairs to his lonely room on the\nother side of the landing.\n\nNo further incident touching the matter between them occurred till\nthe following evening, when, immediately school was over, Phillotson\nwalked out of Shaston, saying he required no tea, and not informing\nSue where he was going.  He descended from the town level by a steep\nroad in a north-westerly direction, and continued to move downwards\ntill the soil changed from its white dryness to a tough brown clay.\nHe was now on the low alluvial beds\n\n\n   Where Duncliffe is the traveller's mark,\n   And cloty Stour's a-rolling dark.\n\n\nMore than once he looked back in the increasing obscurity of evening.\nAgainst the sky was Shaston, dimly visible\n\n\n   On the grey-topp'd height\n   Of Paladore, as pale day wore\n   Away... [William Barnes.]\n\n\nThe new-lit lights from its windows burnt with a steady shine as if\nwatching him, one of which windows was his own.  Above it he could\njust discern the pinnacled tower of Trinity Church.  The air down\nhere, tempered by the thick damp bed of tenacious clay, was not as it\nhad been above, but soft and relaxing, so that when he had walked a\nmile or two he was obliged to wipe his face with his handkerchief.\n\nLeaving Duncliffe Hill on the left he proceeded without hesitation\nthrough the shade, as a man goes on, night or day, in a district over\nwhich he has played as a boy.  He had walked altogether about four\nand a half miles\n\n\n   Where Stour receives her strength,\n   From six cleere fountains fed, [Drayton.]\n\n\nwhen he crossed a tributary of the Stour, and reached Leddenton--a\nlittle town of three or four thousand inhabitants--where he went\non to the boys' school, and knocked at the door of the master's\nresidence.\n\nA boy pupil-teacher opened it, and to Phillotson's inquiry if Mr.\nGillingham was at home, replied that he was, going at once off to his\nown house, and leaving Phillotson to find his way in as he could.  He\ndiscovered his friend putting away some books from which he had been\ngiving evening lessons.  The light of the paraffin lamp fell on\nPhillotson's face--pale and wretched by contrast with his friend's,\nwho had a cool, practical look.  They had been schoolmates in\nboyhood, and fellow-students at Wintoncester Training College, many\nyears before this time.\n\n\"Glad to see you, Dick!  But you don't look well!  Nothing the\nmatter?\"\n\nPhillotson advanced without replying, and Gillingham closed the\ncupboard and pulled up beside his visitor.\n\n\"Why you haven't been here--let me see--since you were married?\nI called, you know, but you were out; and upon my word it is such a\nclimb after dark that I have been waiting till the days are longer\nbefore lumpering up again.  I am glad you didn't wait, however.\"\n\nThough well-trained and even proficient masters, they occasionally\nused a dialect-word of their boyhood to each other in private.\n\n\"I've come, George, to explain to you my reasons for taking a step\nthat I am about to take, so that you, at least, will understand my\nmotives if other people question them anywhen--as they may, indeed\ncertainly will...  But anything is better than the present condition\nof things.  God forbid that you should ever have such an experience\nas mine!\"\n\n\"Sit down.  You don't mean--anything wrong between you and Mrs.\nPhillotson?\"\n\n\"I do...  My wretched state is that I've a wife I love who not\nonly does not love me, but--but--  Well, I won't say.  I know her\nfeeling!  I should prefer hatred from her!\"\n\n\"Ssh!\"\n\n\"And the sad part of it is that she is not so much to blame as I. She\nwas a pupil-teacher under me, as you know, and I took advantage of\nher inexperience, and toled her out for walks, and got her to agree\nto a long engagement before she well knew her own mind.  Afterwards\nshe saw somebody else, but she blindly fulfilled her engagement.\"\n\n\"Loving the other?\"\n\n\"Yes; with a curious tender solicitude seemingly; though her exact\nfeeling for him is a riddle to me--and to him too, I think--possibly\nto herself.  She is one of the oddest creatures I ever met.  However,\nI have been struck with these two facts; the extraordinary sympathy,\nor similarity, between the pair.  He is her cousin, which perhaps\naccounts for some of it.  They seem to be one person split in two!\nAnd with her unconquerable aversion to myself as a husband, even\nthough she may like me as a friend, 'tis too much to bear longer.\nShe has conscientiously struggled against it, but to no purpose.\nI cannot bear it--I cannot!  I can't answer her arguments--she has\nread ten times as much as I.  Her intellect sparkles like diamonds,\nwhile mine smoulders like brown paper...  She's one too many for me!\"\n\n\"She'll get over it, good-now?\"\n\n\"Never!  It is--but I won't go into it--there are reasons why she\nnever will.  At last she calmly and firmly asked if she might leave\nme and go to him.  The climax came last night, when, owing to my\nentering her room by accident, she jumped out of window--so strong\nwas her dread of me!  She pretended it was a dream, but that was\nto soothe me.  Now when a woman jumps out of window without caring\nwhether she breaks her neck or no, she's not to be mistaken; and this\nbeing the case I have come to a conclusion: that it is wrong to so\ntorture a fellow-creature any longer; and I won't be the inhuman\nwretch to do it, cost what it may!\"\n\n\"What--you'll let her go?  And with her lover?\"\n\n\"Whom with is her matter.  I shall let her go; with him certainly,\nif she wishes.  I know I may be wrong--I know I can't logically,\nor religiously, defend my concession to such a wish of hers, or\nharmonize it with the doctrines I was brought up in.  Only I know one\nthing: something within me tells me I am doing wrong in refusing\nher.  I, like other men, profess to hold that if a husband gets such\na so-called preposterous request from his wife, the only course that\ncan possibly be regarded as right and proper and honourable in him is\nto refuse it, and put her virtuously under lock and key, and murder\nher lover perhaps.  But is that essentially right, and proper, and\nhonourable, or is it contemptibly mean and selfish?  I don't profess\nto decide.  I simply am going to act by instinct, and let principles\ntake care of themselves.  If a person who has blindly walked into a\nquagmire cries for help, I am inclined to give it, if possible.\"\n\n\"But--you see, there's the question of neighbours and society--what\nwill happen if everybody--\"\n\n\"Oh, I am not going to be a philosopher any longer!  I only see\nwhat's under my eyes.\"\n\n\"Well--I don't agree with your instinct, Dick!\" said Gillingham\ngravely.  \"I am quite amazed, to tell the truth, that such a sedate,\nplodding fellow as you should have entertained such a craze for a\nmoment.  You said when I called that she was puzzling and peculiar:\nI think you are!\"\n\n\"Have you ever stood before a woman whom you know to be intrinsically\na good woman, while she has pleaded for release--been the man she has\nknelt to and implored indulgence of?\"\n\n\"I am thankful to say I haven't.\"\n\n\"Then I don't think you are in a position to give an opinion.  I\nhave been that man, and it makes all the difference in the world, if\none has any manliness or chivalry in him.  I had not the remotest\nidea--living apart from women as I have done for so many years--that\nmerely taking a woman to church and putting a ring upon her finger\ncould by any possibility involve one in such a daily, continuous\ntragedy as that now shared by her and me!\"\n\n\"Well, I could admit some excuse for letting her leave you, provided\nshe kept to herself.  But to go attended by a cavalier--that makes a\ndifference.\"\n\n\"Not a bit.  Suppose, as I believe, she would rather endure her\npresent misery than be made to promise to keep apart from him?\nAll that is a question for herself.  It is not the same thing at\nall as the treachery of living on with a husband and playing him\nfalse...  However, she has not distinctly implied living with him\nas wife, though I think she means to...  And, to the best of my\nunderstanding, it is not an ignoble, merely animal, feeling between\nthe two: that is the worst of it; because it makes me think their\naffection will be enduring.  I did not mean to confess to you that in\nthe first jealous weeks of my marriage, before I had come to my right\nmind, I hid myself in the school one evening when they were together\nthere, and I heard what they said.  I am ashamed of it now, though\nI suppose I was only exercising a legal right.  I found from their\nmanner that an extraordinary affinity, or sympathy, entered into\ntheir attachment, which somehow took away all flavour of grossness.\nTheir supreme desire is to be together--to share each other's\nemotions, and fancies, and dreams.\"\n\n\"Platonic!\"\n\n\"Well no.  Shelleyan would be nearer to it.  They remind me of--what\nare their names--Laon and Cythna.  Also of Paul and Virginia a\nlittle.  The more I reflect, the more ENTIRELY I am on their side!\"\n\n\"But if people did as you want to do, there'd be a general domestic\ndisintegration.  The family would no longer be the social unit.\"\n\n\"Yes--I am all abroad, I suppose!\" said Phillotson sadly.  \"I was\nnever a very bright reasoner, you remember....  And yet, I don't see\nwhy the woman and the children should not be the unit without the\nman.\"\n\n\"By the Lord Harry!--Matriarchy! ...  Does SHE say all this too?\"\n\n\"Oh no.  She little thinks I have out-Sued Sue in this--all in the\nlast twelve hours!\"\n\n\"It will upset all received opinion hereabout.  Good God--what will\nShaston say!\"\n\n\"I don't say that it won't.  I don't know--I don't know! ...  As I\nsay, I am only a feeler, not a reasoner.\"\n\n\"Now,\" said Gillingham, \"let us take it quietly, and have something\nto drink over it.\"  He went under the stairs, and produced a bottle\nof cider-wine, of which they drank a rummer each.  \"I think you are\nrafted, and not yourself,\" he continued.  \"Do go back and make up\nyour mind to put up with a few whims.  But keep her.  I hear on all\nsides that she's a charming young thing.\"\n\n\"Ah yes!  That's the bitterness of it!  Well, I won't stay.  I have a\nlong walk before me.\"\n\nGillingham accompanied his friend a mile on his way, and at parting\nexpressed his hope that this consultation, singular as its subject\nwas, would be the renewal of their old comradeship.  \"Stick to her!\"\nwere his last words, flung into the darkness after Phillotson; from\nwhich his friend answered \"Aye, aye!\"\n\nBut when Phillotson was alone under the clouds of night, and no\nsound was audible but that of the purling tributaries of the Stour,\nhe said, \"So Gillingham, my friend, you had no stronger arguments\nagainst it than those!\"\n\n\"I think she ought to be smacked, and brought to her senses--that's\nwhat I think!\" murmured Gillingham, as he walked back alone.\n\nThe next morning came, and at breakfast Phillotson told Sue:\n\n\"You may go--with whom you will.  I absolutely and unconditionally\nagree.\"\n\nHaving once come to this conclusion it seemed to Phillotson more\nand more indubitably the true one.  His mild serenity at the sense\nthat he was doing his duty by a woman who was at his mercy almost\noverpowered his grief at relinquishing her.\n\nSome days passed, and the evening of their last meal together had\ncome--a cloudy evening with wind--which indeed was very seldom absent\nin this elevated place.  How permanently it was imprinted upon his\nvision; that look of her as she glided into the parlour to tea;\na slim flexible figure; a face, strained from its roundness, and\nmarked by the pallors of restless days and nights, suggesting tragic\npossibilities quite at variance with her times of buoyancy; a trying\nof this morsel and that, and an inability to eat either.  Her nervous\nmanner, begotten of a fear lest he should be injured by her course,\nmight have been interpreted by a stranger as displeasure that\nPhillotson intruded his presence on her for the few brief minutes\nthat remained.\n\n\"You had better have a slice of ham or an egg, or something with your\ntea?  You can't travel on a mouthful of bread and butter.\"\n\nShe took the slice he helped her to; and they discussed as they sat\ntrivial questions of housekeeping, such as where he would find the\nkey of this or that cupboard, what little bills were paid, and what\nnot.\n\n\"I am a bachelor by nature, as you know, Sue,\" he said, in a heroic\nattempt to put her at her ease.  \"So that being without a wife will\nnot really be irksome to me, as it might be to other men who have\nhad one a little while.  I have, too, this grand hobby in my head of\nwriting 'The Roman Antiquities of Wessex,' which will occupy all my\nspare hours.\"\n\n\"If you will send me some of the manuscript to copy at any time,\nas you used to, I will do it with so much pleasure!\" she said with\namenable gentleness.  \"I should much like to be some help to you\nstill--as a--f-f-friend.\"\n\nPhillotson mused, and said: \"No, I think we ought to be really\nseparate, if we are to be at all.  And for this reason, that I don't\nwish to ask you any questions, and particularly wish you not to give\nme information as to your movements, or even your address...  Now,\nwhat money do you want?  You must have some, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course, Richard, I couldn't think of having any of your money\nto go away from you with!  I don't want any either.  I have enough of\nmy own to last me for a long while, and Jude will let me have--\"\n\n\"I would rather not know anything about him, if you don't mind.\nYou are free, absolutely; and your course is your own.\"\n\n\"Very well.  But I'll just say that I have packed only a change or\ntwo of my own personal clothing, and one or two little things besides\nthat are my very own.  I wish you would look into my trunk before it\nis closed.  Besides that I have only a small parcel that will go into\nJude's portmanteau.\"\n\n\"Of course I shall do no such thing as examine your luggage!  I wish\nyou would take three-quarters of the household furniture.  I don't\nwant to be bothered with it.  I have a sort of affection for a little\nof it that belonged to my poor mother and father.  But the rest you\nare welcome to whenever you like to send for it.\"\n\n\"That I shall never do.\"\n\n\"You go by the six-thirty train, don't you?  It is now a quarter to\nsix.\"\n\n\"You...  You don't seem very sorry I am going, Richard!\"\n\n\"Oh no--perhaps not.\"\n\n\"I like you much for how you have behaved.  It is a curious thing\nthat directly I have begun to regard you as not my husband, but as\nmy old teacher, I like you.  I won't be so affected as to say I love\nyou, because you know I don't, except as a friend.  But you do seem\nthat to me!\"\n\nSue was for a few moments a little tearful at these reflections, and\nthen the station omnibus came round to take her up.  Phillotson saw\nher things put on the top, handed her in, and was obliged to make an\nappearance of kissing her as he wished her good-bye, which she quite\nunderstood and imitated.  From the cheerful manner in which they\nparted the omnibus-man had no other idea than that she was going for\na short visit.\n\nWhen Phillotson got back into the house he went upstairs and opened\nthe window in the direction the omnibus had taken.  Soon the noise of\nits wheels died away.  He came down then, his face compressed like\nthat of one bearing pain; he put on his hat and went out, following\nby the same route for nearly a mile.  Suddenly turning round he came\nhome.\n\nHe had no sooner entered than the voice of his friend Gillingham\ngreeted him from the front room.\n\n\"I could make nobody hear; so finding your door open I walked in, and\nmade myself comfortable.  I said I would call, you remember.\"\n\n\"Yes.  I am much obliged to you, Gillingham, particularly for coming\nto-night.\"\n\n\"How is Mrs.--\"\n\n\"She is quite well.  She is gone--just gone.  That's her tea-cup,\nthat she drank out of only an hour ago.  And that's the plate\nshe--\"  Phillotson's throat got choked up, and he could not go on.\nHe turned and pushed the tea-things aside.\n\n\"Have you had any tea, by the by?\" he asked presently in a renewed\nvoice.\n\n\"No--yes--never mind,\" said Gillingham, preoccupied.  \"Gone, you say\nshe is?\"\n\n\"Yes...  I would have died for her; but I wouldn't be cruel to her\nin the name of the law.  She is, as I understand, gone to join her\nlover.  What they are going to do I cannot say.  Whatever it may be\nshe has my full consent to.\"\n\nThere was a stability, a ballast, in Phillotson's pronouncement which\nrestrained his friend's comment.  \"Shall I--leave you?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, no.  It is a mercy to me that you have come.  I have some\narticles to arrange and clear away.  Would you help me?\"\n\nGillingham assented; and having gone to the upper rooms the\nschoolmaster opened drawers, and began taking out all Sue's things\nthat she had left behind, and laying them in a large box.  \"She\nwouldn't take all I wanted her to,\" he continued.  \"But when I made\nup my mind to her going to live in her own way I did make up my\nmind.\"\n\n\"Some men would have stopped at an agreement to separate.\"\n\n\"I've gone into all that, and don't wish to argue it.  I was, and\nam, the most old-fashioned man in the world on the question of\nmarriage--in fact I had never thought critically about its ethics\nat all.  But certain facts stared me in the face, and I couldn't go\nagainst them.\"\n\nThey went on with the packing silently.  When it was done Phillotson\nclosed the box and turned the key.\n\n\"There,\" he said.  \"To adorn her in somebody's eyes; never again in\nmine!\"\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nFour-and-twenty hours before this time Sue had written the following\nnote to Jude:\n\n\n   It is as I told you; and I am leaving to-morrow evening.\n   Richard and I thought it could be done with less\n   obtrusiveness after dark.  I feel rather frightened, and\n   therefore ask you to be sure you are on the Melchester\n   platform to meet me.  I arrive at a little to seven.  I\n   know you will, of course, dear Jude; but I feel so timid\n   that I can't help begging you to be punctual.  He has\n   been so VERY kind to me through it all!\n\n   Now to our meeting!\n\n   S.\n\n\nAs she was carried by the omnibus farther and farther down from\nthe mountain town--the single passenger that evening--she regarded\nthe receding road with a sad face.  But no hesitation was apparent\ntherein.\n\nThe up-train by which she was departing stopped by signal only.  To\nSue it seemed strange that such a powerful organization as a railway\ntrain should be brought to a stand-still on purpose for her--a\nfugitive from her lawful home.\n\nThe twenty minutes' journey drew towards its close, and Sue began\ngathering her things together to alight.  At the moment that the\ntrain came to a stand-still by the Melchester platform a hand was\nlaid on the door and she beheld Jude.  He entered the compartment\npromptly.  He had a black bag in his hand, and was dressed in\nthe dark suit he wore on Sundays and in the evening after work.\nAltogether he looked a very handsome young fellow, his ardent\naffection for her burning in his eyes.\n\n\"Oh Jude!\"  She clasped his hand with both hers, and her tense state\ncaused her to simmer over in a little succession of dry sobs.  \"I--I\nam so glad!  I get out here?\"\n\n\"No. I get in, dear one!  I've packed.  Besides this bag I've only a\nbig box which is labelled.\"\n\n\"But don't I get out?  Aren't we going to stay here?\"\n\n\"We couldn't possibly, don't you see.  We are known here--I, at any\nrate, am well known.  I've booked for Aldbrickham; and here's your\nticket for the same place, as you have only one to here.\"\n\n\"I thought we should have stayed here,\" she repeated.\n\n\"It wouldn't have done at all.\"\n\n\"Ah!  Perhaps not.\"\n\n\"There wasn't time for me to write and say the place I had decided\non.  Aldbrickham is a much bigger town--sixty or seventy thousand\ninhabitants--and nobody knows anything about us there.\"\n\n\"And you have given up your cathedral work here?\"\n\n\"Yes.  It was rather sudden--your message coming unexpectedly.\nStrictly, I might have been made to finish out the week.  But I\npleaded urgency and I was let off.  I would have deserted any day at\nyour command, dear Sue.  I have deserted more than that for you!\"\n\n\"I fear I am doing you a lot of harm.  Ruining your prospects of the\nChurch; ruining your progress in your trade; everything!\"\n\n\"The Church is no more to me.  Let it lie!  _I_ am not to be one of\n\n\n      The soldier-saints who, row on row,\n   Burn upward each to his point of bliss,\n\n\nif any such there be!  My point of bliss is not upward, but here.\"\n\n\"Oh I seem so bad--upsetting men's courses like this!\" said she,\ntaking up in her voice the emotion that had begun in his.  But she\nrecovered her equanimity by the time they had travelled a dozen\nmiles.\n\n\"He has been so good in letting me go,\" she resumed.  \"And here's a\nnote I found on my dressing-table, addressed to you.\"\n\n\"Yes.  He's not an unworthy fellow,\" said Jude, glancing at the note.\n\"And I am ashamed of myself for hating him because he married you.\"\n\n\"According to the rule of women's whims I suppose I ought to suddenly\nlove him, because he has let me go so generously and unexpectedly,\"\nshe answered smiling.  \"But I am so cold, or devoid of gratitude, or\nso something, that even this generosity hasn't made me love him, or\nrepent, or want to stay with him as his wife; although I do feel I\nlike his large-mindedness, and respect him more than ever.\"\n\n\"It may not work so well for us as if he had been less kind, and you\nhad run away against his will,\" murmured Jude.\n\n\"That I NEVER would have done.\"\n\nJude's eyes rested musingly on her face.  Then he suddenly kissed\nher; and was going to kiss her again.  \"No--only once now--please,\nJude!\"\n\n\"That's rather cruel,\" he answered; but acquiesced.  \"Such a strange\nthing has happened to me,\" Jude continued after a silence.  \"Arabella\nhas actually written to ask me to get a divorce from her--in kindness\nto her, she says.  She wants to honestly and legally marry that man\nshe has already married virtually; and begs me to enable her to do\nit.\"\n\n\"What have you done?\"\n\n\"I have agreed.  I thought at first I couldn't do it without getting\nher into trouble about that second marriage, and I don't want to\ninjure her in any way.  Perhaps she's no worse than I am, after all!\nBut nobody knows about it over here, and I find it will not be a\ndifficult proceeding at all.  If she wants to start afresh I have\nonly too obvious reasons for not hindering her.\"\n\n\"Then you'll be free?\"\n\n\"Yes, I shall be free.\"\n\n\"Where are we booked for?\" she asked, with the discontinuity that\nmarked her to-night.\n\n\"Aldbrickham, as I said.\"\n\n\"But it will be very late when we get there?\"\n\n\"Yes.  I thought of that, and I wired for a room for us at the\nTemperance Hotel there.\"\n\n\"One?\"\n\n\"Yes--one.\"\n\nShe looked at him.  \"Oh Jude!\"  Sue bent her forehead against the\ncorner of the compartment.  \"I thought you might do it; and that I\nwas deceiving you.  But I didn't mean that!\"\n\nIn the pause which followed, Jude's eyes fixed themselves with\na stultified expression on the opposite seat.  \"Well!\" he\nsaid...  \"Well!\"\n\nHe remained in silence; and seeing how discomfited he was she put her\nface against his cheek, murmuring, \"Don't be vexed, dear!\"\n\n\"Oh--there's no harm done,\" he said.  \"But--I understood it like\nthat...  Is this a sudden change of mind?\"\n\n\"You have no right to ask me such a question; and I shan't answer!\"\nshe said, smiling.\n\n\"My dear one, your happiness is more to me than anything--although we\nseem to verge on quarrelling so often!--and your will is law to me.\nI am something more than a mere--selfish fellow, I hope.  Have it as\nyou wish!\"  On reflection his brow showed perplexity.  \"But perhaps\nit is that you don't love me--not that you have become conventional!\nMuch as, under your teaching, I hate convention, I hope it IS that,\nnot the other terrible alternative!\"\n\nEven at this obvious moment for candour Sue could not be quite candid\nas to the state of that mystery, her heart.  \"Put it down to my\ntimidity,\" she said with hurried evasiveness; \"to a woman's natural\ntimidity when the crisis comes.  I may feel as well as you that I\nhave a perfect right to live with you as you thought--from this\nmoment.  I may hold the opinion that, in a proper state of society,\nthe father of a woman's child will be as much a private matter of\nhers as the cut of her underlinen, on whom nobody will have any\nright to question her.  But partly, perhaps, because it is by his\ngenerosity that I am now free, I would rather not be other than a\nlittle rigid.  If there had been a rope-ladder, and he had run after\nus with pistols, it would have seemed different, and I may have acted\notherwise.  But don't press me and criticize me, Jude!  Assume that\nI haven't the courage of my opinions.  I know I am a poor miserable\ncreature.  My nature is not so passionate as yours!\"\n\nHe repeated simply!  \"I thought--what I naturally thought.  But if we\nare not lovers, we are not.  Phillotson thought so, I am sure.  See,\nhere is what he has written to me.\"  He opened the letter she had\nbrought, and read:\n\n\"I make only one condition--that you are tender and kind to her.  I\nknow you love her.  But even love may be cruel at times.  You are\nmade for each other: it is obvious, palpable, to any unbiased older\nperson.  You were all along 'the shadowy third' in my short life with\nher.  I repeat, take care of Sue.\"\n\n\"He's a good fellow, isn't he!\" she said with latent tears.  On\nreconsideration she added, \"He was very resigned to letting me\ngo--too resigned almost!  I never was so near being in love with him\nas when he made such thoughtful arrangements for my being comfortable\non my journey, and offering to provide money.  Yet I was not.  If I\nloved him ever so little as a wife, I'd go back to him even now.\"\n\n\"But you don't, do you?\"\n\n\"It is true--oh so terribly true!--I don't.\"\n\n\"Nor me neither, I half-fear!\" he said pettishly.  \"Nor anybody\nperhaps!  Sue, sometimes, when I am vexed with you, I think you are\nincapable of real love.\"\n\n\"That's not good and loyal of you!\" she said, and drawing away from\nhim as far as she could, looked severely out into the darkness.  She\nadded in hurt tones, without turning round: \"My liking for you is\nnot as some women's perhaps.  But it is a delight in being with you,\nof a supremely delicate kind, and I don't want to go further and risk\nit by--an attempt to intensify it!  I quite realized that, as woman\nwith man, it was a risk to come.  But, as me with you, I resolved to\ntrust you to set my wishes above your gratification.  Don't discuss\nit further, dear Jude!\"\n\n\"Of course, if it would make you reproach yourself... but you do\nlike me very much, Sue?  Say you do!  Say that you do a quarter, a\ntenth, as much as I do you, and I'll be content!\"\n\n\"I've let you kiss me, and that tells enough.\"\n\n\"Just once or so!\"\n\n\"Well--don't be a greedy boy.\"\n\nHe leant back, and did not look at her for a long time.  That\nepisode in her past history of which she had told him--of the poor\nChristminster graduate whom she had handled thus, returned to Jude's\nmind; and he saw himself as a possible second in such a torturing\ndestiny.\n\n\"This is a queer elopement!\" he murmured.  \"Perhaps you are making\na cat's paw of me with Phillotson all this time.  Upon my word it\nalmost seems so--to see you sitting up there so prim!\"\n\n\"Now you mustn't be angry--I won't let you!\" she coaxed, turning and\nmoving nearer to him.  \"You did kiss me just now, you know; and I\ndidn't dislike you to, I own it, Jude.  Only I don't want to let you\ndo it again, just yet--considering how we are circumstanced, don't\nyou see!\"\n\nHe could never resist her when she pleaded (as she well knew). And\nthey sat side by side with joined hands, till she aroused herself at\nsome thought.\n\n\"I can't possibly go to that Temperance Inn, after your telegraphing\nthat message!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"You can see well enough!\"\n\n\"Very well; there'll be some other one open, no doubt.  I have\nsometimes thought, since your marrying Phillotson because of a stupid\nscandal, that under the affectation of independent views you are as\nenslaved to the social code as any woman I know!\"\n\n\"Not mentally.  But I haven't the courage of my views, as I said\nbefore.  I didn't marry him altogether because of the scandal.\nBut sometimes a woman's LOVE OF BEING LOVED gets the better of her\nconscience, and though she is agonized at the thought of treating a\nman cruelly, she encourages him to love her while she doesn't love\nhim at all.  Then, when she sees him suffering, her remorse sets in,\nand she does what she can to repair the wrong.\"\n\n\"You simply mean that you flirted outrageously with him, poor old\nchap, and then repented, and to make reparation, married him, though\nyou tortured yourself to death by doing it.\"\n\n\"Well--if you will put it brutally!--it was a little like that--that\nand the scandal together--and your concealing from me what you ought\nto have told me before!\"\n\nHe could see that she was distressed and tearful at his criticisms,\nand soothed her, saying: \"There, dear; don't mind!  Crucify me, if\nyou will!  You know you are all the world to me, whatever you do!\"\n\n\"I am very bad and unprincipled--I know you think that!\" she said,\ntrying to blink away her tears.\n\n\"I think and know you are my dear Sue, from whom neither length nor\nbreadth, nor things present nor things to come, can divide me!\"\n\nThough so sophisticated in many things, she was such a child in others\nthat this satisfied her, and they reached the end of their journey\non the best of terms.  It was about ten o'clock when they arrived at\nAldbrickham, the county town of North Wessex.  As she would not go\nto the Temperance Hotel because of the form of his telegram, Jude\ninquired for another; and a youth who volunteered to find one wheeled\ntheir luggage to the George farther on, which proved to be the inn at\nwhich Jude had stayed with Arabella on that one occasion of their\nmeeting after their division for years.\n\nOwing, however, to their now entering it by another door, and to his\npreoccupation, he did not at first recognize the place.  When they\nhad engaged their respective rooms they went down to a late supper.\nDuring Jude's temporary absence the waiting-maid spoke to Sue.\n\n\"I think, ma'am, I remember your relation, or friend, or whatever he\nis, coming here once before--late, just like this, with his wife--a\nlady, at any rate, that wasn't you by no manner of means--jest as med\nbe with you now.\"\n\n\"Oh do you?\" said Sue, with a certain sickness of heart.  \"Though I\nthink you must be mistaken!  How long ago was it?\"\n\n\"About a month or two.  A handsome, full-figured woman.  They had\nthis room.\"\n\nWhen Jude came back and sat down to supper Sue seemed moping and\nmiserable.  \"Jude,\" she said to him plaintively, at their parting\nthat night upon the landing, \"it is not so nice and pleasant as it\nused to be with us!  I don't like it here--I can't bear the place!\nAnd I don't like you so well as I did!\"\n\n\"How fidgeted you seem, dear!  Why do you change like this?\"\n\n\"Because it was cruel to bring me here!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"You were lately here with Arabella.  There, now I have said it!\"\n\n\"Dear me, why--\" said Jude looking round him.  \"Yes--it is the same!\nI really didn't know it, Sue.  Well--it is not cruel, since we have\ncome as we have--two relations staying together.\"\n\n\"How long ago was it you were here?  Tell me, tell me!\"\n\n\"The day before I met you in Christminster, when we went back to\nMarygreen together.  I told you I had met her.\"\n\n\"Yes, you said you had met her, but you didn't tell me all.  Your\nstory was that you had met as estranged people, who were not husband\nand wife at all in Heaven's sight--not that you had made it up with\nher.\"\n\n\"We didn't make it up,\" he said sadly.  \"I can't explain, Sue.\"\n\n\"You've been false to me; you, my last hope!  And I shall never\nforget it, never!\"\n\n\"But by your own wish, dear Sue, we are only to be friends, not\nlovers!  It is so very inconsistent of you to--\"\n\n\"Friends can be jealous!\"\n\n\"I don't see that.  You concede nothing to me and I have to concede\neverything to you.  After all, you were on good terms with your\nhusband at that time.\"\n\n\"No, I wasn't, Jude.  Oh how can you think so!  And you have taken me\nin, even if you didn't intend to.\"  She was so mortified that he was\nobliged to take her into her room and close the door lest the people\nshould hear.  \"Was it this room?  Yes it was--I see by your look it\nwas!  I won't have it for mine!  Oh it was treacherous of you to have\nher again!  _I_ jumped out of the window!\"\n\n\"But Sue, she was, after all, my legal wife, if not--\"\n\nSlipping down on her knees Sue buried her face in the bed and wept.\n\n\"I never knew such an unreasonable--such a dog-in-the-manger\nfeeling,\" said Jude.  \"I am not to approach you, nor anybody else!\"\n\n\"Oh don't you UNDERSTAND my feeling?  Why don't you?  Why are you so\ngross?  _I_ jumped out of the window!\"\n\n\"Jumped out of window?\"\n\n\"I can't explain!\"\n\nIt was true that he did not understand her feelings very well.  But\nhe did a little; and began to love her none the less.\n\n\"I--I thought you cared for nobody--desired nobody in the world but\nme at that time--and ever since!\" continued Sue.\n\n\"It is true.  I did not, and don't now!\" said Jude, as distressed as\nshe.\n\n\"But you must have thought much of her!  Or--\"\n\n\"No--I need not--you don't understand me either--women never do!  Why\nshould you get into such a tantrum about nothing?\"\n\nLooking up from the quilt she pouted provokingly: \"If it hadn't been\nfor that, perhaps I would have gone on to the Temperance Hotel, after\nall, as you proposed; for I was beginning to think I did belong to\nyou!\"\n\n\"Oh, it is of no consequence!\" said Jude distantly.\n\n\"I thought, of course, that she had never been really your wife since\nshe left you of her own accord years and years ago!  My sense of it\nwas, that a parting such as yours from her, and mine from him, ended\nthe marriage.\"\n\n\"I can't say more without speaking against her, and I don't want\nto do that,\" said he.  \"Yet I must tell you one thing, which would\nsettle the matter in any case.  She has married another man--really\nmarried him!  I knew nothing about it till after the visit we made\nhere.\"\n\n\"Married another? ...  It is a crime--as the world treats it, but\ndoes not believe.\"\n\n\"There--now you are yourself again.  Yes, it is a crime--as you don't\nhold, but would fearfully concede.  But I shall never inform against\nher!  And it is evidently a prick of conscience in her that has led\nher to urge me to get a divorce, that she may remarry this man\nlegally.  So you perceive I shall not be likely to see her again.\"\n\n\"And you didn't really know anything of this when you saw her?\" said\nSue more gently, as she rose.\n\n\"I did not.  Considering all things, I don't think you ought to be\nangry, darling!\"\n\n\"I am not.  But I shan't go to the Temperance Hotel!\"\n\nHe laughed.  \"Never mind!\" he said.  \"So that I am near you, I am\ncomparatively happy.  It is more than this earthly wretch called Me\ndeserves--you spirit, you disembodied creature, you dear, sweet,\ntantalizing phantom--hardly flesh at all; so that when I put my arms\nround you I almost expect them to pass through you as through air!\nForgive me for being gross, as you call it!  Remember that our\ncalling cousins when really strangers was a snare.  The enmity of our\nparents gave a piquancy to you in my eyes that was intenser even than\nthe novelty of ordinary new acquaintance.\"\n\n\"Say those pretty lines, then, from Shelley's 'Epipsychidion' as if\nthey meant me!\" she solicited, slanting up closer to him as they\nstood.  \"Don't you know them?\"\n\n\"I know hardly any poetry,\" he replied mournfully.\n\n\"Don't you?  These are some of them:\n\n\n   There was a Being whom my spirit oft\n   Met on its visioned wanderings far aloft.\n\n       *     *     *     *     *\n\n   A seraph of Heaven, too gentle to be human,\n   Veiling beneath that radiant form of woman...\n\n\nOh it is too flattering, so I won't go on!  But say it's me!  Say\nit's me!\"\n\n\"It is you, dear; exactly like you!\"\n\n\"Now I forgive you!  And you shall kiss me just once there--not very\nlong.\"  She put the tip of her finger gingerly to her cheek; and he\ndid as commanded.  \"You do care for me very much, don't you, in spite\nof my not--you know?\"\n\n\"Yes, sweet!\" he said with a sigh; and bade her good-night.\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nIn returning to his native town of Shaston as schoolmaster Phillotson\nhad won the interest and awakened the memories of the inhabitants,\nwho, though they did not honour him for his miscellaneous acquirements\nas he would have been honoured elsewhere, retained for him a sincere\nregard.  When, shortly after his arrival, he brought home a pretty\nwife--awkwardly pretty for him, if he did not take care, they\nsaid--they were glad to have her settle among them.\n\nFor some time after her flight from that home Sue's absence did not\nexcite comment.  Her place as monitor in the school was taken by\nanother young woman within a few days of her vacating it, which\nsubstitution also passed without remark, Sue's services having been\nof a provisional nature only.  When, however, a month had passed, and\nPhillotson casually admitted to an acquaintance that he did not know\nwhere his wife was staying, curiosity began to be aroused; till,\njumping to conclusions, people ventured to affirm that Sue had played\nhim false and run away from him.  The schoolmaster's growing languor\nand listlessness over his work gave countenance to the idea.\n\nThough Phillotson had held his tongue as long as he could, except to\nhis friend Gillingham, his honesty and directness would not allow him\nto do so when misapprehensions as to Sue's conduct spread abroad.\nOn a Monday morning the chairman of the school committee called, and\nafter attending to the business of the school drew Phillotson aside\nout of earshot of the children.\n\n\"You'll excuse my asking, Phillotson, since everybody is talking of\nit: is this true as to your domestic affairs--that your wife's going\naway was on no visit, but a secret elopement with a lover?  If so, I\ncondole with you.\"\n\n\"Don't,\" said Phillotson.  \"There was no secret about it.\"\n\n\"She has gone to visit friends?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then what has happened?\"\n\n\"She has gone away under circumstances that usually call for\ncondolence with the husband.  But I gave my consent.\"\n\nThe chairman looked as if he had not apprehended the remark.\n\n\"What I say is quite true,\" Phillotson continued testily.  \"She asked\nleave to go away with her lover, and I let her.  Why shouldn't I?  A\nwoman of full age, it was a question of her own conscience--not for\nme.  I was not her gaoler.  I can't explain any further.  I don't\nwish to be questioned.\"\n\nThe children observed that much seriousness marked the faces of\nthe two men, and went home and told their parents that something\nnew had happened about Mrs. Phillotson.  Then Phillotson's little\nmaidservant, who was a schoolgirl just out of her standards, said\nthat Mr. Phillotson had helped in his wife's packing, had offered\nher what money she required, and had written a friendly letter to\nher young man, telling him to take care of her.  The chairman of\ncommittee thought the matter over, and talked to the other managers\nof the school, till a request came to Phillotson to meet them\nprivately.  The meeting lasted a long time, and at the end the\nschool-master came home, looking as usual pale and worn.  Gillingham\nwas sitting in his house awaiting him.\n\n\"Well; it is as you said,\" observed Phillotson, flinging himself\ndown wearily in a chair.  \"They have requested me to send in my\nresignation on account of my scandalous conduct in giving my tortured\nwife her liberty--or, as they call it, condoning her adultery.  But I\nshan't resign!\"\n\n\"I think I would.\"\n\n\"I won't. It is no business of theirs.  It doesn't affect me in my\npublic capacity at all.  They may expel me if they like.\"\n\n\"If you make a fuss it will get into the papers, and you'll never get\nappointed to another school.  You see, they have to consider what\nyou did as done by a teacher of youth--and its effects as such upon\nthe morals of the town; and, to ordinary opinion, your position is\nindefensible.  You must let me say that.\"\n\nTo this good advice, however, Phillotson would not listen.\n\n\"I don't care,\" he said.  \"I don't go unless I am turned out.  And\nfor this reason; that by resigning I acknowledge I have acted wrongly\nby her; when I am more and more convinced every day that in the sight\nof Heaven and by all natural, straightforward humanity, I have acted\nrightly.\"\n\nGillingham saw that his rather headstrong friend would not be able to\nmaintain such a position as this; but he said nothing further, and\nin due time--indeed, in a quarter of an hour--the formal letter of\ndismissal arrived, the managers having remained behind to write it\nafter Phillotson's withdrawal.  The latter replied that he should not\naccept dismissal; and called a public meeting, which he attended,\nalthough he looked so weak and ill that his friend implored him to\nstay at home.  When he stood up to give his reasons for contesting\nthe decision of the managers he advanced them firmly, as he had\ndone to his friend, and contended, moreover, that the matter was a\ndomestic theory which did not concern them.  This they over-ruled,\ninsisting that the private eccentricities of a teacher came quite\nwithin their sphere of control, as it touched the morals of those he\ntaught.  Phillotson replied that he did not see how an act of natural\ncharity could injure morals.\n\nAll the respectable inhabitants and well-to-do fellow-natives of\nthe town were against Phillotson to a man.  But, somewhat to his\nsurprise, some dozen or more champions rose up in his defence as from\nthe ground.\n\nIt has been stated that Shaston was the anchorage of a curious and\ninteresting group of itinerants, who frequented the numerous fairs\nand markets held up and down Wessex during the summer and autumn\nmonths.  Although Phillotson had never spoken to one of these\ngentlemen they now nobly led the forlorn hope in his defence.\nThe body included two cheap Jacks, a shooting-gallery proprietor\nand the ladies who loaded the guns, a pair of boxing-masters, a\nsteam-roundabout manager, two travelling broom-makers, who called\nthemselves widows, a gingerbread-stall keeper, a swing-boat owner,\nand a \"test-your-strength\" man.\n\nThis generous phalanx of supporters, and a few others of independent\njudgment, whose own domestic experiences had been not without\nvicissitude, came up and warmly shook hands with Phillotson; after\nwhich they expressed their thoughts so strongly to the meeting that\nissue was joined, the result being a general scuffle, wherein a black\nboard was split, three panes of the school windows were broken,\nan inkbottle was spilled over a town-councillor's shirt front,\na churchwarden was dealt such a topper with the map of Palestine\nthat his head went right through Samaria, and many black eyes and\nbleeding noses were given, one of which, to everybody's horror, was\nthe venerable incumbent's, owing to the zeal of an emancipated\nchimney-sweep, who took the side of Phillotson's party.  When\nPhillotson saw the blood running down the rector's face he deplored\nalmost in groans the untoward and degrading circumstances, regretted\nthat he had not resigned when called upon, and went home so ill that\nnext morning he could not leave his bed.\n\nThe farcical yet melancholy event was the beginning of a serious\nillness for him; and he lay in his lonely bed in the pathetic state\nof mind of a middle-aged man who perceives at length that his\nlife, intellectual and domestic, is tending to failure and gloom.\nGillingham came to see him in the evenings, and on one occasion\nmentioned Sue's name.\n\n\"She doesn't care anything about me!\" said Phillotson.  \"Why should\nshe?\"\n\n\"She doesn't know you are ill.\"\n\n\"So much the better for both of us.\"\n\n\"Where are her lover and she living?\"\n\n\"At Melchester--I suppose; at least he was living there some time\nago.\"\n\nWhen Gillingham reached home he sat and reflected, and at last wrote\nan anonymous line to Sue, on the bare chance of its reaching her,\nthe letter being enclosed in an envelope addressed to Jude at the\ndiocesan capital.  Arriving at that place it was forwarded to\nMarygreen in North Wessex, and thence to Aldbrickham by the only\nperson who knew his present address--the widow who had nursed his\naunt.\n\nThree days later, in the evening, when the sun was going down in\nsplendour over the lowlands of Blackmoor, and making the Shaston\nwindows like tongues of fire to the eyes of the rustics in that vale,\nthe sick man fancied that he heard somebody come to the house, and a\nfew minutes after there was a tap at the bedroom door.  Phillotson\ndid not speak; the door was hesitatingly opened, and there\nentered--Sue.\n\nShe was in light spring clothing, and her advent seemed ghostly--like\nthe flitting in of a moth.  He turned his eyes upon her, and flushed;\nbut appeared to check his primary impulse to speak.\n\n\"I have no business here,\" she said, bending her frightened face to\nhim.  \"But I heard you were ill--very ill; and--and as I know that\nyou recognize other feelings between man and woman than physical\nlove, I have come.\"\n\n\"I am not very ill, my dear friend.  Only unwell.\"\n\n\"I didn't know that; and I am afraid that only a severe illness would\nhave justified my coming!\"\n\n\"Yes... yes.  And I almost wish you had not come!  It is a little\ntoo soon--that's all I mean.  Still, let us make the best of it.  You\nhaven't heard about the school, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No--what about it?\"\n\n\"Only that I am going away from here to another place.  The managers\nand I don't agree, and we are going to part--that's all.\"\n\nSue did not for a moment, either now or later, suspect what troubles\nhad resulted to him from letting her go; it never once seemed to\ncross her mind, and she had received no news whatever from Shaston.\nThey talked on slight and ephemeral subjects, and when his tea was\nbrought up he told the amazed little servant that a cup was to be set\nfor Sue.  That young person was much more interested in their history\nthan they supposed, and as she descended the stairs she lifted her\neyes and hands in grotesque amazement.  While they sipped Sue went\nto the window and thoughtfully said, \"It is such a beautiful sunset,\nRichard.\"\n\n\"They are mostly beautiful from here, owing to the rays crossing the\nmist of the vale.  But I lose them all, as they don't shine into this\ngloomy corner where I lie.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't you like to see this particular one?  It is like heaven\nopened.\"\n\n\"Ah yes!  But I can't.\"\n\n\"I'll help you to.\"\n\n\"No--the bedstead can't be shifted.\"\n\n\"But see how I mean.\"\n\nShe went to where a swing-glass stood, and taking it in her hands\ncarried it to a spot by the window where it could catch the sunshine,\nmoving the glass till the beams were reflected into Phillotson's\nface.\n\n\"There--you can see the great red sun now!\" she said.  \"And I am\nsure it will cheer you--I do so hope it will!\"  She spoke with a\nchildlike, repentant kindness, as if she could not do too much for\nhim.\n\nPhillotson smiled sadly.  \"You are an odd creature!\" he murmured as\nthe sun glowed in his eyes.  \"The idea of your coming to see me after\nwhat has passed!\"\n\n\"Don't let us go back upon that!\" she said quickly.  \"I have to catch\nthe omnibus for the train, as Jude doesn't know I have come; he was\nout when I started; so I must return home almost directly.  Richard,\nI am so very glad you are better.  You don't hate me, do you?  You\nhave been such a kind friend to me!\"\n\n\"I am glad to know you think so,\" said Phillotson huskily.  \"No.\nI don't hate you!\"\n\nIt grew dusk quickly in the gloomy room during their intermittent\nchat, and when candles were brought and it was time to leave she put\nher hand in his or rather allowed it to flit through his; for she was\nsignificantly light in touch.  She had nearly closed the door when he\nsaid, \"Sue!\"  He had noticed that, in turning away from him, tears\nwere on her face and a quiver in her lip.\n\nIt was bad policy to recall her--he knew it while he pursued it.\nBut he could not help it.  She came back.\n\n\"Sue,\" he murmured, \"do you wish to make it up, and stay?  I'll\nforgive you and condone everything!\"\n\n\"Oh you can't, you can't!\" she said hastily.  \"You can't condone it\nnow!\"\n\n\"HE is your husband now, in effect, you mean, of course?\"\n\n\"You may assume it.  He is obtaining a divorce from his wife\nArabella.\"\n\n\"His wife!  It is altogether news to me that he has a wife.\"\n\n\"It was a bad marriage.\"\n\n\"Like yours.\"\n\n\"Like mine.  He is not doing it so much on his own account as on\nhers.  She wrote and told him it would be a kindness to her, since\nthen she could marry and live respectably.  And Jude has agreed.\"\n\n\"A wife...  A kindness to her.  Ah, yes; a kindness to her to release\nher altogether...  But I don't like the sound of it.  I can forgive,\nSue.\"\n\n\"No, no!  You can't have me back now I have been so wicked--as to do\nwhat I have done!\"\n\nThere had arisen in Sue's face that incipient fright which showed\nitself whenever he changed from friend to husband, and which made her\nadopt any line of defence against marital feeling in him.  \"I MUST go\nnow.  I'll come again--may I?\"\n\n\"I don't ask you to go, even now.  I ask you to stay.\"\n\n\"I thank you, Richard; but I must.  As you are not so ill as I\nthought, I CANNOT stay!\"\n\n\"She's his--his from lips to heel!\" said Phillotson; but so faintly\nthat in closing the door she did not hear it.  The dread of a\nreactionary change in the schoolmaster's sentiments, coupled,\nperhaps, with a faint shamefacedness at letting even him know\nwhat a slipshod lack of thoroughness, from a man's point of view,\ncharacterized her transferred allegiance, prevented her telling him\nof her, thus far, incomplete relations with Jude; and Phillotson lay\nwrithing like a man in hell as he pictured the prettily dressed,\nmaddening compound of sympathy and averseness who bore his name,\nreturning impatiently to the home of her lover.\n\nGillingham was so interested in Phillotson's affairs, and so\nseriously concerned about him, that he walked up the hill-side to\nShaston two or three times a week, although, there and back, it was\na journey of nine miles, which had to be performed between tea and\nsupper, after a hard day's work in school.  When he called on the\nnext occasion after Sue's visit his friend was downstairs, and\nGillingham noticed that his restless mood had been supplanted by a\nmore fixed and composed one.\n\n\"She's been here since you called last,\" said Phillotson.\n\n\"Not Mrs. Phillotson?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Ah!  You have made it up?\"\n\n\"No...  She just came, patted my pillow with her little white hand,\nplayed the thoughtful nurse for half an hour, and went away.\"\n\n\"Well--I'm hanged!  A little hussy!\"\n\n\"What do you say?\"\n\n\"Oh--nothing!\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean, what a tantalizing, capricious little woman!  If she were\nnot your wife--\"\n\n\"She is not; she's another man's except in name and law.  And I have\nbeen thinking--it was suggested to me by a conversation I had with\nher--that, in kindness to her, I ought to dissolve the legal tie\naltogether; which, singularly enough, I think I can do, now she has\nbeen back, and refused my request to stay after I said I had forgiven\nher.  I believe that fact would afford me opportunity of doing it,\nthough I did not see it at the moment.  What's the use of keeping\nher chained on to me if she doesn't belong to me?  I know--I feel\nabsolutely certain--that she would welcome my taking such a step as\nthe greatest charity to her.  For though as a fellow-creature she\nsympathizes with, and pities me, and even weeps for me, as a husband\nshe cannot endure me--she loathes me--there's no use in mincing\nwords--she loathes me, and my only manly, and dignified, and merciful\ncourse is to complete what I have begun...  And for worldly reasons,\ntoo, it will be better for her to be independent.  I have hopelessly\nruined my prospects because of my decision as to what was best for\nus, though she does not know it; I see only dire poverty ahead from\nmy feet to the grave; for I can be accepted as teacher no more.  I\nshall probably have enough to do to make both ends meet during the\nremainder of my life, now my occupation's gone; and I shall be\nbetter able to bear it alone.  I may as well tell you that what has\nsuggested my letting her go is some news she brought me--the news\nthat Fawley is doing the same.\"\n\n\"Oh--he had a spouse, too?  A queer couple, these lovers!\"\n\n\"Well--I don't want your opinion on that.  What I was going to say is\nthat my liberating her can do her no possible harm, and will open up\na chance of happiness for her which she has never dreamt of hitherto.\nFor then they'll be able to marry, as they ought to have done at\nfirst.\"\n\nGillingham did not hurry to reply.  \"I may disagree with your\nmotive,\" he said gently, for he respected views he could not share.\n\"But I think you are right in your determination--if you can carry it\nout. I doubt, however, if you can.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPart Fifth\n\n\nAT ALDBRICKHAM AND ELSEWHERE\n\n\n\n   \"Thy aerial part, and all the fiery parts which are\n    mingled in thee, though by nature they have an upward\n    tendency, still in obedience to the disposition of the\n    universe they are over-powered here in the compound\n    mass the body.\"--M.  ANTONINUS (Long).\n\n\nI\n\n\nHow Gillingham's doubts were disposed of will most quickly appear by\npassing over the series of dreary months and incidents that followed\nthe events of the last chapter, and coming on to a Sunday in the\nFebruary of the year following.\n\nSue and Jude were living in Aldbrickham, in precisely the same\nrelations that they had established between themselves when she\nleft Shaston to join him the year before.  The proceedings in the\nlaw-courts had reached their consciousness, but as a distant sound\nand an occasional missive which they hardly understood.\n\nThey had met, as usual, to breakfast together in the little house\nwith Jude's name on it, that he had taken at fifteen pounds a year,\nwith three-pounds-ten extra for rates and taxes, and furnished with\nhis aunt's ancient and lumbering goods, which had cost him about\ntheir full value to bring all the way from Marygreen.  Sue kept\nhouse, and managed everything.\n\nAs he entered the room this morning Sue held up a letter she had just\nreceived.\n\n\"Well; and what is it about?\" he said after kissing her.\n\n\"That the decree _nisi_ in the case of Phillotson _versus_ Phillotson\nand Fawley, pronounced six months ago, has just been made absolute.\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Jude, as he sat down.\n\nThe same concluding incident in Jude's suit against Arabella had\noccurred about a month or two earlier.  Both cases had been too\ninsignificant to be reported in the papers, further than by name in\na long list of other undefended cases.\n\n\"Now then, Sue, at any rate, you can do what you like!\"  He looked at\nhis sweetheart curiously.\n\n\"Are we--you and I--just as free now as if we had never married at\nall?\"\n\n\"Just as free--except, I believe, that a clergyman may object\npersonally to remarry you, and hand the job on to somebody else.\"\n\n\"But I wonder--do you think it is really so with us?  I know it is\ngenerally.  But I have an uncomfortable feeling that my freedom has\nbeen obtained under false pretences!\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Well--if the truth about us had been known, the decree wouldn't have\nbeen pronounced.  It is only, is it, because we have made no defence,\nand have led them into a false supposition?  Therefore is my freedom\nlawful, however proper it may be?\"\n\n\"Well--why did you let it be under false pretences?  You have only\nyourself to blame,\" he said mischievously.\n\n\"Jude--don't! You ought not to be touchy about that still.  You must\ntake me as I am.\"\n\n\"Very well, darling: so I will.  Perhaps you were right.  As to your\nquestion, we were not obliged to prove anything.  That was their\nbusiness.  Anyhow we are living together.\"\n\n\"Yes.  Though not in their sense.\"\n\n\"One thing is certain, that however the decree may be brought\nabout, a marriage is dissolved when it is dissolved.  There is this\nadvantage in being poor obscure people like us--that these things are\ndone for us in a rough and ready fashion.  It was the same with me\nand Arabella.  I was afraid her criminal second marriage would have\nbeen discovered, and she punished; but nobody took any interest in\nher--nobody inquired, nobody suspected it.  If we'd been patented\nnobilities we should have had infinite trouble, and days and weeks\nwould have been spent in investigations.\"\n\nBy degrees Sue acquired her lover's cheerfulness at the sense of\nfreedom, and proposed that they should take a walk in the fields,\neven if they had to put up with a cold dinner on account of it.\nJude agreed, and Sue went up-stairs and prepared to start, putting\non a joyful coloured gown in observance of her liberty; seeing which\nJude put on a lighter tie.\n\n\"Now we'll strut arm and arm,\" he said, \"like any other engaged\ncouple.  We've a legal right to.\"\n\nThey rambled out of the town, and along a path over the low-lying\nlands that bordered it, though these were frosty now, and the\nextensive seed-fields were bare of colour and produce.  The pair,\nhowever, were so absorbed in their own situation that their\nsurroundings were little in their consciousness.\n\n\"Well, my dearest, the result of all this is that we can marry after\na decent interval.\"\n\n\"Yes; I suppose we can,\" said Sue, without enthusiasm.\n\n\"And aren't we going to?\"\n\n\"I don't like to say no, dear Jude; but I feel just the same about\nit now as I have done all along.  I have just the same dread lest an\niron contract should extinguish your tenderness for me, and mine for\nyou, as it did between our unfortunate parents.\"\n\n\"Still, what can we do?  I do love you, as you know, Sue.\"\n\n\"I know it abundantly.  But I think I would much rather go on living\nalways as lovers, as we are living now, and only meeting by day.  It\nis so much sweeter--for the woman at least, and when she is sure of\nthe man.  And henceforward we needn't be so particular as we have\nbeen about appearances.\"\n\n\"Our experiences of matrimony with others have not been encouraging,\nI own,\" said he, with some gloom; \"either owing to our own\ndissatisfied, unpractical natures, or by our misfortune.  But we\ntwo--\"\n\n\"Should be two dissatisfied ones linked together, which would be\ntwice as bad as before...  I think I should begin to be afraid of\nyou, Jude, the moment you had contracted to cherish me under a\nGovernment stamp, and I was licensed to be loved on the premises by\nyou--Ugh, how horrible and sordid!  Although, as you are, free, I\ntrust you more than any other man in the world.\"\n\n\"No, no--don't say I should change!\" he expostulated; yet there was\nmisgiving in his own voice also.\n\n\"Apart from ourselves, and our unhappy peculiarities, it is foreign\nto a man's nature to go on loving a person when he is told that\nhe must and shall be that person's lover.  There would be a much\nlikelier chance of his doing it if he were told not to love.  If the\nmarriage ceremony consisted in an oath and signed contract between\nthe parties to cease loving from that day forward, in consideration\nof personal possession being given, and to avoid each other's society\nas much as possible in public, there would be more loving couples\nthan there are now.  Fancy the secret meetings between the perjuring\nhusband and wife, the denials of having seen each other, the\nclambering in at bedroom windows, and the hiding in closets!  There'd\nbe little cooling then.\"\n\n\"Yes; but admitting this, or something like it, to be true, you are\nnot the only one in the world to see it, dear little Sue.  People go\non marrying because they can't resist natural forces, although many\nof them may know perfectly well that they are possibly buying a\nmonth's pleasure with a life's discomfort.  No doubt my father and\nmother, and your father and mother, saw it, if they at all resembled\nus in habits of observation.  But then they went and married just the\nsame, because they had ordinary passions.  But you, Sue, are such a\nphantasmal, bodiless creature, one who--if you'll allow me to say\nit--has so little animal passion in you, that you can act upon reason\nin the matter, when we poor unfortunate wretches of grosser substance\ncan't.\"\n\n\"Well,\" she sighed, \"you've owned that it would probably end in\nmisery for us.  And I am not so exceptional a woman as you think.\nFewer women like marriage than you suppose, only they enter into it\nfor the dignity it is assumed to confer, and the social advantages\nit gains them sometimes--a dignity and an advantage that I am quite\nwilling to do without.\"\n\nJude fell back upon his old complaint--that, intimate as they were,\nhe had never once had from her an honest, candid declaration that she\nloved or could love him.  \"I really fear sometimes that you cannot,\"\nhe said, with a dubiousness approaching anger.  \"And you are so\nreticent.  I know that women are taught by other women that they\nmust never admit the full truth to a man.  But the highest form of\naffection is based on full sincerity on both sides.  Not being men,\nthese women don't know that in looking back on those he has had\ntender relations with, a man's heart returns closest to her who\nwas the soul of truth in her conduct.  The better class of man,\neven if caught by airy affectations of dodging and parrying, is not\nretained by them.  A Nemesis attends the woman who plays the game of\nelusiveness too often, in the utter contempt for her that, sooner\nor later, her old admirers feel; under which they allow her to go\nunlamented to her grave.\"\n\nSue, who was regarding the distance, had acquired a guilty look; and\nshe suddenly replied in a tragic voice: \"I don't think I like you\nto-day so well as I did, Jude!\"\n\n\"Don't you?  Why?\"\n\n\"Oh, well--you are not nice--too sermony.  Though I suppose I am so\nbad and worthless that I deserve the utmost rigour of lecturing!\"\n\n\"No, you are not bad.  You are a dear.  But as slippery as an eel\nwhen I want to get a confession from you.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, I am bad, and obstinate, and all sorts!  It is no use your\npretending I am not!  People who are good don't want scolding as I\ndo...  But now that I have nobody but you, and nobody to defend me,\nit is very hard that I mustn't have my own way in deciding how I'll\nlive with you, and whether I'll be married or no!\"\n\n\"Sue, my own comrade and sweetheart, I don't want to force you either\nto marry or to do the other thing--of course I don't!  It is too\nwicked of you to be so pettish!  Now we won't say any more about it,\nand go on just the same as we have done; and during the rest of our\nwalk we'll talk of the meadows only, and the floods, and the prospect\nof the farmers this coming year.\"\n\nAfter this the subject of marriage was not mentioned by them for\nseveral days, though living as they were with only a landing between\nthem it was constantly in their minds.  Sue was assisting Jude very\nmaterially now: he had latterly occupied himself on his own account\nin working and lettering headstones, which he kept in a little yard\nat the back of his little house, where in the intervals of domestic\nduties she marked out the letters full size for him, and blacked them\nin after he had cut them.  It was a lower class of handicraft than\nwere his former performances as a cathedral mason, and his only\npatrons were the poor people who lived in his own neighbourhood,\nand knew what a cheap man this \"Jude Fawley: Monumental Mason\"\n(as he called himself on his front door) was to employ for the\nsimple memorials they required for their dead.  But he seemed more\nindependent than before, and it was the only arrangement under which\nSue, who particularly wished to be no burden on him, could render any\nassistance.\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nIt was an evening at the end of the month, and Jude had just returned\nhome from hearing a lecture on ancient history in the public hall not\nfar off.  When he entered, Sue, who had been keeping indoors during\nhis absence, laid out supper for him.  Contrary to custom she did not\nspeak.  Jude had taken up some illustrated paper, which he perused\ntill, raising his eyes, he saw that her face was troubled.\n\n\"Are you depressed, Sue?\" he said.\n\nShe paused a moment.  \"I have a message for you,\" she answered.\n\n\"Somebody has called?\"\n\n\"Yes.  A woman.\"  Sue's voice quavered as she spoke, and she suddenly\nsat down from her preparations, laid her hands in her lap, and looked\ninto the fire.  \"I don't know whether I did right or not!\" she\ncontinued.  \"I said you were not at home, and when she said she would\nwait, I said I thought you might not be able to see her.\"\n\n\"Why did you say that, dear?  I suppose she wanted a headstone.  Was\nshe in mourning?\"\n\n\"No. She wasn't in mourning, and she didn't want a headstone; and I\nthought you couldn't see her.\"  Sue looked critically and imploringly\nat him.\n\n\"But who was she?  Didn't she say?\"\n\n\"No. She wouldn't give her name.  But I know who she was--I think I\ndo!  It was Arabella!\"\n\n\"Heaven save us!  What should Arabella come for?  What made you think\nit was she?\"\n\n\"Oh, I can hardly tell.  But I know it was!  I feel perfectly certain\nit was--by the light in her eyes as she looked at me.  She was a\nfleshy, coarse woman.\"\n\n\"Well--I should not have called Arabella coarse exactly, except in\nspeech, though she may be getting so by this time under the duties of\nthe public house.  She was rather handsome when I knew her.\"\n\n\"Handsome!  But yes!--so she is!\"\n\n\"I think I heard a quiver in your little mouth.  Well, waiving that,\nas she is nothing to me, and virtuously married to another man, why\nshould she come troubling us?\"\n\n\"Are you sure she's married?  Have you definite news of it?\"\n\n\"No--not definite news.  But that was why she asked me to release\nher.  She and the man both wanted to lead a proper life, as I\nunderstood.\"\n\n\"Oh Jude--it was, it WAS Arabella!\" cried Sue, covering her eyes\nwith her hand.  \"And I am so miserable!  It seems such an ill omen,\nwhatever she may have come for.  You could not possibly see her,\ncould you?\"\n\n\"I don't really think I could.  It would be so very painful to talk\nto her now--for her as much as for me.  However, she's gone.  Did she\nsay she would come again?\"\n\n\"No. But she went away very reluctantly.\"\n\nSue, whom the least thing upset, could not eat any supper, and when\nJude had finished his he prepared to go to bed.  He had no sooner\nraked out the fire, fastened the doors, and got to the top of the\nstairs than there came a knock.  Sue instantly emerged from her room,\nwhich she had but just entered.\n\n\"There she is again!\"  Sue whispered in appalled accents.\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"She knocked like that last time.\"\n\nThey listened, and the knocking came again.  No servant was kept in\nthe house, and if the summons were to be responded to one of them\nwould have to do it in person.  \"I'll open a window,\" said Jude.\n\"Whoever it is cannot be expected to be let in at this time.\"\n\nHe accordingly went into his bedroom and lifted the sash.  The lonely\nstreet of early retiring workpeople was empty from end to end save of\none figure--that of a woman walking up and down by the lamp a few\nyards off.\n\n\"Who's there?\" he asked.\n\n\"Is that Mr. Fawley?\" came up from the woman, in a voice which was\nunmistakably Arabella's.\n\nJude replied that it was.\n\n\"Is it she?\" asked Sue from the door, with lips apart.\n\n\"Yes, dear,\" said Jude.  \"What do you want, Arabella?\" he inquired.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Jude, for disturbing you,\" said Arabella humbly.\n\"But I called earlier--I wanted particularly to see you to-night, if\nI could.  I am in trouble, and have nobody to help me!\"\n\n\"In trouble, are you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThere was a silence.  An inconvenient sympathy seemed to be rising in\nJude's breast at the appeal.  \"But aren't you married?\" he said.\n\nArabella hesitated.  \"No, Jude, I am not,\" she returned.  \"He\nwouldn't, after all.  And I am in great difficulty.  I hope to get\nanother situation as barmaid soon.  But it takes time, and I really\nam in great distress because of a sudden responsibility that's been\nsprung upon me from Australia; or I wouldn't trouble you--believe me\nI wouldn't. I want to tell you about it.\"\n\nSue remained at gaze, in painful tension, hearing every word, but\nspeaking none.\n\n\"You are not really in want of money, Arabella?\" he asked, in a\ndistinctly softened tone.\n\n\"I have enough to pay for the night's lodging I have obtained, but\nbarely enough to take me back again.\"\n\n\"Where are you living?\"\n\n\"In London still.\"  She was about to give the address, but she\nsaid, \"I am afraid somebody may hear, so I don't like to call out\nparticulars of myself so loud.  If you could come down and walk\na little way with me towards the Prince Inn, where I am staying\nto-night, I would explain all.  You may as well, for old time's\nsake!\"\n\n\"Poor thing!  I must do her the kindness of hearing what's the\nmatter, I suppose,\" said Jude in much perplexity.  \"As she's going\nback to-morrow it can't make much difference.\"\n\n\"But you can go and see her to-morrow, Jude!  Don't go now, Jude!\"\ncame in plaintive accents from the doorway.  \"Oh, it is only to\nentrap you, I know it is, as she did before!  Don't go, dear!  She is\nsuch a low-passioned woman--I can see it in her shape, and hear it in\nher voice!\n\n\"But I shall go,\" said Jude.  \"Don't attempt to detain me, Sue.  God\nknows I love her little enough now, but I don't want to be cruel to\nher.\"  He turned to the stairs.\n\n\"But she's not your wife!\" cried Sue distractedly.  \"And I--\"\n\n\"And you are not either, dear, yet,\" said Jude.\n\n\"Oh, but are you going to her?  Don't!  Stay at home!  Please, please\nstay at home, Jude, and not go to her, now she's not your wife any\nmore than I!\"\n\n\"Well, she is, rather more than you, come to that,\" he said, taking\nhis hat determinedly.  \"I've wanted you to be, and I've waited with\nthe patience of Job, and I don't see that I've got anything by my\nself-denial.  I shall certainly give her something, and hear what it\nis she is so anxious to tell me; no man could do less!\"\n\nThere was that in his manner which she knew it would be futile to\noppose.  She said no more, but, turning to her room as meekly as a\nmartyr, heard him go downstairs, unbolt the door, and close it\nbehind him.  With a woman's disregard of her dignity when in the\npresence of nobody but herself, she also trotted down, sobbing\narticulately as she went.  She listened.  She knew exactly how far\nit was to the inn that Arabella had named as her lodging.  It would\noccupy about seven minutes to get there at an ordinary walking pace;\nseven to come back again.  If he did not return in fourteen minutes\nhe would have lingered.  She looked at the clock.  It was twenty-five\nminutes to eleven.  He MIGHT enter the inn with Arabella, as they\nwould reach it before closing time; she might get him to drink with\nher; and Heaven only knew what disasters would befall him then.\n\nIn a still suspense she waited on.  It seemed as if the whole time\nhad nearly elapsed when the door was opened again, and Jude appeared.\n\nSue gave a little ecstatic cry.  \"Oh, I knew I could trust you!--how\ngood you are!\"--she began.\n\n\"I can't find her anywhere in this street, and I went out in my\nslippers only.  She has walked on, thinking I've been so hard-hearted\nas to refuse her requests entirely, poor woman.  I've come back for\nmy boots, as it is beginning to rain.\"\n\n\"Oh, but why should you take such trouble for a woman who has served\nyou so badly!\" said Sue in a jealous burst of disappointment.\n\n\"But, Sue, she's a woman, and I once cared for her; and one can't be\na brute in such circumstances.\"\n\n\"She isn't your wife any longer!\" exclaimed Sue, passionately\nexcited.  \"You MUSTN'T go out to find her!  It isn't right!  You\nCAN'T join her, now she's a stranger to you.  How can you forget such\na thing, my dear, dear one!\"\n\n\"She seems much the same as ever--an erring, careless, unreflecting\nfellow-creature,\" he said, continuing to pull on his boots.  \"What\nthose legal fellows have been playing at in London makes no\ndifference in my real relations to her.  If she was my wife while\nshe was away in Australia with another husband, she's my wife now.\"\n\n\"But she wasn't!  That's just what I hold!  There's the absurdity!--\nWell--you'll come straight back, after a few minutes, won't you,\ndear?  She is too low, too coarse for you to talk to long, Jude, and\nwas always!\"\n\n\"Perhaps I am coarse too, worse luck!  I have the germs of every\nhuman infirmity in me, I verily believe--that was why I saw it was\nso preposterous of me to think of being a curate.  I have cured\nmyself of drunkenness I think; but I never know in what new form a\nsuppressed vice will break out in me!  I do love you, Sue, though I\nhave danced attendance on you so long for such poor returns!  All\nthat's best and noblest in me loves you, and your freedom from\neverything that's gross has elevated me, and enabled me to do what\nI should never have dreamt myself capable of, or any man, a year\nor two ago.  It is all very well to preach about self-control, and\nthe wickedness of coercing a woman.  But I should just like a few\nvirtuous people who have condemned me in the past, about Arabella\nand other things, to have been in my tantalizing position with\nyou through these late weeks!--they'd believe, I think, that I\nhave exercised some little restraint in always giving in to your\nwishes--living here in one house, and not a soul between us.\"\n\n\"Yes, you have been good to me, Jude; I know you have, my dear\nprotector.\"\n\n\"Well--Arabella has appealed to me for help.  I must go out and speak\nto her, Sue, at least!\"\n\n\"I can't say any more!--Oh, if you must, you must!\" she said,\nbursting out into sobs that seemed to tear her heart.  \"I have\nnobody but you, Jude, and you are deserting me!  I didn't know you\nwere like this--I can't bear it, I can't!  If she were yours it\nwould be different!\"\n\n\"Or if you were.\"\n\n\"Very well then--if I must I must.  Since you will have it so, I\nagree!  I will be.  Only I didn't mean to!  And I didn't want to\nmarry again, either! ...  But, yes--I agree, I agree!  I do love you.\nI ought to have known that you would conquer in the long run, living\nlike this!\"\n\nShe ran across and flung her arms round his neck.  \"I am not a\ncold-natured, sexless creature, am I, for keeping you at such a\ndistance?  I am sure you don't think so!  Wait and see!  I do belong\nto you, don't I?  I give in!\"\n\n\"And I'll arrange for our marriage to-morrow, or as soon as ever you\nwish.\"\n\n\"Yes, Jude.\"\n\n\"Then I'll let her go,\" said he, embracing Sue softly.  \"I do feel\nthat it would be unfair to you to see her, and perhaps unfair to her.\nShe is not like you, my darling, and never was: it is only bare\njustice to say that.  Don't cry any more.  There; and there; and\nthere!\"  He kissed her on one side, and on the other, and in the\nmiddle, and rebolted the front door.\n\n\n\nThe next morning it was wet.\n\n\"Now, dear,\" said Jude gaily at breakfast; \"as this is Saturday\nI mean to call about the banns at once, so as to get the first\npublishing done to-morrow, or we shall lose a week.  Banns will do?\nWe shall save a pound or two.\"\n\nSue absently agreed to banns.  But her mind for the moment was\nrunning on something else.  A glow had passed away from her, and\ndepression sat upon her features.\n\n\"I feel I was wickedly selfish last night!\" she murmured.  \"It was\nsheer unkindness in me--or worse--to treat Arabella as I did.  I\ndidn't care about her being in trouble, and what she wished to tell\nyou!  Perhaps it was really something she was justified in telling\nyou.  That's some more of my badness, I suppose!  Love has its own\ndark morality when rivalry enters in--at least, mine has, if other\npeople's hasn't...  I wonder how she got on?  I hope she reached the\ninn all right, poor woman.\"\n\n\"Oh yes: she got on all right,\" said Jude placidly.\n\n\"I hope she wasn't shut out, and that she hadn't to walk the streets\nin the rain.  Do you mind my putting on my waterproof and going to\nsee if she got in?  I've been thinking of her all the morning.\"\n\n\"Well--is it necessary?  You haven't the least idea how Arabella is\nable to shift for herself.  Still, darling, if you want to go and\ninquire you can.\"\n\nThere was no limit to the strange and unnecessary penances which Sue\nwould meekly undertake when in a contrite mood; and this going to\nsee all sorts of extraordinary persons whose relation to her was\nprecisely of a kind that would have made other people shun them was\nher instinct ever, so that the request did not surprise him.\n\n\"And when you come back,\" he added, \"I'll be ready to go about the\nbanns.  You'll come with me?\"\n\nSue agreed, and went off under cloak and umbrella letting Jude kiss\nher freely, and returning his kisses in a way she had never done\nbefore.  Times had decidedly changed.  \"The little bird is caught at\nlast!\" she said, a sadness showing in her smile.\n\n\"No--only nested,\" he assured her.\n\nShe walked along the muddy street till she reached the public house\nmentioned by Arabella, which was not so very far off.  She was\ninformed that Arabella had not yet left, and in doubt how to announce\nherself so that her predecessor in Jude's affections would recognize\nher, she sent up word that a friend from Spring Street had called,\nnaming the place of Jude's residence.  She was asked to step\nupstairs, and on being shown into a room found that it was Arabella's\nbedroom, and that the latter had not yet risen.  She halted on the\nturn of her toe till Arabella cried from the bed, \"Come in and shut\nthe door,\" which Sue accordingly did.\n\nArabella lay facing the window, and did not at once turn her head:\nand Sue was wicked enough, despite her penitence, to wish for a\nmoment that Jude could behold her forerunner now, with the daylight\nfull upon her.  She may have seemed handsome enough in profile under\nthe lamps, but a frowsiness was apparent this morning; and the sight\nof her own fresh charms in the looking-glass made Sue's manner\nbright, till she reflected what a meanly sexual emotion this was in\nher, and hated herself for it.\n\n\"I've just looked in to see if you got back comfortably last night,\nthat's all,\" she said gently.  \"I was afraid afterwards that you\nmight have met with any mishap?\"\n\n\"Oh--how stupid this is!  I thought my visitor was--your friend--your\nhusband--Mrs. Fawley, as I suppose you call yourself?\" said Arabella,\nflinging her head back upon the pillows with a disappointed toss, and\nceasing to retain the dimple she had just taken the trouble to\nproduce.\n\n\"Indeed I don't,\" said Sue.\n\n\"Oh, I thought you might have, even if he's not really yours.\nDecency is decency, any hour of the twenty-four.\"\n\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" said Sue stiffly.  \"He is mine, if you\ncome to that!\"\n\n\"He wasn't yesterday.\"\n\nSue coloured roseate, and said, \"How do you know?\"\n\n\"From your manner when you talked to me at the door.  Well, my dear,\nyou've been quick about it, and I expect my visit last night helped\nit on--ha-ha!  But I don't want to get him away from you.\"\n\nSue looked out at the rain, and at the dirty toilet-cover, and at the\ndetached tail of Arabella's hair hanging on the looking-glass, just\nas it had done in Jude's time; and wished she had not come.  In the\npause there was a knock at the door, and the chambermaid brought in a\ntelegram for \"Mrs. Cartlett.\"\n\nArabella opened it as she lay, and her ruffled look disappeared.\n\n\"I am much obliged to you for your anxiety about me,\" she said\nblandly when the maid had gone; \"but it is not necessary you should\nfeel it.  My man finds he can't do without me after all, and agrees\nto stand by the promise to marry again over here that he has made me\nall along.  See here!  This is in answer to one from me.\"  She held\nout the telegram for Sue to read, but Sue did not take it.  \"He asks\nme to come back.  His little corner public in Lambeth would go to\npieces without me, he says.  But he isn't going to knock me about\nwhen he has had a drop, any more after we are spliced by English law\nthan before! ...  As for you, I should coax Jude to take me before\nthe parson straight off, and have done with it, if I were in your\nplace.  I say it as a friend, my dear.\"\n\n\"He's waiting to, any day,\" returned Sue, with frigid pride.\n\n\"Then let him, in Heaven's name.  Life with a man is more\nbusinesslike after it, and money matters work better.  And then, you\nsee, if you have rows, and he turns you out of doors, you can get the\nlaw to protect you, which you can't otherwise, unless he half-runs\nyou through with a knife, or cracks your noddle with a poker.  And\nif he bolts away from you--I say it friendly, as woman to woman, for\nthere's never any knowing what a man med do--you'll have the sticks\no' furniture, and won't be looked upon as a thief.  I shall marry my\nman over again, now he's willing, as there was a little flaw in the\nfirst ceremony.  In my telegram last night which this is an answer\nto, I told him I had almost made it up with Jude; and that frightened\nhim, I expect!  Perhaps I should quite have done it if it hadn't been\nfor you,\" she said laughing; \"and then how different our histories\nmight have been from to-day!  Never such a tender fool as Jude is if\na woman seems in trouble, and coaxes him a bit!  Just as he used to\nbe about birds and things.  However, as it happens, it is just as\nwell as if I had made it up, and I forgive you.  And, as I say, I'd\nadvise you to get the business legally done as soon as possible.\nYou'll find it an awful bother later on if you don't.\"\n\n\"I have told you he is asking me to marry him--to make our natural\nmarriage a legal one,\" said Sue, with yet more dignity.  \"It was\nquite by my wish that he didn't the moment I was free.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes--you are a oneyer too, like myself,\" said Arabella, eyeing\nher visitor with humorous criticism.  \"Bolted from your first, didn't\nyou, like me?\"\n\n\"Good morning!--I must go,\" said Sue hastily.\n\n\"And I, too, must up and off!\" replied the other, springing out of\nbed so suddenly that the soft parts of her person shook.  Sue jumped\naside in trepidation.  \"Lord, I am only a woman--not a six-foot\nsojer! ...  Just a moment, dear,\" she continued, putting her hand on\nSue's arm.  \"I really did want to consult Jude on a little matter of\nbusiness, as I told him.  I came about that more than anything else.\nWould he run up to speak to me at the station as I am going?  You\nthink not.  Well, I'll write to him about it.  I didn't want to write\nit, but never mind--I will.\"\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nWhen Sue reached home Jude was awaiting her at the door to take the\ninitial step towards their marriage.  She clasped his arm, and they\nwent along silently together, as true comrades oft-times do.  He saw\nthat she was preoccupied, and forbore to question her.\n\n\"Oh Jude--I've been talking to her,\" she said at last.  \"I wish I\nhadn't!  And yet it is best to be reminded of things.\"\n\n\"I hope she was civil.\"\n\n\"Yes.  I--I can't help liking her--just a little bit!  She's not\nan ungenerous nature; and I am so glad her difficulties have all\nsuddenly ended.\"  She explained how Arabella had been summoned back,\nand would be enabled to retrieve her position.  \"I was referring\nto our old question.  What Arabella has been saying to me has made\nme feel more than ever how hopelessly vulgar an institution legal\nmarriage is--a sort of trap to catch a man--I can't bear to think\nof it.  I wish I hadn't promised to let you put up the banns this\nmorning!\"\n\n\"Oh, don't mind me.  Any time will do for me.  I thought you might\nlike to get it over quickly, now.\"\n\n\"Indeed, I don't feel any more anxious now than I did before.\nPerhaps with any other man I might be a little anxious; but among the\nvery few virtues possessed by your family and mine, dear, I think I\nmay set staunchness.  So I am not a bit frightened about losing you,\nnow I really am yours and you really are mine.  In fact, I am easier\nin my mind than I was, for my conscience is clear about Richard, who\nnow has a right to his freedom.  I felt we were deceiving him\nbefore.\"\n\n\"Sue, you seem when you are like this to be one of the women of some\ngrand old civilization, whom I used to read about in my bygone,\nwasted, classical days, rather than a denizen of a mere Christian\ncountry.  I almost expect you to say at these times that you have\njust been talking to some friend whom you met in the Via Sacra,\nabout the latest news of Octavia or Livia; or have been listening to\nAspasia's eloquence, or have been watching Praxiteles chiselling away\nat his latest Venus, while Phryne made complaint that she was tired\nof posing.\"\n\nThey had now reached the house of the parish clerk.  Sue stood back,\nwhile her lover went up to the door.  His hand was raised to knock\nwhen she said: \"Jude!\"\n\nHe looked round.\n\n\"Wait a minute, would you mind?\"\n\nHe came back to her.\n\n\"Just let us think,\" she said timidly.  \"I had such a horrid dream\none night! ...  And Arabella--\"\n\n\"What did Arabella say to you?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, she said that when people were tied up you could get\nthe law of a man better if he beat you--and how when couples\nquarrelled...  Jude, do you think that when you must have me with\nyou by law, we shall be so happy as we are now?  The men and women\nof our family are very generous when everything depends upon their\ngoodwill, but they always kick against compulsion.  Don't you\ndread the attitude that insensibly arises out of legal obligation?\nDon't you think it is destructive to a passion whose essence is its\ngratuitousness?\"\n\n\"Upon my word, love, you are beginning to frighten me, too, with all\nthis foreboding!  Well, let's go back and think it over.\"\n\nHer face brightened.  \"Yes--so we will!\" said she.  And they turned\nfrom the clerk's door, Sue taking his arm and murmuring as they\nwalked on homeward:\n\n\n   Can you keep the bee from ranging,\n   Or the ring-dove's neck from changing?\n   No! Nor fetter'd love ...\n\n\nThey thought it over, or postponed thinking.  Certainly they\npostponed action, and seemed to live on in a dreamy paradise.\nAt the end of a fortnight or three weeks matters remained unadvanced,\nand no banns were announced to the ears of any Aldbrickham\ncongregation.\n\nWhilst they were postponing and postponing thus a letter and a\nnewspaper arrived before breakfast one morning from Arabella.\nSeeing the handwriting Jude went up to Sue's room and told her,\nand as soon as she was dressed she hastened down.  Sue opened the\nnewspaper; Jude the letter.  After glancing at the paper she held\nacross the first page to him with her finger on a paragraph; but he\nwas so absorbed in his letter that he did not turn awhile.\n\n\"Look!\" said she.\n\nHe looked and read.  The paper was one that circulated in South\nLondon only, and the marked advertisement was simply the announcement\nof a marriage at St. John's Church, Waterloo Road, under the names,\n\"CARTLETT--DONN\"; the united pair being Arabella and the inn-keeper.\n\n\"Well, it is satisfactory,\" said Sue complacently.  \"Though, after\nthis, it seems rather low to do likewise, and I am glad.  However,\nshe is provided for now in a way, I suppose, whatever her faults,\npoor thing.  It is nicer that we are able to think that, than to be\nuneasy about her.  I ought, too, to write to Richard and ask him how\nhe is getting on, perhaps?\"\n\nBut Jude's attention was still absorbed.  Having merely glanced\nat the announcement he said in a disturbed voice: \"Listen to this\nletter.  What shall I say or do?\"\n\n\n   THE THREE HORNS, LAMBETH.\n\n   DEAR JUDE (I won't be so distant as to call you Mr.\n   Fawley),--I send to-day a newspaper, from which useful\n   document you will learn that I was married over again to\n   Cartlett last Tuesday.  So that business is settled right\n   and tight at last.  But what I write about more particular\n   is that private affair I wanted to speak to you on when I\n   came down to Aldbrickham.  I couldn't very well tell it to\n   your lady friend, and should much have liked to let you\n   know it by word of mouth, as I could have explained better\n   than by letter.  The fact is, Jude, that, though I have\n   never informed you before, there was a boy born of our\n   marriage, eight months after I left you, when I was at\n   Sydney, living with my father and mother.  All that is\n   easily provable.  As I had separated from you before I\n   thought such a thing was going to happen,  and I was over\n   there, and our quarrel had been sharp, I did not think it\n   convenient to write about the birth.  I was then looking\n   out for a good situation, so my parents took the child,\n   and he has been with them ever since.  That was why I did\n   not mention it when I met you in Christminster, nor at\n   the law proceedings.  He is now of an intelligent age, of\n   course, and my mother and father have lately written to\n   say that, as they have rather a hard struggle over there,\n   and I am settled comfortably here, they don't see why\n   they should be encumbered with the child any longer, his\n   parents being alive.  I would have him with me here in\n   a moment, but he is not old enough to be of any use in\n   the bar nor will be for years and years, and naturally\n   Cartlett might think him in the way.  They have, however,\n   packed him off to me in charge of some friends who\n   happened to be coming home, and I must ask you to take\n   him when he arrives, for I don't know what to do with him.\n   He is lawfully yours, that I solemnly swear.  If anybody\n   says he isn't, call them brimstone liars, for my sake.\n   Whatever I may have done before or afterwards, I was\n   honest to you from the time we were married till I went\n   away, and I remain, yours, &c.,\n\n   ARABELLA CARTLETT.\n\n\nSue's look was one of dismay.  \"What will you do, dear?\" she asked\nfaintly.\n\nJude did not reply, and Sue watched him anxiously, with heavy\nbreaths.\n\n\"It hits me hard!\" said he in an under-voice. \"It MAY be true!\nI can't make it out.  Certainly, if his birth was exactly when\nshe says, he's mine.  I cannot think why she didn't tell me when\nI met her at Christminster, and came on here that evening with\nher! ...  Ah--I do remember now that she said something about having\na thing on her mind that she would like me to know, if ever we lived\ntogether again.\"\n\n\"The poor child seems to be wanted by nobody!\"  Sue replied, and her\neyes filled.\n\nJude had by this time come to himself.  \"What a view of life he\nmust have, mine or not mine!\" he said.  \"I must say that, if I were\nbetter off, I should not stop for a moment to think whose he might\nbe.  I would take him and bring him up.  The beggarly question of\nparentage--what is it, after all?  What does it matter, when you come\nto think of it, whether a child is yours by blood or not?  All the\nlittle ones of our time are collectively the children of us adults of\nthe time, and entitled to our general care.  That excessive regard of\nparents for their own children, and their dislike of other people's,\nis, like class-feeling, patriotism, save-your-own-soul-ism, and other\nvirtues, a mean exclusiveness at bottom.\"\n\nSue jumped up and kissed Jude with passionate devotion.  \"Yes--so\nit is, dearest!  And we'll have him here!  And if he isn't yours it\nmakes it all the better.  I do hope he isn't--though perhaps I ought\nnot to feel quite that!  If he isn't, I should like so much for us\nto have him as an adopted child!\"\n\n\"Well, you must assume about him what is most pleasing to you, my\ncurious little comrade!\" he said.  \"I feel that, anyhow, I don't like\nto leave the unfortunate little fellow to neglect.  Just think of\nhis life in a Lambeth pothouse, and all its evil influences, with a\nparent who doesn't want him, and has, indeed, hardly seen him, and\na stepfather who doesn't know him.  'Let the day perish wherein I\nwas born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child\nconceived!'  That's what the boy--MY boy, perhaps, will find himself\nsaying before long!\"\n\n\"Oh no!\"\n\n\"As I was the petitioner, I am really entitled to his custody, I\nsuppose.\"\n\n\"Whether or no, we must have him.  I see that.  I'll do the best I\ncan to be a mother to him, and we can afford to keep him somehow.\nI'll work harder.  I wonder when he'll arrive?\"\n\n\"In the course of a few weeks, I suppose.\"\n\n\"I wish--When shall we have courage to marry, Jude?\"\n\n\"Whenever you have it, I think I shall.  It remains with you\nentirely, dear.  Only say the word, and it's done.\"\n\n\"Before the boy comes?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"It would make a more natural home for him, perhaps,\" she murmured.\n\nJude thereupon wrote in purely formal terms to request that the boy\nshould be sent on to them as soon as he arrived, making no remark\nwhatever on the surprising nature of Arabella's information, nor\nvouchsafing a single word of opinion on the boy's paternity, nor on\nwhether, had he known all this, his conduct towards her would have\nbeen quite the same.\n\nIn the down-train that was timed to reach Aldbrickham station about\nten o'clock the next evening, a small, pale child's face could\nbe seen in the gloom of a third-class carriage.  He had large,\nfrightened eyes, and wore a white woollen cravat, over which a\nkey was suspended round his neck by a piece of common string: the\nkey attracting attention by its occasional shine in the lamplight.\nIn the band of his hat his half-ticket was stuck.  His eyes\nremained mostly fixed on the back of the seat opposite, and never\nturned to the window even when a station was reached and called.\nOn the other seat were two or three passengers, one of them a working\nwoman who held a basket on her lap, in which was a tabby kitten.\nThe woman opened the cover now and then, whereupon the kitten would\nput out its head, and indulge in playful antics.  At these the\nfellow-passengers laughed, except the solitary boy bearing the key\nand ticket, who, regarding the kitten with his saucer eyes, seemed\nmutely to say: \"All laughing comes from misapprehension.  Rightly\nlooked at, there is no laughable thing under the sun.\"\n\nOccasionally, at a stoppage, the guard would look into the compartment\nand say to the boy, \"All right, my man.  Your box is safe in the\nvan.\"  The boy would say, \"Yes,\" without animation, would try to\nsmile, and fail.\n\nHe was Age masquerading as Juvenility, and doing it so badly that\nhis real self showed through crevices.  A ground-swell from ancient\nyears of night seemed now and then to lift the child in this his\nmorning-life, when his face took a back view over some great Atlantic\nof Time, and appeared not to care about what it saw.\n\nWhen the other travellers closed their eyes, which they did one by\none--even the kitten curling itself up in the basket, weary of its\ntoo circumscribed play--the boy remained just as before.  He then\nseemed to be doubly awake, like an enslaved and dwarfed divinity,\nsitting passive and regarding his companions as if he saw their whole\nrounded lives rather than their immediate figures.\n\nThis was Arabella's boy.  With her usual carelessness, she had\npostponed writing to Jude about him till the eve of his landing,\nwhen she could absolutely postpone no longer, though she had known\nfor weeks of his approaching arrival, and had, as she truly said,\nvisited Aldbrickham mainly to reveal the boy's existence and his near\nhome-coming to Jude.  This very day on which she had received her\nformer husband's answer at some time in the afternoon, the child\nreached the London Docks, and the family in whose charge he had come,\nhaving put him into a cab for Lambeth and directed the cabman to his\nmother's house, bade him good-bye, and went their way.\n\nOn his arrival at the Three Horns, Arabella had looked him over with\nan expression that was as good as saying, \"You are very much what I\nexpected you to be,\" had given him a good meal, a little money, and,\nlate as it was getting, dispatched him to Jude by the next train,\nwishing her husband Cartlett, who was out, not to see him.\n\nThe train reached Aldbrickham, and the boy was deposited on the\nlonely platform beside his box.  The collector took his ticket, and,\nwith a meditative sense of the unfitness of things, asked him where\nhe was going by himself at that time of night.\n\n\"Going to Spring Street,\" said the little one impassively.\n\n\"Why, that's a long way from here; a'most out in the country; and the\nfolks will be gone to bed.\"\n\n\"I've got to go there.\"\n\n\"You must have a fly for your box.\"\n\n\"No. I must walk.\"\n\n\"Oh well: you'd better leave your box here and send for it.  There's\na 'bus goes half-way, but you'll have to walk the rest.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid.\"\n\n\"Why didn't your friends come to meet 'ee?\"\n\n\"I suppose they didn't know I was coming.\"\n\n\"Who is your friends?\"\n\n\"Mother didn't wish me to say.\"\n\n\"All I can do, then, is to take charge of this.  Now walk as fast as\nyou can.\"\n\nSaying nothing further the boy came out into the street, looking\nround to see that nobody followed or observed him.  When he\nhad walked some little distance he asked for the street of his\ndestination.  He was told to go straight on quite into the outskirts\nof the place.\n\nThe child fell into a steady mechanical creep which had in it an\nimpersonal quality--the movement of the wave, or of the breeze, or\nof the cloud.  He followed his directions literally, without an\ninquiring gaze at anything.  It could have been seen that the boy's\nideas of life were different from those of the local boys.  Children\nbegin with detail, and learn up to the general; they begin with the\ncontiguous, and gradually comprehend the universal.  The boy seemed\nto have begun with the generals of life, and never to have concerned\nhimself with the particulars.  To him the houses, the willows,\nthe obscure fields beyond, were apparently regarded not as brick\nresidences, pollards, meadows; but as human dwellings in the\nabstract, vegetation, and the wide dark world.\n\nHe found the way to the little lane, and knocked at the door of\nJude's house.  Jude had just retired to bed, and Sue was about to\nenter her chamber adjoining when she heard the knock and came down.\n\n\"Is this where Father lives?\" asked the child.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Mr. Fawley, that's his name.\"\n\nSue ran up to Jude's room and told him, and he hurried down as soon\nas he could, though to her impatience he seemed long.\n\n\"What--is it he--so soon?\" she asked as Jude came.\n\nShe scrutinized the child's features, and suddenly went away into the\nlittle sitting-room adjoining.  Jude lifted the boy to a level with\nhimself, keenly regarded him with gloomy tenderness, and telling him\nhe would have been met if they had known of his coming so soon, set\nhim provisionally in a chair whilst he went to look for Sue, whose\nsupersensitiveness was disturbed, as he knew.  He found her in the\ndark, bending over an arm-chair.  He enclosed her with his arm, and\nputting his face by hers, whispered, \"What's the matter?\"\n\n\"What Arabella says is true--true!  I see you in him!\"\n\n\"Well: that's one thing in my life as it should be, at any rate.\"\n\n\"But the other half of him is--SHE!  And that's what I can't bear!\nBut I ought to--I'll try to get used to it; yes, I ought!\"\n\n\"Jealous little Sue!  I withdraw all remarks about your sexlessness.\nNever mind!  Time may right things...  And Sue, darling; I have an\nidea!  We'll educate and train him with a view to the university.\nWhat I couldn't accomplish in my own person perhaps I can carry out\nthrough him?  They are making it easier for poor students now, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Oh you dreamer!\" said she, and holding his hand returned to the\nchild with him.  The boy looked at her as she had looked at him.\n\"Is it you who's my REAL mother at last?\" he inquired.\n\n\"Why?  Do I look like your father's wife?\"\n\n\"Well, yes; 'cept he seems fond of you, and you of him.  Can I call\nyou Mother?\"\n\nThen a yearning look came over the child and he began to cry.  Sue\nthereupon could not refrain from instantly doing likewise, being a\nharp which the least wind of emotion from another's heart could make\nto vibrate as readily as a radical stir in her own.\n\n\"You may call me Mother, if you wish to, my poor dear!\" she said,\nbending her cheek against his to hide her tears.\n\n\"What's this round your neck?\" asked Jude with affected calmness.\n\n\"The key of my box that's at the station.\"\n\nThey bustled about and got him some supper, and made him up a\ntemporary bed, where he soon fell asleep.  Both went and looked at\nhim as he lay.\n\n\"He called you Mother two or three times before he dropped off,\"\nmurmured Jude.  \"Wasn't it odd that he should have wanted to!\"\n\n\"Well--it was significant,\" said Sue.  \"There's more for us to think\nabout in that one little hungry heart than in all the stars of the\nsky...  I suppose, dear, we must pluck up courage, and get that\nceremony over?  It is no use struggling against the current, and I\nfeel myself getting intertwined with my kind.  Oh Jude, you'll love\nme dearly, won't you, afterwards?  I do want to be kind to this\nchild, and to be a mother to him; and our adding the legal form to\nour marriage might make it easier for me.\"\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nTheir next and second attempt thereat was more deliberately made,\nthough it was begun on the morning following the singular child's\narrival at their home.\n\nHim they found to be in the habit of sitting silent, his quaint and\nweird face set, and his eyes resting on things they did not see in\nthe substantial world.\n\n\"His face is like the tragic mask of Melpomene,\" said Sue.  \"What is\nyour name, dear?  Did you tell us?\"\n\n\"Little Father Time is what they always called me.  It is a nickname;\nbecause I look so aged, they say.\"\n\n\"And you talk so, too,\" said Sue tenderly.  \"It is strange, Jude,\nthat these preternaturally old boys almost always come from new\ncountries.  But what were you christened?\"\n\n\"I never was.\"\n\n\"Why was that?\"\n\n\"Because, if I died in damnation, 'twould save the expense of a\nChristian funeral.\"\n\n\"Oh--your name is not Jude, then?\" said his father with some\ndisappointment.\n\nThe boy shook his head.  \"Never heerd on it.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Sue quickly; \"since she was hating you all the\ntime!\"\n\n\"We'll have him christened,\" said Jude; and privately to Sue: \"The\nday we are married.\"  Yet the advent of the child disturbed him.\n\nTheir position lent them shyness, and having an impression that a\nmarriage at a superintendent registrar's office was more private than\nan ecclesiastical one, they decided to avoid a church this time.\nBoth Sue and Jude together went to the office of the district to give\nnotice: they had become such companions that they could hardly do\nanything of importance except in each other's company.\n\nJude Fawley signed the form of notice, Sue looking over his shoulder\nand watching his hand as it traced the words.  As she read the\nfour-square undertaking, never before seen by her, into which\nher own and Jude's names were inserted, and by which that very\nvolatile essence, their love for each other, was supposed to be\nmade permanent, her face seemed to grow painfully apprehensive.\n\"Names and Surnames of the Parties\"--(they were to be parties now,\nnot lovers, she thought). \"Condition\"--(a horrid idea)--\"Rank or\nOccupation\"--\"Age\"--\"Dwelling at\"--\"Length of Residence\"--\"Church or\nBuilding in which the Marriage is to be solemnized\"--\"District and\nCounty in which the Parties respectively dwell.\"\n\n\"It spoils the sentiment, doesn't it!\" she said on their way home.\n\"It seems making a more sordid business of it even than signing the\ncontract in a vestry.  There is a little poetry in a church.  But\nwe'll try to get through with it, dearest, now.\"\n\n\"We will.  'For what man is he that hath betrothed a wife and hath\nnot taken her?  Let him go and return unto his house, lest he\ndie in the battle, and another man take her.'  So said the Jewish\nlaw-giver.\"\n\n\"How you know the Scriptures, Jude!  You really ought to have been a\nparson.  I can only quote profane writers!\"\n\nDuring the interval before the issuing of the certificate, Sue, in her\nhousekeeping errands, sometimes walked past the office, and furtively\nglancing in saw affixed to the wall the notice of the purposed clinch\nto their union.  She could not bear its aspect.  Coming after her\nprevious experience of matrimony, all the romance of their attachment\nseemed to be starved away by placing her present case in the same\ncategory.  She was usually leading little Father Time by the hand,\nand fancied that people thought him hers, and regarded the intended\nceremony as the patching up of an old error.\n\nMeanwhile Jude decided to link his present with his past in some\nslight degree by inviting to the wedding the only person remaining on\nearth who was associated with his early life at Marygreen--the aged\nwidow Mrs. Edlin, who had been his great-aunt's friend and nurse in\nher last illness.  He hardly expected that she would come; but she\ndid, bringing singular presents, in the form of apples, jam, brass\nsnuffers, an ancient pewter dish, a warming-pan, and an enormous bag\nof goose feathers towards a bed.  She was allotted the spare room in\nJude's house, whither she retired early, and where they could hear\nher through the ceiling below, honestly saying the Lord's Prayer in\na loud voice, as the Rubric directed.\n\nAs, however, she could not sleep, and discovered that Sue and Jude\nwere still sitting up--it being in fact only ten o'clock--she dressed\nherself again and came down, and they all sat by the fire till a late\nhour--Father Time included; though, as he never spoke, they were\nhardly conscious of him.\n\n\"Well, I bain't set against marrying as your great-aunt was,\" said\nthe widow.  \"And I hope 'twill be a jocund wedding for ye in all\nrespects this time.  Nobody can hope it more, knowing what I do\nof your families, which is more, I suppose, than anybody else now\nliving.  For they have been unlucky that way, God knows.\"\n\nSue breathed uneasily.\n\n\"They was always good-hearted people, too--wouldn't kill a fly if\nthey knowed it,\" continued the wedding guest.  \"But things happened\nto thwart 'em, and if everything wasn't vitty they were upset.  No\ndoubt that's how he that the tale is told of came to do what 'a\ndid--if he WERE one of your family.\"\n\n\"What was that?\" said Jude.\n\n\"Well--that tale, ye know; he that was gibbeted just on the brow of\nthe hill by the Brown House--not far from the milestone between\nMarygreen and Alfredston, where the other road branches off.  But\nLord, 'twas in my grandfather's time; and it medn' have been one of\nyour folk at all.\"\n\n\"I know where the gibbet is said to have stood, very well,\" murmured\nJude.  \"But I never heard of this.  What--did this man--my ancestor\nand Sue's--kill his wife?\"\n\n\"'Twer not that exactly.  She ran away from him, with their child,\nto her friends; and while she was there the child died.  He wanted\nthe body, to bury it where his people lay, but she wouldn't give it\nup.  Her husband then came in the night with a cart, and broke into\nthe house to steal the coffin away; but he was catched, and being\nobstinate, wouldn't tell what he broke in for.  They brought it in\nburglary, and that's why he was hanged and gibbeted on Brown House\nHill.  His wife went mad after he was dead.  But it medn't be true\nthat he belonged to ye more than to me.\"\n\nA small slow voice rose from the shade of the fireside, as if out of\nthe earth: \"If I was you, Mother, I wouldn't marry Father!\"  It came\nfrom little Time, and they started, for they had forgotten him.\n\n\"Oh, it is only a tale,\" said Sue cheeringly.\n\nAfter this exhilarating tradition from the widow on the eve of\nthe solemnization they rose, and, wishing their guest good-night,\nretired.\n\nThe next morning Sue, whose nervousness intensified with the\nhours, took Jude privately into the sitting-room before starting.\n\"Jude, I want you to kiss me, as a lover, incorporeally,\" she said,\ntremulously nestling up to him, with damp lashes.  \"It won't be ever\nlike this any more, will it?  I wish we hadn't begun the business.\nBut I suppose we must go on.  How horrid that story was last night!\nIt spoilt my thoughts of to-day. It makes me feel as if a tragic doom\noverhung our family, as it did the house of Atreus.\"\n\n\"Or the house of Jeroboam,\" said the quondam theologian.\n\n\"Yes.  And it seems awful temerity in us two to go marrying!  I am\ngoing to vow to you in the same words I vowed in to my other husband,\nand you to me in the same as you used to your other wife; regardless\nof the deterrent lesson we were taught by those experiments!\"\n\n\"If you are uneasy I am made unhappy,\" said he.  \"I had hoped you\nwould feel quite joyful.  But if you don't, you don't. It is no use\npretending.  It is a dismal business to you, and that makes it so to\nme!\"\n\n\"It is unpleasantly like that other morning--that's all,\" she\nmurmured.  \"Let us go on now.\"\n\nThey started arm in arm for the office aforesaid, no witness\naccompanying them except the Widow Edlin.  The day was chilly and\ndull, and a clammy fog blew through the town from \"Royal-tower'd\nThame.\"  On the steps of the office there were the muddy foot-marks\nof people who had entered, and in the entry were damp umbrellas.\nWithin the office several persons were gathered, and our couple\nperceived that a marriage between a soldier and a young woman was\njust in progress.  Sue, Jude, and the widow stood in the background\nwhile this was going on, Sue reading the notices of marriage on the\nwall.  The room was a dreary place to two of their temperament,\nthough to its usual frequenters it doubtless seemed ordinary enough.\nLaw-books in musty calf covered one wall, and elsewhere were\npost-office directories, and other books of reference.  Papers in\npackets tied with red tape were pigeon-holed around, and some iron\nsafes filled a recess, while the bare wood floor was, like the\ndoor-step, stained by previous visitors.\n\nThe soldier was sullen and reluctant: the bride sad and timid; she\nwas soon, obviously, to become a mother, and she had a black eye.\nTheir little business was soon done, and the twain and their friends\nstraggled out, one of the witnesses saying casually to Jude and Sue\nin passing, as if he had known them before: \"See the couple just\ncome in?  Ha, ha!  That fellow is just out of gaol this morning.\nShe met him at the gaol gates, and brought him straight here.  She's\npaying for everything.\"\n\nSue turned her head and saw an ill-favoured man, closely cropped,\nwith a broad-faced, pock-marked woman on his arm, ruddy with liquor\nand the satisfaction of being on the brink of a gratified desire.\nThey jocosely saluted the outgoing couple, and went forward in front\nof Jude and Sue, whose diffidence was increasing.  The latter drew\nback and turned to her lover, her mouth shaping itself like that of\na child about to give way to grief:\n\n\"Jude--I don't like it here!  I wish we hadn't come!  The place gives\nme the horrors: it seems so unnatural as the climax of our love!\nI wish it had been at church, if it had to be at all.  It is not so\nvulgar there!\"\n\n\"Dear little girl,\" said Jude.  \"How troubled and pale you look!\"\n\n\"It must be performed here now, I suppose?\"\n\n\"No--perhaps not necessarily.\"\n\nHe spoke to the clerk, and came back.  \"No--we need not marry here or\nanywhere, unless we like, even now,\" he said.  \"We can be married in\na church, if not with the same certificate with another he'll give\nus, I think.  Anyhow, let us go out till you are calmer, dear, and I\ntoo, and talk it over.\"\n\nThey went out stealthily and guiltily, as if they had committed a\nmisdemeanour, closing the door without noise, and telling the widow,\nwho had remained in the entry, to go home and await them; that they\nwould call in any casual passers as witnesses, if necessary.  When\nin the street they turned into an unfrequented side alley where they\nwalked up and down as they had done long ago in the market-house at\nMelchester.\n\n\"Now, darling, what shall we do?  We are making a mess of it, it\nstrikes me.  Still, ANYTHING that pleases you will please me.\"\n\n\"But Jude, dearest, I am worrying you!  You wanted it to be there,\ndidn't you?\"\n\n\"Well, to tell the truth, when I got inside I felt as if I didn't\ncare much about it.  The place depressed me almost as much as it\ndid you--it was ugly.  And then I thought of what you had said this\nmorning as to whether we ought.\"\n\nThey walked on vaguely, till she paused, and her little voice began\nanew: \"It seems so weak, too, to vacillate like this!  And yet how\nmuch better than to act rashly a second time...  How terrible that\nscene was to me!  The expression in that flabby woman's face, leading\nher on to give herself to that gaol-bird, not for a few hours, as she\nwould, but for a lifetime, as she must.  And the other poor soul--to\nescape a nominal shame which was owing to the weakness of her\ncharacter, degrading herself to the real shame of bondage to a tyrant\nwho scorned her--a man whom to avoid for ever was her only chance of\nsalvation...  This is our parish church, isn't it?  This is where\nit would have to be, if we did it in the usual way?  A service or\nsomething seems to be going on.\"\n\nJude went up and looked in at the door.  \"Why--it is a wedding here\ntoo,\" he said.  \"Everybody seems to be on our tack to-day.\"\n\nSue said she supposed it was because Lent was just over, when there\nwas always a crowd of marriages.  \"Let us listen,\" she said, \"and\nfind how it feels to us when performed in a church.\"\n\nThey stepped in, and entered a back seat, and watched the proceedings\nat the altar.  The contracting couple appeared to belong to the\nwell-to-do middle class, and the wedding altogether was of ordinary\nprettiness and interest.  They could see the flowers tremble in the\nbride's hand, even at that distance, and could hear her mechanical\nmurmur of words whose meaning her brain seemed to gather not at all\nunder the pressure of her self-consciousness.  Sue and Jude listened,\nand severally saw themselves in time past going through the same form\nof self-committal.\n\n\"It is not the same to her, poor thing, as it would be to me doing it\nover again with my present knowledge,\" Sue whispered.  \"You see, they\nare fresh to it, and take the proceedings as a matter of course.\nBut having been awakened to its awful solemnity as we have, or at\nleast as I have, by experience, and to my own too squeamish feelings\nperhaps sometimes, it really does seem immoral in me to go and\nundertake the same thing again with open eyes.  Coming in here and\nseeing this has frightened me from a church wedding as much as the\nother did from a registry one...  We are a weak, tremulous pair,\nJude, and what others may feel confident in I feel doubts of--my\nbeing proof against the sordid conditions of a business contract\nagain!\"\n\nThen they tried to laugh, and went on debating in whispers the\nobject-lesson before them.  And Jude said he also thought they were\nboth too thin-skinned--that they ought never to have been born--much\nless have come together for the most preposterous of all joint\nventures for THEM--matrimony.\n\nHis betrothed shuddered; and asked him earnestly if he indeed\nfelt that they ought not to go in cold blood and sign that\nlife-undertaking again?  \"It is awful if you think we have found\nourselves not strong enough for it, and knowing this, are proposing\nto perjure ourselves,\" she said.\n\n\"I fancy I do think it--since you ask me,\" said Jude.  \"Remember I'll\ndo it if you wish, own darling.\"  While she hesitated he went on to\nconfess that, though he thought they ought to be able to do it, he\nfelt checked by the dread of incompetency just as she did--from their\npeculiarities, perhaps, because they were unlike other people.  \"We\nare horribly sensitive; that's really what's the matter with us,\nSue!\" he declared.\n\n\"I fancy more are like us than we think!\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know.  The intention of the contract is good, and\nright for many, no doubt; but in our case it may defeat its own ends\nbecause we are the queer sort of people we are--folk in whom domestic\nties of a forced kind snuff out cordiality and spontaneousness.\"\n\nSue still held that there was not much queer or exceptional in them:\nthat all were so.  \"Everybody is getting to feel as we do.  We are\na little beforehand, that's all.  In fifty, a hundred, years the\ndescendants of these two will act and feel worse than we.  They\nwill see weltering humanity still more vividly than we do now, as\n\n\n   Shapes like our own selves hideously multiplied,\n\n\nand will be afraid to reproduce them.\"\n\n\"What a terrible line of poetry! ... though I have felt it myself\nabout my fellow-creatures, at morbid times.\"\n\nThus they murmured on, till Sue said more brightly:\n\n\"Well--the general question is not our business, and why should we\nplague ourselves about it?  However different our reasons are, we come\nto the same conclusion: that for us particular two, an irrevocable\noath is risky.  Then, Jude, let us go home without killing our dream!\nYes?  How good you are, my friend: you give way to all my whims!\"\n\n\"They accord very much with my own.\"\n\nHe gave her a little kiss behind a pillar while the attention of\neverybody present was taken up in observing the bridal procession\nentering the vestry; and then they came outside the building.  By the\ndoor they waited till two or three carriages, which had gone away for\na while, returned, and the new husband and wife came into the open\ndaylight.  Sue sighed.\n\n\"The flowers in the bride's hand are sadly like the garland which\ndecked the heifers of sacrifice in old times!\"\n\n\"Still, Sue, it is no worse for the woman than for the man.  That's\nwhat some women fail to see, and instead of protesting against the\nconditions they protest against the man, the other victim; just as a\nwoman in a crowd will abuse the man who crushes against her, when he\nis only the helpless transmitter of the pressure put upon him.\"\n\n\"Yes--some are like that, instead of uniting with the man against\nthe common enemy, coercion.\"  The bride and bridegroom had by this\ntime driven off, and the two moved away with the rest of the idlers.\n\"No--don't let's do it,\" she continued.  \"At least, just now.\"\n\nThey reached home, and passing the window arm in arm saw the widow\nlooking out at them.  \"Well,\" cried their guest when they entered, \"I\nsaid to myself when I zeed ye coming so loving up to the door, 'They\nmade up their minds at last, then!'\"\n\nThey briefly hinted that they had not.\n\n\"What--and ha'n't ye really done it?  Chok' it all, that I should\nhave lived to see a good old saying like 'marry in haste and repent\nat leisure' spoiled like this by you two!  'Tis time I got back again\nto Marygreen--sakes if tidden--if this is what the new notions be\nleading us to!  Nobody thought o' being afeard o' matrimony in my\ntime, nor of much else but a cannon-ball or empty cupboard!  Why when\nI and my poor man were married we thought no more o't than of a game\no' dibs!\"\n\n\"Don't tell the child when he comes in,\" whispered Sue nervously.\n\"He'll think it has all gone on right, and it will be better that he\nshould not be surprised and puzzled.  Of course it is only put off\nfor reconsideration.  If we are happy as we are, what does it matter\nto anybody?\"\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nThe purpose of a chronicler of moods and deeds does not require him\nto express his personal views upon the grave controversy above given.\nThat the twain were happy--between their times of sadness--was\nindubitable.  And when the unexpected apparition of Jude's child\nin the house had shown itself to be no such disturbing event as it\nhad looked, but one that brought into their lives a new and tender\ninterest of an ennobling and unselfish kind, it rather helped than\ninjured their happiness.\n\nTo be sure, with such pleasing anxious beings as they were, the boy's\ncoming also brought with it much thought for the future, particularly\nas he seemed at present to be singularly deficient in all the usual\nhopes of childhood.  But the pair tried to dismiss, for a while at\nleast, a too strenuously forward view.\n\nThere is in Upper Wessex an old town of nine or ten thousand souls;\nthe town may be called Stoke-Barehills.  It stands with its gaunt,\nunattractive, ancient church, and its new red brick suburb, amid\nthe open, chalk-soiled cornlands, near the middle of an imaginary\ntriangle which has for its three corners the towns of Aldbrickham\nand Wintoncester, and the important military station of Quartershot.\nThe great western highway from London passes through it, near a point\nwhere the road branches into two, merely to unite again some twenty\nmiles further westward.  Out of this bifurcation and reunion there\nused to arise among wheeled travellers, before railway days, endless\nquestions of choice between the respective ways.  But the question\nis now as dead as the scot-and-lot freeholder, the road waggoner,\nand the mail coachman who disputed it; and probably not a single\ninhabitant of Stoke-Barehills is now even aware that the two roads\nwhich part in his town ever meet again; for nobody now drives up and\ndown the great western highway dally.\n\nThe most familiar object in Stoke-Barehills nowadays is its cemetery,\nstanding among some picturesque medi\u00c3\u00a6val ruins beside the railway;\nthe modern chapels, modern tombs, and modern shrubs having a look of\nintrusiveness amid the crumbling and ivy-covered decay of the ancient\nwalls.\n\nOn a certain day, however, in the particular year which has now been\nreached by this narrative--the month being early June--the features\nof the town excite little interest, though many visitors arrive by\nthe trains; some down-trains, in especial, nearly emptying themselves\nhere.  It is the week of the Great Wessex Agricultural Show, whose\nvast encampment spreads over the open outskirts of the town like\nthe tents of an investing army.  Rows of marquees, huts, booths,\npavilions, arcades, porticoes--every kind of structure short of\na permanent one--cover the green field for the space of a square\nhalf-mile, and the crowds of arrivals walk through the town in\na mass, and make straight for the exhibition ground.  The way\nthereto is lined with shows, stalls, and hawkers on foot, who make\na market-place of the whole roadway to the show proper, and lead\nsome of the improvident to lighten their pockets appreciably before\nthey reach the gates of the exhibition they came expressly to see.\n\nIt is the popular day, the shilling day, and of the fast arriving\nexcursion trains two from different directions enter the two\ncontiguous railway stations at almost the same minute.  One, like\nseveral which have preceded it, comes from London: the other by a\ncross-line from Aldbrickham; and from the London train alights a\ncouple; a short, rather bloated man, with a globular stomach and\nsmall legs, resembling a top on two pegs, accompanied by a woman of\nrather fine figure and rather red face, dressed in black material,\nand covered with beads from bonnet to skirt, that made her glisten\nas if clad in chain-mail.\n\nThey cast their eyes around.  The man was about to hire a fly as some\nothers had done, when the woman said, \"Don't be in such a hurry,\nCartlett.  It isn't so very far to the show-yard.  Let us walk down\nthe street into the place.  Perhaps I can pick up a cheap bit of\nfurniture or old china.  It is years since I was here--never since\nI lived as a girl at Aldbrickham, and used to come across for a trip\nsometimes with my young man.\"\n\n\"You can't carry home furniture by excursion train,\" said, in a thick\nvoice, her husband, the landlord of The Three Horns, Lambeth; for\nthey had both come down from the tavern in that \"excellent, densely\npopulated, gin-drinking neighbourhood,\" which they had occupied ever\nsince the advertisement in those words had attracted them thither.\nThe configuration of the landlord showed that he, too, like his\ncustomers, was becoming affected by the liquors he retailed.\n\n\"Then I'll get it sent, if I see any worth having,\" said his wife.\n\nThey sauntered on, but had barely entered the town when her attention\nwas attracted by a young couple leading a child, who had come out\nfrom the second platform, into which the train from Aldbrickham had\nsteamed.  They were walking just in front of the inn-keepers.\n\n\"Sakes alive!\" said Arabella.\n\n\"What's that?\" said Cartlett.\n\n\"Who do you think that couple is?  Don't you recognize the man?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Not from the photos I have showed you?\"\n\n\"Is it Fawley?\"\n\n\"Yes--of course.\"\n\n\"Oh, well.  I suppose he was inclined for a little sight-seeing like\nthe rest of us.\"  Cartlett's interest in Jude whatever it might have\nbeen when Arabella was new to him, had plainly flagged since her\ncharms and her idiosyncrasies, her supernumerary hair-coils, and her\noptional dimples, were becoming as a tale that is told.\n\nArabella so regulated her pace and her husband's as to keep just in\nthe rear of the other three, which it was easy to do without notice\nin such a stream of pedestrians.  Her answers to Cartlett's remarks\nwere vague and slight, for the group in front interested her more\nthan all the rest of the spectacle.\n\n\"They are rather fond of one another and of their child, seemingly,\"\ncontinued the publican.\n\n\"THEIR child!  'Tisn't their child,\" said Arabella with a curious,\nsudden covetousness.  \"They haven't been married long enough for it\nto be theirs!\"\n\nBut although the smouldering maternal instinct was strong enough\nin her to lead her to quash her husband's conjecture, she was not\ndisposed on second thoughts to be more candid than necessary.  Mr.\nCartlett had no other idea than that his wife's child by her first\nhusband was with his grandparents at the Antipodes.\n\n\"Oh I suppose not.  She looks quite a girl.\"\n\n\"They are only lovers, or lately married, and have the child in\ncharge, as anybody can see.\"\n\nAll continued to move ahead.  The unwitting Sue and Jude, the couple\nin question, had determined to make this agricultural exhibition\nwithin twenty miles of their own town the occasion of a day's\nexcursion which should combine exercise and amusement with\ninstruction, at small expense.  Not regardful of themselves alone,\nthey had taken care to bring Father Time, to try every means of\nmaking him kindle and laugh like other boys, though he was to\nsome extent a hindrance to the delightfully unreserved intercourse\nin their pilgrimages which they so much enjoyed.  But they soon\nceased to consider him an observer, and went along with that tender\nattention to each other which the shyest can scarcely disguise, and\nwhich these, among entire strangers as they imagined, took less\ntrouble to disguise than they might have done at home.  Sue, in her\nnew summer clothes, flexible and light as a bird, her little thumb\nstuck up by the stem of her white cotton sunshade, went along as if\nshe hardly touched ground, and as if a moderately strong puff of wind\nwould float her over the hedge into the next field.  Jude, in his\nlight grey holiday-suit, was really proud of her companionship, not\nmore for her external attractiveness than for her sympathetic words\nand ways.  That complete mutual understanding, in which every glance\nand movement was as effectual as speech for conveying intelligence\nbetween them, made them almost the two parts of a single whole.\n\nThe pair with their charge passed through the turnstiles, Arabella\nand her husband not far behind them.  When inside the enclosure the\npublican's wife could see that the two ahead began to take trouble\nwith the youngster, pointing out and explaining the many objects of\ninterest, alive and dead; and a passing sadness would touch their\nfaces at their every failure to disturb his indifference.\n\n\"How she sticks to him!\" said Arabella.  \"Oh no--I fancy they are not\nmarried, or they wouldn't be so much to one another as that...  I\nwonder!\"\n\n\"But I thought you said he did marry her?\"\n\n\"I heard he was going to--that's all, going to make another attempt,\nafter putting it off once or twice...  As far as they themselves are\nconcerned they are the only two in the show.  I should be ashamed of\nmaking myself so silly if I were he!\"\n\n\"I don't see as how there's anything remarkable in their behaviour.\nI should never have noticed their being in love, if you hadn't said\nso.\"\n\n\"You never see anything,\" she rejoined.  Nevertheless Cartlett's view\nof the lovers' or married pair's conduct was undoubtedly that of the\ngeneral crowd, whose attention seemed to be in no way attracted by\nwhat Arabella's sharpened vision discerned.\n\n\"He's charmed by her as if she were some fairy!\" continued Arabella.\n\"See how he looks round at her, and lets his eyes rest on her.  I am\ninclined to think that she don't care for him quite so much as he\ndoes for her.  She's not a particular warm-hearted creature to my\nthinking, though she cares for him pretty middling much--as much as\nshe's able to; and he could make her heart ache a bit if he liked to\ntry--which he's too simple to do.  There--now they are going across\nto the cart-horse sheds.  Come along.\"\n\n\"I don't want to see the cart-horses.  It is no business of ours to\nfollow these two.  If we have come to see the show let us see it in\nour own way, as they do in theirs.\"\n\n\"Well--suppose we agree to meet somewhere in an hour's time--say at\nthat refreshment tent over there, and go about independent?  Then you\ncan look at what you choose to, and so can I.\"\n\nCartlett was not loath to agree to this, and they parted--he\nproceeding to the shed where malting processes were being exhibited,\nand Arabella in the direction taken by Jude and Sue.  Before,\nhowever, she had regained their wake a laughing face met her own,\nand she was confronted by Anny, the friend of her girlhood.\n\nAnny had burst out in hearty laughter at the mere fact of the chance\nencounter.  \"I am still living down there,\" she said, as soon as\nshe was composed.  \"I am soon going to be married, but my intended\ncouldn't come up here to-day.  But there's lots of us come by\nexcursion, though I've lost the rest of 'em for the present.\"\n\n\"Have you met Jude and his young woman, or wife, or whatever she is?\nI saw 'em by now.\"\n\n\"No. Not a glimpse of un for years!\"\n\n\"Well, they are close by here somewhere.  Yes--there they are--by\nthat grey horse!\"\n\n\"Oh, that's his present young woman--wife did you say?  Has he\nmarried again?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"She's pretty, isn't she!\"\n\n\"Yes--nothing to complain of; or jump at.  Not much to depend on,\nthough; a slim, fidgety little thing like that.\"\n\n\"He's a nice-looking chap, too!  You ought to ha' stuck to un,\nArabella.\"\n\n\"I don't know but I ought,\" murmured she.\n\nAnny laughed.  \"That's you, Arabella!  Always wanting another man\nthan your own.\"\n\n\"Well, and what woman don't I should like to know?  As for that body\nwith him--she don't know what love is--at least what I call love!  I\ncan see in her face she don't.\"\n\n\"And perhaps, Abby dear, you don't know what she calls love.\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't wish to! ...  Ah--they are making for the art\ndepartment.  I should like to see some pictures myself.  Suppose\nwe go that way?--  Why, if all Wessex isn't here, I verily believe!\nThere's Dr. Vilbert.  Haven't seen him for years, and he's not\nlooking a day older than when I used to know him.  How do you do,\nPhysician?  I was just saying that you don't look a day older than\nwhen you knew me as a girl.\"\n\n\"Simply the result of taking my own pills regular, ma'am. Only two\nand threepence a box--warranted efficacious by the Government stamp.\nNow let me advise you to purchase the same immunity from the ravages\nof time by following my example?  Only two-and-three.\"\n\nThe physician had produced a box from his waistcoat pocket, and\nArabella was induced to make the purchase.\n\n\"At the same time,\" continued he, when the pills were paid for, \"you\nhave the advantage of me, Mrs.--  Surely not Mrs. Fawley, once Miss\nDonn, of the vicinity of Marygreen?\"\n\n\"Yes.  But Mrs. Cartlett now.\"\n\n\"Ah--you lost him, then?  Promising young fellow!  A pupil of mine,\nyou know.  I taught him the dead languages.  And believe me, he soon\nknew nearly as much as I.\"\n\n\"I lost him; but not as you think,\" said Arabella dryly.  \"The\nlawyers untied us.  There he is, look, alive and lusty; along with\nthat young woman, entering the art exhibition.\"\n\n\"Ah--dear me!  Fond of her, apparently.\"\n\n\"They SAY they are cousins.\"\n\n\"Cousinship is a great convenience to their feelings, I should say?\"\n\n\"Yes.  So her husband thought, no doubt, when he divorced\nher...  Shall we look at the pictures, too?\"\n\nThe trio followed across the green and entered.  Jude and Sue, with\nthe child, unaware of the interest they were exciting, had gone\nup to a model at one end of the building, which they regarded\nwith considerable attention for a long while before they went\non.  Arabella and her friends came to it in due course, and the\ninscription it bore was: \"Model of Cardinal College, Christminster;\nby J. Fawley and S. F. M. Bridehead.\"\n\n\"Admiring their own work,\" said Arabella.  \"How like Jude--always\nthinking of colleges and Christminster, instead of attending to his\nbusiness!\"\n\nThey glanced cursorily at the pictures, and proceeded to the\nband-stand.  When they had stood a little while listening to the\nmusic of the military performers, Jude, Sue, and the child came up on\nthe other side.  Arabella did not care if they should recognize her;\nbut they were too deeply absorbed in their own lives, as translated\ninto emotion by the military band, to perceive her under her beaded\nveil.  She walked round the outside of the listening throng, passing\nbehind the lovers, whose movements had an unexpected fascination for\nher to-day.  Scrutinizing them narrowly from the rear she noticed\nthat Jude's hand sought Sue's as they stood, the two standing close\ntogether so as to conceal, as they supposed, this tacit expression\nof their mutual responsiveness.\n\n\"Silly fools--like two children!\"  Arabella whispered to herself\nmorosely, as she rejoined her companions, with whom she preserved a\npreoccupied silence.\n\nAnny meanwhile had jokingly remarked to Vilbert on Arabella's\nhankering interest in her first husband.\n\n\"Now,\" said the physician to Arabella, apart; \"do you want anything\nsuch as this, Mrs. Cartlett?  It is not compounded out of my regular\npharmacopoeia, but I am sometimes asked for such a thing.\"  He\nproduced a small phial of clear liquid.  \"A love-philtre, such as was\nused by the ancients with great effect.  I found it out by study of\ntheir writings, and have never known it to fail.\"\n\n\"What is it made of?\" asked Arabella curiously.\n\n\"Well--a distillation of the juices of doves' hearts--otherwise\npigeons'--is one of the ingredients.  It took nearly a hundred hearts\nto produce that small bottle full.\"\n\n\"How do you get pigeons enough?\"\n\n\"To tell a secret, I get a piece of rock-salt, of which pigeons are\ninordinately fond, and place it in a dovecot on my roof.  In a few\nhours the birds come to it from all points of the compass--east,\nwest, north, and south--and thus I secure as many as I require.\nYou use the liquid by contriving that the desired man shall take\nabout ten drops of it in his drink.  But remember, all this is told\nyou because I gather from your questions that you mean to be a\npurchaser.  You must keep faith with me?\"\n\n\"Very well--I don't mind a bottle--to give some friend or other to\ntry it on her young man.\"  She produced five shillings, the price\nasked, and slipped the phial in her capacious bosom.  Saying\npresently that she was due at an appointment with her husband, she\nsauntered away towards the refreshment bar, Jude, his companion, and\nthe child having gone on to the horticultural tent, where Arabella\ncaught a glimpse of them standing before a group of roses in bloom.\n\nShe waited a few minutes observing them, and then proceeded to join\nher spouse with no very amiable sentiments.  She found him seated on\na stool by the bar, talking to one of the gaily dressed maids who had\nserved him with spirits.\n\n\"I should think you had enough of this business at home!\" Arabella\nremarked gloomily.  \"Surely you didn't come fifty miles from your own\nbar to stick in another?  Come, take me round the show, as other men\ndo their wives!  Dammy, one would think you were a young bachelor,\nwith nobody to look after but yourself!\"\n\n\"But we agreed to meet here; and what could I do but wait?\"\n\n\"Well, now we have met, come along,\" she returned, ready to quarrel\nwith the sun for shining on her.  And they left the tent together,\nthis pot-bellied man and florid woman, in the antipathetic,\nrecriminatory mood of the average husband and wife of Christendom.\n\nIn the meantime the more exceptional couple and the boy still\nlingered in the pavilion of flowers--an enchanted palace to their\nappreciative taste--Sue's usually pale cheeks reflecting the pink of\nthe tinted roses at which she gazed; for the gay sights, the air, the\nmusic, and the excitement of a day's outing with Jude had quickened\nher blood and made her eyes sparkle with vivacity.  She adored roses,\nand what Arabella had witnessed was Sue detaining Jude almost against\nhis will while she learnt the names of this variety and that, and put\nher face within an inch of their blooms to smell them.\n\n\"I should like to push my face quite into them--the dears!\" she had\nsaid.  \"But I suppose it is against the rules to touch them--isn't\nit, Jude?\"\n\n\"Yes, you baby,\" said he: and then playfully gave her a little push,\nso that her nose went among the petals.\n\n\"The policeman will be down on us, and I shall say it was my\nhusband's fault!\"\n\nThen she looked up at him, and smiled in a way that told so much to\nArabella.\n\n\"Happy?\" he murmured.\n\nShe nodded.\n\n\"Why?  Because you have come to the great Wessex Agricultural\nShow--or because WE have come?\"\n\n\"You are always trying to make me confess to all sorts of\nabsurdities.  Because I am improving my mind, of course, by seeing\nall these steam-ploughs, and threshing-machines, and chaff-cutters,\nand cows, and pigs, and sheep.\"\n\nJude was quite content with a baffle from his ever evasive companion.\nBut when he had forgotten that he had put the question, and because\nhe no longer wished for an answer, she went on: \"I feel that we have\nreturned to Greek joyousness, and have blinded ourselves to sickness\nand sorrow, and have forgotten what twenty-five centuries have taught\nthe race since their time, as one of your Christminster luminaries\nsays...  There is one immediate shadow, however--only one.\"  And\nshe looked at the aged child, whom, though they had taken him to\neverything likely to attract a young intelligence, they had utterly\nfailed to interest.\n\nHe knew what they were saying and thinking.  \"I am very, very sorry,\nFather and Mother,\" he said.  \"But please don't mind!--I can't help\nit.  I should like the flowers very very much, if I didn't keep on\nthinking they'd be all withered in a few days!\"\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nThe unnoticed lives that the pair had hitherto led began, from the\nday of the suspended wedding onwards, to be observed and discussed by\nother persons than Arabella.  The society of Spring Street and the\nneighbourhood generally did not understand, and probably could not\nhave been made to understand, Sue and Jude's private minds, emotions,\npositions, and fears.  The curious facts of a child coming to them\nunexpectedly, who called Jude \"Father,\" and Sue \"Mother,\" and a hitch\nin a marriage ceremony intended for quietness to be performed at a\nregistrar's office, together with rumours of the undefended cases in\nthe law-courts, bore only one translation to plain minds.\n\nLittle Time--for though he was formally turned into \"Jude,\" the apt\nnickname stuck to him--would come home from school in the evening,\nand repeat inquiries and remarks that had been made to him by the\nother boys; and cause Sue, and Jude when he heard them, a great deal\nof pain and sadness.\n\nThe result was that shortly after the attempt at the registrar's the\npair went off--to London it was believed--for several days, hiring\nsomebody to look to the boy.  When they came back they let it be\nunderstood indirectly, and with total indifference and weariness\nof mien, that they were legally married at last.  Sue, who had\npreviously been called Mrs. Bridehead now openly adopted the name of\nMrs. Fawley.  Her dull, cowed, and listless manner for days seemed\nto substantiate all this.\n\nBut the mistake (as it was called) of their going away so secretly\nto do the business, kept up much of the mystery of their lives; and\nthey found that they made not such advances with their neighbours as\nthey had expected to do thereby.  A living mystery was not much less\ninteresting than a dead scandal.\n\nThe baker's lad and the grocer's boy, who at first had used to lift\ntheir hats gallantly to Sue when they came to execute their errands,\nin these days no longer took the trouble to render her that homage,\nand the neighbouring artizans' wives looked straight along the\npavement when they encountered her.\n\nNobody molested them, it is true; but an oppressive atmosphere began\nto encircle their souls, particularly after their excursion to the\nshow, as if that visit had brought some evil influence to bear on\nthem.  And their temperaments were precisely of a kind to suffer from\nthis atmosphere, and to be indisposed to lighten it by vigorous and\nopen statements.  Their apparent attempt at reparation had come too\nlate to be effective.\n\nThe headstone and epitaph orders fell off: and two or three months\nlater, when autumn came, Jude perceived that he would have to return\nto journey-work again, a course all the more unfortunate just now,\nin that he had not as yet cleared off the debt he had unavoidably\nincurred in the payment of the law-costs of the previous year.\n\nOne evening he sat down to share the common meal with Sue and the\nchild as usual.  \"I am thinking,\" he said to her, \"that I'll hold on\nhere no longer.  The life suits us, certainly; but if we could get\naway to a place where we are unknown, we should be lighter hearted,\nand have a better chance.  And so I am afraid we must break it up\nhere, however awkward for you, poor dear!\"\n\nSue was always much affected at a picture of herself as an object of\npity, and she saddened.\n\n\"Well--I am not sorry,\" said she presently.  \"I am much depressed\nby the way they look at me here.  And you have been keeping on this\nhouse and furniture entirely for me and the boy!  You don't want\nit yourself, and the expense is unnecessary.  But whatever we do,\nwherever we go, you won't take him away from me, Jude dear?  I could\nnot let him go now!  The cloud upon his young mind makes him so\npathetic to me; I do hope to lift it some day!  And he loves me so.\nYou won't take him away from me?\"\n\n\"Certainly I won't, dear little girl!  We'll get nice lodgings,\nwherever we go.  I shall be moving about probably--getting a job\nhere and a job there.\"\n\n\"I shall do something too, of course, till--till--  Well, now I can't\nbe useful in the lettering it behoves me to turn my hand to something\nelse.\"\n\n\"Don't hurry about getting employment,\" he said regretfully.  \"I\ndon't want you to do that.  I wish you wouldn't, Sue.  The boy and\nyourself are enough for you to attend to.\"\n\nThere was a knock at the door, and Jude answered it.  Sue could hear\nthe conversation:\n\n\"Is Mr. Fawley at home? ...  Biles and Willis, the building\ncontractors, sent me to know if you'll undertake the relettering\nof the ten commandments in a little church they've been restoring\nlately in the country near here.\"\n\nJude reflected, and said he could undertake it.\n\n\"It is not a very artistic job,\" continued the messenger.  \"The\nclergyman is a very old-fashioned chap, and he has refused to let\nanything more be done to the church than cleaning and repairing.\"\n\n\"Excellent old man!\" said Sue to herself, who was sentimentally\nopposed to the horrors of over-restoration.\n\n\"The Ten Commandments are fixed to the east end,\" the messenger went\non, \"and they want doing up with the rest of the wall there, since\nhe won't have them carted off as old materials belonging to the\ncontractor in the usual way of the trade.\"\n\nA bargain as to terms was struck, and Jude came indoors.  \"There, you\nsee,\" he said cheerfully.  \"One more job yet, at any rate, and you\ncan help in it--at least you can try.  We shall have all the church\nto ourselves, as the rest of the work is finished.\"\n\nNext day Jude went out to the church, which was only two miles\noff.  He found that what the contractor's clerk had said was true.\nThe tables of the Jewish law towered sternly over the utensils of\nChristian grace, as the chief ornament of the chancel end, in the\nfine dry style of the last century.  And as their framework was\nconstructed of ornamental plaster they could not be taken down for\nrepair.  A portion, crumbled by damp, required renewal; and when\nthis had been done, and the whole cleansed, he began to renew the\nlettering.  On the second morning Sue came to see what assistance\nshe could render, and also because they liked to be together.\n\nThe silence and emptiness of the building gave her confidence, and,\nstanding on a safe low platform erected by Jude, which she was\nnevertheless timid at mounting, she began painting in the letters\nof the first Table while he set about mending a portion of the\nsecond.  She was quite pleased at her powers; she had acquired them\nin the days she painted illumined texts for the church-fitting shop\nat Christminster.  Nobody seemed likely to disturb them; and the\npleasant twitter of birds, and rustle of October leafage, came in\nthrough an open window, and mingled with their talk.\n\nThey were not, however, to be left thus snug and peaceful for long.\nAbout half-past twelve there came footsteps on the gravel without.\nThe old vicar and his churchwarden entered, and, coming up to see\nwhat was being done, seemed surprised to discover that a young woman\nwas assisting.  They passed on into an aisle, at which time the door\nagain opened, and another figure entered--a small one, that of little\nTime, who was crying.  Sue had told him where he might find her\nbetween school-hours, if he wished.  She came down from her perch,\nand said, \"What's the matter, my dear?\"\n\n\"I couldn't stay to eat my dinner in school, because they said--\"\nHe described how some boys had taunted him about his nominal mother,\nand Sue, grieved, expressed her indignation to Jude aloft.  The child\nwent into the churchyard, and Sue returned to her work.  Meanwhile\nthe door had opened again, and there shuffled in with a businesslike\nair the white-aproned woman who cleaned the church.  Sue recognized\nher as one who had friends in Spring Street, whom she visited.  The\nchurch-cleaner looked at Sue, gaped, and lifted her hands; she had\nevidently recognized Jude's companion as the latter had recognized\nher.  Next came two ladies, and after talking to the charwoman they\nalso moved forward, and as Sue stood reaching upward, watched her\nhand tracing the letters, and critically regarded her person in\nrelief against the white wall, till she grew so nervous that she\ntrembled visibly.\n\nThey went back to where the others were standing, talking in\nundertones: and one said--Sue could not hear which--\"She's his wife,\nI suppose?\"\n\n\"Some say Yes: some say No,\" was the reply from the charwoman.\n\n\"Not?  Then she ought to be, or somebody's--that's very clear!\"\n\n\"They've only been married a very few weeks, whether or no.\"\n\n\"A strange pair to be painting the Two Tables!  I wonder Biles and\nWillis could think of such a thing as hiring those!\"\n\nThe churchwarden supposed that Biles and Willis knew of nothing\nwrong, and then the other, who had been talking to the old woman,\nexplained what she meant by calling them strange people.\n\nThe probable drift of the subdued conversation which followed was\nmade plain by the churchwarden breaking into an anecdote, in a voice\nthat everybody in the church could hear, though obviously suggested\nby the present situation:\n\n\"Well, now, it is a curious thing, but my grandfather told me a\nstrange tale of a most immoral case that happened at the painting of\nthe Commandments in a church out by Gaymead--which is quite within a\nwalk of this one.  In them days Commandments were mostly done in gilt\nletters on a black ground, and that's how they were out where I say,\nbefore the owld church was rebuilded.  It must have been somewhere\nabout a hundred years ago that them Commandments wanted doing up just\nas ours do here, and they had to get men from Aldbrickham to do 'em.\nNow they wished to get the job finished by a particular Sunday, so\nthe men had to work late Saturday night, against their will, for\novertime was not paid then as 'tis now.  There was no true religion\nin the country at that date, neither among pa'sons, clerks, nor\npeople, and to keep the men up to their work the vicar had to let 'em\nhave plenty of drink during the afternoon.  As evening drawed on they\nsent for some more themselves; rum, by all account.  It got later and\nlater, and they got more and more fuddled, till at last they went\na-putting their rum-bottle and rummers upon the communion table, and\ndrawed up a trestle or two, and sate round comfortable and poured\nout again right hearty bumpers.  No sooner had they tossed off their\nglasses than, so the story goes, they fell down senseless, one and\nall.  How long they bode so they didn't know, but when they came\nto themselves there was a terrible thunder-storm a-raging, and\nthey seemed to see in the gloom a dark figure with very thin legs\nand a curious voot, a-standing on the ladder, and finishing their\nwork.  When it got daylight they could see that the work was really\nfinished, and couldn't at all mind finishing it themselves.  They\nwent home, and the next thing they heard was that a great scandal had\nbeen caused in the church that Sunday morning, for when the people\ncame and service began, all saw that the Ten Commandments wez painted\nwith the 'nots' left out.  Decent people wouldn't attend service\nthere for a long time, and the Bishop had to be sent for to\nreconsecrate the church.  That's the tradition as I used to hear it\nas a child.  You must take it for what it is wo'th, but this case\nto-day has reminded me o't, as I say.\"\n\nThe visitors gave one more glance, as if to see whether Jude and\nSue had left the \"nots\" out likewise, and then severally left the\nchurch, even the old woman at last.  Sue and Jude, who had not\nstopped working, sent back the child to school, and remained without\nspeaking; till, looking at her narrowly, he found she had been crying\nsilently.\n\n\"Never mind, comrade!\" he said.  \"I know what it is!\"\n\n\"I can't BEAR that they, and everybody, should think people wicked\nbecause they may have chosen to live their own way!  It is really\nthese opinions that make the best intentioned people reckless, and\nactually become immoral!\"\n\n\"Never be cast down!  It was only a funny story.\"\n\n\"Ah, but we suggested it!  I am afraid I have done you mischief,\nJude, instead of helping you by coming!\"\n\nTo have suggested such a story was certainly not very exhilarating,\nin a serious view of their position.  However, in a few minutes Sue\nseemed to see that their position this morning had a ludicrous side,\nand wiping her eyes she laughed.\n\n\"It is droll, after all,\" she said, \"that we two, of all people,\nwith our queer history, should happen to be here painting the\nTen Commandments!  You a reprobate, and I--in my condition...  O\ndear!\" ...  And with her hand over her eyes she laughed again\nsilently and intermittently, till she was quite weak.\n\n\"That's better,\" said Jude gaily.  \"Now we are right again, aren't\nwe, little girl!\"\n\n\"Oh but it is serious, all the same!\" she sighed as she took up the\nbrush and righted herself.  \"But do you see they don't think we are\nmarried?  They WON'T believe it!  It is extraordinary!\"\n\n\"I don't care whether they think so or not,\" said Jude.  \"I shan't\ntake any more trouble to make them.\"\n\nThey sat down to lunch--which they had brought with them not to\nhinder time--and having eaten it, were about to set to work anew when\na man entered the church, and Jude recognized in him the contractor\nWillis.  He beckoned to Jude, and spoke to him apart.\n\n\"Here--I've just had a complaint about this,\" he said, with rather\nbreathless awkwardness.  \"I don't wish to go into the matter--as of\ncourse I didn't know what was going on--but I am afraid I must ask\nyou and her to leave off, and let somebody else finish this!  It is\nbest, to avoid all unpleasantness.  I'll pay you for the week, all\nthe same.\"\n\nJude was too independent to make any fuss; and the contractor paid\nhim, and left.  Jude picked up his tools, and Sue cleansed her brush.\nThen their eyes met.\n\n\"How could we be so simple as to suppose we might do this!\" said\nshe, dropping to her tragic note.  \"Of course we ought not--I ought\nnot--to have come!\"\n\n\"I had no idea that anybody was going to intrude into such a lonely\nplace and see us!\"  Jude returned.  \"Well, it can't be helped, dear;\nand of course I wouldn't wish to injure Willis's trade-connection by\nstaying.\"  They sat down passively for a few minutes, proceeded out\nof the church, and overtaking the boy pursued their thoughtful way\nto Aldbrickham.\n\nFawley had still a pretty zeal in the cause of education, and, as was\nnatural with his experiences, he was active in furthering \"equality\nof opportunity\" by any humble means open to him.  He had joined an\nArtizans' Mutual Improvement Society established in the town about\nthe time of his arrival there; its members being young men of all\ncreeds and denominations, including Churchmen, Congregationalists,\nBaptists, Unitarians, Positivists, and others--Agnostics had scarcely\nbeen heard of at this time--their one common wish to enlarge their\nminds forming a sufficiently close bond of union.  The subscription\nwas small, and the room homely; and Jude's activity, uncustomary\nacquirements, and, above all, singular intuition on what to read\nand how to set about it--begotten of his years of struggle against\nmalignant stars--had led to his being placed on the committee.\n\nA few evenings after his dismissal from the church repairs, and\nbefore he had obtained any more work to do, he went to attend a\nmeeting of the aforesaid committee.  It was late when he arrived: all\nthe others had come, and as he entered they looked dubiously at him,\nand hardly uttered a word of greeting.  He guessed that something\nbearing on himself had been either discussed or mooted.  Some\nordinary business was transacted, and it was disclosed that the\nnumber of subscriptions had shown a sudden falling off for that\nquarter.  One member--a really well-meaning and upright man--began\nspeaking in enigmas about certain possible causes: that it behoved\nthem to look well into their constitution; for if the committee were\nnot respected, and had not at least, in their differences, a common\nstandard of CONDUCT, they would bring the institution to the ground.\nNothing further was said in Jude's presence, but he knew what this\nmeant; and turning to the table wrote a note resigning his office\nthere and then.\n\nThus the supersensitive couple were more and more impelled to go\naway.  And then bills were sent in, and the question arose, what\ncould Jude do with his great-aunt's heavy old furniture, if he left\nthe town to travel he knew not whither?  This, and the necessity of\nready money, compelled him to decide on an auction, much as he would\nhave preferred to keep the venerable goods.\n\nThe day of the sale came on; and Sue for the last time cooked her\nown, the child's, and Jude's breakfast in the little house he had\nfurnished.  It chanced to be a wet day; moreover Sue was unwell, and\nnot wishing to desert her poor Jude in such gloomy circumstances,\nfor he was compelled to stay awhile, she acted on the suggestion of\nthe auctioneer's man, and ensconced herself in an upper room, which\ncould be emptied of its effects, and so kept closed to the bidders.\nHere Jude discovered her; and with the child, and their few trunks,\nbaskets, and bundles, and two chairs and a table that were not in\nthe sale, the two sat in meditative talk.\n\nFootsteps began stamping up and down the bare stairs, the comers\ninspecting the goods, some of which were of so quaint and ancient a\nmake as to acquire an adventitious value as art.  Their door was\ntried once or twice, and to guard themselves against intrusion Jude\nwrote \"Private\" on a scrap of paper, and stuck it upon the panel.\n\nThey soon found that, instead of the furniture, their own personal\nhistories and past conduct began to be discussed to an unexpected\nand intolerable extent by the intending bidders.  It was not till\nnow that they really discovered what a fools' paradise of supposed\nunrecognition they had been living in of late.  Sue silently took\nher companion's hand, and with eyes on each other they heard these\npassing remarks--the quaint and mysterious personality of Father\nTime being a subject which formed a large ingredient in the hints and\ninnuendoes.  At length the auction began in the room below, whence\nthey could hear each familiar article knocked down, the highly prized\nones cheaply, the unconsidered at an unexpected price.\n\n\"People don't understand us,\" he sighed heavily.  \"I am glad we have\ndecided to go.\"\n\n\"The question is, where to?\"\n\n\"It ought to be to London.  There one can live as one chooses.\"\n\n\"No--not London, dear!  I know it well.  We should be unhappy there.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Can't you think?\"\n\n\"Because Arabella is there?\"\n\n\"That's the chief reason.\"\n\n\"But in the country I shall always be uneasy lest there should be\nsome more of our late experience.  And I don't care to lessen it by\nexplaining, for one thing, all about the boy's history.  To cut him\noff from his past I have determined to keep silence.  I am sickened\nof ecclesiastical work now; and I shouldn't like to accept it, if\noffered me!\"\n\n\"You ought to have learnt classic.  Gothic is barbaric art, after\nall.  Pugin was wrong, and Wren was right.  Remember the interior of\nChristminster Cathedral--almost the first place in which we looked\nin each other's faces.  Under the picturesqueness of those Norman\ndetails one can see the grotesque childishness of uncouth people\ntrying to imitate the vanished Roman forms, remembered by dim\ntradition only.\"\n\n\"Yes--you have half-converted me to that view by what you have said\nbefore.  But one can work, and despise what one does.  I must do\nsomething, if not church-gothic.\"\n\n\"I wish we could both follow an occupation in which personal\ncircumstances don't count,\" she said, smiling up wistfully.  \"I am\nas disqualified for teaching as you are for ecclesiastical art.  You\nmust fall back upon railway stations, bridges, theatres, music-halls,\nhotels--everything that has no connection with conduct.\"\n\n\"I am not skilled in those...  I ought to take to bread-baking.  I\ngrew up in the baking business with aunt, you know.  But even a baker\nmust be conventional, to get customers.\"\n\n\"Unless he keeps a cake and gingerbread stall at markets and fairs,\nwhere people are gloriously indifferent to everything except the\nquality of the goods.\"\n\nTheir thoughts were diverted by the voice of the auctioneer: \"Now\nthis antique oak settle--a unique example of old English furniture,\nworthy the attention of all collectors!\"\n\n\"That was my great-grandfather's,\" said Jude.  \"I wish we could have\nkept the poor old thing!\"\n\nOne by one the articles went, and the afternoon passed away.  Jude\nand the other two were getting tired and hungry, but after the\nconversation they had heard they were shy of going out while the\npurchasers were in their line of retreat.  However, the later lots\ndrew on, and it became necessary to emerge into the rain soon, to\ntake on Sue's things to their temporary lodging.\n\n\"Now the next lot: two pairs of pigeons, all alive and plump--a nice\npie for somebody for next Sunday's dinner!\"\n\nThe impending sale of these birds had been the most trying suspense\nof the whole afternoon.  They were Sue's pets, and when it was found\nthat they could not possibly be kept, more sadness was caused than by\nparting from all the furniture.  Sue tried to think away her tears\nas she heard the trifling sum that her dears were deemed to be worth\nadvanced by small stages to the price at which they were finally\nknocked down.  The purchaser was a neighbouring poulterer, and they\nwere unquestionably doomed to die before the next market day.\n\nNoting her dissembled distress Jude kissed her, and said it was time\nto go and see if the lodgings were ready.  He would go on with the\nboy, and fetch her soon.\n\nWhen she was left alone she waited patiently, but Jude did not come\nback.  At last she started, the coast being clear, and on passing the\npoulterer's shop, not far off, she saw her pigeons in a hamper by the\ndoor.  An emotion at sight of them, assisted by the growing dusk of\nevening, caused her to act on impulse, and first looking around her\nquickly, she pulled out the peg which fastened down the cover, and\nwent on.  The cover was lifted from within, and the pigeons flew\naway with a clatter that brought the chagrined poulterer cursing and\nswearing to the door.\n\nSue reached the lodging trembling, and found Jude and the boy making\nit comfortable for her.  \"Do the buyers pay before they bring away\nthe things?\" she asked breathlessly.\n\n\"Yes, I think.  Why?\"\n\n\"Because, then, I've done such a wicked thing!\"  And she explained,\nin bitter contrition.\n\n\"I shall have to pay the poulterer for them, if he doesn't catch\nthem,\" said Jude.  \"But never mind.  Don't fret about it, dear.\"\n\n\"It was so foolish of me!  Oh why should Nature's law be mutual\nbutchery!\"\n\n\"Is it so, Mother?\" asked the boy intently.\n\n\"Yes!\" said Sue vehemently.\n\n\"Well, they must take their chance, now, poor things,\" said Jude.\n\"As soon as the sale-account is wound up, and our bills paid, we go.\"\n\n\"Where do we go to?\" asked Time, in suspense.\n\n\"We must sail under sealed orders, that nobody may trace us...  We\nmustn't go to Alfredston, or to Melchester, or to Shaston, or to\nChristminster.  Apart from those we may go anywhere.\"\n\n\"Why mustn't we go there, Father?\"\n\n\"Because of a cloud that has gathered over us; though 'we have\nwronged no man, corrupted no man, defrauded no man!'  Though perhaps\nwe have 'done that which was right in our own eyes.'\"\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nFrom that week Jude Fawley and Sue walked no more in the town of\nAldbrickham.\n\nWhither they had gone nobody knew, chiefly because nobody cared\nto know.  Any one sufficiently curious to trace the steps of such\nan obscure pair might have discovered without great trouble that\nthey had taken advantage of his adaptive craftsmanship to enter\non a shifting, almost nomadic, life, which was not without its\npleasantness for a time.\n\nWherever Jude heard of free-stone work to be done, thither he went,\nchoosing by preference places remote from his old haunts and Sue's.\nHe laboured at a job, long or briefly, till it was finished; and\nthen moved on.\n\nTwo whole years and a half passed thus.  Sometimes he might have\nbeen found shaping the mullions of a country mansion, sometimes\nsetting the parapet of a town-hall, sometimes ashlaring an hotel at\nSandbourne, sometimes a museum at Casterbridge, sometimes as far down\nas Exonbury, sometimes at Stoke-Barehills.  Later still he was at\nKennetbridge, a thriving town not more than a dozen miles south of\nMarygreen, this being his nearest approach to the village where he\nwas known; for he had a sensitive dread of being questioned as to his\nlife and fortunes by those who had been acquainted with him during\nhis ardent young manhood of study and promise, and his brief and\nunhappy married life at that time.\n\nAt some of these places he would be detained for months, at others\nonly a few weeks.  His curious and sudden antipathy to ecclesiastical\nwork, both episcopal and noncomformist, which had risen in him when\nsuffering under a smarting sense of misconception, remained with him\nin cold blood, less from any fear of renewed censure than from an\nultra-conscientiousness which would not allow him to seek a living\nout of those who would disapprove of his ways; also, too, from a\nsense of inconsistency between his former dogmas and his present\npractice, hardly a shred of the beliefs with which he had first\ngone up to Christminster now remaining with him.  He was mentally\napproaching the position which Sue had occupied when he first met\nher.\n\nOn a Saturday evening in May, nearly three years after Arabella's\nrecognition of Sue and himself at the agricultural show, some of\nthose who there encountered each other met again.\n\nIt was the spring fair at Kennetbridge, and, though this ancient\ntrade-meeting had much dwindled from its dimensions of former times,\nthe long straight street of the borough presented a lively scene\nabout midday.  At this hour a light trap, among other vehicles,\nwas driven into the town by the north road, and up to the door of\na temperance inn.  There alighted two women, one the driver, an\nordinary country person, the other a finely built figure in the deep\nmourning of a widow.  Her sombre suit, of pronounced cut, caused\nher to appear a little out of place in the medley and bustle of a\nprovincial fair.\n\n\"I will just find out where it is, Anny,\" said the widow-lady to her\ncompanion, when the horse and cart had been taken by a man who came\nforward: \"and then I'll come back, and meet you here; and we'll go\nin and have something to eat and drink.  I begin to feel quite a\nsinking.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said the other.  \"Though I would sooner have\nput up at the Chequers or The Jack.  You can't get much at these\ntemperance houses.\"\n\n\"Now, don't you give way to gluttonous desires, my child,\" said the\nwoman in weeds reprovingly.  \"This is the proper place.  Very well:\nwe'll meet in half an hour, unless you come with me to find out where\nthe site of the new chapel is?\"\n\n\"I don't care to.  You can tell me.\"\n\nThe companions then went their several ways, the one in crape walking\nfirmly along with a mien of disconnection from her miscellaneous\nsurroundings.  Making inquiries she came to a hoarding, within which\nwere excavations denoting the foundations of a building; and on\nthe boards without one or two large posters announcing that the\nfoundation-stone of the chapel about to be erected would be laid that\nafternoon at three o'clock by a London preacher of great popularity\namong his body.\n\nHaving ascertained thus much the immensely weeded widow retraced her\nsteps, and gave herself leisure to observe the movements of the fair.\nBy and by her attention was arrested by a little stall of cakes and\nginger-breads, standing between the more pretentious erections of\ntrestles and canvas.  It was covered with an immaculate cloth, and\ntended by a young woman apparently unused to the business, she being\naccompanied by a boy with an octogenarian face, who assisted her.\n\n\"Upon my--senses!\" murmured the widow to herself.  \"His wife Sue--if\nshe is so!\"  She drew nearer to the stall.  \"How do you do, Mrs.\nFawley?\" she said blandly.\n\nSue changed colour and recognized Arabella through the crape veil.\n\n\"How are you, Mrs. Cartlett?\" she said stiffly.  And then perceiving\nArabella's garb her voice grew sympathetic in spite of herself.\n\"What?--you have lost--\"\n\n\"My poor husband.  Yes.  He died suddenly, six weeks ago, leaving me\nnone too well off, though he was a kind husband to me.  But whatever\nprofit there is in public-house keeping goes to them that brew the\nliquors, and not to them that retail 'em...  And you, my little old\nman!  You don't know me, I expect?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do.  You be the woman I thought wer my mother for a bit, till\nI found you wasn't,\" replied Father Time, who had learned to use the\nWessex tongue quite naturally by now.\n\n\"All right.  Never mind.  I am a friend.\"\n\n\"Juey,\" said Sue suddenly, \"go down to the station platform with this\ntray--there's another train coming in, I think.\"\n\nWhen he was gone Arabella continued: \"He'll never be a beauty, will\nhe, poor chap!  Does he know I am his mother really?\"\n\n\"No. He thinks there is some mystery about his parentage--that's all.\nJude is going to tell him when he is a little older.\"\n\n\"But how do you come to be doing this?  I am surprised.\"\n\n\"It is only a temporary occupation--a fancy of ours while we are in a\ndifficulty.\"\n\n\"Then you are living with him still?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Married?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Any children?\"\n\n\"Two.\"\n\n\"And another coming soon, I see.\"\n\nSue writhed under the hard and direct questioning, and her tender\nlittle mouth began to quiver.\n\n\"Lord--I mean goodness gracious--what is there to cry about?  Some\nfolks would be proud enough!\"\n\n\"It is not that I am ashamed--not as you think!  But it seems\nsuch a terribly tragic thing to bring beings into the world--so\npresumptuous--that I question my right to do it sometimes!\"\n\n\"Take it easy, my dear...  But you don't tell me why you do such a\nthing as this?  Jude used to be a proud sort of chap--above any\nbusiness almost, leave alone keeping a standing.\"\n\n\"Perhaps my husband has altered a little since then.  I am sure he\nis not proud now!\"  And Sue's lips quivered again.  \"I am doing this\nbecause he caught a chill early in the year while putting up some\nstonework of a music-hall, at Quartershot, which he had to do in the\nrain, the work having to be executed by a fixed day.  He is better\nthan he was; but it has been a long, weary time!  We have had an old\nwidow friend with us to help us through it; but she's leaving soon.\"\n\n\"Well, I am respectable too, thank God, and of a serious way of\nthinking since my loss.  Why did you choose to sell gingerbreads?\"\n\n\"That's a pure accident.  He was brought up to the baking business,\nand it occurred to him to try his hand at these, which he can make\nwithout coming out of doors.  We call them Christminster cakes.\nThey are a great success.\"\n\n\"I never saw any like 'em.  Why, they are windows and towers, and\npinnacles!  And upon my word they are very nice.\"  She had helped\nherself, and was unceremoniously munching one of the cakes.\n\n\"Yes.  They are reminiscences of the Christminster Colleges.\nTraceried windows, and cloisters, you see.  It was a whim of his\nto do them in pastry.\"\n\n\"Still harping on Christminster--even in his cakes!\" laughed\nArabella.  \"Just like Jude.  A ruling passion.  What a queer fellow\nhe is, and always will be!\"\n\nSue sighed, and she looked her distress at hearing him criticized.\n\n\"Don't you think he is?  Come now; you do, though you are so fond of\nhim!\"\n\n\"Of course Christminster is a sort of fixed vision with him, which\nI suppose he'll never be cured of believing in.  He still thinks it\na great centre of high and fearless thought, instead of what it is,\na nest of commonplace schoolmasters whose characteristic is timid\nobsequiousness to tradition.\"\n\nArabella was quizzing Sue with more regard of how she was speaking\nthan of what she was saying.  \"How odd to hear a woman selling\ncakes talk like that!\" she said.  \"Why don't you go back to\nschool-keeping?\"\n\nShe shook her head.  \"They won't have me.\"\n\n\"Because of the divorce, I suppose?\"\n\n\"That and other things.  And there is no reason to wish it.  We\ngave up all ambition, and were never so happy in our lives till his\nillness came.\"\n\n\"Where are you living?\"\n\n\"I don't care to say.\"\n\n\"Here in Kennetbridge?\"\n\nSue's manner showed Arabella that her random guess was right.\n\n\"Here comes the boy back again,\" continued Arabella.  \"My boy and\nJude's!\"\n\nSue's eyes darted a spark.  \"You needn't throw that in my face!\" she\ncried.\n\n\"Very well--though I half-feel as if I should like to have him with\nme! ...  But Lord, I don't want to take him from 'ee--ever I should\nsin to speak so profane--though I should think you must have enough\nof your own!  He's in very good hands, that I know; and I am not the\nwoman to find fault with what the Lord has ordained.  I've reached a\nmore resigned frame of mind.\"\n\n\"Indeed!  I wish I had been able to do so.\"\n\n\"You should try,\" replied the widow, from the serene heights of a\nsoul conscious not only of spiritual but of social superiority.\n\"I make no boast of my awakening, but I'm not what I was.  After\nCartlett's death I was passing the chapel in the street next ours,\nand went into it for shelter from a shower of rain.  I felt a need\nof some sort of support under my loss, and, as 'twas righter than\ngin, I took to going there regular, and found it a great comfort.\nBut I've left London now, you know, and at present I am living at\nAlfredston, with my friend Anny, to be near my own old country.  I'm\nnot come here to the fair to-day. There's to be the foundation-stone\nof a new chapel laid this afternoon by a popular London preacher, and\nI drove over with Anny.  Now I must go back to meet her.\"\n\nThen Arabella wished Sue good-bye, and went on.\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nIn the afternoon Sue and the other people bustling about Kennetbridge\nfair could hear singing inside the placarded hoarding farther down\nthe street.  Those who peeped through the opening saw a crowd of\npersons in broadcloth, with hymn-books in their hands, standing round\nthe excavations for the new chapel-walls. Arabella Cartlett and her\nweeds stood among them.  She had a clear, powerful voice, which could\nbe distinctly heard with the rest, rising and falling to the tune,\nher inflated bosom being also seen doing likewise.\n\nIt was two hours later on the same day that Anny and Mrs. Cartlett,\nhaving had tea at the Temperance Hotel, started on their return\njourney across the high and open country which stretches between\nKennetbridge and Alfredston.  Arabella was in a thoughtful mood; but\nher thoughts were not of the new chapel, as Anny at first surmised.\n\n\"No--it is something else,\" at last said Arabella sullenly.  \"I\ncame here to-day never thinking of anybody but poor Cartlett, or of\nanything but spreading the Gospel by means of this new tabernacle\nthey've begun this afternoon.  But something has happened to turn my\nmind another way quite.  Anny, I've heard of un again, and I've seen\nHER!\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"I've heard of Jude, and I've seen his wife.  And ever since, do what\nI will, and though I sung the hymns wi' all my strength, I have not\nbeen able to help thinking about 'n; which I've no right to do as a\nchapel member.\"\n\n\"Can't ye fix your mind upon what was said by the London preacher\nto-day, and try to get rid of your wandering fancies that way?\"\n\n\"I do.  But my wicked heart will ramble off in spite of myself!\"\n\n\"Well--I know what it is to have a wanton mind o' my own, too!  If\nyou on'y knew what I do dream sometimes o' nights quite against my\nwishes, you'd say I had my struggles!\"  (Anny, too, had grown rather\nserious of late, her lover having jilted her.)\n\n\"What shall I do about it?\" urged Arabella morbidly.\n\n\"You could take a lock of your late-lost husband's hair, and have it\nmade into a mourning brooch, and look at it every hour of the day.\"\n\n\"I haven't a morsel!--and if I had 'twould be no good...  After all\nthat's said about the comforts of this religion, I wish I had Jude\nback again!\"\n\n\"You must fight valiant against the feeling, since he's another's.\nAnd I've heard that another good thing for it, when it afflicts\nvolupshious widows, is to go to your husband's grave in the dusk of\nevening, and stand a long while a-bowed down.\"\n\n\"Pooh!  I know as well as you what I should do; only I don't do it!\"\n\nThey drove in silence along the straight road till they were within\nthe horizon of Marygreen, which lay not far to the left of their\nroute.  They came to the junction of the highway and the cross-lane\nleading to that village, whose church-tower could be seen athwart the\nhollow.  When they got yet farther on, and were passing the lonely\nhouse in which Arabella and Jude had lived during the first months of\ntheir marriage, and where the pig-killing had taken place, she could\ncontrol herself no longer.\n\n\"He's more mine than hers!\" she burst out.  \"What right has she to\nhim, I should like to know!  I'd take him from her if I could!\"\n\n\"Fie, Abby!  And your husband only six weeks gone!  Pray against it!\"\n\n\"Be damned if I do!  Feelings are feelings!  I won't be a creeping\nhypocrite any longer--so there!\"\n\nArabella had hastily drawn from her pocket a bundle of tracts which\nshe had brought with her to distribute at the fair, and of which she\nhad given away several.  As she spoke she flung the whole remainder\nof the packet into the hedge.  \"I've tried that sort o' physic and\nhave failed wi' it.  I must be as I was born!\"\n\n\"Hush!  You be excited, dear!  Now you come along home quiet, and\nhave a cup of tea, and don't let us talk about un no more.  We won't\ncome out this road again, as it leads to where he is, because it\ninflames 'ee so.  You'll be all right again soon.\"\n\nArabella did calm herself down by degrees; and they crossed the\nridge-way.  When they began to descend the long, straight hill, they\nsaw plodding along in front of them an elderly man of spare stature\nand thoughtful gait.  In his hand he carried a basket; and there was\na touch of slovenliness in his attire, together with that indefinable\nsomething in his whole appearance which suggested one who was his\nown housekeeper, purveyor, confidant, and friend, through possessing\nnobody else at all in the world to act in those capacities for him.\nThe remainder of the journey was down-hill, and guessing him to be\ngoing to Alfredston they offered him a lift, which he accepted.\n\nArabella looked at him, and looked again, till at length she spoke.\n\"If I don't mistake I am talking to Mr. Phillotson?\"\n\nThe wayfarer faced round and regarded her in turn.  \"Yes; my name is\nPhillotson,\" he said.  \"But I don't recognize you, ma'am.\"\n\n\"I remember you well enough when you used to be schoolmaster out at\nMarygreen, and I one of your scholars.  I used to walk up there from\nCresscombe every day, because we had only a mistress down at our\nplace, and you taught better.  But you wouldn't remember me as I\nshould you?--Arabella Donn.\"\n\nHe shook his head.  \"No,\" he said politely, \"I don't recall the name.\nAnd I should hardly recognize in your present portly self the slim\nschool child no doubt you were then.\"\n\n\"Well, I always had plenty of flesh on my bones.  However, I am\nstaying down here with some friends at present.  You know, I suppose,\nwho I married?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Jude Fawley--also a scholar of yours--at least a night scholar--for\nsome little time, I think?  And known to you afterwards, if I am not\nmistaken.\"\n\n\"Dear me, dear me,\" said Phillotson, starting out of his stiffness.\n\"YOU Fawley's wife?  To be sure--he had a wife!  And he--I\nunderstood--\"\n\n\"Divorced her--as you did yours--perhaps for better reasons.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"Well--he med have been right in doing it--right for both; for I soon\nmarried again, and all went pretty straight till my husband died\nlately.  But you--you were decidedly wrong!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Phillotson, with sudden testiness.  \"I would rather not\ntalk of this, but--I am convinced I did only what was right, and\njust, and moral.  I have suffered for my act and opinions, but I hold\nto them; though her loss was a loss to me in more ways than one!\"\n\n\"You lost your school and good income through her, did you not?\"\n\n\"I don't care to talk of it.  I have recently come back here--to\nMarygreen. I mean.\"\n\n\"You are keeping the school there again, just as formerly?\"\n\nThe pressure of a sadness that would out unsealed him.  \"I am there,\"\nhe replied.  \"Just as formerly, no.  Merely on sufferance.  It was\na last resource--a small thing to return to after my move upwards,\nand my long indulged hopes--a returning to zero, with all its\nhumiliations.  But it is a refuge.  I like the seclusion of the\nplace, and the vicar having known me before my so-called eccentric\nconduct towards my wife had ruined my reputation as a schoolmaster,\nhe accepted my services when all other schools were closed against\nme.  However, although I take fifty pounds a year here after taking\nabove two hundred elsewhere, I prefer it to running the risk of\nhaving my old domestic experiences raked up against me, as I should\ndo if I tried to make a move.\"\n\n\"Right you are.  A contented mind is a continual feast.  She has done\nno better.\"\n\n\"She is not doing well, you mean?\"\n\n\"I met her by accident at Kennetbridge this very day, and she is\nanything but thriving.  Her husband is ill, and she anxious.  You\nmade a fool of a mistake about her, I tell 'ee again, and the harm\nyou did yourself by dirting your own nest serves you right, excusing\nthe liberty.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"She was innocent.\"\n\n\"But nonsense!  They did not even defend the case!\"\n\n\"That was because they didn't care to.  She was quite innocent of\nwhat obtained you your freedom, at the time you obtained it.  I saw\nher just afterwards, and proved it to myself completely by talking to\nher.\"\n\nPhillotson grasped the edge of the spring-cart, and appeared to be\nmuch stressed and worried by the information.  \"Still--she wanted to\ngo,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes.  But you shouldn't have let her.  That's the only way with\nthese fanciful women that chaw high--innocent or guilty.  She'd have\ncome round in time.  We all do!  Custom does it!  It's all the same\nin the end!  However, I think she's fond of her man still--whatever\nhe med be of her.  You were too quick about her.  _I_ shouldn't\nhave let her go!  I should have kept her chained on--her spirit for\nkicking would have been broke soon enough!  There's nothing like\nbondage and a stone-deaf taskmaster for taming us women.  Besides,\nyou've got the laws on your side.  Moses knew.  Don't you call to\nmind what he says?\"\n\n\"Not for the moment, ma'am, I regret to say.\"\n\n\"Call yourself a schoolmaster!  I used to think o't when they read\nit in church, and I was carrying on a bit.  'Then shall the man be\nguiltless; but the woman shall bear her iniquity.'  Damn rough on us\nwomen; but we must grin and put up wi' it!  Haw haw!  Well; she's got\nher deserts now.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Phillotson, with biting sadness.  \"Cruelty is the law\npervading all nature and society; and we can't get out of it if we\nwould!\"\n\n\"Well--don't you forget to try it next time, old man.\"\n\n\"I cannot answer you, madam.  I have never known much of womankind.\"\n\nThey had now reached the low levels bordering Alfredston, and passing\nthrough the outskirts approached a mill, to which Phillotson said his\nerrand led him; whereupon they drew up, and he alighted, bidding them\ngood-night in a preoccupied mood.\n\nIn the meantime Sue, though remarkably successful in her cake-selling\nexperiment at Kennetbridge fair, had lost the temporary brightness\nwhich had begun to sit upon her sadness on account of that success.\nWhen all her \"Christminster\" cakes had been disposed of she took\nupon her arm the empty basket, and the cloth which had covered the\nstanding she had hired, and giving the other things to the boy left\nthe street with him.  They followed a lane to a distance of half a\nmile, till they met an old woman carrying a child in short clothes,\nand leading a toddler in the other hand.\n\nSue kissed the children, and said, \"How is he now?\"\n\n\"Still better!\" returned Mrs. Edlin cheerfully.  \"Before you are\nupstairs again your husband will be well enough--don't 'ee trouble.\"\n\nThey turned, and came to some old, dun-tiled cottages with gardens\nand fruit-trees.  Into one of these they entered by lifting the latch\nwithout knocking, and were at once in the general living-room.  Here\nthey greeted Jude, who was sitting in an arm-chair, the increased\ndelicacy of his normally delicate features, and the childishly\nexpectant look in his eyes, being alone sufficient to show that he\nhad been passing through a severe illness.\n\n\"What--you have sold them all?\" he said, a gleam of interest lighting\nup his face.\n\n\"Yes.  Arcades, gables, east windows and all.\"  She told him the\npecuniary results, and then hesitated.  At last, when they were left\nalone, she informed him of the unexpected meeting with Arabella, and\nthe latter's widowhood.\n\nJude was discomposed.  \"What--is she living here?\" he said.\n\n\"No; at Alfredston,\" said Sue.\n\nJude's countenance remained clouded.  \"I thought I had better tell\nyou?\" she continued, kissing him anxiously.\n\n\"Yes...  Dear me!  Arabella not in the depths of London, but down\nhere!  It is only a little over a dozen miles across the country to\nAlfredston.  What is she doing there?\"\n\nShe told him all she knew.  \"She has taken to chapel-going,\" Sue\nadded; \"and talks accordingly.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Jude, \"perhaps it is for the best that we have almost\ndecided to move on.  I feel much better to-day, and shall be well\nenough to leave in a week or two.  Then Mrs. Edlin can go home\nagain--dear faithful old soul--the only friend we have in the world!\"\n\n\"Where do you think to go to?\"  Sue asked, a troublousness in her\ntones.\n\nThen Jude confessed what was in his mind.  He said it would surprise\nher, perhaps, after his having resolutely avoided all the old places\nfor so long.  But one thing and another had made him think a great\ndeal of Christminster lately, and, if she didn't mind, he would like\nto go back there.  Why should they care if they were known?  It was\noversensitive of them to mind so much.  They could go on selling\ncakes there, for that matter, if he couldn't work.  He had no sense\nof shame at mere poverty; and perhaps he would be as strong as ever\nsoon, and able to set up stone-cutting for himself there.\n\n\"Why should you care so much for Christminster?\" she said pensively.\n\"Christminster cares nothing for you, poor dear!\"\n\n\"Well, I do, I can't help it.  I love the place--although I know\nhow it hates all men like me--the so-called self-taught--how it\nscorns our laboured acquisitions, when it should be the first\nto respect them; how it sneers at our false quantities and\nmispronunciations, when it should say, I see you want help, my poor\nfriend! ...  Nevertheless, it is the centre of the universe to me,\nbecause of my early dream: and nothing can alter it.  Perhaps it will\nsoon wake up, and be generous.  I pray so! ...  I should like to go\nback to live there--perhaps to die there!  In two or three weeks I\nmight, I think.  It will then be June, and I should like to be there\nby a particular day.\"\n\nHis hope that he was recovering proved so far well grounded that\nin three weeks they had arrived in the city of many memories; were\nactually treading its pavements, receiving the reflection of the\nsunshine from its wasting walls.\n\n\n\n\n\nPart Sixth\n\n\nAT CHRISTMINSTER AGAIN\n\n\n\n   \"...  And she humbled her body greatly, and all the places\n    of her joy she filled with her torn hair.\"--ESTHER (Apoc.).\n\n\n      \"There are two who decline, a woman and I,\n      And enjoy our death in the darkness here.\"\n                               --R. BROWNING.\n\n\nI\n\n\nOn their arrival the station was lively with straw-hatted young men,\nwelcoming young girls who bore a remarkable family likeness to their\nwelcomers, and who were dressed up in the brightest and lightest of\nraiment.\n\n\"The place seems gay,\" said Sue.  \"Why--it is Remembrance\nDay!--Jude--how sly of you--you came to-day on purpose!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Jude quietly, as he took charge of the small child, and\ntold Arabella's boy to keep close to them, Sue attending to their own\neldest.  \"I thought we might as well come to-day as on any other.\"\n\n\"But I am afraid it will depress you!\" she said, looking anxiously at\nhim up and down.\n\n\"Oh, I mustn't let it interfere with our business; and we have a good\ndeal to do before we shall be settled here.  The first thing is\nlodgings.\"\n\nHaving left their luggage and his tools at the station they proceeded\non foot up the familiar street, the holiday people all drifting in\nthe same direction.  Reaching the Fourways they were about to turn\noff to where accommodation was likely to be found when, looking at\nthe clock and the hurrying crowd, Jude said: \"Let us go and see the\nprocession, and never mind the lodgings just now.  We can get them\nafterwards.\"\n\n\"Oughtn't we to get a house over our heads first?\" she asked.\n\nBut his soul seemed full of the anniversary, and together they went\ndown Chief Street, their smallest child in Jude's arms, Sue leading\nher little girl, and Arabella's boy walking thoughtfully and silently\nbeside them.  Crowds of pretty sisters in airy costumes, and meekly\nignorant parents who had known no college in their youth, were under\nconvoy in the same direction by brothers and sons bearing the opinion\nwritten large on them that no properly qualified human beings had\nlived on earth till they came to grace it here and now.\n\n\"My failure is reflected on me by every one of those young\nfellows,\" said Jude.  \"A lesson on presumption is awaiting me\nto-day!--Humiliation Day for me! ...  If you, my dear darling, hadn't\ncome to my rescue, I should have gone to the dogs with despair!\"\n\nShe saw from his face that he was getting into one of his\ntempestuous, self-harrowing moods.  \"It would have been better if we\nhad gone at once about our own affairs, dear,\" she answered.  \"I am\nsure this sight will awaken old sorrows in you, and do no good!\"\n\n\"Well--we are near; we will see it now,\" said he.\n\nThey turned in on the left by the church with the Italian porch,\nwhose helical columns were heavily draped with creepers, and pursued\nthe lane till there arose on Jude's sight the circular theatre with\nthat well-known lantern above it, which stood in his mind as the sad\nsymbol of his abandoned hopes, for it was from that outlook that he\nhad finally surveyed the City of Colleges on the afternoon of his\ngreat meditation, which convinced him at last of the futility of his\nattempt to be a son of the university.\n\nTo-day, in the open space stretching between this building and the\nnearest college, stood a crowd of expectant people.  A passage was\nkept clear through their midst by two barriers of timber, extending\nfrom the door of the college to the door of the large building\nbetween it and the theatre.\n\n\"Here is the place--they are just going to pass!\" cried Jude in\nsudden excitement.  And pushing his way to the front he took up a\nposition close to the barrier, still hugging the youngest child in\nhis arms, while Sue and the others kept immediately behind him.\nThe crowd filled in at their back, and fell to talking, joking, and\nlaughing as carriage after carriage drew up at the lower door of\nthe college, and solemn stately figures in blood-red robes began to\nalight.  The sky had grown overcast and livid, and thunder rumbled\nnow and then.\n\nFather Time shuddered.  \"It do seem like the Judgment Day!\" he\nwhispered.\n\n\"They are only learned Doctors,\" said Sue.\n\nWhile they waited big drops of rain fell on their heads and\nshoulders, and the delay grew tedious.  Sue again wished not to stay.\n\n\"They won't be long now,\" said Jude, without turning his head.\n\nBut the procession did not come forth, and somebody in the crowd, to\npass the time, looked at the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of the nearest college, and said\nhe wondered what was meant by the Latin inscription in its midst.\nJude, who stood near the inquirer, explained it, and finding that\nthe people all round him were listening with interest, went on to\ndescribe the carving of the frieze (which he had studied years\nbefore), and to criticize some details of masonry in other college\nfronts about the city.\n\nThe idle crowd, including the two policemen at the doors, stared like\nthe Lycaonians at Paul, for Jude was apt to get too enthusiastic over\nany subject in hand, and they seemed to wonder how the stranger\nshould know more about the buildings of their town than they\nthemselves did; till one of them said: \"Why, I know that man; he used\nto work here years ago--Jude Fawley, that's his name!  Don't you mind\nhe used to be nicknamed Tutor of St. Slums, d'ye mind?--because he\naimed at that line o' business?  He's married, I suppose, then, and\nthat's his child he's carrying.  Taylor would know him, as he knows\neverybody.\"\n\nThe speaker was a man named Jack Stagg, with whom Jude had formerly\nworked in repairing the college masonries; Tinker Taylor was seen to\nbe standing near.  Having his attention called the latter cried\nacross the barriers to Jude: \"You've honoured us by coming back\nagain, my friend!\"\n\nJude nodded.\n\n\"An' you don't seem to have done any great things for yourself by\ngoing away?\"\n\nJude assented to this also.\n\n\"Except found more mouths to fill!\"  This came in a new voice, and\nJude recognized its owner to be Uncle Joe, another mason whom he had\nknown.\n\nJude replied good-humouredly that he could not dispute it; and from\nremark to remark something like a general conversation arose between\nhim and the crowd of idlers, during which Tinker Taylor asked Jude if\nhe remembered the Apostles' Creed in Latin still, and the night of\nthe challenge in the public house.\n\n\"But Fortune didn't lie that way?\" threw in Joe.  \"Yer powers wasn't\nenough to carry 'ee through?\"\n\n\"Don't answer them any more!\" entreated Sue.\n\n\"I don't think I like Christminster!\" murmured little Time\nmournfully, as he stood submerged and invisible in the crowd.\n\nBut finding himself the centre of curiosity, quizzing, and comment,\nJude was not inclined to shrink from open declarations of what he\nhad no great reason to be ashamed of; and in a little while was\nstimulated to say in a loud voice to the listening throng generally:\n\n\"It is a difficult question, my friends, for any young man--that\nquestion I had to grapple with, and which thousands are weighing\nat the present moment in these uprising times--whether to follow\nuncritically the track he finds himself in, without considering his\naptness for it, or to consider what his aptness or bent may be, and\nre-shape his course accordingly.  I tried to do the latter, and I\nfailed.  But I don't admit that my failure proved my view to be a\nwrong one, or that my success would have made it a right one; though\nthat's how we appraise such attempts nowadays--I mean, not by their\nessential soundness, but by their accidental outcomes.  If I had\nended by becoming like one of these gentlemen in red and black that\nwe saw dropping in here by now, everybody would have said: 'See how\nwise that young man was, to follow the bent of his nature!'  But\nhaving ended no better than I began they say: 'See what a fool that\nfellow was in following a freak of his fancy!'\n\n\"However it was my poverty and not my will that consented to be\nbeaten.  It takes two or three generations to do what I tried to do\nin one; and my impulses--affections--vices perhaps they should be\ncalled--were too strong not to hamper a man without advantages; who\nshould be as cold-blooded as a fish and as selfish as a pig to have a\nreally good chance of being one of his country's worthies.  You may\nridicule me--I am quite willing that you should--I am a fit subject,\nno doubt.  But I think if you knew what I have gone through these\nlast few years you would rather pity me.  And if they knew\"--he\nnodded towards the college at which the dons were severally\narriving--\"it is just possible they would do the same.\"\n\n\"He do look ill and worn-out, it is true!\" said a woman.\n\nSue's face grew more emotional; but though she stood close to Jude\nshe was screened.\n\n\"I may do some good before I am dead--be a sort of success as a\nfrightful example of what not to do; and so illustrate a moral\nstory,\" continued Jude, beginning to grow bitter, though he had\nopened serenely enough.  \"I was, perhaps, after all, a paltry victim\nto the spirit of mental and social restlessness that makes so many\nunhappy in these days!\"\n\n\"Don't tell them that!\" whispered Sue with tears, at perceiving\nJude's state of mind.  \"You weren't that.  You struggled nobly to\nacquire knowledge, and only the meanest souls in the world would\nblame you!\"\n\nJude shifted the child into a more easy position on his arm, and\nconcluded: \"And what I appear, a sick and poor man, is not the worst\nof me.  I am in a chaos of principles--groping in the dark--acting by\ninstinct and not after example.  Eight or nine years ago when I came\nhere first, I had a neat stock of fixed opinions, but they dropped\naway one by one; and the further I get the less sure I am.  I doubt\nif I have anything more for my present rule of life than following\ninclinations which do me and nobody else any harm, and actually give\npleasure to those I love best.  There, gentlemen, since you wanted to\nknow how I was getting on, I have told you.  Much good may it do you!\nI cannot explain further here.  I perceive there is something wrong\nsomewhere in our social formulas: what it is can only be discovered\nby men or women with greater insight than mine--if, indeed, they ever\ndiscover it--at least in our time.  'For who knoweth what is good for\nman in this life?--and who can tell a man what shall be after him\nunder the sun?'\"\n\n\"Hear, hear,\" said the populace.\n\n\"Well preached!\" said Tinker Taylor.  And privately to his\nneighbours: \"Why, one of them jobbing pa'sons swarming about here,\nthat takes the services when our head reverends want a holiday,\nwouldn't ha' discoursed such doctrine for less than a guinea down.\nHey?  I'll take my oath not one o' 'em would!  And then he must have\nhad it wrote down for 'n.  And this only a working-man!\"\n\nAs a sort of objective commentary on Jude's remarks there drove up\nat this moment with a belated Doctor, robed and panting, a cab whose\nhorse failed to stop at the exact point required for setting down the\nhirer, who jumped out and entered the door.  The driver, alighting,\nbegan to kick the animal in the belly.\n\n\"If that can be done,\" said Jude, \"at college gates in the most\nreligious and educational city in the world, what shall we say as to\nhow far we've got?\"\n\n\"Order!\" said one of the policemen, who had been engaged with a\ncomrade in opening the large doors opposite the college.  \"Keep yer\ntongue quiet, my man, while the procession passes.\"  The rain came on\nmore heavily, and all who had umbrellas opened them.  Jude was not\none of these, and Sue only possessed a small one, half sunshade.  She\nhad grown pale, though Jude did not notice it then.\n\n\"Let us go on, dear,\" she whispered, endeavouring to shelter him.\n\"We haven't any lodgings yet, remember, and all our things are at the\nstation; and you are by no means well yet.  I am afraid this wet will\nhurt you!\"\n\n\"They are coming now.  Just a moment, and I'll go!\" said he.\n\nA peal of six bells struck out, human faces began to crowd the\nwindows around, and the procession of heads of houses and new Doctors\nemerged, their red and black gowned forms passing across the field of\nJude's vision like inaccessible planets across an object-glass.\n\nAs they went their names were called by knowing informants, and when\nthey reached the old round theatre of Wren a cheer rose high.\n\n\"Let's go that way!\" cried Jude, and though it now rained steadily\nhe seemed not to know it, and took them round to the theatre.  Here\nthey stood upon the straw that was laid to drown the discordant noise\nof wheels, where the quaint and frost-eaten stone busts encircling\nthe building looked with pallid grimness on the proceedings, and in\nparticular at the bedraggled Jude, Sue, and their children, as at\nludicrous persons who had no business there.\n\n\"I wish I could get in!\" he said to her fervidly.  \"Listen--I may\ncatch a few words of the Latin speech by staying here; the windows\nare open.\"\n\nHowever, beyond the peals of the organ, and the shouts and hurrahs\nbetween each piece of oratory, Jude's standing in the wet did not\nbring much Latin to his intelligence more than, now and then, a\nsonorous word in _um_ or _ibus_.\n\n\"Well--I'm an outsider to the end of my days!\" he sighed after a\nwhile.  \"Now I'll go, my patient Sue.  How good of you to wait in the\nrain all this time--to gratify my infatuation!  I'll never care any\nmore about the infernal cursed place, upon my soul I won't!  But what\nmade you tremble so when we were at the barrier?  And how pale you\nare, Sue!\"\n\n\"I saw Richard amongst the people on the other side.\"\n\n\"Ah--did you!\"\n\n\"He is evidently come up to Jerusalem to see the festival like the\nrest of us: and on that account is probably living not so very far\naway.  He had the same hankering for the university that you had, in\na milder form.  I don't think he saw me, though he must have heard\nyou speaking to the crowd.  But he seemed not to notice.\"\n\n\"Well--suppose he did.  Your mind is free from worries about him now,\nmy Sue?\"\n\n\"Yes, I suppose so.  But I am weak.  Although I know it is all right\nwith our plans, I felt a curious dread of him; an awe, or terror, of\nconventions I don't believe in.  It comes over me at times like a\nsort of creeping paralysis, and makes me so sad!\"\n\n\"You are getting tired, Sue.  Oh--I forgot, darling!  Yes, we'll go\non at once.\"\n\nThey started in quest of the lodging, and at last found something\nthat seemed to promise well, in Mildew Lane--a spot which to Jude was\nirresistible--though to Sue it was not so fascinating--a narrow lane\nclose to the back of a college, but having no communication with\nit.  The little houses were darkened to gloom by the high collegiate\nbuildings, within which life was so far removed from that of the\npeople in the lane as if it had been on opposite sides of the globe;\nyet only a thickness of wall divided them.  Two or three of the\nhouses had notices of rooms to let, and the newcomers knocked at the\ndoor of one, which a woman opened.\n\n\"Ah--listen!\" said Jude suddenly, instead of addressing her.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Why the bells--what church can that be?  The tones are familiar.\"\n\nAnother peal of bells had begun to sound out at some distance off.\n\n\"I don't know!\" said the landlady tartly.  \"Did you knock to ask\nthat?\"\n\n\"No; for lodgings,\" said Jude, coming to himself.\n\nThe householder scrutinized Sue's figure a moment.  \"We haven't any\nto let,\" said she, shutting the door.\n\nJude looked discomfited, and the boy distressed.  \"Now, Jude,\" said\nSue, \"let me try.  You don't know the way.\"\n\nThey found a second place hard by; but here the occupier, observing\nnot only Sue, but the boy and the small children, said civilly, \"I am\nsorry to say we don't let where there are children\"; and also closed\nthe door.\n\nThe small child squared its mouth and cried silently, with an\ninstinct that trouble loomed.  The boy sighed.  \"I don't like\nChristminster!\" he said.  \"Are the great old houses gaols?\"\n\n\"No; colleges,\" said Jude; \"which perhaps you'll study in some day.\"\n\n\"I'd rather not!\" the boy rejoined.\n\n\"Now we'll try again,\" said Sue.  \"I'll pull my cloak more round\nme...  Leaving Kennetbridge for this place is like coming from\nCaiaphas to Pilate! ...  How do I look now, dear?\"\n\n\"Nobody would notice it now,\" said Jude.\n\nThere was one other house, and they tried a third time.  The woman\nhere was more amiable; but she had little room to spare, and could\nonly agree to take in Sue and the children if her husband could go\nelsewhere.  This arrangement they perforce adopted, in the stress\nfrom delaying their search till so late.  They came to terms with\nher, though her price was rather high for their pockets.  But they\ncould not afford to be critical till Jude had time to get a more\npermanent abode; and in this house Sue took possession of a back room\non the second floor with an inner closet-room for the children.  Jude\nstayed and had a cup of tea; and was pleased to find that the window\ncommanded the back of another of the colleges.  Kissing all four he\nwent to get a few necessaries and look for lodgings for himself.\n\nWhen he was gone the landlady came up to talk a little with Sue, and\ngather something of the circumstances of the family she had taken in.\nSue had not the art of prevarication, and, after admitting several\nfacts as to their late difficulties and wanderings, she was startled\nby the landlady saying suddenly:\n\n\"Are you really a married woman?\"\n\nSue hesitated; and then impulsively told the woman that her husband\nand herself had each been unhappy in their first marriages, after\nwhich, terrified at the thought of a second irrevocable union, and\nlest the conditions of the contract should kill their love, yet\nwishing to be together, they had literally not found the courage\nto repeat it, though they had attempted it two or three times.\nTherefore, though in her own sense of the words she was a married\nwoman, in the landlady's sense she was not.\n\nThe housewife looked embarrassed, and went downstairs.  Sue sat by\nthe window in a reverie, watching the rain.  Her quiet was broken by\nthe noise of someone entering the house, and then the voices of a\nman and woman in conversation in the passage below.  The landlady's\nhusband had arrived, and she was explaining to him the incoming of\nthe lodgers during his absence.\n\nHis voice rose in sudden anger.  \"Now who wants such a woman here?\nand perhaps a confinement! ...  Besides, didn't I say I wouldn't have\nchildren?  The hall and stairs fresh painted, to be kicked about by\nthem!  You must have known all was not straight with 'em--coming like\nthat.  Taking in a family when I said a single man.\"\n\nThe wife expostulated, but, as it seemed, the husband insisted on\nhis point; for presently a tap came to Sue's door, and the woman\nappeared.\n\n\"I am sorry to tell you, ma'am,\" she said, \"that I can't let you have\nthe room for the week after all.  My husband objects; and therefore\nI must ask you to go.  I don't mind your staying over to-night, as\nit is getting late in the afternoon; but I shall be glad if you can\nleave early in the morning.\"\n\nThough she knew that she was entitled to the lodging for a week, Sue\ndid not wish to create a disturbance between the wife and husband,\nand she said she would leave as requested.  When the landlady had\ngone Sue looked out of the window again.  Finding that the rain had\nceased she proposed to the boy that, after putting the little ones\nto bed, they should go out and search about for another place, and\nbespeak it for the morrow, so as not to be so hard-driven then as\nthey had been that day.\n\nTherefore, instead of unpacking her boxes, which had just been sent\non from the station by Jude, they sallied out into the damp though\nnot unpleasant streets, Sue resolving not to disturb her husband\nwith the news of her notice to quit while he was perhaps worried\nin obtaining a lodging for himself.  In the company of the boy she\nwandered into this street and into that; but though she tried a dozen\ndifferent houses she fared far worse alone than she had fared in\nJude's company, and could get nobody to promise her a room for the\nfollowing day.  Every householder looked askance at such a woman and\nchild inquiring for accommodation in the gloom.\n\n\"I ought not to be born, ought I?\" said the boy with misgiving.\n\nThoroughly tired at last Sue returned to the place where she was\nnot welcome, but where at least she had temporary shelter.  In her\nabsence Jude had left his address; but knowing how weak he still was\nshe adhered to her determination not to disturb him till the next\nday.\n\n\n\nII\n\n\nSue sat looking at the bare floor of the room, the house being little\nmore than an old intramural cottage, and then she regarded the scene\noutside the uncurtained window.  At some distance opposite, the outer\nwalls of Sarcophagus College--silent, black, and windowless--threw\ntheir four centuries of gloom, bigotry, and decay into the little\nroom she occupied, shutting out the moonlight by night and the sun by\nday.  The outlines of Rubric College also were discernible beyond the\nother, and the tower of a third farther off still.  She thought of\nthe strange operation of a simple-minded man's ruling passion, that\nit should have led Jude, who loved her and the children so tenderly,\nto place them here in this depressing purlieu, because he was still\nhaunted by his dream.  Even now he did not distinctly hear the\nfreezing negative that those scholared walls had echoed to his\ndesire.\n\nThe failure to find another lodging, and the lack of room in this\nhouse for his father, had made a deep impression on the boy--a\nbrooding undemonstrative horror seemed to have seized him.  The\nsilence was broken by his saying: \"Mother, WHAT shall we do\nto-morrow!\"\n\n\"I don't know!\" said Sue despondently.  \"I am afraid this will\ntrouble your father.\"\n\n\"I wish Father was quite well, and there had been room for him!\nThen it wouldn't matter so much!  Poor Father!\"\n\n\"It wouldn't!\"\n\n\"Can I do anything?\"\n\n\"No!  All is trouble, adversity, and suffering!\"\n\n\"Father went away to give us children room, didn't he?\"\n\n\"Partly.\"\n\n\"It would be better to be out o' the world than in it, wouldn't it?\"\n\n\"It would almost, dear.\"\n\n\"'Tis because of us children, too, isn't it, that you can't get a\ngood lodging?\"\n\n\"Well--people do object to children sometimes.\"\n\n\"Then if children make so much trouble, why do people have 'em?\"\n\n\"Oh--because it is a law of nature.\"\n\n\"But we don't ask to be born?\"\n\n\"No indeed.\"\n\n\"And what makes it worse with me is that you are not my real mother,\nand you needn't have had me unless you liked.  I oughtn't to have\ncome to 'ee--that's the real truth!  I troubled 'em in Australia,\nand I trouble folk here.  I wish I hadn't been born!\"\n\n\"You couldn't help it, my dear.\"\n\n\"I think that whenever children be born that are not wanted they\nshould be killed directly, before their souls come to 'em, and not\nallowed to grow big and walk about!\"\n\nSue did not reply.  She was doubtfully pondering how to treat this\ntoo reflective child.\n\nShe at last concluded that, so far as circumstances permitted, she\nwould be honest and candid with one who entered into her difficulties\nlike an aged friend.\n\n\"There is going to be another in our family soon,\" she hesitatingly\nremarked.\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"There is going to be another baby.\"\n\n\"What!\"  The boy jumped up wildly.  \"Oh God, Mother, you've never\na-sent for another; and such trouble with what you've got!\"\n\n\"Yes, I have, I am sorry to say!\" murmured Sue, her eyes glistening\nwith suspended tears.\n\nThe boy burst out weeping.  \"Oh you don't care, you don't care!\" he\ncried in bitter reproach.  \"How EVER could you, Mother, be so wicked\nand cruel as this, when you needn't have done it till we was better\noff, and Father well!  To bring us all into MORE trouble!  No room\nfor us, and Father a-forced to go away, and we turned out to-morrow;\nand yet you be going to have another of us soon! ...  'Tis done o'\npurpose!--'tis--'tis!\"  He walked up and down sobbing.\n\n\"Y-you must forgive me, little Jude!\" she pleaded, her bosom heaving\nnow as much as the boy's. \"I can't explain--I will when you are\nolder.  It does seem--as if I had done it on purpose, now we are in\nthese difficulties!  I can't explain, dear!  But it--is not quite on\npurpose--I can't help it!\"\n\n\"Yes it is--it must be!  For nobody would interfere with us, like\nthat, unless you agreed!  I won't forgive you, ever, ever!  I'll\nnever believe you care for me, or Father, or any of us any more!\"\n\nHe got up, and went away into the closet adjoining her room, in which\na bed had been spread on the floor.  There she heard him say: \"If we\nchildren was gone there'd be no trouble at all!\"\n\n\"Don't think that, dear,\" she cried, rather peremptorily.  \"But go to\nsleep!\"\n\nThe following morning she awoke at a little past six, and decided\nto get up and run across before breakfast to the inn which Jude had\ninformed her to be his quarters, to tell him what had happened before\nhe went out.  She arose softly, to avoid disturbing the children,\nwho, as she knew, must be fatigued by their exertions of yesterday.\n\nShe found Jude at breakfast in the obscure tavern he had chosen as a\ncounterpoise to the expense of her lodging: and she explained to him\nher homelessness.  He had been so anxious about her all night, he\nsaid.  Somehow, now it was morning, the request to leave the lodgings\ndid not seem such a depressing incident as it had seemed the night\nbefore, nor did even her failure to find another place affect her so\ndeeply as at first.  Jude agreed with her that it would not be worth\nwhile to insist upon her right to stay a week, but to take immediate\nsteps for removal.\n\n\"You must all come to this inn for a day or two,\" he said.  \"It is\na rough place, and it will not be so nice for the children, but we\nshall have more time to look round.  There are plenty of lodgings in\nthe suburbs--in my old quarter of Beersheba.  Have breakfast with me\nnow you are here, my bird.  You are sure you are well?  There will\nbe plenty of time to get back and prepare the children's meal before\nthey wake.  In fact, I'll go with you.\"\n\nShe joined Jude in a hasty meal, and in a quarter of an hour they\nstarted together, resolving to clear out from Sue's too respectable\nlodging immediately.  On reaching the place and going upstairs she\nfound that all was quiet in the children's room, and called to the\nlandlady in timorous tones to please bring up the tea-kettle and\nsomething for their breakfast.  This was perfunctorily done, and\nproducing a couple of eggs which she had brought with her she put\nthem into the boiling kettle, and summoned Jude to watch them for the\nyoungsters, while she went to call them, it being now about half-past\neight o'clock.\n\nJude stood bending over the kettle, with his watch in his hand,\ntiming the eggs, so that his back was turned to the little inner\nchamber where the children lay.  A shriek from Sue suddenly caused\nhim to start round.  He saw that the door of the room, or rather\ncloset--which had seemed to go heavily upon its hinges as she pushed\nit back--was open, and that Sue had sunk to the floor just within it.\nHastening forward to pick her up he turned his eyes to the little\nbed spread on the boards; no children were there.  He looked in\nbewilderment round the room.  At the back of the door were fixed\ntwo hooks for hanging garments, and from these the forms of the two\nyoungest children were suspended, by a piece of box-cord round each\nof their necks, while from a nail a few yards off the body of little\nJude was hanging in a similar manner.  An overturned chair was near\nthe elder boy, and his glazed eyes were slanted into the room; but\nthose of the girl and the baby boy were closed.\n\nHalf-paralyzed by the strange and consummate horror of the scene, he\nlet Sue lie, cut the cords with his pocket-knife and threw the three\nchildren on the bed; but the feel of their bodies in the momentary\nhandling seemed to say that they were dead.  He caught up Sue, who\nwas in fainting fits, and put her on the bed in the other room, after\nwhich he breathlessly summoned the landlady and ran out for a Doctor.\n\nWhen he got back Sue had come to herself, and the two helpless\nwomen, bending over the children in wild efforts to restore them,\nand the triplet of little corpses, formed a sight which overthrew\nhis self-command.  The nearest surgeon came in, but, as Jude had\ninferred, his presence was superfluous.  The children were past\nsaving, for though their bodies were still barely cold it was\nconjectured that they had been hanging more than an hour.  The\nprobability held by the parents later on, when they were able to\nreason on the case, was that the elder boy, on waking, looked into\nthe outer room for Sue, and, finding her absent, was thrown into a\nfit of aggravated despondency that the events and information of the\nevening before had induced in his morbid temperament.  Moreover a\npiece of paper was found upon the floor, on which was written, in\nthe boy's hand, with the bit of lead pencil that he carried:\n\n\n   _Done because we are too menny._\n\n\nAt sight of this Sue's nerves utterly gave way, an awful conviction\nthat her discourse with the boy had been the main cause of the\ntragedy, throwing her into a convulsive agony which knew no\nabatement.  They carried her away against her wish to a room on the\nlower floor; and there she lay, her slight figure shaken with her\ngasps, and her eyes staring at the ceiling, the woman of the house\nvainly trying to soothe her.\n\nThey could hear from this chamber the people moving about above, and\nshe implored to be allowed to go back, and was only kept from doing\nso by the assurance that, if there were any hope, her presence might\ndo harm, and the reminder that it was necessary to take care of\nherself lest she should endanger a coming life.  Her inquiries were\nincessant, and at last Jude came down and told her there was no hope.\nAs soon as she could speak she informed him what she had said to the\nboy, and how she thought herself the cause of this.\n\n\"No,\" said Jude.  \"It was in his nature to do it.  The Doctor says\nthere are such boys springing up amongst us--boys of a sort unknown\nin the last generation--the outcome of new views of life.  They seem\nto see all its terrors before they are old enough to have staying\npower to resist them.  He says it is the beginning of the coming\nuniversal wish not to live.  He's an advanced man, the Doctor: but\nhe can give no consolation to--\"\n\nJude had kept back his own grief on account of her; but he now\nbroke down; and this stimulated Sue to efforts of sympathy which in\nsome degree distracted her from her poignant self-reproach.  When\neverybody was gone, she was allowed to see the children.\n\nThe boy's face expressed the whole tale of their situation.  On\nthat little shape had converged all the inauspiciousness and shadow\nwhich had darkened the first union of Jude, and all the accidents,\nmistakes, fears, errors of the last.  He was their nodal point, their\nfocus, their expression in a single term.  For the rashness of those\nparents he had groaned, for their ill assortment he had quaked, and\nfor the misfortunes of these he had died.\n\nWhen the house was silent, and they could do nothing but await the\ncoroner's inquest, a subdued, large, low voice spread into the air of\nthe room from behind the heavy walls at the back.\n\n\"What is it?\" said Sue, her spasmodic breathing suspended.\n\n\"The organ of the college chapel.  The organist practising I suppose.\nIt's the anthem from the seventy-third Psalm; 'Truly God is loving\nunto Israel.'\"\n\nShe sobbed again.  \"Oh, oh my babies!  They had done no harm!  Why\nshould they have been taken away, and not I!\"\n\nThere was another stillness--broken at last by two persons in\nconversation somewhere without.\n\n\"They are talking about us, no doubt!\" moaned Sue.  \"'We are made a\nspectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men!'\"\n\nJude listened--\"No--they are not talking of us,\" he said.  \"They\nare two clergymen of different views, arguing about the eastward\nposition.  Good God--the eastward position, and all creation\ngroaning!\"\n\nThen another silence, till she was seized with another uncontrollable\nfit of grief.  \"There is something external to us which says, 'You\nshan't!'  First it said, 'You shan't learn!'  Then it said, 'You\nshan't labour!'  Now it says, 'You shan't love!'\"\n\nHe tried to soothe her by saying, \"That's bitter of you, darling.\"\n\n\"But it's true!\"\n\nThus they waited, and she went back again to her room.  The baby's\nfrock, shoes, and socks, which had been lying on a chair at the time\nof his death, she would not now have removed, though Jude would fain\nhave got them out of her sight.  But whenever he touched them she\nimplored him to let them lie, and burst out almost savagely at the\nwoman of the house when she also attempted to put them away.\n\nJude dreaded her dull apathetic silences almost more than her\nparoxysms.  \"Why don't you speak to me, Jude?\" she cried out, after\none of these.  \"Don't turn away from me!  I can't BEAR the loneliness\nof being out of your looks!\"\n\n\"There, dear; here I am,\" he said, putting his face close to hers.\n\n\"Yes...  Oh, my comrade, our perfect union--our two-in-oneness--is\nnow stained with blood!\"\n\n\"Shadowed by death--that's all.\"\n\n\"Ah; but it was I who incited him really, though I didn't know I was\ndoing it!  I talked to the child as one should only talk to people of\nmature age.  I said the world was against us, that it was better to\nbe out of life than in it at this price; and he took it literally.\nAnd I told him I was going to have another child.  It upset him.  Oh\nhow bitterly he upbraided me!\"\n\n\"Why did you do it, Sue?\"\n\n\"I can't tell.  It was that I wanted to be truthful.  I couldn't\nbear deceiving him as to the facts of life.  And yet I wasn't\ntruthful, for with a false delicacy I told him too obscurely.--Why\nwas I half-wiser than my fellow-women?  And not entirely wiser!  Why\ndidn't I tell him pleasant untruths, instead of half-realities?  It\nwas my want of self-control, so that I could neither conceal things\nnor reveal them!\"\n\n\"Your plan might have been a good one for the majority of cases; only\nin our peculiar case it chanced to work badly perhaps.  He must have\nknown sooner or later.\"\n\n\"And I was just making my baby darling a new frock; and now I shall\nnever see him in it, and never talk to him any more! ...  My eyes are\nso swollen that I can scarcely see; and yet little more than a year\nago I called myself happy!  We went about loving each other too\nmuch--indulging ourselves to utter selfishness with each other!  We\nsaid--do you remember?--that we would make a virtue of joy.  I said\nit was Nature's intention, Nature's law and _raison d'\u00c3\u00aatre_ that we\nshould be joyful in what instincts she afforded us--instincts which\ncivilization had taken upon itself to thwart. What dreadful things I\nsaid!  And now Fate has given us this stab in the back for being such\nfools as to take Nature at her word!\"\n\nShe sank into a quiet contemplation, till she said, \"It is best,\nperhaps, that they should be gone.--Yes--I see it is!  Better that\nthey should be plucked fresh than stay to wither away miserably!\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Jude.  \"Some say that the elders should rejoice when\ntheir children die in infancy.\"\n\n\"But they don't know! ...  Oh my babies, my babies, could you be\nalive now!  You may say the boy wished to be out of life, or he\nwouldn't have done it.  It was not unreasonable for him to die: it\nwas part of his incurably sad nature, poor little fellow!  But then\nthe others--my OWN children and yours!\"\n\nAgain Sue looked at the hanging little frock and at the socks and\nshoes; and her figure quivered like a string.  \"I am a pitiable\ncreature,\" she said, \"good neither for earth nor heaven any more!\nI am driven out of my mind by things!  What ought to be done?\"\nShe stared at Jude, and tightly held his hand.\n\n\"Nothing can be done,\" he replied.  \"Things are as they are, and will\nbe brought to their destined issue.\"\n\nShe paused.  \"Yes!  Who said that?\" she asked heavily.\n\n\"It comes in the chorus of the _Agamemnon_.  It has been in my mind\ncontinually since this happened.\"\n\n\"My poor Jude--how you've missed everything!--you more than I, for\nI did get you!  To think you should know that by your unassisted\nreading, and yet be in poverty and despair!\"\n\nAfter such momentary diversions her grief would return in a wave.\n\nThe jury duly came and viewed the bodies, the inquest was held; and\nnext arrived the melancholy morning of the funeral.  Accounts in\nthe newspapers had brought to the spot curious idlers, who stood\napparently counting the window-panes and the stones of the walls.\nDoubt of the real relations of the couple added zest to their\ncuriosity.  Sue had declared that she would follow the two little\nones to the grave, but at the last moment she gave way, and the\ncoffins were quietly carried out of the house while she was lying\ndown.  Jude got into the vehicle, and it drove away, much to the\nrelief of the landlord, who now had only Sue and her luggage\nremaining on his hands, which he hoped to be also clear of later on\nin the day, and so to have freed his house from the exasperating\nnotoriety it had acquired during the week through his wife's unlucky\nadmission of these strangers.  In the afternoon he privately\nconsulted with the owner of the house, and they agreed that if any\nobjection to it arose from the tragedy which had occurred there they\nwould try to get its number changed.\n\nWhen Jude had seen the two little boxes--one containing little Jude,\nand the other the two smallest--deposited in the earth he hastened\nback to Sue, who was still in her room, and he therefore did not\ndisturb her just then.  Feeling anxious, however, he went again\nabout four o'clock.  The woman thought she was still lying down, but\nreturned to him to say that she was not in her bedroom after all.\nHer hat and jacket, too, were missing: she had gone out.  Jude\nhurried off to the public house where he was sleeping.  She had not\nbeen there.  Then bethinking himself of possibilities he went along\nthe road to the cemetery, which he entered, and crossed to where the\ninterments had recently taken place.  The idlers who had followed to\nthe spot by reason of the tragedy were all gone now.  A man with a\nshovel in his hands was attempting to earth in the common grave of\nthe three children, but his arm was held back by an expostulating\nwoman who stood in the half-filled hole.  It was Sue, whose coloured\nclothing, which she had never thought of changing for the mourning he\nhad bought, suggested to the eye a deeper grief than the conventional\ngarb of bereavement could express.\n\n\"He's filling them in, and he shan't till I've seen my little ones\nagain!\" she cried wildly when she saw Jude.  \"I want to see them once\nmore.  Oh Jude--please Jude--I want to see them!  I didn't know you\nwould let them be taken away while I was asleep!  You said perhaps I\nshould see them once more before they were screwed down; and then you\ndidn't, but took them away!  Oh Jude, you are cruel to me too!\"\n\n\"She's been wanting me to dig out the grave again, and let her get\nto the coffins,\" said the man with the spade.  \"She ought to be took\nhome, by the look o' her.  She is hardly responsible, poor thing,\nseemingly.  Can't dig 'em up again now, ma'am.  Do ye go home with\nyour husband, and take it quiet, and thank God that there'll be\nanother soon to swage yer grief.\"\n\nBut Sue kept asking piteously: \"Can't I see them once more--just\nonce!  Can't I?  Only just one little minute, Jude?  It would not\ntake long!  And I should be so glad, Jude!  I will be so good, and\nnot disobey you ever any more, Jude, if you will let me?  I would go\nhome quietly afterwards, and not want to see them any more!  Can't I?\nWhy can't I?\"\n\nThus she went on.  Jude was thrown into such acute sorrow that he\nalmost felt he would try to get the man to accede.  But it could\ndo no good, and might make her still worse; and he saw that it\nwas imperative to get her home at once.  So he coaxed her, and\nwhispered tenderly, and put his arm round her to support her; till\nshe helplessly gave in, and was induced to leave the cemetery.\n\nHe wished to obtain a fly to take her back in, but economy being so\nimperative she deprecated his doing so, and they walked along slowly,\nJude in black crape, she in brown and red clothing.  They were to\nhave gone to a new lodging that afternoon, but Jude saw that it was\nnot practicable, and in course of time they entered the now hated\nhouse.  Sue was at once got to bed, and the Doctor sent for.\n\nJude waited all the evening downstairs.  At a very late hour the\nintelligence was brought to him that a child had been prematurely\nborn, and that it, like the others, was a corpse.\n\n\n\nIII\n\n\nSue was convalescent, though she had hoped for death, and Jude had\nagain obtained work at his old trade.  They were in other lodgings\nnow, in the direction of Beersheba, and not far from the Church of\nCeremonies--Saint Silas.\n\nThey would sit silent, more bodeful of the direct antagonism of\nthings than of their insensate and stolid obstructiveness.  Vague\nand quaint imaginings had haunted Sue in the days when her intellect\nscintillated like a star, that the world resembled a stanza or melody\ncomposed in a dream; it was wonderfully excellent to the half-aroused\nintelligence, but hopelessly absurd at the full waking; that the\nFirst Cause worked automatically like a somnambulist, and not\nreflectively like a sage; that at the framing of the terrestrial\nconditions there seemed never to have been contemplated such\na development of emotional perceptiveness among the creatures\nsubject to those conditions as that reached by thinking and\neducated humanity.  But affliction makes opposing forces loom\nanthropomorphous; and those ideas were now exchanged for a sense of\nJude and herself fleeing from a persecutor.\n\n\"We must conform!\" she said mournfully.  \"All the ancient wrath of\nthe Power above us has been vented upon us, His poor creatures, and\nwe must submit.  There is no choice.  We must.  It is no use fighting\nagainst God!\"\n\n\"It is only against man and senseless circumstance,\" said Jude.\n\n\"True!\" she murmured.  \"What have I been thinking of!  I am getting\nas superstitious as a savage! ...  But whoever or whatever our foe\nmay be, I am cowed into submission.  I have no more fighting strength\nleft; no more enterprise.  I am beaten, beaten! ...  'We are made a\nspectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men!'  I am always\nsaying that now.\"\n\n\"I feel the same!\"\n\n\"What shall we do?  You are in work now; but remember, it may\nonly be because our history and relations are not absolutely\nknown...  Possibly, if they knew our marriage had not been formalized they\nwould turn you out of your job as they did at Aldbrickham!\"\n\n\"I hardly know.  Perhaps they would hardly do that.  However, I think\nthat we ought to make it legal now--as soon as you are able to go\nout.\"\n\n\"You think we ought?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\nAnd Jude fell into thought.  \"I have seemed to myself lately,\"\nhe said, \"to belong to that vast band of men shunned by the\nvirtuous--the men called seducers.  It amazes me when I think of it!\nI have not been conscious of it, or of any wrongdoing towards you,\nwhom I love more than myself.  Yet I am one of those men!  I wonder\nif any other of them are the same purblind, simple creatures as\nI? ...  Yes, Sue--that's what I am.  I seduced you...  You were a\ndistinct type--a refined creature, intended by Nature to be left\nintact.  But I couldn't leave you alone!\"\n\n\"No, no, Jude!\" she said quickly.  \"Don't reproach yourself with\nbeing what you are not.  If anybody is to blame it is I.\"\n\n\"I supported you in your resolve to leave Phillotson; and without me\nperhaps you wouldn't have urged him to let you go.\"\n\n\"I should have, just the same.  As to ourselves, the fact of our not\nhaving entered into a legal contract is the saving feature in our\nunion.  We have thereby avoided insulting, as it were, the solemnity\nof our first marriages.\"\n\n\"Solemnity?\"  Jude looked at her with some surprise, and grew\nconscious that she was not the Sue of their earlier time.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, with a little quiver in her words, \"I have had\ndreadful fears, a dreadful sense of my own insolence of action.\nI have thought--that I am still his wife!\"\n\n\"Whose?\"\n\n\"Richard's.\"\n\n\"Good God, dearest!--why?\"\n\n\"Oh I can't explain!  Only the thought comes to me.\"\n\n\"It is your weakness--a sick fancy, without reason or meaning!\nDon't let it trouble you.\"\n\nSue sighed uneasily.\n\nAs a set-off against such discussions as these there had come\nan improvement in their pecuniary position, which earlier in\ntheir experience would have made them cheerful.  Jude had quite\nunexpectedly found good employment at his old trade almost directly\nhe arrived, the summer weather suiting his fragile constitution; and\noutwardly his days went on with that monotonous uniformity which\nis in itself so grateful after vicissitude.  People seemed to have\nforgotten that he had ever shown any awkward aberrancies, and he\ndaily mounted to the parapets and copings of colleges he could never\nenter, and renewed the crumbling freestones of mullioned windows he\nwould never look from, as if he had known no wish to do otherwise.\n\nThere was this change in him; that he did not often go to any service\nat the churches now.  One thing troubled him more than any other;\nthat Sue and himself had mentally travelled in opposite directions\nsince the tragedy: events which had enlarged his own views of life,\nlaws, customs, and dogmas, had not operated in the same manner on\nSue's.  She was no longer the same as in the independent days, when\nher intellect played like lambent lightning over conventions and\nformalities which he at that time respected, though he did not now.\n\nOn a particular Sunday evening he came in rather late.  She was\nnot at home, but she soon returned, when he found her silent and\nmeditative.\n\n\"What are you thinking of, little woman?\" he asked curiously.\n\n\"Oh I can't tell clearly!  I have thought that we have been selfish,\ncareless, even impious, in our courses, you and I.  Our life has been\na vain attempt at self-delight.  But self-abnegation is the higher\nroad.  We should mortify the flesh--the terrible flesh--the curse of\nAdam!\"\n\n\"Sue!\" he murmured.  \"What has come over you?\"\n\n\"We ought to be continually sacrificing ourselves on the altar of\nduty!  But I have always striven to do what has pleased me.  I well\ndeserved the scourging I have got!  I wish something would take the\nevil right out of me, and all my monstrous errors, and all my sinful\nways!\"\n\n\"Sue--my own too suffering dear!--there's no evil woman in you.  Your\nnatural instincts are perfectly healthy; not quite so impassioned,\nperhaps, as I could wish; but good, and dear, and pure.  And as I\nhave often said, you are absolutely the most ethereal, least sensual\nwoman I ever knew to exist without inhuman sexlessness.  Why do you\ntalk in such a changed way?  We have not been selfish, except when no\none could profit by our being otherwise.  You used to say that human\nnature was noble and long-suffering, not vile and corrupt, and at\nlast I thought you spoke truly.  And now you seem to take such a much\nlower view!\"\n\n\"I want a humble heart; and a chastened mind; and I have never had\nthem yet!\"\n\n\"You have been fearless, both as a thinker and as a feeler, and you\ndeserved more admiration than I gave.  I was too full of narrow\ndogmas at that time to see it.\"\n\n\"Don't say that, Jude!  I wish my every fearless word and thought\ncould be rooted out of my history.  Self-renunciation--that's\neverything!  I cannot humiliate myself too much.  I should like to\nprick myself all over with pins and bleed out the badness that's in\nme!\"\n\n\"Hush!\" he said, pressing her little face against his breast as if\nshe were an infant.  \"It is bereavement that has brought you to this!\nSuch remorse is not for you, my sensitive plant, but for the wicked\nones of the earth--who never feel it!\"\n\n\"I ought not to stay like this,\" she murmured, when she had remained\nin the position a long while.\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"It is indulgence.\"\n\n\"Still on the same tack!  But is there anything better on earth than\nthat we should love one another?\"\n\n\"Yes.  It depends on the sort of love; and yours--ours--is the\nwrong.\"\n\n\"I won't have it, Sue!  Come, when do you wish our marriage to be\nsigned in a vestry?\"\n\nShe paused, and looked up uneasily.  \"Never,\" she whispered.\n\nNot knowing the whole of her meaning he took the objection serenely,\nand said nothing.  Several minutes elapsed, and he thought she had\nfallen asleep; but he spoke softly, and found that she was wide awake\nall the time.  She sat upright and sighed.\n\n\"There is a strange, indescribable perfume or atmosphere about you\nto-night, Sue,\" he said.  \"I mean not only mentally, but about your\nclothes, also.  A sort of vegetable scent, which I seem to know, yet\ncannot remember.\"\n\n\"It is incense.\"\n\n\"Incense?\"\n\n\"I have been to the service at St. Silas', and I was in the fumes of\nit.\"\n\n\"Oh--St. Silas.\"\n\n\"Yes.  I go there sometimes.\"\n\n\"Indeed.  You go there!\"\n\n\"You see, Jude, it is lonely here in the weekday mornings, when you\nare at work, and I think and think of--of my--\"  She stopped till she\ncould control the lumpiness of her throat.  \"And I have taken to go\nin there, as it is so near.\"\n\n\"Oh well--of course, I say nothing against it.  Only it is odd, for\nyou.  They little think what sort of chiel is amang them!\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Jude?\"\n\n\"Well--a sceptic, to be plain.\"\n\n\"How can you pain me so, dear Jude, in my trouble!  Yet I know you\ndidn't mean it.  But you ought not to say that.\"\n\n\"I won't. But I am much surprised!\"\n\n\"Well--I want to tell you something else, Jude.  You won't be angry,\nwill you?  I have thought of it a good deal since my babies died.\nI don't think I ought to be your wife--or as your wife--any longer.\"\n\n\"What? ...  But you ARE!\"\n\n\"From your point of view; but--\"\n\n\"Of course we were afraid of the ceremony, and a good many others\nwould have been in our places, with such strong reasons for fears.\nBut experience has proved how we misjudged ourselves, and overrated\nour infirmities; and if you are beginning to respect rites and\nceremonies, as you seem to be, I wonder you don't say it shall be\ncarried out instantly?  You certainly ARE my wife, Sue, in all but\nlaw.  What do you mean by what you said?\"\n\n\"I don't think I am!\"\n\n\"Not?  But suppose we HAD gone through the ceremony?  Would you feel\nthat you were then?\"\n\n\"No. I should not feel even then that I was.  I should feel worse\nthan I do now.\"\n\n\"Why so--in the name of all that's perverse, my dear?\"\n\n\"Because I am Richard's.\"\n\n\"Ah--you hinted that absurd fancy to me before!\"\n\n\"It was only an impression with me then; I feel more and more\nconvinced as time goes on that--I belong to him, or to nobody.\"\n\n\"My good heavens--how we are changing places!\"\n\n\"Yes.  Perhaps so.\"\n\nSome few days later, in the dusk of the summer evening, they were\nsitting in the same small room downstairs, when a knock came to the\nfront door of the carpenter's house where they were lodging, and in a\nfew moments there was a tap at the door of their room.  Before they\ncould open it the comer did so, and a woman's form appeared.\n\n\"Is Mr. Fawley here?\"\n\nJude and Sue started as he mechanically replied in the affirmative,\nfor the voice was Arabella's.\n\nHe formally requested her to come in, and she sat down in the window\nbench, where they could distinctly see her outline against the light;\nbut no characteristic that enabled them to estimate her general\naspect and air.  Yet something seemed to denote that she was not\nquite so comfortably circumstanced, nor so bouncingly attired, as she\nhad been during Cartlett's lifetime.\n\nThe three attempted an awkward conversation about the tragedy, of\nwhich Jude had felt it to be his duty to inform her immediately,\nthough she had never replied to his letter.\n\n\"I have just come from the cemetery,\" she said.  \"I inquired and\nfound the child's grave.  I couldn't come to the funeral--thank you\nfor inviting me all the same.  I read all about it in the papers,\nand I felt I wasn't wanted...  No--I couldn't come to the funeral,\"\nrepeated Arabella, who, seeming utterly unable to reach the ideal of\na catastrophic manner, fumbled with iterations.  \"But I am glad I\nfound the grave.  As 'tis your trade, Jude, you'll be able to put up\na handsome stone to 'em.\"\n\n\"I shall put up a headstone,\" said Jude drearily.\n\n\"He was my child, and naturally I feel for him.\"\n\n\"I hope so.  We all did.\"\n\n\"The others that weren't mine I didn't feel so much for, as was\nnatural.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nA sigh came from the dark corner where Sue sat.\n\n\"I had often wished I had mine with me,\" continued Mrs. Cartlett.\n\"Perhaps 'twouldn't have happened then!  But of course I didn't wish\nto take him away from your wife.\"\n\n\"I am not his wife,\" came from Sue.\n\nThe unexpectedness of her words struck Jude silent.\n\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon, I'm sure,\" said Arabella.  \"I thought you\nwere!\"\n\nJude had known from the quality of Sue's tone that her new and\ntranscendental views lurked in her words; but all except their\nobvious meaning was, naturally, missed by Arabella.  The latter,\nafter evincing that she was struck by Sue's avowal, recovered\nherself, and went on to talk with placid bluntness about \"her\" boy,\nfor whom, though in his lifetime she had shown no care at all,\nshe now exhibited a ceremonial mournfulness that was apparently\nsustaining to the conscience.  She alluded to the past, and in making\nsome remark appealed again to Sue.  There was no answer: Sue had\ninvisibly left the room.\n\n\"She said she was not your wife?\" resumed Arabella in another voice.\n\"Why should she do that?\"\n\n\"I cannot inform you,\" said Jude shortly.\n\n\"She is, isn't she?  She once told me so.\"\n\n\"I don't criticize what she says.\"\n\n\"Ah--I see!  Well, my time is up.  I am staying here to-night, and\nthought I could do no less than call, after our mutual affliction.\nI am sleeping at the place where I used to be barmaid, and to-morrow\nI go back to Alfredston.  Father is come home again, and I am living\nwith him.\"\n\n\"He has returned from Australia?\" said Jude with languid curiosity.\n\n\"Yes.  Couldn't get on there.  Had a rough time of it.  Mother died\nof dys--what do you call it--in the hot weather, and Father and two\nof the young ones have just got back.  He has got a cottage near the\nold place, and for the present I am keeping house for him.\"\n\nJude's former wife had maintained a stereotyped manner of strict good\nbreeding even now that Sue was gone, and limited her stay to a number\nof minutes that should accord with the highest respectability.  When\nshe had departed Jude, much relieved, went to the stairs and called\nSue--feeling anxious as to what had become of her.\n\nThere was no answer, and the carpenter who kept the lodgings said she\nhad not come in.  Jude was puzzled, and became quite alarmed at her\nabsence, for the hour was growing late.  The carpenter called his\nwife, who conjectured that Sue might have gone to St. Silas' church,\nas she often went there.\n\n\"Surely not at this time o' night?\" said Jude.  \"It is shut.\"\n\n\"She knows somebody who keeps the key, and she has it whenever she\nwants it.\"\n\n\"How long has she been going on with this?\"\n\n\"Oh, some few weeks, I think.\"\n\nJude went vaguely in the direction of the church, which he had never\nonce approached since he lived out that way years before, when his\nyoung opinions were more mystical than they were now.  The spot was\ndeserted, but the door was certainly unfastened; he lifted the latch\nwithout noise, and pushing to the door behind him, stood absolutely\nstill inside.  The prevalent silence seemed to contain a faint sound,\nexplicable as a breathing, or a sobbing, which came from the other\nend of the building.  The floor-cloth deadened his footsteps as he\nmoved in that direction through the obscurity, which was broken only\nby the faintest reflected night-light from without.\n\nHigh overhead, above the chancel steps, Jude could discern a huge,\nsolidly constructed Latin cross--as large, probably, as the original\nit was designed to commemorate.  It seemed to be suspended in the\nair by invisible wires; it was set with large jewels, which faintly\nglimmered in some weak ray caught from outside, as the cross swayed\nto and fro in a silent and scarcely perceptible motion.  Underneath,\nupon the floor, lay what appeared to be a heap of black clothes, and\nfrom this was repeated the sobbing that he had heard before.  It was\nhis Sue's form, prostrate on the paving.\n\n\"Sue!\" he whispered.\n\nSomething white disclosed itself; she had turned up her face.\n\n\"What--do you want with me here, Jude?\" she said almost sharply.\n\"You shouldn't come!  I wanted to be alone!  Why did you intrude\nhere?\"\n\n\"How can you ask!\" he retorted in quick reproach, for his full heart\nwas wounded to its centre at this attitude of hers towards him.\n\"Why do I come?  Who has a right to come, I should like to know, if\nI have not!  I, who love you better than my own self--better--far\nbetter--than you have loved me!  What made you leave me to come here\nalone?\"\n\n\"Don't criticize me, Jude--I can't bear it!--I have often told\nyou so.  You must take me as I am.  I am a wretch--broken by my\ndistractions!  I couldn't BEAR it when Arabella came--I felt so\nutterly miserable I had to come away.  She seems to be your wife\nstill, and Richard to be my husband!\"\n\n\"But they are nothing to us!\"\n\n\"Yes, dear friend, they are.  I see marriage differently now.  My\nbabies have been taken from me to show me this!  Arabella's child\nkilling mine was a judgement--the right slaying the wrong.  What,\nWHAT shall I do!  I am such a vile creature--too worthless to mix\nwith ordinary human beings!\"\n\n\"This is terrible!\" said Jude, verging on tears.  \"It is monstrous\nand unnatural for you to be so remorseful when you have done no\nwrong!\"\n\n\"Ah--you don't know my badness!\"\n\nHe returned vehemently: \"I do!  Every atom and dreg of it!  You make\nme hate Christianity, or mysticism, or Sacerdotalism, or whatever it\nmay be called, if it's that which has caused this deterioration in\nyou.  That a woman-poet, a woman-seer, a woman whose soul shone like\na diamond--whom all the wise of the world would have been proud of,\nif they could have known you--should degrade herself like this!  I am\nglad I had nothing to do with Divinity--damn glad--if it's going to\nruin you in this way!\"\n\n\"You are angry, Jude, and unkind to me, and don't see how things\nare.\"\n\n\"Then come along home with me, dearest, and perhaps I shall.  I am\noverburdened--and you, too, are unhinged just now.\"  He put his arm\nround her and lifted her; but though she came, she preferred to walk\nwithout his support.\n\n\"I don't dislike you, Jude,\" she said in a sweet and imploring voice.\n\"I love you as much as ever!  Only--I ought not to love you--any\nmore.  Oh I must not any more!\"\n\n\"I can't own it.\"\n\n\"But I have made up my mind that I am not your wife!  I belong to\nhim--I sacramentally joined myself to him for life.  Nothing can\nalter it!\"\n\n\"But surely we are man and wife, if ever two people were in this\nworld?  Nature's own marriage it is, unquestionably!\"\n\n\"But not Heaven's.  Another was made for me there, and ratified\neternally in the church at Melchester.\"\n\n\"Sue, Sue--affliction has brought you to this unreasonable state!\nAfter converting me to your views on so many things, to find you\nsuddenly turn to the right-about like this--for no reason whatever,\nconfounding all you have formerly said through sentiment merely!\nYou root out of me what little affection and reverence I had left in\nme for the Church as an old acquaintance...  What I can't understand\nin you is your extraordinary blindness now to your old logic.  Is it\npeculiar to you, or is it common to woman?  Is a woman a thinking\nunit at all, or a fraction always wanting its integer?  How you\nargued that marriage was only a clumsy contract--which it is--how you\nshowed all the objections to it--all the absurdities!  If two and two\nmade four when we were happy together, surely they make four now?  I\ncan't understand it, I repeat!\"\n\n\"Ah, dear Jude; that's because you are like a totally deaf man\nobserving people listening to music.  You say 'What are they\nregarding?  Nothing is there.'  But something is.\"\n\n\"That is a hard saying from you; and not a true parallel!  You threw\noff old husks of prejudices, and taught me to do it; and now you go\nback upon yourself.  I confess I am utterly stultified in my estimate\nof you.\"\n\n\"Dear friend, my only friend, don't be hard with me!  I can't help\nbeing as I am, I am convinced I am right--that I see the light at\nlast.  But oh, how to profit by it!\"\n\nThey walked along a few more steps till they were outside the\nbuilding and she had returned the key.  \"Can this be the girl,\" said\nJude when she came back, feeling a slight renewal of elasticity now\nthat he was in the open street; \"can this be the girl who brought\nthe pagan deities into this most Christian city?--who mimicked Miss\nFontover when she crushed them with her heel?--quoted Gibbon, and\nShelley, and Mill?  Where are dear Apollo, and dear Venus now!\"\n\n\"Oh don't, don't be so cruel to me, Jude, and I so unhappy!\" she\nsobbed.  \"I can't bear it!  I was in error--I cannot reason with you.\nI was wrong--proud in my own conceit!  Arabella's coming was the\nfinish.  Don't satirize me: it cuts like a knife!\"\n\nHe flung his arms round her and kissed her passionately there in the\nsilent street, before she could hinder him.  They went on till they\ncame to a little coffee-house. \"Jude,\" she said with suppressed\ntears, \"would you mind getting a lodging here?\"\n\n\"I will--if, if you really wish?  But do you?  Let me go to our door\nand understand you.\"\n\nHe went and conducted her in.  She said she wanted no supper, and\nwent in the dark upstairs and struck a light.  Turning she found that\nJude had followed her, and was standing at the chamber door.  She\nwent to him, put her hand in his, and said \"Good-night.\"\n\n\"But Sue!  Don't we live here?\"\n\n\"You said you would do as I wished!\"\n\n\"Yes.  Very well! ...  Perhaps it was wrong of me to argue\ndistastefully as I have done!  Perhaps as we couldn't conscientiously\nmarry at first in the old-fashioned way, we ought to have parted.\nPerhaps the world is not illuminated enough for such experiments as\nours!  Who were we, to think we could act as pioneers!\"\n\n\"I am so glad you see that much, at any rate.  I never deliberately\nmeant to do as I did.  I slipped into my false position through\njealousy and agitation!\"\n\n\"But surely through love--you loved me?\"\n\n\"Yes.  But I wanted to let it stop there, and go on always as mere\nlovers; until--\"\n\n\"But people in love couldn't live for ever like that!\"\n\n\"Women could: men can't, because they--won't. An average woman is\nin this superior to an average man--that she never instigates, only\nresponds.  We ought to have lived in mental communion, and no more.\"\n\n\"I was the unhappy cause of the change, as I have said\nbefore! ...  Well, as you will! ...  But human nature can't help\nbeing itself.\"\n\n\"Oh yes--that's just what it has to learn--self-mastery.\"\n\n\"I repeat--if either were to blame it was not you but I.\"\n\n\"No--it was I.  Your wickedness was only the natural man's desire\nto possess the woman.  Mine was not the reciprocal wish till envy\nstimulated me to oust Arabella.  I had thought I ought in charity to\nlet you approach me--that it was damnably selfish to torture you as\nI did my other friend.  But I shouldn't have given way if you hadn't\nbroken me down by making me fear you would go back to her...  But\ndon't let us say any more about it!  Jude, will you leave me to\nmyself now?\"\n\n\"Yes...  But Sue--my wife, as you are!\" he burst out; \"my old\nreproach to you was, after all, a true one.  You have never loved me\nas I love you--never--never!  Yours is not a passionate heart--your\nheart does not burn in a flame!  You are, upon the whole, a sort of\nfay, or sprite--not a woman!\"\n\n\"At first I did not love you, Jude; that I own.  When I first knew\nyou I merely wanted you to love me.  I did not exactly flirt with\nyou; but that inborn craving which undermines some women's morals\nalmost more than unbridled passion--the craving to attract and\ncaptivate, regardless of the injury it may do the man--was in me; and\nwhen I found I had caught you, I was frightened.  And then--I don't\nknow how it was--I couldn't bear to let you go--possibly to Arabella\nagain--and so I got to love you, Jude.  But you see, however fondly\nit ended, it began in the selfish and cruel wish to make your heart\nache for me without letting mine ache for you.\"\n\n\"And now you add to your cruelty by leaving me!\"\n\n\"Ah--yes!  The further I flounder, the more harm I do!\"\n\n\"O Sue!\" said he with a sudden sense of his own danger.  \"Do not\ndo an immoral thing for moral reasons!  You have been my social\nsalvation.  Stay with me for humanity's sake!  You know what a weak\nfellow I am.  My two arch-enemies you know--my weakness for womankind\nand my impulse to strong liquor.  Don't abandon me to them, Sue, to\nsave your own soul only!  They have been kept entirely at a distance\nsince you became my guardian-angel!  Since I have had you I have been\nable to go into any temptations of the sort, without risk.  Isn't\nmy safety worth a little sacrifice of dogmatic principle?  I am in\nterror lest, if you leave me, it will be with me another case of the\npig that was washed turning back to his wallowing in the mire!\"\n\nSue burst out weeping.  \"Oh, but you must not, Jude!  You won't!\nI'll pray for you night and day!\"\n\n\"Well--never mind; don't grieve,\" said Jude generously.  \"I did\nsuffer, God knows, about you at that time; and now I suffer again.\nBut perhaps not so much as you.  The woman mostly gets the worst of\nit in the long run!\"\n\n\"She does.\"\n\n\"Unless she is absolutely worthless and contemptible.  And this one\nis not that, anyhow!\"\n\nSue drew a nervous breath or two.  \"She is--I fear! ...  Now\nJude--good-night,--please!\"\n\n\"I mustn't stay?--Not just once more?  As it has been so many\ntimes--O Sue, my wife, why not?\"\n\n\"No--no--not wife! ...  I am in your hands, Jude--don't tempt me back\nnow I have advanced so far!\"\n\n\"Very well.  I do your bidding.  I owe that to you, darling, in\npenance for how I overruled it at the first time.  My God, how\nselfish I was!  Perhaps--perhaps I spoilt one of the highest and\npurest loves that ever existed between man and woman! ...  Then let\nthe veil of our temple be rent in two from this hour!\"\n\nHe went to the bed, removed one of the pair of pillows thereon, and\nflung it to the floor.\n\nSue looked at him, and bending over the bed-rail wept silently.\n\"You don't see that it is a matter of conscience with me, and not\nof dislike to you!\" she brokenly murmured.  \"Dislike to you!  But I\ncan't say any more--it breaks my heart--it will be undoing all I\nhave begun!  Jude--good-night!\"\n\n\"Good-night,\" he said, and turned to go.\n\n\"Oh but you shall kiss me!\" said she, starting up.  \"I\ncan't--bear--!\"\n\nHe clasped her, and kissed her weeping face as he had scarcely ever\ndone before, and they remained in silence till she said, \"Good-bye,\ngood-bye!\" And then gently pressing him away she got free, trying to\nmitigate the sadness by saying: \"We'll be dear friends just the same,\nJude, won't we?  And we'll see each other sometimes--yes!--and forget\nall this, and try to be as we were long ago?\"\n\nJude did not permit himself to speak, but turned and descended the\nstairs.\n\n\n\nIV\n\n\nThe man whom Sue, in her mental _volte-face_, was now regarding as\nher inseparable husband, lived still at Marygreen.\n\nOn the day before the tragedy of the children, Phillotson had seen\nboth her and Jude as they stood in the rain at Christminster watching\nthe procession to the theatre.  But he had said nothing of it at the\nmoment to his companion Gillingham, who, being an old friend, was\nstaying with him at the village aforesaid, and had, indeed, suggested\nthe day's trip to Christminster.\n\n\"What are you thinking of?\" said Gillingham, as they went home.  \"The\nuniversity degree you never obtained?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Phillotson gruffly.  \"Of somebody I saw to-day.\"  In a\nmoment he added, \"Susanna.\"\n\n\"I saw her, too.\"\n\n\"You said nothing.\"\n\n\"I didn't wish to draw your attention to her.  But, as you did see\nher, you should have said: 'How d'ye do, my dear-that-was?'\"\n\n\"Ah, well.  I might have.  But what do you think of this: I have good\nreason for supposing that she was innocent when I divorced her--that\nI was all wrong.  Yes, indeed!  Awkward, isn't it?\"\n\n\"She has taken care to set you right since, anyhow, apparently.\"\n\n\"H'm. That's a cheap sneer.  I ought to have waited, unquestionably.\"\n\nAt the end of the week, when Gillingham had gone back to his school\nnear Shaston, Phillotson, as was his custom, went to Alfredston\nmarket; ruminating again on Arabella's intelligence as he walked down\nthe long hill which he had known before Jude knew it, though his\nhistory had not beaten so intensely upon its incline.  Arrived in\nthe town he bought his usual weekly local paper; and when he had sat\ndown in an inn to refresh himself for the five miles' walk back, he\npulled the paper from his pocket and read awhile.  The account of the\n\"strange suicide of a stone-mason's children\" met his eye.\n\nUnimpassioned as he was, it impressed him painfully, and puzzled him\nnot a little, for he could not understand the age of the elder child\nbeing what it was stated to be.  However, there was no doubt that the\nnewspaper report was in some way true.\n\n\"Their cup of sorrow is now full!\" he said: and thought and thought\nof Sue, and what she had gained by leaving him.\n\nArabella having made her home at Alfredston, and the schoolmaster\ncoming to market there every Saturday, it was not wonderful that in\na few weeks they met again--the precise time being just after her\nreturn from Christminster, where she had stayed much longer than she\nhad at first intended, keeping an interested eye on Jude, though Jude\nhad seen no more of her.  Phillotson was on his way homeward when he\nencountered Arabella, and she was approaching the town.\n\n\"You like walking out this way, Mrs. Cartlett?\" he said.\n\n\"I've just begun to again,\" she replied.  \"It is where I lived\nas maid and wife, and all the past things of my life that are\ninteresting to my feelings are mixed up with this road.  And they\nhave been stirred up in me too, lately; for I've been visiting at\nChristminster.  Yes; I've seen Jude.\"\n\n\"Ah!  How do they bear their terrible affliction?\"\n\n\"In a ve-ry strange way--ve-ry strange!  She don't live with him any\nlonger.  I only heard of it as a certainty just before I left; though\nI had thought things were drifting that way from their manner when I\ncalled on them.\"\n\n\"Not live with her husband?  Why, I should have thought 'twould have\nunited them more.\"\n\n\"He's not her husband, after all.  She has never really married him\nalthough they have passed as man and wife so long.  And now, instead\nof this sad event making 'em hurry up, and get the thing done\nlegally, she's took in a queer religious way, just as I was in my\naffliction at losing Cartlett, only hers is of a more 'sterical sort\nthan mine.  And she says, so I was told, that she's your wife in the\neye of Heaven and the Church--yours only; and can't be anybody else's\nby any act of man.\"\n\n\"Ah--indeed? ...  Separated, have they!\"\n\n\"You see, the eldest boy was mine--\"\n\n\"Oh--yours!\"\n\n\"Yes, poor little fellow--born in lawful wedlock, thank God.  And\nperhaps she feels, over and above other things, that I ought to have\nbeen in her place.  I can't say.  However, as for me, I am soon off\nfrom here.  I've got Father to look after now, and we can't live in\nsuch a hum-drum place as this.  I hope soon to be in a bar again at\nChristminster, or some other big town.\"\n\nThey parted.  When Phillotson had ascended the hill a few steps he\nstopped, hastened back, and called her.\n\n\"What is, or was, their address?\"\n\nArabella gave it.\n\n\"Thank you.  Good afternoon.\"\n\nArabella smiled grimly as she resumed her way, and practised\ndimple-making all along the road from where the pollard willows begin\nto the old almshouses in the first street of the town.\n\nMeanwhile Phillotson ascended to Marygreen, and for the first time\nduring a lengthened period he lived with a forward eye.  On crossing\nunder the large trees of the green to the humble schoolhouse to which\nhe had been reduced he stood a moment, and pictured Sue coming out of\nthe door to meet him.  No man had ever suffered more inconvenience\nfrom his own charity, Christian or heathen, than Phillotson had done\nin letting Sue go.  He had been knocked about from pillar to post at\nthe hands of the virtuous almost beyond endurance; he had been nearly\nstarved, and was now dependent entirely upon the very small stipend\nfrom the school of this village (where the parson had got ill-spoken\nof for befriending him). He had often thought of Arabella's remarks\nthat he should have been more severe with Sue, that her recalcitrant\nspirit would soon have been broken.  Yet such was his obstinate and\nillogical disregard of opinion, and of the principles in which he had\nbeen trained, that his convictions on the rightness of his course\nwith his wife had not been disturbed.\n\nPrinciples which could be subverted by feeling in one direction were\nliable to the same catastrophe in another.  The instincts which had\nallowed him to give Sue her liberty now enabled him to regard her\nas none the worse for her life with Jude.  He wished for her still,\nin his curious way, if he did not love her, and, apart from policy,\nsoon felt that he would be gratified to have her again as his, always\nprovided that she came willingly.\n\nBut artifice was necessary, he had found, for stemming the cold and\ninhumane blast of the world's contempt.  And here were the materials\nready made.  By getting Sue back and remarrying her on the\nrespectable plea of having entertained erroneous views of her, and\ngained his divorce wrongfully, he might acquire some comfort, resume\nhis old courses, perhaps return to the Shaston school, if not even to\nthe Church as a licentiate.\n\nHe thought he would write to Gillingham to inquire his views, and\nwhat he thought of his, Phillotson's, sending a letter to her.\nGillingham replied, naturally, that now she was gone it were best to\nlet her be, and considered that if she were anybody's wife she was\nthe wife of the man to whom she had borne three children and owed\nsuch tragical adventures.  Probably, as his attachment to her seemed\nunusually strong, the singular pair would make their union legal in\ncourse of time, and all would be well, and decent, and in order.\n\n\"But they won't--Sue won't!\" exclaimed Phillotson to himself.\n\"Gillingham is so matter of fact.  She's affected by Christminster\nsentiment and teaching.  I can see her views on the indissolubility\nof marriage well enough, and I know where she got them.  They are not\nmine; but I shall make use of them to further mine.\"\n\nHe wrote a brief reply to Gillingham.  \"I know I am entirely wrong,\nbut I don't agree with you.  As to her having lived with and had\nthree children by him, my feeling is (though I can advance no logical\nor moral defence of it, on the old lines) that it has done little\nmore than finish her education.  I shall write to her, and learn\nwhether what that woman said is true or no.\"\n\nAs he had made up his mind to do this before he had written to his\nfriend, there had not been much reason for writing to the latter at\nall.  However, it was Phillotson's way to act thus.\n\nHe accordingly addressed a carefully considered epistle to Sue, and,\nknowing her emotional temperament, threw a Rhadamanthine strictness\ninto the lines here and there, carefully hiding his heterodox\nfeelings, not to frighten her.  He stated that, it having come to his\nknowledge that her views had considerably changed, he felt compelled\nto say that his own, too, were largely modified by events subsequent\nto their parting.  He would not conceal from her that passionate\nlove had little to do with his communication.  It arose from a wish\nto make their lives, if not a success, at least no such disastrous\nfailure as they threatened to become, through his acting on what\nhe had considered at the time a principle of justice, charity, and\nreason.\n\nTo indulge one's instinctive and uncontrolled sense of justice and\nright, was not, he had found, permitted with impunity in an old\ncivilization like ours.  It was necessary to act under an acquired\nand cultivated sense of the same, if you wished to enjoy an average\nshare of comfort and honour; and to let crude loving kindness take\ncare of itself.\n\nHe suggested that she should come to him there at Marygreen.\n\nOn second thoughts he took out the last paragraph but one; and having\nrewritten the letter he dispatched it immediately, and in some\nexcitement awaited the issue.\n\n\n\nA few days after a figure moved through the white fog which enveloped\nthe Beersheba suburb of Christminster, towards the quarter in which\nJude Fawley had taken up his lodging since his division from Sue.  A\ntimid knock sounded upon the door of his abode.\n\nIt was evening--so he was at home; and by a species of divination he\njumped up and rushed to the door himself.\n\n\"Will you come out with me?  I would rather not come in.  I want\nto--to talk with you--and to go with you to the cemetery.\"\n\nIt had been in the trembling accents of Sue that these words came.\nJude put on his hat.  \"It is dreary for you to be out,\" he said.\n\"But if you prefer not to come in, I don't mind.\"\n\n\"Yes--I do.  I shall not keep you long.\"\n\nJude was too much affected to go on talking at first; she, too, was\nnow such a mere cluster of nerves that all initiatory power seemed\nto have left her, and they proceeded through the fog like Acherontic\nshades for a long while, without sound or gesture.\n\n\"I want to tell you,\" she presently said, her voice now quick, now\nslow, \"so that you may not hear of it by chance.  I am going back to\nRichard.  He has--so magnanimously--agreed to forgive all.\"\n\n\"Going back?  How can you go--\"\n\n\"He is going to marry me again.  That is for form's sake, and to\nsatisfy the world, which does not see things as they are.  But of\ncourse I AM his wife already.  Nothing has changed that.\"\n\nHe turned upon her with an anguish that was well-nigh fierce.\n\n\"But you are MY wife!  Yes, you are.  You know it.  I have always\nregretted that feint of ours in going away and pretending to come\nback legally married, to save appearances.  I loved you, and you\nloved me; and we closed with each other; and that made the marriage.\nWe still love--you as well as I--KNOW it, Sue!  Therefore our\nmarriage is not cancelled.\"\n\n\"Yes; I know how you see it,\" she answered with despairing\nself-suppression.  \"But I am going to marry him again, as it would\nbe called by you.  Strictly speaking you, too--don't mind my saying\nit, Jude!--you should take back--Arabella.\"\n\n\"I should?  Good God--what next!  But how if you and I had married\nlegally, as we were on the point of doing?\"\n\n\"I should have felt just the same--that ours was not a marriage.\nAnd I would go back to Richard without repeating the sacrament, if\nhe asked me.  But 'the world and its ways have a certain worth' (I\nsuppose), therefore I concede a repetition of the ceremony...  Don't\ncrush all the life out of me by satire and argument, I implore you!\nI was strongest once, I know, and perhaps I treated you cruelly.\nBut Jude, return good for evil!  I am the weaker now.  Don't\nretaliate upon me, but be kind.  Oh be kind to me--a poor wicked\nwoman who is trying to mend!\"\n\nHe shook his head hopelessly, his eyes wet.  The blow of her\nbereavement seemed to have destroyed her reasoning faculty.  The once\nkeen vision was dimmed.  \"All wrong, all wrong!\" he said huskily.\n\"Error--perversity!  It drives me out of my senses.  Do you care for\nhim?  Do you love him?  You know you don't!  It will be a fanatic\nprostitution--God forgive me, yes--that's what it will be!\"\n\n\"I don't love him--I must, must, own it, in deepest remorse!  But I\nshall try to learn to love him by obeying him.\"\n\nJude argued, urged, implored; but her conviction was proof against\nall.  It seemed to be the one thing on earth on which she was firm,\nand that her firmness in this had left her tottering in every other\nimpulse and wish she possessed.\n\n\"I have been considerate enough to let you know the whole truth,\nand to tell it you myself,\" she said in cut tones; \"that you might\nnot consider yourself slighted by hearing of it at second hand.  I\nhave even owned the extreme fact that I do not love him.  I did not\nthink you would be so rough with me for doing so!  I was going to\nask you...\"\n\n\"To give you away?\"\n\n\"No.  To send--my boxes to me--if you would.  But I suppose you\nwon't.\"\n\n\"Why, of course I will.  What--isn't he coming to fetch you--to marry\nyou from here?  He won't condescend to do that?\"\n\n\"No--I won't let him.  I go to him voluntarily, just as I went away\nfrom him.  We are to be married at his little church at Marygreen.\"\n\nShe was so sadly sweet in what he called her wrong-headedness that\nJude could not help being moved to tears more than once for pity of\nher.  \"I never knew such a woman for doing impulsive penances, as\nyou, Sue!  No sooner does one expect you to go straight on, as the\none rational proceeding, than you double round the corner!\"\n\n\"Ah, well; let that go! ...  Jude, I must say good-bye!  But I wanted\nyou to go to the cemetery with me.  Let our farewell be there--beside\nthe graves of those who died to bring home to me the error of my\nviews.\"\n\nThey turned in the direction of the place, and the gate was opened to\nthem on application.  Sue had been there often, and she knew the way\nto the spot in the dark.  They reached it, and stood still.\n\n\"It is here--I should like to part,\" said she.\n\n\"So be it!\"\n\n\"Don't think me hard because I have acted on conviction.  Your\ngenerous devotion to me is unparalleled, Jude!  Your worldly failure,\nif you have failed, is to your credit rather than to your blame.\nRemember that the best and greatest among mankind are those who do\nthemselves no worldly good.  Every successful man is more or less a\nselfish man.  The devoted fail...  'Charity seeketh not her own.'\"\n\n\"In that chapter we are at one, ever beloved darling, and on it we'll\npart friends.  Its verses will stand fast when all the rest that you\ncall religion has passed away!\"\n\n\"Well--don't discuss it.  Good-bye, Jude; my fellow-sinner, and\nkindest friend!\"\n\n\"Good-bye, my mistaken wife.  Good-bye!\"\n\n\n\nV\n\n\nThe next afternoon the familiar Christminster fog still hung over all\nthings.  Sue's slim shape was only just discernible going towards the\nstation.\n\nJude had no heart to go to his work that day.  Neither could he go\nanywhere in the direction by which she would be likely to pass.\nHe went in an opposite one, to a dreary, strange, flat scene, where\nboughs dripped, and coughs and consumption lurked, and where he had\nnever been before.\n\n\"Sue's gone from me--gone!\" he murmured miserably.\n\nShe in the meantime had left by the train, and reached Alfredston\nRoad, where she entered the steam-tram and was conveyed into the\ntown.  It had been her request to Phillotson that he should not meet\nher.  She wished, she said, to come to him voluntarily, to his very\nhouse and hearthstone.\n\nIt was Friday evening, which had been chosen because the schoolmaster\nwas disengaged at four o'clock that day till the Monday morning\nfollowing.  The little car she hired at the Bear to drive her to\nMarygreen set her down at the end of the lane, half a mile from the\nvillage, by her desire, and preceded her to the schoolhouse with\nsuch portion of her luggage as she had brought.  On its return she\nencountered it, and asked the driver if he had found the master's\nhouse open.  The man informed her that he had, and that her things\nhad been taken in by the schoolmaster himself.\n\nShe could now enter Marygreen without exciting much observation.\nShe crossed by the well and under the trees to the pretty new school\non the other side, and lifted the latch of the dwelling without\nknocking.  Phillotson stood in the middle of the room, awaiting her,\nas requested.\n\n\"I've come, Richard,\" said she, looking pale and shaken, and sinking\ninto a chair.  \"I cannot believe--you forgive your--wife!\"\n\n\"Everything, darling Susanna,\" said Phillotson.\n\nShe started at the endearment, though it had been spoken advisedly\nwithout fervour.  Then she nerved herself again.\n\n\"My children--are dead--and it is right that they should be!  I am\nglad--almost.  They were sin-begotten.  They were sacrificed to teach\nme how to live!  Their death was the first stage of my purification.\nThat's why they have not died in vain! ...  You will take me back?\"\n\nHe was so stirred by her pitiful words and tone that he did more than\nhe had meant to do.  He bent and kissed her cheek.\n\nSue imperceptibly shrank away, her flesh quivering under the touch of\nhis lips.\n\nPhillotson's heart sank, for desire was renascent in him.  \"You still\nhave an aversion to me!\"\n\n\"Oh no, dear--I have been driving through the damp, and I was\nchilly!\" she said, with a hurried smile of apprehension.  \"When are\nwe going to have the marriage?  Soon?\"\n\n\"To-morrow morning, early, I thought--if you really wish.  I am\nsending round to the vicar to let him know you are come.  I have told\nhim all, and he highly approves--he says it will bring our lives to\na triumphant and satisfactory issue.  But--are you sure of yourself?\nIt is not too late to refuse now if--you think you can't bring\nyourself to it, you know?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I can!  I want it done quick.  Tell him, tell him at once!\nMy strength is tried by the undertaking--I can't wait long!\"\n\n\"Have something to eat and drink then, and go over to your room\nat Mrs. Edlin's.  I'll tell the vicar half-past eight to-morrow,\nbefore anybody is about--if that's not too soon for you?  My friend\nGillingham is here to help us in the ceremony.  He's been good enough\nto come all the way from Shaston at great inconvenience to himself.\"\n\nUnlike a woman in ordinary, whose eye is so keen for material things,\nSue seemed to see nothing of the room they were in, or any detail of\nher environment.  But on moving across the parlour to put down her\nmuff she uttered a little \"Oh!\" and grew paler than before.  Her look\nwas that of the condemned criminal who catches sight of his coffin.\n\n\"What?\" said Phillotson.\n\nThe flap of the bureau chanced to be open, and in placing her muff\nupon it her eye had caught a document which lay there.  \"Oh--only\na--funny surprise!\" she said, trying to laugh away her cry as she\ncame back to the table.\n\n\"Ah!  Yes,\" said Phillotson.  \"The licence.... It has just come.\"\n\nGillingham now joined them from his room above, and Sue nervously\nmade herself agreeable to him by talking on whatever she thought\nlikely to interest him, except herself, though that interested him\nmost of all.  She obediently ate some supper, and prepared to leave\nfor her lodging hard by.  Phillotson crossed the green with her,\nbidding her good-night at Mrs. Edlin's door.\n\nThe old woman accompanied Sue to her temporary quarters, and helped\nher to unpack.  Among other things she laid out a night-gown\ntastefully embroidered.\n\n\"Oh--I didn't know THAT was put in!\" said Sue quickly.  \"I didn't\nmean it to be.  Here is a different one.\"  She handed a new and\nabsolutely plain garment, of coarse and unbleached calico.\n\n\"But this is the prettiest,\" said Mrs. Edlin.  \"That one is no better\nthan very sackcloth o' Scripture!\"\n\n\"Yes--I meant it to be.  Give me the other.\"\n\nShe took it, and began rending it with all her might, the tears\nresounding through the house like a screech-owl.\n\n\"But my dear, dear!--whatever....\"\n\n\"It is adulterous!  It signifies what I don't feel--I bought it long\nago--to please Jude.  It must be destroyed!\"\n\nMrs. Edlin lifted her hands, and Sue excitedly continued to tear the\nlinen into strips, laying the pieces in the fire.\n\n\"You med ha' give it to me!\" said the widow.  \"It do make my heart\nache to see such pretty open-work as that a-burned by the flames--not\nthat ornamental night-rails can be much use to a' ould 'ooman like I.\nMy days for such be all past and gone!\"\n\n\"It is an accursed thing--it reminds me of what I want to forget!\"\nSue repeated.  \"It is only fit for the fire.\"\n\n\"Lord, you be too strict!  What do ye use such words for, and condemn\nto hell your dear little innocent children that's lost to 'ee!  Upon\nmy life I don't call that religion!\"\n\nSue flung her face upon the bed, sobbing.  \"Oh, don't, don't!  That\nkills me!\"  She remained shaken with her grief, and slipped down upon\nher knees.\n\n\"I'll tell 'ee what--you ought not to marry this man again!\" said\nMrs. Edlin indignantly.  \"You are in love wi' t' other still!\"\n\n\"Yes I must--I am his already!\"\n\n\"Pshoo!  You be t' other man's.  If you didn't like to commit\nyourselves to the binding vow again, just at first, 'twas all the\nmore credit to your consciences, considering your reasons, and you\nmed ha' lived on, and made it all right at last.  After all, it\nconcerned nobody but your own two selves.\"\n\n\"Richard says he'll have me back, and I'm bound to go!  If he had\nrefused, it might not have been so much my duty to--give up Jude.\nBut--\"  She remained with her face in the bed-clothes, and Mrs. Edlin\nleft the room.\n\nPhillotson in the interval had gone back to his friend Gillingham,\nwho still sat over the supper-table.  They soon rose, and walked out\non the green to smoke awhile.  A light was burning in Sue's room, a\nshadow moving now and then across the blind.\n\nGillingham had evidently been impressed with the indefinable charm of\nSue, and after a silence he said, \"Well: you've all but got her again\nat last.  She can't very well go a second time.  The pear has dropped\ninto your hand.\"\n\n\"Yes! ...  I suppose I am right in taking her at her word.  I confess\nthere seems a touch of selfishness in it.  Apart from her being what\nshe is, of course, a luxury for a fogey like me, it will set me right\nin the eyes of the clergy and orthodox laity, who have never forgiven\nme for letting her go.  So I may get back in some degree into my old\ntrack.\"\n\n\"Well--if you've got any sound reason for marrying her again, do it\nnow in God's name!  I was always against your opening the cage-door\nand letting the bird go in such an obviously suicidal way.  You might\nhave been a school inspector by this time, or a reverend, if you\nhadn't been so weak about her.\"\n\n\"I did myself irreparable damage--I know it.\"\n\n\"Once you've got her housed again, stick to her.\"\n\nPhillotson was more evasive to-night.  He did not care to admit\nclearly that his taking Sue to him again had at bottom nothing to\ndo with repentance of letting her go, but was, primarily, a human\ninstinct flying in the face of custom and profession.  He said,\n\"Yes--I shall do that.  I know woman better now.  Whatever justice\nthere was in releasing her, there was little logic, for one holding\nmy views on other subjects.\"\n\nGillingham looked at him, and wondered whether it would ever happen\nthat the reactionary spirit induced by the world's sneers and his own\nphysical wishes would make Phillotson more orthodoxly cruel to her\nthan he had erstwhile been informally and perversely kind.\n\n\"I perceive it won't do to give way to impulse,\" Phillotson resumed,\nfeeling more and more every minute the necessity of acting up to his\nposition.  \"I flew in the face of the Church's teaching; but I did it\nwithout malice prepense.  Women are so strange in their influence\nthat they tempt you to misplaced kindness.  However, I know myself\nbetter now.  A little judicious severity, perhaps...\"\n\n\"Yes; but you must tighten the reins by degrees only.  Don't be too\nstrenuous at first.  She'll come to any terms in time.\"\n\nThe caution was unnecessary, though Phillotson did not say so.  \"I\nremember what my vicar at Shaston said, when I left after the row\nthat was made about my agreeing to her elopement.  'The only thing\nyou can do to retrieve your position and hers is to admit your error\nin not restraining her with a wise and strong hand, and to get her\nback again if she'll come, and be firm in the future.'  But I was\nso headstrong at that time that I paid no heed.  And that after the\ndivorce she should have thought of doing so I did not dream.\"\n\nThe gate of Mrs. Edlin's cottage clicked, and somebody began crossing\nin the direction of the school.  Phillotson said \"Good-night.\"\n\n\"Oh, is that Mr. Phillotson,\" said Mrs. Edlin.  \"I was going over\nto see 'ee.  I've been upstairs with her, helping her to unpack her\nthings; and upon my word, sir, I don't think this ought to be!\"\n\n\"What--the wedding?\"\n\n\"Yes.  She's forcing herself to it, poor dear little thing; and\nyou've no notion what she's suffering.  I was never much for religion\nnor against it, but it can't be right to let her do this, and you\nought to persuade her out of it.  Of course everybody will say it was\nvery good and forgiving of 'ee to take her to 'ee again.  But for my\npart I don't.\"\n\n\"It's her wish, and I am willing,\" said Phillotson with grave\nreserve, opposition making him illogically tenacious now.  \"A great\npiece of laxity will be rectified.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it.  She's his wife if anybody's.  She's had three\nchildren by him, and he loves her dearly; and it's a wicked shame to\negg her on to this, poor little quivering thing!  She's got nobody\non her side.  The one man who'd be her friend the obstinate creature\nwon't allow to come near her.  What first put her into this mood o'\nmind, I wonder!\"\n\n\"I can't tell.  Not I certainly.  It is all voluntary on her part.\nNow that's all I have to say.\"  Phillotson spoke stiffly.  \"You've\nturned round, Mrs. Edlin.  It is unseemly of you!\"\n\n\"Well, I knowed you'd be affronted at what I had to say; but I don't\nmind that.  The truth's the truth.\"\n\n\"I'm not affronted, Mrs. Edlin.  You've been too kind a neighbour\nfor that.  But I must be allowed to know what's best for myself and\nSusanna.  I suppose you won't go to church with us, then?\"\n\n\"No.  Be hanged if I can...  I don't know what the times be coming\nto!  Matrimony have growed to be that serious in these days that one\nreally do feel afeard to move in it at all.  In my time we took it\nmore careless; and I don't know that we was any the worse for it!\nWhen I and my poor man were jined in it we kept up the junketing all\nthe week, and drunk the parish dry, and had to borrow half a crown\nto begin housekeeping!\"\n\nWhen Mrs. Edlin had gone back to her cottage Phillotson spoke\nmoodily.  \"I don't know whether I ought to do it--at any rate quite\nso rapidly.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"If she is really compelling herself to this against her\ninstincts--merely from this new sense of duty or religion--I ought\nperhaps to let her wait a bit.\"\n\n\"Now you've got so far you ought not to back out of it.  That's my\nopinion.\"\n\n\"I can't very well put it off now; that's true.  But I had a qualm\nwhen she gave that little cry at sight of the licence.\"\n\n\"Now, never you have qualms, old boy.  I mean to give her away\nto-morrow morning, and you mean to take her.  It has always been on\nmy conscience that I didn't urge more objections to your letting her\ngo, and now we've got to this stage I shan't be content if I don't\nhelp you to set the matter right.\"\n\nPhillotson nodded, and seeing how staunch his friend was, became\nmore frank.  \"No doubt when it gets known what I've done I shall\nbe thought a soft fool by many.  But they don't know Sue as I do.\nThough so elusive, hers is such an honest nature at bottom that I\ndon't think she has ever done anything against her conscience.  The\nfact of her having lived with Fawley goes for nothing.  At the time\nshe left me for him she thought she was quite within her right.  Now\nshe thinks otherwise.\"\n\nThe next morning came, and the self-sacrifice of the woman on the\naltar of what she was pleased to call her principles was acquiesced\nin by these two friends, each from his own point of view.  Phillotson\nwent across to the Widow Edlin's to fetch Sue a few minutes after\neight o'clock.  The fog of the previous day or two on the low-lands\nhad travelled up here by now, and the trees on the green caught\narmfuls, and turned them into showers of big drops.  The bride was\nwaiting, ready; bonnet and all on.  She had never in her life looked\nso much like the lily her name connoted as she did in that pallid\nmorning light.  Chastened, world-weary, remorseful, the strain on her\nnerves had preyed upon her flesh and bones, and she appeared smaller\nin outline than she had formerly done, though Sue had not been a\nlarge woman in her days of rudest health.\n\n\"Prompt,\" said the schoolmaster, magnanimously taking her hand.\nBut he checked his impulse to kiss her, remembering her start of\nyesterday, which unpleasantly lingered in his mind.\n\nGillingham joined them, and they left the house, Widow Edlin\ncontinuing steadfast in her refusal to assist in the ceremony.\n\n\"Where is the church?\" said Sue.  She had not lived there for any\nlength of time since the old church was pulled down, and in her\npreoccupation forgot the new one.\n\n\"Up here,\" said Phillotson; and presently the tower loomed large and\nsolemn in the fog.  The vicar had already crossed to the building,\nand when they entered he said pleasantly: \"We almost want candles.\"\n\n\"You do--wish me to be yours, Richard?\" gasped Sue in a whisper.\n\n\"Certainly, dear; above all things in the world.\"\n\nSue said no more; and for the second or third time he felt he was not\nquite following out the humane instinct which had induced him to let\nher go.\n\nThere they stood, five altogether: the parson, the clerk, the couple,\nand Gillingham; and the holy ordinance was resolemnized forthwith.\nIn the nave of the edifice were two or three villagers, and when the\nclergyman came to the words, \"What God hath joined,\" a woman's voice\nfrom among these was heard to utter audibly:\n\n\"God hath jined indeed!\"\n\nIt was like a re-enactment by the ghosts of their former selves of\nthe similar scene which had taken place at Melchester years before.\nWhen the books were signed the vicar congratulated the husband\nand wife on having performed a noble, and righteous, and mutually\nforgiving act.  \"All's well that ends well,\" he said smiling.\n\"May you long be happy together, after thus having been 'saved as by\nfire.'\"\n\nThey came down the nearly empty building, and crossed to the\nschoolhouse.  Gillingham wanted to get home that night, and left\nearly.  He, too, congratulated the couple.  \"Now,\" he said in parting\nfrom Phillotson, who walked out a little way, \"I shall be able to\ntell the people in your native place a good round tale; and they'll\nall say 'Well done,' depend on it.\"\n\nWhen the schoolmaster got back Sue was making a pretence of doing\nsome housewifery as if she lived there.  But she seemed timid at his\napproach, and compunction wrought on him at sight of it.\n\n\"Of course, my dear, I shan't expect to intrude upon your personal\nprivacy any more than I did before,\" he said gravely.  \"It is for our\ngood socially to do this, and that's its justification, if it was not\nmy reason.\"  Sue brightened a little.\n\n\n\nVI\n\n\nThe place was the door of Jude's lodging in the out-skirts of\nChristminster--far from the precincts of St. Silas' where he had\nformerly lived, which saddened him to sickness.  The rain was coming\ndown.  A woman in shabby black stood on the doorstep talking to Jude,\nwho held the door in his hand.\n\n\"I am lonely, destitute, and houseless--that's what I am!  Father has\nturned me out of doors after borrowing every penny I'd got, to put it\ninto his business, and then accusing me of laziness when I was only\nwaiting for a situation.  I am at the mercy of the world!  If you\ncan't take me and help me, Jude, I must go to the workhouse, or to\nsomething worse.  Only just now two undergraduates winked at me as I\ncame along.  'Tis hard for a woman to keep virtuous where there's so\nmany young men!\"\n\nThe woman in the rain who spoke thus was Arabella, the evening being\nthat of the day after Sue's remarriage with Phillotson.\n\n\"I am sorry for you, but I am only in lodgings,\" said Jude coldly.\n\n\"Then you turn me away?\"\n\n\"I'll give you enough to get food and lodging for a few days.\"\n\n\"Oh, but can't you have the kindness to take me in?  I cannot endure\ngoing to a public house to lodge; and I am so lonely.  Please, Jude,\nfor old times' sake!\"\n\n\"No, no,\" said Jude hastily.  \"I don't want to be reminded of those\nthings; and if you talk about them I shall not help you.\"\n\n\"Then I suppose I must go!\" said Arabella.  She bent her head against\nthe doorpost and began sobbing.\n\n\"The house is full,\" said Jude.  \"And I have only a little extra room\nto my own--not much more than a closet--where I keep my tools, and\ntemplates, and the few books I have left!\"\n\n\"That would be a palace for me!\"\n\n\"There is no bedstead in it.\"\n\n\"A bit of a bed could be made on the floor.  It would be good enough\nfor me.\"\n\nUnable to be harsh with her, and not knowing what to do, Jude called\nthe man who let the lodgings, and said this was an acquaintance of\nhis in great distress for want of temporary shelter.\n\n\"You may remember me as barmaid at the Lamb and Flag formerly?\" spoke\nup Arabella.  \"My father has insulted me this afternoon, and I've\nleft him, though without a penny!\"\n\nThe householder said he could not recall her features.  \"But still,\nif you are a friend of Mr. Fawley's we'll do what we can for a day\nor two--if he'll make himself answerable?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Jude.  \"She has really taken me quite unawares; but\nI should wish to help her out of her difficulty.\"  And an arrangement\nwas ultimately come to under which a bed was to be thrown down in\nJude's lumber-room, to make it comfortable for Arabella till she\ncould get out of the strait she was in--not by her own fault, as she\ndeclared--and return to her father's again.\n\nWhile they were waiting for this to be done Arabella said: \"You know\nthe news, I suppose?\"\n\n\"I guess what you mean; but I know nothing.\"\n\n\"I had a letter from Anny at Alfredston to-day. She had just heard\nthat the wedding was to be yesterday: but she didn't know if it had\ncome off.\"\n\n\"I don't wish to talk of it.\"\n\n\"No, no: of course you don't.  Only it shows what kind of woman--\"\n\n\"Don't speak of her I say!  She's a fool!  And she's an angel, too,\npoor dear!\"\n\n\"If it's done, he'll have a chance of getting back to his old\nposition, by everybody's account, so Anny says.  All his well-wishers\nwill be pleased, including the bishop himself.\"\n\n\"Do spare me, Arabella.\"\n\nArabella was duly installed in the little attic, and at first she\ndid not come near Jude at all.  She went to and fro about her own\nbusiness, which, when they met for a moment on the stairs or in the\npassage, she informed him was that of obtaining another place in\nthe occupation she understood best.  When Jude suggested London as\naffording the most likely opening in the liquor trade, she shook her\nhead.  \"No--the temptations are too many,\" she said. \"Any humble\ntavern in the country before that for me.\"\n\nOn the Sunday morning following, when he breakfasted later than on\nother days, she meekly asked him if she might come in to breakfast\nwith him, as she had broken her teapot, and could not replace it\nimmediately, the shops being shut.\n\n\"Yes, if you like,\" he said indifferently.\n\nWhile they sat without speaking she suddenly observed: \"You seem all\nin a brood, old man.  I'm sorry for you.\"\n\n\"I am all in a brood.\"\n\n\"It is about her, I know.  It's no business of mine, but I could find\nout all about the wedding--if it really did take place--if you wanted\nto know.\"\n\n\"How could you?\"\n\n\"I wanted to go to Alfredston to get a few things I left there.  And\nI could see Anny, who'll be sure to have heard all about it, as she\nhas friends at Marygreen.\"\n\nJude could not bear to acquiesce in this proposal; but his suspense\npitted itself against his discretion, and won in the struggle.  \"You\ncan ask about it if you like,\" he said.  \"I've not heard a sound from\nthere.  It must have been very private, if--they have married.\"\n\n\"I am afraid I haven't enough cash to take me there and back, or I\nshould have gone before.  I must wait till I have earned some.\"\n\n\"Oh--I can pay the journey for you,\" he said impatiently.  And thus\nhis suspense as to Sue's welfare, and the possible marriage, moved\nhim to dispatch for intelligence the last emissary he would have\nthought of choosing deliberately.\n\nArabella went, Jude requesting her to be home not later than by\nthe seven o'clock train.  When she had gone he said: \"Why should I\nhave charged her to be back by a particular time!  She's nothing to\nme--nor the other neither!\"\n\nBut having finished work he could not help going to the station to\nmeet Arabella, dragged thither by feverish haste to get the news\nshe might bring, and know the worst.  Arabella had made dimples\nmost successfully all the way home, and when she stepped out of the\nrailway carriage she smiled.  He merely said \"Well?\" with the very\nreverse of a smile.\n\n\"They are married.\"\n\n\"Yes--of course they are!\" he returned.  She observed, however, the\nhard strain upon his lip as he spoke.\n\n\"Anny says she has heard from Belinda, her relation out at Marygreen,\nthat it was very sad, and curious!\"\n\n\"How do you mean sad?  She wanted to marry him again, didn't she?\nAnd he her!\"\n\n\"Yes--that was it.  She wanted to in one sense, but not in the\nother.  Mrs. Edlin was much upset by it all, and spoke out her mind\nat Phillotson.  But Sue was that excited about it that she burnt her\nbest embroidery that she'd worn with you, to blot you out entirely.\nWell--if a woman feels like it, she ought to do it.  I commend her\nfor it, though others don't.\"  Arabella sighed.  \"She felt he was her\nonly husband, and that she belonged to nobody else in the sight of\nGod A'mighty while he lived.  Perhaps another woman feels the same\nabout herself, too!\"  Arabella sighed again.\n\n\"I don't want any cant!\" exclaimed Jude.\n\n\"It isn't cant,\" said Arabella.  \"I feel exactly the same as she!\"\n\nHe closed that issue by remarking abruptly: \"Well--now I know all I\nwanted to know.  Many thanks for your information.  I am not going\nback to my lodgings just yet.\"  And he left her straightway.\n\nIn his misery and depression Jude walked to well-nigh every spot\nin the city that he had visited with Sue; thence he did not know\nwhither, and then thought of going home to his usual evening meal.\nBut having all the vices of his virtues, and some to spare, he turned\ninto a public house, for the first time during many months.  Among\nthe possible consequences of her marriage Sue had not dwelt on this.\n\nArabella, meanwhile, had gone back.  The evening passed, and Jude\ndid not return.  At half-past nine Arabella herself went out, first\nproceeding to an outlying district near the river where her father\nlived, and had opened a small and precarious pork-shop lately.\n\n\"Well,\" she said to him, \"for all your rowing me that night, I've\ncalled in, for I have something to tell you.  I think I shall get\nmarried and settled again.  Only you must help me: and you can do\nno less, after what I've stood 'ee.\"\n\n\"I'll do anything to get thee off my hands!\"\n\n\"Very well.  I am now going to look for my young man.  He's on the\nloose I'm afraid, and I must get him home.  All I want you to do\nto-night is not to fasten the door, in case I should want to sleep\nhere, and should be late.\"\n\n\"I thought you'd soon get tired of giving yourself airs and keeping\naway!\"\n\n\"Well--don't do the door.  That's all I say.\"\n\nShe then sallied out again, and first hastening back to Jude's to\nmake sure that he had not returned, began her search for him.  A\nshrewd guess as to his probable course took her straight to the\ntavern which Jude had formerly frequented, and where she had been\nbarmaid for a brief term.  She had no sooner opened the door of the\n\"Private Bar\" than her eyes fell upon him--sitting in the shade at\nthe back of the compartment, with his eyes fixed on the floor in a\nblank stare.  He was drinking nothing stronger than ale just then.\nHe did not observe her, and she entered and sat beside him.\n\nJude looked up, and said without surprise: \"You've come to have\nsomething, Arabella? ...  I'm trying to forget her: that's all!  But\nI can't; and I am going home.\"  She saw that he was a little way on\nin liquor, but only a little as yet.\n\n\"I've come entirely to look for you, dear boy.  You are not well.\nNow you must have something better than that.\"  Arabella held up her\nfinger to the barmaid.  \"You shall have a liqueur--that's better fit\nfor a man of education than beer.  You shall have maraschino, or\ncura\u00c3\u00a7ao dry or sweet, or cherry brandy.  I'll treat you, poor chap!\"\n\n\"I don't care which!  Say cherry brandy...  Sue has served me badly,\nvery badly.  I didn't expect it of Sue!  I stuck to her, and she\nought to have stuck to me.  I'd have sold my soul for her sake, but\nshe wouldn't risk hers a jot for me.  To save her own soul she lets\nmine go damn! ...  But it isn't her fault, poor little girl--I am\nsure it isn't!\"\n\nHow Arabella had obtained money did not appear, but she ordered a\nliqueur each, and paid for them.  When they had drunk these Arabella\nsuggested another; and Jude had the pleasure of being, as it were,\npersonally conducted through the varieties of spirituous delectation\nby one who knew the landmarks well.  Arabella kept very considerably\nin the rear of Jude; but though she only sipped where he drank, she\ntook as much as she could safely take without losing her head--which\nwas not a little, as the crimson upon her countenance showed.\n\nHer tone towards him to-night was uniformly soothing and cajoling;\nand whenever he said \"I don't care what happens to me,\" a thing he\ndid continually, she replied, \"But I do very much!\"  The closing hour\ncame, and they were compelled to turn out; whereupon Arabella put her\narm round his waist, and guided his unsteady footsteps.\n\nWhen they were in the streets she said: \"I don't know what our\nlandlord will say to my bringing you home in this state.  I expect we\nare fastened out, so that he'll have to come down and let us in.\"\n\n\"I don't know--I don't know.\"\n\n\"That's the worst of not having a home of your own.  I tell you,\nJude, what we had best do.  Come round to my father's--I made it up\nwith him a bit to-day.  I can let you in, and nobody will see you at\nall; and by to-morrow morning you'll be all right.\"\n\n\"Anything--anywhere,\" replied Jude.  \"What the devil does it matter\nto me?\"\n\nThey went along together, like any other fuddling couple, her arm\nstill round his waist, and his, at last, round hers; though with no\namatory intent; but merely because he was weary, unstable, and in\nneed of support.\n\n\"This--is th' Martyrs'--burning-place,\" he stammered as they\ndragged across a broad street.  \"I remember--in old Fuller's _Holy\nState_--and I am reminded of it--by our passing by here--old Fuller\nin his _Holy State_ says, that at the burning of Ridley, Doctor\nSmith--preached sermon, and took as his text _'Though I give my body\nto be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.'_--Often\nthink of it as I pass here.  Ridley was a--\"\n\n\"Yes.  Exactly.  Very thoughtful of you, deary, even though it hasn't\nmuch to do with our present business.\"\n\n\"Why, yes it has!  I'm giving my body to be burned!  But--ah you\ndon't understand!--it wants Sue to understand such things!  And I\nwas her seducer--poor little girl!  And she's gone--and I don't care\nabout myself!  Do what you like with me! ...  And yet she did it for\nconscience' sake, poor little Sue!\"\n\n\"Hang her!--I mean, I think she was right,\" hiccuped Arabella.  \"I've\nmy feelings too, like her; and I feel I belong to you in Heaven's\neye, and to nobody else, till death us do part!  It is--hic--never\ntoo late--hic to mend!\"\n\nThey had reached her father's house, and she softly unfastened the\ndoor, groping about for a light within.\n\nThe circumstances were not altogether unlike those of their entry\ninto the cottage at Cresscombe, such a long time before.  Nor were\nperhaps Arabella's motives.  But Jude did not think of that, though\nshe did.\n\n\"I can't find the matches, dear,\" she said when she had fastened up\nthe door.  \"But never mind--this way.  As quiet as you can, please.\"\n\n\"It is as dark as pitch,\" said Jude.\n\n\"Give me your hand, and I'll lead you.  That's it.  Just sit down\nhere, and I'll pull off your boots.  I don't want to wake him.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Father.  He'd make a row, perhaps.\"\n\nShe pulled off his boots.  \"Now,\" she whispered, \"take hold of\nme--never mind your weight.  Now--first stair, second stair--\"\n\n\"But--are we out in our old house by Marygreen?\" asked the stupefied\nJude.  \"I haven't been inside it for years till now!  Hey?  And where\nare my books?  That's what I want to know?\"\n\n\"We are at my house, dear, where there's nobody to spy out how ill\nyou are.  Now--third stair, fourth stair--that's it.  Now we shall\nget on.\"\n\n\n\nVII\n\n\nArabella was preparing breakfast in the downstairs back room of this\nsmall, recently hired tenement of her father's.  She put her head\ninto the little pork-shop in front, and told Mr. Donn it was ready.\nDonn, endeavouring to look like a master pork-butcher, in a greasy\nblue blouse, and with a strap round his waist from which a steel\ndangled, came in promptly.\n\n\"You must mind the shop this morning,\" he said casually.  \"I've to\ngo and get some inwards and half a pig from Lumsdon, and to call\nelsewhere.  If you live here you must put your shoulder to the wheel,\nat least till I get the business started!\"\n\n\"Well, for to-day I can't say.\"  She looked deedily into his face.\n\"I've got a prize upstairs.\"\n\n\"Oh?  What's that?\"\n\n\"A husband--almost.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"Yes.  It's Jude.  He's come back to me.\"\n\n\"Your old original one?  Well, I'm damned!\"\n\n\"Well, I always did like him, that I will say.\"\n\n\"But how does he come to be up there?\" said Donn, humour-struck, and\nnodding to the ceiling.\n\n\"Don't ask inconvenient questions, Father.  What we've to do is to\nkeep him here till he and I are--as we were.\"\n\n\"How was that?\"\n\n\"Married.\"\n\n\"Ah...  Well it is the rummest thing I ever heard of--marrying an\nold husband again, and so much new blood in the world!  He's no\ncatch, to my thinking.  I'd have had a new one while I was about it.\"\n\n\"It isn't rum for a woman to want her old husband back for\nrespectability, though for a man to want his old wife back--well,\nperhaps it is funny, rather!\"  And Arabella was suddenly seized with\na fit of loud laughter, in which her father joined more moderately.\n\n\"Be civil to him, and I'll do the rest,\" she said when she had\nrecovered seriousness.  \"He told me this morning that his head ached\nfit to burst, and he hardly seemed to know where he was.  And no\nwonder, considering how he mixed his drink last night.  We must keep\nhim jolly and cheerful here for a day or two, and not let him go back\nto his lodging.  Whatever you advance I'll pay back to you again.\nBut I must go up and see how he is now, poor deary.\"\n\nArabella ascended the stairs, softly opened the door of the first\nbedroom, and peeped in.  Finding that her shorn Samson was asleep\nshe entered to the bedside and stood regarding him.  The fevered\nflush on his face from the debauch of the previous evening lessened\nthe fragility of his ordinary appearance, and his long lashes,\ndark brows, and curly back hair and beard against the white pillow\ncompleted the physiognomy of one whom Arabella, as a woman of rank\npassions, still felt it worth while to recapture, highly important\nto recapture as a woman straitened both in means and in reputation.\nHer ardent gaze seemed to affect him; his quick breathing became\nsuspended, and he opened his eyes.\n\n\"How are you now, dear?\" said she.  \"It is I--Arabella.\"\n\n\"Ah!--where--oh yes, I remember!  You gave me shelter...  I am\nstranded--ill--demoralized--damn bad!  That's what I am!\"\n\n\"Then do stay here.  There's nobody in the house but father and me,\nand you can rest till you are thoroughly well.  I'll tell them at\nthe stoneworks that you are knocked up.\"\n\n\"I wonder what they are thinking at the lodgings!\"\n\n\"I'll go round and explain.  Perhaps you had better let me pay up, or\nthey'll think we've run away?\"\n\n\"Yes.  You'll find enough money in my pocket there.\"\n\nQuite indifferent, and shutting his eyes because he could not bear\nthe daylight in his throbbing eye-balls, Jude seemed to doze again.\nArabella took his purse, softly left the room, and putting on her\noutdoor things went off to the lodgings she and he had quitted the\nevening before.\n\nScarcely half an hour had elapsed ere she reappeared round the\ncorner, walking beside a lad wheeling a truck on which were piled all\nJude's household possessions, and also the few of Arabella's things\nwhich she had taken to the lodging for her short sojourn there.\nJude was in such physical pain from his unfortunate break-down of\nthe previous night, and in such mental pain from the loss of Sue and\nfrom having yielded in his half-somnolent state to Arabella, that\nwhen he saw his few chattels unpacked and standing before his eyes in\nthis strange bedroom, intermixed with woman's apparel, he scarcely\nconsidered how they had come there, or what their coming signalized.\n\n\"Now,\" said Arabella to her father downstairs, \"we must keep plenty\nof good liquor going in the house these next few days.  I know his\nnature, and if he once gets into that fearfully low state that he\ndoes get into sometimes, he'll never do the honourable thing by me\nin this world, and I shall be left in the lurch.  He must be kept\ncheerful.  He has a little money in the savings bank, and he has\ngiven me his purse to pay for anything necessary.  Well, that will\nbe the licence; for I must have that ready at hand, to catch him\nthe moment he's in the humour.  You must pay for the liquor.  A few\nfriends, and a quiet convivial party would be the thing, if we could\nget it up.  It would advertise the shop, and help me too.\"\n\n\"That can be got up easy enough by anybody who'll afford victuals and\ndrink...  Well yes--it would advertise the shop--that's true.\"\n\nThree days later, when Jude had recovered somewhat from the fearful\nthrobbing of his eyes and brain, but was still considerably confused\nin his mind by what had been supplied to him by Arabella during\nthe interval--to keep him, jolly, as she expressed it--the quiet\nconvivial gathering, suggested by her, to wind Jude up to the\nstriking point, took place.\n\nDonn had only just opened his miserable little pork and sausage\nshop, which had as yet scarce any customers; nevertheless that party\nadvertised it well, and the Donns acquired a real notoriety among a\ncertain class in Christminster who knew not the colleges, nor their\nworks, nor their ways.  Jude was asked if he could suggest any guest\nin addition to those named by Arabella and her father, and in a\nsaturnine humour of perfect recklessness mentioned Uncle Joe, and\nStagg, and the decayed auctioneer, and others whom he remembered as\nhaving been frequenters of the well-known tavern during his bout\ntherein years before.  He also suggested Freckles and Bower o' Bliss.\nArabella took him at his word so far as the men went, but drew the\nline at the ladies.\n\nAnother man they knew, Tinker Taylor, though he lived in the same\nstreet, was not invited; but as he went homeward from a late job on\nthe evening of the party, he had occasion to call at the shop for\ntrotters.  There were none in, but he was promised some the next\nmorning.  While making his inquiry Taylor glanced into the back room,\nand saw the guests sitting round, card-playing, and drinking, and\notherwise enjoying themselves at Donn's expense.  He went home to\nbed, and on his way out next morning wondered how the party went\noff.  He thought it hardly worth while to call at the shop for his\nprovisions at that hour, Donn and his daughter being probably not up,\nif they caroused late the night before.  However, he found in passing\nthat the door was open, and he could hear voices within, though the\nshutters of the meat-stall were not down.  He went and tapped at the\nsitting-room door, and opened it.\n\n\"Well--to be sure!\" he said, astonished.\n\nHosts and guests were sitting card-playing, smoking, and talking,\nprecisely as he had left them eleven hours earlier; the gas was\nburning and the curtains drawn, though it had been broad daylight\nfor two hours out of doors.\n\n\"Yes!\" cried Arabella, laughing.  \"Here we are, just the same.  We\nought to be ashamed of ourselves, oughtn't we?  But it is a sort of\nhousewarming, you see; and our friends are in no hurry.  Come in, Mr.\nTaylor, and sit down.\"\n\nThe tinker, or rather reduced ironmonger, was nothing loath, and\nentered and took a seat.  \"I shall lose a quarter, but never mind,\"\nhe said.  \"Well, really, I could hardly believe my eyes when I looked\nin!  It seemed as if I was flung back again into last night, all of a\nsudden.\"\n\n\"So you are.  Pour out for Mr. Taylor.\"\n\nHe now perceived that she was sitting beside Jude, her arm being\nround his waist.  Jude, like the rest of the company, bore on his\nface the signs of how deeply he had been indulging.\n\n\"Well, we've been waiting for certain legal hours to arrive, to\ntell the truth,\" she continued bashfully, and making her spirituous\ncrimson look as much like a maiden blush as possible.  \"Jude and I\nhave decided to make up matters between us by tying the knot again,\nas we find we can't do without one another after all.  So, as a\nbright notion, we agreed to sit on till it was late enough, and go\nand do it off-hand.\"\n\nJude seemed to pay no great heed to what she was announcing, or\nindeed to anything whatever.  The entrance of Taylor infused fresh\nspirit into the company, and they remained sitting, till Arabella\nwhispered to her father: \"Now we may as well go.\"\n\n\"But the parson don't know?\"\n\n\"Yes, I told him last night that we might come between eight and\nnine, as there were reasons of decency for doing it as early and\nquiet as possible; on account of it being our second marriage, which\nmight make people curious to look on if they knew.  He highly\napproved.\"\n\n\"Oh very well, I'm ready,\" said her father, getting up and shaking\nhimself.\n\n\"Now, old darling,\" she said to Jude.  \"Come along, as you promised.\"\n\n\"When did I promise anything?\" asked he, whom she had made so tipsy\nby her special knowledge of that line of business as almost to have\nmade him sober again--or to seem so to those who did not know him.\n\n\"Why!\" said Arabella, affecting dismay.  \"You've promised to marry me\nseveral times as we've sat here to-night. These gentlemen have heard\nyou.\"\n\n\"I don't remember it,\" said Jude doggedly.  \"There's only one\nwoman--but I won't mention her in this Capharnaum!\"\n\nArabella looked towards her father.  \"Now, Mr. Fawley be honourable,\"\nsaid Donn.  \"You and my daughter have been living here together these\nthree or four days, quite on the understanding that you were going to\nmarry her.  Of course I shouldn't have had such goings on in my house\nif I hadn't understood that.  As a point of honour you must do it\nnow.\"\n\n\"Don't say anything against my honour!\" enjoined Jude hotly,\nstanding up.  \"I'd marry the W---- of Babylon rather than do\nanything dishonourable!  No reflection on you, my dear.  It is a\nmere rhetorical figure--what they call in the books, hyperbole.\"\n\n\"Keep your figures for your debts to friends who shelter you,\" said\nDonn.\n\n\"If I am bound in honour to marry her--as I suppose I am--though\nhow I came to be here with her I know no more than a dead man--marry\nher I will, so help me God!  I have never behaved dishonourably to\na woman or to any living thing.  I am not a man who wants to save\nhimself at the expense of the weaker among us!\"\n\n\"There--never mind him, deary,\" said she, putting her cheek against\nJude's.  \"Come up and wash your face, and just put yourself tidy, and\noff we'll go.  Make it up with Father.\"\n\nThey shook hands.  Jude went upstairs with her, and soon came down\nlooking tidy and calm.  Arabella, too, had hastily arranged herself,\nand accompanied by Donn away they went.\n\n\"Don't go,\" she said to the guests at parting.  \"I've told the little\nmaid to get the breakfast while we are gone; and when we come back\nwe'll all have some.  A good strong cup of tea will set everybody\nright for going home.\"\n\n\n\nWhen Arabella, Jude, and Donn had disappeared on their matrimonial\nerrand the assembled guests yawned themselves wider awake, and\ndiscussed the situation with great interest.  Tinker Taylor, being\nthe most sober, reasoned the most lucidly.\n\n\"I don't wish to speak against friends,\" he said.  \"But it do seem a\nrare curiosity for a couple to marry over again!  If they couldn't\nget on the first time when their minds were limp, they won't the\nsecond, by my reckoning.\"\n\n\"Do you think he'll do it?\"\n\n\"He's been put upon his honour by the woman, so he med.\"\n\n\"He'd hardly do it straight off like this.  He's got no licence nor\nanything.\"\n\n\"She's got that, bless you.  Didn't you hear her say so to her\nfather?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Tinker Taylor, relighting his pipe at the gas-jet.\n\"Take her all together, limb by limb, she's not such a bad-looking\npiece--particular by candlelight.  To be sure, halfpence that have\nbeen in circulation can't be expected to look like new ones from\nthe mint.  But for a woman that's been knocking about the four\nhemispheres for some time, she's passable enough.  A little bit thick\nin the flitch perhaps: but I like a woman that a puff o' wind won't\nblow down.\"\n\nTheir eyes followed the movements of the little girl as she spread\nthe breakfast-cloth on the table they had been using, without wiping\nup the slops of the liquor.  The curtains were undrawn, and the\nexpression of the house made to look like morning.  Some of the\nguests, however, fell asleep in their chairs.  One or two went to the\ndoor, and gazed along the street more than once.  Tinker Taylor was\nthe chief of these, and after a time he came in with a leer on his\nface.\n\n\"By Gad, they are coming!  I think the deed's done!\"\n\n\"No,\" said Uncle Joe, following him in.  \"Take my word, he turned\nrusty at the last minute.  They are walking in a very unusual way;\nand that's the meaning of it!\"\n\nThey waited in silence till the wedding-party could be heard entering\nthe house.  First into the room came Arabella boisterously; and her\nface was enough to show that her strategy had succeeded.\n\n\"Mrs. Fawley, I presume?\" said Tinker Taylor with mock courtesy.\n\n\"Certainly.  Mrs. Fawley again,\" replied Arabella blandly, pulling\noff her glove and holding out her left hand.  \"There's the padlock,\nsee...  Well, he was a very nice, gentlemanly man indeed.  I mean\nthe clergyman.  He said to me as gentle as a babe when all was done:\n'Mrs. Fawley, I congratulate you heartily,' he says.  'For having\nheard your history, and that of your husband, I think you have both\ndone the right and proper thing.  And for your past errors as a wife,\nand his as a husband, I think you ought now to be forgiven by the\nworld, as you have forgiven each other,' says he.  Yes; he was a very\nnice, gentlemanly man.  'The Church don't recognize divorce in her\ndogma, strictly speaking,' he says: 'and bear in mind the words of\nthe service in your goings out and your comings in: What God hath\njoined together let no man put asunder.'  Yes; he was a very nice,\ngentlemanly man...  But, Jude, my dear, you were enough to make a cat\nlaugh!  You walked that straight, and held yourself that steady, that\none would have thought you were going 'prentice to a judge; though I\nknew you were seeing double all the time, from the way you fumbled\nwith my finger.\"\n\n\"I said I'd do anything to--save a woman's honour,\" muttered Jude.\n\"And I've done it!\"\n\n\"Well now, old deary, come along and have some breakfast.\"\n\n\"I want--some--more whisky,\" said Jude stolidly.\n\n\"Nonsense, dear.  Not now!  There's no more left.  The tea will take\nthe muddle out of our heads, and we shall be as fresh as larks.\"\n\n\"All right.  I've--married you.  She said I ought to marry you again,\nand I have straightway.  It is true religion!  Ha--ha--ha!\"\n\n\n\nVIII\n\n\nMichaelmas came and passed, and Jude and his wife, who had lived but\na short time in her father's house after their remarriage, were in\nlodgings on the top floor of a dwelling nearer to the centre of the\ncity.\n\nHe had done a few days' work during the two or three months since\nthe event, but his health had been indifferent, and it was now\nprecarious.  He was sitting in an arm-chair before the fire, and\ncoughed a good deal.\n\n\"I've got a bargain for my trouble in marrying thee over\nagain!\" Arabella was saying to him.  \"I shall have to keep 'ee\nentirely--that's what 'twill come to!  I shall have to make black-pot\nand sausages, and hawk 'em about the street, all to support an\ninvalid husband I'd no business to be saddled with at all.  Why\ndidn't you keep your health, deceiving one like this?  You were well\nenough when the wedding was!\"\n\n\"Ah, yes!\" said he, laughing acridly.  \"I have been thinking of\nmy foolish feeling about the pig you and I killed during our\nfirst marriage.  I feel now that the greatest mercy that could be\nvouchsafed to me would be that something should serve me as I served\nthat animal.\"\n\nThis was the sort of discourse that went on between them every day\nnow.  The landlord of the lodging, who had heard that they were a\nqueer couple, had doubted if they were married at all, especially\nas he had seen Arabella kiss Jude one evening when she had taken a\nlittle cordial; and he was about to give them notice to quit, till by\nchance overhearing her one night haranguing Jude in rattling terms,\nand ultimately flinging a shoe at his head, he recognized the note of\ngenuine wedlock; and concluding that they must be respectable, said\nno more.\n\nJude did not get any better, and one day he requested Arabella, with\nconsiderable hesitation, to execute a commission for him.  She asked\nhim indifferently what it was.\n\n\"To write to Sue.\"\n\n\"What in the name--do you want me to write to her for?\"\n\n\"To ask how she is, and if she'll come to see me, because I'm ill,\nand should like to see her--once again.\"\n\n\"It is like you to insult a lawful wife by asking such a thing!\"\n\n\"It is just in order not to insult you that I ask you to do it.  You\nknow I love Sue.  I don't wish to mince the matter--there stands the\nfact: I love her.  I could find a dozen ways of sending a letter to\nher without your knowledge.  But I wish to be quite above-board with\nyou, and with her husband.  A message through you asking her to come\nis at least free from any odour of intrigue.  If she retains any of\nher old nature at all, she'll come.\"\n\n\"You've no respect for marriage whatever, or its rights and duties!\"\n\n\"What DOES it matter what my opinions are--a wretch like me!  Can\nit matter to anybody in the world who comes to see me for half an\nhour--here with one foot in the grave! ...  Come, please write,\nArabella!\" he pleaded.  \"Repay my candour by a little generosity!\"\n\n\"I should think NOT!\"\n\n\"Not just once?--Oh do!\"  He felt that his physical weakness had\ntaken away all his dignity.\n\n\"What do you want HER to know how you are for?  She don't want to see\n'ee.  She's the rat that forsook the sinking ship!\"\n\n\"Don't, don't!\"\n\n\"And I stuck to un--the more fool I!  Have that strumpet in the house\nindeed!\"\n\nAlmost as soon as the words were spoken Jude sprang from the chair,\nand before Arabella knew where she was he had her on her back upon a\nlittle couch which stood there, he kneeling above her.\n\n\"Say another word of that sort,\" he whispered, \"and I'll kill\nyou--here and now!  I've everything to gain by it--my own death not\nbeing the least part.  So don't think there's no meaning in what I\nsay!\"\n\n\"What do you want me to do?\" gasped Arabella.\n\n\"Promise never to speak of her.\"\n\n\"Very well.  I do.\"\n\n\"I take your word,\" he said scornfully as he loosened her.  \"But what\nit is worth I can't say.\"\n\n\"You couldn't kill the pig, but you could kill me!\"\n\n\"Ah--there you have me!  No--I couldn't kill you--even in a passion.\nTaunt away!\"\n\nHe then began coughing very much, and she estimated his life with an\nappraiser's eye as he sank back ghastly pale.  \"I'll send for her,\"\nArabella murmured, \"if you'll agree to my being in the room with you\nall the time she's here.\"\n\nThe softer side of his nature, the desire to see Sue, made him unable\nto resist the offer even now, provoked as he had been; and he replied\nbreathlessly: \"Yes, I agree.  Only send for her!\"\n\nIn the evening he inquired if she had written.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said; \"I wrote a note telling her you were ill, and asking\nher to come to-morrow or the day after.  I haven't posted it yet.\"\n\nThe next day Jude wondered if she really did post it, but would not\nask her; and foolish Hope, that lives on a drop and a crumb, made him\nrestless with expectation.  He knew the times of the possible trains,\nand listened on each occasion for sounds of her.\n\nShe did not come; but Jude would not address Arabella again thereon.\nHe hoped and expected all the next day; but no Sue appeared; neither\nwas there any note of reply.  Then Jude decided in the privacy of his\nmind that Arabella had never posted hers, although she had written\nit.  There was something in her manner which told it.  His physical\nweakness was such that he shed tears at the disappointment when she\nwas not there to see.  His suspicions were, in fact, well founded.\nArabella, like some other nurses, thought that your duty towards your\ninvalid was to pacify him by any means short of really acting upon\nhis fancies.\n\nHe never said another word to her about his wish or his conjecture.\nA silent, undiscerned resolve grew up in him, which gave him, if not\nstrength, stability and calm.  One midday when, after an absence of\ntwo hours, she came into the room, she beheld the chair empty.\n\nDown she flopped on the bed, and sitting, meditated.  \"Now where the\ndevil is my man gone to!\" she said.\n\nA driving rain from the north-east had been falling with more or less\nintermission all the morning, and looking from the window at the\ndripping spouts it seemed impossible to believe that any sick man\nwould have ventured out to almost certain death.  Yet a conviction\npossessed Arabella that he had gone out, and it became a certainty\nwhen she had searched the house.  \"If he's such a fool, let him be!\"\nshe said.  \"I can do no more.\"\n\nJude was at that moment in a railway train that was drawing near to\nAlfredston, oddly swathed, pale as a monumental figure in alabaster,\nand much stared at by other passengers.  An hour later his thin form,\nin the long great-coat and blanket he had come with, but without an\numbrella, could have been seen walking along the five-mile road to\nMarygreen.  On his face showed the determined purpose that alone\nsustained him, but to which has weakness afforded a sorry foundation.\nBy the up-hill walk he was quite blown, but he pressed on; and at\nhalf-past three o'clock stood by the familiar well at Marygreen.\nThe rain was keeping everybody indoors; Jude crossed the green to the\nchurch without observation, and found the building open.  Here he\nstood, looking forth at the school, whence he could hear the usual\nsing-song tones of the little voices that had not learnt Creation's\ngroan.\n\nHe waited till a small boy came from the school--one evidently\nallowed out before hours for some reason or other.  Jude held up his\nhand, and the child came.\n\n\"Please call at the schoolhouse and ask Mrs. Phillotson if she will\nbe kind enough to come to the church for a few minutes.\"\n\nThe child departed, and Jude heard him knock at the door of the\ndwelling.  He himself went further into the church.  Everything\nwas new, except a few pieces of carving preserved from the wrecked\nold fabric, now fixed against the new walls.  He stood by these:\nthey seemed akin to the perished people of that place who were his\nancestors and Sue's.\n\nA light footstep, which might have been accounted no more than an\nadded drip to the rainfall, sounded in the porch, and he looked\nround.\n\n\"Oh--I didn't think it was you!  I didn't--Oh, Jude!\"  A hysterical\ncatch in her breath ended in a succession of them.  He advanced, but\nshe quickly recovered and went back.\n\n\"Don't go--don't go!\" he implored.  \"This is my last time!  I thought\nit would be less intrusive than to enter your house.  And I shall\nnever come again.  Don't then be unmerciful.  Sue, Sue!  We are\nacting by the letter; and 'the letter killeth'!\"\n\n\"I'll stay--I won't be unkind!\" she said, her mouth quivering and her\ntears flowing as she allowed him to come closer.  \"But why did you\ncome, and do this wrong thing, after doing such a right thing as you\nhave done?\"\n\n\"What right thing?\"\n\n\"Marrying Arabella again.  It was in the Alfredston paper.  She has\nnever been other than yours, Jude--in a proper sense.  And therefore\nyou did so well--Oh so well!--in recognizing it--and taking her to\nyou again.\"\n\n\"God above--and is that all I've come to hear?  If there is anything\nmore degrading, immoral, unnatural, than another in my life, it is\nthis meretricious contract with Arabella which has been called doing\nthe right thing!  And you too--you call yourself Phillotson's wife!\nHIS wife!  You are mine.\"\n\n\"Don't make me rush away from you--I can't bear much!  But on this\npoint I am decided.\"\n\n\"I cannot understand how you did it--how you think it--I cannot!\"\n\n\"Never mind that.  He is a kind husband to me--And I--I've wrestled\nand struggled, and fasted, and prayed.  I have nearly brought my body\ninto complete subjection.  And you mustn't--will you--wake--\"\n\n\"Oh you darling little fool; where is your reason?  You seem to have\nsuffered the loss of your faculties!  I would argue with you if I\ndidn't know that a woman in your state of feeling is quite beyond all\nappeals to her brains.  Or is it that you are humbugging yourself, as\nso many women do about these things; and don't actually believe what\nyou pretend to, and only are indulging in the luxury of the emotion\nraised by an affected belief?\"\n\n\"Luxury!  How can you be so cruel!\"\n\n\"You dear, sad, soft, most melancholy wreck of a promising human\nintellect that it has ever been my lot to behold!  Where is your\nscorn of convention gone?  I WOULD have died game!\"\n\n\"You crush, almost insult me, Jude!  Go away from me!\"  She turned\noff quickly.\n\n\"I will.  I would never come to see you again, even if I had the\nstrength to come, which I shall not have any more.  Sue, Sue, you are\nnot worth a man's love!\"\n\nHer bosom began to go up and down.  \"I can't endure you to say that!\"\nshe burst out, and her eye resting on him a moment, she turned back\nimpulsively.  \"Don't, don't scorn me!  Kiss me, oh kiss me lots\nof times, and say I am not a coward and a contemptible humbug--I\ncan't bear it!\"  She rushed up to him and, with her mouth on his,\ncontinued: \"I must tell you--oh I must--my darling Love!  It has\nbeen--only a church marriage--an apparent marriage I mean!  He\nsuggested it at the very first!\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"I mean it is a nominal marriage only.  It hasn't been more than that\nat all since I came back to him!\"\n\n\"Sue!\" he said.  Pressing her to him in his arms, he bruised her\nlips with kisses. \"If misery can know happiness, I have a moment's\nhappiness now!  Now, in the name of all you hold holy, tell me the\ntruth, and no lie.  You do love me still?\"\n\n\"I do!  You know it too well! ...  But I MUSTN'T do this!  I mustn't\nkiss you back as I would!\"\n\n\"But do!\"\n\n\"And yet you are so dear!--and you look so ill--\"\n\n\"And so do you!  There's one more, in memory of our dead little\nchildren--yours and mine!\"\n\nThe words struck her like a blow, and she bent her head.  \"I\nMUSTN'T--I CAN'T go on with this!\" she gasped presently.  \"But there,\nthere, darling; I give you back your kisses; I do, I do! ...  And now\nI'll HATE myself for ever for my sin!\"\n\n\"No--let me make my last appeal.  Listen to this!  We've both\nremarried out of our senses.  I was made drunk to do it.  You were\nthe same.  I was gin-drunk; you were creed-drunk.  Either form of\nintoxication takes away the nobler vision...  Let us then shake off\nour mistakes, and run away together!\"\n\n\"No; again no! ...  Why do you tempt me so far, Jude!  It is too\nmerciless! ...  But I've got over myself now.  Don't follow me--don't\nlook at me.  Leave me, for pity's sake!\"\n\nShe ran up the church to the east end, and Jude did as she requested.\nHe did not turn his head, but took up his blanket, which she had not\nseen, and went straight out.  As he passed the end of the church she\nheard his coughs mingling with the rain on the windows, and in a last\ninstinct of human affection, even now unsubdued by her fetters, she\nsprang up as if to go and succour him.  But she knelt down again, and\nstopped her ears with her hands till all possible sound of him had\npassed away.\n\nHe was by this time at the corner of the green, from which the path\nran across the fields in which he had scared rooks as a boy.  He\nturned and looked back, once, at the building which still contained\nSue; and then went on, knowing that his eyes would light on that\nscene no more.\n\nThere are cold spots up and down Wessex in autumn and winter weather;\nbut the coldest of all when a north or east wind is blowing is the\ncrest of the down by the Brown House, where the road to Alfredston\ncrosses the old Ridgeway.  Here the first winter sleets and snows\nfall and lie, and here the spring frost lingers last unthawed.  Here\nin the teeth of the north-east wind and rain Jude now pursued his\nway, wet through, the necessary slowness of his walk from lack of his\nformer strength being insufficent to maintain his heat.  He came to\nthe milestone, and, raining as it was, spread his blanket and lay\ndown there to rest.  Before moving on he went and felt at the back\nof the stone for his own carving.  It was still there; but nearly\nobliterated by moss.  He passed the spot where the gibbet of his\nancestor and Sue's had stood, and descended the hill.\n\nIt was dark when he reached Alfredston, where he had a cup of tea,\nthe deadly chill that began to creep into his bones being too much\nfor him to endure fasting.  To get home he had to travel by a steam\ntram-car, and two branches of railway, with much waiting at a\njunction.  He did not reach Christminster till ten o'clock.\n\n\n\nIX\n\n\nOn the platform stood Arabella.  She looked him up and down.\n\n\"You've been to see her?\" she asked.\n\n\"I have,\" said Jude, literally tottering with cold and lassitude.\n\n\"Well, now you'd best march along home.\"\n\nThe water ran out of him as he went, and he was compelled to lean\nagainst the wall to support himself while coughing.\n\n\"You've done for yourself by this, young man,\" said she.  \"I don't\nknow whether you know it.\"\n\n\"Of course I do.  I meant to do for myself.\"\n\n\"What--to commit suicide?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm blest!  Kill yourself for a woman.\"\n\n\"Listen to me, Arabella.  You think you are the stronger; and so\nyou are, in a physical sense, now.  You could push me over like a\nnine-pin.  You did not send that letter the other day, and I could\nnot resent your conduct.  But I am not so weak in another way as\nyou think.  I made up my mind that a man confined to his room by\ninflammation of the lungs, a fellow who had only two wishes left in\nthe world, to see a particular woman, and then to die, could neatly\naccomplish those two wishes at one stroke by taking this journey in\nthe rain.  That I've done.  I have seen her for the last time, and\nI've finished myself--put an end to a feverish life which ought never\nto have been begun!\"\n\n\"Lord--you do talk lofty!  Won't you have something warm to drink?\"\n\n\"No thank you.  Let's get home.\"\n\nThey went along by the silent colleges, and Jude kept stopping.\n\n\"What are you looking at?\"\n\n\"Stupid fancies.  I see, in a way, those spirits of the dead again,\non this my last walk, that I saw when I first walked here!\"\n\n\"What a curious chap you are!\"\n\n\"I seem to see them, and almost hear them rustling.  But I don't\nrevere all of them as I did then.  I don't believe in half of them.\nThe theologians, the apologists, and their kin the metaphysicians,\nthe high-handed statesmen, and others, no longer interest me.  All\nthat has been spoilt for me by the grind of stern reality!\"\n\nThe expression of Jude's corpselike face in the watery lamplight was\nindeed as if he saw people where there was nobody.  At moments he\nstood still by an archway, like one watching a figure walk out; then\nhe would look at a window like one discerning a familiar face behind\nit.  He seemed to hear voices, whose words he repeated as if to\ngather their meaning.\n\n\"They seem laughing at me!\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Oh--I was talking to myself!  The phantoms all about here, in the\ncollege archways, and windows.  They used to look friendly in the old\ndays, particularly Addison, and Gibbon, and Johnson, and Dr. Browne,\nand Bishop Ken--\"\n\n\"Come along do!  Phantoms!  There's neither living nor dead\nhereabouts except a damn policeman!  I never saw the streets\nemptier.\"\n\n\"Fancy!  The Poet of Liberty used to walk here, and the great\nDissector of Melancholy there!\"\n\n\"I don't want to hear about 'em!  They bore me.\"\n\n\"Walter Raleigh is beckoning to me from that lane--Wycliffe--Harvey--\nHooker--Arnold--and a whole crowd of Tractarian Shades--\"\n\n\"I DON'T WANT to know their names, I tell you!  What do I care about\nfolk dead and gone?  Upon my soul you are more sober when you've been\ndrinking than when you have not!\"\n\n\"I must rest a moment,\" he said; and as he paused, holding to the\nrailings, he measured with his eye the height of a college front.\n\"This is old Rubric.  And that Sarcophagus; and up that lane Crozier\nand Tudor: and all down there is Cardinal with its long front, and\nits windows with lifted eyebrows, representing the polite surprise of\nthe university at the efforts of such as I.\"\n\n\"Come along, and I'll treat you!\"\n\n\"Very well.  It will help me home, for I feel the chilly fog from\nthe meadows of Cardinal as if death-claws were grabbing me through\nand through.  As Antigone said, I am neither a dweller among men nor\nghosts.  But, Arabella, when I am dead, you'll see my spirit flitting\nup and down here among these!\"\n\n\"Pooh!  You mayn't die after all.  You are tough enough yet, old\nman.\"\n\n\n\nIt was night at Marygreen, and the rain of the afternoon showed no\nsign of abatement.  About the time at which Jude and Arabella were\nwalking the streets of Christminster homeward, the Widow Edlin\ncrossed the green, and opened the back door of the schoolmaster's\ndwelling, which she often did now before bedtime, to assist Sue in\nputting things away.\n\nSue was muddling helplessly in the kitchen, for she was not a good\nhousewife, though she tried to be, and grew impatient of domestic\ndetails.\n\n\"Lord love 'ee, what do ye do that yourself for, when I've come o'\npurpose!  You knew I should come.\"\n\n\"Oh--I don't know--I forgot!  No, I didn't forget.  I did it to\ndiscipline myself.  I have scrubbed the stairs since eight o'clock.\nI MUST practise myself in my household duties.  I've shamefully\nneglected them!\"\n\n\"Why should ye?  He'll get a better school, perhaps be a parson, in\ntime, and you'll keep two servants.  'Tis a pity to spoil them pretty\nhands.\"\n\n\"Don't talk of my pretty hands, Mrs. Edlin.  This pretty body of mine\nhas been the ruin of me already!\"\n\n\"Pshoo--you've got no body to speak of!  You put me more in mind\nof a sperrit.  But there seems something wrong to-night, my dear.\nHusband cross?\"\n\n\"No. He never is.  He's gone to bed early.\"\n\n\"Then what is it?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you.  I have done wrong to-day. And I want to\neradicate it...  Well--I will tell you this--Jude has been here this\nafternoon, and I find I still love him--oh, grossly!  I cannot tell\nyou more.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the widow.  \"I told 'ee how 'twould be!\"\n\n\"But it shan't be!  I have not told my husband of his visit; it is\nnot necessary to trouble him about it, as I never mean to see Jude\nany more.  But I am going to make my conscience right on my duty to\nRichard--by doing a penance--the ultimate thing. I must!\"\n\n\"I wouldn't--since he agrees to it being otherwise, and it has gone\non three months very well as it is.\"\n\n\"Yes--he agrees to my living as I choose; but I feel it is an\nindulgence I ought not to exact from him.  It ought not to have been\naccepted by me.  To reverse it will be terrible--but I must be more\njust to him.  O why was I so unheroic!\"\n\n\"What is it you don't like in him?\" asked Mrs. Edlin curiously.\n\n\"I cannot tell you.  It is something...  I cannot say.  The mournful\nthing is, that nobody would admit it as a reason for feeling as I do;\nso that no excuse is left me.\"\n\n\"Did you ever tell Jude what it was?\"\n\n\"Never.\"\n\n\"I've heard strange tales o' husbands in my time,\" observed the widow\nin a lowered voice.  \"They say that when the saints were upon the\nearth devils used to take husbands' forms o' nights, and get poor\nwomen into all sorts of trouble.  But I don't know why that should\ncome into my head, for it is only a tale...  What a wind and rain it\nis to-night!  Well--don't be in a hurry to alter things, my dear.\nThink it over.\"\n\n\"No, no!  I've screwed my weak soul up to treating him more\ncourteously--and it must be now--at once--before I break down!\"\n\n\"I don't think you ought to force your nature.  No woman ought to be\nexpected to.\"\n\n\"It is my duty.  I will drink my cup to the dregs!\"\n\nHalf an hour later when Mrs. Edlin put on her bonnet and shawl to\nleave, Sue seemed to be seized with vague terror.\n\n\"No--no--don't go, Mrs. Edlin,\" she implored, her eyes enlarged, and\nwith a quick nervous look over her shoulder.\n\n\"But it is bedtime, child.\"\n\n\"Yes, but--there's the little spare room--my room that was.  It is\nquite ready.  Please stay, Mrs. Edlin!--I shall want you in the\nmorning.\"\n\n\"Oh well--I don't mind, if you wish.  Nothing will happen to my four\nold walls, whether I be there or no.\"\n\nShe then fastened up the doors, and they ascended the stairs\ntogether.\n\n\"Wait here, Mrs. Edlin,\" said Sue.  \"I'll go into my old room a\nmoment by myself.\"\n\nLeaving the widow on the landing Sue turned to the chamber which had\nbeen hers exclusively since her arrival at Marygreen, and pushing to\nthe door knelt down by the bed for a minute or two.  She then arose,\nand taking her night-gown from the pillow undressed and came out to\nMrs. Edlin.  A man could be heard snoring in the room opposite.  She\nwished Mrs. Edlin good-night, and the widow entered the room that Sue\nhad just vacated.\n\nSue unlatched the other chamber door, and, as if seized with\nfaintness, sank down outside it.  Getting up again she half opened\nthe door, and said \"Richard.\"  As the word came out of her mouth she\nvisibly shuddered.\n\nThe snoring had quite ceased for some time, but he did not reply.\nSue seemed relieved, and hurried back to Mrs. Edlin's chamber.  \"Are\nyou in bed, Mrs. Edlin?\" she asked.\n\n\"No, dear,\" said the widow, opening the door.  \"I be old and slow,\nand it takes me a long while to un-ray.  I han't unlaced my jumps\nyet.\"\n\n\"I--don't hear him!  And perhaps--perhaps--\"\n\n\"What, child?\"\n\n\"Perhaps he's dead!\" she gasped.  \"And then--I should be FREE, and I\ncould go to Jude! ...  Ah--no--I forgot HER--and God!\"\n\n\"Let's go and hearken.  No--he's snoring again.  But the rain and the\nwind is so loud that you can hardly hear anything but between\nwhiles.\"\n\nSue had dragged herself back.  \"Mrs. Edlin, good-night again!  I am\nsorry I called you out.\"  The widow retreated a second time.\n\nThe strained, resigned look returned to Sue's face when she was\nalone.  \"I must do it--I must!  I must drink to the dregs!\" she\nwhispered. \"Richard!\" she said again.\n\n\"Hey--what?  Is that you, Susanna?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"What do you want?  Anything the matter?  Wait a moment.\"  He pulled\non some articles of clothing, and came to the door.  \"Yes?\"\n\n\"When we were at Shaston I jumped out of the window rather than that\nyou should come near me.  I have never reversed that treatment till\nnow--when I have come to beg your pardon for it, and ask you to let\nme in.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you only think you ought to do this?  I don't wish you to\ncome against your impulses, as I have said.\"\n\n\"But I beg to be admitted.\"  She waited a moment, and repeated,\n\"I beg to be admitted!  I have been in error--even to-day. I have\nexceeded my rights.  I did not mean to tell you, but perhaps I ought.\nI sinned against you this afternoon.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"I met Jude!  I didn't know he was coming.  And--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I kissed him, and let him kiss me.\"\n\n\"Oh--the old story!\"\n\n\"Richard, I didn't know we were going to kiss each other till we\ndid!\"\n\n\"How many times?\"\n\n\"A good many.  I don't know.  I am horrified to look back on it, and\nthe least I can do after it is to come to you like this.\"\n\n\"Come--this is pretty bad, after what I've done!  Anything else to\nconfess?\"\n\n\"No.\"  She had been intending to say: \"I called him my darling Love.\"\nBut, as a contrite woman always keeps back a little, that portion of\nthe scene remained untold.  She went on: \"I am never going to see him\nany more.  He spoke of some things of the past, and it overcame me.\nHe spoke of--the children.  But, as I have said, I am glad--almost\nglad I mean--that they are dead, Richard.  It blots out all that life\nof mine!\"\n\n\"Well--about not seeing him again any more.  Come--you really mean\nthis?\"  There was something in Phillotson's tone now which seemed to\nshow that his three months of remarriage with Sue had somehow not\nbeen so satisfactory as his magnanimity or amative patience had\nanticipated.\n\n\"Yes, yes!\"\n\n\"Perhaps you'll swear it on the New Testament?\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\nHe went back to the room and brought out a little brown Testament.\n\"Now then: So help you God!\"\n\nShe swore.\n\n\"Very good!\"\n\n\"Now I supplicate you, Richard, to whom I belong, and whom I wish to\nhonour and obey, as I vowed, to let me in.\"\n\n\"Think it over well.  You know what it means.  Having you back in the\nhouse was one thing--this another.  So think again.\"\n\n\"I have thought--I wish this!\"\n\n\"That's a complaisant spirit--and perhaps you are right.  With a\nlover hanging about, a half-marriage should be completed.  But I\nrepeat my reminder this third and last time.\"\n\n\"It is my wish! ...  O God!\"\n\n\"What did you say 'O God' for?\"\n\n\"I don't know!\"\n\n\"Yes you do!  But ...\"  He gloomily considered her thin and fragile\nform a moment longer as she crouched before him in her night-clothes.\n\"Well, I thought it might end like this,\" he said presently.  \"I owe\nyou nothing, after these signs; but I'll take you in at your word,\nand forgive you.\"\n\nHe put his arm round her to lift her up.  Sue started back.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" he asked, speaking for the first time sternly.\n\"You shrink from me again?--just as formerly!\"\n\n\"No, Richard--I--I--was not thinking--\"\n\n\"You wish to come in here?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"You still bear in mind what it means?\"\n\n\"Yes.  It is my duty!\"\n\nPlacing the candlestick on the chest of drawers he led her through\nthe doorway, and lifting her bodily, kissed her.  A quick look of\naversion passed over her face, but clenching her teeth she uttered\nno cry.\n\nMrs. Edlin had by this time undressed, and was about to get into bed\nwhen she said to herself: \"Ah--perhaps I'd better go and see if the\nlittle thing is all right.  How it do blow and rain!\"\n\nThe widow went out on the landing, and saw that Sue had disappeared.  \"Ah!\nPoor soul!  Weddings be funerals 'a b'lieve nowadays.  Fifty-five\nyears ago, come Fall, since my man and I married!  Times have changed\nsince then!\"\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nDespite himself Jude recovered somewhat, and worked at his trade for\nseveral weeks.  After Christmas, however, he broke down again.\n\nWith the money he had earned he shifted his lodgings to a yet more\ncentral part of the town.  But Arabella saw that he was not likely\nto do much work for a long while, and was cross enough at the turn\naffairs had taken since her remarriage to him.  \"I'm hanged if you\nhaven't been clever in this last stroke!\" she would say, \"to get a\nnurse for nothing by marrying me!\"\n\nJude was absolutely indifferent to what she said, and indeed, often\nregarded her abuse in a humorous light.  Sometimes his mood was more\nearnest, and as he lay he often rambled on upon the defeat of his\nearly aims.\n\n\"Every man has some little power in some one direction,\" he would\nsay.  \"I was never really stout enough for the stone trade,\nparticularly the fixing.  Moving the blocks always used to strain\nme, and standing the trying draughts in buildings before the windows\nare in always gave me colds, and I think that began the mischief\ninside.  But I felt I could do one thing if I had the opportunity.\nI could accumulate ideas, and impart them to others.  I wonder if the\nfounders had such as I in their minds--a fellow good for nothing else\nbut that particular thing? ...  I hear that soon there is going to\nbe a better chance for such helpless students as I was.  There are\nschemes afoot for making the university less exclusive, and extending\nits influence.  I don't know much about it.  And it is too late, too\nlate for me!  Ah--and for how many worthier ones before me!\"\n\n\"How you keep a-mumbling!\" said Arabella.  \"I should have thought\nyou'd have got over all that craze about books by this time.  And so\nyou would, if you'd had any sense to begin with.  You are as bad now\nas when we were first married.\"\n\nOn one occasion while soliloquizing thus he called her \"Sue\"\nunconsciously.\n\n\"I wish you'd mind who you are talking to!\" said Arabella\nindignantly.  \"Calling a respectable married woman by the name of\nthat--\"  She remembered herself and he did not catch the word.\n\nBut in the course of time, when she saw how things were going, and\nhow very little she had to fear from Sue's rivalry, she had a fit of\ngenerosity.  \"I suppose you want to see your--Sue?\" she said.  \"Well,\nI don't mind her coming.  You can have her here if you like.\"\n\n\"I don't wish to see her again.\"\n\n\"Oh--that's a change!\"\n\n\"And don't tell her anything about me--that I'm ill, or anything.\nShe has chosen her course.  Let her go!\"\n\nOne day he received a surprise.  Mrs. Edlin came to see him, quite\non her own account.  Jude's wife, whose feelings as to where his\naffections were centred had reached absolute indifference by\nthis time, went out, leaving the old woman alone with Jude.  He\nimpulsively asked how Sue was, and then said bluntly, remembering\nwhat Sue had told him: \"I suppose they are still only husband and\nwife in name?\"\n\nMrs. Edlin hesitated.  \"Well, no--it's different now.  She's begun it\nquite lately--all of her own free will.\"\n\n\"When did she begin?\" he asked quickly.\n\n\"The night after you came.  But as a punishment to her poor self.\nHe didn't wish it, but she insisted.\"\n\n\"Sue, my Sue--you darling fool--this is almost more than I can\nendure! ...  Mrs. Edlin--don't be frightened at my rambling--I've\ngot to talk to myself lying here so many hours alone--she was once\na woman whose intellect was to mine like a star to a benzoline lamp:\nwho saw all MY superstitions as cobwebs that she could brush away\nwith a word.  Then bitter affliction came to us, and her intellect\nbroke, and she veered round to darkness.  Strange difference of sex,\nthat time and circumstance, which enlarge the views of most men,\nnarrow the views of women almost invariably.  And now the ultimate\nhorror has come--her giving herself like this to what she loathes, in\nher enslavement to forms!  She, so sensitive, so shrinking, that the\nvery wind seemed to blow on her with a touch of deference...  As for\nSue and me when we were at our own best, long ago--when our minds\nwere clear, and our love of truth fearless--the time was not ripe\nfor us!  Our ideas were fifty years too soon to be any good to us.\nAnd so the resistance they met with brought reaction in her, and\nrecklessness and ruin on me! ...  There--this, Mrs. Edlin, is how\nI go on to myself continually, as I lie here.  I must be boring you\nawfully.\"\n\n\"Not at all, my dear boy.  I could hearken to 'ee all day.\"\n\nAs Jude reflected more and more on her news, and grew more restless,\nhe began in his mental agony to use terribly profane language about\nsocial conventions, which started a fit of coughing.  Presently there\ncame a knock at the door downstairs.  As nobody answered it Mrs.\nEdlin herself went down.\n\nThe visitor said blandly: \"The Doctor.\"  The lanky form was that of\nPhysician Vilbert, who had been called in by Arabella.\n\n\"How is my patient at present?\" asked the physician.\n\n\"Oh bad--very bad!  Poor chap, he got excited, and do blaspeam\nterribly, since I let out some gossip by accident--the more to my\nblame.  But there--you must excuse a man in suffering for what he\nsays, and I hope God will forgive him.\"\n\n\"Ah.  I'll go up and see him.  Mrs. Fawley at home?\"\n\n\"She's not in at present, but she'll be here soon.\"\n\nVilbert went; but though Jude had hitherto taken the medicines of\nthat skilful practitioner with the greatest indifference whenever\npoured down his throat by Arabella, he was now so brought to bay by\nevents that he vented his opinion of Vilbert in the physician's face,\nand so forcibly, and with such striking epithets, that Vilbert soon\nscurried downstairs again.  At the door he met Arabella, Mrs. Edlin\nhaving left.  Arabella inquired how he thought her husband was\nnow, and seeing that the Doctor looked ruffled, asked him to take\nsomething.  He assented.\n\n\"I'll bring it to you here in the passage,\" she said.  \"There's\nnobody but me about the house to-day.\"\n\nShe brought him a bottle and a glass, and he drank.\n\nArabella began shaking with suppressed laughter.  \"What is this, my\ndear?\" he asked, smacking his lips.\n\n\"Oh--a drop of wine--and something in it.\"  Laughing again she said:\n\"I poured your own love-philtre into it, that you sold me at the\nagricultural show, don't you re-member?\"\n\n\"I do, I do!  Clever woman!  But you must be prepared for the\nconsequences.\"  Putting his arm round her shoulders he kissed her\nthere and then.\n\n\"Don't don't,\" she whispered, laughing good-humouredly. \"My man will\nhear.\"\n\nShe let him out of the house, and as she went back she said to\nherself: \"Well!  Weak women must provide for a rainy day.  And if my\npoor fellow upstairs do go off--as I suppose he will soon--it's well\nto keep chances open.  And I can't pick and choose now as I could\nwhen I was younger.  And one must take the old if one can't get the\nyoung.\"\n\n\n\nXI\n\n\nThe last pages to which the chronicler of these lives would ask the\nreader's attention are concerned with the scene in and out of Jude's\nbedroom when leafy summer came round again.\n\nHis face was now so thin that his old friends would hardly have known\nhim.  It was afternoon, and Arabella was at the looking-glass curling\nher hair, which operation she performed by heating an umbrella-stay\nin the flame of a candle she had lighted, and using it upon the\nflowing lock.  When she had finished this, practised a dimple, and\nput on her things, she cast her eyes round upon Jude.  He seemed to\nbe sleeping, though his position was an elevated one, his malady\npreventing him lying down.\n\nArabella, hatted, gloved, and ready, sat down and waited, as if\nexpecting some one to come and take her place as nurse.\n\nCertain sounds from without revealed that the town was in festivity,\nthough little of the festival, whatever it might have been, could be\nseen here.  Bells began to ring, and the notes came into the room\nthrough the open window, and travelled round Jude's head in a hum.\nThey made her restless, and at last she said to herself: \"Why ever\ndoesn't Father come?\"\n\nShe looked again at Jude, critically gauged his ebbing life, as she\nhad done so many times during the late months, and glancing at his\nwatch, which was hung up by way of timepiece, rose impatiently.\nStill he slept, and coming to a resolution she slipped from the room,\nclosed the door noiselessly, and descended the stairs.  The house\nwas empty.  The attraction which moved Arabella to go abroad had\nevidently drawn away the other inmates long before.\n\nIt was a warm, cloudless, enticing day.  She shut the front door, and\nhastened round into Chief Street, and when near the theatre could\nhear the notes of the organ, a rehearsal for a coming concert being\nin progress.  She entered under the archway of Oldgate College, where\nmen were putting up awnings round the quadrangle for a ball in the\nhall that evening.  People who had come up from the country for the\nday were picnicking on the grass, and Arabella walked along the\ngravel paths and under the aged limes.  But finding this place rather\ndull she returned to the streets, and watched the carriages drawing\nup for the concert, numerous Dons and their wives, and undergraduates\nwith gay female companions, crowding up likewise.  When the doors\nwere closed, and the concert began, she moved on.\n\nThe powerful notes of that concert rolled forth through the swinging\nyellow blinds of the open windows, over the housetops, and into the\nstill air of the lanes.  They reached so far as to the room in which\nJude lay; and it was about this time that his cough began again and\nawakened him.\n\nAs soon as he could speak he murmured, his eyes still closed: \"A\nlittle water, please.\"\n\nNothing but the deserted room received his appeal, and he coughed\nto exhaustion again--saying still more feebly: \"Water--some\nwater--Sue--Arabella!\"\n\nThe room remained still as before.  Presently he gasped again:\n\"Throat--water--Sue--darling--drop of water--please--oh please!\"\n\nNo water came, and the organ notes, faint as a bee's hum, rolled in\nas before.\n\nWhile he remained, his face changing, shouts and hurrahs came from\nsomewhere in the direction of the river.\n\n\"Ah--yes!  The Remembrance games,\" he murmured.  \"And I here.  And\nSue defiled!\"\n\nThe hurrahs were repeated, drowning the faint organ notes.  Jude's\nface changed more: he whispered slowly, his parched lips scarcely\nmoving:\n\n_\"Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it\nwas said, There is a man-child conceived.\"_\n\n(\"Hurrah!\")\n\n_\"Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither\nlet the light shine upon it.  Lo, let that night be solitary, let no\njoyful voice come therein.\"_\n\n(\"Hurrah!\")\n\n_\"Why died I not from the womb?  Why did I not give up the ghost when\nI came out of the belly? ...  For now should I have lain still and\nbeen quiet.  I should have slept: then had I been at rest!\"_\n\n(\"Hurrah!\")\n\n_\"There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the\noppressor...  The small and the great are there; and the servant is\nfree from his master.  Wherefore is light given to him that is in\nmisery, and life unto the bitter in soul?\"_\n\n\n\nMeanwhile Arabella, in her journey to discover what was going on,\ntook a short cut down a narrow street and through an obscure nook\ninto the quad of Cardinal.  It was full of bustle, and brilliant\nin the sunlight with flowers and other preparations for a ball\nhere also.  A carpenter nodded to her, one who had formerly been a\nfellow-workman of Jude's.  A corridor was in course of erection from\nthe entrance to the hall staircase, of gay red and buff bunting.\nWaggon-loads of boxes containing bright plants in full bloom were\nbeing placed about, and the great staircase was covered with red\ncloth.  She nodded to one workman and another, and ascended to the\nhall on the strength of their acquaintance, where they were putting\ndown a new floor and decorating for the dance.\n\nThe cathedral bell close at hand was sounding for five o'clock\nservice.\n\n\"I should not mind having a spin there with a fellow's arm round my\nwaist,\" she said to one of the men.  \"But Lord, I must be getting\nhome again--there's a lot to do.  No dancing for me!\"\n\nWhen she reached home she was met at the door by Stagg, and one or\ntwo other of Jude's fellow stoneworkers.  \"We are just going down\nto the river,\" said the former, \"to see the boat-bumping.  But we've\ncalled round on our way to ask how your husband is.\"\n\n\"He's sleeping nicely, thank you,\" said Arabella.\n\n\"That's right.  Well now, can't you give yourself half an hour's\nrelaxation, Mrs. Fawley, and come along with us?  'Twould do you\ngood.\"\n\n\"I should like to go,\" said she.  \"I've never seen the boat-racing,\nand I hear it is good fun.\"\n\n\"Come along!\"\n\n\"How I WISH I could!\"  She looked longingly down the street.  \"Wait\na minute, then.  I'll just run up and see how he is now.  Father is\nwith him, I believe; so I can most likely come.\"\n\nThey waited, and she entered.  Downstairs the inmates were absent\nas before, having, in fact, gone in a body to the river where the\nprocession of boats was to pass.  When she reached the bedroom she\nfound that her father had not even now come.\n\n\"Why couldn't he have been here!\" she said impatiently.  \"He wants to\nsee the boats himself--that's what it is!\"\n\nHowever, on looking round to the bed she brightened, for she saw\nthat Jude was apparently sleeping, though he was not in the usual\nhalf-elevated posture necessitated by his cough.  He had slipped\ndown, and lay flat.  A second glance caused her to start, and she\nwent to the bed.  His face was quite white, and gradually becoming\nrigid.  She touched his fingers; they were cold, though his body was\nstill warm.  She listened at his chest.  All was still within.  The\nbumping of near thirty years had ceased.\n\nAfter her first appalled sense of what had happened, the faint notes\nof a military or other brass band from the river reached her ears;\nand in a provoked tone she exclaimed, \"To think he should die just\nnow!  Why did he die just now!\"  Then meditating another moment or\ntwo she went to the door, softly closed it as before, and again\ndescended the stairs.\n\n\"Here she is!\" said one of the workmen.  \"We wondered if you were\ncoming after all.  Come along; we must be quick to get a good\nplace...  Well, how is he?  Sleeping well still?  Of course, we don't\nwant to drag 'ee away if--\"\n\n\"Oh yes--sleeping quite sound.  He won't wake yet,\" she said\nhurriedly.\n\nThey went with the crowd down Cardinal Street, where they presently\nreached the bridge, and the gay barges burst upon their view.  Thence\nthey passed by a narrow slit down to the riverside path--now dusty,\nhot, and thronged.  Almost as soon as they had arrived the grand\nprocession of boats began; the oars smacking with a loud kiss on the\nface of the stream, as they were lowered from the perpendicular.\n\n\"Oh, I say--how jolly!  I'm glad I've come,\" said Arabella.  \"And--it\ncan't hurt my husband--my being away.\"\n\nOn the opposite side of the river, on the crowded barges, were\ngorgeous nosegays of feminine beauty, fashionably arrayed in green,\npink, blue, and white.  The blue flag of the boat club denoted the\ncentre of interest, beneath which a band in red uniform gave out the\nnotes she had already heard in the death-chamber.  Collegians of all\nsorts, in canoes with ladies, watching keenly for \"our\" boat, darted\nup and down.  While she regarded the lively scene somebody touched\nArabella in the ribs, and looking round she saw Vilbert.\n\n\"That philtre is operating, you know!\" he said with a leer.  \"Shame\non 'ee to wreck a heart so!\"\n\n\"I shan't talk of love to-day.\"\n\n\"Why not?  It is a general holiday.\"\n\nShe did not reply.  Vilbert's arm stole round her waist, which act\ncould be performed unobserved in the crowd.  An arch expression\noverspread Arabella's face at the feel of the arm, but she kept her\neyes on the river as if she did not know of the embrace.\n\nThe crowd surged, pushing Arabella and her friends sometimes nearly\ninto the river, and she would have laughed heartily at the horse-play\nthat succeeded, if the imprint on her mind's eye of a pale,\nstatuesque countenance she had lately gazed upon had not sobered her\na little.\n\nThe fun on the water reached the acme of excitement; there were\nimmersions, there were shouts: the race was lost and won, the pink\nand blue and yellow ladies retired from the barges, and the people\nwho had watched began to move.\n\n\"Well--it's been awfully good,\" cried Arabella.  \"But I think I must\nget back to my poor man.  Father is there, so far as I know; but I\nhad better get back.\"\n\n\"What's your hurry?\"\n\n\"Well, I must go...  Dear, dear, this is awkward!\"\n\nAt the narrow gangway where the people ascended from the riverside\npath to the bridge the crowd was literally jammed into one hot\nmass--Arabella and Vilbert with the rest; and here they remained\nmotionless, Arabella exclaiming, \"Dear, dear!\" more and more\nimpatiently; for it had just occurred to her mind that if Jude were\ndiscovered to have died alone an inquest might be deemed necessary.\n\n\"What a fidget you are, my love,\" said the physician, who, being\npressed close against her by the throng, had no need of personal\neffort for contact.  \"Just as well have patience: there's no getting\naway yet!\"\n\nIt was nearly ten minutes before the wedged multitude moved\nsufficiently to let them pass through.  As soon as she got up\ninto the street Arabella hastened on, forbidding the physician to\naccompany her further that day.  She did not go straight to her\nhouse; but to the abode of a woman who performed the last necessary\noffices for the poorer dead; where she knocked.\n\n\"My husband has just gone, poor soul,\" she said.  \"Can you come and\nlay him out?\"\n\nArabella waited a few minutes; and the two women went along, elbowing\ntheir way through the stream of fashionable people pouring out of\nCardinal meadow, and being nearly knocked down by the carriages.\n\n\"I must call at the sexton's about the bell, too,\" said Arabella.\n\"It is just round here, isn't it?  I'll meet you at my door.\"\n\nBy ten o'clock that night Jude was lying on the bedstead at his\nlodging covered with a sheet, and straight as an arrow.  Through the\npartly opened window the joyous throb of a waltz entered from the\nball-room at Cardinal.\n\n\n\nTwo days later, when the sky was equally cloudless, and the air\nequally still, two persons stood beside Jude's open coffin in the\nsame little bedroom.  On one side was Arabella, on the other the\nWidow Edlin.  They were both looking at Jude's face, the worn old\neyelids of Mrs. Edlin being red.\n\n\"How beautiful he is!\" said she.\n\n\"Yes.  He's a 'andsome corpse,\" said Arabella.\n\nThe window was still open to ventilate the room, and it being about\nnoontide the clear air was motionless and quiet without.  From a\ndistance came voices; and an apparent noise of persons stamping.\n\n\"What's that?\" murmured the old woman.\n\n\"Oh, that's the Doctors in the theatre, conferring Honorary degrees\non the Duke of Hamptonshire and a lot more illustrious gents of that\nsort.  It's Remembrance Week, you know.  The cheers come from the\nyoung men.\"\n\n\"Aye; young and strong-lunged!  Not like our poor boy here.\"\n\nAn occasional word, as from some one making a speech, floated from\nthe open windows of the theatre across to this quiet corner, at which\nthere seemed to be a smile of some sort upon the marble features\nof Jude; while the old, superseded, Delphin editions of Virgil and\nHorace, and the dog-eared Greek Testament on the neighbouring shelf,\nand the few other volumes of the sort that he had not parted with,\nroughened with stone-dust where he had been in the habit of catching\nthem up for a few minutes between his labours, seemed to pale to a\nsickly cast at the sounds.  The bells struck out joyously; and their\nreverberations travelled round the bed-room.\n\nArabella's eyes removed from Jude to Mrs. Edlin.  \"D'ye think she\nwill come?\" she asked.\n\n\"I could not say.  She swore not to see him again.\"\n\n\"How is she looking?\"\n\n\"Tired and miserable, poor heart.  Years and years older than when\nyou saw her last.  Quite a staid, worn woman now.  'Tis the man--she\ncan't stomach un, even now!\"\n\n\"If Jude had been alive to see her, he would hardly have cared for\nher any more, perhaps.\"\n\n\"That's what we don't know...  Didn't he ever ask you to send for\nher, since he came to see her in that strange way?\"\n\n\"No.  Quite the contrary.  I offered to send, and he said I was not\nto let her know how ill he was.\"\n\n\"Did he forgive her?\"\n\n\"Not as I know.\"\n\n\"Well--poor little thing, 'tis to be believed she's found forgiveness\nsomewhere!  She said she had found peace!\n\n\"She may swear that on her knees to the holy cross upon her necklace\ntill she's hoarse, but it won't be true!\" said Arabella.  \"She's\nnever found peace since she left his arms, and never will again till\nshe's as he is now!\"\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK JUDE THE OBSCURE***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 153-8.txt or 153-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/1\/5\/153\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":479,"split":"train"}
