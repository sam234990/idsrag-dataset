{"ori_id":"6f1e8b48580a3f57556ea3fcb129bb0024cf1567","title":"Ralph the Heir","context":"Ralph the Heir\n The title character is Ralph Newton, the nephew of Squire Gregory Newton of Newton Priory. The squire has never married; he has an illegitimate son, also named Ralph Newton, whom he loves dearly. However, the estate is entailed, and after his death will go to his nephew Ralph; he cannot leave it to his natural son.\nRalph the heir is a spendthrift, and has run himself deep into debt. There are two ways in which he can extricate himself: by raising money on his future interest in the Newton estate, or by marrying Polly Neefit, the daughter of a wealthy breeches-maker who is one of his major creditors. Neither choice is a good one for him: the first might lead to the estate's being seized by his creditors upon the old squire's death; the second would mean allying himself to a family of a much lower social class, thus putting his own social standing at risk.\nThe squire, anxious to obtain full possession of the estate so that he can pass it to his son, offers to buy the heir's reversion. Ralph vacillates, hesitatingly proposes to and is rejected twice by Polly Neefit, and eventually accepts his uncle's offer. However, before the transaction can be completed, the squire is killed in a hunting accident and his nephew comes into full possession of the property and its large income.\nNow safe from his creditors, the new squire is nevertheless harassed by Polly Neefit's father, who threatens him with legal action and embarrassing publicity if he does not continue seeking his daughter's hand. The matter is eventually resolved by Polly, who accepts the oft-repeated proposals of Ontario Moggs, son of a prosperous bootmaker, and induces her father to consent to the marriage despite his preference for the squire. In the meantime, Ralph the squire has proposed to and been rejected by Mary Bonner, the beautiful niece and ward of Sir Thomas Underwood; soon after this, she accepts an offer of marriage from the illegitimate Ralph.\nThe novel also describes a Parliamentary election in the fictional borough of Percycross, in which Sir Thomas, a Conservative, and Moggs, a Radical, are two of the four candidates for the two available seats. Both are eager that the election be conducted fairly and honestly. The other two candidates, one a Conservative and one a Liberal, are the incumbents; they see nothing wrong with the buying and selling of votes that has been traditional at Percycross. Sir Thomas and his fellow Conservative win the election, but it is annulled on petition, and the borough is disfranchised by Parliament because of its pervasive corruption.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, Ralph the Heir, by Anthony Trollope,\nIllustrated by F.

CONCLUSION.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nSIR THOMAS.\n\n\nThere are men who cannot communicate themselves to others, as there\nare also men who not only can do so, but cannot do otherwise. And\nit is hard to say which is the better man of the two. We do not\nspecially respect him who wears his heart upon his sleeve for daws to\npeck at, who carries a crystal window to his bosom so that all can\nsee the work that is going on within it, who cannot keep any affair\nof his own private, who gushes out in love and friendship to every\nchance acquaintance; but then, again, there is but little love given\nto him who is always wary, always silent as to his own belongings,\nwho buttons himself in a suit of close reserve which he never\nloosens. Respect such a one may gain, but hardly love. It is natural\nto us to like to know the affairs of our friends; and natural also,\nI think, to like to talk of our own to those whom we trust. Perhaps,\nafter all that may be said of the weakness of the gushing and\nindiscreet babbler, it is pleasanter to live with such a one than\nwith the self-constrained reticent man of iron, whose conversation\namong his most intimate friends is solely of politics, of science, of\nliterature, or of some other subject equally outside the privacies of\nour inner life.\n\nSir Thomas Underwood, whom I, and I hope my readers also, will have\nto know very intimately, was one of those who are not able to make\nthemselves known intimately to any. I am speaking now of a man of\nsixty, and I am speaking also of one who had never yet made a close\nfriend,--who had never by unconscious and slow degrees of affection\nfallen into that kind of intimacy with another man which justifies\nand renders necessary mutual freedom of intercourse in all the\naffairs of life. And yet he was possessed of warm affections, was by\nno means misanthropic in his nature, and would, in truth, have given\nmuch to be able to be free and jocund as are other men. He lacked\nthe power that way, rather than the will. To himself it seemed to be\na weakness in him rather than a strength that he should always be\nsilent, always guarded, always secret and dark. He had lamented it\nas an acknowledged infirmity;--as a man grieves that he should be\nshort-sighted, or dull of hearing; but at the age of sixty he had\ntaken no efficient steps towards curing himself of the evil, and had\nnow abandoned all idea of any such cure.\n\nWhether he had been, upon the whole, fortunate or unfortunate in life\nshall be left to the reader's judgment. But he certainly had not been\nhappy. He had suffered cruel disappointments; and a disappointment\nwill crush the spirit worse than a realised calamity. There is no\nactual misfortune in not being Lord Mayor of London;--but when a man\nhas set his heart upon the place, has worked himself into a position\nwithin a few feet of the Mansion House, has become alderman with\nthe mayoralty before him in immediate rotation, he will suffer more\nat being passed over by the liverymen than if he had lost half his\nfortune. Now Sir Thomas Underwood had become Solicitor-General in his\nprofession, but had never risen to the higher rank or more assured\nemoluments of other legal offices.\n\nWe will not quite trace our Meleager back to his egg, but we will\nexplain that he was the only son of a barrister of moderate means,\nwho put him to the Bar, and who died leaving little or nothing behind\nhim. The young barrister had an only sister, who married an officer\nin the army, and who had passed all her latter life in distant\ncountries to which her husband had been called by the necessity of\nliving on the income which his profession gave him. As a Chancery\nbarrister, Mr. Underwood,--our Sir Thomas,--had done well, living on\nthe income he made, marrying at thirty-five, going into Parliament\nat forty-five, becoming Solicitor-General at fifty,--and ceasing\nto hold that much-desired office four months after his appointment.\nSuch cessation, however, arising from political causes, is no\ndisappointment to a man. It will doubtless be the case that a man so\nplaced will regret the weakness of his party, which has been unable\nto keep the good things of Government in its hands; but he will\nrecognise without remorse or sorrow the fact that the Ministry to\nwhich he has attached himself must cease to be a Ministry;--and there\nwill be nothing in his displacement to gall his pride, or to create\nthat inner feeling of almost insupportable mortification which comes\nfrom the conviction of personal failure. Sir Thomas Underwood had\nbeen Solicitor-General for a few months under a Conservative Prime\nMinister; and when the Conservative Minister went out of office, Sir\nThomas Underwood followed him with no feeling of regret that caused\nhim unhappiness. But when afterwards the same party came back to\npower, and he, having lost his election at the borough which he had\nrepresented, was passed over without a word of sympathy or even of\nassumed regret from the Minister, then he was wounded. It was true,\nhe knew, that a man, to be Solicitor-General, should have a seat\nin Parliament. The highest legal offices in the country are not to\nbe attained by any amount of professional excellence, unless the\ncandidate shall have added to such excellence the power of supporting\na Ministry and a party in the House of Commons. Sir Thomas Underwood\nthoroughly understood this;--but he knew also that there are various\nways in which a lame dog may be helped over a stile,--if only the\nlame dog be popular among dogs. For another ex-Solicitor-General\na seat would have been found,--or some delay would have been\ngranted,--or at least there would have been a consultation, with a\nsuggestion that something should be tried. But in this case a man\nfour years his junior in age, whom he despised, and who, as he was\ninformed, had obtained his place in Parliament by gross bribery, was\nput into the office without a word of apology to him. Then he was\nunhappy, and acknowledged to himself that his spirit was crushed.\n\nBut he acknowledged to himself at the same time that he was one\ndoomed by his nature to such crushing of the spirit if he came out of\nthe hole of his solitude, and endeavoured to carry on the open fight\nof life among his fellow-men. He knew that he was one doomed to\nthat disappointment, the bitterest of all, which comes from failure\nwhen the prize has been all but reached. It is much to have become\nSolicitor-General, and that he had achieved;--but it is worse than\nnothing to have been Solicitor-General for four months, and then\nto find that all the world around one regards one as having failed,\nand as being, therefore, fit for the shelf. Such were Sir Thomas\nUnderwood's feelings as he sat alone in his chambers during those\ndays in which the new administration was formed,--in which days he\nwas neither consulted nor visited, nor communicated with either by\nmessage or by letter. But all this,--this formation of a Ministry,\nin which the late Solicitor-General was not invited to take a\npart,--occurred seven years before the commencement of our story.\n\nDuring those years in which our lawyer sat in Parliament as Mr.\nUnderwood,--at which time he was working hard also as a Chancery\nbarrister, and was, perhaps, nearer to his fellow-men than he had\never been before, or was ever destined to be afterwards,--he resided,\nas regarded himself almost nominally, at a small but pretty villa,\nwhich he had taken for his wife's sake at Fulham. It was close upon\nthe river, and had well-arranged, though not extensive, shrubbery\nwalks, and a little lawn, and a tiny conservatory, and a charming\nopening down to the Thames. Mrs. Underwood had found herself unable\nto live in Half-moon Street; and Mr. Underwood, not unwillingly,\nhad removed his household gods to this retreat. At that time his\nhousehold gods consisted of a wife and two daughters;--but the wife\nhad died before the time came at which she could have taken on\nherself the name of Lady Underwood. The villa at Fulham was still\nkept, and there lived the two girls, and there also Sir Thomas, had\nhe been interrogated on the subject, would have declared that he also\nwas domiciled. But if a man lives at the place in which he most often\nsleeps, Sir Thomas in truth lived at his chambers at Southampton\nBuildings. When he moved those household gods of his to the villa, it\nwas necessary, because of his duties in Parliament, that he should\nhave some place in town wherein he might lay his head, and therefore,\nI fear not unwillingly, he took to laying his head very frequently in\nthe little bedroom which was attached to his chambers.\n\nIt is not necessary that we should go back to any feelings which\nmight have operated upon him during his wife's lifetime, or during\nthe period of his parliamentary career. His wife was now dead, and\nhe no longer held a seat in Parliament. He had, indeed, all but\nabandoned his practice at the Bar, never putting himself forward for\nthe ordinary business of a Chancery barrister. But, nevertheless,\nhe spent the largest half of his life in his chambers, breakfasting\nthere, reading there, writing there, and sleeping there. He did not\naltogether desert the lodge at Fulham, and the two girls who lived\nthere. He would not even admit to them, or allow them to assert that\nhe had not his home with them. Sometimes for two nights together,\nand sometimes for three, he would be at the villa,--never remaining\nthere, however, during the day. But on Sundays it may almost be said\nthat he was never at home. And hence arose the feeling that of all,\nthis went the nearest to create discord between the father and the\ndaughters. Sir Thomas was always in Southampton Buildings on Sundays.\nDid Sir Thomas go to church? The Miss Underwoods did go to church\nvery regularly, and thought much of the propriety and necessity of\nsuch Sunday exercises. They could remember that in their younger days\ntheir father always had been there with them. They could remember,\nindeed, that he, with something of sternness, would require from them\npunctuality and exactness in this duty. Now and again,--perhaps four\ntimes in the year,--he would go to the Rolls Chapel. So much they\ncould learn, But they believed that beyond that his Sundays were kept\nholy by no attendance at divine service. And it may be said at once\nthat they believed aright.\n\nSir Thomas's chambers in Southampton Buildings, though they were dull\nand dingy of aspect from the outside, and were reached by a staircase\nwhich may be designated as lugubrious,--so much did its dark and\ndismantled condition tend to melancholy,--were in themselves large\nand commodious. His bedroom was small, but he had two spacious\nsitting-rooms, one of which was fitted up as a library, and the\nother as a dining-room. Over and beyond these there was a clerk's\nroom;--for Sir Thomas, though he had given up the greater part of\nhis business, had not given up his clerk; and here the old man, the\nclerk, passed his entire time, from half-past eight in the morning\ntill ten at night, waiting upon his employer in various capacities\nwith a sedulous personal attention to which he had probably not\nintended to devote himself when he first took upon himself the duties\nof clerk to a practising Chancery barrister. But Joseph Stemm and Sir\nThomas were not unlike in character, and had grown old together with\ntoo equal a step to admit of separation and of new alliance. Stemm\nhad but one friend in the world, and Sir Thomas was that friend. I\nhave already said that Sir Thomas had no friend;--but perhaps he felt\nmore of that true intimacy, which friendship produces, with Stemm\nthan with any other human being.\n\nSir Thomas was a tall thin man, who stooped considerably,--though not\nfrom any effect of years, with a face which would perhaps have been\nalmost mean had it not been rescued from that evil condition by the\nassurance of intelligence and strength which is always conveyed by\na certain class of ugliness. He had a nose something like the great\nLord Brougham's,--thin, long, and projecting at the point. He had\nquick grey eyes, and a good forehead;--but the component parts of his\ncountenance were irregular and roughly put together. His chin was\nlong, as was also his upper lip;--so that it may be taken as a fact\nthat he was an ugly man. He was hale, however, and strong, and was\nstill so good a walker that he thought nothing of making his way down\nto the villa on foot of an evening, after dining at his club.\n\nIt was his custom to dine at his club,--that highly respectable and\nmost comfortable club situated at the corner of Suffolk Street, Pall\nMall;--the senior of the two which are devoted to the well-being of\nscions of our great Universities. There Sir Thomas dined, perhaps\nfour nights in the week, for ten months in the year. And it was said\nof him in the club that he had never been known to dine in company\nwith another member of the club. His very manner as he sat at his\nsolitary meal,--always with a pint of port on the table,--was as\nwell known as the figure of the old king on horseback outside in\nthe street, and was as unlike the ordinary manner of men as is that\nunlike the ordinary figures of kings. He had always a book in his\nhand,--not a club book, nor a novel from Mudie's, nor a magazine, but\nsome ancient and hard-bound volume from his own library, which he had\nbrought in his pocket, and to which his undivided attention would be\ngiven. The eating of his dinner, which always consisted of the joint\nof the day and of nothing else, did not take him more than five\nminutes;--but he would sip his port wine slowly, would have a cup of\ntea which he would also drink very slowly,--and would then pocket\nhis book, pay his bill, and would go. It was rarely the case that\nhe spoke to any one in the club. He would bow to a man here and\nthere,--and if addressed would answer; but of conversation at his\nclub he knew nothing, and hardly ever went into any room but that in\nwhich his dinner was served to him.\n\nIn conversing about him men would express a wonder how such a one had\never risen to high office,--how, indeed, he could have thriven at his\nprofession. But in such matters we are, all of us, too apt to form\nconfident opinions on apparent causes which are near the surface, but\nwhich, as guides to character, are fallacious. Perhaps in all London\nthere was no better lawyer, in his branch of law, than Sir Thomas\nUnderwood. He had worked with great diligence; and though he was shy\nto a degree quite unintelligible to men in general in the ordinary\nintercourse of life, he had no feeling of diffidence when upon his\nlegs in Court or in the House of Commons. With the Lord Chancellor's\nwife or daughters he could not exchange five words with comfort to\nhimself,--nor with his lordship himself in a drawing-room; but in\nCourt the Lord Chancellor was no more to him than another lawyer whom\nhe believed to be not so good a lawyer as himself. No man had ever\nsucceeded in browbeating him when panoplied in his wig and gown;\nnor had words ever been wanting to him when so arrayed. It had been\nsuggested to him by an attorney who knew him in that way in which\nattorneys ought to know barristers, that he should stand for a\ncertain borough;--and he had stood and had been returned. Thrice\nhe had been returned for the same town; but at last, when it was\ndiscovered that he would never dine with the leading townsmen,\nor call on their wives in London, or assist them in their little\nprivate views, the strength of his extreme respectability was broken\ndown,--and he was rejected. In the meantime he was found to be\nof value by the party to which he had attached himself. It was\ndiscovered that he was not only a sound lawyer, but a man of great\nerudition, who had studied the experience of history as well\nas the wants of the present age. He was one who would disgrace\nno Government,--and he was invited to accept the office of\nSolicitor-General by a Minister who had never seen him out of the\nHouse of Commons. \"He is as good a lawyer as there is in England,\"\nsaid the Lord Chancellor. \"He always speaks with uncommon clearness,\"\nsaid the Chancellor of the Exchequer. \"I never saw him talking with\na human being,\" said the Secretary to the Treasury, deprecating\nthe appointment. \"He will soon get over that complaint with your\nassistance,\" said the Minister, laughing. So Mr. Underwood became\nSolicitor-General and Sir Thomas;--and he so did his work that no\ndoubt he would have returned to his office had he been in Parliament\nwhen his party returned to power. But he had made no friend, he had\nnot learned to talk even to the Secretary of the Treasury;--and when\nthe party came back to power he was passed over without remorse, and\nalmost without a regret.\n\nHe never resumed the active bustle of his profession after that\ndisappointment. His wife was then dead, and for nearly a twelvemonth\nhe went about, declaring to attorneys and others that his\nprofessional life was done. He did take again to a certain class of\nwork when he came back to the old chambers in Southampton Buildings;\nbut he was seen in Court only rarely, and it was understood that he\nwished it to be supposed that he had retired. He had ever been a\nmoderate man in his mode of living, and had put together a sum of\nmoney sufficient for moderate wants. He possessed some twelve or\nfourteen hundred a year independent of anything that he might now\nearn; and, as he had never been a man greedy of money, so was he now\nmore indifferent to it than in his earlier days. It is a mistake,\nI think, to suppose that men become greedy as they grow old. The\navaricious man will show his avarice as he gets into years, because\navarice is a passion compatible with old age,--and will become more\navaricious as his other passions fall off from him. And so will it\nbe with the man that is open-handed. Mr. Underwood, when struggling\nat the Bar, had fought as hard as any of his compeers for comfort\nand independence;--but money, as money, had never been dear to\nhim;--and now he was so trained a philosopher that he disregarded\nit altogether, except so far as it enabled him to maintain his\nindependence.\n\nOn a certain Friday evening in June, as he sat at dinner at his club,\ninstead of applying himself to his book, which according to his\ncustom he had taken from his pocket, he there read a letter, which\nas soon as read he would restore to the envelope, and would take it\nout again after a few moments of thought. At last, when the cup of\ntea was done and the bill was paid, he put away letter and book\ntogether and walked to the door of his club. When there he stood and\nconsidered what next should he do that evening. It was now past eight\no'clock, and how should he use the four, five, or perhaps six hours\nwhich remained to him before he should go to bed? The temptation\nto which he was liable prompted him to return to his solitude in\nSouthampton Buildings. Should he do so, he would sleep till ten\nin his chair,--then he would read, and drink more tea, or perhaps\nwrite, till one; and after that he would prowl about the purlieus of\nChancery Lane, the Temple, and Lincoln's Inn, till two or even three\no'clock in the morning;--looking up at the old dingy windows, and\nholding, by aid of those powers which imagination gave him, long\nintercourse with men among whom a certain weakness in his physical\norganisation did not enable him to live in the flesh. Well the\npolicemen knew him as he roamed about, and much they speculated as to\nhis roamings. But in these night wanderings he addressed no word to\nany one; nor did any one ever address a word to him. Yet the world,\nperhaps, was more alive to him then than at any other period in the\ntwenty-four hours.\n\nBut on the present occasion the temptation was resisted. He had not\nbeen at home during the whole week, and knew well that he ought to\ngive his daughters the countenance of his presence. Whether that\nfeeling alone would have been sufficient to withdraw him from the\ncharms of Chancery Lane and send him down to the villa may be\ndoubted; but there was that in the letter which he had perused so\ncarefully which he knew must be communicated to his girls. His niece,\nMary Bonner, was now an orphan, and would arrive in England from\nJamaica in about a fortnight. Her mother had been Sir Thomas's\nsister, and had been at this time dead about three years. General\nBonner, the father, had now died, and the girl was left an orphan,\nalmost penniless, and with no near friend unless the Underwoods would\nbefriend her. News of the General's death had reached Sir Thomas\nbefore;--and he had already made inquiry as to the fate of his niece\nthrough her late father's agents. Of the General's means he had known\nabsolutely nothing,--believing, however, that they were confined to\nhis pay as an officer. Now he was told that the girl would be at\nSouthampton in a fortnight, and that she was utterly destitute. He\ndeclared to himself as he stood on the steps of the club that he\nwould go home and consult his daughters;--but his mind was in fact\nmade up as to his niece's fate long before he got home,--before he\nturned out of Pall Mall into St. James's Park. He would sometimes\ntalk to himself of consulting his daughters; but in truth he very\nrarely consulted any human being as to what he would do or leave\nundone. If he went straight, he went straight without other human\nlight than such as was given to him by his own intellect, his own\nheart, and his own conscience. It took him about an hour and a half\nto reach his home, but of that time four-fifths were occupied, not in\nresolving what he would do in this emergency, but in deep grumblings\nand regrets that there should be such a thing to be done at all. All\nnew cares were grievous to him. Nay;--old cares were grievous, but\nnew cares were terrible. Though he was bold in deciding, he was very\ntimid in looking forward as to the results of that decision. Of\ncourse the orphan girl must be taken into his house;--and of course\nhe must take upon himself the duty of a father in regard to her.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nPOPHAM VILLA.\n\n\nPopham Villa was the name of the house at Fulham,--as was to be seen\nby all men passing by, for it was painted up conspicuously on the\npillars through which the gate led into the garden. Mr. Underwood,\nwhen he had first taken the place, had wished to expunge the name,\nfeeling it to be cockneyfied, pretentious, and unalluring. But Mrs.\nUnderwood had rather liked it, and it remained. It was a subject of\nridicule with the two girls; but they had never ventured to urge\nits withdrawal, and after his wife's death Sir Thomas never alluded\nto the subject. Popham Villa it was, therefore, and there the\nwords remained. The house was unpretentious, containing only two\nsitting-rooms besides a small side closet,--for it could hardly be\ncalled more,--which the girls even in their mother's lifetime had\nclaimed as their own. But the drawing-room was as pretty as room\ncould be, opening on to the lawn with folding windows, and giving a\nnear view of the bright river as it flowed by, with just a glimpse\nof the bridge. That and the dining-room and the little closet were\nall on the ground floor, and above were at any rate as many chambers\nas the family required. The girls desired no better house,--if only\ntheir father could be with them. But he would urge that his books\nwere all in London; and that, even were he willing to move them,\nthere was no room for them in Popham Villa.\n\nIt was sad enough for the two girls,--this kind of life. The worst\nof it, perhaps, was this; that they never knew when to expect him. A\nword had been said once as to the impracticability of having dinner\nready for a gentleman, when the gentleman would never say whether\nhe would want a dinner. It had been an unfortunate remark, for Sir\nThomas had taken advantage of it by saying that when he came he\nwould come after dinner, unless he had certified to the contrary\nbeforehand. Then, after dinner, would come on him the temptation of\nreturning to his chambers, and so it would go on with him from day to\nday.\n\nOn this Friday evening the girls almost expected him, as he rarely\nlet a week pass without visiting them, and still more rarely came to\nthem on a Saturday. He found them out upon the lawn, or rather on the\nbrink of the river, and with them was standing a young man whom he\nknew well. He kissed each of the girls, and then gave his hand to the\nyoung man. \"I am glad to see you, Ralph,\" he said. \"Have you been\nhere long?\"\n\n\"As much as an hour or two, I fear. Patience will tell you. I meant\nto have got back by the 9.15 from Putney; but I have been smoking,\nand dreaming, and talking, till now it is nearly ten.\"\n\n\"There is a train at 10.30,\" said the eldest Miss Underwood.\n\n\"And another at 11.15,\" said the young man.\n\nSir Thomas was especially anxious to be alone with his daughters, but\nhe could not tell the guest to go. Nor was he justified in feeling\nany anger at his presence there,--though he did experience some prick\nof conscience in the matter. If it was wrong that his daughters\nshould be visited by a young man in his absence, the fault lay in his\nabsence, rather than with the young man for coming, or with the girls\nfor receiving him. The young man had been a ward of his own, and for\na year or two in former times had been so intimate in his house as to\nlive with his daughters almost as an elder brother might have done.\nBut young Ralph Newton had early in life taken rooms for himself\nin London, had then ceased to be a ward, and had latterly,--so Sir\nThomas understood,--lived such a life as to make him unfit to be the\ntrusted companion of his two girls. And yet there had been nothing in\nhis mode of living to make it necessary that he should be absolutely\nbanished from the villa. He had spent more money than was fitting,\nand had got into debt, and Sir Thomas had had trouble about his\naffairs. He too was an orphan,--and the nephew and the heir of an old\ncountry squire whom he never saw. What money he had received from his\nfather he had nearly spent, and it was rumoured of him that he had\nraised funds by post-obits on his uncle's life. Of all these things\nmore will be told hereafter;--but Sir Thomas,--though he had given no\ninstruction on the subject, and was averse even to allude to it,--did\nnot like to think that Ralph Newton was at the villa with the girls\nin his absence. His girls were as good as gold. He was sure of that.\nHe told himself over and over again that were it not so, he would\nnot have left them so constantly without his own care. Patience, the\nelder, was a marvel among young women for prudence, conduct, and\nproper feeling; and Clarissa, whom he had certainly ever loved the\nbetter of the two, was as far as he knew faultless;--a little more\npassionate, a little warmer, somewhat more fond of pleasure than her\nsister; but on that account only the more to be loved. Nothing that\nhe could do would make them safer than they would be by their own\nvirtue. But still he was not pleased to think that Ralph Newton was\noften at the villa. When a man such as Sir Thomas has been entrusted\nwith the charge of a young man with great expectations, he hardly\nwishes his daughter to fall in love with his ward, whether his ward\nbe prudent or imprudent in his manner of life.\n\nSir Thomas was hot and tired after his walk, and there was some\nlittle fuss in getting him soda-water and tea. And as it was plain to\nsee that things were not quite comfortable, Ralph Newton at last took\nhis departure, so as to catch the earlier of the two trains which had\nbeen mentioned. It was, nevertheless, past ten when he went;--and\nthen Sir Thomas, sitting at the open window of the drawing-room,\nagain took out the letter. \"Patience,\" he said, addressing his elder\ndaughter as he withdrew the enclosure from the envelope, \"Mary Bonner\nwill be in England in a fortnight. What shall we do for her?\" As he\nspoke he held the letter in a manner which justified the girl in\ntaking it from his hand. He allowed it to go to her, and she read it\nbefore she answered him.\n\nIt was a very sad letter, cold in its language, but still full\nof pathos. Her friends in the West Indies,--such friends as she\nhad,--had advised her to proceed to England. She was given to\nunderstand that when her father's affairs should be settled there\nwould be left to her not more than a few hundred pounds. Would her\nuncle provide for her some humble home for the present, and assist\nher in her future endeavours to obtain employment as a governess? She\ncould, she thought, teach music and French, and would endeavour to\nfit herself for the work of tuition in other respects. \"I know,\" she\nsaid, \"how very slight is my claim upon one who has never seen me,\nand who is connected with me only by my poor mother;--but perhaps you\nwill allow me to trouble you so far in my great distress.\"\n\n\"She must come here, of course, papa,\" said Patience, as she handed\nthe letter to Clarissa.\n\n\"Yes, she must come here,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"But I mean, to stay,--for always.\"\n\n\"Yes,--to stay for always. I cannot say that the arrangement is one\nto which I look forward with satisfaction. A man does not undertake\nnew duties without fears;--and especially not such a duty as this, to\nwhich I can see no end, and which I may probably be quite unable to\nperform.\"\n\n\"Papa, I am sure she will be nice,\" said Clarissa.\n\n\"But why are you sure, my dear? We will not argue that, however. She\nmust come; and we will hope that she will prove to be what Clarissa\ncalls nice. I cannot allow my sister's child to go out into the world\nas a governess while I have a home to offer her. She must come here\nas one of our household. I only hope she will not interfere with your\nhappiness.\"\n\n\"I am sure she will not,\" said Clarissa.\n\n\"We will determine that she shall add to it, and will do our best to\nmake her happy,\" said Patience.\n\n\"It is a great risk, but we must run it,\" said Sir Thomas; and so the\nmatter was settled. Then he explained to them that he intended to\ngo himself to Southampton to receive his niece, and that he would\nbring her direct from that port to her new home. Patience offered to\naccompany him on the journey, but this he declined as unnecessary.\nEverything was decided between them by eleven o'clock,--even to the\nroom which Mary Bonner should occupy, and then the girls left their\nfather, knowing well that he would not go to bed for the next four\nhours. He would sleep in his chair for the next two hours, and would\nthen wander about, or read, or perhaps sit and think of this added\ncare till the night would be half over. Nor did the two sisters go\nto bed at once. This new arrangement, so important to their father,\nwas certainly of more importance to them. He, no doubt, would still\noccupy his chambers, would still live practically alone in London,\nthough he was in theory the presiding genius of the household at\nFulham; but they must take to themselves a new sister; and they both\nknew, in spite of Clarissa's enthusiasm, that it might be that the\nnew sister would be one whom they could not love. \"I don't remember\nthat I ever heard a word about her,\" said Clarissa.\n\n\"I have been told that she is pretty. I do remember that,\" said\nPatience.\n\n\"How old is she? Younger than we, I suppose?\" Now Clarissa Underwood\nat this time was one-and-twenty, and Patience was nearly two years\nher senior.\n\n\"Oh, yes;--about nineteen, I should say. I think I have been told\nthat there were four or five older than Mary, who all died. Is it not\nstrange and terrible,--to be left alone, the last of a large family,\nwith not a relation whom one has ever seen?\"\n\n\"Poor dear girl!\"\n\n\"If she wrote the letter herself,\" continued Patience, \"I think she\nmust be clever.\"\n\n\"I am sure I could not have written a letter at all in such a\nposition,\" said Clarissa. And so they sat, almost as late as their\nfather, discussing the probable character and appearance of this\nnew relation, and the chance of their being able to love her with\nall their hearts. There was the necessity for an immediate small\nsacrifice, but as to that there was no difficulty. Hitherto the two\nsisters had occupied separate bedrooms, but now, as one chamber must\nbe given up to the stranger, it would be necessary that they should\nbe together. But there are sacrifices which entail so little pain\nthat the pleasant feeling of sacrificial devotion much more than\natones for the consequences.\n\nPatience Underwood, the elder and the taller of the two girls, was\ncertainly not pretty. Her figure was good, her hands and feet were\nsmall, and she was in all respects like a lady; but she possessed\nneither the feminine loveliness which comes so often simply from\nyouth, nor that other, rarer beauty, which belongs to the face\nitself, and is produced by its own lines and its own expression. Her\ncountenance was thin, and might perhaps have been called dry and\nhard. She was very like her father,--without, however, her father's\nnose, and the redeeming feature of her face was to be found in that\nsense of intelligence which was conveyed by her bright grey eyes.\nThere was the long chin, and there was the long upper lip, which,\nexaggerated in her father's countenance, made him so notoriously\nplain a man. And then her hair, though plentiful and long, did not\npossess that shining lustre which we love to see in girls, and which\nwe all recognise as one of the sweetest graces of girlhood. Such,\noutwardly, was Patience Underwood; and of all those who knew her well\nthere was not one so perfectly satisfied that she did want personal\nattraction as was Patience Underwood herself. But she never spoke\non the subject,--even to her sister. She did not complain; neither,\nas is much more common, did she boast that she was no beauty. Her\nsister's loveliness was very dear to her, and of that she would\nsometimes break out into enthusiastic words. But of herself,\nexternally, she said nothing. Her gifts, if she had any, were of\nanother sort; and she was by no means willing to think of herself\nas one unendowed with gifts. She was clever, and knew herself to be\nclever. She could read, and understood what she read. She saw the\ndifference between right and wrong, and believed that she saw it\nclearly. She was not diffident of herself, and certainly was not\nunhappy. She had a strong religious faith, and knew how to supplement\nthe sometimes failing happiness of this world, by trusting in the\nhappiness of the next. Were it not for her extreme anxiety in\nreference to her father, Patience Underwood would have been a happy\nwoman.\n\nClarissa, the younger, was a beauty. The fact that she was a beauty\nwas acknowledged by all who knew her, and was well known to herself.\nIt was a fact as to which there had never been a doubt since she was\nturned fifteen. She was somewhat shorter than her sister, and less\nslender. She was darker in complexion, and her hair, which was rich\nin colour as brown hair can be, was lustrous, silky, and luxuriant.\nShe wore it now, indeed, according to the fashion of the day, with a\nchignon on her head; but beneath that there were curls which escaped,\nand over her forehead it was clipped short, and was wavy, and\nimpertinent,--as is also the fashion of the day. Such as it was, she\nso wore it that a man could hardly wish it to be otherwise. Her eyes,\nunlike those of her father and sister, were blue; and in the whole\ncontour of her features there was nothing resembling theirs. The\nupper lip was short, and the chin was short and dimpled. There was\na dimple on one cheek too, a charm so much more maddening than when\nit is to be seen on both sides alike. Her nose was perfect;--not\nGrecian, nor Roman, nor Egyptian,--but simply English, only just not\nretrouss\u00c3\u00a9. There were those who said her mouth was a thought too\nwide, and her teeth too perfect,--but they were of that class of\ncritics to whom it is a necessity to cavil rather than to kiss. Added\nto all this there was a childishness of manner about her of which,\nthough she herself was somewhat ashamed, all others were enamoured.\nIt was not the childishness of very youthful years,--for she had\nalready reached the mature age of twenty-one; but the half-doubting,\nhalf-pouting, half-yielding, half-obstinate, soft, loving, lovable\nchildishness, which gives and exacts caresses, and which, when it\nis genuine, may exist to an age much beyond that which Clarissa\nUnderwood had reached.\n\nBut with all her charms, Clarissa was not so happy a girl as her\nsister. And for this lack of inward satisfaction there were at this\ntime two causes. She believed herself to be a fool, and was in that\nrespect jealous of her sister;--and she believed herself to be in\nlove, and in love almost without hope. As to her foolishness, it\nseemed to her to be a fact admitted by every one but by Patience\nherself. Not a human being came near her who did not seem to imply\nthat any question as to wisdom or judgment or erudition between\nher and her sister would be a farce. Patience could talk Italian,\ncould read German, knew, at least by name, every poet that had ever\nwritten, and was always able to say exactly what ought to be done.\nShe could make the servants love her and yet obey her, and could\nalways dress on her allowance without owing a shilling. Whereas\nClarissa was obeyed by no one, was in debt to her bootmaker and\nmilliner, and, let her struggles in the cause be as gallant as they\nmight, could not understand a word of Dante, and was aware that she\nread the \"Faery Queen\" exactly as a child performs a lesson. As to\nher love,--there was a sharper sorrow. Need the reader be told that\nRalph Newton was the hero to whom its late owner believed that her\nheart had been given? This was a sore subject, which had never as yet\nbeen mentioned frankly even between the two sisters. In truth, though\nPatience thought that there was a fancy, she did not think that there\nwas much more than fancy. And, as far as she could see, there was\nnot even fancy on the young man's part. No word had been spoken\nthat could be accepted as an expression of avowed love. So at least\nPatience believed. And she would have been very unhappy had it been\notherwise, for Ralph Newton was not,--in her opinion,--a man to whose\nlove her sister could be trusted with confidence. And yet, beyond her\nfather and sister, there was no one whom Patience loved as she did\nRalph Newton.\n\nThere had, however, been a little episode in the life of Clarissa\nUnderwood, which had tended to make her sister uneasy, and which\nthe reader may as well hear at once. There was a second Newton,\na younger brother,--but, though younger, not only in orders but\nin the possession of a living, Gregory Newton,--the Rev. Gregory\nNewton,--who in the space of a few weeks' acquaintance had fallen\ninto a fury of love for Clarissa, and in the course of three months\nhad made her as many offers, and had been as often refused. This had\nhappened in the winter and spring previous to the opening of our\nstory,--and both Patience and Sir Thomas had been well disposed\ntowards the young man's suit. He had not been committed to Sir\nThomas's charge, as had Ralph, having been brought up under the care\nof the uncle whose heir Ralph was through the obligation of legal\nsettlements. This uncle, having quarrelled with his own brother,\nsince dead, and with his heir, had nevertheless taken his other\nnephew by the hand, and had bestowed upon the young clergyman the\nliving of Newton. Gregory Newton had been brought to the villa by his\nbrother, and had at once fallen on his knees before the beauty. But\nthe beauty would have none of him, and he had gone back to his living\nin Hampshire a broken-hearted priest and swain. Now, Patience, though\nshe had never been directly so informed, feared that some partiality\nfor the unworthy Ralph had induced her sister to refuse offers from\nthe brother, who certainly was worthy. To the thinking of Patience\nUnderwood, no lot in life could be happier for a woman than to be\nthe wife of a zealous and praiseworthy parson of an English country\nparish;--no lot in life, at least, could be happier for any woman who\nintended to become a wife.\n\nSuch were the two girls at Popham Villa who were told on that evening\nthat a new sister was to be brought home to them. When the next\nmorning came they were of course still full of the subject. Sir\nThomas was to go into London after breakfast, and he intended to walk\nover the bridge and catch an early train. He was as intent on being\npunctual to time as though he were bound to be all day in Court: and,\nfond as he might be of his daughters, had already enjoyed enough\nof the comforts of home to satisfy his taste. He did love his\ndaughters;--but even with them he was not at his ease. The only\nsociety he could enjoy was that of his books or of his own thoughts,\nand the only human being whom he could endure to have long near him\nwith equanimity was Joseph Stemm. He had risen at nine, as was his\ncustom, and before ten he was bustling about with his hat and gloves.\n\"Papa,\" said Clarissa, \"when shall you be home again?\"\n\n\"I can't name a day, my dear.\"\n\n\"Papa, do come soon.\"\n\n\"No doubt I shall come soon.\" There was a slight tone of anger in his\nvoice as he answered the last entreaty, and he was evidently in a\nhurry with his hat and gloves.\n\n\"Papa,\" said Patience, \"of course we shall see you again before you\ngo to Southampton.\" The voice of the elder was quite different from\nthat of the younger daughter; and Sir Thomas, though the tone and\nmanner of the latter question was injurious to him, hardly dared to\nresent it. Yet they were not, as he thought, justified. It now wanted\ntwelve days to the date of his intended journey, and not more than\nthree or four times in his life had he been absent from home for\ntwelve consecutive days.\n\n\"Yes, my dear,\" he said, \"I shall be home before that.\"\n\n\"Because, papa, there are things to be thought of.\"\n\n\"What things?\"\n\n\"Clarissa and I had better have a second bed in our room,--unless you\nobject.\"\n\n\"You know I don't object. Have I ever objected to anything of the\nkind?\" He now stood impatient, with his hat in his hand.\n\n\"I hardly like to order things without telling you, papa. And there\nare a few other articles of furniture needed.\"\n\n\"You can get what you want. Run up to town and go to Barlow's. You\ncan do that as well as I can.\"\n\n\"But I should have liked to have settled something about our future\nway of living before Mary comes,\" said Patience in a very low voice.\n\nSir Thomas frowned, and then he answered her very slowly. \"There\ncan be nothing new settled at all. Things will go on as they are at\npresent. And I hope, Patience, you will do your best to make your\ncousin understand and receive favourably the future home which she\nwill have to inhabit.\"\n\n\"You may be sure, papa, I shall do my best,\" said Patience;--and then\nSir Thomas went.\n\nHe did return to the villa before his journey to Southampton, but\nit was only on the eve of that journey. During the interval the two\ngirls together had twice sought him at his chambers,--a liberty on\ntheir part which, as they well knew, he did not at all approve. \"Sir\nThomas is very busy,\" old Stemm would say, shaking his head, even to\nhis master's daughters, \"and if you wouldn't mind--\" Then he would\nmake a feint as though to close the door, and would go through\nvarious manoeuvres of defence before he would allow the fort to be\nstormed. But Clarissa would ridicule old Stemm to his face, and\nPatience would not allow herself to be beaten by him. On their second\nvisit they did make their way into their father's sanctum,--and\nthey never knew whether in truth he had been there when they called\nbefore. \"Old Stemm doesn't in the least mind what lies he tells,\"\nClarissa had said. To this Patience made no reply, feeling that the\nresponsibility for those figments might not perhaps lie exclusively\non old Stemm's shoulders.\n\n\"My dears, this is such an out-of-the-way place for you,\" Sir Thomas\nsaid, as soon as the girls had made good their entrance. But the\ngirls had so often gone through all this before, that they now\nregarded but little what ejaculations of that nature were made to\nthem.\n\n\"I have come to show you this list, papa,\" said Patience. Sir Thomas\ntook the list, and found that it contained various articles for\nbedroom and kitchen use,--towels, sheets, pots and pans, knives and\nforks, and even a set of curtains and a carpet.\n\n\"I shouldn't have thought that a girl of eighteen would have wanted\nall these things,--a new corkscrew, for instance,--but if she does,\nas I told you before, you must get them.\"\n\n\"Of course they are not all for Mary,\" said Patience.\n\n\"The fact is, papa,\" said Clarissa, \"you never do look to see how\nthings are getting worn out.\"\n\n\"Clarissa!\" exclaimed the angry father.\n\n\"Indeed, papa, if you were more at home and saw these things,\" began\nPatience--\n\n\"I have no doubt it is all right. Get what you want. Go to Barlow's\nand to Green's, and to Block and Blowhard. Don't let there be any\nbills, that's all. I will give you cheques when you get the accounts.\nAnd now, my dears,--I am in the middle of work which will not\nbear interruption.\" Then they left him, and when he did come to\nthe villa on the evening before his journey, most of the new\narticles,--including the corkscrew,--were already in the house.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED ON THE LAWN AT POPHAM VILLA.\n\n\nSir Thomas started for Southampton on a Friday, having understood\nthat the steamer from St. Thomas would reach the harbour on Saturday\nmorning. He would then immediately bring Mary Bonner up to London\nand down to Fulham;--and there certainly had come to be a tacit\nunderstanding that he would stay at home on the following Sunday. On\nthe Friday evening the girls were alone at the villa; but there was\nnothing in this, as it was the life to which they were accustomed.\nThey habitually dined at two, calling the meal lunch,--then had a\nfive or six o'clock tea,--and omitted altogether the ceremony of\ndinner. They had local acquaintances, with whom occasionally they\nwould spend their evenings; and now and then an old maid or two,--now\nand then also a young maid or two would drop in on them. But it was\ntheir habit to be alone. During these days of which we are speaking\nClarissa would take her \"Faery Queen,\" and would work hard perhaps\nfor half an hour. Then the \"Faery Queen\" would be changed for a\nnovel, and she would look up from her book to see whether Patience\nhad turned upon her any glance of reprobation. Patience, in the\nmeantime, would sit with unsullied conscience at her work. And so\nthe evenings would glide by; and in these soft summer days the girls\nwould sit out upon the lawn, and would watch the boats of London\nwatermen as they passed up and down below the bridge. On this very\nevening, the last on which they were to be together before the\narrival of their cousin,--Patience came out upon the lawn with her\nhat and gloves. \"I am going across to Miss Spooner's,\" she said;\n\"will you come?\" But Clarissa was idle, and making some little joke,\nnot very much to the honour of Miss Spooner, declared that she was\nhot and tired, and had a headache, and would stay at home. \"Don't be\nlong, Patty,\" she said; \"it is such a bore to be alone.\" Patience\npromised a speedy return, and, making her way to the gate, crossed\nthe road to Miss Spooner's abode. She was hardly out of sight when\nthe nose of a wager boat was driven up against the bank, and there\nwas Ralph Newton, sitting in a blue Jersey shirt, with a straw hat\nand the perspiration running from his handsome brow. Clarissa did not\nsee him till he whistled to her, and then she started, and laughed,\nand ran down to the boat, and hardly remembered that she was quite\nalone till she had taken his hand. \"I don't think I'll come out, but\nyou must get me some soda-water and brandy,\" said Ralph. \"Where's\nPatience?\"\n\n\"Patience has gone out to see an old maid; and we haven't got any\nbrandy.\"\n\n\"I am so hot,\" said Ralph, carefully extricating himself from the\nboat. \"You have got sherry?\"\n\n\"Yes, we've got sherry, and port wine, and Gladstone;\" and away she\nwent to get him such refreshment as the villa possessed.\n\nHe drank his sherry and soda-water, and lit his pipe, and lay there\non the lawn, as though he were quite at home; and Clarissa ministered\nto him,--unconscious of any evil. He had been brought up with them on\nterms of such close intimacy that she was entitled to regard him as\na brother,--almost as a brother,--if only she were able so to regard\nhim. It was her practice to call him Ralph, and her own name was as\ncommon to him as though she were in truth his sister. \"And what do\nyou think of this new cousin?\" he asked.\n\n\n[Illustration: He drank his sherry and soda-water, and lit his pipe,\nand lay there on the lawn, as though he were quite at home . . .]\n\n\n\"I can think nothing as yet;--but I mean to like her.\"\n\n\"I mean to hate her furiously,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"That is nonsense. She will be nothing to you. You needn't even see\nher unless you please. But, Ralph, do put your jacket on. I'm sure\nyou'll catch cold.\" And she went down, and hooked his jacket for him\nout of the boat, and put it over his shoulders. \"I won't have you\nthrow it off,\" she said; \"if you come here you must do as you're\ntold.\"\n\n\"You needn't have knocked the pipe out of my mouth all the same. What\nis she like, I wonder?\"\n\n\"Very,--very beautiful, I'm told.\"\n\n\"A kind of tropical Venus,--all eyes, and dark skin, and black hair,\nand strong passions, and apt to murder people;--but at the same\ntime so lazy that she is never to do anything either for herself or\nanybody else;--wouldn't fetch a fellow's jacket for him, let him be\ncatching cold ever so fast.\"\n\n\"She wouldn't fetch yours, I dare say.\"\n\n\"And why shouldn't she?\"\n\n\"Because she doesn't know you.\"\n\n\"They soon get to know one,--girls of that sort. I'm told that in\nthe West Indies you become as thick as thieves in half a morning's\nflirtation, and are expected to propose at the second meeting.\"\n\n\"That is not to be your way with our cousin, I can assure you.\"\n\n\"But these proposals out there never mean much. You may be engaged to\nhalf a dozen girls at the same time, and be sure that each of them\nwill be engaged to half-a-dozen men. There's some comfort in that,\nyou know.\"\n\n\"Oh, Ralph!\"\n\n\"That's what they tell me. I haven't been there. I shall come and\nlook at her, you know.\"\n\n\"Of course you will.\"\n\n\"And if she is very lovely--\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"I do like pretty girls, you know.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about it.\"\n\n\"I wonder what uncle Gregory would say if I were to marry a West\nIndian! He wouldn't say much to me, because we never speak, but he'd\nlead poor Greg a horrid life. He'd be sure to think she was a nigger,\nor at least a Creole. But I shan't do that.\"\n\n\"You might do worse, Ralph.\"\n\n\"But I might do much better.\" As he said this, he looked up into her\nface, with all the power of his eyes, and poor Clarissa could only\nblush. She knew what he meant, and knew that she was showing him that\nshe was conscious. She would have given much not to blush, and not to\nhave been so manifestly conscious, but she had no power to control\nherself. \"I might do much better,\" he said. \"Don't you think so?\"\n\nAs far as she could judge of her own feelings at this moment, in the\nabsolute absence of any previous accurate thought on the subject, she\nfancied that a real, undoubted, undoubting, trustworthy engagement\nwith Ralph Newton would make her the happiest girl in England. She\nhad never told herself that she was in love with him; she had never\nflattered herself that he was in love with her;--she had never\nbalanced the matter in her mind as a contingency likely to occur; but\nnow, at this moment, as he lay there smoking his pipe and looking\nfull into her blushing face, she did think that to have him for her\nown lover would be joy enough for her whole life. She knew that he\nwas idle, extravagant, fond of pleasure, and,--unsteady, as she in\nher vocabulary would be disposed to describe the character which she\nbelieved to be his. But in her heart of hearts she liked unsteadiness\nin men, if it were not carried too far. Ralph's brother, the parson,\nas to whom she was informed that he possessed every virtue incident\nto humanity, and who was quite as good-looking as his brother, had\nutterly failed to touch her heart. A black coat and a white cravat\nwere antipathetic to her. Ralph, as he lay on the green sward, hot,\nwith linen trousers and a coloured flannel shirt, with a small straw\nhat stuck on the edge of his head, with nothing round his throat, and\nhis jacket over his shoulder, with a pipe in his mouth and an empty\nglass beside him, was to her, in externals, the beau-ideal of a\nyoung man. And then, though he was unsteady, extravagant, and idle,\nhis sins were not so deep as to exclude him from her father's and\nher sister's favour. He was there, on the villa lawn, not as an\ninterloper, but by implied permission. Though she made for herself\nno argument on the matter,--not having much time just now for\narguing,--she felt that it was her undoubted privilege to be\nmade love to by Ralph Newton, if he and she pleased so to amuse\nthemselves. She had never been told not to be made love to by him. Of\ncourse she would not engage herself without her father's permission.\nOf course she would tell Patience if Ralph should say anything very\nspecial to her. But she had a right to be made love to if she liked\nit;--and in this case she would like it. But when Ralph looked at\nher, and asked her whether he might not do better than marry her West\nIndian cousin, she had not a word with which to answer him. He smoked\non for some seconds in silence still looking at her, while she stood\nover him blushing. Then he spoke again. \"I think I might do a great\ndeal better.\" But still she had not a word for him.\n\n\"Ah;--I suppose I must be off,\" he said, jumping up on his legs, and\nflinging his jacket over his arm. \"Patience will be in soon.\"\n\n\"I expect her every minute.\"\n\n\"If I were to say,--something uncivil about Patience, I suppose you\nwouldn't like it?\"\n\n\"Certainly, I shouldn't like it.\"\n\n\"Only just to wish she were at,--Jericho?\"\n\n\"Nonsense, Ralph.\"\n\n\"Yes; that would be nonsense. And the chances are, you know, that\nyou would be at Jericho with her. Dear, dear Clary,--you know I love\nyou.\" Then he put his right arm round her waist, pipe and all, and\nkissed her.\n\nShe certainly had expected no such assault,--had not only not thought\nof it, but had not known it to be among the possibilities that might\noccur to her. She had never been so treated before. One other lover\nshe had had,--as we know; but by him she had been treated with the\ndeference due by an inferior to a superior being. It would have been\nvery nice if Ralph would have told her that he loved her,--but this\nwas not nice. That had been done which she would not dare to tell to\nPatience,--which she could not have endured that Patience should have\nseen. She was bound to resent it;--but how? She stood silent for a\nmoment, and then burst into tears. \"You are not angry with me,\nClary?\" he said.\n\n\"I am angry;--very angry. Go away. I will never speak to you again.\"\n\n\"You know how dearly I love you.\"\n\n\"I don't love you at all. You have insulted me, and I will never\nforgive you. Go away.\" At this moment the step of Patience coming up\nfrom the gate was heard upon the gravel. Clarissa's first thought\nwhen she heard it was to hide her tears. Though the man had injured\nher,--insulted her,--her very last resource would be to complain to\nothers of the injury or the insult. It must be hidden in her own\nbreast,--but remembered always. Forgotten it could not be,--nor, as\nshe thought at the moment, forgiven. But, above all, it must not\nbe repeated. As to any show of anger against the sinner, that was\nimpossible to her,--because it was so necessary that the sin should\nbe hidden.\n\n\"What;--Ralph? Have you been here long?\" asked Patience, looking with\nsomewhat suspicious eyes at Clarissa's back, which was turned to her.\n\n\"About half an hour,--waiting for you, and smoking and drinking\nsoda-water. I have a boat here, and I must be off now.\"\n\n\"You'll have the tide with you,\" said Clarissa, with an effort.\n\n\"There is a tide in the affairs of men,\" said Ralph, with a forced\nlaugh. \"My affairs shall at once take advantage of this tide. I'll\ncome again very soon to see the new cousin. Good-bye, girls.\" Then\nhe inserted himself into his boat, and took himself off, without\nbestowing even anything of a special glance upon Clarissa.\n\n\"Is there anything the matter?\" Patience asked.\n\n\"No;--only why did you stay all the evening with that stupid old\nwoman, when you promised me that you would be back in ten minutes?\"\n\n\"I said nothing about ten minutes, Clary; and, after all, I haven't\nbeen an hour gone. Miss Spooner is in trouble about her tenant, who\nwon't pay the rent, and she had to tell me all about it.\"\n\n\"Stupid old woman!\"\n\n\"Have you and Ralph been quarrelling, Clary?\"\n\n\"No;--why should we quarrel?\"\n\n\"There seems to have been something wrong.\"\n\n\"It's so stupid being found all alone here. It makes one feel that\none is so desolate. I do wish papa would live with us like other\ngirls' fathers. As he won't, it would be much better not to let\npeople come at all.\"\n\nPatience was sure that something had happened,--and that that\nsomething must have reference to the guise of lover either assumed or\nnot assumed by Ralph Newton. She accused her sister of no hypocrisy,\nbut she was aware that Clarissa's words were wild, not expressing the\ngirl's thoughts, and spoken almost at random. Something must be said,\nand therefore these complaints had been made. \"Clary, dear; don't you\nlike Ralph?\" she asked.\n\n\"No. That is;--oh yes, I like him, of course. My head aches and I'll\ngo to bed.\"\n\n\"Wait a few minutes, Clary. Something has disturbed you. Has it not?\"\n\n\"Everything disturbs me.\"\n\n\"But if there is anything special, won't you tell me?\" There had\nbeen something very special, which Clarissa certainly would not tell.\n\"What has he said to you? I don't think he would be simply cross to\nyou.\"\n\n\"He has not been cross at all.\"\n\n\"What is it then? Well;--if you won't tell me, I think that you are\nafraid of me. We never yet have been afraid of each other.\" Then\nthere was a pause. \"Clary, has he said that,--he loves you?\" There\nwas another pause. Clarissa thought it all over, and for a moment was\nnot quite certain whether any such sweet assurance had or had not\nbeen given to her. Then she remembered his words;--\"You know how\ndearly I love you.\" But ought they to be sweet to her now? Had he\nnot so offended her that there could never be forgiveness? And if\nno forgiveness, how then could his love be sweet to her? Patience\nwaited, and then repeated her question. \"Tell me, Clary; what has he\nsaid to you?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Do you love him, Clary?\"\n\n\"No. I hate him.\"\n\n\"Hate him, Clary? You did not use to hate him. You did not hate him\nyesterday? You would not hate him without a cause. My darling, tell\nme what it means! If you and I do not trust each other what will\nthe world be to us? There is no one else to whom we can tell our\ntroubles.\" Nevertheless Clarissa would not tell this trouble. \"Why do\nyou say that you hate him?\"\n\n\"I don't know why. Oh, dear Patty, why do you go on so? Yes; he did\nsay that he loved me;--there.\"\n\n\"And did that make you unhappy? It need not make you unhappy, though\nyou should refuse him. When his brother asked you to marry him, that\ndid not make you unhappy.\"\n\n\"Yes it did;--very.\"\n\n\"And is this the same?\"\n\n\"No;--it is quite different.\"\n\n\"I am afraid, Clary, that Ralph Newton would not make a good husband.\nHe is extravagant and in debt, and papa would not like it.\"\n\n\"Then papa should not let him come here just as he pleases and\nwhenever he likes. It is papa's fault;--that is to say it would be if\nthere were anything in it.\"\n\n\"Is there nothing in it, Clary? What answer did you make when he told\nyou that he loved you?\"\n\n\"You came, and I made no answer. I do so wish that you had come\nbefore.\" She wanted to tell her sister everything but the one thing,\nbut was unable to do so because the one thing affected the other\nthings so vitally. As it was, Patience, finding that she could press\nher questions no further, was altogether in the dark. That Ralph had\nmade a declaration of love to her sister she did know; but in what\nmanner Clarissa had received it she could not guess. She had hitherto\nfeared that Clary was too fond of the young man, but Clary would now\nonly say that she hated him. But the matter would soon be set at\nrest. Ralph Newton would now, no doubt, go to their father. If Sir\nThomas would permit it, this new-fangled hatred of Clary's would,\nPatience thought, soon be overcome. If, however,--as was more\nprobable,--Sir Thomas should violently disapprove, then there would\nbe no more visits from Ralph Newton to the villa. As there had been a\ndeclaration of love, of course their father would be informed of it\nat once. Patience, having so resolved, allowed her sister to go to\nher bed without further questioning.\n\nIn Clarissa's own bosom the great offence had been forgiven,--or\nrather condoned before the morning. Her lover had been very cruel to\nher, very wicked, and most unkind;--especially unkind in this, that\nhe had turned to absolute pain a moment of life which might have been\nof all moments the fullest of joy; and especially cruel in this, that\nhe had so treated her that she could not look forward to future joy\nwithout alloy. She could forgive him;--yes. But she could not endure\nthat he should think that she would forgive him. She was willing\nto blot out the offence, as a thing by itself, in an island of her\nlife,--of which no one should ever think again. Was she to lose her\nlover for ever because she did not forgive him! If they could only\ncome to some agreement that the offence should be acknowledged to\nbe heinous, unpardonable, but committed in temporary madness, and\nthat henceforward it should be buried in oblivion! Such agreement,\nhowever, was impossible. There could be no speech about the matter.\nWas she or was she not to lose her lover for ever because he had done\nthis wicked thing? During the night she made up her mind that she\ncould not afford to pay such a price for the sake of avenging virtue.\nFor the future she would be on her guard! Wicked and heartless man,\nwho had robbed her of so much! And yet how charming he had been to\nher as he looked into her eyes, and told her that he could do very\nmuch better than fall in love with her West Indian cousin. Then she\nthought of the offence again. Ah, if only a time might come in which\nthey should be engaged together as man and wife with the consent of\neverybody! Then there would be no more offences.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nMARY BONNER.\n\n\nWhile Clarissa Underwood was being kissed on the lawn at Popham\nVilla, Sir Thomas was sitting, very disconsolate, in a private\nroom at the Dolphin, in Southampton. It had required no great\nconsideration to induce him to resolve that a home should be given\nby him to his niece. Though he was a man so weak that he could\nallow himself to shun from day to day his daily duty,--and to do\nthis so constantly as to make up out of various omissions, small in\nthemselves, a vast aggregate of misconduct,--still he was one who\nwould certainly do what his conscience prompted him to be right in\nany great matter as to which the right and the wrong appeared to him\nto be clearly defined. Though he loved his daughters dearly, he could\nleave them from day to day almost without protection,--because each\nday's fault in so doing was of itself but small. This new niece of\nhis he certainly did not love at all. He had never seen her. He was\nalmost morbidly fearful of new responsibilities. He expected nothing\nbut trouble in thus annexing a new unknown member to his family. And\nyet he had decided upon doing it, because the duty to be done was\ngreat enough to be clearly marked,--demanding an immediate resolve,\nand capable of no postponement. But, as he thought of it, sitting\nalone on the eve of the girl's coming, he was very uneasy. What was\nhe to do with her if he found her to be one difficult to manage,\nself-willed, vexatious, or,--worse again,--ill-conditioned as to\nconduct, and hurtful to his own children? Should it even become\nimperative upon him to be rid of her, how should riddance be\neffected? And then what would she think of him and his habits of\nlife?\n\nAnd this brought him to other reflections. Might it not be possible\nutterly to break up that establishment of his in Southampton\nBuildings, so that he would be forced by the necessity of things to\nlive at his home,--at some home which he would share with the girls?\nHe knew himself well enough to be sure that while those chambers\nremained in his possession, as long as that bedroom and bed were at\nhis command, he could not extricate himself from the dilemma. Day\nafter day the temptation was too great for him. And he hated the\nvilla. There was nothing there that he could do. He had no books at\nthe villa; and,--so he averred,--there was something in the air of\nFulham which prevented him from reading books when he brought them\nthere. No! He must break altogether fresh ground, and set up a new\nestablishment. One thing was clear; he could not now do this before\nMary Bonner's arrival, and therefore there was nothing to create any\nspecial urgency. He had hoped that his girls would marry, so that\nhe might be left to live alone in his chambers,--waited upon by old\nStemm,--without sin on his part; but he was beginning to discover\nthat girls do not always get married out of the way in their first\nbloom. And now he was taking to himself another girl! He must, he\nknew, give over all hope of escape in that direction. He was very\nuneasy; and when quite late at night,--or rather, early in the\nmorning,--he took himself to bed, his slumbers were not refreshing.\nThe truth was that no air suited him for sleeping except the air of\nSouthampton Buildings.\n\nThe packet from St. Thomas was to be in the harbour at eight o'clock\nthe next morning,--telegrams from Cape Clear, The Lizard, Eddystone\nLighthouse, and where not, having made all that as certain as\nsun-rising. At eight o'clock he was down on the quay, and there was\nthe travelling city of the Royal Atlantic Steam Mail Packet Company\nat that moment being warped into the harbour. The ship as he walked\nalong the jetty was so near to him that he could plainly see the\nfaces of the passengers on deck,--men and women, girls and children,\nall dressed up to meet their friends on shore, crowding the sides of\nthe vessel in their eagerness to be among the first to get on shore.\nHe anxiously scanned the faces of the ladies that he might guess\nwhich was to be the lady that was to be to him almost the same as a\ndaughter. He saw not one as to whom he could say that he had a hope.\nSome there were in the crowd, some three or four, as to whom he\nacknowledged that he had a fear. At last he remembered that his girl\nwould necessarily be in deep mourning. He saw two young women in\nblack;--but there was nothing to prepossess him about either of them.\nOne of them was insignificant and very plain. The other was fat and\nuntidy. They neither of them looked like ladies. What if fate should\nhave sent to him as a daughter,--as a companion for his girls,--that\nfat, untidy, ill-bred looking young woman! As it happened, the\nill-bred looking young woman whom he feared, was a cook who had\nmarried a ship-steward, had gone out among the islands with her\nhusband, had found that the speculation did not answer, and was now\nreturning in the hope of earning her bread in her old vocation. Of\nthis woman Sir Thomas Underwood was in great dread.\n\nBut at last he was on board, and whispered his question to the\npurser. Miss Bonner! Oh, yes; Miss Bonner was on board. Was he Sir\nThomas Underwood, Miss Bonner's uncle? The purser evidently knew all\nabout it, and there was something in his tone which seemed to assure\nSir Thomas that the fat, untidy woman and his niece could not be\none and the same person. The purser had just raised his cap to Sir\nThomas, and had turned towards the cabin-stairs to go in search of\nthe lady herself; but he was stopped immediately by Miss Bonner\nherself. The purser did his task very well,--said some slightest word\nto introduce the uncle and the niece together, and then vanished. Sir\nThomas blushed, shuffled with his feet, and put out both his hands.\nHe was shy, astonished, and frightened,--and did not know what to\nsay. The girl came up to him, took his hand in hers, holding it\nfor a moment, and then kissed it. \"I did not think you would come\nyourself,\" she said.\n\n\"Of course I have come myself. My girls are at home, and will receive\nyou to-night.\" She said nothing further then, but again raised his\nhand and kissed it.\n\nIt is hardly too much to say that Sir Thomas Underwood was in a\ntremble as he gazed upon his niece. Had she been on the deck as\nhe walked along the quay, and had he noted her, he would not have\ndared to think that such a girl as that was coming to his house. He\ndeclared to himself at once that she was the most lovely young woman\nhe had ever seen. She was tall and somewhat large, with fair hair, of\nwhich now but very little could be seen, with dark eyes, and perfect\neyebrows, and a face which, either for colour or lines of beauty,\nmight have been taken as a model for any female saint or martyr.\nThere was a perfection of symmetry about it,--and an assertion of\nintelligence combined with the loveliness which almost frightened her\nuncle. For there was something there, also, beyond intelligence and\nloveliness. We have heard of \"an eye to threaten and command.\" Sir\nThomas did not at this moment tell himself that Mary Bonner had such\nan eye, but he did involuntarily and unconsciously acknowledge to\nhimself that over such a young lady as this whom he now saw before\nhim, it would be very difficult for him to exercise parental control.\nHe had heard that she was nineteen, but it certainly seemed to him\nthat she was older than his own daughters. As to Clary, there could\nbe no question between the two girls as to which of them would\nexercise authority over the other,--not by force of age,--but by dint\nof character, will, and fitness. And this Mary Bonner, who now shone\nbefore him as a goddess almost, a young woman to whom no ordinary\nman would speak without that kind of trepidation which goddesses do\ninflict on ordinary men, had proposed to herself,--to go out as a\ngoverness! Indeed, at this very moment such, probably, was her own\nidea. As yet she had received no reply to the letter she had written\nother than that which was now conveyed by her uncle's presence.\n\nA few questions were asked as to the voyage. No;--she had not been\nat all ill. \"I have almost feared,\" she said, \"to reach England,\nthinking I should be so desolate.\" \"We will not let you be desolate,\"\nsaid Sir Thomas, brightening up a little under the graciousness of\nthe goddess's demeanour. \"My girls are looking forward to your coming\nwith the greatest delight.\" Then she asked some question as to her\ncousins, and Sir Thomas thought that there was majesty even in her\nvoice. It was low, soft, and musical; but yet, even in that as in her\neye, there was something that indicated a power of command.\n\nHe had no servant with him to assist in looking after her luggage.\nOld Stemm was the only man in his employment, and he could hardly\nhave brought Stemm down to Southampton on such an errand. But he\nsoon found that everybody about the ship was ready to wait upon Miss\nBonner. Even the captain came to take a special farewell of her, and\nthe second officer seemed to have nothing to do but to look after\nher. The doctor was at her elbow to the last;--and all her boxes and\ntrunks seemed to extricate themselves from the general mass with a\nreadiness which is certainly not experienced by ordinary passengers.\nThere are certain favours in life which are very charming,--but very\nunjust to others, and which we may perhaps lump under the name of\npriority of service. Money will hardly buy it. When money does buy\nit, there is no injustice. When priority of service is had, like a\ncoach-and-four, by the man who can afford to pay for it, industry,\nwhich is the source of wealth, receives its fitting reward. Rank\nwill often procure it; most unjustly,--as we, who have no rank, feel\nsometimes with great soreness. Position other than that of rank,\nofficial position or commercial position, will secure it in certain\ncases. A railway train is stopped at a wrong place for a railway\ndirector, or a post-office manager gets his letters taken after time.\nThese, too, are grievances. But priority of service is perhaps more\nreadily accorded to feminine beauty, and especially to unprotected\nfeminine beauty, than to any other form of claim. Whether or no this\nis ever felt as a grievance, ladies who are not beautiful may perhaps\nbe able to say. There flits across our memory at the present moment\nsome reminiscence of angry glances at the too speedy attendance\ngiven by custom-house officers to pretty women. But this priority of\nservice is, we think, if not deserved, at least so natural, as to\ntake it out of the catalogue of evils of which complaint should be\nmade. One might complain with as much avail that men will fall in\nlove with pretty girls instead of with those who are ugly! On the\npresent occasion Sir Thomas was well contented. He was out of the\nship, and through the Custom House, and at the railway station, and\nback at the inn before the struggling mass of passengers had found\nout whether their longed-for boxes had or had not come with them\nin the ship. And then Miss Bonner took it all,--not arrogantly, as\nthough it were her due; but just as the grass takes rain or the\nflowers sunshine. These good things came to her from heaven, and\nno doubt she was thankful. But they came to her so customarily, as\ndoes a man's dinner to him, or his bed, that she could not manifest\nsurprise at what was done for her.\n\n\n[Illustration: Even the captain came to take a special farewell of\nher . . .]\n\n\nSir Thomas hardly spoke to her except about her journey and her\nluggage till they were down together in the sitting-room at the inn.\nThen he communicated to her his proposal as to her future life. It\nwas right, he thought, that she should know at once what he intended.\nTwo hours ago, before he had seen her, he had thought of telling her\nsimply where she was to live, and of saying that he would find a home\nfor her. Now he found it expedient to place the matter in a different\nlight. He would offer her the shelter of his roof as though she were\na queen who might choose among her various palaces. \"Mary,\" he said,\n\"we hope that you will stay with us altogether.\"\n\n\"To live with you,--do you mean?\"\n\n\"Certainly to live with us.\"\n\n\"I have no right to expect such an offer as that.\"\n\n\"But every right to accept it, my dear, when it is made. That is if\nit suits you.\"\n\n\"I had not dreamed of that. I thought that perhaps you would let me\ncome to you for a few weeks,--till I should know what to do.\"\n\n\"You shall come and be one of us altogether, my dear, if you think\nthat you will like it. My girls have no nearer relative than you. And\nwe are not so barbarous as to turn our backs on a new-found cousin.\"\nShe again kissed his hand, and then turned away from him and wept.\n\"You feel it all strange now,\" he said, \"but I hope we shall be able\nto make you comfortable.\"\n\n\"I have been so lonely,\" she sobbed out amidst her tears.\n\nHe had not dared to say a word to her about her father, whose\ndeath had taken place not yet three months since. Of his late\nbrother-in-law he had known little or nothing, except that the\nGeneral had been a man who always found it difficult to make\nboth ends meet, and who had troubled him frequently, not exactly\nfor loans, but in regard to money arrangements which had been\ndisagreeable to him. Whether General Bonner had or had not been an\naffectionate father he had never heard. There are men who, in Sir\nThomas's position, would have known all about such a niece after a\nfew hours' acquaintance; but our lawyer was not such a man. Though\nthe girl seemed to him to be everything that was charming, he did not\ndare to question her; and when they arrived at the station in London,\nno word had as yet been said about the General.\n\nAs they were having the luggage piled on the top of a cab, the fat\ncook passed along the platform. \"I hope you are more comfortable now,\nMrs. Woods,\" said Mary Bonner, with a smile as sweet as May, while\nshe gave her hand to the woman.\n\n\"Thank'ee, Miss; I'm better; but it's only a moil of trouble, one\nthing as well as t'other.\" Mrs. Woods was evidently very melancholy\nat the contemplation of her prospects.\n\n\"I hope you'll find yourself comfortable now.\" Then she whispered to\nSir Thomas;--\"She is a poor young woman whose husband has ill used\nher, and she lost her only child, and has now come here to earn her\nbread. She isn't nice looking, but she is so good!\" Sir Thomas did\nnot dare to tell Mary Bonner that he had already noticed Mrs. Wood,\nand that he had conceived the idea that Mrs. Wood was the niece of\nwhom he had come in search.\n\nThey made the journey at once to Fulham in the cab, and Sir Thomas\nfound it to be very long. He was proud of his new niece, but he did\nnot know what to say to her. And he felt that she, though he was sure\nthat she was clever, gave him no encouragement to speak. It was all\nvery well while, with her beautiful eyes full of tears, she had gone\nthrough the ceremony of kissing his hand in token of her respect and\ngratitude;--but that had been done often enough, and could not very\nwell be repeated in the cab. So they sat silent, and he was rejoiced\nwhen he saw those offensive words, Popham Villa, on the posts of his\ngateway. \"We have only a humble little house, my dear,\" he said, as\nthey turned in. She looked at him and smiled. \"I believe you West\nIndians generally are lodged very sumptuously.\"\n\n\"Papa had a large straggling place up in the hills, but it was\nanything but sumptuous. I do love the idea of an English home, where\nthings are neat and nice. Oh, dear;--how lovely! That is the River\nThames;--isn't it? How very beautiful!\" Then the two girls were at\nthe door of the cab, and the newcomer was enveloped in the embraces\nof her cousins.\n\nSir Thomas, as he walked along the banks of the river while the young\nladies prepared each other for dinner, reflected that he had never in\nhis life done such a day's work before as he had just accomplished.\nWhen he had married a wife, that indeed had been a great piece of\nbusiness; but it had been done slowly,--for he had been engaged four\nyears,--and he had of course been much younger at that period. Now he\nhad brought into his family a new inmate who would force him in his\nold age to change all his habits of life. He did not think that he\nwould dare to neglect Mary Bonner, and to stay in London while she\nlived at the villa. He was almost sorry that he had ever heard of\nMary Bonner, in spite of her beauty, and although he had as yet been\nable to find in her no cause of complaint. She was ladylike and\nquiet;--but yet he was afraid of her. When she came down into the\ndrawing-room with her hand clasped in that of Clarissa, he was still\nmore afraid of her. She was dressed all in black, with the utmost\nsimplicity,--with nothing on her by way of ornament beyond a few\nlarge black beads; but yet she seemed to him to be splendid. There\nwas a grace of motion about her that was almost majestic. Clary was\nvery pretty,--very pretty, indeed; but Clary was just the girl that\nan old gentleman likes to fetch him his slippers and give him his\ntea. Sir Thomas felt that, old as he was, it would certainly be his\nbusiness to give Mary Bonner her tea.\n\nThe two girls contrived to say a few words to their father that night\nbefore they joined Mary amidst her trunks in her bedroom. \"Papa,\nisn't she lovely?\" said Clarissa.\n\n\"She certainly is a very handsome young woman.\"\n\n\"And not a bit like what I expected,\" continued Clary. \"Of course\nI knew she was good-looking. I had always heard that. But I thought\nthat she would have been a sort of West Indian girl, dark, and lazy,\nand selfish. Ralph was saying that is what they are out there.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose that Ralph knows anything about it,\" said Sir\nThomas. \"And what do you say of your new cousin, Patience?\"\n\n\"I think I shall love her dearly. She is so gentle and sweet.\"\n\n\"But she is not at all what you expected?\" demanded Clarissa.\n\n\"I hardly know what I expected,\" replied the prudent Patience. \"But\ncertainly I did not expect anything so lovely as she is. Of course,\nwe can't know her yet; but as far as one can judge, I think I shall\nlike her.\"\n\n\"But she is so magnificently beautiful!\" said the energetic Clarissa.\n\n\"I think she is,\" said Sir Thomas. \"And I quite admit that it is a\nkind of beauty to surprise one. It did surprise me. Had not one of\nyou better go up-stairs to her?\" Then both the girls bounded off to\nassist their cousin in her chamber.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nMR. NEEFIT AND HIS FAMILY.\n\n\nMr. Neefit was a breeches-maker in Conduit Street, of such\nrepute that no hunting man could be said to go decently into the\nhunting field unless decorated by a garment made in Mr. Neefit's\nestablishment. His manipulation of leather was something marvellous;\nand in latter years he had added to his original art,--an art which\nhad at first been perfect rather than comprehensive,--an exquisite\nskill in cords, buckskins, and such like materials. When his trade\nwas becoming prosperous he had thought of degenerating into a tailor,\nadding largely to his premises, and of compensating his pride by the\nprospects of great increase to his fortune; but an angel of glory had\nwhispered to him to let well alone, and he was still able to boast\nthat all his measurements had been confined to the legs of sportsmen.\nInstead of extending his business he had simply extended his price,\nand had boldly clapped on an extra half-guinea to every pair that he\nsupplied. The experiment was altogether successful, and when it was\nheard by the riding men of the City that Mr. Neefit's prices were\nundoubtedly higher than those of any other breeches-maker in London,\nand that he had refused to supply breeches for the grooms of a\nMarquis because the Marquis was not a hunting man, the riding men\nof the City flocked to him in such numbers, that it became quite a\ncommon thing for them to give their orders in June and July, so that\nthey might not be disappointed when November came round. Mr. Neefit\nwas a prosperous man, but he had his troubles. Now, it was a great\ntrouble to him that some sporting men would be so very slow in paying\nfor the breeches in which they took pride!\n\nMr. Neefit's fortune had not been rapid in early life. He had begun\nwith a small capital and a small establishment, and even now his\nplace of business was very limited in size. He had been clever enough\nto make profit even out of its smallness,--and had contrived that\nit should be understood that the little back room in which men were\nmeasured was so diminutive because it did not suit his special\nbusiness to welcome a crowd. It was his pride, he said, to wait upon\nhunting men,--but with the garments of the world at large he wished\nto have no concern whatever. In the outer shop, looking into Conduit\nStreet, there was a long counter on which goods were unrolled for\ninspection; and on which an artist, the solemnity of whose brow and\nwhose rigid silence betokened the nature of his great employment,\nwas always cutting out leather. This grave man was a German, and\nthere was a rumour among young sportsmen that old Neefit paid\nthis highly-skilled operator \u00c2\u00a3600 a year for his services! Nobody\nknew as he did how each morsel of leather would behave itself\nunder the needle, or could come within two hairbreadths of him\nin accuracy across the kneepan. As for measuring, Mr. Neefit did\nthat himself,--almost always. To be measured by Mr. Neefit was as\nessential to perfection as to be cut out for by the German. There\nwere rumours, indeed, that from certain classes of customers Mr.\nNeefit and the great foreigner kept themselves personally aloof. It\nwas believed that Mr. Neefit would not condescend to measure a retail\ntradesman. Latterly, indeed, there had arisen a doubt whether he\nwould lay his august hand on a stockbroker's leg; though little\nWallop, one of the young glories of Capel Court, swears that he is\nhandled by him every year. \"Confound 'is impudence,\" says Wallop;\n\"I'd like to see him sending a foreman to me. And as for cutting,\nd'you think I don't know Bawwah's 'and!\" The name of the foreign\nartist is not exactly known; but it is pronounced as we have written\nit, and spelt in that fashion by sporting gentlemen when writing to\neach other.\n\nOur readers may be told in confidence that up to a very late date\nMr. Neefit lived in the rooms over his shop. This is certainly not\nthe thing for a prosperous tradesman to do. Indeed, if a tradesman\nbe known not to have a private residence, he will hardly become\nprosperous. But Neefit had been a cautious man, and till two years\nbefore the commencement of our story, he had actually lived in\nConduit Street,--working hard, however, to keep his residence a deep\nsecret from his customers at large. Now he was the proud possessor of\na villa residence at Hendon, two miles out in the country beyond the\nSwiss Cottage; and all his customers knew that he was never to be\nfound before 9.30 A.M., or after 5.15 P.M.\n\nAs we have said, Mr. Neefit had his troubles, and one of his great\ntroubles was our young friend, Ralph Newton. Ralph Newton was a\nhunting man, with a stud of horses,--never less than four, and\nsometimes running up to seven and eight,--always standing at the\nMoonbeam, at Barnfield. All men know that Barnfield is in the middle\nof the B. B. Hunt,--the two initials standing for those two sporting\ncounties, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire. Now, Mr. Neefit had a very\nlarge connexion in the B. B., and, though he never was on horseback\nin his life, subscribed twenty-five pounds a year to the pack. Mr.\nRalph Newton had long favoured him with his custom; but, we are sorry\nto say, Mr. Ralph Newton had become a thorn in the flesh to many a\ntradesman in these days. It was not that he never paid. He did pay\nsomething; but as he ordered more than he paid, the sum-total against\nhim was always an increasing figure. But then he was a most engaging,\ncivil-spoken young man, whose order it was almost impossible to\ndecline. It was known, moreover, that his prospects were so good!\nNevertheless, it is not pleasant for a breeches-maker to see the\nsecond hundred pound accumulating on his books for leather breeches\nfor one gentleman. \"What does he do with 'em?\" old Neefit would\nsay to himself; but he didn't dare to ask any such question of\nMr. Newton. It isn't for a tradesman to complain that a gentleman\nconsumes too many of his articles. Things, however, went so far that\nMr. Neefit found it to be incumbent on him to make special inquiry\nabout those prospects. Things had gone very far indeed,--for Ralph\nNewton appeared one summer evening at the villa at Hendon, and\nabsolutely asked the breeches-maker to lend him a hundred pounds!\nBefore he left he had taken tea with Mr. and Mrs. and Miss Neefit\non the lawn, and had received almost a promise that the loan should\nbe forthcoming if he would call in Conduit Street on the following\nmorning. That had been early in May, and Ralph Newton had called,\nand, though there had been difficulties, he had received the money\nbefore three days had passed.\n\nMr. Neefit was a stout little man, with a bald head and somewhat\nprotrusive eyes, whose manners to his customers contained a\ncombination of dictatorial assurance and subservience, which he had\nfound to be efficacious in his peculiar business. On general subjects\nhe would rub his hands, and bow his head, and agree most humbly with\nevery word that was uttered. In the same day he would be a Radical\nand a Conservative, devoted to the Church and a scoffer at parsons,\nanimated on behalf of staghounds and a loud censurer of aught in the\nway of hunting other than the orthodox fox. On all trivial outside\nsubjects he considered it to be his duty as a tradesman simply to\ningratiate himself; but in a matter of breeches he gave way to no\nman, let his custom be what it might. He knew his business, and was\nnot going to be told by any man whether the garments which he made\ndid or did not fit. It was the duty of a gentleman to come and\nallow him to see them on while still in a half-embryo condition. If\ngentlemen did their duty, he was sure that he could do his. He would\ntake back anything that was not approved without a murmur;--but after\nthat he must decline further transactions. It was, moreover, quite\nunderstood that to complain of his materials was so to insult him\nthat he would condescend to make no civil reply. An elderly gentleman\nfrom Essex once told him that his buttons were given to breaking.\n\"If you have your breeches,--washed,--by an old woman,--in the\ncountry,\"--said Mr. Neefit, very slowly, looking into the elderly\ngentleman's face, \"and then run through the mangle,--the buttons will\nbreak.\" The elderly gentleman never dared even to enter the shop\nagain.\n\nMr. Neefit was perhaps somewhat over-imperious in matters relating to\nhis own business; but, in excuse for him, it must be stated that he\nwas, in truth, an honest tradesman;--he was honest at least so far,\nthat he did make his breeches as well as he knew how. He had made up\nhis mind that the best way to make his fortune was to send out good\narticles,--and he did his best. Whether or no he was honest in adding\non that additional half guinea to the price because he found that\nthe men with whom he dealt were fools enough to be attracted by a\nhigh price, shall be left to advanced moralists to decide. In that\nuniversal agreement with diverse opinions there must, we fear, have\nbeen something of dishonesty. But he made the best of breeches, put\nno shoddy or cheap stitching into them, and was, upon the whole, an\nhonest tradesman.\n\nFrom 9.30 to 5.15 were Mr. Neefit's hours; but it had come to be\nunderstood by those who knew the establishment well, that from\nhalf-past twelve to half-past one the master was always absent. The\nyoung man who sat at the high desk, and seemed to spend all his time\nin contemplating the bad debts in the ledger, would tell gentlemen\nwho called up to one that Mr. Neefit was in the City. After one it\nwas always said that Mr. Neefit was lunching at the Restaurong. The\ntruth was that Mr. Neefit always dined in the middle of the day at a\npublic-house round the corner, having a chop and a \"follow chop,\" a\npint of beer, a penny newspaper and a pipe. When the villa at Hendon\nhad been first taken Mrs. Neefit had started late dinners; but that\nvigilant and intelligent lady had soon perceived that this simply\nmeant, in regard to her husband, two dinners a day,--and apoplexy.\nShe had, therefore, returned to the old ways,--an early dinner for\nherself and daughter, and a little bit of supper at night. Now,\none day in June,--that very Saturday on which Sir Thomas Underwood\nbrought his niece home to Fulham, the day after that wicked kiss on\nthe lawn at Fulham, Ralph Newton walked into Neefit's shop during the\nhour of Mr. Neefit's absence, and ordered,--three pair of breeches.\nHerr \"Bawwah,\" the cutter, who never left his board during the day\nfor more than five minutes at a time, remained, as was his custom,\nmute and apparently inattentive; but the foreman came down from his\nperch and took the order. Mr. Neefit was out, unfortunately;--in the\nCity. Ralph Newton remarked that his measure was not in the least\naltered, gave his order, and went out.\n\n\"Three pair?--leather?\" asked Mr. Neefit, when he returned, raising\nhis eyebrows, and clearly showing that the moment was not one of\nunmixed delight.\n\n\"Two leather;--one cord,\" said the foreman. \"He had four pair last\nyear,\" said Mr. Neefit, in a tone so piteous that it might almost\nhave been thought that he was going to weep.\n\n\"One hundred and eighty-nine pounds, fourteen shillings, and nine\npence was the Christmas figure,\" said the foreman, turning back to a\nleaf in the book, which he found without any difficulty. Mr. Neefit\ntook himself to the examination of certain completed articles which\nadorned his shop, as though he were anxious to banish from his\nmind so painful a subject. \"Is he to 'ave 'em, Mr. Neefit?\" asked\nthe foreman. The master was still silent, and still fingered the\nmaterials which his very soul loved. \"He must 'ave a matter of twenty\npair by him,--unless he sells 'em,\" said the suspicious foreman.\n\n\"He don't sell 'em,\" said Mr. Neefit. \"He ain't one of that sort. You\ncan put 'em in hand, Waddle.\"\n\n\"Very well, Mr. Neefit. I only thought I'd mention it. It looked\nqueer like, his coming just when you was out.\"\n\n\"I don't see anything queer in it. He ain't one of that sort. Do\nyou go on.\" Mr. Waddle knew nothing of the hundred pounds, nor did\nhe know that Ralph Newton had,--twice drank tea at Hendon. On both\noccasions Mrs. Neefit had declared that if ever she saw a gentleman,\nMr. Newton was a gentleman; and Miss Neefit, though her words had\nbeen very few, had evidently approved of Mr. Newton's manners. Now\nMiss Neefit was a beauty and an heiress.\n\nMr. Waddle had hardly been silenced, and had just retired with\nmelancholy diligence amidst the records of unsatisfactory commercial\ntransactions, before Ralph Newton again entered the shop. He shook\nhands with Mr. Neefit,--as was the practice with many favourite\ncustomers,--and immediately went to work in regard to his new order,\nas though every Christmas and every Midsummer saw an account closed\non his behalf in Mr. Neefit's books. \"I did say just now, when I\nfound you were out, that last year's lines would do; but it may be,\nyou know, that I'm running a little to flesh.\"\n\n\"We can't be too particular, Mr. Newton,\" said the master.\n\n\"It's all for your sake that I come,\" said the young sportsman,\nwalking into the little room, while Mr. Neefit followed with his\nscraps of paper and tapes, and Waddle followed him to write down the\nfigures. \"I don't care much how they look myself.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Newton!\"\n\n\"I shouldn't like 'em to wrinkle inside the knee, you know.\"\n\n\"That isn't likely with us, I hope, Mr. Newton.\"\n\n\"And I own I do like to be able to get into them.\"\n\n\"We don't give much trouble in that way, Mr. Newton.\"\n\n\"But the fact is I have such trust in you and the silent gentleman\nout there, that I believe you would fit me for the next twenty years,\nthough you were never to see me.\"\n\n\"Oh, thank you, Mr. Newton,--2, 4, and 1\/8th, Waddle. I think Mr.\nNewton is a little stouter. But, perhaps, you may work that off\nbefore November, Mr. Newton. Thank you, Mr. Newton;--I think that'll\ndo. You'll find we shan't be far wrong. Three pair, Mr. Newton?\"\n\n\"Yes;--I think three pair will see me through next season. I don't\nsuppose I shall hunt above four days, and I have some by me.\"\n\nSome by him! There must be drawers full of them,--presses full of\nthem, chests full of them! Waddle, the melancholy and suspicious\nWaddle, was sure that their customer was playing them false,--raising\nmoney on the garments as soon as they were sent to him; but he did\nnot dare to say anything of this after the snubbing which he had\nalready received. If old Neefit chose to be done by a dishonest young\nman it was nothing to him. But in truth Waddle did not understand men\nas well as did his master;--and then he knew nothing of his master's\nambitious hopes.\n\n\"The bishops came out very strong last night;--didn't they?\" said\nRalph, in the outer shop.\n\n\"Very strong, indeed, Mr. Newton;--very strong.\"\n\n\"But, after all, they're nothing but a pack of old women.\"\n\n\"That's about what they are, Mr. Newton.\"\n\n\"Not but what we must have a Church, I suppose.\"\n\n\"We should do very badly without a Church, Mr. Newton. At least that\nis my opinion.\" Then Ralph left the shop, and the breeches-maker\nbowed him out of the door.\n\n\"Fifty thousand pounds!\" said Ralph Newton to himself, as he walked\ninto Bond Street and down to his club. When a man is really rich\nrumour always increases his money,--and rumour had doubled the\nfortune which Mr. Neefit had already amassed. \"That means two\nthousand a year; and the girl herself is so pretty, that upon my\nhonour I don't know which is the prettier,--she or Clary. But fancy\nold Neefit for one's father-in-law! Everybody is doing it now; but I\ndon't think I'd do it for ten times the money. The fact is, one has\ngot to get used to these things, and I am not used to it yet. I soon\nshall be,--or to something worse.\" Such was the nature of Ralph's\nthoughts as he walked away from Mr. Neefit's house to his club.\n\nMr. Neefit, as he went home, had his speculations also. In making\nbreeches he was perfect, and in putting together money he had proved\nhimself to be an adept. But as to the use of his money, he was quite\nas much at a loss as he would have been had he tried to wear the\ngarments for which he measured his customers so successfully. He\nhad almost realised the truth that from that money he himself could\nextract, for himself, but little delight beyond that which arose\nsimply from the possession. Holidays destroyed him. Even a day\nat home at Hendon, other than Sunday, was almost more than he\ncould endure. The fruition of life to him was in the completing of\nbreeches, and its charm in a mutton-chop and a pipe of tobacco. He\nhad tried idleness, and was wise enough to know almost at the first\ntrial that idleness would not suit him. He had made one mistake in\nlife which was irreparable. He had migrated from Conduit Street to a\ncold, comfortless box of a house at a place in which, in order that\nhis respectability might be maintained, he was not allowed to show\nhis face in a public-house. This was very bad, but he would not make\nbad worse by giving up so much of Conduit Street as was still left to\nhim. He would stick to the shop. But what would he do with his money?\nHe had but one daughter. Thinking of this, day after day, month after\nmonth, year after year, he came slowly to the conclusion that it was\nhis duty to make his daughter a lady. He must find some gentleman\nwho would marry her, and then would give that gentleman all his\nmoney,--knowing as he did so that the gentleman would probably never\nspeak to him again. And to this conclusion he came with no bitterness\nof feeling, with no sense of disappointment that to such an end must\ncome the exertions of his laborious and successful life. There was\nnothing else for him to do. He could not be a gentleman himself. It\nseemed to be no more within his reach than it is for the gentleman to\nbe an angel. He did not desire it. He would not have enjoyed it. He\nhad that sort of sense which makes a man know so thoroughly his own\nlimits that he has no regret at not passing them. But yet in his eyes\na gentleman was so grand a thing,--a being so infinitely superior to\nhimself,--that, loving his daughter above anything else, he did think\nthat he could die happy if he could see her married into a station\nso exalted. There was a humility in this as regarded himself and an\naffection for his child which were admirable.\n\nThe reader will think that he might at any rate have done better than\nto pitch upon such a one as Ralph Newton; but then the reader hardly\nknows Ralph Newton as yet, and cannot at all realise the difficulty\nwhich poor Mr. Neefit experienced in coming across any gentleman\nin such a fashion as to be able to commence his operations. It is\nhardly open to a tradesman to ask a young man home to his house\nwhen measuring him from the hip to the knee. Neefit had heard of\nmany cases in which gentlemen of money had married the daughters of\ncommercial men, and he knew that the thing was to be done. Money,\nwhich spent in other directions seemed to be nearly useless to him,\nmight be used beneficially in this way. But how was he to set about\nit? Polly Neefit was as pretty a girl as you shall wish to see,\nand he knew that she was pretty. But, if he didn't take care, the\ngood-looking young gasfitter, next door to him down at Hendon, would\nhave his Polly before he knew where he was. Or, worse still, as\nhe thought, there was that mad son of his old friend Moggs, the\nbootmaker, Ontario Moggs as he had been christened by a Canadian\ngodfather, with whom Polly had condescended already to hold something\nof a flirtation. He could not advertise for a genteel lover. What\ncould he do?\n\nThen Ralph Newton made his way down to the Hendon villa,--asking for\nmoney. What should have induced Mr. Newton to come to him for money\nhe could not guess;--but he did know that, of all the young men who\ncame into his back shop to be measured, there was no one whose looks\nand manners and cheery voice had created so strong a feeling of\npleasantness as had those of Mr. Ralph Newton. Mr. Neefit could not\nanalyse it, but there was a kind of sunshine about the young man\nwhich would have made him very unwilling to press hard for payment,\nor to stop the supply of breeches. He had taken a liking to Ralph,\nand found himself thinking about the young man in his journeys\nbetween Hendon and Conduit Street. Was not this the sort of gentleman\nthat would suit his daughter? Neefit wanted no one to tell him that\nRalph Newton was a gentleman,--what he meant by a gentleman,--and\nthat Wallop the stockbroker was not. Wallop the stockbroker spoke\nof himself as though he was a very fine fellow indeed; but to the\nthinking of Mr. Neefit, Ontario Moggs was more like a gentleman than\nMr. Wallop. He had feared much as to his daughter, both in reference\nto the handsome gasfitter and to Ontario Moggs, but since that second\ntea-drinking he had hoped that his daughter's eyes were opened.\n\nHe had made inquiry about Ralph Newton, and had found that the young\nman was undoubtedly heir to a handsome estate in Hampshire,--a place\ncalled Newton Priory, with a parish of Newton Peele, and lodges, and\na gamekeeper, and a park. He knew from of old that Ralph's uncle\nwould have nothing to do with his nephew's debts; but he learned now\nas a certainty that the uncle could not disinherit his nephew. And\nthe debts did not seem to be very high;--and Ralph had come into some\nproperty from his father. Upon the whole, though of course there must\nbe a sacrifice of money at first, Neefit thought that he saw his way.\nMr. Newton, too, had been very civil to his girl,--not simply making\nto her foolish flattering little speeches, but treating her,--so\nthought Neefit,--exactly as a high-bred gentleman would treat the\nlady of his thoughts. It was a high ambition; but Neefit thought that\nthere might possibly be a way to success.\n\nMrs. Neefit had been a good helpmate to her husband,--having worked\nhard for him when hard work on her part was needed,--but was not\naltogether so happy in her disposition as her lord. He desired to\nshine only in his daughter,--and as a tradesman. She was troubled\nby the more difficult ambition of desiring to shine in her own\nperson. It was she who had insisted on migrating to Hendon, and\nwho had demanded also the establishment of a one-horse carriage.\nThe one-horse carriage was no delight to Neefit, and hardly gave\nsatisfaction to his wife after the first three months. To be driven\nalong the same roads, day after day, at the rate of six miles an\nhour, though it may afford fresh air, is not an exciting amusement.\nMrs. Neefit was not given to reading, and was debarred by a sense of\npropriety from making those beef-steak puddings for which, within her\nown small household, she had once been so famous. Hendon she found\ndull; and, though Hendon had been her own choice, she could not keep\nherself from complaining of its dulness to her husband. But she\nalways told him that the fault lay with him. He ought to content\nhimself with going to town four times a week, and take a six weeks'\nholiday in the autumn. That was the recognised mode of life with\ngentlemen who had made their fortunes in trade. Then she tried to\nmake him believe that constant seclusion in Conduit Street was bad\nfor his liver. But above all things he ought to give up measuring his\nown customers with his own hands. None of their genteel neighbours\nwould call upon his wife and daughter as long as he did that. But\nMr. Neefit was a man within whose bosom gallantry had its limits.\nHe had given his wife a house at Hendon, and was contented to take\nthat odious journey backwards and forwards six days a week to oblige\nher. But when she told him not to measure his own customers, \"he cut\nup rough\" as Polly called it. \"You be blowed,\" he said to the wife\nof his bosom. He had said it before, and she bore it with majestic\nequanimity.\n\nPolly Neefit was, as we have said, as pretty a girl as you shall wish\nto see, in spite of a nose that was almost a pug nose, and a mouth\nthat was a little large. I think, however, that she was perhaps\nprettier at seventeen, when she would run up and down Conduit Street\non messages for her father,--who was not as yet aware that she had\nceased to be a child,--than she became afterwards at Hendon, when she\nwas twenty. In those early days her glossy black hair hung down her\nface in curls. Now, she had a thing on the back of her head, and her\nhair was manoeuvred after the usual fashion. But her laughing dark\neyes were full of good-humour, and looked as though they could be\nfilled also with feeling. Her complexion was perfect,--perfect at\ntwenty, though from its nature it would be apt to be fixed, and\nperhaps rough and coarse at thirty. But at twenty it was perfect. It\nwas as is the colour of a half-blown rose, in which the variations\nfrom white to pink, and almost to red, are so gradual and soft as\nto have no limits. And then with her there was a charm beyond that\nof the rose, for the hues would ever be changing. As she spoke or\nlaughed, or became serious or sat thoughtless, or pored over her\nnovel, the tint of her cheek and neck would change as this or that\nemotion, be it ever so slight, played upon the current of her\nblood. She was tall, and well made,--perhaps almost robust. She was\ngood-humoured, somewhat given to frank coquetry, and certainly fond\nof young men. She had sense enough not to despise her father, and was\ngood enough to endeavour to make life bearable to her mother. She was\nclever, too, in her way, and could say sprightly things. She read\nnovels, and loved a love story. She meant herself to have a grand\npassion some day, but did not quite sympathise with her father's\nviews about gentlemen. Not that these views were discussed between\nthem, but each was gradually learning the mind of the other. It\nwas very pleasant to Polly Neefit to waltz with the good-looking\ngasfitter;--and indeed to waltz with any man was a pleasure to Polly,\nfor dancing was her Paradise upon earth. And she liked talking to\nOntario Moggs, who was a clever man and had a great deal to say about\nmany things. She believed that Ontario Moggs was dying for her love,\nbut she had by no means made up her mind that Ontario was to be the\nhero of the great passion. The great passion was quite a necessity\nfor her. She must have her romance. But Polly was aware that a great\npassion ought to be made to lead to a snug house, half a dozen\nchildren, and a proper, church-going, roast-mutton, duty-doing manner\nof life. Now Ontario Moggs had very wild ideas. As for the gasfitter\nhe danced well and was good-looking, but he had very little to say\nfor himself. When Polly saw Ralph Newton,--especially when he sat out\non the lawn with them and smoked cigars on his second coming,--she\nthought him very nice. She had no idea of being patronised by any\none, and she was afraid of persons whom she called \"stuck-up\" ladies\nand gentlemen. But Mr. Newton had not patronised her, and she had\nacknowledged that he was--very nice. Such as she was, she was the\nidol of her father's heart and the apple of his eye. If she had asked\nhim to give up measuring, he might have yielded. But then his Polly\nwas too wise for that.\n\nWe must say a word more of Mrs. Neefit, and then we shall hope that\nour readers will know the family. She had been the daughter of a\nbreeches-maker, to whom Neefit had originally been apprenticed,--and\ntherefore regarded herself as the maker of the family. But in truth\nthe business, such as it was now in its glory, had been constructed\nby her husband, and her own fortune had been very small. She was a\nstout, round-faced, healthy, meaningless woman, in whom ill-humour\nwould not have developed itself unless idleness,--that root of all\nevil,--had fallen in her way. As it was, in the present condition of\ntheir lives, she did inflict much discomfort on poor Mr. Neefit. Had\nhe been ill, she would have nursed him with all her care. Had he\ndied, she would have mourned for him as the best of husbands. Had he\nbeen three parts ruined in trade, she would have gone back to Conduit\nStreet and made beef-steak puddings almost without a murmur. She was\nvery anxious for his Sunday dinner,--and would have considered it to\nbe a sin to be without a bit of something nice for his supper. She\ntook care that he always wore flannel, and would never let him stay\naway from church,--lest worse should befall him. But she couldn't let\nhim be quiet. What else was there left for her to do but to nag him?\nPolly, who was with her during the long hours of the day, would not\nbe nagged. \"Now, mamma!\" she'd say with a tone of authority that\nalmost overcame mamma. And if mamma was very cross, Polly would\nescape. But during the long hours of the night the breeches-maker\ncould not escape;--and in minor matters the authority lay with her.\nIt was only when great matters were touched that Mr. Neefit would\nrise in his wrath and desire his wife \"to be blowed.\"\n\nNo doubt Mrs. Neefit was an unhappy woman,--more unfortunate as a\nwoman than was her husband as a man. The villa at Hendon had been\nheavy upon him, but it had been doubly heavy upon her. He could\nemploy himself. The legs of his customers, to him, were a blessed\nresource. But she had no resource. The indefinite idea which she had\nformed of what life would be in a pretty villa residence had been\nproved to be utterly fallacious,--though she had never acknowledged\nthe fallacy either to husband or daughter. That one-horse carriage\nin which she was dragged about, was almost as odious to her as her\nown drawing-room. That had become so horrible that it was rarely\nused;--but even the dining-room was very bad. What would she do\nthere, poor woman? What was there left for her to do at all in this\nworld,--except to nag at her husband?\n\nNevertheless all who knew anything about the Neefits said that they\nwere very respectable people, and had done very well in the world.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nMRS. NEEFIT'S LITTLE DINNER.\n\n\nOn the Sunday morning following that remarkable Saturday on which\nMiss Bonner had been taken to her new home and Ralph Newton had\nordered three pair of breeches, Mr. Neefit made a very ambitious\nproposition. \"My dear, I think I'll ask that young man to come\nand have a bit of dinner here next Sunday.\" This was said after\nbreakfast, as Mr. Neefit was being made smart in his church-going\ncoat and his Sunday hat, which were kept together in Mrs. Neefit's\nbig press.\n\n\"Which young man?\" Now Mrs. Neefit when she asked the question knew\nvery well that Mr. Newton was the young man to whom hospitality was\nto be offered. Ontario Moggs was her favourite; but Mr. Neefit would\nnot have dreamed of asking Ontario Moggs to dinner.\n\n\"Mr. Newton, my dear,\" said Mr. Neefit, with his head stuck sharply\nup, while his wife tied a bow in his Sunday neckhandkerchief.\n\n\"Why should us ask him? He won't think nothing of his vittels when he\ngets 'em. He'd only turn up his nose; and as for Polly, what's the\nuse of making her more saucy than she is? I don't want such as him\nhere, Neefit;--that I don't. Stuck-up young men like him had better\nstay away from Alexandrina Cottage,\"--that was the name of the happy\nhome at Hendon. \"I'm sure our Polly won't be the better for having\nthe likes of him here.\"\n\nNothing more was said on the subject till after the return of the\nfamily from church; but, during the sermon Mr. Neefit had had an\nopportunity of thinking the subject over, and had resolved that this\nwas a matter in which it behoved him to be master. How was this\nmarriage to be brought about if the young people were not allowed to\nsee each other? Of course he might fail. He knew that. Very probably\nMr. Newton might not accept the invitation,--might never show himself\nagain at Alexandrina Cottage; but unless an effort was made there\ncould not be success. \"I don't see why he shouldn't eat a bit of\ndinner here,\" said Mr. Neefit, as soon as his pipe was lighted after\ntheir early dinner. \"It ain't anything out of the way, as I know of.\"\n\n\"You're thinking of Polly, Neefit?\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't I be thinking of her? There ain't no more of 'em.\nWhat's the use of working for her, if one don't think of her?\"\n\n\"It won't do no good, Neefit. If we had things here as we might have\n'em, indeed--!\"\n\n\"What's amiss?\"\n\n\"With nothing to drink out of, only common wine-glasses; and it's my\nbelief Jemima 'd never cook a dinner as he'd look at. I know what\nthey are,--them sort of young men. They're worse than a dozen ladies\nwhen you come to vittels.\"\n\nNevertheless Mr. Neefit resolved upon having his own way, and it was\nsettled that Ralph Newton should be asked to come and eat a bit of\ndinner on next Sunday. Then there arose a difficulty as to the mode\nof asking him. Neefit himself felt that it would be altogether out of\nhis line to indite an invitation. In days gone by, before he kept a\nclerk for the purpose, he had written very many letters to gentlemen,\nusing various strains of pressure as he called their attention to the\nlittle outstanding accounts which stood on his books and were thorns\nin his flesh. But of the writing of such letters as this now intended\nto be written he had no experience. As for Mrs. Neefit, her skill in\nthis respect was less even than that of her husband. She could write,\nno doubt. On very rare occasions she would make some expression of\nher thoughts with pen and ink to Polly, when she and Polly were\napart. But no one else ever saw how slight was her proficiency in\nthis direction. But Polly was always writing. Polly's pothooks, as\nher father called them, were pictures in her father's eyes. She\ncould dash off straight lines of writing,--line after line,--with\nsharp-pointed angles and long-tailed letters, in a manner which made\nher father proud of the money which he had spent on her education.\nSo Polly was told to write the letter, and after many expressions of\nsurprise, Polly wrote the letter that evening. \"Mr. and Mrs. Neefit's\ncompliments to Mr. Newton, and hope he will do them the honour to\ndine with them on Sunday next at five o'clock. Alexandrina Cottage,\nSunday.\"\n\n\"Say five sharp,\" said the breeches-maker.\n\n\"No, father, I won't,--say anything about sharp.\"\n\n\"Why not, Polly?\"\n\n\"It wouldn't look pretty. I don't suppose he'll come, and I'm sure I\ndon't know why you should ask him. Dear me, I'm certain he'll know\nthat I wrote it. What will he think?\"\n\n\"He'll think it comes from as pretty a young woman as he ever clapped\nhis eyes on,\" said Mr. Neefit, who was not at all reticent in the\nmatter of compliments to his daughter.\n\n\"Laws, Neefit, how you do spoil the girl!\" said his wife.\n\n\"He has about finished spoiling me now, mamma; so it don't much\nsignify. You always did spoil me;--didn't you, father?\" Then Polly\nkissed Mr. Neefit's bald head; and Mr. Neefit, as he sat in the\ncentre of his lawn, with his girdle loose around him, a glass of gin\nand water by his side, and a pipe in his mouth, felt that in truth\nthere was something left in the world worth living for. But a thought\ncame across his mind,--\"If that chap comes I shan't be as comfortable\nnext Sunday.\" And then there was another thought,--\"If he takes my\nPolly away from me, I don't know as I shall ever be comfortable\nagain.\" But still he did not hesitate or repent. Of course his Polly\nmust have a husband.\n\nThen a dreadful proposition was made by Mrs. Neefit. \"Why not have\nMoggs too?\"\n\n\"Oh, mamma!\"\n\n\"Are you going to turn your nose up at Ontario Moggs, Miss Pride?\"\n\n\"I don't turn my nose up at him. I'm very fond of Mr. Moggs. I think\nhe's the best fun going. But I am sure that if Mr. Newton does come,\nhe'd rather not have Mr. Moggs here too.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't do at all,\" said Mr. Neefit. \"Ontario is all very well,\nbut Mr. Newton and he wouldn't suit.\"\n\nMrs. Neefit was snubbed, and went to sleep on the sofa for the rest\nof the afternoon,--intending, no doubt, to let Mr. Neefit have the\nbenefit of her feelings as soon as they two should be alone together.\n\nOur friend Ralph received the note, and accepted the invitation. He\ntold himself that it was a lark. As the reader knows, he had already\ndecided that he would not sell himself even to so pretty a girl as\nPolly Neefit for any amount of money; but not the less might it be\nagreeable to him to pass a Sunday afternoon in her company.\n\nRalph Newton at this time occupied very comfortable bachelor's rooms\nin a small street close to St. James's Palace. He had now held these\nfor the last two years, and had contrived to make his friends about\ntown know that here was his home. He had declined to go into the army\nhimself when he was quite young,--or rather had agreed not to go into\nthe army, on condition that he should not be pressed as to any other\nprofession. He lived, however, very much with military friends, many\nof whom found it convenient occasionally to breakfast with him, or\nto smoke a pipe in his chambers. He never did any work, and lived\na useless, butterfly life,--only with this difference from other\nbutterflies, that he was expected to pay for his wings.\n\nIn that matter of payment was the great difficulty of Ralph Newton's\nlife. He had been started at nineteen with an allowance of \u00c2\u00a3250 per\nannum. When he was twenty-one he inherited a fortune from his father\nof more than double that amount; and as he was the undoubted heir to\na property of \u00c2\u00a37,000 a year, it may be said of him that he was born\nwith a golden spoon. But he had got into debt before he was twenty,\nand had never got out of it. The quarrel with his uncle was an old\naffair, arranged for him by his father before he knew how to quarrel\non his own score, and therefore we need say no more about that at\npresent. But his uncle would not pay a shilling for him, and would\nhave quarrelled also with his other nephew, the clergyman, had he\nknown that the younger brother assisted the elder. But up to the\nmoment of which we are writing, the iron of debt had not as yet\nabsolutely entered into the soul of this young man. He had, in\nhis need, just borrowed \u00c2\u00a3100 from his breeches-maker; and this\nperhaps was not the first time that he had gone to a tradesman for\nassistance. But hitherto money had been forthcoming, creditors had\nbeen indulgent, and at this moment he possessed four horses which\nwere eating their heads off at the Moonbeam, at Barnfield.\n\nAt five o'clock, with sufficient sharpness, Ralph Newton got out\nof a Hansom cab at the door of Alexandrina Cottage. \"He's cum in a\n'Ansom,\" said Mrs. Neefit, looking over the blind of the drawing-room\nwindow. \"That's three-and-six,\" said Neefit, with a sigh. \"You\ndidn't think he was going to walk, father?\" said Polly. \"There's the\nUnderground within two miles, if the Midland didn't suit,\" said Mr.\nNeefit. \"Nonsense, father. Of course he'd come in a cab!\" said Polly.\nMrs. Neefit was not able to add the stinging remark with which her\ntongue was laden, as Ralph Newton was already in the house. She\nsmoothed her apron, crossed her hands, and uttered a deep sigh. There\ncould be no more going down into the kitchen now to see whether\nthe salmon was boiled, or to provide for the proper dishing of the\nlamb. \"This is quite condescending of you, Mr. Newton,\" said the\nbreeches-maker, hardly daring to shake hands with his guest,--though\nin his shop he was always free enough with his customers in this\nmatter. Polly looked as though she thought there was no condescension\nwhatever, held up her head, and laughed and joked, and asked some\nquestions about the German at the shop, whom she declared she was\nnever allowed to see now, and whose voice she swore she had never\nheard. \"Is he dumb, Mr. Newton? Father never will tell me anything\nabout him. You must know.\"\n\n\"Laws, Polly, what does it matter?\" said Mrs. Neefit. And they were\nthe only words she had spoken. Polly, from the first, had resolved\nthat she would own to the shop. If Mr. Newton came to see her, he\nshould come to see a girl who was not ashamed to speak of herself as\nthe daughter of a breeches-maker.\n\n\"He don't talk much, does he, Mr. Newton?\" said Mr. Neefit, laughing\nmerrily.\n\n\"Do tell me one thing,\" said Ralph. \"I know it's a secret, but I'll\npromise not to tell it. What is his real name?\"\n\n\"This isn't fair,\" said Mr. Neefit, greatly delighted. \"All trades\nhave their secrets. Come, come, Mr. Newton!\"\n\n\"I know his name,\" said Polly.\n\n\"Do tell me,\" said Ralph, coming close to her, as though he might\nhear it in a whisper.\n\n\"Mr. Neefit, I wish you wouldn't talk about such things here,\" said\nthe offended matron. \"But now here's dinner.\" She was going to take\nher guest's arm, but Mr. Neefit arranged it otherwise.\n\n\"The old uns and the young uns;--that's the way to pair them,\" said\nMr. Neefit,--understanding nature better than he did precedence; and\nso they walked into the next room. Mrs. Neefit was not quite sure\nwhether her husband had or had not done something improper. She had\nher doubts, and they made her uncomfortable.\n\nThe dinner went off very well. Neefit told how he had gone himself to\nthe fishmonger's for that bit of salmon, how troubled his wife had\nbeen in mind about the lamb, and how Polly had made the salad. \"And\nI'll tell you what I did, Mr. Newton; I brought down that bottle of\nchampagne in my pocket myself;--gave six bob for it at Palmer's, in\nBond Street. My wife says we ain't got glasses fit to drink it out\nof.\"\n\n\"You needn't tell Mr. Newton all that.\"\n\n\"Mr. Newton, what I am I ain't ashamed on, nor yet what I does. Let\nme have the honour of drinking a glass of wine with you, Mr. Newton.\nYou see us just as we are. I wish it was better, but it couldn't be\nwelcomer. Your health, Mr. Newton.\"\n\nThere are many men,--and men, too, not of a bad sort,--who in\nsuch circumstances cannot make themselves pleasant. Grant the\ncircumstances, with all the desire to make the best of them,--and\nthese men cannot be otherwise than stiff, disagreeable, and uneasy.\nBut then, again, there are men who in almost any position can carry\nthemselves as though they were to the manner born. Ralph Newton was\none of the latter. He was not accustomed to dine with the tradesmen\nwho supplied him with goods, and had probably never before\nencountered such a host as Mr. Neefit;--but he went through the\ndinner with perfect ease and satisfaction, and before the pies and\njellies had been consumed, had won the heart of even Mrs. Neefit.\n\"Laws, Mr. Newton,\" she said, \"what can you know about custards?\"\nThen Ralph Newton offered to come and make custards against her in\nher own kitchen,--providing he might have Polly to help him. \"But\nyou'd want the back kitchen to yourselves, I'm thinking,\" said Mr.\nNeefit, in high good-humour.\n\nMr. Neefit certainly was not a delicate man. As soon as dinner was\nover, and the two ladies had eaten their strawberries and cream, he\nsuggested that the port wine should be taken out into the garden. In\nthe farther corner of Mr. Neefit's grounds, at a distance of about\ntwenty yards from the house, was a little recess called \"the arbour,\"\nadmonitory of earwigs, and without much pretension to comfort.\nIt might hold three persons, but on this occasion Mr. Neefit was\nminded that two only should enjoy the retreat. Polly carried out the\ndecanter and glasses, but did not presume to stay there for a moment.\nShe followed her mother into the gorgeous drawing-room, where Mrs.\nNeefit at once went to sleep, while her daughter consoled herself\nwith a novel. Mr. Neefit, as we have said, was not a delicate man.\n\"That girl 'll have twenty thousand pound, down on the nail, the day\nshe marries the man as I approves of. Fill your glass, Mr. Newton.\nShe will;--and there's no mistake about it. There'll be more money\ntoo, when I'm dead,--and the old woman.\"\n\nIt might be owned that such a speech from the father of a\nmarriageable daughter to a young man who had hardly as yet shown\nhimself to be enamoured, was not delicate. But it may be a question\nwhether it was not sensible. He had made up his mind, and therefore\nwent at once at his object. And unless he did the business in this\nway, what chance was there that it would be done at all? Mr. Newton\ncould not come down to Alexandrina Cottage every other day, or meet\nthe girl elsewhere, as he might do young ladies of fashion. And,\nmoreover, the father knew well enough that were his girl once to tell\nhim that she had set her heart upon the gasfitter, or upon Ontario\nMoggs, he would not have the power to contradict her. He desired that\nshe should become a gentleman's wife; and thinking that this was the\nreadiest way to accomplish his wish, he saw no reason why he should\nnot follow it. When he had spoken, he chucked off his glass of wine,\nand looked into his young friend's face for an answer.\n\n\"He'll be a lucky fellow that gets her,\" said Ralph, beginning\nunconsciously to feel that it might perhaps have been as well for him\nhad he remained in his lodgings on this Sunday.\n\n\"He will be a lucky fellow, Mr. Newton. She's as good as gold. And a\nwell bred 'un too, though I say it as shouldn't. There's not a dirty\ndrop in her. And she's that clever, she can do a'most anything. As\nfor her looks, I'll say nothing about them. You've got eyes in your\nhead. There ain't no mistake there, Mr. Newton; no paint; no Madame\nRachel; no made beautiful for ever! It's human nature what you see\nthere, Mr. Newton.\"\n\n\"I'm quite sure of that.\"\n\n\"And she has the heart of an angel.\" By this time Mr. Neefit\nwas alternately wiping the tears from his eyes, and taking half\nglasses of port wine. \"I know all about you, Mr. Newton. You are a\ngentleman;--that's what you are.\"\n\n\"I hope so.\"\n\n\"And if you don't get the wrong side of the post, you'll come out\nright at last. You'll have a nice property some of these days, but\nyou're just a little short of cash at present.\"\n\n\"That's about true, Mr. Neefit.\"\n\n\"I want nobody to tell me;--I know,\" continued Neefit. \"Now if you\nmake up to her, there she is,--with twenty thousand pounds down. You\nare a gentleman, and I want that girl to be a lady. You can make her\na lady. You can't make her no better than she is. The best man in\nEngland can't do that. But you can make her a lady. I don't know what\nshe'll say, mind; but you can ask her,--if you please. I like you,\nand you can ask her,--if you please. What answer she'll make, that's\nher look out. But you can ask her,--if you please. Perhaps I'm a\nlittle too forrard; but I call that honest. I don't know what you\ncall it. But this I do know;--there ain't so sweet a girl as that\nwithin twenty miles round London.\" Then Mr. Neefit, in his energy,\ndashed his hand down among the glasses on the little rustic table in\nthe arbour.\n\nThe reader may imagine that Ralph Newton was hardly ready with his\nanswer. There are men, no doubt, who in such an emergency would have\nbeen able to damn the breeches-maker's impudence, and to have walked\nat once out of the house. But our young friend felt no inclination to\npunish his host in such fashion as this. He simply remarked that he\nwould think of it, the matter being too grave for immediate decision,\nand that he would join the ladies.\n\n\"Do, Mr. Newton,\" said Mr. Neefit; \"go and join Polly. You'll find\nshe's all I tell you. I'll sit here and have a pipe.\"\n\nRalph did join the ladies; and, finding Mrs. Neefit asleep, he\ninduced Polly to take a walk with him amidst the lanes of Hendon.\nWhen he left Alexandrina Cottage in the evening, Mr. Neefit whispered\na word into his ear at the gate. \"You know my mind. Strike while the\niron's hot. There she is,--just what you see her.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nYOU ARE ONE OF US NOW.\n\n\nThe first week after Mary Bonner's arrival at Popham Villa went by\nwithout much to make it remarkable, except the strangeness arising\nfrom the coming of a stranger. Sir Thomas did stay at home on that\nSunday, but when the time came for going to morning church, shuffled\nout of that disagreeable duty in a manner that was satisfactory\nneither to himself nor his daughters. \"Oh, papa; I thought you would\nhave gone with us!\" said Patience at the last moment.\n\n\"I think not to-day, my dear,\" he said, with that sort of smile which\nbetokens inward uneasiness. Patience reproached him with a look, and\nthen the three girls went off together. Even Patience herself had\noffered to excuse Mary, on the score of fatigue, seasickness, and the\nlike; but Mary altogether declined to be excused. She was neither\nfatigued, she said, nor sick; and of course she would go to church.\nSir Thomas stayed at home, and thought about himself. How could he\ngo to church when he knew that he could neither listen to the sermon\nnor join in the prayers? \"I suppose people do,\" he said to himself;\n\"but I can't. I'd go to church all day long, if I found that it would\nserve me.\"\n\nHe went up to London on the Monday, and returned to the villa to\ndinner. He did the same on the Tuesday. On the Wednesday he remained\nin London. On the Thursday he came home, but dined in town. After\nthat he found himself to be on sufficiently familiar terms with his\nniece to fall back into his old habits of life.\n\nPatience was very slow in speaking to their cousin of her father's\npeculiarities; but Clarissa soon told the tale. \"You'll get to know\npapa soon,\" she said.\n\n\"He has been so kind to me.\"\n\n\"He is very good; but you must know, dear, that we are the most\ndeserted and disconsolate ladies that ever lived out of a poem. Papa\nhas been home now four days together; but that is for your beaux\nyeux. We are here for weeks together without seeing him;--very often\nfor more than a week.\"\n\n\"Where does he go?\"\n\n\"He has a place in London;--such a place! You shall go and see it\nsome day, though he won't thank us a bit for taking you there. He has\nthe queerest old man to wait upon him, and he never sees anybody from\nday to day.\"\n\n\"But what does he do?\"\n\n\"He is writing a book. That is the great secret. He never speaks\nabout it, and does not like to be asked questions. But the truth is,\nhe is the most solitude-loving person in the world. He does find its\ncharms, though Alexander Selkirk never could.\"\n\n\"And does nobody come here to you?\"\n\n\"In the way of taking care of us? Nobody! We have to take care of\nourselves. Of course it is dull. People do come and see us sometimes.\nMiss Spooner, for instance.\"\n\n\"Why should you laugh at poor Miss Spooner?\" asked Patience.\n\n\"I don't laugh at her. We have other friends, you know; but not\nenough to make the house pleasant to you.\" After that, when Patience\nwas not with them, she told something of Ralph Newton and his visits,\nthough she said nothing to her cousin of her own cherished hopes. \"I\nwonder what you'll think of Ralph Newton?\" she said. Ralph Newton's\nname had been mentioned before in Mary's hearing more than once.\n\n\"Why should I think anything particular of Ralph Newton?\"\n\n\"You'll have to think something particular about him as he is a sort\nof child of the house. Papa was his guardian, and he comes here just\nwhen he pleases.\"\n\n\"Who is he, and what is he, and where is he, and why is he?\"\n\n\"He's a gentleman at large who does nothing. That's who he is.\"\n\n\"He thinks ever so much of himself, then?\"\n\n\"No;--he doesn't. And he is nephew to an old squire down in\nHampshire, who won't give him a penny. He oughtn't to want it,\nhowever, because when he came of age he had ever so much money of his\nown. But he does want it,--sometimes. He must have the property when\nhis uncle dies.\"\n\n\"Dear me;--how interesting!\"\n\n\"As for the where he is, and why he is,--he comes here just when it\nsuits him, and because we were almost brought up together. He doesn't\ndine here, and all that kind of thing, because papa is never at home.\nNobody ever does dine here.\"\n\nThen there was a short pause. \"This Mr. Newton isn't a lover then?\"\nasked Miss Bonner.\n\nThere was another pause before Clarissa could answer the question.\n\"No,\" she said; \"no; he isn't a lover. We don't have any lovers at\nPopham Villa.\" \"Only that's not quite true,\" she said, after a pause.\n\"And as you are to live with us just like a sister, I'll tell you\nabout Gregory Newton, Ralph's brother.\" Then she did tell the story\nof the clergyman's love and the clergyman's discomfiture; but she\nsaid not a word of Ralph's declaration and Ralph's great sin on that\nfatal evening. And the way in which she told her story about the one\nbrother altogether disarmed Mary Bonner's suspicion as to the other.\n\nIn truth Clarissa did not know whether it was or was not her\nprivilege to regard Ralph Newton as her lover. He had not been to the\ncottage since that evening; and though the words he had spoken were\nstill sweet in her ears,--so sweet that she could not endure the\nthought of abandoning their sweetness,--still she had a misgiving\nthat they were in some sort rendered nugatory by his great fault. She\nhad forgiven the fault;--looking back at it now over the distance\nof eight or ten days, had forgiven it with all her heart; but still\nthere remained with her an undefined and unpleasant feeling that the\nspoken words, accompanied by a deed so wicked, were absorbed, and,\nas it were, drowned in the wickedness of the deed. What if the words\nas first spoken were only a prelude to the deed,--for, as she well\nremembered, they had been spoken twice,--and if the subsequent words\nwere only an excuse for it! There was a painful idea in her mind that\nsuch might possibly be the case, and that if so, the man could never\nbe forgiven, or at least ought never to be spoken to again. Acting\non this suggestion from within, she absolutely refused to tell her\nfather what had happened when Patience urged her to do so. \"He'll\ncome and see papa himself,--if he means anything,\" said Clary.\nPatience only shook her head. She thought that Sir Thomas should be\ntold at once; but she could not take upon herself to divulge her\nsister's secret, which had been imparted to her in trust.\n\nClarissa was obstinate. She would not tell her father, nor would\nshe say what would be her own answer if her father were to give his\npermission for the match. As to this Patience had not much doubt. She\nsaw that her sister's heart was set upon this lover. She had feared\nit before this late occurrence, and now she could hardly have a\ndoubt. But if Ralph really meant it he would hardly have told her\nthat he loved her, and then not waited for an answer,--not have come\nback for an answer,--not have gone to their father for an answer.\nAnd then, Patience thought, Sir Thomas would never consent to this\nmarriage. Ralph was in debt, and a scapegrace, and quite unfit to\nundertake the management of a wife. Such was the elder sister's\nbelief as to her father's mind. But she could not force upon Clary\nthe necessity of taking any action in the matter. She was not strong\nenough in her position as elder to demand obedience. Clarissa's\ncommunication had been made in confidence; and Patience, though she\nwas unhappy, would not break the trust.\n\nAt last this young Lothario appeared among them again; but, as it\nhappened, he came in company with Sir Thomas. Such a thing had not\nhappened before since the day on which Sir Thomas had given up all\ncharge of his ward's property. But it did so happen now. The two men\nhad met in London, and Sir Thomas had suggested that Ralph should\ncome and be introduced to the new cousin.\n\n\"What are you doing now?\" Sir Thomas had asked.\n\n\"Nothing particular just at present.\"\n\n\"You can get away this evening?\"\n\n\"Yes,--I think I can get away.\" It had been his intention to dine\nat his club with Captain Cox; but as he had dined at the club with\nCaptain Cox on the previous day, the engagement was not felt to be\naltogether binding. \"I can get away for dinner that is, but I've got\nto go out in the evening. It's a bore, but I promised to be at Lady\nMcMarshal's to-night. But if I show there at twelve it will do.\" Thus\nit happened that Sir Thomas and Ralph Newton went down to Popham\nVilla in a cab together.\n\nIt was clear, both to Patience and Clarissa, that he was much struck\nwith the new cousin; but then it was quite out of the question\nthat any man should not be struck with her. Her beauty was of that\nkind,--like the beauty of a picture,--which must strike even if\nit fails to charm. And Mary had a way of exciting attention with\nstrangers, even by her silence. It was hardly intentional, and there\ncertainly was no coquetry in it; but it was the case that she carried\nherself after a fashion which made it impossible for any stranger to\nregard her place in the room as being merely a chair with a young\nlady in it. She would speak hardly a word; but her very lack of\nspeech was eloquent. At the present time she was of course in deep\nmourning, and the contrast between the brilliance of her complexion\nand the dark dress which covered her throat;--between the black\nscarf and the profusion of bright hair which fell upon it, was so\nremarkable as of itself to excite attention. Clarissa, watching\neverything, though, with feminine instinct, seeming to watch nothing,\ncould see that he was amazed. But then she had known that he would be\namazed. And of what matter would be his amazement, if he were true?\nIf, indeed, he were not true,--then, then,--then nothing mattered!\nSuch was the light in which Clary viewed the circumstances around her\nat the present moment.\n\nThe evening did not pass very pleasantly. Ralph was introduced to the\ncousin, and asked some questions about the West Indies. Then there\nwas tea. Ralph was dressed, with a black coat and white cravat, and\nClary could not keep herself from thinking how very much nicer he was\nwith a pipe in his mouth, and his neck bare, drinking soda-water and\nsherry out on the lawn. Ah,--in spite of all that had then happened,\nthat was the sweetest moment in her existence, when he jumped up from\nthe ground and told her that he might do a great deal better than\nmarry the West Indian cousin. She thought now of his very words, and\nsuggested to herself that perhaps he would never say them again.\nNay;--might it not be possible that he would say the very reverse,\nthat he would declare his wish to marry the West Indian cousin. Clary\ncould not conceive but that he might have her should he so wish.\nYoung ladies, when they are in love, are prone to regard their lovers\nas being prizes so valuable as to be coveted by all female comers.\n\nBefore Ralph had taken his leave Sir Thomas took Mary apart to make\nsome communication to her as to her own affairs. Everything was now\nsettled, and Sir Thomas had purchased stock for her with her little\nfortune. \"You have \u00c2\u00a320 2_s._ 4_d._ a year, quite your own,\" he said,\nlaughing;--as he might have done to one of his own girls, had an\nunexpected legacy been left to her.\n\n\"That means that I must be altogether dependent on your charity,\" she\nsaid, looking into his face through her tears.\n\n\"It means nothing of the kind,\" he said, with almost the impetuosity\nof anger. \"There shall be no such cold word as charity between you\nand me. You are one of us now, and of my cup and of my loaf it is\nyour right to partake, as it is the right of those girls there. I\nshall never think of it, or speak of it again.\"\n\n\"But I must think of it, uncle.\"\n\n\"The less the better;--but never use that odious word again between\nyou and me. It is a word for strangers. What is given as I give to\nyou should be taken without even an acknowledgment. My payment is to\nbe your love.\"\n\n\"You shall be paid in full,\" she said as she kissed him. This was\nall very well, but still on his part there was some misgiving,--some\nmisgiving, though no doubt. If he were to die what would become of\nher? He must make a new will,--which in itself was to him a terrible\ntrouble; and he must take something from his own girls in order that\nhe might provide for this new daughter. That question of adopting is\nvery difficult. If a man have no children of his own,--none others\nthat are dependent on him,--he can give all, and there is an end\nof his trouble. But a man feels that he owes his property to his\nchildren; and, so feeling, may he take it from them and give it to\nothers? Had she been in truth his daughter, he would have felt that\nthere was enough for three; but she was not his daughter, and yet he\nwas telling her that she should be to him the same as a child of his\nhouse!\n\nIn the meantime Ralph was out on the lawn with the two sisters, and\nwas as awkward as men always are in such circumstances. When he spoke\nthose words to Clarissa he had in truth no settled purpose in his\nmind. He had always liked her,--loved her after a fashion,--felt\nfor her an affection different to that which he entertained for her\nsister. Nevertheless, most assuredly he had not come down to Fulham\non that evening prepared to make her an offer. He had been there by\nchance, and it had been quite by chance that he found Clarissa alone.\nHe knew that the words had been spoken, and he knew also that he\nhad drawn down her wrath upon his head by his caress. He was man\nenough also to feel that he had no right to believe himself to have\nbeen forgiven, because now, in the presence of others, she did not\nreceive him with a special coldness which would have demanded special\nexplanation. As it was, the three were all cold. Patience half felt\ninclined to go and leave them together. She would have given a finger\noff her hand to make Clary happy;--but would it be right to make\nClary happy in such fashion as this? She had thought at first when\nshe saw her father and Ralph together, that Ralph had spoken of his\nlove to Sir Thomas, and that Sir Thomas had allowed him to come; but\nshe soon perceived that this was not the case: and so they walked\nabout together, each knowing that their intercourse was not as it\nalways had been, and each feeling powerless to resume an appearance\nof composure.\n\n\"I have got to go and be at Lady McMarshal's,\" he said, after having\nsuffered in this way for a quarter of an hour. \"If I did not show\nmyself there her ladyship would think that I had given over all ideas\nof propriety, and that I was a lost sheep past redemption.\"\n\n\"Don't let us keep you if you ought to go,\" said Clary, with dismal\npropriety.\n\n\"I think I'll be off. Good-bye, Patience. The new cousin is radiant\nin beauty. No one can doubt that. But I don't know whether she is\nexactly the sort of girl I admire most. By-the-bye, what do you mean\nto do with her?\"\n\n\"Do with her?\" said Patience. \"She will live here, of course.\"\n\n\"Just settle down as one of the family? Then, no doubt, I shall see\nher again. Good-night, Patience. Good-bye, Clary. I'll just step in\nand make my adieux to Sir Thomas and the beauty.\" This he did;--but\nas he went he pressed Clary's hand in a manner that she could but\nunderstand. She did not return the pressure, but she did not resent\nit.\n\n\"Clarissa,\" said Patience, when they were together that night, \"dear\nClarissa!\"\n\nClary knew that when she was called Clarissa by her sister something\nspecial was meant. \"What is it?\" she asked. \"What are you going to\nsay now?\"\n\n\"You know that I am thinking only of your happiness. My darling, he\ndoesn't mean it.\"\n\n\"How do you know? What right have you to say so? Why am I to be\nthought such a fool as not to know what I ought to do?\"\n\n\"Nobody thinks that you are a fool, Clary. I know how clever you\nare,--and how good. But I cannot bear that you should be unhappy.\nIf he had meant it, he would have spoken to papa. If you will only\ntell me that you are not thinking of him, that he is not making you\nunhappy, I will not say a word further.\"\n\n\"I am thinking of him, and he is making me unhappy,\" said Clarissa,\nbursting into tears. \"But I don't know why you should say that he is\na liar, and dishonest, and everything that is bad.\"\n\n\"I have neither said that, nor thought it, Clary.\"\n\n\"That is what you mean. He did say that he loved me.\"\n\n\"And you,--you did not answer him?\"\n\n\"No;--I said nothing. I can't explain it, and I don't want to explain\nit. I did not say a word to him. You came; and then he went away. If\nI am to be unhappy, I can't help it. He did say that he loved me, and\nI do love him.\"\n\n\"Will you tell papa?\"\n\n\"No;--I will not. It would be out of the question. He would go to\nRalph, and there would be a row, and I would not have it for worlds.\"\nThen she tried to smile. \"Other girls are unhappy, and I don't see\nwhy I'm to be better off than the rest. I know I am a fool. You'll\nnever be unhappy, because you are not a fool. But, Patience, I have\ntold you everything, and if you are not true to me I will never\nforgive you.\" Patience promised that she would be true; and then they\nembraced and were friends.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nRALPH NEWTON'S TROUBLES.\n\n\nJuly had come, the second week in July, and Ralph Newton had not\nas yet given any reply to that very definite proposition which had\nbeen made to him after the little dinner by Mr. Neefit. Now the\nproposition was one which certainly required an answer;--and all the\neffect which it had hitherto had upon our friend was to induce him\nnot to include Conduit Street in any of his daily walks. It has\nalready been said that before the offer was made to him, when he\nbelieved that Polly's fortune would be more than Mr. Neefit had been\nable to promise, he had determined that nothing should induce him\nto marry the daughter of a breeches-maker; and therefore the answer\nmight have been easy. Nevertheless he made no answer, but kept out\nof Conduit Street, and allowed the three pair of breeches to be sent\nhome to him without trying them on. This was very wrong; for Mr.\nNeefit, though perhaps indelicate, had at least been generous and\ntrusting;--and a definite answer should have been given before the\nmiddle of July.\n\nTroubles were coming thick upon Ralph Newton. He had borrowed a\nhundred pounds from Mr. Neefit, but this he had done under pressure\nof a letter from his brother the parson. He owed the parson,--we\nwill not say how much. He would get fifty pounds or a hundred from\nthe parson every now and again, giving an assurance that it should\nbe repaid in a month or six weeks. Sometimes the promise would be\nkept,--and sometimes not. The parson, as a bachelor, was undoubtedly\na rich man. He had a living of \u00c2\u00a3400 a year, and some fortune of his\nown; but he had tastes of his own, and was repairing the Church at\nPeele Newton, his parish in Hampshire. It would therefore sometimes\nhappen that he was driven to ask his brother for money. The hundred\npounds which had been borrowed from Mr. Neefit had been sent down\nto Peele Newton with a mere deduction of \u00c2\u00a325 for current expenses.\nTwenty-five pounds do not go far in current expenses in London with a\nman who is given to be expensive, and Ralph Newton was again in want\nof funds.\n\nAnd there were other troubles, all coming from want of money. Mr.\nHorsball, of the Moonbeam, who was generally known in the sporting\nworld as a man who never did ask for his money, had remarked that\nas Mr. Newton's bill was now above a thousand, he should like a\nlittle cash. Mr. Newton's bill at two months for \u00c2\u00a3500 would be quite\nsatisfactory. \"Would Mr. Newton accept the enclosed document?\" Mr.\nNewton did accept the document, but he didn't like it. How was he to\npay \u00c2\u00a3500 in the beginning of September, unless indeed he got it from\nMr. Neefit? He might raise money, no doubt, on his own interest in\nthe Newton Priory estate. But that estate would never be his were he\nto die before his uncle, and he knew that assistance from the Jews on\nsuch security would ruin him altogether. Of his own property there\nwas still a remnant left. He owned houses in London from which he\nstill got some income. But they were mortgaged, and the title-deeds\nnot in his possession, and his own attorney made difficulties about\nobtaining for him a further advance.\n\nHe was sitting one bright July morning in his own room in St. James's\nStreet, over a very late breakfast, with his two friends, Captain\nFooks and Lieutenant Cox, when a little annoyance of a similar kind\nfell upon him;--a worse annoyance, indeed, than that which had come\nfrom Mr. Horsball, for Mr. Horsball had not been spiteful enough to\ncall upon him. There came a knock at his door, and young Mr. Moggs\nwas ushered into the room. Now Mr. Moggs was the son of Booby and\nMoggs, the well-known bootmakers of Old Bond Street; and the boots\nthey had made for Ralph Newton had been infinite in number, as they\nhad also, no doubt, been excellent in make and leather. But Booby and\nMoggs had of late wanted money, had written many letters, and for\nfour months had not seen the face of their customer. When a gentleman\nis driven by his indebtedness to go to another tradesman, it is, so\nto say, \"all up with him\" in the way of credit. There is nothing the\ntradesman dislikes so much as this, as he fears that the rival is\ngoing to get the ready money after he has given the credit. And yet\nwhat is a gentleman to do when his demand for further goods at the\nold shop is met by a request for a little ready money? We know what\nRalph Newton did at the establishment in Conduit Street. But then Mr.\nNeefit was a very peculiar man.\n\nCox had just lighted his cigar, and Fooks was filling his pipe when\nOntario Moggs entered the room. This rival in the regards of Polly\nNeefit was not at that time personally known to Ralph Newton; but\nthe name, as mentioned by his servant, was painfully familiar to him.\n\"Oh, Mr. Moggs,--ah;--it's your father, I suppose, that I know. Sit\ndown, Mr. Moggs;--will you have a cup of tea;--or perhaps a glass of\nbrandy? Take a cigar, Mr. Moggs.\" But Moggs declined all refreshment\nfor the body. He was a tall, thin, young man, with long straggling\nhair, a fierce eye, very thick lips, and a flat nose,--a nose which\nseemed to be all nostril;--and then, below his mouth was a tuft of\nbeard, which he called an imperial. It was the glory of Ontario\nMoggs to be a politician;--it was his ambition to be a poet;--it was\nhis nature to be a lover;--it was his disgrace to be a bootmaker.\nDependent on a stern father, and aware that it behoved him to earn\nhis bread, he could not but obey; but he groaned under this servitude\nto trade, and was only happy when speaking at his debating club,\nheld at the Cheshire Cheese, or when basking in the beauty of Polly\nNeefit. He was great upon Strikes,--in reference to which perilous\nsubject he was altogether at variance with his father, who worshipped\ncapital and hated unions. Ontario held horrible ideas about\nco-operative associations, the rights of labour, and the welfare of\nthe masses. Thrice he had quarrelled with his father;--but the old\nman loved his son, and though he was stern, strove to bring the young\nman into the ways of money-making. How was he to think of marrying\nPolly Neefit,--as to the expediency of which arrangement Mr. Moggs\nsenior quite agreed with Mr. Moggs junior,--unless he would show\nhimself to be a man of business? Did he think that old Neefit would\ngive his money to be wasted upon strikes? Ontario, who was as honest\na fool as ever lived, told his father that he didn't care a straw for\nNeefit's money. Then Moggs the father had made a plunge against the\ncounter with his sharp-pointed shoemaker's knife, which he always\nheld in his hand, that had almost been fatal to himself; for the\nknife broke at the thrust, and the fragment cut his wrist. At this\ntime there was no real Booby, and the firm was in truth Moggs, and\nMoggs only. The great question was whether it should become Moggs and\nSon. But what tradesman would take a partner into his firm who began\nby declaring that strikes were the safeguards of trade, and that\nhe,--the proposed partner,--did not personally care for money?\nNevertheless old Moggs persevered; and Ontario, alive to the fact\nthat it was his duty to be a bootmaker, was now attempting to carry\non his business in the manner laid down for him by his father.\n\nA worse dun,--a dun with less power of dunning,--than Ontario Moggs\ncould not be conceived. His only strength lay in his helplessness.\nWhen he found that Mr. Newton had two friends with him, his lips were\nsealed. To ask for money at all was very painful to him, but to ask\nfor it before three men was beyond his power. Ralph Newton, seeing\nsomething of this, felt that generosity demanded of him that he\nshould sacrifice himself. \"I'm afraid you've come about your bill,\nMr. Moggs,\" he said. Ontario Moggs, who on the subject of Trades'\nUnions at the Cheshire Cheese could pour forth a flood of eloquence\nthat would hold the room in rapt admiration, and then bring down a\ntumult of applause, now stammered out a half-expressed assent. \"As\nMr. Newton was engaged perhaps he had better call again.\"\n\n\"Well;--thankee, yes. It would be as well. But what's the total, Mr.\nMoggs?\" Ontario could not bring himself to mention the figures, but\nhanded a paper to our friend. \"Bless my soul! that's very bad,\" said\nour friend. \"Over two hundred pounds for boots! How long can your\nfather give me?\"\n\n\"He's a little pressed just at present,\" whispered Moggs.\n\n\"Yes;--and he has my bill, which he was forced to take up at\nChristmas. It's quite true.\" Moggs said not a word, though he had\nbeen especially commissioned to instruct the debtor that his father\nwould be forced to apply through his solicitor, unless he should\nreceive at least half the amount due before the end of the next week.\n\"Tell your father that I will certainly call within the next three\ndays and tell him what I can do;--or, at least, what I can't do.\nYou are sure you won't take a cigar?\" Moggs was quite sure that he\nwouldn't take a cigar, and retired, thanking Ralph as though some\nexcellent arrangement had been made which would altogether prevent\nfurther difficulties.\n\n\"That's the softest chap I ever saw,\" said Lieutenant Cox.\n\n\"I wish my fellows would treat me like that,\" said Captain Fooks.\n\"But I never knew a fellow have the luck that Newton has. I don't\nsuppose I owe a tenth of what you do.\"\n\n\"That's your idea of luck?\" said Ralph.\n\n\"Well;--yes. I owe next to nothing, but I'll be hanged if I can get\nanything done for me without being dunned up to my very eyes. You\nknow that chap of Neefit's? I'm blessed if he didn't ask me whether\nI meant to settle last year's bill, before he should send me home a\ncouple of cords I ordered! Now I don't owe Neefit twenty pounds if\nall was told.\"\n\n\"What did you do?\" asked Lieutenant Cox.\n\n\"I just walked out of the shop. Now I shall see whether they're sent\nor not. They tell me there's a fellow down at Rugby makes just as\nwell as Neefit, and never bothers you at all. What do you owe Neefit,\nNewton?\"\n\n\"Untold sums.\"\n\n\"But how much really?\"\n\n\"Don't you hear me say the sums are untold?\"\n\n\"Oh; d----n it; I don't understand that. I'm never dark about\nanything of that kind. I'll go bail it's more than five times what I\ndo.\"\n\n\"Very likely. If you had given your orders generously, as I have\ndone, you would have been treated nobly. What good has a man in\nlooking at twenty pounds on his books? Of course he must get in the\nsmall sums.\"\n\n\"I suppose there's something in that,\" said the captain thoughtfully.\nAt this moment the conversation was interrupted by the entrance of\nanother emissary,--an emissary from that very establishment to which\nthey were alluding. It was Ralph Newton's orders that no one should\never be denied to him when he was really in his rooms. He had fought\nthe battle long enough to know that such denials create unnecessary\nanimosity. And then, as he said, they were simply the resources of\na coward. It was the duty of a brave man to meet his enemy face to\nface. Fortune could never give him the opportunity of doing that\npleasantly, in the field, as might happen any day to his happy\nfriends, Captain Fooks and Lieutenant Cox; but he was determined\nthat he would accustom himself to stand fire;--and that, therefore,\nhe would never run away from a dun. Now there slipped very slowly\ninto the room, that most mysterious person who was commonly called\nHerr Bawwah,--much to the astonishment of the three young gentlemen,\nas the celebrated cutter of leather had never previously been seen\nby either of them elsewhere than standing silent at his board in\nNeefit's shop, with his knife in his hands. They looked at one\nanother, and the two military gentlemen thought that Mr. Neefit was\nvery much in earnest when he sent Bawwah to look for his money. Mr.\nNeefit was very much in earnest; but on this occasion his emissary\nhad not come for money. \"What, Herr Bawwah;--is that you?\" said\nRalph, making the best he could of the name. \"Is there anything wrong\nat the shop?\" The German looked slowly round the room, and then\nhanded to the owner of it a little note without a word.\n\nRalph read the note,--to himself. It was written on one of the shop\nbills, and ran as follows:--\"Have you thought of what I was saying?\nIf so, I should be happy to see Mr. Newton either in Conduit Street\nor at Alexandrina Cottage.\" There was neither signature nor date.\nRalph knew what he was called upon to do, as well as though four\npages of an elaborate epistle had been indited to him. And he knew,\ntoo, that he was bound to give an answer. He asked the \"Herr\" to sit\ndown, and prepared to write an answer at once. He offered the Herr a\nglass of brandy, which the Herr swallowed at a gulp. He handed the\nHerr a cigar, which the Herr pocketed;--and in gratitude for the\nlatter favour some inarticulate grunt of thanks was uttered. Ralph at\nonce wrote his reply, while the two friends smoked, looked on, and\nwondered. \"Dear Mr. Neefit,--I will be with you at eleven to-morrow\nmorning. Yours most truly, RALPH NEWTON.\" This he handed, with\nanother glass of brandy, to the Herr. The Herr swallowed the second\nglass,--as he would have done a third had it been offered to\nhim,--and then took his departure.\n\n\"That was another dun;--eh, Newton?\" asked the lieutenant.\n\n\"What a conjuror you are?\" said Ralph.\n\n\"I never heard of his sending Bawwah out before,\" said the captain.\n\n\"He never does under two hundred and fifty pounds,\" said Ralph. \"It's\na mark of the greatest respect. If I wore nothing but brown cords,\nlike you, I never should have seen the Herr here.\"\n\n\"I never had a pair of brown cords in my life!\" said the offended\ncaptain. After this the conversation fell away, and the two warriors\nwent off to their military occupations at the Horse Guards, where, no\ndoubt, the Commander-in-chief was waiting for them with impatience.\n\nRalph Newton had much to think of, and much that required thinking of\nat once. Did he mean to make an offer to Clary Underwood? Did he mean\nto take Polly Neefit and her \u00c2\u00a320,000? Did he mean to marry at all?\nDid he mean to go to the dogs? Had he ever in his life seen anybody\nhalf so beautiful as Mary Bonner? What was he to say to Mr. Moggs?\nHow was he to manage about that \u00c2\u00a3500 which Horsball would demand of\nhim in September? In what terms could he speak to Neefit of the money\ndue both for breeches and the loan, in the event of his declining\nPolly? And then, generally, how was he to carry on the war? He was\nthoroughly disgusted with himself as he thought of all the evil that\nhe had done, and of the good which he had omitted to do. While he was\nyet at college Sir Thomas had been anxious that he should be called\nto the Bar, and had again and again begged of him to consent to this\nas a commencement of his life in London. But Ralph had replied,--and\nhad at last replied with so much decision that Sir Thomas had\nabandoned the subject,--that as it was out of the question that he\nshould ever make money at the Bar, the fact of his being called would\nbe useless to him. He argued that he need not waste his life because\nhe was not a lawyer. It was not his intention to waste his life. He\nhad a sufficient property of his own at once, and must inherit a much\nlarger property later in life. He would not be called to the Bar, nor\nwould he go into the army, nor would he go abroad for any lengthened\ncourse of travelling. He was fond of hunting, but he would keep his\nhunting within measure. Surely an English private gentleman might\nlive to some profit in his own country! He would go out in honours,\nand take a degree, and then make himself happy among his books. Such\nhad been his own plan for himself at twenty-one. At twenty-two he had\nquarrelled with the tutor at his college, and taken his name off the\nbooks without any degree. About this, too, he had argued with Sir\nThomas, expressing a strong opinion that a university degree was in\nEngland, of all pretences, the most vain and hollow. At twenty-three\nhe began his career at the Moonbeam with two horses,--and from that\nday to this hunting had been the chief aim of his life. During the\nlast winter he had hunted six days a week,--assuring Sir Thomas,\nhowever, that at the end of that season his wild oats would have\nbeen sown as regarded that amusement, and that henceforth he should\nconfine himself to two days a week. Since that he had justified the\nfour horses which still remained at the Moonbeam by the alleged fact\nthat horses were drugs in April, but would be pearls of price in\nNovember. Sir Thomas could only expostulate, and when he did so, his\nlate ward and present friend, though he was always courteous, would\nalways argue. Then he fell, as was natural, into intimacies with such\nmen as Cox and Fooks. There was no special harm either in Cox or\nFooks; but no one knew better than did Ralph Newton himself that they\nwere not such friends as he had promised himself when he was younger.\n\nFathers, guardians, and the race of old friends generally, hardly\never give sufficient credit to the remorse which young men themselves\nfeel when they gradually go astray. They see the better as plainly\nas do their elders, though they so often follow the worse,--as not\nunfrequently do the elders also. Ralph Newton passed hardly a day\nof his life without a certain amount of remorse in that he had not\nmanaged himself better than he had done, and was now doing. He knew\nthat Fortune had been very good to him, and that he had hitherto\nwasted all her gifts. And now there came the question whether it\nwas as yet too late to retrieve the injury which he had done. He\ndid believe,--not even as yet doubting his power to do well,--that\neverything might be made right, only that his money difficulties\npressed him so hardly. He took pen and paper, and made out a list of\nhis debts, heading the catalogue with Mr. Horsball of the Moonbeam.\nThe amount, when added together, came to something over four thousand\npounds, including a debt of three hundred to his brother the parson.\nThen he endeavoured to value his property, and calculated that if he\nsold all that was remaining to him he might pay what he owed, and\nhave something about fifty pounds per annum left to live upon till he\nshould inherit his uncle's property. But he doubted the accuracy even\nof this, knowing that new and unexpected debts will always crop up\nwhen the day of settlement arrives. Of course he could not live upon\nfifty pounds a year. It would have seemed to him to be almost equally\nimpossible to live upon four times fifty pounds. He had given Sir\nThomas a promise that he would not raise money on post-obits on his\nuncle's life, and hitherto he had kept that promise. He thought that\nhe would be guilty of no breach of promise were he so to obtain\nfunds, telling Sir Thomas of his purpose, and asking the lawyer's\nassistance; but he knew that if he did this all his chance of future\nhigh prosperity would be at an end. His uncle might live these twenty\nyears, and in that time he, Ralph, might quite as readily die. Money\nmight no doubt be raised, but this could only be done at a cost\nwhich would be utterly ruinous to him. There was one way out of his\ndifficulty. He might marry a girl with money. A girl with money had\nbeen offered to him, and a girl, too, who was very pretty and very\npleasant. But then, to marry the daughter of a breeches-maker!\n\nAnd why not? He had been teaching himself all his life to despise\nconventionalities. He had ridiculed degrees. He had laughed at\nthe rank and standing of a barrister. \"The rank is but the guinea\nstamp--the man's the gowd for a' that.\" How often had he declared to\nhimself and others that that should be his motto through life. And\nmight not he be as much a man, and would not his metal be as pure,\nwith Polly Neefit for his wife as though he were to marry a duchess?\nAs for love, he thought he could love Polly dearly. He knew that he\nhad done some wrong in regard to poor Clary; but he by no means knew\nhow much wrong he had done. A single word of love,--which had been\nso very much to her in her innocence,--had been so little to him who\nwas not innocent. If he could allow himself to choose out of all the\nwomen he had ever seen, he would, he thought, instigated rather by\nthe ambition of having the loveliest woman in the world for his wife\nthan by any love, have endeavoured to win Mary Bonner as his own. But\nthat was out of the question. Mary Bonner was as poor as himself;\nand, much as he admired her, he certainly could not tell himself\nthat he loved her. Polly Neefit would pull him through all his\ndifficulties. Nevertheless, he could not make up his mind to ask\nPolly Neefit to be his wife.\n\nBut he must make up his mind either that he would or that he would\nnot. He must see Mr. Neefit on the morrow;--and within the next few\ndays he must call on Mr. Moggs, unless he broke his word. And in two\nmonths' time he must have \u00c2\u00a3500 for Mr. Horsball. Suppose he were to\ngo to Sir Thomas, tell his whole story without reserve, and ask his\nold friend's advice! Everything without reserve he could not tell.\nHe could say nothing to the father of that scene on the lawn with\nClarissa. But of his own pecuniary difficulties, and of Mr. Neefit's\ngenerous offer, he was sure that he could tell the entire truth.\nHe did go to Southampton Buildings, and after some harsh language\nbetween himself and Mr. Stemm,--Sir Thomas being away at the\ntime,--he managed to make an appointment for nine o'clock that\nevening at his late guardian's chambers. At nine o'clock precisely\nhe found himself seated with Sir Thomas, all among the books in\nSouthampton Buildings. \"Perhaps you'll have a cup of tea,\" said Sir\nThomas. \"Stemm, give us some tea.\" Ralph waited till the tea was\nhanded to him and Stemm was gone. Then he told his story.\n\nHe told it very fairly as against himself. He brought out his little\naccount and explained to the lawyer how it was that he made himself\nout to be worth fifty pounds a year, and no more. \"Oh, heavens, what\na mess you have made of it!\" said the lawyer, holding up both his\nhands. \"No doubt I have,\" said Ralph,--\"a terrible mess! But as I now\ncome to you for advice hear me out to the end. You can say nothing as\nto my folly which I do not know already.\" \"Go on,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\"Go on,--I'll hear you.\" It may, however, be remarked, by the way,\nthat when an old gentleman in Sir Thomas's position is asked his\nadvice under such circumstances, he ought to be allowed to remark\nthat he had prophesied all these things beforehand. \"I told you so,\"\nis such a comfortable thing to say! And when an old gentleman has\ntaken much fruitless trouble about a young gentleman, he ought\nat least not to be interrupted in his remarks as to that young\ngentleman's folly. But Ralph was energetic, and, knowing that he had\na point before him, would go on with his story. \"And now,\" he said,\n\"I am coming to a way of putting these things right which has been\nsuggested to me. You won't like it, I know. But it would put me on my\nlegs.\"\n\n\"Raising money on your expectations?\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"No;--that is what I must come to if this plan don't answer.\"\n\n\"Anything will be better than that,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\nThen Ralph dashed at the suggestion of marriage without further\ndelay. \"You have heard of Mr. Neefit, the breeches-maker!\" It so\nhappened that Sir Thomas never had heard of Mr. Neefit. \"Well;--he is\na tradesman in Conduit Street. He has a daughter, and he will give\nher twenty thousand pounds.\"\n\n\"You don't mean to run away with the breeches-maker's daughter?\"\nejaculated Sir Thomas.\n\n\"Certainly not. I shouldn't get the twenty thousand pounds if I did.\"\nThen he explained it all;--how Neefit had asked him to the house, and\noffered him the girl; how the girl herself was as pretty and nice as\na girl could be; and how he thought,--though as to that he expressed\nhimself with some humility,--that, were he to propose to her, the\ngirl might perhaps take him.\n\n\"I dare say she would,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"Well;--now you know it all. In her way, she has been educated.\nNeefit p\u00c3\u00a8re is utterly illiterate and ignorant. He is an honest man,\nas vulgar as he can be,--or rather as unlike you and me, which is\nwhat men mean when they talk of vulgarity,--and he makes the best\nof breeches. Neefit m\u00c3\u00a8re is worse than the father,--being cross and\nill-conditioned, as far as I can see. Polly is as good as gold; and\nif I put a house over my head with her money, of course her father\nand her mother will be made welcome there. Your daughters would not\nlike to meet them, but I think they could put up with Polly. Now you\nknow about all that I can tell you.\"\n\nRalph had been so rapid, so energetic, and withal so reasonable, that\nSir Thomas, at this period of the interview, was unable to refer to\nany of his prophecies. What advice was he to give? Should he adjure\nthis young man not to marry the breeches-maker's daughter because of\nthe blood of the Newtons and the expected estate, or were he to do so\neven on the score of education and general unfitness, he must suggest\nsome other mode or means of living. But how could he advise the\nfuture Newton of Newton Priory to marry Polly Neefit? The Newtons had\nbeen at Newton Priory for centuries, and the men Newtons had always\nmarried ladies, as the women Newtons had always either married\ngentlemen or remained unmarried. Sir Thomas, too, was of his nature,\nand by all his convictions, opposed to such matches. \"You have hardly\nrealised,\" said he, \"what it would be to have such a father-in-law\nand such a mother-in-law;--or probably such a wife.\"\n\n\"Yes, I have. I have realised all that.\"\n\n\"Of course, if you have made up your mind--\"\n\n\"But I have not made up my mind, Sir Thomas. I must make it up\nbefore eleven o'clock to-morrow morning, because I must then be with\nNeefit,--by appointment. At this moment I am so much in doubt that I\nam almost inclined to toss up.\"\n\n\"I would sooner cut my throat!\" said Sir Thomas, forgetting his\nwisdom amidst the perplexities of his position.\n\n\"Not quite that, Sir Thomas. I suppose you mean to say that anything\nwould be better than such a marriage?\"\n\n\"I don't suppose you care for the girl,\" said Sir Thomas, crossly.\n\n\"I do not feel uneasy on that score. If I did not like her, and\nthink that I could love her, I would have nothing to do with it. She\nherself is charming,--though I should lie if I were to say that she\nwere a lady.\"\n\n\"And the father offered her to you?\"\n\n\"Most distinctly,--and named the fortune.\"\n\n\"Knowing your own condition as to money?\"\n\n\"Almost exactly;--so much so that I do not doubt he will go on with\nit when he knows everything. He had heard about my uncle's property,\nand complimented me by saying that I am a,--gentleman.\"\n\n\"He does not deserve to have a daughter,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"I don't know about that. According to his lights, he means to do the\nbest he can for her. And, indeed, I think myself that he might do\nworse. She will probably become Mrs. Newton of Newton Priory if she\nmarries me; and the investment of Neefit's twenty thousand pounds\nwon't be so bad.\"\n\n\"Nothing on earth can make her a lady.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure of that,\" said Ralph. \"Nothing on earth can make her\nmother a lady; but of Polly I should have hopes. You, however, are\nagainst it?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"Then what ought I to do?\" Sir Thomas rubbed the calf of his leg and\nwas silent. \"The only advice you have given me hitherto was to cut my\nthroat,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"No, I didn't. I don't know what you're to do. You've ruined\nyourself;--that's all.\"\n\n\"But there is a way out of the ruin. In all emergencies there is a\nbetter and a worse course. What, now, is the better course?\"\n\n\"You don't know how to earn a shilling,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"No; I don't,\" said Ralph Newton.\n\nSir Thomas rubbed his face and scratched his head; but did not know\nhow to give advice. \"You have made your bed, and you must lie upon\nit,\" he said.\n\n\"Exactly;--but which way am I to get into it, and which way shall I\nget out?\" Sir Thomas could only rub his face and scratch his head. \"I\nthought it best to come and tell you everything,\" said Ralph. That\nwas all very well, but Sir Thomas would not advise him to marry the\nbreeches-maker's daughter.\n\n\"It is a matter,\" Sir Thomas said at last, \"in which you must be\nguided by your own feelings. I wish it were otherwise. I can say no\nmore.\" Then Ralph took his leave, and wandered all round St. James's\nPark and the purlieus of Westminster till midnight, endeavouring to\nmake up his mind, and building castles in the air, as to what he\nwould do with himself, and how he would act, if he had not brought\nhimself into so hopeless a mess of troubles.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nONTARIO MOGGS.\n\n\nOn the following morning Ralph Newton was in Conduit Street exactly\nat the hour named. He had not even then made up his mind;--but he\nthought that he might get an extension of the time allowed him for\ndecision. After all, it was hardly a month yet since the proposition\nwas made to him. He found Mr. Neefit in the back shop, measuring a\ncustomer. \"I'll be with you in two minutes,\" said Mr. Neefit, just\nputting his head through the open door, and then going back to his\nwork; \"3--1--1\/8, Waddle; Sir George isn't quite as stout as he was\nlast year. Oh, no, Sir George; we won't tie you in too tight. Leave\nit to us, Sir George. The last pair too tight? Oh, no; I think not,\nSir George. Perhaps your man isn't as careful in cleaning as he ought\nto be. Gentlemen's servants do get so careless, it quite sickens\none!\" So Mr. Neefit went on, and as Sir George was very copious in\nthe instructions which he had to give,--all of which, by-the-bye,\nwere absolutely thrown away,--Ralph Newton became tired of waiting.\nHe remembered too that he was not there as a customer, but almost\nas a member of the family, and the idea sickened him. He bethought\nhimself that on his first visit to Conduit Street he had seen his\nPolly in the shop, cutting up strips wherewith her father would\nmeasure gentlemen's legs. She must then have been nearly fifteen, and\nthe occupation, as he felt, was not one fitting for the girl who was\nto be his wife. \"Now, Mr. Newton,\" said Mr. Neefit, as Sir George at\nlast left the little room. The day was hot, and Mr. Neefit had been\nat work in his shirt sleeves. Nor did he now put on his coat. He\nwiped his brow, put his cotton handkerchief inside his braces, and\nshook hands with our hero. \"Well, Mr. Newton,\" he said, \"what do you\nthink of it? I couldn't learn much about it, but it seemed to me that\nyou and Polly got on famous that night. I thought we'd have seen you\nout there again before this.\"\n\n\"I couldn't come, Mr. Neefit, as long as there was a doubt.\"\n\n\"Oh, as to doubts,--doubts be bothered. Of course you must run your\nchance with Polly like any other man.\"\n\n\"Just so.\"\n\n\"But the way to get a girl like that isn't not to come and see her\nfor a month. There are others after our Polly, I can tell you;--and\nmen who would take her with nothing but her smock on.\"\n\n\"I'm quite sure of that. No one can see her without admiring her.\"\n\n\"Then what's the good of talking of doubts? I like you because you\nare a gentleman;--and I can put you on your legs, which, from all I\nhear, is a kind of putting you want bad enough just at present. Say\nthe word, and come down to tea this evening.\"\n\n\"The fact is, Mr. Neefit, this is a very serious matter.\"\n\n\"Serious! Twenty thousand pounds is serious. There ain't a doubt\nabout that. If you mean to say you don't like the bargain,\"--and\nas he said this there came a black cloud upon Mr. Neefit's\nbrow,--\"you've only got to say the word. Our Polly is not to be\npressed upon any man. But don't let's have any shilly-shallying.\"\n\n\"Tell me one thing, Mr. Neefit.\"\n\n\"Well;--what's that?\"\n\n\"Have you spoken to your daughter about this?\"\n\nMr. Neefit was silent for a moment, \"Well, no; I haven't,\" he said.\n\"But, I spoke to her mother, and women is always talking. Mind,\nI don't know what our Polly would say to you, but I do think she\nexpects something. There's a chap lives nigh to us who used always to\nbe sneaking round; but she has snubbed him terribly this month past.\nSo my wife tells me. You come and try, Mr. Newton, and then you'll\nknow all about it.\"\n\nRalph was aware that he had not as yet begun to explain his\ndifficulty to the anxious father. \"You see, Mr. Neefit,\" he\nsaid,--and then he paused. It had been much easier for him to talk to\nSir Thomas than to the breaches-maker.\n\n\"If you don't like it,--say so,\" said Mr. Neefit;--\"and don't let us\nhave no shilly-shallying.\"\n\n\"I do like it.\"\n\n\"Then give us your hand, and come out this evening and have a bit\nof some'at to eat and a drop of some'at hot, and pop the question.\nThat's about the way to do it.\"\n\n\"Undoubtedly;--but marriage is such a serious thing!\"\n\n\"So it is serious,--uncommon serious to owe a fellow a lot of money\nyou can't pay him. I call that very serious.\"\n\n\"Mr. Neefit, I owe you nothing but what I can pay you.\"\n\n\"You're very slow about it, Mr. Newton; that's all I can say. But I\nwasn't just talking of myself. After what's passed between you and me\nI ain't going to be hard upon you.\"\n\n\"I'll tell you what, Mr. Neefit,\" said Ralph at last,--\"of course you\ncan understand that a man may have difficulties with his family.\"\n\n\"Because of my being a breeches-maker?\" said Neefit contemptuously.\n\n\"I won't say that; but there may be difficulties.\"\n\n\"Twenty thousand pounds does away with a deal of them things.\"\n\n\"Just so;--but as I was saying, you can understand that there may be\nfamily difficulties. I only say that because I ought perhaps to have\ngiven you an answer sooner. I won't go down with you this evening.\"\n\n\"You won't?\"\n\n\"Not to-night;--but I'll be with you on Saturday evening, if that\nwill suit you.\"\n\n\"Come and have a bit of dinner again on Sunday,\" said Neefit. Ralph\naccepted the invitation, shook hands with Neefit, and escaped from\nthe shop.\n\nWhen he thought of it all as he went to his rooms, he told himself\nthat he had now as good as engaged himself to Polly;--as good or as\nbad. Of course, after what had passed, he could not go to the house\nagain without asking her to be his wife. Were he to do so Neefit\nwould be justified in insulting him. And yet when he undertook to\nmake this fourth visit to the cottage, he had done so with the\nintention of allowing himself a little more time for judgment. He saw\nplainly enough that he was going to allow himself to drift into this\nmarriage without any real decision of his own. He prided himself on\nbeing strong, and how could any man be more despicably weak than\nthis? It was, indeed, true that in all the arguments he had used with\nSir Thomas he had defended the Neefit marriage as though it was the\nbest course he could adopt;--and even Sir Thomas had not ultimately\nventured to oppose it. Would it not be as well for him to consider\nthat he had absolutely made up his mind to marry Polly?\n\nOn the Friday he called at Mr. Moggs's house; Mr. Moggs senior was\nthere, and Mr. Moggs junior, and also a shopman. \"I was sorry,\" said\nhe, \"that when your son called, I had friends with me, and could\nhardly explain circumstances.\"\n\n\"It didn't signify at all,\" said Moggs junior.\n\n\"But it does signify, Mr. Newton,\" said Moggs senior, who on this\nmorning was not in a good humour with his ledger. \"Two hundred and\nseventeen pounds, three shillings and four-pence is a good deal of\nmoney for boots, Mr. Newton, You must allow that.\"\n\n\"Indeed it is, Mr. Moggs.\"\n\n\"There hasn't been what you may call a settlement for years.\nTwenty-five pounds paid in the last two years!\" and Mr. Moggs as he\nspoke had his finger on the fatal page. \"That won't do, you know,\nMr. Newton;--that won't do at all!\" Mr. Moggs, as he looked into his\ncustomer's face, worked himself up into a passion. \"But I suppose you\nhave come to settle it now, Mr. Newton?\"\n\n\"Not exactly at this moment, Mr. Moggs.\"\n\n\"It must be settled very soon, Mr. Newton;--it must indeed. My son\ncan't be calling on you day after day, and all for nothing. We can't\nstand that you know, Mr. Newton. Perhaps you'll oblige me by saying\nwhen it will be settled.\" Then Ralph explained that he had called\nfor that purpose, that he was making arrangements for paying all his\ncreditors, and that he hoped that Mr. Moggs would have his money\nwithin three months at the farthest. Mr. Moggs then proposed that he\nshould have his customer's bill at three months, and the interview\nended by the due manufacture of a document to that effect. Ralph,\nwhen he entered the shop, had not intended to give a bill; but the\npressure had been too great upon him, and he had yielded. It would\nmatter little, however, if he married Polly Neefit. And had he not\nnow accepted it as his destiny that he must marry Polly Neefit?\n\nThe Saturday he passed in much trouble of spirit, and with many\ndoubts; but the upshot of it all was that he would keep his\nengagement for the Sunday. His last chance of escape would have been\nto call in Conduit Street on the Saturday and tell Mr. Neefit, with\nsuch apologies as he might be able to make, that the marriage would\nnot be suitable. While sitting at breakfast he had almost resolved to\ndo this;--but when five o'clock came, after which, as he well knew,\nthe breeches-maker would not be found, no such step had been taken.\nHe dined that evening and went to the theatre with Lieutenant Cox.\nAt twelve they were joined by Fooks and another gay spirit, and they\neat chops and drank stout and listened to songs at Evans's till near\ntwo. Cox and Fooks said that they had never been so jolly in their\nlives;--but Ralph,--though he eat and drank as much and talked more\nthan the others,--was far from happy. There came upon him a feeling\nthat after to-morrow he would never again be able to call himself\na gentleman. Who would associate with him after he had married\nthe breeches-maker's daughter? He laid in bed late on Sunday, and\ncertainly went to no place of worship. Would it not be well even yet\nto send a letter down to Neefit, telling him that the thing could not\nbe? The man would be very angry with him, and would have great cause\nto be angry. But it would at least be better to do this now than\nhereafter. But when four o'clock came no letter had been sent.\n\nPunctually at five the cab set him down at Alexandrina Cottage. How\nwell he seemed to know the place;--almost as well as though he were\nalready one of the family. He was shown into the drawing-room, and\nwhom should he see there, seated with Mr. and Mrs. and Miss Neefit,\nbut Ontario Moggs. It was clear enough that each of the party was ill\nat ease. Neefit welcomed him with almost boisterous hospitality. Mrs.\nNeefit merely curtseyed and bobbed at him. Polly smiled, and shook\nhands with him, and told him that he was welcome;--but even Polly was\na little beside herself. Ontario Moggs stood bolt upright and made\nhim a low bow, but did not attempt to speak.\n\n\"I hope your father is well,\" said Ralph, addressing himself to Moggs\njunior.\n\n\"Pretty well, I thank you,\" said Mr. Moggs, getting up from his chair\nand bowing a second time.\n\nMr. Neefit waited for a moment or two during which no one except\nRalph spoke a word, and then invited his intended son-in-law to\nfollow him into the garden. \"The fact is,\" said Neefit winking, \"this\nis Mrs. N.'s doing. It don't make any difference, you know.\"\n\n\"I don't quite understand,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"You see we've known Onty Moggs all our lives, and no doubt he has\nbeen sweet upon Polly. But Polly don't care for him, mind you. You\nask her. And Mrs. N. has got it into her head that she don't want you\nfor Polly. But I do, Mr. Newton;--and I'm master.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't for the world make a family quarrel.\"\n\n\"There won't be no quarrelling. It's I as has the purse, and it's the\npurse as makes the master, Mr. Newton. Don't you mind Moggs. Moggs is\nvery well in his way, but he ain't going to have our Polly. Well;--he\ncome down here to-day, just by chance;--and what did Mrs. N. do\nbut ask him to stop and eat a bit of dinner! It don't make any\ndifference, you know. You come in now, and just go on as though Moggs\nweren't there. You and Polly shall have it all to yourselves this\nevening.\"\n\nHere was a new feature added to the pleasures of his courtship! He\nhad a rival,--and such a rival;--his own bootmaker, whom he could\nnot pay, and whose father had insulted him a day or two since.\nMoggs junior would of course know why his customer was dining at\nAlexandrina Cottage, and would have his own feelings, too, upon the\noccasion.\n\n\"Don't you mind him,--no more than nothing,\" said Neefit, leading the\nway back into the drawing-room, and passing at the top of the kitchen\nstairs the young woman with the bit of salmon.\n\nThe dinner was not gay. In the first place, Neefit and Mrs. Neefit\ngave very explicit and very opposite directions as to the manner in\nwhich their guests were to walk in to dinner, the result of which\nwas that Ralph was obliged to give his arm to the elder lady, while\nOntario carried off the prize. Mrs. Neefit also gave directions as\nto the places, which were obeyed in spite of an attempt of Neefit's\nto contravene them. Ontario and Polly sat on one side of the table,\nwhile Ralph sat opposite to them. Neefit, when he saw that the\narrangement was made and could not be altered, lost his temper and\nscolded his wife. \"Law, papa, what does it matter?\" said Polly.\nPolly's position certainly was unpleasant enough; but she made head\nagainst her difficulties gallantly. Ontario, who had begun to guess\nthe truth, said not a word. He was not, however, long in making up\nhis mind that a personal encounter with Mr. Ralph Newton might be\ngood for his system. Mrs. Neefit nagged at her husband, and told\nhim when he complained about the meat, that if he would look after\nthe drinkables that would be quite enough for him to do. Ralph\nhimself found it to be impossible even to look as though things\nwere going right. Never in his life had he been in a position so\nuncomfortable,--or, as he thought, so disreputable. It was not to\nbe endured that Moggs, his bootmaker, should see him sitting at the\ntable of Neefit, his breeches-maker.\n\nThe dinner was at last over, and the port-wine was carried out into\nthe arbour;--not, on this occasion, by Polly, but by the maid. Polly\nand Mrs. Neefit went off together, while Ralph crowded into the\nlittle summer-house with Moggs and Neefit. In this way half an hour\nwas passed,--a half hour of terrible punishment. But there was worse\ncoming. \"Mr. Newton,\" said Neefit, \"I think I heard something about\nyour taking a walk with our Polly. If you like to make a start of it,\ndon't let us keep you. Moggs and I will have a pipe together.\"\n\n\"I also intend to walk with Miss Neefit,\" said Ontario, standing up\nbravely.\n\n\n[Illustration: \"I also intend to walk with Miss Neefit,\" said\nOntario, standing up bravely.]\n\n\n\"Two's company and three's none,\" said Neefit.\n\n\"No doubt,\" said Ontario; \"no doubt. I feel that myself. Mr. Newton,\nI've been attached to Miss Neefit these two years. I don't mind\nsaying it out straight before her father. I love Miss Neefit! I don't\nknow, sir, what your ideas are; but I love Miss Neefit! Perhaps, sir,\nyour ideas may be money;--my ideas are a pure affection for that\nyoung lady. Now, Mr. Newton, you know what my ideas are.\" Mr. Moggs\njunior was standing up when he made this speech, and, when he had\ncompleted it, he looked round, first upon her father and then upon\nhis rival.\n\n\"She's never given you no encouragement,\" said Neefit. \"How dare you\nspeak in that way about my Polly?\"\n\n\"I do dare,\" said Ontario. \"There!\"\n\n\"Will you tell Mr. Newton that she ever gave you any encouragement?\"\n\nOntario thought about it for a moment, before he replied. \"No;--I\nwill not,\" said he. \"To say that of any young woman wouldn't be in\naccord with my ideas.\"\n\n\"Because you can't. It's all gammon. She don't mean to have him, Mr.\nNewton. You may take my word for that. You go in and ask her if she\ndo. A pretty thing indeed! I can't invite my friend, Mr. Newton, to\neat a bit of dinner, and let him walk out with my Polly, but you must\ninterfere. If you had her to-morrow you wouldn't have a shilling with\nher.\"\n\n\"I don't want a shilling with her!\" said Ontario, still standing upon\nhis legs. \"I love her. Will Mr. Newton say as fair as that?\"\n\nMr. Newton found it very difficult to say anything. Even had he been\nthoroughly intent on the design of making Polly his wife, he could\nnot have brought himself to declare his love aloud, as had just\nbeen done by Mr. Moggs. \"This is a sort of matter that shouldn't be\ndiscussed in public,\" he said at last.\n\n\"Public or private, I love her!\" said Ontario Moggs with his hand on\nhis heart.\n\nPolly herself was certainly badly treated among them. She got no walk\nthat evening, and received no assurance of undying affection either\nfrom one suitor or the other. It became manifest even to Neefit\nhimself that the game could not be played out on this evening. He\ncould not turn Moggs off the premises, because his wife would have\ninterfered. Nor, had he done so, would it have been possible, after\nsuch an affair to induce Polly to stir from the house. She certainly\nhad been badly used among them; and so she took occasion to tell her\nfather when the visitors were both gone. They left the house together\nat about eight, and Polly at that time had not reappeared. Moggs went\nto the nearest station of the Midland Railway, and Ralph walked to\nthe Swiss Cottage. Certainly Mr. Neefit's little dinner had been\nunsuccessful; but Ralph Newton, as he went back to London, was almost\ndisposed to think that Providence had interposed to save him.\n\n\"I'll tell you what it is, father,\" said Polly to her papa, as soon\nas the two visitors had left the house, \"if that's the way you are\ngoing to go on, I'll never marry anybody as long as I live.\"\n\n\"My dear, it was all your mother,\" said Mr. Neefit. \"Now wasn't it\nall your mother? I wish she'd been blowed fust!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nSIR THOMAS IN HIS CHAMBERS.\n\n\nIt will be remembered that Sir Thomas Underwood had declined to\ngive his late ward any advice at that interview which took place in\nSouthampton Buildings;--or rather that the only advice which he had\ngiven to the young man was to cut his throat. The idle word had left\nno impression on Ralph Newton;--but still it had been spoken, and\nwas remembered by Sir Thomas. When he was left alone after the young\nman's departure he was very unhappy. It was not only that he had\nspoken a word so idle when he ought to have been grave and wise, but\nthat he felt that he had been altogether remiss in his duty as guide,\nphilosopher, and friend. There were old sorrows, too, on this score.\nIn the main Sir Thomas had discharged well a most troublesome,\nthankless, and profitless duty towards the son of a man who had not\nbeen related to him, and with whom an accidental intimacy had been\nripened into friendship by letter rather than by social intercourse.\nRalph Newton's father had been the younger brother of the present\nGregory Newton, of Newton Priory, and had been the parson of the\nparish of Peele Newton,--as was now Ralph's younger brother, Gregory.\nThe present squire of Newton had been never married, and the\nproperty, as has before been said, had been settled on Ralph, as the\nmale heir,--provided, of course, that his uncle left no legitimate\nson of his own. It had come to pass that the two brothers, Gregory\nand Ralph, had quarrelled about matters of property, and had not\nspoken for years before the death of the younger. Ralph at this time\nhad been just old enough to be brought into the quarrel. There had\nbeen questions of cutting timber and of leases, as to which the\nparson, acting on his son's behalf, had opposed the Squire with much\nunnecessary bitterness and suspicion. And it was doubtless the case\nthat the Squire resented bitterly an act done by his own father\nwith the view of perpetuating the property in the true line of the\nNewtons. For when the settlement was made on the marriage of the\nyounger brother, the elder was already the father of a child, whom\nhe loved none the less because that child's mother had not become\nhis wife. So the quarrel had been fostered, and at the time of the\nparson's death had extended itself to the young man who was his son,\nand the heir to the estate. When on his death-bed, the parson had\nasked Mr. Underwood, who had just then entered the House of Commons,\nto undertake this guardianship; and the lawyer, with many doubts,\nhad consented. He had striven, but striven in vain, to reconcile the\nuncle and nephew. And, indeed, he was ill-fitted to accomplish such\ntask. He could only write letters on the subject, which were very\nsensible but very cold;--in all of which he would be careful to\nexplain that the steps which had been taken in regard to the property\nwere in strict conformity with the law. The old Squire would have\nnothing to do with his heir,--in which resolution he was strengthened\nby the tidings which reached him of his heir's manner of living. He\nwas taught to believe that everything was going to the dogs with\nthe young man, and was wont to say that Newton Priory, with all its\nacres, would be found to have gone to the dogs too when his day was\ndone;--unless, indeed, Ralph should fortunately kill himself by drink\nor evil living, in which case the property would go to the younger\nGregory, the present parson. Now the present parson of Newton was his\nuncle's friend. Whether that friendship would have been continued had\nRalph died and the young clergyman become the heir, may be matter of\ndoubt.\n\nThis disagreeable duty of guardianship Sir Thomas had performed with\nmany scruples of conscience, and a determination to do his best;--and\nhe had nearly done it well. But he was a man who could not do it\naltogether well, let his scruples of conscience be what they might.\nHe had failed in obtaining a father's control over the young man;\nand even in regard to the property which had passed through his\nhands,--though he had been careful with it,--he had not been adroit.\nEven at this moment things had not been settled which should have\nbeen settled; and Sir Thomas had felt, when Ralph had spoken of\nselling all that remained to him and of paying his debts, that there\nwould be fresh trouble, and that he might be forced to own that he\nhad been himself deficient.\n\nAnd then he told himself,--and did so as soon as Ralph had left\nhim,--that he should have given some counsel to the young man when he\ncame to ask for it. \"You had better cut your throat!\" In his troubled\nspirit he had said that, and now his spirit was troubled the more\nbecause he had so spoken. He sat for hours thinking of it all. Ralph\nNewton was the undoubted heir to a very large property. He was now\nembarrassed,--but all his present debts did not amount to much\nmore than half one year's income of that property which would be\nhis,--probably in about ten years. The Squire might live for twenty\nyears, or might die to-morrow; but his life-interest in the estate,\naccording to the usual calculations, was not worth more than ten\nyears' purchase. Could he, Sir Thomas, have been right to tell a\nyoung man, whose prospects were so good, and whose debts, after all,\nwere so light, that he ought to go and cut his throat, as the only\nway of avoiding a disreputable marriage which would otherwise be\nforced upon him by the burden of his circumstances? Would not a\nguardian, with any true idea of his duty, would not a friend, whose\nfriendship was in any degree real, have found a way out of such\ndifficulties as these?\n\nAnd then as to the marriage itself,--the proposed marriage with the\nbreeches-maker's daughter,--the more Sir Thomas thought of it the\nmore distasteful did it become to him. He knew that Ralph was unaware\nof all the evil that would follow such a marriage;--relatives whose\nevery thought and action and word would be distasteful to him;\nchildren whose mother would not be a lady, and whose blood would\nbe polluted by an admixture so base;--and, worse still, a life's\ncompanion who would be deficient in all those attributes which such a\nman as Ralph Newton should look for in a wife. Sir Thomas was a man\nto magnify rather than lessen these evils. And now he allowed his\nfriend,--a man for whose behalf he had bound himself to use all the\nexercise of friendship,--to go from him with an idea that nothing\nbut suicide could prevent this marriage, simply because there was an\namount of debt, which, when compared with the man's prospects, should\nhardly have been regarded as a burden! As he thought of all this Sir\nThomas was very unhappy.\n\nRalph had left him at about ten o'clock, and he then sat brooding\nover his misery for about an hour. It was his custom when he remained\nin his chambers to tell his clerk, Stemm, between nine and ten that\nnothing more would be wanted. Then Stemm would go, and Sir Thomas\nwould sleep for a while in his chair. But the old clerk never stirred\ntill thus dismissed. It was now eleven, and Sir Thomas knew very well\nthat Stemm would be in his closet. He opened the door and called,\nand Stemm, aroused from his slumbers, slowly crept into the room.\n\"Joseph,\" said his master, \"I want Mr. Ralph's papers.\"\n\n\"To-night, Sir Thomas?\"\n\n\"Well;--yes, to-night. I ought to have told you when he went away,\nbut I was thinking of things.\"\n\n\"So I was thinking of things,\" said Stemm, as he very slowly made his\nway into the other room, and, climbing up a set of steps which stood\nthere, pulled down from an upper shelf a tin box,--and with it a\nworld of dust. \"If you'd have said before that they'd be wanted, Sir\nThomas, there wouldn't be such a deal of dry muck,\" said Stemm, as he\nput down the box on a chair opposite Sir Thomas's knees.\n\n\"And now where is the key?\" said Sir Thomas. Stemm shook his head\nvery slowly. \"You know, Stemm;--where is it?\"\n\n\"How am I to know, Sir Thomas? I don't know, Sir Thomas. It's like\nenough in one of those drawers.\" Then Stemm pointed to a certain\ntable, and after a while slowly followed his own finger. The drawer\nwas unlocked, and under various loose papers there lay four or five\nloose keys. \"Like enough it's one of these,\" said Stemm.\n\n\"Of course you knew where it was,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"I didn't know nothing at all about it,\" said Stemm, bobbing his head\nat his master, and making at the same time a gesture with his lips,\nwhereby he intended to signify that his master was making a fool of\nhimself. Stemm was hardly more than five feet high, and was a wizened\ndry old man, with a very old yellow wig. He delighted in scolding all\nthe world, and his special delight was in scolding his master. But\nagainst all the world he would take his master's part, and had no\ncare in the world except his master's comfort. When Sir Thomas passed\nan evening at Fulham, Stemm could do as he pleased with himself; but\nthey were blank evenings with Stemm when Sir Thomas was away. While\nSir Thomas was in the next room, he always felt that he was in\ncompany, but when Sir Thomas was away, all London, which was open to\nhim, offered him no occupation. \"That's the key,\" said Stemm, picking\nout one; \"but it wasn't I as put it there; and you didn't tell me\nas it was there, and I didn't know it was there. I guessed,--just\nbecause you do chuck things in there, Sir Thomas.\"\n\n\"What does it matter, Joseph?\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"It does matter when you say I knowed. I didn't know,--nor I couldn't\nknow. There's the key anyhow.\"\n\n\"You can go now, Joseph,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"Good night, Sir Thomas,\" said Stemm, retiring slowly, \"but I didn't\nknow, Sir Thomas,--nor I couldn't know.\" Then Sir Thomas unlocked the\nbox, and gradually surrounded himself with the papers which he took\nfrom it. It was past one o'clock before he again began to think what\nhe had better do to put Ralph Newton on his legs, and to save him\nfrom marrying the breeches-maker's daughter. He sat meditating on\nthat and other things as they came into his mind for over an hour,\nand then he wrote the following letter to old Mr. Newton. Very many\nyears had passed since he had seen Mr. Newton,--so many that the two\nmen would not have known each other had they met; but there had been\nan occasional correspondence between them, and they were presumed to\nbe on amicable terms with each other.\n\n\n   Southampton Buildings, 14th July, 186--.\n\n   DEAR SIR,--\n\n   I wish to consult you about the affairs of your heir and\n   my late ward, Ralph Newton. Of course I am aware of the\n   unfortunate misunderstanding which has hitherto separated\n   you from him, as to which I believe you will be willing to\n   allow that he, at least, has not been in fault. Though his\n   life has by no means been what his friends could have\n   wished it, he is a fine young fellow; and perhaps his\n   errors have arisen as much from his unfortunate position\n   as from any natural tendency to evil on his own part. He\n   has been brought up to great expectations, with the\n   immediate possession of a small fortune. These together\n   have taught him to think that a profession was unnecessary\n   for him, and he has been debarred from those occupations\n   which generally fall in the way of the heir to a large\n   landed property by the unfortunate fact of his entire\n   separation from the estate which will one day be his. Had\n   he been your son instead of your nephew, I think that his\n   life would have been prosperous and useful.\n\n   As it is, he has got into debt, and I fear that the\n   remains of his own property will not more than suffice to\n   free him from his liabilities. Of course he could raise\n   money on his interest in the Newton estate. Hitherto he\n   has not done so; and I am most anxious to save him from a\n   course so ruinous;--as you will be also, I am sure. He has\n   come to me for advice, and I grieve to say, has formed a\n   project of placing himself right again as regards money by\n   offering marriage to the daughter of a retail tradesman. I\n   have reason to believe that hitherto he has not committed\n   himself; but I think that the young woman's father would\n   accept the offer, if made. The money, I do not doubt,\n   would be forthcoming; but the result could not be\n   fortunate. He would then have allied himself with people\n   who are not fit to be his associates, and he would have\n   tied himself to a wife who, whatever may be her merits as\n   a woman, cannot be fit to be the mistress of Newton\n   Priory. But I have not known what advice to give him. I\n   have pointed out to him the miseries of such a match; and\n   I have also told him how surely his prospects for the\n   future would be ruined, were he to attempt to live on\n   money borrowed on the uncertain security of his future\n   inheritance. I have said so much as plainly as I know how\n   to say it;--but I have been unable to point out a third\n   course. I have not ventured to recommend him to make any\n   application to you.\n\n   It seems, however, to me, that I should be remiss in my\n   duty both to him and to you were I not to make you\n   acquainted with his circumstances,--so that you may\n   interfere, should you please to do so, either on his\n   behalf or on behalf of the property. Whatever offence\n   there may have been, I think there can have been none\n   personally from him to yourself. I beg you to believe that\n   I am far from being desirous to dictate to you, or to\n   point out to you this or that as your duty; but I venture\n   to think that you will be obliged to me for giving you\n   information which may lead to the protection of interests\n   which cannot but be dear to you. In conclusion, I will\n   only again say that Ralph himself is clever,\n   well-conditioned, and, as I most truly believe, a thorough\n   gentleman. Were the intercourse between you that of a\n   father and son, I think you would feel proud of the\n   relationship.\n\n   I remain, dear sir,\n   Very faithfully yours,\n\n   THOMAS UNDERWOOD.\n\n   Gregory Newton, Esq., Newton Priory.\n\n\nThis was written on Friday night, and was posted on the Saturday\nmorning by the faithful hand of Joseph Stemm;--who, however, did not\nhesitate to declare to himself, as he read the address, that his\nmaster was a fool for his pains. Stemm had never been favourable to\nthe cause of young Newton, and had considered from the first that Sir\nThomas should have declined the trust that had been imposed upon him.\nWhat good was to be expected from such a guardianship? And as things\nhad gone on, proving Stemm's prophecies as to young Newton's career\nto be true, that trusty clerk had not failed to remind his master of\nhis own misgivings. \"I told you so,\" had been repeated by Stemm over\nand over again, in more phrases than one, until the repetition had\nmade Sir Thomas very angry. Sir Thomas, when he gave the letter to\nStemm for posting, said not a word of the contents; but Stemm knew\nsomething of old Mr. Gregory Newton and the Newton Priory estate.\nStemm, moreover, could put two and two together. \"He's a fool for his\npains;--that's all,\" said Stemm, as he poked the letter into the box.\n\nDuring the whole of the next day the matter troubled Sir Thomas. What\nif Ralph should go at once to the breeches-maker's daughter,--the\nthought of whom made Sir Thomas very sick,--and commit himself before\nan answer should be received from Mr. Newton? It was only on Sunday\nthat an idea struck him that he might still do something further to\navoid the evil;--and with this object he despatched a note to Ralph,\nimploring him to wait for a few days before he would take any steps\ntowards the desperate remedy of matrimony. Then he begged Ralph to\ncall upon him again on the Wednesday morning. This note Ralph did not\nget till he went home on the Sunday evening;--at which time, as the\nreader knows, he had not as yet committed himself to the desperate\nremedy.\n\nOn the following Tuesday Sir Thomas received the following letter\nfrom Mr. Newton:--\n\n\n   Newton Priory, 17th July, 186--.\n\n   DEAR SIR,--\n\n   I have received your letter respecting Mr. Ralph Newton's\n   affairs, in regard to which, as far as they concern\n   himself, I am free to say that I do not feel much\n   interest. But you are quite right in your suggestion that\n   my solicitude in respect of the family property is very\n   great. I need not trouble you by pointing out the nature\n   of my solicitude, but may as well at once make an offer to\n   you, which you, as Mr. Ralph Newton's friend, and as an\n   experienced lawyer, can consider,--and communicate to him,\n   if you think right to do so.\n\n   It seems that he will be driven to raise money on his\n   interest in this property. I have always felt that he\n   would do so, and that from the habits of his life the\n   property would be squandered before it came into his\n   possession. Why should he not sell his reversion, and why\n   should I not buy it? I write in ignorance, but I presume\n   such an arrangement would be legal and honourable on my\n   part. The sum to be given would be named without\n   difficulty by an actuary. I am now fifty-five, and, I\n   believe, in good health. You yourself will probably know\n   within a few thousand pounds what would be the value of\n   the reversion. A proper person would, however, be of\n   course employed.\n\n   I have saved money, but by no means enough for such an\n   outlay as this. I would, however, mortgage the property or\n   sell one half of it, if by doing so I could redeem the\n   other half from Mr. Ralph Newton.\n\n   You no doubt will understand exactly the nature of my\n   offer, and will let me have an answer. I do not know that\n   I can in any other way expedite Mr. Ralph Newton's course\n   in life.\n\n   I am, dear sir,\n   Faithfully yours,\n\n   GREGORY NEWTON, Senior.\n\n\nWhen Sir Thomas read this he was almost in greater doubt and\ndifficulty than before. The measure proposed by the elder Newton was\nno doubt legal and honourable, but it could hardly be so carried\nout as to be efficacious. Ralph could only sell his share of the\ninheritance;--or rather his chance of inheriting the estate. Were he\nto die without a son before his uncle, then his brother would be the\nheir. The arrangement, however, if practicable, would at once make\nall things comfortable for Ralph, and would give him, probably, a\nlarge unembarrassed revenue,--so large, that the owner of it need\ncertainly have recourse to no discreditable marriage as the means of\nextricating himself from present calamity. But then Sir Thomas had\nvery strong ideas about a family property. Were Ralph's affairs,\nindeed, in such disorder as to make it necessary for him to abandon\nthe great prospect of being Newton of Newton? If the breeches-maker's\ntwenty thousand would suffice, surely the thing could be done on\ncheaper terms than those suggested by the old Squire,--and done\nwithout the intervention of Polly Neefit!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nNEWTON PRIORY.\n\n\nNewton Priory was at this time inhabited by two gentlemen,--old\nGregory Newton, who for miles round was known as the Squire; and his\nson, Ralph Newton,--his son, but not his heir; a son, however, whom\nhe loved as well as though he had been born with an undoubted right\nto inherit all those dearly-valued acres. A few lines will tell all\nthat need be told of the Squire's early life,--and indeed of his life\ndown to the present period. In very early days, immediately upon his\nleaving college, he had travelled abroad and had formed an attachment\nwith a German lady, who by him became the mother of a child. He\nintended to marry her, hoping to reconcile his father to the match;\nbut before either marriage or reconciliation could take place the\nyoung mother, whose babe's life could then only be counted by months,\nwas dead. In the hope that the old man might yield in all things,\nthe infant had been christened Ralph; for the old Squire's name was\nRalph, and there had been a Ralph among the Newtons since Newton\nPriory had existed. But the old Squire had a Ralph of his own,--the\nfather of our Ralph and of the present parson,--who in his time was\nrector of Peele Newton; and when the tidings of this foreign baby and\nof the proposed foreign marriage reached the old Squire,--then he\nurged his second son to marry, and made the settlement of the estate\nof which the reader has heard. The settlement was natural enough. It\nsimply entailed the property on the male heir of the family in the\nsecond generation. It deprived the eldest son of nothing that would\nbe his in accordance with the usual tenure of English primogeniture.\nHad he married and become the father of a family, his eldest son\nwould have been the heir. But heretofore there had been no such\nentails in the Newton family; or, at least, he was pleased to\nthink that there had been none such. And when he himself inherited\nthe property early in life,--before he had reached his thirtieth\nyear,--he thought that his father had injured him. His boy was as\ndear to him, as though the mother had been his honest wife. Then\nhe endeavoured to come to some terms with his brother. He would do\nanything in order that his child might be Newton of Newton after\nhim. But the parson would come to no terms at all, and was powerless\nto make any such terms as those which the elder brother required.\nThe parson was honest, self-denying, and proud on behalf of his own\nchildren; but he was intrusive in regard to the property, and apt to\nclaim privileges of interference beyond his right as the guardian of\nhis own or of his children's future interests. And so the brothers\nhad quarrelled;--and so the story of Newton Priory is told up to the\nperiod at which our story begins.\n\nGregory Newton and his son Ralph had lived together at the Priory for\nthe last six-and-twenty years, and the young man had grown up as a\nNewton within the knowledge of all the gentry around them. The story\nof his birth was public, and it was of course understood that he was\nnot the heir. His father had been too wise on the son's behalf to\nencourage any concealment. The son was very popular, and deserved to\nbe so; but it was known to all the young men round, and also to all\nthe maidens, that he would not be Newton of Newton. There had been\nno ill-contrived secret, sufficient to make a difficulty, but not\nsufficient to save the lad from the pains of his position. Everybody\nknew it; and yet it can hardly be said that he was treated otherwise\nthan he would have been treated had he been the heir. In the\nhunting-field there was no more popular man. A point had been\nstretched in his favour, and he was a magistrate. Mothers were kind\nto him, for it was known that his father loved him well, and that\nhis father had been a prudent man. In all respects he was treated\nas though he were the heir. He managed the shooting, and was the\ntrusted friend of all the tenants. Doubtless his father was the more\nindulgent to him because of the injury that had been done to him.\nAfter all, his life promised well as to material prosperity; for,\nthough the Squire, in writing to Sir Thomas, had spoken of selling\nhalf the property with the view of keeping the other half for his\nson, he was already possessed of means that would enable him to\nmake the proposed arrangement without such sacrifice as that. For\ntwenty-four years he had felt that he was bound to make a fortune for\nhis son out of his own income. And he had made a fortune, and mothers\nknew it, and everybody in the county was very civil to Ralph,--to\nthat Ralph who was not the heir.\n\nBut the Squire had never yet quite abandoned the hope that Ralph who\nwas not the heir might yet possess the place; and when he heard of\nhis nephew's doings, heard falsehood as well as truth, from day to\nday he built up new hopes. He had not expected any such overture as\nthat which had come from Sir Thomas; but if, as he did expect, Ralph\nthe heir should go to the Jews, why should not the Squire purchase\nthe Jews' interest in his own estate? Or, if Ralph the heir should,\nmore wisely, deal with some great money-lending office, why should\nnot he redeem the property through the same? Ralph the heir would\nsurely throw what interest he had into the market, and if so, that\ninterest might be bought by the person to whom it must be of more\nvalue than to any other. He had said little about it even to his\nson;--but he had hoped; and now had come this letter from Sir Thomas.\nThe reader knows the letter and the Squire's answer.\n\nThe Squire himself was a very handsome man, tall, broad-shouldered,\nsquare-faced, with hair and whiskers almost snow-white already, but\nwhich nevertheless gave to him but little sign of age. He was very\nstrong, and could sit in the saddle all day without fatigue. He was\ngiven much to farming, and thoroughly understood the duties of a\ncountry gentleman. He was hospitable, too; for, though money had been\nsaved, the Priory had ever been kept as one of the pleasantest houses\nin the county. There had been no wife, no child but the one, and no\nhouse in London. The stables, however, had been full of hunters: and\nit was generally said that no men in Hampshire were better mounted\nthan Gregory the father and Ralph the son. Of the father we will\nonly further say that he was a generous, passionate, persistent,\nvindictive, and unforgiving man, a bitter enemy and a staunch friend;\na thorough-going Tory, who, much as he loved England and Hampshire\nand Newton Priory, feared that they were all going to the dogs\nbecause of Mr. Disraeli and household suffrage; but who felt, in\nspite of those fears, that to make his son master of Newton Priory\nafter him would be the greatest glory of his life. He had sworn to\nthe young mother on her death-bed that the boy should be to him\nas though he had been born in wedlock. He had been as good as his\nword;--and we may say that he was one who had at least that virtue,\nthat he was always as good as his word.\n\nThe son was very like the father in face and gait and bearing,--so\nlike that the parentage was marked to the glance of any observer. He\nwas tall, as was his father, and broad across the chest, and strong\nand active, as his father had ever been. But his face was of a nobler\nstamp, bearing a surer impress of intellect, and in that respect\ntelling certainly the truth. This Ralph Newton had been educated\nabroad, his father, with a morbid feeling which he had since done\nmuch to conquer, having feared to send him among other young men,\nthe sons of squires and noblemen, who would have known that their\ncomrade was debarred by the disgrace of his birth from inheriting\nthe property of his father. But it may be doubted whether he had not\ngained as much as he had lost. German and French were the same to\nhim as his native tongue; and he returned to the life of an English\ncountry gentleman young enough to learn to ride to hounds, and to\nlive as he found others living around him.\n\nVery little was said, or indeed ever had been said, between the\nfather and son as to their relative position in reference to the\nproperty. Ralph,--the illegitimate Ralph,--knew well enough and had\nalways known, that the estate was not to be his. He had known this\nso long that he did not remember the day when he had not known it.\nOccasionally the Squire would observe with a curse that this or\nthat could not be done with the property,--such a house pulled down,\nor such another built, this copse grupped up, or those trees cut\ndown,--because of that reprobate up in London. As to pulling down,\nthere was no probability of interference now, though there had been\nmuch of such interference in the life of the old rector. \"Ralph,\"\nhe had once said to his brother the rector, \"I'll marry and have a\nfamily yet if there is another word about the timber.\" \"I have not\nthe slightest right or even wish to object to your doing so,\" said\nthe rector; \"but as long as things are on their present footing, I\nshall continue to do my duty.\" Soon after that it had come to pass\nthat the brothers so quarrelled that all intercourse between them was\nat an end. Such revenge, such absolute punishment as that which the\nSquire had threatened, would have been very pleasant to him;--but not\neven for such pleasure as that would he ruin the boy whom he loved.\nHe did not marry, but saved money, and dreamed of buying up the\nreversion of his nephew's interest.\n\nHis son was just two years older than our Ralph up in London, and\nhis father was desirous that he should marry. \"Your wife would be\nmistress of the house,--as long as I live, at least,\" he had once\nsaid. \"There are difficulties about it,\" said the son. Of course\nthere were difficulties. \"I do not know whether it is not better that\nI should remain unmarried,\" he said, a few minutes later. \"There are\nmen whom marriage does not seem to suit,--I mean as regards their\nposition.\" The father turned away, and groaned aloud when he was\nalone. On the evening of that day, as they were sitting together over\ntheir wine, the son alluded, not exactly to the same subject, but to\nthe thoughts which had arisen from it within his own mind. \"Father,\"\nhe said, \"I don't know whether it wouldn't be better for you to make\nit up with my cousin, and have him down here.\"\n\n\"What cousin?\" said the Squire, turning sharply round.\n\n\"With Gregory's eldest brother.\" The reader will perhaps remember\nthat the Gregory of that day was the parson. \"I believe he is a good\nfellow, and he has done you no harm.\"\n\n\"He has done me all harm.\"\n\n\"No; father; no. We cannot help ourselves, you know. Were he to die,\nGregory would be in the same position. It would be better that the\nfamily should be kept together.\"\n\n\"I would sooner have the devil here. No consideration on earth shall\ninduce me to allow him to put his foot upon this place. No;--not\nwhilst I live.\" The son said nothing further, and they sat together\nin silence for some quarter of an hour,--after which the elder of the\ntwo rose from his chair, and, coming round the table, put his hand\non the son's shoulder, and kissed his son's brow. \"Father,\" said\nthe young man, \"you think that I am troubled by things which hardly\ntouch me at all.\" \"By God, they touch me close enough!\" said the\nelder. This had taken place some month or two before the date of Sir\nThomas's letter;--but any reference to the matter of which they were\nboth no doubt always thinking was very rare between them.\n\nNewton Priory was a place which a father might well wish to leave\nunimpaired to his son. It lay in the north of Hampshire, where that\ncounty is joined to Berkshire; and perhaps in England there is no\nprettier district, no country in which moorland and woodland and\npasture are more daintily thrown together to please the eye, in which\nthere is a sweeter air, or a more thorough seeming of English wealth\nand English beauty and English comfort. Those who know Eversley and\nBramshill and Heckfield and Strathfieldsaye will acknowledge that\nit is so. But then how few are the Englishmen who travel to see the\nbeauties of their own country! Newton Priory, or Newton Peele as the\nparish was called, lay somewhat west of these places, but was as\ncharming as any of them. The entire parish belonged to Mr. Newton, as\ndid portions of three or four parishes adjoining. The house itself\nwas neither large nor remarkable for its architecture;--but it was\ncomfortable. The rooms indeed were low, for it had been built in the\nungainly days of Queen Anne, with additions in the equally ungainly\ntime of George II., and the passages were long and narrow, and the\nbedrooms were up and down stairs, as though pains had been taken\nthat no two should be on a level; and the windows were of ugly shape,\nand the whole mass was uncouth and formless,--partaking neither of\nthe Gothic beauty of the Stuart architecture, nor of the palatial\ngrandeur which has sprung up in our days; and it stood low, giving\nbut little view from the windows. But, nevertheless, there was a\nfamily comfort and a warm solidity about the house, which endeared it\nto those who knew it well. There had been a time in which the present\nSquire had thought of building for himself an entirely new house, on\nanother site,--on the rising brow of a hill, some quarter of a mile\naway from his present residence;--but he had remembered that as\nhe could not leave his estate to his son, it behoved him to spend\nnothing on the property which duty did not demand from him.\n\nThe house stood in a park of some two hundred acres, in which the\nground was poor, indeed, but beautifully diversified by rising knolls\nand little ravines, which seemed to make the space almost unlimited.\nAnd then the pines which waved in the Newton woods sighed and moaned\nwith a melody which, in the ears of their owner, was equalled by\nthat of no other fir trees in the world. And the broom was yellower\nat Newton than elsewhere, and more plentiful; and the heather was\nsweeter;--and wild thyme on the grass more fragrant. So at least Mr.\nNewton was always ready to swear. And all this he could not leave\nbehind him to his son;--but must die with the knowledge, that as soon\nas the breath was out of his body, it would become the property of\na young man whom he hated! He might not cut down the pine woods, nor\ndisturb those venerable single trees which were the glory of his\npark;--but there were moments in which he thought that he could take\na delight in ploughing up the furze, and in stripping the hill-sides\nof the heather. Why should his estate be so beautiful for one who was\nnothing to him? Would it not be well that he should sell everything\nthat was saleable in order that his own son might be the richer?\n\nOn the day after he had written his reply to Sir Thomas he was\nrambling in the evening with his son through the woods. Nothing could\nbe more beautiful than the park was now;--and Ralph had been speaking\nof the glory of the place. But something had occurred to make his\nfather revert to the condition of a certain tenant, whose holding on\nthe property was by no means satisfactory either to himself or to his\nlandlord. \"You know, sir,\" said the son, \"I told you last year that\nDarvell would have to go.\"\n\n\"Where's he to go to?\"\n\n\"He'll go to the workhouse if he stays here. It will be much better\nfor him to be bought out while there is still something left for him\nto sell. Nothing can be worse than a man sticking on to land without\na shilling of capital.\"\n\n\"Of course it's bad. His father did very well there.\"\n\n\"His father did very well there till he took to drink and died of it.\nYou know where the road parts Darvell's farm and Brownriggs? Just\nlook at the difference of the crops. There's a place with wheat on\neach side of you. I was looking at them before dinner.\"\n\n\"Brownriggs is in a different parish. Brownriggs is in Bostock.\"\n\n\"But the land is of the same quality. Of course Walker is a different\nsort of man from Darvell. I believe there are nearly four hundred\nacres in Brownriggs.\"\n\n\"All that,\" said the father.\n\n\"And Darvell has about seventy;--but the land should be made to bear\nthe same produce per acre.\"\n\nThe Squire paused a moment, and then asked a question. \"What should\nyou say if I proposed to sell Brownriggs?\" Now there were two or\nthree matters which made the proposition to sell Brownriggs a very\nwonderful proposition to come from the Squire. In the first place he\ncouldn't sell an acre of the property at all,--of which fact his son\nwas very well aware; and then, of all the farms on the estate it was,\nperhaps, the best and most prosperous. Mr. Walker, the tenant, was a\nman in very good circumstances, who hunted, and was popular, and was\njust the man of whose tenancy no landlord would be ashamed.\n\n\n[Illustration: \"What should you say if I proposed to sell\nBrownriggs?\"]\n\n\n\"Sell Brownriggs!\" said the young man. \"Well, yes; I should be\nsurprised. Could you sell it?\"\n\n\"Not at present,\" said the Squire.\n\n\"How could it be sold at all?\" They were now standing at a gate\nleading out of the park into a field held by the Squire in his own\nhands, and were both leaning on it. \"Father,\" said the son, \"I wish\nyou would not trouble yourself about the estate, but let things come\nand go just as they have been arranged.\"\n\n\"I prefer to arrange them for myself,--if I can. It comes to this,\nthat it may be possible to buy the reversion of the property. I could\nnot buy it all;--or if I did, must sell a portion of it to raise the\nmoney. I have been thinking it over and making calculations. If we\nlet Walker's farm go, and Ingram's, I think I could manage the rest.\nOf course it would depend on the value of my own life.\"\n\nThere was a long pause, during which they both were still leaning on\nthe gate. \"It is a phantom, sir!\" the young man said at last.\n\n\"What do you mean by a phantom? I don't see any phantom. A reversion\ncan be bought and sold as well as any other property. And if it be\nsold in this case, I am as free to buy it as any other man.\"\n\n\"Who says it is to be sold, sir?\"\n\n\"I say so. That prig of a barrister, Sir Thomas Underwood, has\nalready made overtures to me to do something for that young scoundrel\nin London. He is a scoundrel, for he is spending money that is not\nhis own. And he is now about to make a marriage that will disgrace\nhis family.\" The Squire probably did not at the moment think of the\ndisgrace which he had brought upon the family by not marrying. \"The\nfact is, that he will have to sell all that he can sell. Why should I\nnot buy it!\"\n\n\"If he were to die?\" suggested the son.\n\n\"I wish he would,\" said the father.\n\n\"Don't say that, sir. But if he were to die, Gregory here, who is as\ngood a fellow as ever lived, would come into his shoes. Ralph could\nsell no more than his own chance.\"\n\n\"We could get Gregory to join us,\" said the energetic Squire. \"He,\nalso, could sell his right.\"\n\n\"You had better leave it as it is, sir,\" said the son, after another\npause. \"I feel sure that you will only get yourself into trouble. The\nplace is yours as long as you live, and you should enjoy it.\"\n\n\"And know that it is going to the Jews after me! Not if I can help\nit. You won't marry, as things are; but you'd marry quick enough if\nyou knew you would remain here after my death;--if you were sure that\na child of yours could inherit the estate. I mean to try it on, and\nit is best that you should know. Whatever he can make over to the\nJews he can make over to me;--and as that is what he is about, I\nshall keep my eyes open. I shall go up to London about it and see\nCarey next week. A man can do a deal if he sets himself thoroughly to\nwork.\"\n\n\"I'd leave it alone if I were you,\" said the young man.\n\n\"I shall not leave it alone. I mayn't be able to get it all, but I'll\ndo my best to secure a part of it. If any is to go, it had better\nbe the land in Bostock and Twining. I think we could manage to keep\nNewton entire.\"\n\nHis mind was always on the subject, though it was not often that he\nsaid a word about it to the son in whose behalf he was so anxious.\nHis thoughts were always dwelling on it, so that the whole peace and\ncomfort of his life were disturbed. A life-interest in a property\nis, perhaps, as much as a man desires to have when he for whose\nprotection he is debarred from further privileges of ownership is\na well-loved son;--but an entail that limits an owner's rights on\nbehalf of an heir who is not loved, who is looked upon as an enemy,\nis very grievous. And in this case the man who was so limited,\nso cramped, so hedged in, and robbed of the true pleasures of\nownership, had a son with whom he would have been willing to share\neverything,--whom it would have been his delight to consult as to\nevery roof to be built, every tree to be cut, every lease to be\ngranted or denied. He would dream of telling his son, with a certain\nluxury of self-abnegation, that this or that question as to the\nestate should be settled in the interest, not of the setting, but of\nthe rising sun. \"It is your affair rather than mine, my boy;--do as\nyou like.\" He could picture to himself in his imagination a pleasant,\nhalf-mock melancholy in saying such things, and in sharing the reins\nof government between his own hands and those of his heir. As the\nsun is falling in the heavens and the evening lights come on, this\nworld's wealth and prosperity afford no pleasure equal to this. It\nis this delight that enables a man to feel, up to the last moment,\nthat the goods of the world are good. But of all this he was to be\nrobbed,--in spite of all his prudence. It might perhaps sometimes\noccur to him that he by his own vice had brought this scourge upon\nhis back;--but not the less on that account did it cause him to rebel\nagainst the rod. Then there would come upon him the idea that he\nmight cure this evil were his energy sufficient;--and all that he\nheard of that nephew and heir, whom he hated, tended to make him\nthink that the cure was within his reach. There had been moments\nin which he had planned a scheme of leading on that reprobate into\nquicker and deeper destruction, of a pretended friendship with the\nspendthrift, in order that money for speedier ruin might be lent on\nthat security which the uncle himself was so anxious to possess as\nhis very own. But the scheme of this iniquity, though it had been\nplanned and mapped out in his brain, had never been entertained as\na thing really to be done. There are few of us who have not allowed\nour thoughts to work on this or that villany, arranging the method of\nits performance, though the performance itself is far enough from our\npurpose. The amusement is not without its danger,--and to the Squire\nof Newton had so far been injurious that it had tended to foster his\nhatred. He would, however, do nothing that was dishonest,--nothing\nthat the world would condemn,--nothing that would not bear the light.\nThe argument to which he mainly trusted was this,--that if Ralph\nNewton, the heir, had anything to sell and was pleased to sell it,\nit was as open to him to buy it as to any other. If the reversion of\nthe estate of Newton Priory was in the market, why should he not buy\nit?--the reversion or any part of the reversion? If such were the\ncase he certainly would buy it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nMRS. BROWNLOW.\n\n\nThere was a certain old Mrs. Brownlow, who inhabited a large\nold-fashioned house on the Fulham Road, just beyond the fashionable\nconfines of Brompton, but nearer to town than the decidedly rural\ndistrict of Walham Green and Parson's Green. She was deeply\ninterested in the welfare of the Underwood girls, having been a first\ncousin of their paternal grandmother, and was very unhappy because\ntheir father would not go home and take care of them. She was an\nexcellent old woman, affectionate, charitable, and religious; but\nshe was rather behindhand in general matters, and did not clearly\nunderstand much about anything in these latter days. She had heard\nthat Sir Thomas was accustomed to live away from his daughters, and\nthought it very shocking;--but she knew that Sir Thomas either was\nor had been in Parliament, and that he was a great lawyer and a\nvery clever man, and therefore she made excuses. She did not quite\nunderstand it all, but she thought it expedient to befriend the young\nladies. She had heard, too, that Ralph Newton, who had been entrusted\nto the care of Sir Thomas, was heir to an enormous property; and she\nthought that the young man ought to marry one of the young ladies.\nConsequently, whenever she would ask her cousins to tea, she would\nalso ask Mr. Ralph Newton. Sometimes he would come. More frequently\nhe would express his deep regret that a previous engagement prevented\nhim from having the pleasure of accepting Mrs. Brownlow's kind\ninvitation. On all these occasions Mrs. Brownlow invited Sir\nThomas;--but Sir Thomas never came. It could hardly have been\nexpected of him that he should do so. Bolsover House was the\nold-fashioned name of Mrs. Brownlow's residence; and an invitation\nfor tea had been sent for a certain Tuesday in July,--Tuesday, July\nthe 18th. Mrs. Brownlow had of course been informed of the arrival\nof Mary Bonner,--who was in truth as nearly related to her as the\nUnderwood girls,--and the invitation was given with the express\nintention of doing honour to Mary. By the young ladies from Popham\nVilla the invitation was accepted as a matter of course.\n\n\"Will he be there?\" Clary said to her sister.\n\n\"I hope not, Clarissa.\"\n\n\"Why do you hope not? We are not to quarrel; are we, Patty?\"\n\n\"No;--we need not quarrel. But I am afraid of him. He is not good\nenough, Clary, for you to be unhappy about him. And I fear,--I fear,\nhe is--\"\n\n\"Is what, Patty? Do speak it out. There is nothing I hate so much as\na mystery.\"\n\n\"I fear he is not genuine;--what people call honest. He would say\nthings without quite meaning what he says.\"\n\n\"I don't think it. I am sure he is not like that. I may have been a\nfool--\" Then she stopped herself, remembering the whole scene on the\nlawn. Alas;--there had been no misunderstanding him. The crime had\nbeen forgiven; but the crime had been a great fact. Since that she\nhad seen him only once, and then he had been so cold! But yet as he\nleft her he had not been quite cold. Surely that pressure of her hand\nhad meant something;--had meant something after that great crime! But\nwhy did he not come to her; or why,--which would have been so far,\nfar better,--did he not go to her papa and tell everything to him?\nNow, however, there was the chance that she would see him at Bolsover\nHouse. That Mrs. Brownlow would ask him was quite a matter of course.\n\nThe great event of the evening was to be the introduction of Mrs.\nBrownlow to the new cousin. They were to drink tea out in the\nold-fashioned garden behind the house, from which Mrs. Brownlow could\nretreat into her own room at the first touch of a breath of air. The\nday was one of which the world at large would declare that there was\nno breath of air, morning, noon, or night. There was to be quite a\nparty. That was evident from the first to our young ladies, who knew\nthe ways of the house, and who saw that the maids were very smart,\nand that an extra young woman had been brought in; but they were the\nfirst to come,--as was proper.\n\n\"My dear Mary,\" said the old woman to her new guest, \"I am glad to\nsee you. I knew your mother and loved her well. I hope you will be\nhappy, my dear.\" Mrs. Brownlow was a very little old woman, very\npretty, very grey, very nicely dressed, and just a little deaf. Mary\nBonner kissed her, and murmured some word of thanks. The old woman\nstood for a few seconds, looking at the beauty,--astounded like the\nrest of the world. \"Somebody told me she was good-looking,\" Mrs.\nBrownlow said to Patience;--\"but I did not expect to see her like\nthat.\"\n\n\"Is she not lovely?\"\n\n\"She is a miracle, my dear! I hope she won't steal all the nice\nyoung men away from you and your sister, eh? Yes;--yes. What does Mr.\nNewton say to her?\" Patience, however, knew that she need not answer\nall the questions which Mrs. Brownlow asked, and she left this\nquestion unanswered.\n\nTwo or three elderly ladies came in, and four or five young ladies,\nand an old gentleman who sat close to Mrs. Brownlow and squeezed her\nhand very often, and a middle-aged gentleman who was exceedingly\nfunny, and two young gentlemen who carried the tea and cakes about,\nbut did not talk much. Such were the guests, and the young ladies,\nwho no doubt were accustomed to Mrs. Brownlow's parties, took it all\nas it was intended, and were not discontented. There was one young\nlady, however, who longed to ask a question, but durst not. Had Ralph\nNewton promised that he would come? Clary was sitting between the\nold gentleman who seemed to be so fond of Mrs. Brownlow's hand and\nher cousin Mary. She said not a word,--nor, indeed, was there much\ntalking among the guests in general. The merry, middle-aged gentleman\ndid the talking, combining with it a good deal of exhilarating\nlaughter at his own wit. The ladies sat round, and sipped their tea\nand smiled. That middle-aged gentleman certainly earned his mild\nrefreshment;--for the party without him must have been very dull.\nThen there came a breath of air,--or, as Mrs. Brownlow called it, a\nkeen north wind; and the old lady retreated into the house. \"Don't\nlet me take anybody else in,--only I can't stand a wind like that.\"\nThe old gentleman accompanied her, and then the elderly ladies. The\nyoung ladies came next, and the man of wit, with the silent young\ngentlemen, followed, laden with scarfs, parasols, fans, and stray\nteacups. \"I don't think we used to have such cold winds in July,\"\nsaid Mrs. Brownlow. The old gentleman pressed her hand once more, and\nwhispered into her ear that there had certainly been a great change.\n\nSuddenly Ralph Newton was among them. Clarissa had not heard him\nannounced, and to her it seemed as though he had come down from\nthe heavens,--as would have befitted his godship. He was a great\nfavourite with Mrs. Brownlow, who, having heard that he was heir\nto a very large property, thought that his extravagance became him.\nAccording to her views it was his duty to spend a good deal of money,\nand his duty also to marry Clarissa Underwood. As he was as yet\nunmarried to any one else, she hardly doubted that he would do his\nduty. She was a sanguine old lady, who always believed that things\nwould go right. She bustled and fussed on the present occasion\nwith the very evident intention of getting a seat for him next to\nClarissa; but Clarissa was as active in avoiding such an arrangement,\nand Ralph soon found himself placed between Mary Bonner and a very\ndeaf old lady, who was always present at Mrs. Brownlow's tea-parties.\n\"I suppose this has all been got up in your honour,\" he said to Mary.\nShe smiled, and shook her head. \"Oh, but it has. I know the dear old\nlady's ways so well! She would never allow a new Underwood to be at\nthe villa for a month without having a tea-party to consecrate the\nevent.\"\n\n\"Isn't she charming, Mr. Newton;--and so pretty?\"\n\n\"No end of charming, and awfully pretty. Why are we all in here\ninstead of out in the garden?\"\n\n\"Mrs. Brownlow thought that it was cold.\"\n\n\"With the thermometer at 80\u00c2\u00b0! What do you think, who ought to know\nwhat hot weather means? Are you chilly?\"\n\n\"Not in the least. We West Indians never find this climate cold\nthe first year. Next year I don't doubt that I shall be full of\nrheumatism all over, and begging to be taken back to the islands.\"\n\nClarissa watched them from over the way as though every word spoken\nbetween them had been a treason to herself. And yet she had almost\nbeen rude to old Mrs. Brownlow in the manner in which she had placed\nherself on one side of the circle when the old lady had begged her to\nsit on the other. Certainly, had she heard all that was said between\nher lover and her cousin, there was nothing in the words to offend\nher. She did not hear them; but she could see that Ralph looked into\nMary's beautiful face, and that Mary smiled in a demure, silent,\nself-assured way which was already becoming odious to Clarissa.\nClarissa herself, when Ralph looked into her face, would blush and\nturn away, and feel herself unable to bear the gaze of the god.\n\nIn a few minutes there came to be a sudden move, and all the young\npeople trooped back into the garden. It was Ralph Newton who did\nit, and nobody quite understood how it was done. \"Certainly, my\ndears; certainly,\" said the old lady. \"I dare say the moon is very\nbeautiful. Yes; I see Mr. Ralph. You are not going to take me out,\nI can tell you. The moon is all very well, but I like to see it\nthrough the window. Don't mind me. Mr. Truepeny will stay with me.\"\nMr. Truepeny, who was turned eighty, put out his hand and patted Mrs.\nBrownlow's arm, and assured her that he wanted nothing better than\nto stay with her for ever. The witty gentleman did not like the move,\nbecause it had been brought about by a newcomer, who had, as it were,\ntaken the wind out of his sails. He lingered awhile, hoping to have\nweight enough to control the multitude;--in which he failed, and at\nlast made one of the followers. And Clarissa lingered also, because\nRalph had been the first to stir. Ralph had gone out with Mary\nBonner, and therefore Clarissa had held back. So it came to pass\nthat she found herself walking round the garden with the witty,\nexhilarating, middle-aged gentleman,--whom, for the present at least,\nshe most cordially hated. \"I am not quite sure that our dear old\nfriend isn't right,\" said the witty man, whose name was Poojean;--\"a\nchair to sit down upon, and a wall or two around one, and a few\nlittle knick-nacks about,--carpets and tables and those sort of\nthings,--are comfortable at times.\"\n\n\"I wonder you should leave them then,\" said Clarissa.\n\n\"Can there be a wonder that I leave them with such temptation as\nthis,\" said the gallant Poojean. Clarissa hated him worse than ever,\nand would not look at him, or even make the faintest sign that she\nheard him. The voice of Ralph Newton through the trees struck her\nears; and yet the voice wasn't loud,--as it would not be if it were\naddressed with tenderness to Mary. And there was she bound by some\nindissoluble knot to,--Mr. Poojean. \"That Mr. Newton is a friend of\nyours?\" asked Mr. Poojean.\n\n\"Yes;--a friend of ours,\" said Clarissa.\n\n\"Then I will express my intense admiration for his wit, general\ncharacter, and personal appearance. Had he been a stranger to you, I\nshould, of course, have insinuated an opinion that he was a fool, a\ncoxcomb, and the very plainest young man I had ever seen. That is the\nway of the world,--isn't it, Miss Underwood?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Clarissa.\n\n\"Oh, yes,--you do. That's the way we all go on. As he is your friend,\nI can't dare to begin to abuse him till after the third time round\nthe garden.\"\n\n\"I beg, then, that there may be only two turns,\" said Clarissa.\nBut she did not know how to stop, or to get rid of her abominable\ncompanion.\n\n\"If I mustn't abuse him after three turns, he must be a favourite,\"\nsaid the persevering Poojean. \"I suppose he is a favourite.\nBy-the-bye, what a lovely girl that is with whom your favourite\nwas,--shall I say flirting?\"\n\n\"That lady is my cousin, Mr. Poojean.\"\n\n\"I didn't say that she was flirting, mind. I wouldn't hint such a\nthing of any young lady, let her be anybody's cousin. Young ladies\nnever flirt. But young men do sometimes;--don't they? After all, it\nis the best fun going;--isn't it?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Clarissa. By this time they had got round to the\nsteps leading from the garden to the house. \"I think I'll go in, Mr.\nPoojean.\" She did go in, and Mr. Poojean was left looking at the moon\nall alone, as though he had separated himself from all mirth and\nsociety for that melancholy but pleasing occupation. He stood there\ngazing upwards with his thumbs beneath his waistcoat. \"Grand,--is it\nnot?\" he said to the first couple that passed him.\n\n\"Awfully grand, and beautifully soft, and all the rest of it,\" said\nRalph, as he went on with Mary Bonner by his side.\n\n\"That fellow has got no touch of poetry in him!\" said Poojean to\nhimself. In the meantime Clarissa, pausing a moment as she entered\nthrough the open window, heard Ralph's cheery voice. How well she\nknew its tones! And she still paused, with ears erect, striving to\ncatch some word from her cousin's mouth. But Mary's words, if they\nwere words spoken by her, were too low and soft to be caught.\n\"Oh,--if she should turn out to be sly!\" Clarissa said to herself.\nWas it true that Ralph had been flirting with her,--as that odious\nman had said? And why, why, why had Ralph not come to her, if he\nreally loved her, as he had twice told her that he did? Of course\nshe had not thrown herself into his arms when old Mrs. Brownlow made\nthat foolish fuss. But still he might have come to her. He might\nhave waited for her in the garden. He might have saved her from the\n\"odious vulgarity\" of that \"abominable old wretch.\" For in such\nlanguage did Clarissa describe to herself the exertions to amuse her\nwhich had been made by her late companion. But had the Sydney Smith\nof the day been talking to her, he would have been dull, or the Count\nD'Orsay of the day, he would have been vulgar, while the sound of\nRalph Newton's voice, as he walked with another girl, was reaching\nher ears. And then, before she had seated herself in Mrs. Brownlow's\ndrawing-room, another idea had struck her. Could it be that Ralph did\nnot come to her because she had told him that she would never forgive\nhim for that crime? Was it possible that his own shame was so great\nthat he was afraid of her? If so, could she not let him know that he\nwas,--well, forgiven? Poor Clarissa! In the meantime the voices still\ncame to her from the garden, and she still thought that she could\ndistinguish Ralph's low murmurings.\n\nIt may be feared that Ralph had no such deep sense of his fault as\nthat suggested. He did remember well enough,--had reflected more\nthan once or twice,--on those words which he had spoken to Clary.\nHaving spoken them he had felt his crime to be their not unnatural\naccompaniment. At that moment, when he was on the lawn at Fulham, he\nhad thought that it would be very sweet to devote himself to dear\nClary,--that Clary was the best and prettiest girl he knew, that, in\nshort, it might be well for him to love her and cherish her and make\nher his wife. Had not Patience come upon the scene, and disturbed\nthem, he would probably then and there have offered to her his hand\nand heart. But Patience had come upon the scene, and the offer had\nnot been, as he thought, made. Since all that, which had passed ages\nago,--weeks and weeks ago,--there had fallen upon him the prosaic\nromance of Polly Neefit. He had actually gone down to Hendon to offer\nhimself as a husband to the breeches-maker's daughter. It is true he\nhad hitherto escaped in that quarter also,--or, at any rate, had not\nas yet committed himself. But the train of incidents and thoughts\nwhich had induced him to think seriously of marrying Polly, had\nmade him aware that he could not propose marriage to Sir Thomas\nUnderwood's daughter. From such delight as that he found, on calm\nreflection, that he had debarred himself by the folly of his past\nlife. It was well that Patience had come upon the scene.\n\nSuch being the state of affairs with him, that little episode with\nClary being at an end,--or rather, as he thought, never having quite\ncome to a beginning,--and his little arrangement as to Polly Neefit\nbeing in abeyance, he was free to amuse himself with this newcomer.\nMiss Bonner was certainly the most lovely girl he had ever seen. He\ncould imagine no beauty to exceed hers. He knew well enough that her\nloveliness could be nothing to him;--but a woman's beauty is in one\nsense as free as the air in all Christian countries. It is a light\nshed for the delight, not of one, but of many. There could be no\nreason why he should not be among the admirers of Miss Bonner.\n\"I expect, you know, to be admitted quite on the terms of an old\nfriend,\" he said. \"I shall call you Mary, and all that kind of\nthing.\"\n\n\"I don't see your claim,\" said Miss Bonner.\n\n\"Oh yes, you do,--and must allow it. I was almost a sort of son of\nSir Thomas's,--till he turned me off when I came of age. And Patience\nand Clarissa are just the same as sisters to me.\"\n\n\"You are not even a cousin, Mr. Newton.\"\n\n\"No;--I'm not a cousin. It's more like a foster-brother, you know. Of\ncourse I shan't call you Mary if you tell me not. How is it to be?\"\n\n\"Just for the present I'll be Miss Bonner.\"\n\n\"For a week or so?\"\n\n\"Say for a couple of years, and then we'll see how it is.\"\n\n\"You'll be some lucky's fellow's wife long before that. Do you like\nliving at Fulham?\"\n\n\"Very much. How should I not like it? They are so kind to me. And you\nknow, when I first resolved to come home, I thought I should have\nto go out as a governess,--or, perhaps, as a nursery-maid, if they\ndidn't think me clever enough to teach. I did not expect my uncle to\nbe so good to me. I had never seen him, you know. Is it not odd that\nmy uncle is so little at home?\"\n\n\"It is odd. He is writing a book, you see, and he finds that the air\nof Fulham doesn't suit his brains.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Newton!\"\n\n\"And he likes to be quite alone. There isn't a better fellow going\nthan your uncle. I am sure I ought to say so. But he isn't just what\nI should call,--sociable.\"\n\n\"I think him almost perfection;--but I do wish he was more at home\nfor their sakes. We'll go in now, Mr. Newton. Patience has gone in,\nand I haven't seen Clarissa for ever so long.\"\n\nSoon after this the guests began to go away. Mr. Truepeny gave Mrs.\nBrownlow's hand the last squeeze, and Mr. Poojean remarked that\nall terrestrial joys must have an end. \"Not but that such hours as\nthese,\" said he, \"have about them a dash of the celestial which\nalmost gives them a claim to eternity.\" \"Horrible fool!\" said\nClarissa to her sister, who was standing close to her.\n\n\"Mrs. Brownlow would, perhaps, prefer going to bed,\" said Ralph.\nThen every one was gone except the Underwoods and Ralph Newton. The\ngirls had on their hats and shawls, and all was prepared for their\ndeparture;--but there was some difficulty about the fly. The Fulham\nfly which had brought them, and which always took them everywhere,\nhad hitherto omitted to return for them. It was ordered for half-past\nten, and now it was eleven. \"Are you sure he was told?\" said Clary.\nPatience had told him herself,--twice. \"Then he must be tipsy again,\"\nsaid Clary. Mrs. Brownlow bade them to sit still and wait; but when\nthe fly did not arrive by half-past eleven, it was necessary that\nsomething should be done. There were omnibuses on the road, but they\nmight probably be full. \"It is only two miles,--let us walk,\" said\nClary; and so it was decided.\n\nRalph insisted on walking with them till he should meet an omnibus or\na cab to take him back to London. Patience did her best to save him\nfrom such labour, protesting that they would want no such escort. But\nhe would not be gainsayed, and would go with them at least a part\nof the way. Of course he did not leave them till they had reached\nthe gate of Popham Villa. But when they were starting there arose a\ndifficulty as to the order in which they would marshal themselves;--a\ndifficulty as to which not a word could be spoken, but which was not\nthe less a difficulty. Clarissa hung back. Ralph had spoken hardly a\nword to her all the evening. It had better continue so. She was sure\nthat he could not care for her. But she thought that she would be\nbetter contented that he should walk with Patience than with Mary\nBonner. But Mary took the matter into her own hands, and started off\nboldly with Patience. Patience hardly approved, but there would be\nnothing so bad as seeming to disapprove. Clary's heart was in her\nmouth as she found her arm within his. He had contrived that it\nshould be so, and she could not refuse. Her mind was changed again\nnow, and once more she wished that she could let him know that the\ncrime was forgiven.\n\n\"I am so glad to have a word with you at last,\" he said. \"How do you\nget on with the new cousin?\"\n\n\"Very well;--and how have you got on with her?\"\n\n\"You must ask her that. She is very beautiful,--what I call\nwonderfully beautiful.\"\n\n\"Indeed she is,\" said Clary, withdrawing almost altogether the weight\nof her hand from his arm.\n\n\"And clever, too,--very clever; but--\"\n\n\"But what?\" asked Clary, and the softest, gentlest half-ounce of\npressure was restored.\n\n\"Well;--nothing. I like her uncommonly;--but is she not\nquite,--quite,--quite--\"\n\n\"She is quite everything that she ought to be, Ralph.\"\n\n\"I'm sure of that;--an angel, you know, and all the rest of it. But\nangels are cold, you know. I don't know that I ever admired a girl\nso much in my life.\" The pressure was again lessened,--all but\nannihilated. \"But, somehow, I should never dream of falling in love\nwith your cousin.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you may do so without dreaming,\" said Clary, as\nunconsciously she gave back the weight to her hand.\n\n\"No;--I know very well the sort of girl that makes me spoony.\" This\nwas not very encouraging to poor Clary, but still she presumed that\nhe meant to imply that she herself was a girl of the sort that so\nacted upon him. And the conversation went on in this way throughout\nthe walk. There was not much encouragement to her, and certainly she\ndid not say a word to him that could make him feel that she wanted\nencouragement. But still he had been with her, and she had been\nhappy; and when they parted at the gate, and he again pressed her\nhand, she thought that things had gone well. \"He must know that I\nhave forgiven him now!\" she said to herself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nMR. NEEFIT IS DISTURBED.\n\n\nOn the morning following Mrs. Brownlow's little tea-party Ralph\nNewton was bound by appointment to call upon Sir Thomas. But before\nhe started on that duty a certain friend of his called upon him.\nThis friend was Mr. Neefit. But before the necessary account of Mr.\nNeefit's mission is given, the reader must be made acquainted with a\nfew circumstances as they had occurred at Hendon.\n\nIt will be remembered perhaps that on the Sunday evening the two\nrivals left the cottage at the same moment, one taking the road to\nthe right, and the other that to the left,--so that bloodshed, for\nthat occasion at least, was prevented. \"Neefit,\" said his wife to\nhim when they were alone together, \"you'll be getting yourself into\ntrouble.\" \"You be blowed,\" said Neefit. He was very angry with his\nwife, and was considering what steps he would take to maintain his\nproper marital and parental authority. He was not going to give way\nto the weaker vessel in a matter of such paramount importance, as to\nbe made a fool of in his own family. He was quite sure of this, while\nthe strength of the port wine still stood to him; and though he was\nsomewhat more troubled in spirit when his wife began to bully him\non the next morning, he still had valour enough to say that Ontario\nMoggs also might be--blowed.\n\nOn the Monday, when he returned home and asked for Polly, he found\nthat Polly was out walking. Mrs. Neefit did not at once tell him\nthat Moggs was walking with her, but such was the fact. Just at five\no'clock Moggs had presented himself at the cottage,--knowing very\nwell, sly dog that he was, the breeches-maker's hour of return, which\ntook place always precisely at four minutes past six,--and boldly\ndemanded an interview with Polly. \"I should like to hear what she's\ngot to say to me,\" said he, looking boldly, almost savagely, into\nMrs. Neefit's face. According to that matron's ideas this was the\nproper way in which maidens should be wooed and won; and, though\nPolly had at first declared that she had nothing at all to say to\nMr. Moggs, she allowed herself at last to be led forth. Till they\nhad passed the railway station on the road leading away from\nLondon, Ontario said not a word of his purpose. Polly, feeling that\nsilence was awkward, and finding that she was being hurried along\nat a tremendous pace, spoke of the weather and of the heat, and\nexpostulated. \"It is hot, very hot,\" said Ontario, taking off his hat\nand wiping his brow,--\"but there are moments in a man's life when he\ncan't go slow.\"\n\n\"Then there are moments in his life when he must go on by himself,\"\nsaid Polly. But her pluck was too good for her to desert him at such\na moment, and, although he hardly moderated his pace till he had\npassed the railway station, she kept by his side. As things had gone\nso far it might be quite as well now that she should hear what he had\nto say. A dim, hazy idea had crossed the mind of Moggs that it would\nbe as well that he should get out into the country before he began\nhis task, and that the line of the railway which passed beneath the\nroad about a quarter of a mile beyond Mr. Neefit's cottage, might be\nconsidered as the boundary which divided the town from pastoral joys.\nHe waited, therefore, till the bridge was behind them, till they\nhad passed the station, which was close to the bridge;--and then he\nbegan. \"Polly,\" said he, \"you know what brings me here.\"\n\nPolly did know very well, but she was not bound to confess such\nknowledge. \"You've brought me here, Mr. Moggs, and that's all I\nknow,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes;--I've brought you here. Polly, what took place last night made\nme very unhappy,--very unhappy indeed.\"\n\n\"I can't help that, Mr. Moggs.\"\n\n\"Not that I mean to blame you.\"\n\n\"Blame me! I should think not. Blame me, indeed! Why are you to blame\nanybody because father chooses to ask whom he pleases to dinner? A\npretty thing indeed, if father isn't to have whom he likes in his own\nhouse.\"\n\n\"Polly, you know what I mean.\"\n\n\"I know you made a great goose of yourself last night, and I didn't\nfeel a bit obliged to you.\"\n\n\"No, I didn't. I wasn't a goose at all. I don't say but what I'm as\nbig a fool as most men. I don't mean to stick up for myself. I know\nwell enough that I am foolish often. But I wasn't foolish last night.\nWhat was he there for?\"\n\n\"What business have you to ask, Mr. Moggs?\"\n\n\"All the business in life. Love;--real love. That's why I have\nbusiness. That young man, who is, I suppose, what you call a swell.\"\n\n\"Don't put words into my mouth, Mr. Moggs. I don't call him anything\nof the kind.\"\n\n\"He's a gentleman.\"\n\n\"Yes;--he is a gentleman,--I suppose.\"\n\n\"And I'm a tradesman,--a bootmaker.\"\n\n\"So is father a tradesman, and if you mean to tell me that I turn\nup my nose at people the same as father is, you may just go back to\nLondon and think what you like about me. I won't put up with it from\nyou or anybody. A tradesman to me is as good as anybody,--if he is as\ngood. There.\"\n\n\"Oh, Polly, you do look so beautiful!\"\n\n\"Bother!\"\n\n\"When you say that, and speak in that way, I think you as good as you\nare beautiful.\"\n\n\"Remember,--I don't say a word against what you call--gentlemen. I\ntake 'em just as they come. Mr. Newton is a very nice young man.\"\n\n\"Are you going to take him, Polly?\"\n\n\"How can I take him when he has never asked me? You are not my\nfather, Mr. Moggs, not yet my uncle. What right have you to question\nme? If I was going to take him, I shouldn't want your leave.\"\n\n\"Polly, you ought to be honest.\"\n\n\"I am honest.\"\n\n\"Will you hear me, Polly?\"\n\n\"No, I won't.\"\n\n\"You won't! Is that answer to go for always?\"\n\n\"Yes, it is. You come and tease and say uncivil things, and I don't\nchoose to be bullied. What right have you to talk to me about Mr.\nNewton? Did I ever give you any right? Honest indeed! What right have\nyou to talk to me about being honest?\"\n\n\"It's all true, dear.\"\n\n\"Very well, then. Hold your tongue, and don't say such things. Honest\nindeed! If I were to take the young man to-morrow, that would not\nmake me dishonest.\"\n\n\"It's all true, dear, and I beg your pardon. If I have offended you,\nI will beg your pardon.\"\n\n\"Never mind about that;--only don't say foolish things.\"\n\n\"Is it foolish, Polly, to say that I love you? And if I love you, can\nI like to see a young fellow like Mr. Newton hanging about after you?\nHe doesn't love you. He can't love you,--as I do. Your father brings\nhim here because he is a gentleman.\"\n\n\"I don't think anything of his being a gentleman.\"\n\n\"But think of me. Of course I was unhappy, wretched,--miserable. I\nknew why he was there. You can understand, Polly, that when a man\nreally loves he must be the miserablest or the happiest of human\nbeings.\"\n\n\"I don't understand anything about it.\"\n\n\"I wish you would let me teach you.\"\n\n\"I don't want to learn, and I doubt whether you'd make a good master.\nI really must go back now, Mr. Moggs. I came out because mother said\nI'd better. I don't know that it could do any good if we were to walk\non to Edgeware.\" And so saying, Polly turned back.\n\nHe walked beside her half the way home in silence, thinking that if\nhe could only choose the proper words and the proper tone he might\nyet prevail; but feeling that the proper words and the proper tone\nwere altogether out of his reach. On those favourite subjects, the\nballot, or the power of strikes, he could always find the proper\nwords and the proper tone when he rose upon his legs at the Cheshire\nCheese;--and yet, much as he loved the ballot, he loved Polly Neefit\ninfinitely more dearly. When at the Cheshire Cheese he was a man;\nbut now, walking with the girl of his heart, he felt himself to be a\nbootmaker, and the smell of the leather depressed him. It was evident\nthat she would walk the whole way home in silence, if he would permit\nit. The railway station was already again in sight, when he stopped\nher on the pathway, and made one more attempt. \"You believe me, when\nI say that I love you?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Mr. Moggs.\"\n\n\"Oh, Polly, you don't know!\"\n\n\"But it doesn't signify,--not the least. I ain't bound to take a man\nbecause he loves me.\"\n\n\"You won't take Mr. Newton;--will you?\"\n\n\"I don't know. I won't say anything about it. Mr. Newton is nothing\nto you.\" Then there was a pause. \"If you think, Mr. Moggs, that you\ncan recommend yourself to a young woman by such tantrums as there\nwere going on last night, you are very much mistaken. That's not the\nway to win me.\"\n\n\"I wish I knew which was the way.\"\n\n\"Mr. Newton never said a word.\"\n\n\"Your father told him to take you out a-walking before my very eyes!\nWas I to bear that? Think of it, Polly. You mayn't care for me, and\nI don't suppose you do; but you may understand what my feelings were.\nWhat would you have thought of me if I'd stayed there, smoking, and\nborne it quiet,--and you going about with that young man? I'll tell\nyou what it is, Polly, I couldn't bear it, and I won't. There;--and\nnow you know what I mean.\" At this point in his speech he took off\nhis hat and waved it in the air. \"I won't bear it. There are things\na man can't bear,--can't bear,--can't bear. Oh, Polly! if you could\nonly be brought to understand what it is that I feel!\"\n\nAfter all, he didn't do it so very badly. There was just a tear in\nthe corner of Polly's eye, though Polly was very careful that he\nshouldn't see it. And Polly did know well enough that he was in\nearnest,--that he was, in fact, true. But then he was gawky and\nungainly. It was not that he was a shoemaker. Could he have had his\nown wits, and danced like the gasfitter, he might have won her still,\nagainst Ralph Newton, with all his blood and white hands. But poor\nOntario was, as regarded externals, so ill a subject for a great\npassion!\n\n\"And where have you been, Polly?\" said her father, as soon as she\nentered the house.\n\n\"I have been walking with Ontario Moggs,\" said Polly boldly.\n\n\"What have you been saying to him? I won't have you walk with Ontario\nMoggs. I and your mother 'll have to fall out if this kind of thing\ngoes on.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly, father.\"\n\n\"What do you mean by that, miss?\"\n\n\"It is silly. Why shouldn't I walk with him? Haven't I known him all\nmy life, and walked with him scores of times? Isn't it silly, father?\nDon't I know that if I told you I loved Ontario Moggs, you'd let me\nmarry him to-morrow?\"\n\n\"He'd have to take you in what you stand up in.\"\n\n\"He wouldn't desire anything better. I'll say that for him. He's true\nand honest. I'd love him if I could,--only, somehow I don't.\"\n\n\"You've told him you didn't,--once and for all?\"\n\n\"I don't know about that, father. He'll come again, you may be\nsure. He's one of that sort that isn't easily said nay to. If you\nmean,--have I said yes?--I haven't. I'll never say yes to any man\nunless I love him. When I do say it I shall mean it,--whether it's\nOnty Moggs or anybody else. I'm not going to be given away, you know,\nlike a birthday present, out of a shop. There's nobody can give me\naway, father,--only myself.\" To all which utterances of a rebellious\nspirit the breeches-maker made no answer. He knew that Polly would,\nat least, be true to him; and, as she was as yet free, the field was\nstill open to his candidate. He believed thoroughly that had not his\nwife interfered, and asked the bootmaker to join that unfortunate\ndinner party, his daughter and Ralph Newton would now have been\nengaged together. And probably it might have been so. When first it\nhad been whispered to Polly that that handsome and very agreeable\nyoung gentleman, Mr. Ralph Newton, might become a suitor for her\nhand, she had chucked up her head and declared to her mother that she\ndidn't intend to take a husband of her father's choosing; but as she\ncame to know Ralph a little, she did find that he was good-looking\nand agreeable,--and her heart did flutter at the idea of becoming\nthe wife of a real, undoubted gentleman. She meant to have her grand\npassion, and she must be quite sure that Mr. Newton loved her. But\nshe didn't see any reason why Mr. Newton shouldn't love her, and,\nupon the whole, she was inclined to obey her father rather than to\ndisobey him. And it might still be that he should win her;--for he\nhad done nothing to disgrace himself in her sight. But there did lurk\nwithin her bosom some dim idea that he should have bestirred himself\nmore thoroughly on that Sunday evening, and not have allowed himself\nto be driven out of the field by Ontario Moggs. She wronged him\nthere, as indeed he had had no alternative, unless he had followed\nher up to her bedroom.\n\nMr. Neefit, when he found that no harm had as yet been done, resolved\nthat he would return to the charge. It has been before observed that\nhe lacked something in delicacy, but what he did so lack he made up\nin persistency. He had been unable to impute any blame to Ralph as to\nthat evening. He felt that he rather owed an apology to his favourite\ncandidate. He would make the apology, and inform the favourite\ncandidate, at the same time, that the course was still open to him.\nWith these views he left Conduit Street early on the Wednesday\nmorning, and called on Ralph at his rooms. \"Mr. Newton,\" he said,\nhastening at once upon the grand subject, \"I hope you didn't think as\nI was to blame in having Moggs at our little dinner on Sunday.\" Ralph\ndeclared that he had never thought of imputing blame to any one. \"But\nit was,--as awk'ard as awk'ard could be. It was my wife's doing. Of\ncourse you can see how it all is. That chap has been hankering after\nPolly ever since she was in her teens. But, Lord love you, Captain,\nhe ain't a chance with her. He was there again o' Monday, but the\ngirl wouldn't have a word to say to him.\" Ralph sat silent, and very\ngrave. He was taken now somewhat by surprise, having felt, up to\nthis moment, that he would at least have the advantage of a further\ninterview with Sir Thomas, before he need say another word to Mr.\nNeefit. \"What I want you to do, Captain, is just to pop it, straight\noff, to my girl. I know she'd take you, because of her way of\nlooking. Not, mind, that she ever said so. Oh, no. But the way to\nfind out is just to ask the question.\"\n\n\"You see, Mr. Neefit, it wasn't very easy to ask it last Sunday,\"\nsaid Ralph, attempting to laugh.\n\n\"Moggs has been at her again,\" said Neefit. This argument was\ngood. Had Ralph been as anxious as Moggs, he would have made his\nopportunity.\n\n\"And, to tell you the truth, Mr. Neefit--\"\n\n\"Well, sir?\"\n\n\"There is nothing so disagreeable as interfering in families. I\nadmire your daughter amazingly.\"\n\n\"She's a trump, Mr. Newton.\"\n\n\"She is indeed;--and I thoroughly appreciate the great generosity of\nyour offer.\"\n\n\"I'll be as good as my word, Mr. Newton. The money shall be all\nthere,--down on the nail.\"\n\n\"But, you see, your wife is against me.\"\n\n\"Blow my wife. You don't think Polly 'd do what her mother tells her?\nWho's got the money-bag? That's the question. You go down and pop it\nstraight. You ain't afraid of an old woman, I suppose;--nor yet of a\nyoung un. Don't mind waiting for more dinners, or anything of that\nkind. They likes a man to be hot about it;--that's what they likes.\nYou're sure to find her any time before dinner;--that's at one, you\nknow. May be she mayn't be figged out fine, but you won't mind that.\nI'll go bail you'll find the flesh and blood all right. Just you make\nyour way in, and say what you've got to say. I'll make it straight\nwith the old woman afterwards.\"\n\nRalph Newton had hitherto rather prided himself on his happy\nmanagement of young ladies. He was not ordinarily much afflicted by\nshyness, and conceived himself able to declare a passion, perhaps\nwhether felt or feigned, as well as another. And now he was being\ntaught how to go a-wooing by his breeches-maker! He did not\naltogether like it, and, as at this moment his mind was rather set\nagainst the Hendon matrimonial speculation, he was disposed to resent\nit. \"I think you're making a little mistake, Mr. Neefit,\" he said.\n\n\"What mistake? I don't know as I'm making any mistake. You'll be\nmaking a mistake, and so you'll find when the plum's gone.\"\n\n\"It's just this, you know. When you suggested this thing to me--\"\n\n\"Well;--yes; I did suggest it, and I ain't ashamed of it.\"\n\n\"I was awfully grateful. I had met your daughter once or twice, and I\ntold you I admired her ever so much.\"\n\n\"That's true;--but you didn't admire her a bit more than what she's\nentitled to.\"\n\n\"I'm sure of that. But then I thought I ought,--just to,--know her a\nlittle better, you see. And then how could I presume to think she'd\ntake me till she knew me a little better?\"\n\n\"Presume to think! Is that all you know about young women? Pop the\nquestion right out, and give her a buss. That's the way.\"\n\nNewton paused a moment before he spoke, and looked very grave. \"I\nthink you're driving me a little too fast, Mr. Neefit,\" he said at\nlast.\n\n\"The deuce I am! Driving you too fast. What does that mean?\"\n\n\"There must be a little management and deliberation in these things.\nIf I were to do as you propose, I should not recommend myself to your\ndaughter; and I should myself feel that, at the most important crisis\nof my life, I was allowing myself to be hurried beyond my judgment.\"\nThese words were spoken with a slow solemnity of demeanour, and a\ntone of voice so serious that for a moment they perfectly awed the\nbreeches-maker. Ralph was almost successful in reducing his proposed\nfather-in-law to a state of absolute subjection. Mr. Neefit was all\nbut induced to forget that he stood there with twenty thousand pounds\nin his pocket. There came a drop or two of perspiration on his brow,\nand his large saucer eyes almost quailed before those of his debtor.\nBut at last he rallied himself,--though not entirely. He could not\nquite assume that self-assertion which he knew that his position\nwould have warranted; but he did keep his flag up after a fashion.\n\"I dare say you know your own business best, Mr. Newton;--only them's\nnot my ideas; that's all. I come to you fair and honest, and I\nrepeats the same. Good morning, Mr. Newton.\" So he went, and nothing\nhad been settled.\n\nTo say that Ralph had even yet made up his mind would be to give him\npraise which was not his due. He was still doubting, though in his\ndoubts the idea of marrying Polly Neefit became more indistinct, and\nless alluring than ever. By this time he almost hated Mr. Neefit,\nand most unjustly regarded that man as a persecutor, who was taking\nadvantage of his pecuniary ascendancy to trample on him. \"He\nthinks I must take his daughter because I owe him two or three\nhundred pounds.\" Such were Ralph Newton's thoughts about the\nbreeches-maker,--which thoughts were very unjust. Neefit was\ncertainly vulgar, illiterate, and indelicate; but he was a man who\ncould do a generous action, and having offered his daughter to this\nyoung aristocrat would have scorned to trouble him afterwards about\nhis \"little bill.\" Ralph sat trying to think for about an hour, and\nthen walked to Southampton Buildings. He had not much hope as he\nwent. Indeed hope hardly entered into his feelings. Sir Thomas\nwould of course say unpleasant words to him, and of course he\nwould be unable to answer them. There was no ground for hoping\nanything,--unless indeed he could make himself happy in a snug little\nbox in a hunting country, with Polly Neefit for his wife, living on\nthe interest of the breeches-maker's money. He was quite alive to the\nfact that in this position he would in truth be the most miserable\ndog in existence,--that it would be infinitely better for him to turn\nhis prospects into cash, and buy sheep in Australia, or cattle in\nSouth America, or to grow corn in Canada. Any life would be better\nthan one supported in comfortable idleness on Mr. Neefit's savings.\nNevertheless he felt that that would most probably be his doom. The\nsheep or the cattle or the corn required an amount of energy which he\nno longer possessed. There were the four horses at the Moonbeam;--and\nhe could ride them to hounds as well as any man. So much he could do,\nand would seem in doing it to be full of life. But as for selling\nthe four horses, and changing altogether the mode of his life,--that\nwas more than he had vitality left to perform. Such was the measure\nwhich he took of himself, and in taking it he despised himself\nthoroughly,--knowing well how poor a creature he was.\n\nSir Thomas told him readily what he had done, giving him to read a\ncopy of his letter to Mr. Newton and Mr. Newton's reply. \"I can do\nnothing more,\" said Sir Thomas. \"I hope you have given up the sad\nnotion of marrying that young woman.\" Ralph sat still and listened.\n\"No good, I think, can come of that,\" continued Sir Thomas. \"If you\nare in truth compelled to part with your reversion to the Newton\nestate,--which is in itself a property of great value,--I do not\ndoubt but your uncle will purchase it at its worth. It is a thousand\npities that prospects so noble should have been dissipated by early\nimprudence.\"\n\n\"That's quite true, Sir Thomas,\" said Ralph, in a loud ringing tone,\nwhich seemed to imply that let things be as bad as they might he\ndid not mean to make a poor mouth of them. It was his mask for the\noccasion, and it sufficed to hide his misery from Sir Thomas.\n\n\"If you think of selling what you have to sell,\" continued Sir\nThomas, \"you had better take Mr. Newton's letter and put it into the\nhands of your own attorney. It will be ten times better than going\nto the money-lending companies for advances. If I had the means of\nhelping you myself, I would do it.\"\n\n\"Oh, Sir Thomas!\"\n\n\"But I have not. I should be robbing my own girls, which I am sure\nyou would not wish.\"\n\n\"That is quite out of the question, Sir Thomas.\"\n\n\"If you do resolve on selling the estate, you had better come to me\nas the thing goes on. I can't do much, but I may perhaps be able to\nsee that nothing improper is proposed for you to do. Goodbye, Ralph.\nAnything will be better than marrying that what-d'ye-callem's\ndaughter.\"\n\nRalph, as he walked westwards towards the club, was by no means sure\nthat Sir Thomas had been right in this. By marrying Polly he would,\nafter all, keep the property.\n\nJust by the lions in Trafalgar Square he met Ontario Moggs. Ontario\nMoggs scowled at him, and cut him dead.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nTHE REV. GREGORY NEWTON.\n\n\nIt was quite at the end of July, in the very hottest days of a very\nhot summer, that Squire Newton left Newton Priory for London, intent\nupon law business, and filled with ambition to purchase the right\nof leaving his own estate to any heir whom he might himself select.\nHe left his son alone at the Priory; but his son and the parson\nwere sure to be together on such an occasion. Ralph,--the country\nRalph,--dined at the Rectory on the day that his father started; and\non every succeeding day, Gregory, the parson, dined up at the large\nhouse. It was a thing altogether understood at the Priory that the\npresent parson Gregory was altogether exempted from the anathema\nwhich had been pronounced against the heir and against the memory\nof the heir's father. Gregory simply filled the place which might\nhave been his had there been no crushing entail, and was, moreover,\nso sweet and gentle-hearted a fellow that it was impossible not\nto love him. He was a tall, slender man, somewhat narrow-chested,\nbright-eyed, with a kind-looking sweet mouth, a small well-cut nose,\ndark but not black hair, and a dimple on his chin. He always went\nwith his hands in his pockets, walking quick, but shuffling sometimes\nin step as though with hesitation, stooping somewhat, absent\noccasionally, going about with his chin stuck out before him, as\nthough he were seeking something,--he knew not what. A more generous\nfellow, who delighted more in giving, hesitated more in asking, more\naverse to begging though a friend of beggars, less self-arrogant, or\nself-seeking, or more devoted to his profession, never lived. He was\na man with prejudices,--kindly, gentlemanlike, amiable prejudices. He\nthought that a clergyman should be a graduate from one of the three\nuniversities,--including Trinity, Dublin; and he thought, also,\nthat a clergyman should be a gentleman. He thought that Dissenters\nwere,--a great mistake. He thought that Convocation should be\npotential. He thought that the Church had certain powers and\nprivileges which Parliament could not take away except by spoliation.\nHe thought that a parson should always be well-dressed,--according to\nhis order. He thought that the bishop of his diocese was the purest,\nbest, and noblest peer in England. He thought that Newton Churchyard\nwas, of all spots on earth, the most lovely. He thought very little\nof himself. And he thought that of all the delights given by God for\nthe delectation of his creatures, the love of Clarissa Underwood\nwould be the most delightful. In all these thinkings he was astray,\ncarried away by prejudices which he was not strong enough to\nwithstand. But the joint effect of so many faults in judgment was not\ndisagreeable; and, as one result of that effect, Gregory Newton was\nloved and respected and believed in by all men and women, poor and\nrich, who lived within knowledge of his name. His uncle Gregory, who\nwas wont to be severe in his judgment on men, would declare that the\nRev. Gregory,--as he was called,--was perfect. But then the Squire\nwas a man who was himself very much subject to prejudices.\n\nThere was now, and ever had been, great freedom of discussion between\nRalph Newton of the Priory and his cousin Gregory,--if under the\ncircumstances the two young men may be called cousins,--respecting\nthe affairs of the property. There was naturally much to check or to\nprevent such freedom. Their own interests in regard to the property\nwere, as far as they went, adverse. The young parson might possibly\ninherit the whole of the estate, whereas he was aware that the\npresent Squire would move heaven and earth to leave it, or a portion\nof it, to his own son. Gregory had always taken his brother's part\nbefore the Squire; and the Squire, much as he liked the parson, was\nnever slow in abusing the parson's brother. It would have been no\nmore than natural had the question of the property been, by tacit\nagreement, always kept out of sight between the two young men. But\nthey had grown up from boyhood together as firm friends, and there\nwas no reticence between them on this all-important subject. The\nSquire's son had never known his mother; and could therefore speak\nof his own position as would hardly have been possible to him had\nany memory of her form or person remained with him. And then, though\ntheir interests were opposite, nothing that either could say would\nmuch affect those interests.\n\nThe two men were sitting on the lawn at the Priory after dinner,\nsmoking cigars, and Ralph,--this other Ralph,--had just told the\nparson of his intention of joining his father in London. \"I don't see\nthat I can do any good,\" said Ralph, \"but he wishes it, and of course\nI shall go.\"\n\n\"You won't see my brother, I suppose?\"\n\n\"I should think not. You know what my father's feelings are, and\nI certainly shall not go out of my way to offend them. I have no\nanimosity against Ralph; but I could do no good by opposing my\nfather.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the parson, \"not but what I wish it were otherwise. It is\na trouble to me that I cannot have Ralph here;--though perhaps he\nwould not care to come.\"\n\n\"I feel it hard too, that he should not be allowed to see a place\nwhich, in a measure, belongs to him. I wish with all my heart that\nmy father did not think so much about the estate. Much as I love the\nold place, I can hardly think about it without bitterness. Had my\nfather and your brother been on good terms together, there would\nhave been none of that. Nothing that he could do,--no success in his\nefforts,--can make me be as I should have been had I been born his\nheir. It is a misfortune, and of course one feels it; but I think I\nshould feel it less were he not so fixed in his purpose to undo what\ncan never be undone.\"\n\n\"He will never succeed,\" said Gregory.\n\n\"Probably not;--though, for that matter, I suppose Ralph will be\ndriven to raise money on his inheritance.\"\n\n\"He will never sell the property.\"\n\n\"It seems that he does spend money faster than he can get it.\"\n\n\"He may have done so.\"\n\n\"Is he not always in debt to you yourself? Is he not now thinking\nof marrying some tradesman's daughter to relieve him of his\nembarrassments? We have to own, I suppose, that Master Ralph has made\na mess of his money matters?\" The parson, who couldn't deny the fact,\nhardly knew what to say on his brother's behalf. \"I protest to you,\nGreg, that if my father were to tell me that he had changed his mind,\nand paid your brother's debts out of sheer kindness and uncleship,\nand the rest of it, I should be well pleased. But he won't do that,\nand it does seem to me probable that the estate will get into the\nhands of Jews, financiers, and professional money-dealers, unless my\nfather can save it. You wouldn't be glad to see some shopkeeper's\ndaughter calling herself Mrs. Newton of Newton.\"\n\n\"A shopkeeper's daughter need not necessarily be a--a--a bad sort of\nwoman,\" said Gregory.\n\n\"The chances are that a shopkeeper's daughter will not be an educated\nlady. Come, Greg;--you cannot say that it is the kind of way out of\nthe mess you would approve.\"\n\n\"I am so sorry that there should be any mess at all!\"\n\n\"Just so. It is a pity that there should be any mess;--is not it?\nCome, old fellow, drink your coffee, and let us take a turn across\nthe park. I want to see what Larkin is doing about those sheep. I\noften feel that my coming into the world was a mess altogether;\nthough, now that I am here, I must make the best of it. If I hadn't\ncome, my father would have married, and had a score of children, and\nMaster Ralph would have been none the better for it.\"\n\n\"You'll go and see the Underwoods,\" said the parson, as they were\nwalking across the park.\n\n\n[Illustration: \"You'll go and see the Underwoods,\" said the parson,\nas they were walking across the park.]\n\n\n\"If you wish it, I will.\"\n\n\"I do wish it. They know all the history as a matter of course. It\ncannot be otherwise. And they have so often heard me talk of you. The\ngirls are simply perfect. I shall write to Miss Underwood, and tell\nher that you will call. I hope, too, that you will see Sir Thomas. It\nwould be so much better that he should know you.\"\n\nThat same night Gregory Newton wrote the two following letters before\nhe went to bed;--the first written was to Miss Underwood, and the\nsecond to his brother; but we will place the latter first;--\n\n\n   Newton, 4th August, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR RALPH,--\n\n   No doubt you know by this time that my uncle, Gregory, is\n   in London, though you will probably not have seen him. I\n   understand that he has come up with the express purpose\n   of making some settlement in regard to the property, on\n   account of your embarrassments. I need not tell you how\n   sorry I am that the state of your affairs should make this\n   necessary. Ralph goes up also to-morrow;--and though he\n   does not purpose to hunt you up, I hope that you may meet.\n   You know what I think of him, and how much I wish that you\n   two could be friends. He is as generous as the sun, and\n   as just as he is generous. Every Newton ought to make him\n   welcome as one of the family.\n\n   As to money, I do not know what may be the state of\n   your affairs. I only hear from him what he hears from\n   his father. Sooner than that you should endanger your\n   inheritance here I will make any sacrifice,--if there be\n   anything that I can do. You are welcome to sell my share\n   of the Holborn property, and you can pay me after my\n   uncle's death. I can get on very well with my living,\n   as it is not probable that I shall marry. At any rate,\n   understand that I should infinitely prefer to lose every\n   shilling of the London property to hearing that you had\n   imperilled your position here at Newton. I do not suppose\n   that what I have can go far;--but as far as it will go it\n   is at your service. You can show this letter to Sir Thomas\n   if you think fit.\n\n   I could say ever so much more, only that you will know\n   it all without my saying it. And I cannot bear that you\n   should think that I would preach sermons to you. Never\n   mind what I said before about the money that I wanted\n   then. I can do without it now. My uncle will pay for the\n   entire repair of the chancel out of his own pocket. Ever\n   so much must be left undone till more money comes in.\n   Money does come in from this quarter or from that, by\n   God's help. As for the church rates, of course I regret\n   them. But we have to take things in a lump, and it is\n   certainly the fact that we spend ten times as much on the\n   churches as was spent fifty years ago.\n\n   Your most affectionate brother,\n\n   GREGORY NEWTON.\n\n\nThe other letter was much shorter, and was addressed to Patience\nUnderwood;--\n\n\n   Newton Peele Parsonage, 4th August, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR MISS UNDERWOOD,--\n\n   My cousin, Mr. Ralph Newton, of whom you have heard me\n   speak so often, is going up to London, and I have asked\n   him to call at Popham Villa, because I am desirous that so\n   very dear a friend of mine should know other friends whom\n   I love so dearly. I am sure you will receive him kindly\n   for my sake, and that you will like him for his own. There\n   are reasons why I wish that your father should know him.\n\n   Give my most affectionate love to your sister. I can send\n   her no other message, and I do not think she will be angry\n   with me for sending that. It cannot hurt her; and she and\n   you at least know how honest and how true it is. Distance\n   and time make no difference. It is as though I were on the\n   lawn with her now.\n\n   Most sincerely yours,\n\n   GREGORY NEWTON.\n\n\nWhen he had written this in the little book-room of his parsonage he\nopened the window, and, crossing the garden, seated himself on a low\nbrick wall, which divided his small domain from the churchyard. The\nnight was bright with stars, but there was no moon in the heavens,\nand the gloom of the old ivy-coloured church tower was complete. But\nall the outlines of the place were so well known to him that he could\ntrace them all in the dim light. After a while he got down among the\ngraves, and with slow steps walked round and round the precincts of\nhis church. Here, at least, in this spot, close to the house of God\nwhich was his own church, within this hallowed enclosure, which was\nhis own freehold in a peculiar manner, he could, after a fashion, be\nhappy, in spite of the misfortunes of himself and his family. His\nlines had been laid for him in very pleasant places. According to his\nideas there was no position among the children of men more blessed,\nmore diversified, more useful, more noble, than that which had been\nawarded to him,--if only, by God's help, he could perform with\nadequate zeal and ability the high duties which had been entrusted\nto him. Things outside were dark,--at least, so said the squires and\nparsons around him, with whom he was wont to associate. His uncle,\nGregory, was sure that all things were going to the dogs, since a\nso-called Tory leader had become an advocate for household suffrage,\nand real Tory gentlemen had condescended to follow him. But to our\nparson it had always seemed that there was still a fresh running\nstream of water for him who would care to drink from a fresh stream.\nHe heard much of unbelief, and of the professors of unbelief, both\nwithin and without the great Church;--but in that little church with\nwhich he was personally concerned there were more worshippers now\nthan there had ever been before. And he heard, too, how certain\nwell-esteemed preachers and prophets of the day talked loudly of\nthe sins of the people, and foretold destruction such as was the\ndestruction of Gomorrah;--but to him it seemed that the people of his\nvillage were more honest, less given to drink, and certainly better\neducated than their fathers. In all which thoughts he found matter\nfor hope and encouragement in his daily life. And he set himself to\nwork diligently, placing all this as a balance against his private\nsorrows, so that he might teach himself to take that world, of\nwhich he himself was the centre, as one whole,--and so to walk on\nrejoicing.\n\nThe one great sorrow of his life, the thorn in the flesh which was\nalways festering, the wound which would not be cured, the grief for\nwhich there was no remedy, was his love for Clarissa Underwood. He\nhad asked her thrice to be his wife,--with very little interval,\nindeed, between the separate prayers,--and had been so answered that\nhe entertained no hope. Had there been any faintest expectation in\nhis mind that Clarissa would at last become his wife he would have\nbeen deterred by a sense of duty from making to his brother that\ngenerous offer of all the property he owned. But he had no such hope.\nClarissa had given thrice that answer, which of all answers is the\nmost grievous to the true-hearted lover. \"She felt for him unbounded\nesteem, and would always regard him as a friend.\" A short decided\nnegative, or a doubtful no, or even an indignant repulse, may\nbe changed,--may give way to second convictions, or to better\nacquaintance, or to altered circumstances, or even simply to\nperseverance. But an assurance of esteem and friendship means, and\nonly can mean, that the lady regards her lover as she might do some\nold uncle or patriarchal family connection, whom, after a fashion,\nshe loves, but who can never be to her the one creature to be\nworshipped above all others.\n\nSuch were Gregory Newton's ideas as to his own chance of success,\nand, so believing, he had resolved that he would never press his\nsuit again. He endeavoured to conquer his love;--but that he found\nto be impossible. He thought that it was so impossible that he had\ndetermined to give up the endeavour. Though he would have advised\nothers that by God's mercy all sorrows in this world could be cured,\nhe told himself,--without arraigning God's mercy,--that for him this\nsorrow could not be cured. He did not scruple, therefore, to assure\nhis brother that he would not marry,--nor did he hesitate, in writing\nto Patience Underwood, to assure her that his love for her sister was\nunchangeable. In saying so he urged no suit;--but it was impossible\nthat he should write to the house without some message, and none\nother from him to her could be a true message. It could not hurt\nher. It would not even give her the trouble to think whether she\nhad decided well. He quite understood the nature of the love he\nwanted,--a love that would have felt it to be all happiness to lean\nupon his bosom. Without this love he would not have wished to take\nher;--and with such love as that he knew he could not fill her heart.\nTherefore it was that he would satisfy himself with walking round the\nchurchyard of Newton Peele, and telling himself that the pleasure of\nthis world was best to be found in the pursuit of the joys of the\nnext.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nCLARISSA WAITS.\n\n\nWhen Patience and Clarissa had got to their own room on the night\non which they had walked back from Mrs. Brownlow's house to Popham\nVilla,--during all which long walk Clarissa's hand had lain gently\nupon Ralph Newton's arm,--the elder sister looked painfully and\nanxiously into the younger's face, in order that, if it were\npossible, she might learn without direct enquiry what had been said\nduring that hour of close communion. Had Ralph meant to speak there\ncould have been no time more appropriate. And Patience hardly knew\nwhat she herself wished,--except that she wished that her sister\nmight have everything that was good and joyous and prosperous. There\nwas never a look of pain came across Clary's face, but Patience\nsuffered some touch of inner agony. This feeling was so strong that\nshe sympathised even with Clary's follies, and with Clary's faults.\nShe almost knew that it would not be well that Ralph Newton should be\nencouraged as a lover,--brilliant as were his future prospects, and\ndear, as he was personally to them all. He was a spendthrift, and\nit might be that his fine prospects would all be wasted before they\nwere matured. And then their father would so probably disapprove!\nAnd then, again, it was so wrong that Clary's peace should have been\ndisturbed and yet no word said to their father. There was much that\nwas wrong;--but still so absolute was her clinging love for Clary\nthat she longed above all things that Clary should be made happy.\nWhen Ralph's brother had declared himself as a suitor,--which he\nhad done boldly to Sir Thomas, after but a short intimacy with the\nfamily,--Patience had given him all her sympathy. Sir Thomas, having\nlooked at his circumstances, had made him welcome to the house, and\nto his daughter's hand,--if he could win her heart. The stage had\nbeen open to him, and Patience had been his most eager friend. But\nall that had passed away,--and Clary had been obstinate. \"Patty,\"\nshe had said, with some little arrogance, \"he has made a mistake.\nHe should have fallen in love with you.\" \"Clergymen are as fond of\npretty girls as other men,\" Patty had said, with a smile. \"And isn't\nmy Patty as pretty and as delicate as a primrose?\" Clary had said,\nembracing her sister. Pretty Patience Underwood was not;--but for\ndelicacy,--that with which Patience Underwood was gifted transcended\npoor Clarissa's powers of comparison. So it was between them, and now\nthere was this acknowledged passion for the spendthrift!\n\nPatience could see that her sister was not unhappy when she came in\nfrom her walk,--was not moody,--was not heart-broken. And yet it had\nseemed to her, before the walk began, while they were sauntering\nabout Mrs. Brownlow's garden, that Ralph had devoted himself entirely\nto the new cousin, and that Clarissa had been miserable. Surely if he\nhad spoken during the walk,--if he had renewed his protestations of\nlove, if he were now regarded by Clary as her accepted lover, Clary\nwould not keep all this as a secret! It could not be that Clary\nshould have surrendered herself to a lover, and that their father\nwas to be allowed to remain in ignorance that it was so! And yet\nhow could it be otherwise if Clary was happy now,--Clary who had\nacknowledged that she loved this man, and had now been leaning on\nhis arm for an hour beneath the moonlight? But Patience said not a\nword. She could not bring herself to speak when speech might pain her\nsister.\n\nWhen they had been some half hour in bed, there stole a whisper\nacross the darkness of the chamber from one couch to the other;\n\"Patty, are you asleep?\" Patience declared that she was wide awake.\n\"Then I'll come to you,\"--and Clary's naked feet pattered across\nthe room. \"I've just something to say, and I'll say it better here.\"\nPatience made glad way for the intruder, and knew that now she would\nhear it all. \"Patty, it is better to wait.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, dear?\"\n\n\"I mean this. I think he does like me; I'm almost sure he does.\"\n\n\"He said nothing to-night?\"\n\n\"He said a great deal,--of course; but nothing about that;--nothing\nabout that exactly.\"\n\n\"Oh, Clary, I'm afraid of him.\"\n\n\"What is the good of fear? The evil is, dear, I think he likes me,\nbut it may so well be that he cannot speak out. He is in debt, and\nall that;--and he must wait.\"\n\n\"But that is so terrible. What will you do?\"\n\n\"I will wait too. I have thought about it, and have determined.\nWhat's the good of loving a man if one won't go through something for\nhim? I do love him,--with all my heart. I pray God I may never have a\nhusband, if I cannot be his wife.\" Patience shuddered in her sister's\nembrace, as these bold words were spoken with energy. \"I tell you,\nPatty, just as I tell myself, because you love me so dearly.\"\n\n\"I do love you;--oh, I do love you.\"\n\n\"I do not think it can be unmaidenly to tell the truth to you and\nto myself. How can I help telling it to myself? There it is. I feel\nthat I could kiss the very ground on which he stands. He is my\nhero, my Paladin, my heart, my soul. I have given myself to him for\neverything. How can I help myself?\"\n\n\"But, Clary,--you should repress this, not encourage it.\"\n\n\"It won't be repressed,--not in my own heart. But I will never,\nnever, never let him know that it has been so,--till he is all my\nown. There may be a day when,--oh,--I shall tell him everything;\nhow wretched I was when he did not speak to me;--how broken-hearted\nwhen I heard his voice with Mary; how fluttered, and half-happy,\nand half-wretched when I found that I was to have that long walk\nwith him;--and then how I determined to wait. I will tell him\nall,--perhaps,--some day. Good-night, dear, dear Patty. I could not\nsleep without letting you know everything.\" Then she sprang out from\nher sister's arms, and pattered back across the room to her own bed.\nIn two minutes Clarissa was asleep, but Patience lay long awake, and\nbefore she slept her pillow was damp with her tears.\n\nIn the course of the following week Ralph was again at the villa. Sir\nThomas, as a matter of course, was away, but the three girls were at\nhome; and, as it happened, Miss Spooner had also come over to take\nher tea with her friends. The hour that he spent there was passed\nhalf indoors and half out, and certainly Ralph's attentions were\nchiefly paid to Miss Bonner. Miss Bonner herself, however, was so\ndiscreet in her demeanour, that no one could have suggested that any\napproach had been made to flirtation. To tell the truth, Mary, who\nhad received no confidence from her cousin,--and who was a girl slow\nto excite or give a confidence,--had seen some sign, or heard some\nword which had created on her mind a suspicion of the truth. It was\nnot that she thought that Clary's heart was irrecoverably given to\nthe young man, but that there seemed to be just something with which\nit might be as well that she herself should not interfere. She was\nthere on sufferance,--dependent on her uncle's charity for her daily\nbread, let her uncle say what he might to the contrary. As yet she\nhardly knew her cousins, and was quite sure that she was not known by\nthem. She heard that Ralph Newton was a man of fashion, and the heir\nto a large fortune. She knew herself to be utterly destitute,--but\nshe knew herself to be possessed of great beauty. In her bosom,\ndoubtless, there was an ambition to win by her beauty, from some man\nwhom she could love, those good things of which she was so destitute.\nShe did not lack ambition, and had her high hopes, grounded on the\nknowledge of her own charms. Her beauty, and a certain sufficiency\nof intellect,--of the extent of which she was in a remarkable degree\nherself aware,--were the gifts with which she had been endowed. But\nshe knew when she might use them honestly and when she ought to\nrefrain from using them. Ralph had looked at her as men do look who\nwish to be allowed to love. All this to her was much more clearly\nintelligible than to Clarissa, who was two years her senior. Though\nshe had seen Ralph but thrice, she already felt that she might have\nhim on his knees before her, if she cared so to place him. But there\nwas that suspicion of something which had gone before, and a feeling\nthat honour and gratitude,--perhaps, also, self-interest,--called\nupon her to be cold in her manner to Ralph Newton. She had purposely\navoided his companionship in their walk home from Mrs. Brownlow's\nhouse; and now, as they wandered about the lawn and shrubberies of\nPopham Villa, she took care not to be with him out of earshot of\nthe others. In all of which there was ten times more of womanly\ncleverness,--or cunning, shall we say,--than had yet come to the\npossession of Clarissa Underwood.\n\nCunning she was;--but she did not deserve that the objectionable\nepithet should be applied to her. The circumstances of her life had\nmade her cunning. She had been the mistress of her father's house\nsince her fifteenth year, and for two years of her life had had a\nsuccession of admirers at her feet. Her father had eaten and drunk\nand laughed, and had joked with his child's lovers about his child.\nIt had been through no merit of his that she had held her own among\nthem all without soiling either her name or her inner self. Captains\nin West Indian regiments, and lieutenants from Queen's ships lying at\nSpanish Point, had been her admirers. Proposals to marry are as ready\non the tongues of such men, out in the tropics, as offers to hand\na shawl or carry a parasol. They are soft-hearted, bold to face\nthe world, and very confident in circumstances. Then, too, they\nare ignorant of any other way to progress with a flirtation which\nis all-engrossing. In warm latitudes it is so natural to make an\noffer after the fifth dance. It is the way of the people in those\nlatitudes, and seems to lead to no harm. Men and women do marry on\nsmall incomes; but they do not starve, and the world goes on wagging.\nMary Bonner, however, whose father's rank had, at least, been higher\nthan that of her adorers, and who knew that great gifts had been\ngiven to her, had held herself aloof from all this, and had early\nresolved to bide her time. She was still biding her time,--with\npatience sufficient to enable her to resist the glances of Ralph\nNewton.\n\nClarissa Underwood behaved very well on this evening. She gave a\nmerry glance at her sister, and devoted herself to Miss Spooner. Mary\nwas so wise and so prudent that there was no cause for any great\nagony. As far as Clary could see, Ralph had quite as much to say to\nPatience as to Mary. For herself she had resolved that she would\nwait. Her manner to him was very pretty,--almost the manner of\na sister to a brother. And then she stayed resolutely with Miss\nSpooner, while Ralph was certainly tempting Mary down by the\nriver-side. It did not last long. He was soon gone, and Miss Spooner\nhad soon followed him.\n\n\"He is very amusing,\" Mary said, as soon as they were alone.\n\n\"Very amusing,\" said Patience.\n\n\"And uncommonly good-looking. Isn't he considered a very handsome man\nhere?\"\n\n\"Yes;--I suppose he is,\" said Patience. \"I don't know that I ever\nthought much about that.\"\n\n\"Of course he is,\" said Clarissa. \"Nobody can doubt about it. There\nare some people as to whom it is as absurd not to admit that they are\nhandsome as it would be to say that a fine picture is not beautiful.\nRalph is one such person,--and of course I know another.\"\n\nMary would not seem to take the allusion, even by a smile. \"I always\nthought Gregory much nicer looking,\" said Patience.\n\n\"That must be because you are in love with him,\" said Clarissa.\n\n\"There is a speaking brightness, an eloquence, in his eyes; and a\nsoftness of feeling in the expression of his face, which is above all\nbeauty,\" continued Patience, with energy.\n\n\"Here's poetry,\" said Clarissa. \"Eloquence, and softness, and eyes,\nand feeling, and expressive and speaking brightness! You'd better say\nat once that he's a god.\"\n\n\"I wish I knew him,\" said Mary Bonner.\n\n\"You'll know him before long, I don't doubt. And when you do, you'll\nknow one of the best fellows in the world. I'll admit as much as\nthat; but I will not admit that he can be compared to his brother in\nregard to good looks.\" In all which poor Clarissa, who had nothing to\nconsole her but her resolve to wait with courage, bore herself well\nand gallantly.\n\nSoon after this there arrived at Popham Villa the note from Gregory\nNewton. As it happened, Sir Thomas was at home on that morning, and\nheard the tidings. \"If young Mr. Newton does come, get him to dine,\nand I will take care to be at home,\" said Sir Thomas. Patience\nsuggested that Ralph,--their own Ralph,--should be asked to meet him;\nbut to this Sir Thomas would not accede. \"It is not our business to\nmake up a family quarrel,\" he said. \"I have had old Mr. Newton with\nme once or twice lately, and I find that the quarrel still exists as\nstrong as ever. I asked him to dine here, but he refused. His son\nchooses to come. I shall be glad to see him.\"\n\nGregory's letter had not been shown to Sir Thomas, but it was, of\ncourse, shown to Clarissa. \"How could I help it?\" said she. From\nwhich it may be presumed that Patience had looked as though Gregory\nhad been hardly treated. \"One doesn't know how it is, or why it\ncomes, or what it is;--or why it doesn't come. I couldn't have taken\nGregory Newton for my husband.\"\n\n\"And yet he had all things to recommend him.\"\n\n\"I wish he had asked you, Patty!\"\n\n\"Don't say that, dear, because there is in it something that annoys\nme. I don't think of myself in such matters, but I do hope to see you\nthe happy wife of some happy man.\"\n\n\"I hope you will, with all my heart,\" said Clary, standing up,--\"of\none man, of one special, dearest, best, and brightest of all men. Oh\ndear! And yet I know it will never be, and I wonder at myself that I\nhave been bold enough to tell you.\" And Patience, also, wondered at\nher sister's boldness.\n\nRalph Newton,--Ralph from the Priory,--did come down to the villa,\nand did accept the invitation to dinner which was given to him. The\nevent was so important that Patience found it necessary to go up\nto London to tell her father. Mary went with her, desirous to see\nsomething of the mysteries of Southampton Buildings, while Clarissa\nremained at home,--waiting. After the usual skirmishes with Stemm,\nwho began by swearing that his master was not at home, they made\ntheir way into Sir Thomas's library. \"Dear, dear, dear; this is\na very awkward place to bring your cousin to,\" he said, frowning.\nMary would have retreated at once had it not been that Patience held\nher ground so boldly. \"Why shouldn't she come, papa? And I had to\nsee you. Mr. Newton is to dine with us to-morrow.\" To-morrow was\na Saturday, and Sir Thomas became seriously displeased. Why had a\nSaturday been chosen? Saturday was the most awkward day in the world\nfor the giving and receiving of dinners. It was in vain that Patience\nexplained to him that Saturday was the only day on which Mr. Newton\ncould come, that Sir Thomas had given his express authority for the\ndinner, and that no bar had been raised against Saturday. \"You ought\nto have known,\" said Sir Thomas. Nevertheless, he allowed them to\nleave the chamber with the understanding that he would preside at\nhis own table on the following day. \"Why is it that Saturday is so\ndistasteful to him?\" Mary asked as they walked across Lincoln's Inn\nFields together.\n\nPatience was silent for awhile, not knowing how to answer the\nquestion, or how to leave it unanswered. But at last she preferred to\nmake some reply. \"He does not like going to our church, I think.\"\n\n\"But you like it.\"\n\n\"Yes;--and I wish papa did. But he doesn't.\" Then there was a pause.\n\"Of course it must strike you as very odd, the way in which we live.\"\n\n\"I hope it is not I who drive my uncle away.\"\n\n\"Not in the least, Mary. Since mamma's death he has fallen into this\nhabit, and he has got so to love solitude, that he is never happy but\nwhen alone. We ought to be grateful to him because it shows that he\ntrusts us;--but it would be much nicer if he would come home.\"\n\n\"He is so different from my father.\"\n\n\"He was always with you.\"\n\n\"Well;--yes; that is, I could be always with him,--almost always.\nHe was so fond of society that he would never be alone. We had a\ngreat rambling house, always full of people. If he could see people\npleasant and laughing, that was all that he wanted. It is hard to say\nwhat is best.\"\n\n\"Papa is as good to us as ever he can be.\"\n\n\"So was my papa good to me,--in his way; but, oh dear, the people\nthat used to come there! Poor papa! He used to say that hospitality\nwas his chief duty. I sometimes used to think that the world\nwould be much pleasanter and better if there was no such thing as\nhospitality;--if people always eat and drank alone, and lived as\nuncle does, in his chambers. There would not be so much money wasted,\nat any rate.\"\n\n\"Papa never wastes any money,\" said Patience,--\"though there never\nwas a more generous man.\"\n\nRalph Newton,--Ralph of the Priory,--came to dinner, and Miss Spooner\nwas asked to meet him. It might have been supposed that a party\nso composed would not have been very bright, but the party at the\nvilla went off very satisfactorily. Ralph made himself popular with\neverybody. He became very popular with Sir Thomas by the frank and\neasy way in which he spoke of the family difficulties at Newton. \"I\nwish my namesake knew my father,\" he said, when he was alone with the\nlawyer after dinner. He never spoke of either of these Newtons as his\ncousins, though to Gregory, whom he knew well and loved dearly, he\nwould declare that from him he felt entitled to exact all the dues of\ncousinship.\n\n\"It would be desirable,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"I never give it up. You know my father, I dare say. He thought\nhis brother interfered with him, and I suppose he did. But a more\naffectionate or generous man never lived. He is quite as fond of\nGregory as he is of me, and would do anything on earth that Gregory\ntold him. He is rebuilding the chancel of the church just because\nGregory wishes it. Some day I hope they may be reconciled.\"\n\n\"It is hard to get over money difficulties,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"I don't see why there should be money difficulties,\" said Ralph. \"As\nfar as I am concerned there need be none.\"\n\n\"Ralph Newton has made money difficulties,\" said Sir Thomas. \"If\nhe had been careful with his own fortune there would have been no\nquestion as to the property between him and your father.\"\n\n\"I can understand that;--and I can understand also my father's\nanxiety, though I do not share it. It would be better that my\nnamesake should have the estate. I can see into these matters quite\nwell enough to know that were it to be mine there would occur exactly\nthat which my father wishes to avoid. I should be the owner of Newton\nPriory, and people would call me Mr. Newton. But I shouldn't be\nNewton of Newton. It had better go to Ralph. I should live elsewhere,\nand people would not notice me then.\"\n\nSir Thomas, as he looked up at the young man, leaning back in his\narm-chair and holding his glass half full of wine in his hand, could\nnot but tell himself that the greater was the pity. This off-shoot\nof the Newton stock, who declared of himself that he never could be\nNewton of Newton, was a fine, manly fellow to look at,--not handsome\nas was Ralph the heir, not marked by that singular mixture of\ngentleness, intelligence, and sweetness which was written, not only\non the countenance, but in the demeanour and very step of Gregory;\nbut he was a bigger man than either of them, with a broad chest, and\na square brow, and was not without that bright gleam of the Newton\nblue eye, which characterised all the family. And there was so much\nof the man in him;--whereas, in manhood, Ralph the heir had certainly\nbeen deficient. \"Ralph must lie on the bed that he has made,\" said\nSir Thomas. \"And you, of course, will accept the good things that\ncome in your way. As far as I can see at present it will be best for\nRalph that your father should redeem from him a portion, at least, of\nthe property. The girls are waiting for us to go out, and perhaps you\nwill like a cigar on the lawn.\"\n\nIt was clear to every one there to see that this other Newton greatly\nadmired the West Indian cousin. And Mary, with this newcomer, seemed\nto talk on easier terms than she had ever done before since she had\nbeen at Fulham. She smiled, and listened, and was gracious, and made\nthose pleasant little half-affected sallies which girls do make to\nmen when they know that they are admired, and are satisfied that it\nshould be so. All the story had been told to her, and it might be\nthat the poor orphan felt that she was better fitted to associate\nwith the almost nameless one than with the true heir of the family.\nMr. Newton, when he got up to leave them, asked permission to come\nagain, and left them all with a pleasant air of intimacy. Two boats\nhad passed them, racing on the river, almost close to the edge of\ntheir lawn, and Newton had offered to bet with Mary as to which would\nfirst reach the bridge. \"I wish you had taken my wager, Miss Bonner,\"\nhe said, \"because then I should have been bound to come back at once\nto pay you.\" \"That's all very well, Mr. Newton,\" said Mary, \"but I\nhave heard of gentlemen who are never seen again when they lose.\"\n\"Mr. Newton is unlike that, I'm sure,\" said Clary; \"but I hope he'll\ncome again at any rate.\" Newton promised that he would, and was fully\ndetermined to keep his promise when he made it.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be delightful if they were to fall in love with each\nother and make a match of it?\" said Clary to her sister.\n\n\"I don't like to plot and plan such things,\" said Patience.\n\n\"I don't like to scheme, but I don't see any harm in planning. He is\never so nice,--isn't he?\"\n\n\"I thought him very pleasant.\"\n\n\"Such an open-spoken, manly, free sort of fellow. And he'll be very\nwell off, you know.\"\n\n\"I don't know;--but I dare say he will,\" said Patience.\n\n\"Oh yes, you do. Poor Ralph, our Ralph, is a spendthrift, and I\nshouldn't wonder if this one were to have the property after all.\nAnd then his father is very rich. I know that because Gregory told\nme. Dear me! wouldn't it be odd if we were all three to become Mrs.\nNewtons?\"\n\n\"Clary, what did I tell you?\"\n\n\"Well; I won't. But it would be odd,--and so nice, at least I think\nso. Well;--I dare say I ought not to say it. But then I can't help\nthinking it,--and surely I may tell you what I think.\"\n\n\"I would think it as little as I could, dear.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's very well. A girl can be a hypocrite if she pleases,\nand perhaps she ought. Of course I shall be a hypocrite to all\nthe world except you. I tell you what it is, Patty;--you make me\ntell you everything, and say that of course you and I are to tell\neverything,--and then you scold me. Don't you want me to tell you\neverything?\"\n\n\"Indeed I do;--and I won't scold you. Dear Clary, do I scold you?\nWouldn't I give one of my eyes to make you happy?\"\n\n\"That's quite a different thing,\" said Clarissa.\n\nThree days afterwards Mr. Ralph Newton;--it is hoped that the reader\nmay understand the attempts which are made to designate the two young\nmen;--Mr. Ralph Newton appeared again at Popham Villa. He came in\nalmost with the gait of an old friend, and brought some fern leaves,\nwhich he had already procured from Hampshire, in compliance with a\npromise which he had made to Patience Underwood. \"That's what we\ncall the hart's tongue,\" said he, \"though I fancy they give them all\ndifferent names in different places.\"\n\n\"It's the same plant as ours, Mr. Newton,--only yours is larger.\"\n\n\"It's the ugliest of all the ferns,\" said Clary.\n\n\"Even that's a compliment,\" said Newton. \"It's no use transplanting\nthem in this weather, but I'll send you a basket in October. You\nshould come down to Newton and see our ferns. We think we're very\npretty, but because we're so near, nobody comes to see us.\" Then he\nfell a-talking with Mary Bonner, and stayed at the villa nearly all\nthe afternoon. For a moment or two he was alone with Clarissa, and at\nonce expressed his admiration. \"I don't think I ever saw such perfect\nbeauty as your cousin's,\" he said.\n\n\"She is handsome.\"\n\n\"And then she is so fair, whereas everybody expects to see dark eyes\nand black hair come from the West Indies.\"\n\n\"But Mary wasn't born there.\"\n\n\"That doesn't matter. The mind doesn't travel back as far as that.\nA negro should be black, and an American thin, and a French woman\nshould have her hair dragged up by the roots, and a German should be\nbroad-faced, and a Scotchman red-haired,--and a West Indian beauty\nshould be dark and languishing.\"\n\n\"I'll tell her you say so, and perhaps she'll have herself altered.\"\n\n\"Whatever you do, don't let her be altered,\" said Mr. Newton. \"She\ncan't be changed for the better.\"\n\n\"I am quite sure he is over head and ears in love,\" said Clarissa to\nPatience that evening.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nTHE CHESHIRE CHEESE.\n\n\n\"Labour is the salt of the earth, and Capital is the sworn foe to\nLabour.\" Hear, hear, hear, with the clattering of many glasses, and\nthe smashing of certain pipes! Then the orator went on. \"That Labour\nshould be the salt of the earth has been the purpose of a beneficent\nCreator;--that Capital should be the foe to Labour has been\nman's handywork. The one is an eternal decree, which nothing can\nchange,--which neither the good nor the evil done by man can affect.\nThe other is an evil ordinance, the fruit of man's ignorance and\nwithin the scope of man's intellect to annul.\" Mr. Ontario Moggs\nwas the orator, and he was at this moment addressing a crowd of\nsympathising friends in the large front parlour of the Cheshire\nCheese. Of all those who were listening to Ontario Moggs there was\nnot probably one who had reached a higher grade in commerce than that\nof an artizan working for weekly wages;--but Mr. Moggs was especially\nendeared to them because he was not an artizan working for weekly\nwages, but himself a capitalist. His father was a master bootmaker on\na great scale;--for none stood much higher in the West-end trade than\nBooby and Moggs; and it was known that Ontario was the only child\nand heir, and as it were sole owner of the shoulders on which must\nsome day devolve the mantle of Booby and Moggs. Booby had long been\ngathered to his fathers, and old Moggs was the stern opponent of\nstrikes. What he had lost by absolutely refusing to yield a point\nduring the last strike among the shoemakers of London no one could\ntell. He had professed aloud that he would sooner be ruined, sooner\ngive up his country residence at Shepherd's Bush, sooner pull down\nthe honoured names of Booby and Moggs from over the shop-window in\nOld Bond Street, than allow himself to be driven half an inch out\nof his course by men who were attempting to dictate to him what he\nshould do with his own. In these days of strikes Moggs would look\neven upon his own workmen with the eyes of a Coriolanus glaring upon\nthe disaffected populace of Rome. Mr. Moggs senior would stand at his\nshop-door, with his hand within his waistcoat, watching the men out\non strike who were picketing the streets round his shop, and would\nfeel himself every inch a patrician, ready to die for his order. Such\nwas Moggs senior. And Moggs junior, who was a child of Capital, but\nwhose heirship depended entirely on his father's will, harangued his\nfather's workmen and other workmen at the Cheshire Cheese, telling\nthem that Labour was the salt of the earth, and that Capital was\nthe foe to Labour! Of course they loved him. The demagogue who\nis of all demagogues the most popular, is the demagogue who is a\ndemagogue in opposition to his apparent nature. The radical Earl,\nthe free-thinking parson, the squire who won't preserve, the tenant\nwho defies his landlord, the capitalist with a theory for dividing\nprofits, the Moggs who loves a strike,--these are the men whom the\nworking men delight to follow. Ontario Moggs, who was at any rate\nhonest in his philanthropy, and who did in truth believe that it was\nbetter that twenty real bootmakers should eat beef daily than that\none so-called bootmaker should live in a country residence,--who\nbelieved this and acted on his belief, though he was himself not\nof the twenty, but rather the one so-called bootmaker who would\nsuffer by the propagation of such a creed,--was beloved and almost\nworshipped by the denizens of the Cheshire Cheese. How far the real\nphilanthropy of the man may have been marred by an uneasy and fatuous\nambition; how far he was carried away by a feeling that it was better\nto make speeches at the Cheshire Cheese than to apply for payment of\nmoney due to his father, it would be very hard for us to decide. That\nthere was an alloy even in Ontario Moggs is probable;--but of this\nalloy his hearers knew nothing. To them he was a perfect specimen of\nthat combination, which is so grateful to them, of the rich man's\nposition with the poor man's sympathies. Therefore they clattered\ntheir glasses, and broke their pipes, and swore that the words he\nuttered were the kind of stuff they wanted.\n\n\"The battle has been fought since man first crawled upon the earth,\"\ncontinued Moggs, stretching himself to his full height and pointing\nto the farthest confines of the inhabited globe;--\"since man first\ncrawled upon the earth.\" There was a sound in that word \"crawl\"\ntypical of the abject humility to which working shoemakers were\nsubjected by their employers, which specially aroused the feelings\nof the meeting. \"And whence comes the battle?\" The orator paused,\nand the glasses were jammed upon the table. \"Yes,--whence comes the\nbattle, in fighting which hecatombs of honest labourers have been\ncrushed till the sides of the mountains are white with their bones,\nand the rivers run foul with their blood? From the desire of one\nman to eat the bread of two?\" \"That's it,\" said a lean, wizened,\npale-faced little man in a corner, whose trembling hand was resting\non a beaker of gin and water. \"Yes, and to wear two men's coats and\ntrousers, and to take two men's bedses and the wery witals out of two\nmen's bodies. D---- them!\" Ontario, who understood something of his\ntrade as an orator, stood with his hand still stretched out, waiting\ntill this ebullition should be over. \"No, my friend,\" said he, \"we\nwill not damn them. I for one will damn no man. I will simply rebel.\nOf all the sacraments given to us, the sacrament of rebellion is the\nmost holy.\" Hereupon the landlord of the Cheshire Cheese must have\nfeared for his tables, so great was the applause and so tremendous\nthe thumping;--but he knew his business, no doubt, and omitted to\ninterfere. \"Of Rebellion, my friends,\" continued Ontario, with his\nright hand now gracefully laid across his breast, \"there are two\nkinds,--or perhaps we may say three. There is the rebellion of arms,\nwhich can avail us nothing here.\" \"Perhaps it might tho',\" said the\nlittle wizened man in a corner, whose gin and water apparently did\nnot comfort him. To this interruption Ontario paid no attention. \"And\nthere is the dignified and slow rebellion of moral resistance;--too\nslow I fear for us.\" This point was lost upon the audience, and\nthough the speaker paused, no loud cheer was given. \"It's as true as\ntrue,\" said one man; but he was a vain fellow, simply desirous of\nappearing wiser than his comrades. \"And then there is the rebellion\nof the Strike;\" now the clamour of men's voices, and the kicking of\nmen's feet, and the thumping with men's fists became more frantic\nthan ever;\"--the legitimate rebellion of Labour against its tyrant.\nGentlemen, of all efforts this is the most noble. It is a sacrifice\nof self, a martyrdom, a giving up on the part of him who strikes of\nhimself, his little ones, and his wife, for the sake of others who\ncan only thus be rescued from the grasp of tyranny. Gentlemen, were\nit not for strikes, this would be a country in which no free man\ncould live. By the aid of strikes we will make it the Paradise of\nthe labourer, an Elysium of industry, an Eden of artizans.\" There\nwas much more of it,--but the reader might be fatigued were the full\nflood of Mr. Moggs's oratory to be let loose upon him. And through\nit all there was a germ of truth and a strong dash of true, noble\nfeeling;--but the speaker had omitted as yet to learn how much\nthought must be given to a germ of truth before it can be made to\nproduce fruit for the multitude. And then, in speaking, grand words\ncome so easily, while thoughts,--even little thoughts,--flow so\nslowly!\n\n\n[Illustration: \"The battle has been fought since man first\ncrawled upon the earth,\" continued Moggs, stretching himself\nto his full height and pointing to the farthest confines of\nthe inhabited globe . . .]\n\n\nBut the speech, such as it was, sufficed amply for the immediate\nwants of the denizens of the Cheshire Cheese. There were men there\nwho for the half-hour believed that Ontario Moggs had been born to\nsettle all the difficulties between labourers and their employers,\nand that he would do so in such a way that the labourers, at least,\nshould have all that they wanted. It would be, perhaps, too much to\nsay that any man thought this would come in his own day,--that he so\nbelieved as to put a personal trust in his own belief; but they did\nthink for a while that the good time was coming, and that Ontario\nMoggs would make it come. \"We'll have 'im in parl'ament any ways,\"\nsaid a sturdy, short, dirty-looking artizan, who shook his head as\nhe spoke to show that, on that matter, his mind was quite made up.\n\"I dunno no good as is to cum of sending sich as him to parl'ament,\"\nsaid another. \"Parl'ament ain't the place. When it comes to the p'int\nthey won't 'ave 'em. There was Odgers, and Mr. Beale. I don't b'lieve\nin parl'ament no more.\" \"Kennington Oval's about the place,\" said a\nthird. \"Or Primrose 'ill,\" said a fourth. \"Hyde Park!\" screamed the\nlittle wizen man with the gin and water. \"That's the ticket;--and\ndown with them gold railings. We'll let' em see!\" Nevertheless they\nall went away home in the quietest way in the world, and,--as there\nwas no strike in hand,--got to their work punctually on the next\nmorning. Of all those who had been loudest at the Cheshire Cheese\nthere was not one who was not faithful, and, in a certain way, loyal\nto his employer.\n\nAs soon as his speech was over and he was able to extricate himself\nfrom the crowd, Ontario Moggs escaped from the public-house\nand strutted off through certain narrow, dark streets in the\nneighbourhood, leaning on the arm of a faithful friend. \"Mr. Moggs,\nyou did pitch it rayther strong, to-night,\" said the faithful friend.\n\n\"Pitch it rather strong;--yes. What good do you think can ever come\nfrom pitching any thing weak? Pitch it as strong as you will, find it\ndon't amount to much.\"\n\n\"But about rebellion, now, Mr. Moggs? Rebellion ain't a good thing,\nsurely, Mr. Moggs.\"\n\n\"Isn't it? What was Washington, what was Cromwell, what was Rienzi,\nwhat was,--was,--; but never mind,\" said Ontario, who could not at\nthe moment think of the name of his favourite Pole.\n\n\"And you think as the men should be rebels again' the masters?\"\n\n\"That depends on who the masters are, Waddle.\"\n\n\"What good 'd cum of it if I rebelled again' Mr. Neefit, and told him\nup to his face as I wouldn't make up the books? He'd only sack me. I\nfind thirty-five bob a week, with two kids and their mother to keep\non it, tight enough, Mr. Moggs. If I 'ad the fixing on it, I should\nsay forty bob wasn't over the mark;--I should indeed. But I don't see\nas I should get it.\"\n\n\"Yes you would;--if you earned it, and stuck to your purpose. But\nyou're a single stick, and it requires a faggot to do this work.\"\n\n\"I never could see it, Mr. Moggs. All the same I do like to hear you\ntalk. It stirs one up, even though one don't just go along with it.\nYou won't let on, you know, to Mr. Neefit as I was there.\"\n\n\"And why not?\" said Ontario, turning sharp upon his companion.\n\n\"The old gen'leman hates the very name of a strike. He's a'most as\nbad as your own father, Mr. Moggs.\"\n\n\"You have done his work to-day. You have earned your bread. You owe\nhim nothing.\"\n\n\"That I don't, Mr. Moggs. He'll take care of that.\"\n\n\"And yet you are to stay away from this place, or go to that, to suit\nhis pleasure. Are you Neefit's slave?\"\n\n\"I'm just the young man in his shop,--that's all.\"\n\n\"As long as that is all, Waddle, you are not worthy to be called a\nman.\"\n\n\"Mr. Moggs, you're too hard. As for being a man, I am a man.\nI've a wife and two kids. I don't think more of my governor than\nanother;--but if he sacked me, where 'd I get thirty-five bob\na-week?\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Waddle;--it's true. I should not have said it.\nPerhaps you do not quite understand me, but your position is one of\na single stick, rather than of the faggot. Ah me! She hasn't been at\nthe shop lately?\"\n\n\"She do come sometimes. She was there the day before yesterday.\"\n\n\"And alone?\"\n\n\"She come alone, and she went home with the governor.\"\n\n\"And he?\"\n\n\"Mr. Newton, you mean?\"\n\n\"Has he been there?\"\n\n\"Well;--yes; he was there once last week.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"There was words;--that's what there was. It ain't going smooth, and\nhe ain't been out there no more,--not as I knows on. I did say a word\nonce or twice as to the precious long figure as he stands for on our\nbooks. Over two hundred for breeches is something quite stupendous.\nIsn't it, Mr. Moggs?\"\n\n\"And what did Neefit say?\"\n\n\"Just snarled at me. He can show his teeth, you know, and look as\nbitter as you like. It ain't off, because when I just named the very\nheavy figure in such a business as ours,--he only snarled. But it\nain't on, Mr. Moggs. It ain't what I call,--on.\" After this they\nwalked on in silence for a short way, when Mr. Waddle made a little\nproposition. \"He's on your books, too, Mr. Moggs, pretty tight, as\nI'm told. Why ain't you down on him?\"\n\n\"Down on him?\" said Moggs.\n\n\"I wouldn't leave him an hour, if I was you.\"\n\n\"D'you think that's the way I would be down on,--a rival?\" and Moggs,\nas he walked along, worked both his fists closely in his energy. \"If\nI can't be down on him other gait than that, I'll leave him alone.\nBut, Waddle, by my sacred honour as a man, I'll not leave him alone!\"\nWaddle started, and stood with his mouth open, looking up at his\nfriend. \"Base, mercenary, false-hearted loon! What is it that he\nwants?\"\n\n\"Old Neefit's money. That's it, you know.\"\n\n\"He doesn't know what love means, and he'd take that fair creature,\nand drag her through the dirt, and subject her to the scorn\nof hardened aristocrats, and crush her spirits, and break her\nheart,--just because her father has scraped together a mass of gold.\nBut I,--I wouldn't let the wind blow on her too harshly. I despise\nher father's money. I love her. Yes;--I'll be down upon him somehow.\nGood-night, Waddle. To come between me and the pride of my heart for\na little dirt! Yes; I'll be down upon him.\" Waddle stood and admired.\nHe had read of such things in books, but here it was brought home to\nhim in absolute life. He had a young wife whom he loved, but there\nhad been no poetry about his marriage. One didn't often come across\nreal poetry in the world,--Waddle felt;--but when one did, the treat\nwas great. Now Ontario Moggs was full of poetry. When he preached\nrebellion it was very grand,--though at such moments Waddle was apt\nto tell himself that he was precluded by his two kids from taking an\nactive share in such poetry as that. But when Moggs was roused to\nspeak of his love, poetry couldn't go beyond that. \"He'll drop into\nthat customer of ours,\" said Waddle to himself, \"and he'll mean\nit when he's a doing of it. But Polly 'll never 'ave 'im.\" And\nthen there came across Waddle's mind an idea which he could not\nexpress,--that of course no girl would put up with a bootmaker who\ncould have a real gentleman. Real gentlemen think a good deal of\nthemselves, but not half so much as is thought of them by men who\nknow that they themselves are of a different order.\n\nOntario Moggs, as he went homewards by himself, was disturbed by\nvarious thoughts. If it really was to be the case that Polly Neefit\nwouldn't have him, why should he stay in a country so ill-adapted to\nhis manner of thinking as this? Why remain in a paltry island while\nall the starry west, with its brilliant promises, was open to him?\nHere he could only quarrel with his father, and become a rebel, and\nperhaps live to find himself in a jail. And then what could he do of\ngood? He preached and preached, but nothing came of it. Would not\nthe land of the starry west suit better such a heart and such a mind\nas his? But he wouldn't stir while his fate was as yet unfixed in\nreference to Polly Neefit. Strikes were dear to him, and oratory, and\nthe noisy applauses of the Cheshire Cheese; but nothing was so dear\nto him as Polly Neefit. He went about the world with a great burden\nlying on his chest, and that burden was his love for Polly Neefit.\nIn regard to strikes and the ballot he did in a certain way reason\nwithin himself and teach himself to believe that he had thought out\nthose matters; but as to Polly he thought not at all. He simply loved\nher, and felt himself to be a wild, frantic man, quarrelling with his\nfather, hurrying towards jails and penal settlements, rushing about\nthe streets half disposed to suicide, because Polly Neefit would have\nnone of him. He had been jealous, too, of the gasfitter, when he had\nseen his Polly whirling round the room in the gasfitter's arms;--but\nthe gasfitter was no gentleman, and the battle had been even. In\nspite of the whirling he still had a chance against the gasfitter.\nBut the introduction of the purple and fine linen element into his\naffairs was maddening to him. With all his scorn for gentry, Ontario\nMoggs in his heart feared a gentleman. He thought that he could make\nan effort to punch Ralph Newton's head if they two were ever to be\nbrought together in a spot convenient for such an operation; but of\nthe man's standing in the world, he was afraid. It seemed to him to\nbe impossible that Polly should prefer him, or any one of his class,\nto a suitor whose hands were always clean, whose shirt was always\nwhite, whose words were soft and well-chosen, who carried with him\nnone of the stain of work. Moggs was as true as steel in his genuine\nlove of Labour,--of Labour with a great L,--of the People with a\ngreat P,--of Trade with a great T,--of Commerce with a great C; but\nof himself individually,--of himself, who was a man of the people,\nand a tradesman, he thought very little when he compared himself to\na gentleman. He could not speak as they spoke; he could not walk as\nthey walked; he could not eat as they ate. There was a divinity about\na gentleman which he envied and hated.\n\nNow Polly Neefit was not subject to this idolatry. Could Moggs\nhave read her mind, he might have known that success, as from the\nbootmaker against the gentleman, was by no means so hopeless an\naffair. What Polly liked was a nice young man, who would hold up his\nhead and be true to her,--and who would not make a fool of himself.\nIf he could waltz into the bargain, that also would Polly like.\n\nOn that night Ontario walked all the way out to Alexandria Cottage,\nand spent an hour leaning upon the gate, looking up at the window\nof the breeches-maker's bedroom;--for the chamber of Polly herself\nopened backwards. When he had stood there an hour, he walked home to\nBond Street.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nRALPH NEWTON'S DOUBTS.\n\n\nThat month of August was a very sad time indeed for Ralph the heir.\nWith him all months were, we may say, idle months; but, as a rule,\nAugust was of all the most idle. Sometimes he would affect to shoot\ngrouse, but hunting, not grouse-shooting, was his passion as a\nsportsman. He would leave London, and spend perhaps a couple of days\nwith Mr. Horsball looking at the nags. Then he would run down to\nsome sea-side place, and flirt and laugh and waste his time upon the\nsands. Or he would go abroad as far as Dieppe, or perhaps Biarritz,\nand so would saunter through the end of the summer. It must not be\nsupposed of him that he was not fully conscious that this manner of\nlife was most pernicious. He knew it well, knew that it would take\nhim to the dogs, made faint resolves at improvement which he hardly\nfor an hour hoped to be able to keep,--and was in truth anything but\nhappy. This was his usual life;--and so for the last three or four\nyears had he contrived to get through this month of August. But now\nthe utmost sternness of business had come upon him. He was forced to\nremain in town, found himself sitting day after day in his lawyer's\nanteroom, was compelled to seek various interviews with Sir Thomas,\nin which it was impossible that Sir Thomas should make himself very\npleasant; and,--worst of all,--was at last told that he must make up\nhis own mind!\n\nSquire Newton was also up in London; and though London was never much\nto his taste, he was in these days by no means so wretched as his\nnephew. He was intent on a certain object, and he began to hope, nay\nto think, that his object might be achieved. He had not once seen his\nnephew, having declared his conviction very strongly that it would be\nbetter for all parties that they should remain apart. His own lawyer\nhe saw frequently, and Ralph's lawyer once, and Sir Thomas more than\nonce or twice. There was considerable delay, but the Squire would\nnot leave London till something was, if not settled, at any rate\narranged, towards a settlement. And it was the expression of his will\nconveyed through the two lawyers which kept Ralph in London. What was\nthe worth of Ralph's interest in the property? That was one great\nquestion. Would Ralph sell that interest when the price was fixed?\nThat was the second question. Ralph, to whom the difficulty of giving\nan answer was as a labour of Hercules, staved off the evil day for\nawhile by declaring that he must know what was the price before he\ncould say whether he would sell the article. The exact price could\nnot be fixed. The lawyers combined in saying that the absolute sum\nof money to include all Ralph's interest in the estate could not be\nnamed that side of Christmas. It was not to be thought of that any\nactuary, or valuer, or lawyer, or conveyancer, should dispose of\nso great a matter by a month's work. But something approaching to\na settlement might be made. A sum might be named as a minimum. And\na compact might be made, subject to the arbitration of a sworn\nappraiser. A sum was named. The matter was carried so far, that Ralph\nwas told that he could sign away all his rights by the middle of\nSeptember,--sign away the entire property,--and have his pockets\nfilled with ample funds for the Moonbeam, and all other delights. He\nmight pay off Moggs and Neefit, and no longer feel that Polly,--poor\ndear Polly,--was a millstone round his neck. And he would indeed, in\nthis event, be so well provided, that he did not for a moment doubt\nthat, if he chose so to circumscribe himself, Clarissa Underwood\nmight be his wife. All the savings of the Squire's life would be\nhis,--enough, as the opposing lawyer told him with eager pressing\nwords, to give him an estate of over a thousand a year at once. \"And\nit may be more,--probably will be more,\" said the lawyer. But at the\nvery least a sum approaching to thirty thousand pounds would be paid\nover to him at once. And he might do what he pleased with this. There\nwas still a remnant of his own paternal property sufficient to pay\nhis debts.\n\nBut why should a man whose encumbrances were so trifling, sacrifice\nprospects that were so glorious? Could he not part with a portion\nof the estate,--with the reversion of half of it, so that the house\nof Newton, Newton Priory, with its grouse and paddocks and adjacent\nfarms, might be left to him? If the whole were saleable, surely\nso also must be the half. The third of the money offered to him\nwould more than suffice for all his wants. No doubt he might sell\nthe half,--but not to the Squire, nor could he effect such sale\nimmediately as he would do if the Squire bought it, nor on such\nterms as were offered by the Squire. Money he might raise at once,\ncertainly; but it became by degrees as a thing certain to him, that\nif once he raised money in that way, the estate would fly from him.\nHis uncle was a hale man, and people told him that his own life was\nnot so much better than his uncle's. His uncle had a great object,\nand if Ralph chose to sell at all, that fact would be worth thousands\nto him. But his uncle would not buy the reversion of half or of a\nportion of the property. The Squire at last spoke his mind freely\non this matter to Sir Thomas. \"It shall never be cast in my son's\nteeth,\" he said, \"that his next neighbour is the real man. Early in\nlife I made a mistake, and I have had to pay for it ever since. I am\npaying for it now, and must pay for it to the end. But my paying for\nit will be of small service if my boy has to pay for it afterwards.\"\nSir Thomas understood him and did not press the point.\n\nRalph was nearly driven wild with the need of deciding. Moggs's bill\nat two months was coming due, and he knew that he could expect no\nmercy there. To Neefit's establishment in Conduit Street he had gone\nonce, and had had words,--as Waddle had told to his rival. Neefit\nwas still persistent in his wishes,--still urgent that Newton should\ngo forth to Hendon like a man, and \"pop\" at once. \"I'll tell you\nwhat, Captain,\" said he;--he had taken to calling Ralph Captain, as a\ngoodly familiar name, feeling, no doubt, that Mister was cold between\nfather-in-law and son-in-law, and not quite daring to drop all\nreverential title;--\"if you're a little hard up, as I know you are,\nyou can have three or four hundred if you want it.\" Ralph did want it\nsorely. \"I know how you stand with old Moggs,\" said Neefit, \"and I'll\nsee you all right there.\" Neefit was very urgent. He too had heard\nsomething of these dealings among the lawyers. To have his Polly Mrs.\nNewton of Newton Priory! The prize was worth fighting for. \"Don't let\nthem frighten you about a little ready money, Captain. If it comes to\nthat, other folk has got ready money besides them.\"\n\n\"Your trust in me surprises me,\" said Ralph. \"I already owe you money\nwhich I can't pay you.\"\n\n\"I know where to trust, and I know where not to trust. If you'll once\nsay as how you'll pop the question to Polly, fair and honest, on\nthe square, you shall have five hundred;--bless me, if you shan't.\nIf she don't take you after all, why then I must look for my money\nby-and-bye. If you're on the square with me, Captain, you'll never\nfind me hard to deal with.\"\n\n\"I hope I shall be on the square, at any rate.\"\n\n\"Then you step out to her and pop.\" Hereupon Ralph made a long and\nintricate explanation of his affairs, the object of which was to\nprove to Mr. Neefit that a little more delay was essential. He was so\nenvironed by business and difficulties at the present moment that he\ncould take no immediate step such as Mr. Neefit suggested,--no such\nstep quite immediately. In about another fortnight, or in a month at\nthe furthest, he would be able to declare his purpose. \"And how about\nMoggs?\" said Neefit, putting his hands into his breeches-pocket,\npulling down the corners of his mouth, and fixing his saucer eyes\nfull upon the young man's face. So he stood for some seconds, and\nthen came the words of which Waddle had spoken. Neefit could not\ndisentangle the intricacies of Ralph's somewhat fictitious story; but\nhe had wit enough to know what it meant. \"You ain't on the square,\nCaptain. That's what you ain't,\" he said at last. It must be owned\nthat the accusation was just, and it was made so loudly that Waddle\ndid not at all exaggerate in saying that there had been words.\nNevertheless, when Ralph left the shop Neefit relented. \"You come to\nme, Captain, when Moggs's bit of stiff comes round.\"\n\nA few days after that Ralph went to Sir Thomas, with the object of\ndeclaring his decision;--at least Sir Thomas understood that such\nwas to be the purport of the visit. According to his ideas there\nhad been quite enough of delay. The Squire had been liberal in his\noffer; and though the thing to be sold was in all its bearings so\nvaluable, though it carried with it a value which, in the eyes of\nSir Thomas,--and, indeed, in the eyes of all Englishmen,--was far\nbeyond all money price, though the territorial position was, for a\nlegitimate heir, almost a principality; yet, when a man cannot keep a\nthing, what can he do but part with it? Ralph had made his bed, and\nhe must lie upon it. Sir Thomas had done what he could, but it had\nall amounted to nothing. There was this young man a beggar,--but for\nthis reversion which he had now the power of selling. As for that\nmode of extrication by marrying the breeches-maker's daughter,--that\nto Sir Thomas was infinitely the worst evil of the two. Let Ralph\naccept his uncle's offer and he would still be an English gentleman,\nfree to live as such, free to marry as such, free to associate with\nfriends fitting to his habits of life. And he would be a gentleman,\ntoo, with means sufficing for a gentleman's wants. But that escape by\nway of the breeches-maker's daughter would, in accordance with Sir\nThomas's view of things, destroy everything.\n\n\"Well, Ralph,\" he said, sighing, almost groaning, as his late ward\ntook the now accustomed chair opposite to his own.\n\n\"I wish I'd never been born,\" said Ralph, \"and that Gregory stood in\nmy place.\"\n\n\"But you have been born, Ralph. We must take things as we find them.\"\nThen there was a long silence. \"I think, you know, that you should\nmake up your mind one way or the other. Your uncle of course feels\nthat as he is ready to pay the money at once he is entitled to an\nimmediate answer.\"\n\n\"I don't see that at all,\" said Ralph. \"I am under no obligation to\nmy uncle, and I don't see why I am to be bustled by him. He is doing\nnothing for my sake.\"\n\n\"He has, at any rate, the power of retracting.\"\n\n\"Let him retract.\"\n\n\"And then you'll be just where you were before,--ready to fall into\nthe hands of the Jews. If you must part with your property you cannot\ndo so on better terms.\"\n\n\"It seems to me that I shall be selling \u00c2\u00a37,000 a year in land for\nabout \u00c2\u00a31,200 a year in the funds.\"\n\n\"Just so;--that's about it, I suppose. But can you tell me when the\nland will be yours,--or whether it will ever be yours at all? What is\nit that you have got to sell? But, Ralph, it is no good going over\nall that again.\"\n\n\"I know that, Sir Thomas.\"\n\n\"I had hoped you would have come to some decision. If you can save\nthe property of course you ought to do so. If you can live on what\npittance is left to you--\"\n\n\"I can save it.\"\n\n\"Then do save it.\"\n\n\"I can save it by--marrying.\"\n\n\"By selling yourself to the daughter of a man who makes--breeches! I\ncan give you advice on no other point; but I do advise you not to do\nthat. I look upon an ill-assorted marriage as the very worst kind of\nruin. I cannot myself conceive any misery greater than that of having\na wife whom I could not ask my friends to meet.\"\n\nRalph when he heard this blushed up to the roots of his hair. He\nremembered that when he had first mentioned to Sir Thomas his\nsuggested marriage with Polly Neefit he had said that as regarded\nPolly herself he thought that Patience and Clarissa would not\nobject to her. He was now being told by Sir Thomas himself that his\ndaughters would certainly not consent to meet Polly Neefit, should\nPolly Neefit become Mrs. Newton. He, too, had his ideas of his own\nstanding in the world, and had not been slow to assure himself\nthat the woman whom he might choose for his wife would be a fit\ncompanion for any lady,--as long as the woman was neither vicious\nnor disagreeable. He could make any woman a lady; he could, at any\nrate, make Polly Neefit a lady. He rose from his seat, and prepared\nto leave the room in disgust. \"I won't trouble you by coming here\nagain,\" he said.\n\n\"You are welcome, Ralph,\" said Sir Thomas. \"If I could assist you,\nyou would be doubly welcome.\"\n\n\"I know I have been a great trouble to you,--a thankless, fruitless,\nworthless trouble. I shall make up my mind, no doubt, in a day or\ntwo, and I will just write you a line. I need not bother you by\ncoming any more. Of course I think a great deal about it.\"\n\n\"No doubt,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"Unluckily I have been brought up to know the value of what it is\nI have to throw away. It is a kind of thing that a man doesn't do\nwithout some regrets.\"\n\n\"They should have come earlier,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"No doubt;--but they didn't, and it is no use saying anything more\nabout it. Good-day, sir.\" Then he flounced out of the room, impatient\nof that single word of rebuke which had been administered to him.\n\nSir Thomas, as soon as he was alone, applied himself at once to the\nbook which he had reluctantly put aside when he was disturbed. But he\ncould not divest his mind of its trouble, as quickly as his chamber\nhad been divested of the presence of its troubler. He had said\nan ill-natured word, and that grieved him. And then,--was he not\ntaking all this great matter too easily? If he would only put his\nshoulder to the wheel thoroughly might he not do something to save\nthis friend,--this lad, who had been almost as his own son,--from\ndestruction? Would it not be a burden on his conscience to the last\nday of his life that he had allowed his ward to be ruined, when by\nsome sacrifice of his own means he might have saved him? He sat and\nthought of it, but did not really resolve that anything could be\ndone. He was wont to think in the same way of his own children, whom\nhe neglected. His conscience had been pricking him all his life, but\nit hardly pricked him sharp enough to produce consequences.\n\nDuring those very moments in which Ralph was leaving Southampton\nBuildings he had almost made up his mind to go at once to Alexandria\nCottage, and to throw himself and the future fate of Newton Priory at\nthe feet of Polly Neefit. Two incidents in his late interview with\nSir Thomas tended to drive him that way. Sir Thomas had told him that\nshould he marry the daughter of a man who made--breeches, no lady\nwould associate with his wife. Sir Thomas also had seemed to imply\nthat he must sell his property. He would show Sir Thomas that he\ncould have a will and a way of his own. Polly Neefit should become\nhis wife; and he would show the world that no proudest lady in the\nland was treated with more delicate consideration by her husband than\nthe breeches-maker's daughter should be treated by him. And when it\nshould please Providence to decide that the present squire of Newton\nhad reigned long enough over that dominion, he would show the world\nthat he had known something of his own position and the value of his\nown prospects. Then Polly should be queen in the Newton dominions,\nand he would see whether the ordinary world of worshippers would not\ncome and worship as usual. All the same, he did not on that occasion\ngo out to Alexandria Cottage.\n\nWhen he reached his club he found a note from his brother.\n\n\n   Newton Peele, September 8th, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR RALPH,--\n\n   I have been sorry not to have had an answer from you to\n   the letter which I wrote to you about a month ago. Of\n   course I hear of what is going on. Ralph Newton up at the\n   house tells me everything. The Squire is still in town,\n   as, of course, you know; and there has got to be a report\n   about here that he has, as the people say, bought you out.\n   I still hope that this is not true. The very idea of it\n   is terrible to me;--that you should sell for an old song,\n   as it were, the property that has belonged to us for\n   centuries! It would not, indeed, go out of the name, but,\n   as far as you and I are concerned, that is the same. I\n   will not refuse, myself, to do anything that you may say\n   is necessary to extricate yourself from embarrassment; but\n   I ran hardly bring myself to believe that a step so fatal\n   as this can be necessary.\n\n   If I understand the matter rightly your difficulty is not\n   so much in regard to debts as in the want of means of\n   livelihood. If so, can you not bring yourself to live\n   quietly for a term of years. Of course you ought to marry,\n   and there may be a difficulty there; but almost anything\n   would be better than abandoning the property. As I told\n   you before, you are welcome to the use of the whole of my\n   share of the London property. It is very nearly \u00c2\u00a3400 a\n   year. Could you not live on that till things come round?\n\n   Our cousin Ralph knows that I am writing to you, and knows\n   what my feelings are. It is not he that is so anxious for\n   the purchase. Pray write and tell me what is to be done.\n\n   Most affectionately yours,\n\n   GREGORY NEWTON.\n\n   I wouldn't lose a day in doing anything you might direct\n   about the Holborn property.\n\n\nRalph received this at his club, and afterwards dined alone,\nconsidering it. Before the evening was over he thought that he had\nmade up his mind that he would not, under any circumstances, give up\nhis reversionary right. \"They couldn't make me do it, even though I\nwent to prison,\" he said to himself. Let him starve till he died, and\nthen the property would go to Gregory! What did it matter? The thing\nthat did matter was this,--that the estate should not be allowed to\ndepart out of the true line of the Newton family. He sat thinking of\nit half the night, and before he left the club he wrote the following\nnote to his brother;--\n\n\n   September 9th, 186--.\n\n   DEAR GREG.,--\n\n   Be sure of this,--that I will not part with my interest in\n   the property. I do not think that I can be forced, and I\n   will never do it willingly. It may be that I may be driven\n   to take advantage of your liberality and prudence. If so,\n   I can only say that you shall share the property with me\n   when it comes.\n\n   Yours always,\n\n   R. N.\n\n\nThis he gave to the porter of the club as he passed out; and then, as\nhe went home, he acknowledged to himself that it was tantamount to a\ndecision on his part that he would forthwith marry Polly Neefit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nWE WON'T SELL BROWNRIGGS.\n\n\nOn the 10th of September the Squire was informed that Ralph Newton\ndemanded another ten days for his decision, and that he had\nundertaken to communicate it by letter on the 20th. The Squire\nhad growled, thinking that his nephew was unconscionable, and had\nthreatened to withdraw his offer. The lawyer, with a smile, assured\nhim that the matter really was progressing very quickly, that things\nof that kind could rarely be carried on so expeditiously; and that,\nin short, Mr. Newton had no fair ground of complaint. \"When a man\npays through the nose for his whistle, he ought to get it!\" said the\nSquire, plainly showing that his idea as to the price fixed was very\ndifferent from that entertained by his nephew. But he did not retract\nhis offer. He was too anxious to accomplish the purchase to do that.\nHe would go home, he said, and wait till the 20th. Then he would\nreturn to London. And he did go home.\n\nOn the first evening he said very little to his son. He felt that his\nson did not quite sympathise with him, and he was sore that it should\nbe so. He could not be angry with his son. He knew well that this\nwant of sympathy arose from a conviction on this son's part that, let\nwhat might be done in regard to the property, nothing could make him,\nwho was illegitimate, capable of holding the position in the country\nwhich of right belonged to Newton of Newton. But the presence of this\nfeeling in the mind of the son was an accusation against himself\nwhich was very grievous to him. Almost every act of his latter\nlife had been done with the object of removing the cause for such\naccusation. To make his boy such as he would have been in every\nrespect had not his father sinned in his youth, had been the one\nobject of the father's life. And nobody gainsayed him in this but\nthat son himself. Nobody told him that all his bother about the\nestate was of no avail. Nobody dared to tell him so. Parson Gregory,\nin his letters to his brother, could express such an opinion. Sir\nThomas, sitting alone in his chamber, could feel it. Ralph, the\nlegitimate heir, with an assumed scorn, could declare to himself\nthat, let what might be sold, he would still be Newton of Newton. The\ncountry people might know it, and the farmers might whisper it one\nto another. But nobody said a word of this to the Squire. His own\nlawyer never alluded to such a matter, though it was of course in his\nthoughts. Nevertheless, the son, whom he loved so well, would tell\nhim from day to day,--indirectly, indeed, but with words that were\nplain enough,--that the thing was not to be done. Men and women\ncalled him Newton, because his father had chosen so to call him;--as\nthey would have called him Tomkins or Montmorenci, had he first\nappeared before them with either of those names; but he was not a\nNewton, and nothing could make him Newton of Newton Priory,--not even\nthe possession of the whole parish, and an habitation in the Priory\nitself. \"I wish you wouldn't think about it,\" the son would say to\nthe father;--and the expression of such a wish would contain the\nwhole accusation. What other son would express a desire that the\nfather would abstain from troubling himself to leave his estate\nentire to his child?\n\nOn the morning after his return the necessary communication was made.\nBut it was not commenced in any set form. The two were out together,\nas was usual with them, and were on the road which divided the two\nparishes, Bostock from Newton. On the left of them was Walker's farm,\ncalled the Brownriggs; and on the right, Darvell's farm, which was in\ntheir own peculiar parish of Newton. \"I was talking to Darvell while\nyou were away,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"What does he say for himself?\"\n\n\"Nothing. It's the old story. He wants to stay, though he knows he'd\nbe better away.\"\n\n\"Then let him stay. Only I must have the place made fit to look at. A\nman should have a chance of pulling through.\"\n\n\"Certainly, sir. I don't want him to go. I was only thinking it would\nbe better for his children that there should be a change. As for\nmaking the place fit to look at, he hasn't the means. It's Walker's\nwork, at the other side, that shames him.\"\n\n\"One can't have Walkers on every farm,\" said the Squire. \"No;--if\nthings go, as I think they will go, we'll pull down every stick and\nstone at Brumby's,\"--Brumby's was the name of Darvell's farm,--\"and\nput it up all ship-shape. The house hasn't been touched these twenty\nyears.\" Ralph said nothing. He knew well that his father would not\ntalk of building unless he intended to buy before he built. Nothing\ncould be more opposed to the Squire's purposes in life than the idea\nof building a house which, at his death, would become the property of\nhis nephew. And, in this way, the estate was being starved. All this\nRalph understood thoroughly; and, understanding it, had frequently\nexpressed a desire that his father and the heir could act in accord\ntogether. But now the Squire talked of pulling down and building\nup as though the property were his own, to do as he liked with it.\n\"And I think I can do it without selling Brownriggs,\" continued\nthe Squire. \"When it came to black and white, the value that he\nhas in it doesn't come to so much as I thought.\" Still Ralph said\nnothing,--nothing, at least, as to the work that had been done\nup in London. He merely made some observation as to Darvell's\nfarm;--suggesting that a clear half year's rent should be given to\nthe man. \"I have pretty well arranged it all in my mind,\" continued\nthe Squire. \"We could part with Twining. It don't lie so near as\nBrownriggs.\"\n\nRalph felt that it would be necessary that he should say something.\n\"Lord Fitzadam would be only too glad to buy it. He owns every acre\nin the parish except Ingram's farm.\"\n\n\"There'll be no difficulty about selling it,--when we have the power\nto sell. It'll fetch thirty years' purchase. I'd give thirty years'\npurchase for it, at the present rent myself, if I had the money.\nLord Fitzadam shall have it, if he pleases, of course. There's four\nhundred acres of it.\"\n\n\"Four hundred and nine,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"And it's worth over twelve thousand pounds. It would have gone\nagainst the grain with me to part with any of the land in Bostock;\nbut I think we can squeeze through without that.\"\n\n\"Is it arranged, sir?\" asked the son at last.\n\n\"Well;--no; I can't say it is. He is to give me his answer on the\n20th. But I cannot see that he has any alternative. He must pay his\ndebts, and he has no other way of paying them. He must live, and he\nhas nothing else to live on. A fellow like that will have money,\nif he can lay his hands on it, and he can't lay his hands on it\nelsewhere. Of course he could get money; but he couldn't get it on\nsuch terms as I have offered him. He is to have down thirty thousand\npounds, and then,--after that,--I am to pay him whatever more than\nthat they may think the thing is worth to him. Under no circumstances\nis he to have less. It's a large sum of money, Ralph.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed;--though not so much as you had expected, sir.\"\n\n\"Well,--no; but then there are drawbacks. However, I shall only be\ntoo glad to have it settled. I don't think, Ralph, you have ever\nrealised what it has been for me not to be able to lay out a shilling\non the property, as to which I was not satisfied that I should see it\nback again in a year or two.\"\n\n\"And yet, sir, I have thought much about it.\"\n\n\"Thought! By heavens, I have thought of nothing else. As I stand\nhere, the place has hardly been worth the having to me, because of\nsuch thinking. Your uncle, from the very first, was determined to\nmake it bitter enough. I shall never forget his coming to me when I\ncut down the first tree. Was I going to build houses for a man's son\nwho begrudged me the timber I wanted about the place?\"\n\n\"He couldn't stop you there.\"\n\n\"But he said he could,--and he tried. And if I wanted to change a\nthing here or there, was it pleasant, do you think, to have to go to\nhim? And what pleasure could there be in doing anything when another\nwas to have it all? But you have never understood it, Ralph. Well;--I\nhope you'll understand it some day. If this goes right, nobody shall\never stop you in cutting a tree. You shall be free to do what you\nplease with every sod, and every branch, and every wall, and every\nbarn. I shall be happy at last, Ralph, if I think that you can enjoy\nit.\" Then there was again a silence, for tears were in the eyes both\nof the father and of the son. \"Indeed,\" continued the Squire, as he\nrubbed the moisture away, \"my great pleasure, while I remain, will be\nto see you active about the place. As it is now, how is it possible\nthat you should care for it?\"\n\n\"But I do care for it, and I think I am active about it.\"\n\n\"Yes,--making money for that idiot, who is to come after me. But I\ndon't think he ever will come. I dare say he won't be ashamed to\nshoot your game and drink your claret, if you'll allow him. For the\nmatter of that, when the thing is settled he may come and drink\nmy wine if he pleases. I'll be his loving uncle then, if he don't\nobject. But as it is now;--as it has been, I couldn't have borne\nhim.\"\n\nEven yet there had been no clear statement as to what had been done\nbetween father and son. There was so much of clinging, trusting,\nperfect love in the father's words towards the son, that the latter\ncould not bear to say a word that should produce sorrow. When the\nSquire declared that Ralph should have it all, free,--to do just as\nhe pleased with it, with all the full glory of ownership, Ralph could\nnot bring himself to throw a doubt upon the matter. And yet he did\ndoubt;--more than doubted;--felt almost certain that his father was\nin error. While his father had remained alone up in town he had been\nliving with Gregory, and had known what Gregory thought and believed.\nHe had even seen his namesake's letter to Gregory, in which it was\npositively stated that the reversion would not be sold. Throughout\nthe morning the Squire went on speaking of his hopes, and saying that\nthis and that should be done the very moment that the contract was\nsigned; at last Ralph spoke out, when, on some occasion, his father\nreproached him for indifference. \"I do so fear that you will be\ndisappointed,\" he said.\n\n\"Why should I be disappointed?\"\n\n\"It is not for my own sake that I fear, for in truth the arrangement,\nas it stands, is no bar to my enjoyment of the place.\"\n\n\"It is a most absolute bar to mine,\" said the Squire.\n\n\"I fear it is not settled.\"\n\n\"I know that;--but I see no reason why it should not be settled. Do\nyou know any reason?\"\n\n\"Gregory feels sure that his brother will never consent.\"\n\n\"Gregory is all very well. Gregory is the best fellow in the world.\nHad Gregory been in his brother's place I shouldn't have had a\nchance. But Gregory knows nothing about this kind of thing, and\nGregory doesn't in the least understand his brother.\"\n\n\"But Ralph has told him so.\"\n\n\"Ralph will say anything. He doesn't mind what lies he tells.\"\n\n\"I think you are too hard on him,\" said the son.\n\n\"Well;--we shall see. But what is it that Ralph has said? And when\ndid he say it?\" Then the son told the father of the short letter\nwhich the parson had received from his brother, and almost repeated\nthe words of it. And he told the date of the letter, only a day or\ntwo before the Squire's return. \"Why the mischief could he not be\nhonest enough to tell me the same thing, if he had made up his mind?\"\nsaid the Squire, angrily. \"Put it how you will, he is lying either\nto me or to his brother;--probably to both of us. His word either on\none side or on the other is worth nothing. I believe he will take my\nmoney because he wants money, and because he likes money. As for what\nhe says, it is worth nothing. When he has once written his name, he\ncannot go back from it, and there will be comfort in that.\" Ralph\nsaid nothing more. His father had talked himself into a passion, and\nwas quite capable of becoming angry, even with him. So he suggested\nsomething about the shooting for next day, and proposed that the\nparson should be asked to join them. \"He may come if he likes,\" said\nthe Squire, \"but I give you my word if this goes on much longer, I\nshall get to dislike even the sight of him.\" On that very day the\nparson dined with them, and early in the evening the Squire was cold,\nand silent, and then snappish. But he warmed afterwards under the\ndouble influence of his own port-wine, and the thorough sweetness of\nhis nephew's manner. His last words as Gregory left him that night in\nthe hall were as follows:--\"Bother about the church. I'm half sick of\nthe church. You come and shoot to-morrow. Don't let us have any new\nfads about not shooting.\"\n\n\"There are no new fads, uncle Greg, and I'll be with you by twelve\no'clock,\" said the parson.\n\n\"He is very good as parsons go,\" said the Squire as he shut the door.\n\n\"He's as good as gold,\" said the Squire's son.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nPOLLY'S ANSWER.\n\n\nMoggs's bill became due before the 20th of September, and Ralph\nNewton received due notice,--as of course he had known that he would\ndo,--that it had not been cashed at his banker's. How should it be\ncashed at his banker's, seeing that he had not had a shilling there\nfor the last three months? Moggs himself, Moggs senior, came to\nRalph, and made himself peculiarly disagreeable. He had never heard\nof such a thing on the part of a gentleman! Not to have his bill\ntaken up! To have his paper dishonoured! Moggs spoke of it as\nthough the heavens would fall; and he spoke of it, too, as though,\neven should the heavens not fall, the earth would be made a very\ntumultuous and unpleasant place for Mr. Newton, if Mr. Newton did not\nsee at once that these two hundred and odd pounds were forthcoming.\nMoggs said so much that Ralph became very angry, turned him out of\nthe room, and told him that he should have his dirty money on the\nmorrow. On the morrow the dirty money was paid, Ralph having borrowed\nthe amount from Mr. Neefit. Mr. Moggs was quite content. His object\nhad been achieved, and, when the cash was paid, he was quite polite.\nBut Ralph Newton was not happy as he made the payment. He had\ndeclared to himself, after writing that letter to his brother, that\nthe thing was settled by the very declaration made by him therein.\nWhen he assured his brother that he would not sell his interest in\nthe property, he did, in fact, resolve that he would make Polly\nNeefit his wife. And he did no more than follow up that resolution\nwhen he asked Neefit for a small additional advance. His due would\nnot be given to the breeches-maker if it were not acknowledged that\non this occasion he behaved very well. He had told Ralph to come to\nhim when Moggs's \"bit of stiff\" came round. Moggs's \"bit of stiff\"\ndid come round, and \"the Captain\" did as he had been desired to do.\nNeefit wrote out the cheque without saying a word about his daughter.\n\"Do you just run across to Argyle Street, Captain,\" said the\nbreeches-maker, \"and get the stuff in notes.\" For Mr. Neefit's\nbankers held an establishment in Argyle Street. \"There ain't no need,\nyou know, to let on, Captain; is there?\" said the breeches-maker.\nRalph Newton, clearly seeing that there was no need to \"let on,\" did\nas he was bid, and so the account was settled with Mr. Moggs. But now\nas to settling the account with Mr. Neefit? Neefit had his own idea\nof what was right between gentlemen. As the reader knows, he could\nupon an occasion make his own views very clearly intelligible. He was\nneither reticent nor particularly delicate. But there was something\nwithin him which made him give the cheque to Ralph without a word\nabout Polly. That something, let it be what it might, was not lost\nupon Ralph.\n\nAny further doubt on his part was quite out of the question. If his\nmind had not been made up before it must, at least, be made up now.\nHe had twice borrowed Mr. Neefit's money, and on this latter occasion\nhad taken it on the express understanding that he was to propose to\nMr. Neefit's daughter. And then, in this way, and in this way only,\nhe could throw over his uncle and save the property. As soon as he\nhad paid the money to Moggs, he went to his room and dressed himself\nfor the occasion. As he arranged his dress with some small signs\nof an intention to be externally smart, he told himself that it\nsignified nothing at all, that the girl was only a breeches-maker's\ndaughter, and that there was hardly a need that he should take a new\npair of gloves for such an occasion as this. In that he was probably\nright. An old pair of gloves would have done just as well, though\nPolly did like young men to look smart.\n\nHe went out in a hansom of course. A man does not become economical\nbecause he is embarrassed. And as for embarrassment, he need not\ntrouble himself with any further feelings on that score. When once\nhe should be the promised husband of Polly Neefit, he would have no\nscruple about the breeches-maker's money. Why should he, when he did\nthe thing with the very view of getting it? They couldn't expect him\nto be married till next spring at the earliest, and he would take\nanother winter out of himself at the Moonbeam. As the sacrifice\nwas to be made he might as well enjoy all that would come of the\nsacrifice. Then as he sat in the cab he took to thinking whether,\nafter any fashion at all, he did love Polly Neefit. And from that\nhe got to thinking,--not of poor Clary,--but of Mary Bonner. If his\nuncle could at once be translated to his fitting place among the\nimmortals, oh,--what a life might be his! But his uncle was still\nmortal, and,--after all,--Polly Neefit was a very jolly girl.\n\nWhen he got to the house he asked boldly for Miss Neefit. He had told\nhimself that no repulse could be injurious to him. If Mrs. Neefit\nwere to refuse him admission into the house, the breeches-maker\nwould be obliged to own that he had done his best. But there was no\nrepulse. In two minutes he found himself in the parlour, with Polly\nstanding up to receive him. \"Dear me, Mr. Newton; how odd! You might\nhave come weeks running before you'd find me here and mother out.\nShe's gone to fetch father home. She don't do it,--not once a month.\"\nRalph assured her that he was quite contented as it was, and that he\ndid not in the least regret the absence of Mrs. Neefit. \"But she'll\nbe ever so unhappy. She likes to see gentlemen when they call.\"\n\n\"And you dislike it?\" asked Ralph.\n\n\"Indeed I don't then,\" said Polly.\n\nAnd now in what way was he to do it? Would it be well to allude to\nher father's understanding with himself? In the ordinary way of\nlove-making Ralph was quite as much at home as another. He had found\nno difficulty in saying a soft word to Clarissa Underwood, and in\ndoing more than that. But with Polly the matter was different. There\nwas an inappropriateness in his having to do the thing at all, which\nmade it difficult to him,--unless he could preface what he did by an\nallusion to his agreement with her father. He could hardly ask Polly\nto be his wife without giving her some reason for the formation of so\ndesperate a wish on his own part. \"Polly,\" he said at last, \"that was\nvery awkward for us all,--that evening when Mr. Moggs was here.\"\n\n\"Indeed it was, Mr. Newton. Poor Mr. Moggs! He shouldn't have\nstayed;--but mother asked him.\"\n\n\"Has he been here since?\"\n\n\"He was then, and he and I were walking together. There isn't a\nbetter fellow breathing than Ontario Moggs,--in his own way. But he's\nnot company for you, Mr. Newton, of course.\"\n\nRalph quailed at this. To be told that his own boot-maker wasn't\n\"company\" for him,--and that by the young lady whom he intended to\nmake his wife! \"I don't think he is company for you either Polly,\" he\nsaid.\n\n\"Why not, Mr. Newton? He's as good as me. What's the difference\nbetween him and father?\" He wondered whether, when she should be his\nown, he would be able to teach her to call Mr. Neefit her papa. \"Mr.\nNewton, when you know me better, you'll know that I'm not one to give\nmyself airs. I've known Mr. Moggs all my life, and he's equal to me,\nanyways,--only he's a deal better.\"\n\n\"I hope there's nothing more than friendship, Polly.\"\n\n\"What business have you to hope?\"\n\nUpon that theme he spoke, and told her in plain language that his\nreason for so hoping was that he trusted to be able to persuade her\nto become his own wife. Polly, when the word was spoken, blushed ruby\nred, and trembled a little. The thing had come to her, and, after\nall, she might be a real lady if she pleased. She blushed ruby red,\nand trembled, but she said not a word for a while. And then, having\nmade his offer, he began to speak of love. In speaking of it, he was\nurgent enough, but his words had not that sort of suasiveness which\nthey would have possessed had he been addressing himself to Clary\nUnderwood. \"Polly,\" he said, \"I hope you can love me. I will love you\nvery dearly, and do all that I can to make you happy. To me you shall\nbe the first woman in the world. Do you think that you can love me,\nPolly?\"\n\nPolly was, perhaps, particular. She had not quite approved of the\nmanner in which Ontario had disclosed his love, though there had been\nsomething of the eloquence of passion even in that;--and now she\nwas hardly satisfied with Ralph Newton. She had formed to herself,\nperhaps, some idea of a soft, insinuating, coaxing whisper, something\nthat should be half caress and half prayer, but something that should\nat least be very gentle and very loving. Ontario was loving, but he\nwas not gentle. Ralph Newton was gentle, but then she doubted whether\nhe was loving. \"Will you say that it shall be so?\" he asked, standing\nover her, and looking down upon her with his most bewitching smile.\n\nPolly amidst her blushing and her trembling made up her mind that\nshe would say nothing of the kind at this present moment. She would\nlike to be a lady though she was not ashamed of being a tradesman's\ndaughter;--but she would not buy the privilege of being a lady at too\ndear a price. The price would be very high indeed were she to give\nherself to a man who did not love her, and perhaps despised her. And\nthen she was not quite sure that she could love this man herself,\nthough she was possessed of a facility for liking nice young men.\nRalph Newton was well enough in many ways. He was good looking, he\ncould speak up for himself, he did not give himself airs,--and then,\nas she had been fully instructed by her father, he must ultimately\ninherit a large property. Were she to marry him her position would\nbe absolutely that of one of the ladies of the land. But then she\nknew,--she could not but know,--that he sought her because he was in\nwant of money for his present needs. To be made a lady of the land\nwould be delightful; but to have a grand passion,--in regard to which\nPolly would not be satisfied unless there were as much love on one\nside as on the other,--would be more delightful. That latter was\nessentially necessary to her. The man must take an absolute pleasure\nin her company, or the whole thing would be a failure. So she blushed\nand trembled, and thought and was silent. \"Dear Polly, do you mean\nthat you cannot love me?\" said Ralph.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Polly.\n\n\"Will you try?\" demanded Ralph.\n\n\"And I don't know that you can love me.\"\n\n\"Indeed, indeed, I can.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes;--you can say so, I don't doubt. There's a many of them as\ncan say so, and yet it's not in 'em to do it. And there's men as\ndon't know hardly how to say it, and yet it's in their hearts all the\nwhile.\" Polly must have been thinking of Ontario as she made this\nlatter oracular observation.\n\n\"I don't know much about saying it; but I can do it, Polly.\"\n\n\"Oh, as for talking, you can talk. You've been brought up that way.\nYou've had nothing else much to do.\"\n\nShe was very hard upon him, and so he felt it. \"I think that's not\nfair, Polly. What can I say to you better than that I love you, and\nwill be good to you?\"\n\n\"Oh, good to me! People are always good to me. Why shouldn't they?\"\n\n\"Nobody will be so good as I will be,--if you will take me. Tell me,\nPolly, do you not believe me when I say I love you?\"\n\n\"No;--I don't.\"\n\n\"Why should I be false to you?\"\n\n\"Ah;--well;--why? It's not for me to say why. Father's been putting\nyou up to this. That's why.\"\n\n\"Your father could put me up to nothing of the kind if it were not\nthat I really loved you.\"\n\n\"And there's another thing, Mr. Newton.\"\n\n\"What's that, Polly?\"\n\n\"I'm not at all sure that I'm so very fond of you.\"\n\n\"That's unkind.\"\n\n\"Better be true than to rue,\" said Polly. \"Why, Mr. Newton, we don't\nknow anything about each other,--not as yet. I may be, oh, anything\nbad, for what you know. And for anything I know you may be idle, and\nextravagant, and a regular man flirt.\" Polly had a way of speaking\nthe truth without much respect to persons. \"And then, Mr. Newton,\nI'm not going to be given away by father just as he pleases. Father\nthinks this and that, and he means it all for the best. I love father\ndearly. But I don't mean to take any body as I don't feel I'd pretty\nnigh break my heart if I wasn't to have him. I ain't come to breaking\nmy heart for you yet, Mr. Newton.\"\n\n\"I hope you never will break your heart.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose you understand, but that's how it is. Let it just\nstand by for a year or so, Mr. Newton, and see how it is then. Maybe\nwe might get to know each other. Just now, marrying you would be\nlike taking a husband out of a lottery.\" Ralph stood looking at her,\npassing his hand over his head, and not quite knowing how to carry on\nhis suit. \"I'll tell father what you was saying to me and what I said\nto you,\" continued Polly, who seemed quite to understand that Ralph\nhad done his duty by his creditor in making the offer, and that\njustice to him demanded that this should be acknowledged by the whole\nfamily.\n\n\"And is that to be all, Polly?\" asked Ralph in a melancholy voice.\n\n\"All at present, Mr. Newton.\"\n\nRalph, as he returned to London in his cab, felt more hurt by the\ngirl's refusal of him than he would before have thought to be\npossible. He was almost disposed to resolve that he would at once\nrenew the siege and carry it on as though there were no question\nof twenty thousand pounds, and of money borrowed from the\nbreeches-maker. Polly had shown so much spirit in the interview,\nand had looked so well in showing it, had stood up such a perfect\nspecimen of healthy, comely, honest womanhood, that he thought that\nhe did love her. There was, however, one comfort clearly left to him.\nHe had done his duty by old Neefit. The money due must of course\nbe paid;--but he had in good faith done that which he had pledged\nhimself to do in taking the money.\n\nAs to the surrender of the estate there were still left to him four\ndays in which to think of it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nTHE CONSERVATIVES OF PERCYCROSS.\n\n\nEarly in this month of September there had come a proposition to Sir\nThomas, which had thoroughly disturbed him, and made him for a few\ndays a most miserable man. By the tenth of the month, however, he\nhad so far recovered himself as to have made up his mind in regard\nto the proposition with some feeling of triumphant expectation.\nOn the following day he went home to Fulham, and communicated\nhis determination to his eldest daughter in the following words;\n\"Patience, I am going to stand for the borough of Percycross.\"\n\n\"Papa!\"\n\n\"Yes. I dare say I'm a fool for my pains. It will cost me some money\nwhich I oughtn't to spend; and if I get in I don't know that I can do\nany good, or that it can do me any good. I suppose you think I'm very\nwrong?\"\n\n\"I am delighted,--and so will Clary be. I'm so much pleased! Why\nshouldn't you be in Parliament? I have always longed that you should\ngo back to public life, though I have never liked to say so to you.\"\n\n\"It is very kind of you to say it now, my dear.\"\n\n\"And I feel it.\" There was no doubt of that, for, as she spoke, the\ntears were streaming from her eyes. \"But will you succeed? Is there\nto be anybody against you?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear; there is to be somebody against me. In fact, there\nwill be three people against me; and probably I shall not succeed.\nMen such as I am do not have seats offered to them without a contest.\nBut there is a chance. I was down at Percycross for two days last\nweek, and now I've put out an address. There it is.\" Upon which he\nhanded a copy of a placard to his daughter, who read it, no doubt,\nwith more enthusiasm than did any of the free and independent\nelectors to whom it was addressed.\n\nThe story in regard to the borough of Percycross was as follows.\nThere were going forward in the country at this moment preparations\nfor a general election, which was to take place in October. The\nreaders of this story have not as yet been troubled on this head,\nthere having been no connection between that great matter and the\nsmall matters with which our tale has concerned itself. In the\nParliament lately dissolved, the very old borough of Percycross,--or\nPercy St. Cross, as the place was properly called,--had displayed no\npolitical partiality, having been represented by two gentlemen, one\nof whom always followed the conservative leader, and the other the\nliberal leader, into the respective lobbies of the House of Commons.\nThe borough had very nearly been curtailed of the privilege in regard\nto two members in the great Reform Bill which had been initiated\nand perfected and carried through as a whole by the almost unaided\nintellect and exertions of the great reformer of his age; but it had\nhad its own luck, as the Irishmen say, and had been preserved intact.\nNow the wise men of Percycross, rejoicing in their salvation, and\nknowing that there might still be danger before them should they\nventure on a contest,--for bribery had not been unknown in previous\ncontests at Percycross, nor petitions consequent upon bribery; and\nsome men had marvelled that the borough should have escaped so\nlong; and there was now supposed to be abroad a spirit of assumed\nvirtue in regard to such matters under which Percycross might\nstill be sacrificed if Percycross did not look very sharp after\nitself;--thinking of all this, the wise men at Percycross had\nconcluded that it would be better, just for the present, to let\nthings run smoothly, and to return their two old members. When the\nnew broom which was to sweep up the dirt of corruption was not quite\nso new, they might return to the old game,--which was, in truth, a\ngame very much loved in the old town of Percycross. So thought the\nwise men, and for a while it seemed that the wise men were to have\ntheir own way. But there were men at Percycross who were not wise,\nand who would have it that such an arrangement as this showed lack of\nspirit. The conservative foolish men at Percycross began by declaring\nthat they could return two members for the borough if they pleased,\nand that they would do so, unless this and that were conceded to\nthem. The liberal foolish men swore that they were ready for the\nbattle. They would concede nothing, and would stand up and fight if\nthe word concession were named to them. They would not only have one\nmember, but would have half the aldermen, half the town-councillors,\nhalf the mayor, half the patronage in beadles, bell-ringers and\nbumbledom in general. Had the great reformer of the age given them\nhousehold suffrage for nothing? The liberal foolish men of Percycross\ndeclared, and perhaps thought, that they could send two liberal\nmembers to Parliament. And so the borough grew hot. There was\none very learned pundit in those parts, a pundit very learned in\npolitical matters, who thus prophesied to one of the proposed\ncandidates;--\"You'll spend a thousand pounds in the election. You\nwon't get in, of course, but you'll petition. That'll be another\nthousand. You'll succeed there, and disfranchise the borough. It will\nbe a great career, and no doubt you'll find it satisfactory. You\nmustn't show yourself in Percycross afterwards;--that's all.\" But the\nspirit was afloat, and the words of the pundit were of no avail. The\nliberal spirit had been set a going, and men went to work with the\nnew lists of borough voters. By the end of August it was seen that\nthere must be a contest. But who should be the new candidates?\n\nThe old candidates were there,--one on each side: an old Tory and a\nyoung Radical. In telling our tale we will not go back to the old\nsins of the borough, or say aught but good of the past career of the\nmembers. Old Mr. Griffenbottom, the Tory, had been very generous with\nhis purse, and was beloved, doubtless, by many in the borough. It\nis so well for a borough to have some one who is always ready with\na fifty-pound note in this or that need! It is so comfortable in a\nborough to know that it can always have its subscription lists well\nheaded! And the young Radical was popular throughout the county. No\none could take a chair at a mechanics' meeting with better grace or\nmore alacrity, or spin out his half-hour's speech with greater ease\nand volubility. And then he was a born gentleman, which is so great a\nrecommendation for a Radical. So that, in fact, young Mr. Westmacott,\nthough he did not spend so much money as old Griffenbottom,\nwas almost as popular in the borough. There was no doubt about\nGriffenbottom and Westmacott,--if only the borough would have\nlistened to its wise men and confined itself to the political\nguardianship of such excellent representatives! But the foolish men\nprevailed over the wise men, and it was decided that there should be\na contest.\n\nIt was an evil day for Griffenbottom when it was suggested to him\nthat he should bring a colleague with him. Griffenbottom knew what\nthis meant almost as well as the learned pundit whose words we\nhave quoted. Griffenbottom had not been blessed with uncontested\nelections, and had run through many perils. He had spent what he was\naccustomed to call, when speaking of his political position among his\nreally intimate friends, \"a treasure\" in maintaining the borough. He\nmust often have considered within himself whether his whistle was\nworth the price. He had petitioned and been petitioned against, and\nhad had evil things said of him, and had gone through the very heat\nof the fire of political warfare. But he had kept his seat, and now\nat last,--so he thought,--the ease and comfort of an unopposed return\nwas to repay him for everything. Alas! how all this was changed; how\nhis spirits sank within him, when he received that high-toned letter\nfrom his confidential agent, Mr. Trigger, in which he was invited\nto suggest the name of a colleague! \"I'm sure you'll be rejoiced to\nhear, for the sake of the old borough,\" said Mr. Trigger, \"that we\nfeel confident of carrying the two seats.\" Could Mr. Trigger have\nheard the remarks which his patron made on reading that letter,\nMr. Trigger would have thought that Mr. Griffenbottom was the most\nungrateful member of Parliament in the world. What did not Mr.\nGriffenbottom owe to the borough of Percycross? Did he not owe all\nhis position in the world, all his friends, the fact that he was\nto be seen on the staircases of Cabinet Ministers, and that he was\ncalled \"honourable friend\" by the sons of dukes,--did he not owe it\nall to the borough of Percycross? Mr. Trigger and other friends of\nhis, felt secure in their conviction that they had made a man of\nMr. Griffenbottom. Mr. Griffenbottom understood enough of all this\nto answer Mr. Trigger without inserting in his letter any of those\nanathemas which he uttered in the privacy of his own closet. He\ndid, indeed, expostulate, saying, that he would of course suggest\na colleague, if a colleague were required; but did not Mr. Trigger\nand his other friends in the dear old borough think that just at\nthe present moment a pacific line of action would be best for the\ninterests of the dear old borough? Mr. Trigger answered him very\nquickly, and perhaps a little sharply. The Liberals had decided upon\nhaving two men in the field, and therefore a pacific line of action\nwas no longer possible. Mr. Griffenbottom hurried over to the dear\nold borough, still hoping,--but could do nothing. The scent of the\nbattle was in the air, and the foolish men of Percycross were keen\nfor blood. Mr. Griffenbottom smiled and promised, and declared to\nhimself that there was no peace for the politician on this side\nthe grave. He made known his desires,--or the desire rather of the\nborough,--to a certain gentleman connected with a certain club in\nLondon, and the gentleman in question on the following day waited\nupon Sir Thomas. Sir Thomas had always been true \"to the party,\"--so\nthe gentleman in question was good enough to say. Everybody had\nregretted the loss of Sir Thomas from the House. The present\nopportunity of returning to it was almost unparalleled, seeing that\nthing was so nearly a certainty. Griffenbottom had always been at the\ntop of the poll, and the large majority of the new voters were men in\nthe employment of conservative masters. The gentleman in question was\nvery clear in his explanation that there was a complete understanding\non this matter between the employers and employed at Percycross. It\nwas the nature of the Percycross artizan to vote as his master voted.\nThey made boots, mustard, and paper at Percycross. The men in the\nmustard and paper trade were quite safe;--excellent men, who went\nin a line to the poll, and voted just as the master paper-makers\nand master mustard-makers desired. The gentleman from the club\nacknowledged that there was a difficulty about the boot-trade. All\nthe world over, boots do affect radical sentiments. The master\nbootmakers,--there were four in the borough,--were decided; but the\nmen could not be got at with any certainty.\n\n\"Why should you wish to get at them?\" demanded Sir Thomas.\n\n\"No;--of course not; one doesn't wish to get at them,\" said the\ngentleman from the club,--\"particularly as we are safe without them.\"\nThen he went into statistics, and succeeded in proving to Sir Thomas\nthat there would be a hard fight. Sir Thomas, who was much pressed as\nto time, took a day to consider. \"Did Mr. Griffenbottom intend to\nfight the battle with clean hands?\" The gentleman from the club was\neager in declaring that everything would be done in strict accordance\nwith the law. He could give no guarantee as to expenses, but presumed\nit would be about \u00c2\u00a3300,--perhaps \u00c2\u00a3400,--certainly under \u00c2\u00a3500. The\nother party no doubt would bribe. They always did. And on their\nbehalf,--on behalf of Westmacott and Co.,--there would be treating,\nand intimidation, and subornation, and fictitious voting, and every\nsin to which an election is subject. It always was so with the\nLiberals at Percycross. But Sir Thomas might be sure that on his side\neverything would be--\"serene.\" Sir Thomas at last consented to go\ndown to Percycross, and see one or two of his proposed supporters.\n\nHe did go down, and was considerably disgusted. Mr. Trigger took him\nin hand and introduced him to three or four gentlemen in the borough.\nSir Thomas, in his first interview with Mr. Trigger, declared his\npredilection for purity. \"Yes, yes; yes, yes; of course,\" said Mr.\nTrigger. Mr. Trigger, seeing that Sir Thomas had come among them\nas a stranger to whom had been offered the very great honour of\nstanding for the borough of Percycross,--offered to him before\nhe had subscribed a shilling to any of the various needs of the\nborough,--was not disposed to listen to dictation. But Sir Thomas\ninsisted. \"It's as well that we should understand each other at\nonce,\" said Sir Thomas. \"I should throw up the contest in the middle\nof it,--even if I were winning,--if I suspected that money was being\nspent improperly.\" How often has the same thing been said by a\ncandidate, and what candidate ever has thrown up the sponge when he\nwas winning? Mr. Trigger was at first disposed to tell Sir Thomas\nthat he was interfering in things beyond his province. Had it not\nbeen that the day was late, and that the Liberals were supposed to\nbe hard at work,--that the candidate was wanted at once, Mr. Trigger\nwould have shown his spirit. As it was he could only assent with a\ngrowl, and say that he had supposed all that was to be taken as a\nmatter of course.\n\n\"But I desire to have it absolutely understood by all those who act\nwith me in this matter,\" said Sir Thomas. \"At any rate I will not be\npetitioned against.\"\n\n\"Petitions never come to much at Percycross,\" said Mr. Trigger. He\ncertainly ought to have known, as he had had to do with a great many\nof them. Then they started to call upon two or three of the leading\nconservative gentlemen. \"If I were you, I wouldn't say anything about\nthat, Sir Thomas.\"\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\"Well;--bribery and petitions, and the rest of it. Gentlemen when\nthey're consulted don't like to be told of those sort of things.\nThere has been a little of it, perhaps. Who can say?\" Who, indeed, if\nnot Mr. Trigger,--in regard to Percycross? \"But it's better to let\nall that die out of itself. It never came to much in Percycross. I\ndon't think there was ever more than ten shillings to be had for a\nvote. And I've known half-a-crown a piece buy fifty of 'em,\" he added\nemphatically. \"It never was of much account, and it's best to say\nnothing about it.\"\n\n\"It's best perhaps to make one's intentions known,\" said Sir Thomas\nmildly. Mr. Trigger hummed and hawed, and shook his head, and put\nhis hands into his trousers pockets;--and in his heart of hearts he\ndespised Sir Thomas.\n\nOn that day Sir Thomas was taken to see four gentlemen of note in\nPercycross,--a mustard-maker, a paper-maker, and two bootmakers. The\nmustard-maker was very cordial in offering his support. He would do\nanything for the cause. Trigger knew him. The men were all right\nat his mills. Then Sir Thomas said a word. He was a great foe to\nintimidation;--he wouldn't for worlds have the men coerced. The\nmustard-maker laughed cheerily. \"We know what all that comes to at\nPercycross; don't we, Trigger? We shall all go straight from this\nplace;--shan't we, Trigger? And he needn't ask any questions;--need\nhe, Trigger?\" \"Lord 'a mercy, no,\" said Trigger, who was beginning to\nbe disgusted. Then they went on to the paper-maker's.\n\nThe paper-maker was a very polite gentleman, who seemed to take\ngreat delight in shaking Sir Thomas by the hand, and who agreed\nwith energy to every word Sir Thomas said. Trigger stood a little\napart at the paper-maker's, as soon as the introduction had been\nperformed,--perhaps disapproving in part of the paper-maker's\nprinciples. \"Certainly not, Sir Thomas; not for the world, Sir\nThomas. I'm clean against anything of that kind, Sir Thomas,\" said\nthe paper-maker. Sir Thomas assured the paper-maker that he was glad\nto hear it;--and he was glad. As they went to the first bootmaker's,\nMr. Trigger communicated to Sir Thomas a certain incident in the\ncareer of Mr. Spiveycomb, the paper-maker. \"He's got a contract\nfor paper from the 'Walhamshire Herald,' Sir Thomas;--the largest\ncirculation anywhere in these parts. Griffenbottom gets him that; and\nif ere a man of his didn't vote as he bade 'em, he wouldn't keep 'em,\nnot a day. I don't know that we've a man in Percycross so stanch as\nold Spiveycomb.\" This was Mr. Trigger's revenge.\n\nThe first bootmaker had very little to say for himself, and hardly\ngave Sir Thomas much opportunity of preaching his doctrine of purity.\n\"I hope you'll do something for our trade, Sir Thomas,\" said the\nfirst bootmaker. Sir Thomas explained that he did not at present see\nhis way to the doing of anything special for the bootmakers; and then\ntook his leave. \"He's all right,\" said Mr. Trigger. \"He means it.\nHe's all right. And he'll say a word to his men too, though I don't\nknow that much 'll come of it. They're a rum lot. If they're put out\nhere to-day, they can get in there to-morrow. They're a cankery\nindependent sort of chaps, are bootmakers. Now we'll go and see old\nPile. He'll have to second one of you,--will Pile. He's a sort of\nfather of the borough in the way of Conservatives. And look here, Sir\nThomas;--let him talk. Don't you say much to him. It's no use in life\ntalking to old Pile.\" Sir Thomas said nothing, but he determined that\nhe would speak to old Pile just as freely as he had to Mr. Trigger\nhimself.\n\n\"Eh;--ah;\"--said old Pile; \"you're Sir Thomas Underwood, are you? And\nyou wants to go into Parliament?\"\n\n\"If it please you and your townsmen to send me there.\"\n\n\"Yes;--that's just it. But if it don't please?\"\n\n\"Why, then I'll go home again.\"\n\n\"Just so;--but the people here ain't what they are at other places,\nSir Thomas Underwood. I've seen many elections here, Sir Thomas.\"\n\n\"No doubt you have, Mr. Pile.\"\n\n\"Over a dozen;--haven't you, Mr. Pile?\" said Trigger.\n\n\"And carried on a deal better than they have been since you meddled\nwith them,\" said Mr. Pile, turning upon Trigger. \"They used to do the\nthing here as it should be done, and nobody wasn't extortionate, nor\nyet cross-grained. They're changing a deal about these things, I'm\ntold; but they're changing all for the worse. They're talking of\npurity,--purity,--purity; and what does it all amount to? Men is\ngetting greedier every day.\"\n\n\"We mean to be pure at this election, Mr. Pile,\" said Sir Thomas. Mr.\nPile looked him hard in the face. \"At least I do, Mr. Pile. I can\nanswer for myself.\" Mr. Pile turned away his face, and opened his\nmouth, and put his hand upon his stomach, and made a grimace, as\nthough,--as though he were not quite as well as he might be. And such\nwas the case with him. The idea of purity of election at Percy-cross\ndid in truth make him feel very sick. It was an idea which he hated\nwith his whole heart. There was to him something absolutely mean and\nignoble in the idea of a man coming forward to represent a borough in\nParliament without paying the regular fees. That somebody, somewhere,\nshould make a noise about it,--somebody who was impalpable to him, in\nsome place that was to him quite another world,--was intelligible.\nIt might be all very well in Manchester and such-like disagreeable\nplaces. But that candidates should come down to Percycross and talk\nabout purity there, was a thing abominable to him. He had nothing to\nget by bribery. To a certain extent he was willing to pay money in\nbribery himself. But that a stranger should come to the borough and\nwant the seat without paying for it was to him so distasteful, that\nthis assurance from the mouth of one of the candidates did make him\nvery sick.\n\n\"I think you'd better go back to London, Sir Thomas,\" said Mr. Pile,\nas soon as he recovered himself sufficiently to express his opinion.\n\n\"You mean that my ideas as to standing won't suit the borough.\"\n\n\"No, they won't, Sir Thomas. I don't suppose anybody else will tell\nyou so,--but I'll do it. Why should, a poor man lose his day's wages\nfor the sake of making you a Parliament man? What have you done for\nany of 'em?\"\n\n\"Half an hour would take a working man to the poll and back,\" argued\nSir Thomas.\n\n\"That's all you know about elections. That's not the way we manage\nmatters here. There won't be any place of business agait that day.\"\nThen Mr. Trigger whispered a few words to Mr. Pile. Mr. Pile repeated\nthe grimace which he had made before, and turned on his heel although\nhe was in his own parlour, as though he were going to leave them.\nBut he thought better of this, and turned again. \"I always vote Blue\nmyself,\" said Mr. Pile, \"and I don't suppose I shall do otherwise\nthis time. But I shan't take no trouble. There's a many things that I\ndon't like, Sir Thomas. Good morning, Sir Thomas. It's all very well\nfor Mr. Trigger. He knows where the butter lies for his bread.\"\n\n\"A very disagreeable old man,\" said Sir Thomas, when they had left\nthe house, thinking that as Mr. Trigger had been grossly insulted by\nthe bootmaker he would probably coincide in this opinion.\n\nBut Mr. Trigger knew his townsman well, and was used to him. \"He's\nbetter than some of 'em, Sir Thomas. He'll do as much as he says, and\nmore. Now there was that chap Spicer at the mustard works. They say\nWestmacott people are after him, and if they can make it worth his\nwhile he'll go over. There's some talk about Apothecary's Hall;--I\ndon't know what it is. But you couldn't buy old Pile if you were to\ngive him the Queen and all the Royal family to make boots for.\"\n\nThis was to have been the last of Sir Thomas's preliminary visits\namong the leading Conservatives of the borough, but as they were\ngoing back to the \"Percy Standard,\"--for such was the name of the\nBlue inn in the borough,--Mr. Trigger saw a gentleman in black\nstanding at an open hall door, and immediately proposed that they\nshould just say a word or two to Mr. Pabsby. \"Wesleyan minister,\"\nwhispered the Percycross bear-leader into the ear of his bear;--\"and\nhas a deal to say to many of the men, and more to the women. Can't\nsay what he'll do;--split his vote, probably.\" Then he introduced\nthe two men, explaining the cause of Sir Thomas's presence in the\nborough. Mr. Pabsby was delighted to make the acquaintance of Sir\nThomas, and asked the two gentlemen into the house. In truth he was\ndelighted. The hours often ran heavily with him, and here there was\nsomething for him to do. \"You'll give us a help, Mr. Pabsby?\" said\nMr. Trigger. Mr. Pabsby smiled and rubbed his hands, and paused and\nlaid his head on one side.\n\n\"I hope he will,\" said Sir Thomas, \"if he is of our way cf thinking,\notherwise I should be sorry to ask him.\" Still Mr. Pabsby said\nnothing;--but he smiled very sweetly, and laid his head a little\nlower.\n\n\n[Illustration: Still Mr. Pabsby said nothing;--but he smiled\nvery sweetly, and laid his head a little lower.]\n\n\n\"He knows we're on the respectable side,\" said Mr. Trigger. \"The\nWesleyans now are most as one as the Church of England,--in the way\nof not being roughs and rowdies.\" Sir Thomas, who did not know Mr.\nPabsby, was afraid that he would be offended at this; but he showed\nno sign of offence as he continued to rub his hands. Mr. Pabsby was\nmeditating his speech.\n\n\"We're a little hurried, Mr. Pabsby,\" said Mr. Trigger; \"perhaps\nyou'll think of it.\"\n\nBut Mr. Pabsby was not going to let them escape in that way. It\nwas not every day that he had a Sir Thomas, or a candidate for the\nborough, or even a Mr. Trigger, in that little parlour. The fact was\nthat Mr. Trigger, who generally knew what he was about, had made a\nmistake. Sir Thomas, who was ready enough to depart, saw that an\nimmediate escape was impossible. \"Sir Thomas,\" began Mr. Pabsby, in\na soft, greasy voice,--a voice made up of pretence, politeness and\nsaliva,--\"if you will give me three minutes to express myself on this\nsubject I shall be obliged to you.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Sir Thomas, sitting bolt upright in his chair, and\nholding his hat as though he were determined to go directly the three\nminutes were over.\n\n\"A minister of the Gospel in this town is placed in a peculiar\nposition, Sir Thomas,\" said Mr. Pabsby very slowly, \"and of all\nthe ministers of religion in Percycross mine is the most peculiar.\nIn this matter I would wish to be guided wholly by duty, and if I\ncould see my way clearly I would at once declare it to you. But, Sir\nThomas, I owe much to the convictions of my people.\"\n\n\"Which way do you mean to vote?\" asked Mr. Trigger.\n\nMr. Pabsby did not even turn his face at this interruption. \"A\nprivate man, Sir Thomas, may follow the dictates of--of--of his own\nheart, perhaps.\" Here he paused, expecting to be encouraged by some\nwords. But Sir Thomas had acquired professionally a knowledge that\nto such a speaker as Mr. Pabsby any rejoinder or argument was like\nwinding up a clock. It is better to allow such clocks to run down.\n\"With me, I have to consider every possible point. What will my\npeople wish? Some of them are eager in the cause of reform, Sir\nThomas; and some others--\"\n\n\"We shall lose the train,\" said Mr. Trigger, jumping up and putting\non his hat.\n\n\"I'm afraid we shall,\" said Sir Thomas rising, but not putting on\nhis.\n\n\"Half a minute,\" said Mr. Pabsby pleading, but not rising from his\nchair. \"Perhaps you will do me the honour of calling on me when you\nare again here in Percycross. I shall have the greatest pleasure in\ndiscussing a few matters with you, Sir Thomas; and then, if I can\ngive you my poor help, it will give me and Mrs. Pabsby the most\nsincere pleasure.\" Mrs. Pabsby had now entered the room, and was\nintroduced; but Trigger would not sit down again, nor take off his\nhat. He boldly marshalled the way to the door, while Sir Thomas\nfollowed, subject as he came to the eloquence of Mr. Pabsby. \"If I\ncan only see my way clearly, Sir Thomas,\" were the last words which\nMr. Pabsby spoke.\n\n\"He'll give one to Griffenbottom, certainly,\" said Mr. Trigger.\n\"Westmacott 'll probably have the other. I thought perhaps your title\nmight have gone down with him, but it didn't seem to take.\"\n\nAll this was anything but promising, anything but comfortable; and\nyet before he went to bed that night Sir Thomas had undertaken to\nstand. In such circumstances it is very hard for a man to refuse. He\nfeels that a certain amount of trouble has been taken on his behalf,\nthat retreat will be cowardly, and that the journey for nothing will\nbe personally disagreeable to his own feelings. And then, too, there\nwas that renewed ambition in his breast,--an ambition which six\nmonths ago he would have declared to be at rest for ever,--but\nwhich prompted him, now as strongly as ever, to go forward and do\nsomething. It is so easy to go and see;--so hard to retreat when one\nhas seen. He had not found Percycross to be especially congenial\nto him. He had felt himself to be out of his element there,--among\npeople with whom he had no sympathies; and he felt also that he had\nbeen unfitted for this kind of thing by the life which he had led for\nthe last few years. Still he undertook to stand.\n\n\"Who is coming forward on the other side?\" he asked Mr. Trigger late\nat night, when this matter had been decided in regard to himself.\n\n\"Westmacott, of course,\" said Trigger, \"and I'm told that the real\nRads of the place have got hold of a fellow named Moggs.\"\n\n\"Moggs!\" ejaculated Sir Thomas.\n\n\"Yes;--Moggs. The Young Men's Reform Association is bringing him\nforward. He's a Trades' Union man, and a Reform Leaguer, and all that\nkind of thing. I shouldn't be surprised if he got in. They say he's\ngot money.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI.\n\nTHE LIBERALS OF PERCYCROSS.\n\n\nYes;--Ontario Moggs was appalled, delighted, exalted, and nearly\nfrightened out of his wits by an invitation, conveyed to him by\ncertain eager spirits of the town, to come down and stand on the real\nradical interest for the borough of Percycross. The thing was not\nsuggested to him till a day or two after Sir Thomas had been sounded,\nand he was then informed that not an hour was to be lost. The\ncommunication was made in the little back parlour of the Cheshire\nCheese, and Moggs was expected to give an answer then and there. He\nstood with his hand on his brow for five minutes, and then asked that\nspecial question which should always come first on such occasions.\nWould it cost any money? Well;--yes. The eager spirits of Percycross\nthought that it would cost something. They were forced to admit that\nPercycross was not one of those well-arranged boroughs in which the\nexpenses of an election are all defrayed by the public spirit of the\ncitizens. It soon became clear that the deputation had waited upon\nMoggs, not only because Moggs was a good Radical, but because also\nMoggs was supposed to be a Radical with a command of money. Ontario\nfrowned and expressed an opinion that all elections should be made\nabsolutely free to the candidates. \"And everybody ought to go to\n'eaven, Mr. Moggs,\" said the leading member of the deputation, \"but\neverybody don't, 'cause things ain't as they ought to be.\" There was\nno answer to be made to this. Ontario could only strike his forehead\nand think. It was clear to him that he could not give an affirmative\nanswer that night, and he therefore, with some difficulty, arranged\nan adjournment of the meeting till the following afternoon at 2 P.M.\n\"We must go down by the 4.45 express to-morrow,\" said the leading\nmember of the deputation, who even by that arrangement would subject\nhimself to the loss of two days' wages,--for he was a foreman in the\nestablishment of Mr. Spicer the mustard-maker,--and whose allowance\nfor expenses would not admit of his sleeping away from home a second\nnight. Ontario departed, promising to be ready with his answer by 2\nP.M. on the following day.\n\nHow bright with jewels was the crown now held before his eyes, and\nyet how unapproachable, how far beyond his grasp! To be a member of\nParliament, to speak in that august assembly instead of wasting his\neloquence on the beery souls of those who frequented the Cheshire\nCheese, to be somebody in the land at his early age,--something so\ninfinitely superior to a maker of boots! A member of Parliament was\nby law an esquire, and therefore a gentleman. Ralph Newton was not\na member of Parliament;--not half so great a fellow as a member of\nParliament. Surely if he were to go to Polly Neefit as a member of\nParliament Polly would reject him no longer! And to what might it not\nlead? He had visions before his eyes of very beautiful moments in\nhis future life, in which, standing, as it were, on some well-chosen\nrostrum in that great House, he would make the burning thoughts of\nhis mind, the soaring aspirations of his heart, audible to all the\npeople. How had Cobden begun his career,--and Bright? Had it not\nbeen in this way? Why should not he be as great,--greater than\neither;--greater, because in these coming days a man of the people\nwould be able to wield a power more extensive than the people had\nearned for themselves in former days? And then, as he walked alone\nthrough the streets, he took to making speeches,--some such speeches\nas he would make when he stood up in his place in the House of\nCommons as the member for Percycross. The honourable member for\nPercycross! There was something ravishing in the sound. Would not\nthat sound be pleasant to the ears of Polly Neefit?\n\nBut then, was not the thing as distant as it was glorious? How could\nhe be member for Percycross, seeing that in all matters he was\nsubject to his father? His father hated the very name of the Cheshire\nCheese, and was, in every turn and feeling of his life, diametrically\nopposed to his son's sentiments. He would, nevertheless, go to his\nfather and demand assistance. If on such an occasion as this his\nfather should give him a stone when he asked for bread, he and his\nfather must be two! \"If, when such a prospect as this is held out to\nhis son, he cannot see it,\" said Ontario, \"then he can see nothing!\"\nBut yet he was sure that his father wouldn't see it.\n\nTo his extreme astonishment Mr. Moggs senior did see it. It was some\ntime before Mr. Moggs senior clearly understood the proposition which\nwas made to him, but when he did he became alive to the honour,--and\nperhaps profit,--of having a member of his firm in Parliament. Of\npolitics in the abstract Mr. Moggs senior knew very little. Nor,\nindeed, did he care much. In matters referring to trade he was a\nConservative, because he was a master. He liked to be able to manage\nhis people, and to pay 5_s._ 3_d._ instead of 5_s._ 8_d._ for the\nmaking of a pair of boots. He hated the Cheshire Cheese because his\nson went there, and because his son entertained strange and injurious\nideas which were propagated at that low place. But if the Cheshire\nCheese would send his son to Parliament, Mr. Moggs did not know\nbut what the Cheshire Cheese might be very well. At any rate, he\nundertook to pay the bills, if Ontario, his son, were brought forward\nas a candidate for the borough. He lost his head so completely in the\nglory of the thing, that it never occurred to him to ask what might\nbe the probable amount of the expenditure. \"There ain't no father in\nall London as 'd do more for his son than I would, if only I see'd\nthere was something in it,\" said Moggs senior, with a tear in his\neye. Moggs junior was profuse in gratitude, profuse in obedience,\nprofuse in love. Oh, heavens, what a golden crown was there now\nwithin his grasp!\n\nAll this occurred between the father and son early in the morning at\nShepherd's Bush, whither the son had gone out to the father after a\nnight of feverish longing and ambition. They went into town together,\non the top of the omnibus, and Ontario felt that he was being\ncarried heavenwards. What a heaven had he before him, even in that\nfortnight's canvass which it would be his glory to undertake! What\ntruths he would tell to the people, how he would lead them with him\nby political revelations that should be almost divine, how he would\nextract from them bursts of rapturous applause! To explain to them\nthat labour is the salt of the earth;--that would be his mission.\nAnd then, how sweet to teach them the value, the inestimable value,\nof the political privilege lately accorded to them,--or, as Ontario\nwould put it, lately wrested on their behalf from the hands of an\naristocracy which was more timid even than it was selfish;--how sweet\nto explain this, and then to instruct them, afterwards, that it was\ntheir duty now, having got this great boon for themselves, to see\nat once that it should be extended to those below them. \"Let the\nfirst work of household suffrage be a demand for manhood suffrage.\"\nThis had been enunciated by Ontario Moggs with great effect at the\nCheshire Cheese;--and now, as the result of such enunciation, he was\ngoing down to Percycross to stand as a candidate for the borough! He\nwas almost drunk with delight as he sat upon the knife-board of the\nShepherd's Bush omnibus, thinking of it all.\n\nHe, too, went down to Percycross, making a preliminary journey,--as\nhad done Sir Thomas Underwood,--timing his arrival there a day or\ntwo after the departure of the lawyer. Alas, he, also, met much to\ndisappoint him even at that early period of the contest. The people\nwhom he was taken to see were not millionaires and tradesmen in\na large way of business, but leading young men of warm political\ntemperaments. This man was president of a mechanics' institute, that\nsecretary to an amalgamation of unions for general improvement, and\na third chairman of the Young Men's Reform Association. They were\ndelighted to see him, and were very civil; but he soon found that\nthey were much more anxious to teach him than they were to receive\nhis political lessons. When he began, as unfortunately he did very\nearly in his dealings with them, to open out his own views, he soon\nfound that they had views also to open out. He was to represent\nthem,--that is to say, become the mouthpiece of their ideas. He had\nbeen selected because he was supposed to have some command of money.\nOf course he would have to address the people in the Mechanics' Hall;\nbut the chairman of the Young Men's Reform Association was very\nanxious to tell him what to say on that occasion. \"I am accustomed to\naddressing people,\" said Ontario Moggs, with a considerable accession\nof dignity.\n\nHe had the satisfaction of addressing the people, and the people\nreceived him kindly. But he thought he observed that the applause was\ngreater when the secretary of the Amalgamation-of-Improvement-Unions\nspoke, and he was sure that the enthusiasm for the Young Men's\nchairman mounted much higher than had done any ardour on his own\nbehalf. And he was astonished to find that these young men were just\nas fluent as himself. He did think, indeed, that they did not go\nquite so deep into the matter as he did, that they had not thought\nout great questions so thoroughly, but they had a way of saying\nthings which,--which would have told even at the Cheshire Cheese. The\nresult of all this was, that at the end of three days,--though he\nwas, no doubt, candidate for the borough of Percycross, and in that\ncapacity a great man in Percycross,--he did not seem to himself to\nbe so great as he had been when he made the journey down from London.\nThere was a certain feeling that he was a cat's-paw, brought there\nfor certain objects which were not his objects,--because they wanted\nmoney, and some one who would be fool enough to fight a losing\nbattle! He did not reap all that meed of personal admiration for his\neloquence which he expected.\n\nAnd, then, during these three days there arose another question, the\ndiscussion of which embarrassed him not a little. Mr. Westmacott was\nin the town, and there was a question whether he and Mr. Westmacott\nwere to join forces. It was understood that Mr. Westmacott and Mr.\nWestmacott's leading friends objected to this; but the chairmen of\nthe young men, and the presidents and the secretaries on the Radical\nside put their heads together, and declared that if Mr. Westmacott\nwere proud they would run their horse alone;--they would vote for\nMoggs, and for Moggs only. Or else,--as it was whispered,--they would\ncome to terms with Griffenbottom, and see that Sir Thomas was sent\nback to London. The chairmen, and the presidents, and the secretaries\nwere powerful enough to get the better of Mr. Westmacott, and large\nplacards were printed setting forward the joint names of Westmacott\nand Moggs. The two liberal candidates were to employ the same agent,\nand were to canvass together. This was all very well,--was the very\nthing which Moggs should have desired. But it was all arranged\nwithout any consultation with him, and he felt that the objection\nwhich had been raised was personal to himself. Worse than all, when\nhe was brought face to face with Mr. Westmacott he had not a word\nto say for himself! He tried it and failed. Mr. Westmacott had been\na member of Parliament, and was a gentleman. Ontario, for aught he\nhimself knew, might have called upon Mr. Westmacott for the amount\nof Mr. Westmacott's little bill. He caught himself calling Mr.\nWestmacott, sir, and almost wished that he could bite out his own\ntongue. He felt that he was a nobody in the interview, and that the\nchairmen, the secretaries, and the presidents were regretting their\nbargain, and saying among themselves that they had done very badly in\nbringing down Ontario Moggs as a candidate for their borough. There\nwere moments before he left Percycross in which he was almost tempted\nto resign.\n\nBut he left the town the accepted candidate of his special friends,\nand was assured, with many parting grasps of the hand on the\nplatform, that he would certainly be brought in at the top of the\npoll. Another little incident should be mentioned. He had been asked\nby the electioneering agent for a small trifle of some hundred pounds\ntowards the expenses, and this, by the generosity of his father, he\nhad been able to give. \"We shall get along now like a house on fire,\"\nsaid the agent, as he pocketed the cheque. Up to that moment there\nmay have been doubts upon the agent's mind.\n\nAs he went back to London he acknowledged to himself that he had\nfailed hitherto,--he had failed in making that impression at\nPercycross which would have been becoming to him as the future member\nof Parliament for the borough; but he gallantly resolved that he\nwould do better in the future. He would speak in such a way that the\nmen of Percycross should listen to him and admire. He would make\noccasion for himself. He thought that he could do better than Mr.\nWestmacott,--put more stuff in what he had got to say. And, whatever\nmight happen to him, he would hold up his head. Why should he not be\nas good a man as Westmacott? It was the man that was needed,--not\nthe outside trappings. Then he asked himself a question whether, as\ntrappings themselves were so trivial, a man was necessarily mean who\ndealt in trappings. He did not remember to have heard of a bootmaker\nin Parliament. But there should be a bootmaker in Parliament\nsoon;--and thus he plucked up his courage.\n\nOn his journey down to Percycross he had thought that immediately on\nhis return to London he would go across to Hendon, and take advantage\nof his standing as a candidate for the borough; but as he returned he\nresolved that he would wait till the election was over. He would go\nto Polly with all his honours on his head.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII.\n\nRALPH NEWTON'S DECISION.\n\n\nOntario Moggs was at Percycross when Ralph Newton was making his\nformal offer to Polly Neefit. Ralph when he had made his offer\nreturned to London with mixed feelings. He had certainly been\noppressed at times by the conviction that he must make the offer even\nthough it went against the grain with him to do so;--and at these\nmoments he had not failed to remind himself that he was about to make\nhimself miserable for life because he had been weak enough to take\npecuniary assistance in the hour of his temporary necessities from\nthe hands of Polly's father. Now he had made his offer; it had not\nbeen accepted, and he was still free. He could see his way out of\nthat dilemma without dishonour. But then that dilemma became very\nmuch smaller to his sight when it was surmounted,--as is the nature\nwith all dilemmas; and the other dilemma, which would have been\nremedied had Polly accepted him, again loomed very large. And as he\nlooked back at the matrimonial dilemma which he had escaped, and\nat Polly standing before him, comely, healthy, and honest, such a\npleasant armful, and so womanly withal,--so pleasant a girl if only\nshe was not to be judged and sentenced by others beside himself,--he\nalmost thought that that dilemma was one which he could have borne\nwithout complaint. But Polly's suggestion that they should allow a\nyear to run round in order that they might learn to know each other\nwas one which he could not entertain. He had but three days in which\nto give an answer to his uncle, and up to this time two alternatives\nhad been open to him,--the sale of his reversion and independence, or\nPolly and the future lordship of Newton. He had thought that there\nwas nothing but to choose. It had not occurred to him that Polly\nwould raise any objection. He had felt neither fear nor hope in that\ndirection. It followed as a consequence now that the lordship must\ngo. He would not, however, make up his mind that it should go till\nthe last moment.\n\nOn the following morning he was thinking that he might as well go to\nthe shop in Conduit Street, feeling that he could encounter Neefit\nwithout any qualms of conscience, when Mr. Neefit came to him. This\nwas certainly a better arrangement. It was easier to talk of his\nown affairs sitting at ease in his own arm-chair, than to carry on\nthe discussion among the various sporting garments which adorned Mr.\nNeefit's little back room, subject to interruption from customers,\nand possibly within the hearing of Mr. Waddle and Herr Bawwah.\nNeefit, seated at the end of the sofa in Ralph's comfortable room,\nlooking out of his saucer eyes with all his energy, was in a certain\ndegree degrading,--but was not quite so degrading as Neefit at his\nown barn-door in Conduit Street. \"I was just coming to you,\" he said,\nas he made the breeches-maker welcome.\n\n\"Well;--yes; but I thought I'd catch you here, Captain. Them men\nof mine has such long ears! That German who lets on that he don't\nunderstand only just a word or two of English, hears everything\nthrough a twelve-inch brick wall. Polly told me as you'd been with\nher.\"\n\n\"I suppose so, Mr. Neefit.\"\n\n\"Oh, she ain't one as 'd keep anything from me. She's open and\nstraightforward, anyways.\"\n\n\"So I found her.\"\n\n\"Now look here, Captain. I've just one word to say about her.\nStick to her.\" Ralph was well aware that he must explain the exact\ncircumstances in which he stood to the man who was to have been his\nfather-in-law, but hardly knew how to begin his explanation. \"She\nain't nowise again you,\" continued Mr. Neefit. \"She owned as much\nwhen I put her through her facings. I did put her through her facings\npretty tightly. 'What is it that you want, Miss?' said I. 'D' you\nwant to have a husband, or d' you want to be an old maid?' They don't\nlike that word old maid;--not as used again themselves, don't any\nyoung woman.\"\n\n\"Polly will never be an old maid,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"She owned as she didn't want that. 'I suppose I'll have to take some\nof 'em some day,' she said. Lord, how pretty she did look as she said\nit;--just laughing and crying, smiling and pouting all at once. She\nain't a bad 'un to look at, Captain?\"\n\n\"Indeed she is not.\"\n\n\"Nor yet to go. Do you stick to her. Them's my words. 'D' you want\nto have that ugly bootmaker?' said I. 'He ain't ugly,' said she. 'D'\nyou want to have him, Miss?' said I. 'No, I don't,' said she. 'Well!'\nsaid I. 'But I do know him,' said Polly, 'and I don't know Mr. Newton\nno more than Adam!' Them were her very words, Captain. Do you stick\nto her, Captain. I'll tell you what. Let's all go down to Margate\ntogether for a week.\" That was Mr. Neefit's plan of action.\n\nThen Ralph got up from his easy-chair and began his explanation. He\ncouldn't very well go down to Margate, delightful as it would be to\nsit upon the sands with Polly. He was so situated that he must at\nonce decide as to the sale of his property at Newton. Mr. Neefit put\nhis hands in his pockets, and sat perfectly silent, listening to his\nyoung friend's explanation. If Polly would have accepted him at once,\nRalph went on to explain, everything would have been straight; but,\nas she would not do so, he must take his uncle's offer. He had no\nother means of extricating himself from his embarrassments. \"Why, Mr.\nNeefit, I could not look you in the face unless I were prepared to\npay you your money,\" he said.\n\n\"Drat that,\" replied Neefit, and then again he listened.\n\nRalph went on. He could not go on long in his present condition. His\nbill for \u00c2\u00a3500 to Mr. Horsball of the Moonbeam was coming round. He\nliterally had not \u00c2\u00a320 in his possession to carry on the war. His\nuncle's offer would be withdrawn if it were not accepted the day\nafter to-morrow. Nobody else would give half so much. The thing must\nbe done, and then;--why, then he would have nothing to offer to Polly\nworthy of her acceptance. \"Bother,\" said Mr. Neefit, who had not once\ntaken his eyes off Ralph's face. Ralph said that that might be all\nvery well, but such were the facts. \"You ain't that soft that you're\ngoing to let 'em rob you of the estate?\" said the breeches-maker in\na tone of horror. Ralph raised his hands and his eyebrows together.\nYes;--that was what he intended to do.\n\n\"There shan't be nothing of the kind,\" said the breeches-maker.\n\"What! \u00c2\u00a37,000 a year, ain't it? All in land, ain't it? And it must\nbe your own, let 'em do what they will; mustn't it?\" He paused a\nmoment, and Ralph nodded his head. \"What you have to do is to get a\nwife,--and a son before any of 'em can say Jack Robinson. Lord bless\nyou! Just spit at 'em if they talks of buying it. S'pose the old gent\nwas to go off all along of apperplexy the next day, how'd you feel\nthen? Like cutting your throat;--wouldn't you, Captain?\"\n\n\"But my uncle's life is very good.\"\n\n\"He ain't got no receipt against kingdom come, I dare say.\" Ralph was\nsurprised by his tradesman's eloquence and wit. \"You have a chick of\nyour own, and then you'll know as it'll be yours some way or other.\nIf I'd the chance I'd sooner beg, borrow, starve, or die, before I'd\nsell it;--let alone working, Captain.\" There was satire too as well\nas eloquence in the breeches-maker. \"No;--you must run your chance,\nsomehow.\"\n\n\"I don't see my way,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"You have got something, Captain;--something of your own?\"\n\n\"Well;--just enough to pay my debts, if all were sold, and buy myself\na rope to hang myself.\"\n\n\"I'll pay your debts, Captain.\"\n\n\"I couldn't hear of it, Mr. Neefit.\"\n\n\"As for not hearing of it,--that's bother. You do hear of it now. And\nhow much more do you want to keep you? You shall have what you want.\nYou meant honest along of Polly yesterday, and you mean honest now.\"\nRalph winced, but he did not deny what Neefit said, nor aught that\nwas implied in the saying. \"We'll bring you and Polly together, and I\ntell you she'll come round.\" Ralph shook his head. \"Anyways you shall\nhave the money;--there now. We'll have a bit of a paper, and if this\nmarriage don't come off there'll be the money to come back, and five\nper cent. when the old gent dies.\"\n\n\"But I might die first.\"\n\n\"We'll insure your life, Captain. Only we must be upon the square.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"I'd rather a'most lose it all than think such a chance should be\nmissed. \u00c2\u00a37,000 a year, and all in land? When one knows how hard it is\nto get, to think of selling it!\"\n\nRalph made no positive promise, but when Mr. Neefit left him, there\nwas,--so at least thought Mr. Neefit,--an implied understanding that\n\"the Captain\" would at once put an end to this transaction between\nhim and his uncle. And yet Ralph didn't feel quite certain. The\nbreeches-maker had been generous,--very generous, and very trusting;\nbut he hated the man's generosity and confidence. The breeches-maker\nhad got such a hold of him that he seemed to have lost all power of\nthinking and acting for himself. And then such a man as he was, with\nhis staring round eyes, and heavy face, and dirty hands, and ugly\nbald head! There is a baldness that is handsome and noble, and a\nbaldness that is peculiarly mean and despicable. Neefit's baldness\nwas certainly of the latter order. Now Moggs senior, who was grey and\nnot bald, was not bad looking,--at a little distance. His face when\nclosely inspected was poor and greedy, but the general effect at a\npassing glance was not contemptible. Moggs might have been a banker,\nor an officer in the Commissariat, or a clerk in the Treasury. A\nson-in-law would have had hopes of Moggs. But nothing of the kind was\npossible with Neefit. One would be forced to explain that he was a\nrespectable tradesman in Conduit Street in order that he might not be\ntaken for a dealer in potatoes from Whitechapel. He was hopeless. And\nyet he had taken upon himself the absolute management of all Ralph\nNewton's affairs!\n\nRalph was very unhappy, and in his misery he went to Sir Thomas's\nchambers. This was about four o'clock in the day, at which hour Sir\nThomas was almost always in his rooms. But Stemm with much difficulty\nsucceeded in making him believe that the lawyer was not at home.\nStemm at this time was much disturbed by his master's terrible\nresolution to try the world again, to stand for a seat in Parliament,\nand to put himself once more in the way of work and possible\npromotion. Stemm had condemned the project,--but, nevertheless,\ntook glory in it. What if his master should become,--should\nbecome anything great and magnificent. Stemm had often groaned in\nsilence,--had groaned unconsciously, that his master should be\nnothing. He loved his master thoroughly,--loving no one else in\nthe whole world,--and sympathised with him acutely. Still he had\ncondemned the project. \"There's so many of them, Sir Thomas, as\nis only wanting to put their fingers into somebody's eyes.\" \"No\ndoubt, Stemm, no doubt,\" said Sir Thomas; \"and as well into mine as\nanother's.\" \"That's it, Sir Thomas.\" \"But I'll just run down and\nsee, Stemm.\" And so it had been settled. Stemm, who had always hated\nRalph Newton, and who now regarded his master's time as more precious\nthan ever, would hardly give any answer at all to Ralph's enquiries.\nHis master might be at home at Fulham,--probably was. Where should\na gentleman so likely be as at home,--that is, when he wasn't in\nchambers? \"Anyways, he's not here,\" said Stemm, bobbing his head, and\nholding the door ready to close it. Ralph was convinced, then dined\nat his club, and afterwards went down to Fulham. He had heard nothing\nfrom Stemm, or elsewhere, of the intended candidature.\n\nSir Thomas was not at Fulham, nor did the girls know aught of his\nwhereabouts. But the great story was soon told. Papa was going to\nstand for Percycross. \"We are so glad,\" said Mary Bonner, bursting\nout into enthusiasm. \"We walk about the garden making speeches to the\nelectors all day. Oh dear, I do wish we could do something.\"\n\n\"Glad is no word,\" said Clarissa. \"But if he loses it!\"\n\n\"The very trying for it is good,\" said Patience. \"It is just the\nproper thing for papa.\"\n\n\"I shall feel so proud when uncle is in Parliament again,\" said Mary\nBonner. \"A woman's pride is always vicarious;--but still it is\npride.\"\n\nRalph also was surprised,--so much surprised that for a few minutes\nhis own affairs were turned out of his head. He, too, had thought\nthat Sir Thomas would never again do anything in the world,--unless\nthat book should be written of which he had so often heard\nhints,--though never yet, with any accuracy, its name or subject. Sir\nThomas, he was told, had been at Percycross, but was not supposed\nto be there now. \"Of course he was in his chambers,\" said Clarissa.\n\"Old Stemm does know how to tell lies so well!\" It was, however,\nacknowledged that, having on his hands a piece of business so very\nweighty, Sir Thomas might be almost anywhere without any fault on his\npart. A gentleman in the throes of an election for Parliament could\nnot be expected to be at home. Even Patience did not feel called upon\nto regret his absence.\n\nBefore he went back to town Ralph found himself alone with Mary for\na few minutes. \"Mr. Newton,\" she said, \"why don't you stand for\nParliament?\"\n\n\"I have not the means.\"\n\n\"You have great prospects. I should have thought you were just\nthe man who ought to make it the work of your life to get into\nParliament.\" Ralph began to ask himself what had been the work of his\nlife. \"They say that to be of real use a man ought to begin young.\"\n\n\"Nobody ought to go into the House without money,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"That means, I suppose, that men shouldn't go in who want their time\nto earn their bread. But you haven't that to do. If I were a man such\nas you are I would always try to be something. I am sure Parliament\nwas meant for men having estates such as you will have.\"\n\n\"When I've got it, I'll think about Parliament, Miss Bonner.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it will be too late then. Don't you know that song of\n'Excelsior,' Mr. Newton? You ought to learn to sing it.\"\n\nYes;--he was learning to sing it after a fine fashion;--borrowing his\ntradesman's money, and promising to marry his tradesman's daughter!\nHe was half inclined to be angry with this interference from Mary\nBonner;--and yet he liked her for it. Could it be that she herself\nfelt an interest in what concerned him? \"Ah me,\"--he said to\nhimself,--\"how much better would it have been to have learned\nsomething, to have fitted myself for some high work; and to have been\nable to choose some such woman as this for my wife!\" And all that had\nbeen sacrificed to horses at the Moonbeam, and little dinners with\nCaptain Fooks and Lieutenant Cox! Every now and again during his life\nPhoebus had touched his trembling ears, and had given him to know\nthat to sport with the tangles of Na\u00c3\u00a6ra's hair was not satisfactory\nas the work of a man's life. But, alas, the god had intervened but\nto little purpose. The horses at the Moonbeam, which had been two,\nbecame four, and then six; and now he was pledged to marry Polly\nNeefit,--if only he could induce Polly Neefit to have him. It was too\nlate in the day for him to think now of Parliament and Mary Bonner.\n\nAnd then, before he left them, poor Clary whispered a word into\nhis ear,--a cousinly, brotherly word, such as their circumstances\nauthorised her to make. \"Is it settled about the property, Ralph?\"\nFor she, too, had heard that this question of a sale was going\nforward.\n\n\"Not quite, Clary.\"\n\n\"You won't sell it; will you?\"\n\n\"I don't think I shall.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't;--pray don't. Anything will be better than that. It is so\ngood to wait.\" She was thinking only of Ralph, and of his interests,\nbut she could not forget the lesson which she was daily teaching to\nherself.\n\n\"If I can help it, I shall not sell it.\"\n\n\"Papa will help you;--will he not? If I were you they should drag\nme in pieces before I would part with my birthright;--and such a\nbirthright!\" It had occurred to her once that Ralph might feel that,\nafter what had passed between them one night on the lawn, he was\nbound not to wait, that it was his duty so to settle his affairs that\nhe might at once go to her father and say,--\"Though I shall never be\nMr. Newton of Newton, I have still such and such means of supporting\nyour daughter.\" Ah! if he would only be open with her, and tell\nher everything, he would soon know how unnecessary it was to make\na sacrifice for her. He pressed her hand as he left her, and said\na word that was a word of comfort. \"Clary, I cannot speak with\ncertainty, but I do not think that it will be sold.\"\n\n\"I am so glad!\" she said. \"Oh, Ralph, never, never part with it.\" And\nthen she blushed, as she thought of what she had said. Could it be\nthat he would think that she was speaking for her own sake;--because\nshe looked forward to reigning some day as mistress of Newton Priory?\nAh, no, Ralph would never misinterpret her thoughts in a manner so\nunmanly as that!\n\nThe day came, and it was absolutely necessary that the answer should\nbe given. Neefit came to prompt him again, and seemed to sit on\nthe sofa with more feeling of being at home than he had displayed\nbefore. He brought his cheque-book with him, and laid it rather\nostentatiously upon the table. He had good news, too, from Polly. \"If\nMr. Newton would come down to Margate, she would be ever so glad.\"\nThat was the message as given by Mr. Neefit, but the reader will\nprobably doubt that it came exactly in those words from Polly's lips.\nRalph was angry, and shook his head in wrath. \"Well, Captain, how's\nit to be?\" asked Mr. Neefit.\n\n\"I shall let my uncle know that I intend to keep my property,\" said\nRalph, with as much dignity as he knew how to assume.\n\nThe breeches-maker jumped up and crowed,--actually crowed, as might\nhave crowed a cock. It was an art that he had learned in his youth.\n\"That's my lad of wax,\" he said, slapping Ralph on the shoulder. \"And\nnow tell us how much it's to be,\" said he, opening the cheque-book.\nBut Ralph declined to take money at the present moment, endeavouring\nto awe the breeches-maker back into sobriety by his manner. Neefit\ndid put up his cheque-book, but was not awed back into perfect\nsobriety. \"Come to me, when you want it, and you shall have\nit, Captain. Don't let that chap as 'as the 'orses be any way\ndisagreeable. You tell him he can have it all when he wants it. And\nhe can;--be blowed if he can't. We'll see it through, Captain. And\nnow, Captain, when'll you come out and see Polly?\" Ralph would give\nno definite answer to this,--on account of business, but was induced\nat last to send his love to Miss Neefit. \"That man will drive me into\na lunatic asylum at last,\" he said to himself, as he threw himself\ninto his arm-chair when Neefit had departed.\n\nNevertheless, he wrote his letter to his uncle's lawyer, Mr. Carey,\nas follows:--\n\n\n   ---- Club, 20 Sept., 186--.\n\n   DEAR SIR,--\n\n   After mature consideration I have resolved upon declining\n   the offer made to me by my uncle respecting the Newton\n   property.\n\n   Faithfully yours,\n\n   RALPH NEWTON.\n\n   Richard Carey, Esq.\n\n\nIt was very short, but it seemed to him to contain all that there\nwas to be said. He might, indeed, have expressed regret that so much\ntrouble had been occasioned;--but the trouble had been taken not for\nhis sake, and he was not bound to denude himself of his property\nbecause his uncle had taken trouble.\n\nWhen the letter was put into the Squire's hands in Mr. Carey's\nprivate room, the Squire was nearly mad with rage. In spite of all\nthat his son had told him, in disregard of all his own solicitor's\ncautions, in the teeth of his nephew Gregory's certainty, he had\nfelt sure that the thing would be done. The young man was penniless,\nand must sell; and he could sell nowhere else with circumstances so\nfavourable. And now the young man wrote a letter as though he were\ndeclining to deal about a horse! \"It's some sham, some falsehood,\"\nsaid the Squire. \"Some low attorney is putting him up to thinking\nthat he can get more out of me.\"\n\n\"It's possible,\" said Mr. Carey; \"but there's nothing more to be\ndone.\" The Squire when last in London had asserted most positively\nthat he would not increase his bid.\n\n\"But he's penniless,\" said the Squire.\n\n\"There are those about him that will put him in the way of raising\nmoney,\" said the lawyer.\n\n\"And so the property will go to the hammer,--and I can do nothing to\nhelp it!\" Mr. Carey did not tell his client that a gentleman had no\nright to complain because he could not deal with effects which were\nnot his own; but that was the line which his thoughts took. The\nSquire walked about the room, lashing himself in his rage. He could\nnot bear to be beaten. \"How much more would do it?\" he said at last.\nIt would be terribly bitter to him to be made to give way, to be\ndriven to increase the price; but even that would be less bitter than\nfailure.\n\n\"I should say nothing,--just at present, if I were you,\" said Mr.\nCarey. The Squire still walked about the room. \"If he raises money\non the estate we shall hear of it. And so much of his rights as pass\nfrom him we can purchase. It will be more prudent for us to wait.\"\n\n\"Would another \u00c2\u00a35,000 do it at once?\" said the Squire.\n\n\"At any rate I would not offer it,\" said Mr. Carey.\n\n\"Ah;--you don't understand. You don't feel what it is that I want.\nWhat would you say if a man told you to wait while your hand was in\nthe fire?\"\n\n\"But you are in possession, Mr. Newton.\"\n\n\"No;--I'm not. I'm not in possession. I'm only a lodger in the place.\nI can do nothing. I cannot even build a farm-house for a tenant.\"\n\n\"Surely you can, Mr. Gregory.\"\n\n\"What;--for him! You think that would be one of the delights of\npossession? Put my money into the ground like seed, in order that the\nfruit may be gathered by him! I'm not a good enough Christian, Mr.\nCarey, to take much delight in that. I'll tell you what it is, Mr.\nCarey. The place is a hell upon earth to me, till I can call it my\nown.\" At last he left his lawyer, and went back to Newton Priory,\nhaving given instructions that the transaction should be re-opened\nbetween the two lawyers, and that additional money, to the extent of\n\u00c2\u00a35,000, should by degrees be offered.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII.\n\n\"I'LL BE A HYPOCRITE IF YOU CHOOSE.\"\n\n\nThere could hardly be a more unhappy man than was the Squire on his\njourney home. He had buoyed himself up with hope till he had felt\ncertain that he would return to Newton Priory its real and permanent\nowner, no longer a lodger in the place, as he had called himself to\nthe lawyer, but able to look upon every tree as his own, with power\nto cut down every oak upon the property; though, as he knew very\nwell, he would rather spill blood from his veins than cut down one of\nthem. But in that case he would preserve the oaks,--preserve them by\nhis own decision,--because they were his own, and because he could\ngive them to his own son. His son should cut them down if he pleased.\nAnd then the power of putting up would be quite as sweet to him as\nthe power of pulling down. What pleasure would he have in making\nevery deficient house upon the estate efficient, when he knew that\nthe stones as he laid them would not become the property of his\nenemy. He was a man who had never spent his full income. The property\nhad been in his hands now for some fifteen years, and he had already\namassed a considerable sum of money,--a sum which would have\nenabled him to buy out his nephew altogether, without selling an\nacre,--presuming the price already fixed to have been sufficient. He\nhad determined to sell something, knowing that he could not do as he\nwould do with the remainder if his hands were empty. He had settled\nit all in his mind;--how Ralph, his Ralph, must marry, and have a\nseparate income. There would be no doubt about his Ralph's marriage\nwhen once it should be known that his Ralph was the heir to Newton.\nThe bar sinister would matter but little then;--would be clean\nforgotten. His mind had been full of all this as he had come up\nto London. It had all been settled. He had decided upon ignoring\naltogether those cautions which his son and nephew and lawyer had\ncroaked into his ears. This legitimate heir was a ruined spendthrift,\nwho had no alternative but to raise money, no ambition but to spend\nmoney, no pursuit but to waste money. His temperament was so sanguine\nthat when he entered Mr. Carey's office he had hardly doubted. Now\neverything had been upset, and he was cast down from triumph into an\nabyss of despondency by two lines from this wretched, meaningless,\npoor-spirited spendthrift! \"I believe he'd take a pleasure in seeing\nthe property going to the dogs, merely to spite me,\" said the Squire\nto his son, as soon as he reached home,--having probably forgotten\nhis former idea, that his nephew was determined, with the pertinacity\nof a patient, far-sighted Jew money-lender, to wring from him the\nlast possible shilling.\n\nRalph, who was not the heir, was of his nature so just, that he could\nnot hear an accusation which he did not believe to be true, without\nprotesting against it. The Squire had called the heir a spiritless\nspendthrift, and a malicious evil-doer, intent upon ruining the\nestate, and a grasping Jew, all in the same breath.\n\n\"I think you are hard upon him, sir,\" said the son to the father.\n\n\"Of course you think so. At any rate you'll say so,\" said the Squire.\n\"One would suppose I was thinking only of myself to hear you talk.\"\n\n\"I know what you're thinking of,\" said Ralph slowly; \"and I know how\nmuch I owe you.\"\n\n\"I sometimes think that you ought to curse me,\" said the Squire.\n\nAfter this, at this moment, with such words ringing in his ears,\nRalph found it to be impossible to expostulate with his father. He\ncould only take his father's arm, and whisper a soft feminine word or\ntwo. He would be as happy as the day was long, if only he could see\nhis father happy.\n\n\"I can never be happy till I have placed you where you would have\nbeen,\" said the Squire. \"The gods are just, and our pleasant vices\nmake instruments to scourge us.\" He did not quote the line to\nhimself, but the purport of it hung heavy on him. And yet he thought\nit hard that because he had money in his pocket he could not\naltogether make himself free of the scourge.\n\nOn the following morning he was less vituperative and less\nunreasonable, but he was still intent upon the subject. After\nbreakfast he got his son into his own room,--the room in which he did\nhis magistrate's work, and added up his accounts, and kept his spuds\nand spurs,--and seriously discussed the whole matter. What would it\nbe wise that they should do next? \"You don't mean to tell me that you\ndon't wish me to buy it?\" said the Squire. No; Ralph would not say\nthat. If it were in the market, to be bought, and if the money were\nforthcoming, of course such a purchase would be expedient. \"The money\nis forthcoming,\" said the Squire. \"We can make it up one way or\nanother. What matter if we did sell Brownriggs? What matter if we\nsold Brownriggs and Twining as well?\" Ralph quite acceded to this.\nAs far as buying and selling were concerned he would have acceded\nto anything that would have made his father happy. \"I won't say a\nword against this fellow, since you are so fond of him,\" continued\nthe Squire. Ralph, though his father paused, made no reply to the\nintended sarcasm. \"But you must allow that he had a reason for\nwriting such a letter as he did.\"\n\n\"Of course he had a reason,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"Well;--we'll say that he wants to keep it.\"\n\n\"That's not unnatural.\"\n\n\"Not at all. Everybody likes to keep what he's got, and to get as\nmuch as he can. That's nature. But a man can't eat his cake and have\nit. He has been slow to learn that, no doubt; but I suppose he has\nlearned it. He wouldn't have gone to Sir Thomas Underwood, in the\nway he did, crying to be helped,--if he hadn't learned it. Remember,\nRalph, I didn't go to him first;--he came to me. You always forget\nthat. What was the meaning then of Sir Thomas writing to me in that\npitiful way,--asking me to do something for him;--and he who had I\ndon't know how much, something like \u00c2\u00a3800 a year, I take it, the day\nhe came of age?\"\n\n\"Of course he has been imprudent.\"\n\n\"He cannot eat his cake and have it. He wants to eat it, and I want\nto have it. I am sure it may be managed. I suppose you mean to go up\nand see him.\"\n\n\"See Ralph?\"\n\n\"Why not? You are not afraid of him.\" The son smiled, but made\nno answer. \"You might find out from him what it is he really\nwants;--what he will really do. Those attorneys don't understand.\nCarey isn't a bad fellow, and as for honesty, I'd trust him with\nanything. I've known him and his father all my life, and in any\nordinary piece of business there is no one whose opinion I would take\nso soon. But he talks of my waiting, telling me that the thing will\ncome round after a few years,--as if what one wanted was merely an\ninvestment for one's money. It isn't that.\"\n\n\"No, sir;--it isn't that.\"\n\n\"Not that at all. It's the feeling of the thing. Your lawyer may be\nthe best man in the world to lay out your money in a speculation, but\nhe doesn't dare to buy contentment for you. He doesn't see it, and\none hardly dares to try and make him see it. I'd give the half of\nit all to have the other half, but I cannot tell him that. I'd give\none half so long as that fellow wasn't to be the owner of the other.\nWe'll have no opposition Newton in the place.\"\n\nThe Squire's son was of course willing enough to go up to London.\nHe would see the heir at any rate, and endeavour to learn what were\nthe wishes of the heir. \"You may say what money you like,\" said the\nSquire. \"I hardly care what I pay, so long as it is possible to pay\nit. Go up to \u00c2\u00a310,000 more, if that will do it.\"\n\n\"I don't think I can bargain,\" said the son.\n\n\"But he can,\" said the father. \"At any rate you can find out whether\nhe will name a price. I'd go myself, but I know I should quarrel with\nhim.\"\n\nRalph prepared himself for the journey, and, as a matter of course,\ntook the parson into his confidence; not telling the parson anything\nof the absolute sum named, but explaining that it was his purpose to\nbecome acquainted with the heir, and if possible to learn his views.\n\"You'll find Ralph a very different fellow from what my uncle thinks\nhim,\" said the parson. \"I shall be much mistaken if he does not tell\nyou quite openly what he intends. He is careless about money, but he\nnever was greedy.\" And then they got to other matters. \"You will of\ncourse see the girls at Fulham,\" said the parson.\n\n\"Yes;--I shall manage to get down there.\"\n\nThe story of Gregory's passion for Clarissa was well known to the\nother. Gregory, who would not for worlds have spoken of such a matter\namong his general acquaintance, who could not have brought himself to\nmention it in the presence of two hearers, had told it all to the one\ncompanion who was nearest and dearest to him,--\"I wish I were going\nwith you,\" said the parson.\n\n\"Why not come with me then?\"\n\n\"And yet I don't wish it. If I were in London I doubt whether I would\ngo there. There could be no use in it.\"\n\n\"It is one of those things,\" said Ralph, \"in which a man should never\ndespair as long as there is a possibility.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; people say so. I don't believe in that kind of perseverance\nmyself;--at any rate not with her. She knows her own mind,--as well\nas I know mine. I think I promised her that I would trouble her no\nmore.\"\n\n\"Promises like that are mere pie-crusts,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"Give her my love;--that's all. And don't do that unless you're alone\nwith her. I shall live it down some day, no doubt, but to tell the\ntruth I have made up my mind not to marry. I'm half inclined to think\nthat a clergyman shouldn't marry. There are some things which our\nancestors understood pretty well, although we think they were such\nfools. I should like to see the new cousin, certainly.\"\n\nRalph said nothing more about the new cousin; and was perhaps hardly\naware how greatly the idea of again seeing the new cousin had\nenhanced the pleasure of his journey to London. About a week after\nthis he started, having devoted nearly all the afternoon before\nhe went to the packing of a large basket of ferns,--to each root\nor small bundle of which was appended a long name in Latin,--as an\noffering to Patience Underwood. And yet he did not care very much for\nPatience Underwood.\n\nIt was just the end of September,--the last day of September, when\nhe reached London. Ralph the heir was out of town, and the servant\nat his lodging professed she did not know where he was. She thought\nit probable that he was \"at Mr. 'Orsball's,--Mr. 'Orsball of the\nMoonbeam, Barnfield,--a-looking after his 'orses.\" She suggested\nthis, not from any knowledge in her possession, but because Ralph was\nalways believed to go to the Moonbeam when he left town. He would,\nhowever, be back next week. His namesake, therefore, did not consider\nthat it would be expedient for him to follow the heir down to the\nMoonbeam.\n\nBut the Underwood girls would certainly be at Fulham, and he started\nat once with his ferns for Popham Villa. He found them at home, and,\nsingular to say, he found Sir Thomas there also. On the very next\nmorning Sir Thomas was to start for Percycross, to commence the\nactual work of his canvass. The canvass was to occupy a fortnight,\nand on Monday the sixteenth the candidates were to be nominated.\nTuesday the seventeenth was the day of the election. The whole\nhousehold was so full of the subject that at first there was hardly\nroom for the ferns. \"Oh, Mr. Newton, we are so much obliged to you.\nPapa is going to stand for Percycross.\" That, or nearly that, was the\nform in which the ferns were received. Newton was quite contented. An\nexcuse for entering the house was what he had wanted, and his excuse\nwas deemed ample. Sir Thomas, who was disposed to be very civil to\nthe stranger, had not much to say about his own prospects. To a\ncertain degree he was ashamed of Percycross, and had said very little\nabout it even to Stemm since his personal acquaintance had been made\nwith Messrs. Spiveycomb, Pile, and Pabsby. But the girls were not\nashamed of Percycross. To them as yet Percycross was the noblest of\nall British boroughs. Had not the Conservatives of Percycross chosen\ntheir father to be their representative out of all British subjects?\nSir Thomas had tried, but had tried quite in vain, to make them\nunderstand the real fashion of the selection. If Percycross would\nonly send him to Parliament, Percycross should be divine. \"What d'you\nthink?\" said Clary; \"there's a man of the name of--. I wish you'd\nguess the name of this man who is going to stand against papa, Mr.\nNewton.\"\n\n\"The name won't make much difference,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"Ontario Moggs!\" said Clary. \"Do you think it possible, Mr. Newton,\nthat Percycross,--the town where one of the Percys set up a cross in\nthe time of the Crusaders,--didn't he, papa?--\"\n\n\"I shall not consider myself bound to learn all that unless they\nelect me,\" said Sir Thomas; \"but I don't think there were Percys in\nthe days of the Crusaders.\"\n\n\"At any rate, the proper name is Percy St. Cross,\" said Clary. \"Could\nsuch a borough choose Ontario Moggs to be one of its members, Mr.\nNewton?\"\n\n\"I do like the name,\" said Mary Bonner.\n\n\"Perhaps papa and Ontario Moggs may be the two members,\" said Clary,\nlaughing. \"If so, you must bring him down here, papa. Only he's a\nshoemaker.\"\n\n\"That makes no difference in these days,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\nThe ferns were at last unpacked, and the three girls were profuse in\ntheir thanks. Who does not know how large a space a basket of ferns\nwill cover when it is unpacked and how large the treasure looms.\n\"They'll cover the rocks on the other side,\" said Mary. It seemed to\nNewton that Mary Bonner was more at home than she had been when he\nhad seen her before, spoke more freely of what concerned the house,\nand was beginning to become one of the family. But still she was, as\nit were, overshadowed by Clarissa. In appearance, indeed, she was the\nqueen among the three, but in active social life she did not compete\nwith Clary. Patience stood as a statue on a pedestal, by no means\nunobserved and ignored; beautiful in form, but colourless. Newton, as\nhe looked at the three, wondered that a man so quiet and gentle as\nthe young parson should have chosen such a love as Clary Underwood.\nHe remained half the day at the villa, dining there at the invitation\nof Sir Thomas. \"My last dinner,\" said Sir Thomas, \"unless I am lucky\nenough to be rejected. Men when they are canvassing never dine;--and\nnot often after they're elected.\"\n\nThe guest had not much opportunity of ingratiating himself specially\nwith the beauty; but the beauty did so far ingratiate herself with\nhim,--unconsciously on her part,--that he half resolved that should\nhis father be successful in his present enterprise, he would ask Mary\nBonner to be the Queen of Newton Priory. His father had often urged\nhim to marry,--never suggesting that any other quality beyond good\nlooks would be required in his son's wife. He had never spoken of\nmoney, or birth, or name. \"I have an idea,\" he had said, laughing,\n\"that you'll marry a fright some day. I own I should like to have a\npretty woman about the house. One doesn't expect much from a woman,\nbut she is bound to be pretty.\" This woman was at any rate pretty.\nPretty, indeed! Was it possible that any woman should be framed more\nlovely than this one? But he must bide his time. He would not ask any\ngirl to marry him till he should know what position he could ask her\nto fill. But though he spoke little to Mary, he treated her as men do\ntreat women whom they desire to be allowed to love. There was a tone\nin his voice, a worship in his eye, and a flush upon his face, and a\nhesitation in his manner, which told the story, at any rate to one\nof the party there. \"He didn't come to bring you the ferns,\" said\nClarissa to Patience.\n\n\"He brought them for all of us,\" said Patience.\n\n\"Young men don't go about with ferns for the sake of the ferns,\" said\nClary. \"They were merely an excuse to come and see Mary.\"\n\n\"Why shouldn't he come and see Mary?\"\n\n\"He has my leave, Patty. I think it would be excellent. Isn't it odd\nthat there should be two Ralph Newtons. One would be Mrs. Newton and\nthe other Mrs. Ralph.\"\n\n\"Clarissa, Clarissa!\" said Patience, almost in a tone of agony.\n\n\"I'll be a hypocrite if you choose, Patty,\" said Clarissa, \"or I'll\nbe true. But you can't have me both at once.\" Patience said nothing\nfurther then. The lesson of self-restraint which she desired to teach\nwas very hard of teaching.\n\nThere was just a word spoken between Sir Thomas and Newton about the\nproperty. \"I intend to see Ralph Newton, if I can find him,\" said\nRalph who was not the heir.\n\n\"I don't think he is far from town,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"My father thinks that we might come to an understanding.\"\n\n\"Perhaps so,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"I have no strong anxiety on the subject myself,\" said Newton; \"but\nmy father thinks that if he does wish to sell his reversion--\"\n\n\"He doesn't wish it. How can a man wish it?\"\n\n\"Under the circumstances it may be desirable.\"\n\n\"You had better see him, and I think he will tell you,\" said Sir\nThomas. \"You must understand that a man thinks much of such a\nposition. Pray come to us again. We shall always be glad to see you\nwhen you are in town.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV.\n\n\"I FIND I MUST.\"\n\n\nRalph the heir had, after all, gone to Margate. Mr. Neefit had got\nsuch a hold upon him that he had no help for it. He found himself\nforced to go to Margate. When he was asked the second and third time,\nwith all the energy of Mr. Neefit's eloquence, he was unable to\nresist. What reason could he give that he should not go to Margate,\nseeing that it was a thing quite understood that he was to endeavour\nto persuade Polly to be his wife. Neefit came to him two mornings\nrunning, catching him each morning just as he was smoking his cigar\nafter breakfast, and was very eloquent. He already owed Mr. Neefit\nover five hundred pounds, and the debt on the first of these mornings\nwas made up to one thousand pounds, a receipt being given for\nthe shop debt on one side, and a bond for the whole money, with\n5 per cent. interest, being taken in return for it. \"You'd better\npay off what little things you owes, Captain,\" said the generous\nbreeches-maker, \"and then, when the time comes, we'll settle with the\ngent about the 'orses.\" Neefit played his game very well. He said\nnot a word about selling the horses, or as to any restriction on his\nyoung \"Captain's\" amusements. If you pull at your fish too hard you\nonly break your line. Neefit had a very fine fish on his hook, and he\nmeant to land it. Not a word was said about Margate on that occasion,\ntill the little pecuniary transaction was completed. Then the Captain\nwas informed that the Neefit family would certainly spend the next\nweek at that marine Paradise, and that Polly expected \"the Captain's\"\ncompany. \"Them's the places,\" said Neefit, \"where a girl grows soft\nas butter.\" This he said when the door-handle was in his hand, so\nthat \"the Captain\" had no chance of answering him. Then he came again\nthe next morning, and returned to the subject as though \"the Captain\"\nhad already consented. There was a near approach to anger on one side\nand determined opposition on the other during this interview, but\nit ended in acquiescence on the Captain's side. Then Mr. Neefit was\nonce more as gracious as possible. The graciousness of such men in\nacknowledging their own inferiority is sometimes wonderful. \"You\nneedn't be seen about with me, you know,\" said Mr. Neefit. This\nwas said after Ralph had positively declared that he would not go\nactually with the Neefits and occupy the same apartments. \"It would\nbe altogether wrong,--for Polly's sake,\" said Ralph, looking very\nwise and very moral. To this view Neefit assented, not being quite\nsure how far \"the Captain\" might be correct in his ideas of morality.\n\n\"They've been and fixed young Newton for Polly,\" said Mr. Waddle that\nmorning, to his friend Herr Bawwah, when he was told to mark off\nRalph's account in the books as settled. \"Dashed if they 'aven't,\"\nthe German grunted. \"Old Neverfit's a-playing at 'igh game, ain't\nhe?\" Such was the most undeserved nickname by which this excellent\ntradesman was known in his own establishment. \"I don't see nodin\nabout 'igh,\" said the German. \"He ain't got no money. I call it low.\"\nWaddle endeavoured to explain the circumstances, but failed. \"De\npeoples should be de peoples, and de nobles should be de nobles,\"\nsaid Herr Bawwah;--a doctrine which was again unintelligible to Mr.\nWaddle.\n\nRalph having overcome an intense desire to throw over his engagement,\nto sell his horses, and to start for Jerusalem, did go down to\nMargate. He put himself up at an hotel there, eat his dinner, lighted\na cigar, and went down upon the sands. It was growing dusk, and he\nthought that he should be alone,--or, at least, uninterrupted in\na crowd. The crowd was there, and nobody in the place would know\nhim,--except the Neefits. He had not been on the sands two minutes\nbefore he encountered Mr. Neefit and his daughter. The breeches-maker\ntalked loud, and was extremely happy. Polly smiled, and was very\npretty. In two minutes Neefit saw, or pretended to see, a friend, and\nRalph was left with his lady-love. There never was so good-natured a\nfather! \"You'll bring her home to tea, Captain,\" said the father, as\nhe walked off.\n\nOn that occasion, Ralph abstained from all direct love-making,\nand Polly, when she found that it was to be so, made herself very\npleasant. \"The idea of your being at Margate, Mr. Newton,\" said\nPolly.\n\n\"Why not I, as well as another?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know. Brighton, or some of those French places, or any\nwhere all about the world, would be more likely for you, I should\nthink.\"\n\n\"Margate seems to be very jolly.\"\n\n\"Oh, I like it. But then we are not swells, you know. Have you\nheard the news? Ontario Moggs is going to stand to be 'member of\nParliament' for Percycross.\"\n\n\"My rival!\" That was the only word he uttered approaching to the\nsubject of love.\n\n\"I don't know anything about that, Mr. Newton. But it's true.\"\n\n\"Why, Sir Thomas Underwood is going to stand.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about anybody else, but Ontario Moggs is\ngoing to stand. I do so hope he'll get in. They say he speaks quite\nbeautiful. Did you ever hear him?\"\n\n\"I never heard him.\"\n\n\"Ah, you may laugh. But a bootmaker can make a speech sometimes as\nwell as,--as well as a peer of Parliament. Father says that old Mr.\nMoggs has given him ever so much money to do it. When a man is in\nParliament, Mr. Newton, doesn't that make him a gentleman?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Nothing on earth can make a man a gentleman. You don't understand\nLatin, Polly?\"\n\n\"No. I hope that isn't necessary for a young woman.\"\n\n\"By no means. But a poet is born, and can't be made.\"\n\n\"I'm not talking of poets. Ontario Moggs is a poet. But I know what\nyou mean. There's something better even than to be a gentleman.\"\n\n\"One may be an angel,--as you are, Polly.\"\n\n\"Oh,--me;--I'm not thinking of myself. I'm thinking of Ontario\nMoggs,--going into Parliament. But then he is so clever!\"\n\nRalph was not minded to be cut out by Moggs, junior, after coming all\nthe way to Margate after his lady-love. The thing was to be done, and\nhe would do it. But not to-night. Then he took Polly home, and eat\nprawns with Mr. and Mrs. Neefit. On the next day they all went out\ntogether in a boat.\n\nThe week was nearly over, and Ralph had renewed his suit more than\nonce, when the breeches-maker proceeded to \"put him through his\nfacings.\" \"She's a-coming round, ain't she, Captain?\" said Mr.\nNeefit. By this time Ralph hated the sight of Neefit so thoroughly,\nthat he was hardly able to repress the feeling. Indeed, he did not\nrepress it. Whether Neefit did not see it, or seeing it chose to\nignore the matter, cannot be said. He was, at any rate, as courteous\nas ever. Mrs. Neefit, overcome partly by her husband's authority,\nand partly induced to believe that as Ontario Moggs was going into\nParliament he was no longer to be regarded as a possible husband,\nhad yielded, and was most polite to the lover. When he came in of an\nevening, she always gave him a double allowance of prawns, and hoped\nthat the tea was to his liking. But she said very little more than\nthis, standing somewhat in awe of him. Polly had been changeable,\nconsenting to walk with him every day, but always staving the matter\noff when he asked her whether she thought that she yet knew him well\nenough to be his wife. \"Oh, not half well enough,\" she would say.\n\"And then, perhaps, you know, I'm not over fond of the half that I\ndo know.\" And so it was up to the last evening, when the father put\nhim through his facings. In respect of \"the Captain's\" behaviour to\nPolly, the father had no just ground of complaint, for Ralph had done\nhis best. Indeed, Ralph was fond enough of Polly. And it was hard\nfor a man to be much with her without becoming fond of her. \"She's\na-coming round, ain't she, Captain?\" said Mr. Neefit.\n\n\"I can't say that she is,\" said Ralph, turning upon his heel near the\nend of the pier.\n\n\"You don't stick to her fast enough, Captain.\"\n\nThis was not to be borne. \"I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Neefit,\"\nsaid Ralph, \"you'd better let me alone, or else I shall be off.\"\n\n\"You'd only have to come back, Captain, you know,\" said Neefit. \"Not\nas I want to interfere. You're on the square, I see that. As long\nas you're on the square, there ain't nothing I won't do. I ain't\na-blaming you,--only stick to her.\" \"Damn it all!\" said Ralph,\nturning round again in the other direction. But there was Neefit\nstill confronting him. \"Only stick to her, Captain, and we'll pull\nthrough. I'll put her through her facings to-night. She's thinking\nof that orkard lout of a fellow just because he's standing to be a\nParl'ament gent.\" This did not improve matters, and Ralph absolutely\nran away,--ran away, and escaped to his hotel. He would try again in\nthe morning, would still make her his wife if she would have him! And\nthen swore a solemn oath that in such case he would never see his\nfather-in-law again.\n\nPolly was not at all averse to giving him opportunities. They were\ntogether on the sands on the next morning, and he then asked her very\nseriously whether she did not think that there had been enough of\nthis, that they might make up their minds to love each other, and be\nmarried as it were out of hand. Her father and mother wished it, and\nwhat was there against it? \"You cannot doubt that I am in earnest\nnow, Polly?\" he said.\n\n\"I know you are in earnest well enough,\" she answered.\n\n\"And you do not doubt that I love you?\"\n\n\"I doubt very much whether you love father,\" said Polly. She spoke\nthis so sharp and quickly that he had no reply ready. \"If you and\nI were to be married, where should we live? I should want to have\nfather and mother with me. You'd mean that, I suppose?\" The girl had\nread his thoughts, and he hadn't a word to say for himself. \"The\ntruth is, you despise father, Mr. Newton.\"\n\n\"No, indeed.\"\n\n\"Yes, you do. I can see it. And perhaps it's all right that you\nshould. I'm not saying-- Of course, he's not like you and your\npeople. How should he be? Only I'm thinking, like should marry like.\"\n\n\"Polly, you're fit for any position in which a man could place you.\"\n\n\"No, I'm not. I'm not fit for any place as father wouldn't be fit for\ntoo. I'd make a better hand at it than father, I dare say,--because\nI'm younger. But I won't go anywhere where folk is to be ashamed of\nfather. I'd like to be a lady well enough;--but it'd go against the\nvery grain of my heart if I had a house and he wasn't to be made\nwelcome to the best of everything.\"\n\n\"Polly, you're an angel!\"\n\n\"I'm a young woman who knows who's been good to me. He's to give me\npretty nigh everything. You wouldn't be taking me if it wasn't for\nthat. And then, after all, I'm to turn my back on him because he\nain't like your people. No; never; Mr. Newton! You're well enough,\nMr. Newton; more than good enough for me, no doubt. But I won't do\nit. I'd cut my heart out if I was turning my back upon father.\" She\nhad spoken out with a vengeance, and Ralph didn't know that there was\nany more to be said. He couldn't bring himself to assure her that\nMr. Neefit would be a welcome guest in his house. At this moment the\nbreeches-maker was so personally distasteful to him that he had not\nforce enough in him to tell a lie upon the matter. They were now\nat the entrance of the pier, at which their ways would separate.\n\"Good-bye, Mr. Newton,\" said she. \"There had better be an end of\nit;--hadn't there?\" \"Goodbye, Polly,\" he said, pressing her hand as\nhe left her.\n\nPolly, walked up home with a quick step, with a tear in her eye, and\nwith grave thoughts in her heart. It would have been very nice. She\ncould have loved him, and she felt the attraction, and the softness,\nand the sweet-smelling delicateness of gentle associations. It would\nhave been very nice. But she could not sever herself from her father.\nShe could understand that he must be distasteful to such a man as\nRalph Newton. She would not blame Ralph. But the fact that it was so,\nshut for her the door of that Elysium. She knew that she could not\nbe happy were she to be taken to such a mode of life as would force\nher to accuse herself of ingratitude to her father. And so Ralph went\nback to town without again seeing the breeches-maker.\n\nThe first thing he found in his lodgings was a note from his\nnamesake.\n\n\n   DEAR SIR,--\n\n   I am up in town, and am very anxious to see you in respect\n   of the arrangements which have been proposed respecting\n   the property. Will you fix a meeting as soon as you are\n   back?\n\n   Yours always,\n\n   RALPH NEWTON.\n\n   Charing Cross Hotel, 2 Oct., 186--.\n\n\nOf course he would see his namesake. Why not? And why not take his\nuncle's money, and pay off Neefit, and have done with it? Neefit must\nbe paid off, let the money come from where it would. He called at\nthe hotel, and not finding his cousin, left a note asking him to\nbreakfast on the following morning; and then he spent the remainder\nof that day in renewed doubt. He was so sick of Neefit,--whose manner\nof eating shrimps had been a great offence added to other offences!\nAnd yet one of his great sorrows was that he should lose Polly.\nPolly in her way was perfect, and he felt almost sure, now, that\nPolly loved him. Girls had no right to cling to their fathers after\nmarriage. There was Scripture warranty against it. And yet the manner\nin which she had spoken of her father had greatly added to his\nadmiration.\n\nThe two Ralphs breakfasted together, not having met each other since\nthey were children, and having even then scarcely known each other.\nRalph the heir had been brought up a boy at the parsonage of Newton\nPeele, but the other Ralph had never been taken to Newton till after\nhis grandfather's death. The late parson had died within twelve\nmonths of his father,--a wretched year, during which the Squire and\nthe parson had always squabbled,--and then Ralph who was the heir\nhad been transferred to the guardianship of Sir Thomas Underwood. It\nwas only during the holidays of that one year that the two Ralphs\nhad been together. The \"Dear Sir\" will probably be understood by the\ndiscerning reader. The Squire's son had never allowed himself to call\neven Gregory his cousin. Ralph the heir in writing back had addressed\nhim as \"Dear Ralph.\" The Squire's son thought that that was very\nwell, but chose that any such term of familiarity should come first\nfrom him who was in truth a Newton. He felt his condition, though he\nwas accustomed to make so light of it to his father.\n\nThe two young men shook hands together cordially, and were soon\nat work upon their eggs and kidneys. They immediately began about\nGregory and the parsonage and the church, and the big house. The\nheir to the property, though he had not been at Newton for fourteen\nyears, remembered well its slopes, and lawns, and knolls, and little\nvalleys. He asked after this tree and that, of this old man and that\nold woman, of the game, and the river fishery, and the fox coverts,\nand the otters of which three or four were reputed to be left when\nhe was there. Otters it seems were gone, but the foxes were there in\nplenty. \"My father would be half mad if they drew the place blank,\"\nsaid the Squire's son.\n\n\"Does my uncle hunt much?\"\n\n\"Every Monday and Saturday, and very often on the Wednesday.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"I call myself a three-day man, but I often make a fourth. Garth must\nbe very far off if he don't see me. I don't do much with any other\npack.\"\n\n\"Does my uncle ride?\"\n\n\"Yes; he goes pretty well;--he says he don't. If he gets well away I\nthink he rides as hard as ever he did. He don't like a stern chace.\"\n\n\"No more do I,\" said Ralph the heir. \"But I'm often driven to make\nit. What can a fellow do? An old chap turns round and goes home, and\ndoesn't feel ashamed of himself; but we can't do that. That's the\ntime when one ruins his horses.\" Then he told all about the Moonbeam\nand the B. & B., and his own stud. The morning was half gone, and not\na word had been said about business.\n\nThe Squire's son felt that it was so, and rushed at the subject all\nin a hurry. \"I told you what I have come up to town about.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; I understand.\"\n\n\"I suppose I may speak plainly,\" said the Squire's son.\n\n\"Why not?\" said Ralph the heir.\n\n\"Well; I don't know. Of course it's best. You wrote to Carey, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Yes; I wrote the very moment I had made up my mind.\"\n\n\"You had made up your mind, then?\"\n\nRalph had certainly made up his mind when he wrote the letter of\nwhich they were speaking, but he was by no means sure but that his\nmind was not made up now in another direction. Since he had become\nso closely intimate with Mr. Neefit, and since Polly had so clearly\nexplained to him her ideas as to paternal duty, his mind had veered\nround many points. \"Yes,\" said he. \"I had made up my mind.\"\n\n\"I don't suppose it can be of any use for you and me to be bargaining\ntogether,\" said the other Ralph.\n\n\"Not in the least.\"\n\n\"Of course it's a great thing to be heir to Newton. It's a nice\nproperty, and all that. Only my father thought--\"\n\n\"He thought that I wanted money,\" said Ralph the heir.\n\n\"Just that.\"\n\n\"So I do. God knows I do. I would tell you everything. I would\nindeed. As to screwing a hard bargain, I'm the last man in London who\nwould do it. I thought that your father might be willing to buy half\nthe property.\"\n\n\"He won't do that. You see the great thing is the house and park. We\nshould both want that;--shouldn't we? Of course it must be yours; and\nI feel--I don't know how I feel in asking you whether you want to\nsell it.\"\n\n\"You needn't mind that, Ralph.\"\n\n\"If you don't think the sum the lawyers and those chaps fixed is\nenough,--\"\n\nThen Ralph the heir, interrupting him, rose from his chair and spoke\nout. \"My uncle has never understood me, and never will. He thinks\nhardly of me, and if he chooses to do so, I can't help it. He hasn't\nseen me for fourteen years, and of course he is entitled to think\nwhat he pleases. If he would have seen me the thing might have been\neasier.\"\n\n\"Don't let us go back to that, Ralph,\" said the Squire's son.\n\n\"I don't want to go back to anything. When it comes to a fellow's\nparting with such prospects as mine, it does come very hard upon\nhim. Of course it's my own fault. I might have got along well\nenough;--only I haven't. I am hard up for money,--very hard up. And\nyet,--if you were in my place, you wouldn't like to part with it.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" said the Squire's son, not knowing what to say.\n\n\"As to bargaining, and asking so much more, and all the rest of it,\nthat's out of the question. Somebody fixed a price, and I suppose he\nknew what he was at.\"\n\n\"That was a minimum price.\"\n\n\"I understand. It was all fair, I don't doubt. It didn't seem a great\ndeal; but your father might live for thirty years.\"\n\n\"I hope he will,\" said the Squire's son.\n\n\"As for standing off for more money, I never dreamed of such a thing.\nIf your father thinks that, he has wronged me. But I believe he\nalways does wrong me. And about the building, and the trees, and the\nleases, and the house, he might do just as he pleased for me. I have\nnever said a word, and never shall. I must say I sometimes think he\nhas been hard upon me. In fourteen years he has never asked me to set\nmy foot upon the estate, that I might see the place which must one\nday be mine.\"\n\nThis was an accusation which the Squire's son found it very difficult\nto answer. It could not be answered without a reference to his own\nbirth, and it was almost impossible that he should explain his\nfather's feelings on the subject. \"If this were settled, we should be\nglad that you would come,\" he said.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ralph the heir; \"yes,--if I consented to give up\neverything that is mine by right. Do you think that a fellow can\nbring himself to abandon all that so easily? It's like tearing a\nfellow's heart out of him. If I'll do that, my uncle will let me come\nand see what it is that I have lost! That which would induce him to\nwelcome me would make it impossible that I should go there. It may be\nthat I shall sell it. I suppose I shall. But I will never look at it\nafterwards.\" As it came to this point, the tears were streaming down\nhis cheeks, and the eyes of the other Ralph were not dry.\n\n\"I wish it could be made pleasant for us all,\" said the Squire's son.\nThe wish was well enough, but the expression of it was hardly needed,\nbecause it must be so general.\n\n\"But all this is rot and nonsense,\" said Ralph the heir, brushing\nthe tears away from his eyes, \"and I am only making an ass of myself.\nYour father wants to know whether I will sell the reversion to Newton\nPriory. I will. I find I must. I don't know whether I wouldn't sooner\ncut my throat; but unless I cut my throat I must sell it. I had a\nmeans of escape, but that has gone by. When I wrote that letter there\nwas a means of escape. Now there's none.\"\n\n\"Ralph,\" said the other.\n\n\"Well; speak on. I've about said all I've got to say. Only don't\nthink I want to ballyrag about the money. That's right enough, no\ndoubt. If there's more to come, the people that have to look to it\nwill say so. I'm not going to be a Jew about it.\"\n\n\"Ralph; I wouldn't do anything in a hurry. I won't take your answer\nin a hurry like this.\"\n\n\"It's no good, my dear fellow, I must do it. I must have \u00c2\u00a35,000 at\nonce.\"\n\n\"You can get that from an insurance office.\"\n\n\"And then I should have nothing to live on. I must do it. I have no\nway out of it,--except cutting my throat.\"\n\nThe Squire's son paused a moment, thinking. \"I was told by my\nfather,\" said he, \"to offer you more money.\"\n\n\"If it's worth more the people will say so,\" said Ralph the heir,\nimpetuously; \"I do not want to sell it for more than it's worth. Ask\nthem to settle it immediately. There are people I must pay money to\nat once.\"\n\nAnd so the Squire's son had done the Squire's errand. When he\nreported his success to Mr. Carey, that gentleman asked him whether\nhe had the heir's consent in writing. At this the successful buyer\nwas almost disposed to be angry; but Mr. Carey softened him by an\nacknowledgment that he had done more than could have been expected.\n\"I'll see his lawyer to-morrow,\" said Mr. Carey, \"and then, unless\nhe changes his mind again, we'll soon have it settled.\" After that\nthe triumphant negotiator sent a telegram home to his father, \"It is\nsettled, and the purchase is made.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV.\n\n\"MR. GRIFFENBOTTOM.\"\n\n\nOn Monday, the 16th of October, Sir Thomas Underwood went down\nto Percycross, and the first information given him was that Mr.\nWestmacott and Ontario Moggs had arrived on the Saturday, and were\nalready at work. Mr. Griffenbottom was expected early on the Tuesday.\n\"They've stolen a march on us, then,\" said Sir Thomas to Mr. Trigger.\n\n\"Give 'em rope enough, and they'll hang themselves,\" replied the\nmanaging agent. \"There was Moggs spouting to them on his own hook on\nSaturday night, and Westmacott's chaps are ready to eat him. And he\nwanted to be doing it yesterday, Sunday; only some of them got a hold\nof him and wouldn't let him loose. Moggs is a great card for us, Sir\nThomas. There's nothing like one of them spouting fellows to overset\nthe coach.\"\n\n\"Mr. Westmacott is fond of that too,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"He understands. He's used to it. He does it in the proper place.\nWestmacott wasn't a bad member for the place;--wasn't perhaps quite\nfree enough with his money, but Westmacott was very decent.\" Sir\nThomas could not help feeling that Trigger spoke of it as though he\nwished that the two old members might be returned. Ah, well! had\nit been possible, Mr. Trigger would have wished it. Mr. Trigger\nunderstood the borough, knew well the rocks before them, and\nwould have wished it,--although he had been so imperative with Mr.\nGriffenbottom as to the second conservative candidate. And now Mr.\nGriffenbottom had sent them a man who would throw all the fat in the\nfire by talking of purity of election! \"And Moggs has been making a\nfool of himself in another direction,\" said Trigger, thinking that\nno opportunity for giving a valuable hint should be lost. \"He's been\ntelling the working men already that they'll be scoundrels and knaves\nif they take so much as a glass of beer without paying for it.\"\n\n\"Scoundrel is a strong word,\" said Sir Thomas, \"but I like him for\nthat.\"\n\n\"Percycross won't like him. Men would rather have all that left to\ntheir own feelings. They who want beer or money certainly won't thank\nhim; and they who don't want it don't like to be suspected.\"\n\n\"Every one will take it as addressed to his neighbour and not to\nhimself.\"\n\n\"We are very fond of our neighbours here, Sir Thomas, and that kind\nof thing won't go down.\" This was on the evening of the candidate's\narrival, and the conversation was going on absolutely while Sir\nThomas was eating his dinner. He had asked Mr. Trigger to join him,\nand Mr. Trigger had faintly alleged that he had dined at three; but\nhe soon so far changed his mind as to be able to express an opinion\nthat he could \"pick a bit,\" and he did pick a bit. After which he\ndrank the best part of a bottle of port,--having assured Sir Thomas\nthat the port at the Percy Standard was a sort of wine that one\ndidn't get every day. And as he drank his port, he continued to pour\nin lessons of wisdom. Sir Thomas employed his mind the while in\nwondering when Mr. Trigger would go away, and forecasting whether\nMr. Trigger would desire to drink port wine at the Percy Standard\nevery evening during the process of canvassing. About nine o'clock\nthe waiter announced that a few gentlemen below desired to see Sir\nThomas. \"Our friends,\" said Mr. Trigger. \"Just put chairs, and bring\na couple of bottles of port, John. I'm glad they're come, Sir Thomas,\nbecause it shows that they mean to take to you.\" Up they were shown,\nMessrs. Spiveycomb, Spicer, Pile, Roodylands,--the bootmaker who\nhas not yet been named,--Pabsby, and seven or eight others. Sir\nThomas shook hands with them all. He observed that Mr. Trigger was\nespecially cordial in his treatment of Spicer, the mustard-maker,--as\nto whose defection he had been so fearful in consequence of certain\npower which Mr. Westmacott might have in the wholesale disposal of\nmustard. \"I hope you find yourself better,\" said Mr. Pile, opening\nthe conversation. Sir Thomas assured his new friend that he was\npretty well. \"'Cause you seemed rayther down on your luck when you\nwas here before,\" said Mr. Pile.\n\n\"No need for that,\" said Spicer, the man of mustard. \"Is there,\nTrigger?\" Trigger sat a little apart, with one bottle of port wine at\nhis elbow, and took no part in the conversation. He was aware that\nhis opportunities were so great that the outside supporters ought to\nhave their time. \"Any objection to this, Sir Thomas?\" he said, taking\na cigar-case out of his pocket. Sir Thomas, who hated tobacco, of\ncourse gave permission. Trigger rang the bell, ordered cigars for\nthe party, and then sat apart with his port wine. In ten minutes Sir\nThomas hardly knew where he was, so dense was the cloud of smoke.\n\n\"Sir Thomas,\" began Mr. Pabsby,--\"if I could only clearly see my\nway--\"\n\n\"You'll see it clear enough before nomination-day,\" said Mr. Pile.\n\n\"Any ways, after election,\" said a conservative grocer. Both these\ngentlemen belonged to the Established Church and delighted in\nsnubbing Mr. Pabsby. Indeed, Mr. Pabsby had no business at this\nmeeting, and so he had been told very plainly by one or two as he had\njoined them in the street. He explained, however, that his friend Sir\nThomas had come to him the very first person in Percycross, and he\ncarried his point in joining the party. But he was a mild man, and\nwhen he was interrupted he merely bided another opportunity.\n\n\"I hope, Sir Thomas, your mind is made up to do something for our\ntrade,\" said Mr. Roodylands.\n\n\"What's the matter with your trade?\" said Spiveycomb, the\npaper-maker.\n\n\"Well;--we ain't got no jobs in it;--that's the matter,\" said Mr.\nPile.\n\n\"As for jobs, what's the odds?\" said a big and burly loud-mouthed\ntanner. \"All on us likes a good thing when it comes in our way. Stow\nthat, and don't let's be told about jobs. Sir Thomas, here's your\nhealth, and I wish you at the top of the poll,--that is, next to\nMr. Griffenbottom.\" Then they all drank to Sir Thomas's health, Mr.\nPabsby filling himself a bumper for the occasion.\n\nIt was eleven before they went away, at which time Mr. Pabsby had\nthree times got as far as a declaration of his wish to see things\nclearly. Further than this he could not get; but still he went away\nin perfect good humour. He would have another opportunity, as he took\noccasion to whisper when he shook hands with the candidate. Trigger\nstayed even yet for half-an-hour. \"Don't waste your time on that\nfellow, Pabsby,\" he said. \"No, I won't,\" said Sir Thomas. \"And be\nvery civil to old Pile.\" \"He doesn't seem disposed to return the\ncompliment,\" said Sir Thomas. \"But he doesn't want your interest\nin the borough,\" said Trigger, with the air of a man who had great\ntruths to teach. \"In electioneering, Sir Thomas, it's mostly the same\nas in other matters. Nothing's to be had for nothing. If you were a\nretail seller of boots from Manchester old Pile would be civil enough\nto you. You may snub Spicer as much as you please, because he'll\nexpect to get something out of you.\" \"He'll be very much deceived,\"\nsaid Sir Thomas. \"I'm not so sure of that,\" said Trigger;--\"Spicer\nknows what he's about pretty well.\" Then, at last, Mr. Trigger went,\nassuring Sir Thomas most enthusiastically that he would be with him\nbefore nine the next morning.\n\nMany distressing thoughts took possession of Sir Thomas as he lay in\nbed. He had made up his mind that he would in no way break the law,\nand he didn't know whether he had not broken it already by giving\nthese people tobacco and wine. And yet it would have been impossible\nfor him to have refused Mr. Trigger permission to order the supply.\nEven for the sake of the seat,--even for the sake of his reputation,\nwhich was so much dearer to him than the seat,--he could not have\nbidden guests, who had come to him in his own room, to go elsewhere\nif they required wine. It was a thing not to be done, and yet, for\naught he knew, Mr. Trigger might continue to order food and wine, and\nbeer and tobacco, to be supplied ad libitum, and whenever he chose.\nHow was he to put an end to it, otherwise than by throwing up the\ngame, and going back to London? That now would be gross ill-usage to\nthe Conservatives of Percycross, who by such a step would be left in\nthe lurch without a candidate. And then was it to be expected that he\nshould live for a week with Mr. Trigger, with no other relief than\nthat which would be afforded by Messrs. Pile, Spiveycomb, and Co.\nEverything about him was reeking of tobacco. And then, when he sat\ndown to breakfast at nine o'clock there would be Mr. Trigger!\n\nThe next morning he was out of bed at seven, and ordered his\nbreakfast at eight sharp. He would steal a march on Trigger. He went\nout into the sitting-room, and there was Trigger already seated\nin the arm-chair, studying the list of the voters of Percycross!\nHeavens, what a man! \"I thought I'd look in early, and they told me\nyou were coming out or I'd have just stepped into your room.\" Into\nhis very bed-room! Sir Thomas shuddered as he heard the proposition.\n\"We've a telegram from Griffenbottom,\" continued Trigger, \"and he\nwon't be here till noon. We can't begin till he comes.\"\n\n\"Ah;--then I can just write a few letters,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"I wouldn't mind letters now if I was you. If you don't mind, we'll\ngo and look up the parsons. There are four or five of 'em, and they\nlike to be seen;--not in the way of canvassing. They're all right, of\ncourse. And there's two of 'em won't leave a stone unturned in the\noutside hamlets. But they like to be seen, and their wives like it.\"\nWhereupon Mr. Trigger ordered breakfast,--and eat it. Sir Thomas\nreminded himself that a fortnight was after all but a short duration\nof time. He might live through a fortnight,--probably,--and then when\nMr. Griffenbottom came it would be shared between two.\n\nAt noon he returned to the Percy Standard, very tired, there to await\nthe coming of Mr. Griffenbottom. Mr. Griffenbottom didn't come till\nthree, and then bustled up into the sitting-room, which Sir Thomas\nhad thought was his own, as though all Percycross belonged to\nhim. During the last three hours supporters had been in and out\ncontinually, and Mr. Pabsby had made an ineffectual attempt or two to\ncatch Sir Thomas alone. Trigger had been going up and down between\nthe Standard and the station. Various men, friends and supporters\nof Griffenbottom and Underwood, had been brought to him. Who were\npaid agents, who were wealthy townsmen, who were canvassers and\nmessengers, he did not know. There were bottles on the sideboard the\nwhole time. Sir Thomas, in a speculative manner, endeavouring to\nrealise to himself the individuality of this and that stranger, could\nonly conceive that they who helped themselves were wealthy townsmen,\nand that they who waited till they were asked by others were paid\ncanvassers and agents. But he knew nothing, and could only wish\nhimself back in Southampton Buildings.\n\nAt last Mr. Griffenbottom, followed by a cloud of supporters, bustled\ninto the room. Trigger at once introduced the two candidates. \"Very\nglad to meet you,\" said Griffenbottom. \"So we're going to fight\nthis little battle together. I remember you in the House, you know,\nand I dare say you remember me. I'm used to this kind of thing. I\nsuppose you ain't. Well, Trigger, how are things looking? I suppose\nwe'd better begin down Pump Lane. I know my way about the place,\nHoneywood, as well as if it was my bed-room. And so I ought,\nTrigger.\"\n\n\"I suppose you've seen the inside of pretty nearly every house in\nPercycross,\" said Trigger.\n\n\"There's some I don't want to see the inside of any more. I can tell\nyou that. How are these new householders going to vote?\"\n\n\"Betwixt and between, Mr. Griffenbottom.\"\n\n\"I never thought we should find much difference. It don't matter what\nrent a man pays, but what he does. I could tell you how nineteen out\nof twenty men here would vote, if you'd tell me what they did, and\nwho they were. What's to be done about talking to 'em?\"\n\n\"To-morrow night we're to be in the Town Hall, Mr. Griffenbottom, and\nThursday an open-air meeting, with a balcony in the market-place.\"\n\n\"All right. Come along. Are you good at spinning yarns to them,\nHoneywood?\"\n\n\"I don't like it, if you mean that,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"It's better than canvassing. By George, anything is better than\nthat. Come along. We may get Pump Lane, and Petticoat Yard, and\nthose back alleys done before dinner. You've got cards, of course,\nTrigger.\" And the old, accustomed electioneerer led the way out to\nhis work.\n\nMr. Griffenbottom was a heavy hale man, over sixty, somewhat inclined\nto be corpulent, with a red face, and a look of assured impudence\nabout him which nothing could quell or diminish. The kind of\nlife which he had led was one to which impudence was essentially\nnecessary. He had done nothing for the world to justify him in\nassuming the airs of a great man,--but still he could assume them,\nand many believed in him. He could boast neither birth, nor talent,\nnor wit,--nor, indeed, wealth in the ordinary sense of the word.\nThough he had worked hard all his life at the business to which he\nbelonged, he was a poorer man now than he had been thirty years ago.\nIt had all gone in procuring him a seat in Parliament. And he had so\nmuch sense that he never complained. He had known what it was that he\nwanted, and what it was that he must pay for it. He had paid for it,\nand had got it, and was, in his fashion, contented. If he could only\nhave continued to have it without paying for it again, how great\nwould have been the blessing! But he was a man who knew that such\nblessings were not to be expected. After the first feeling of disgust\nwas over on the receipt of Trigger's letter, he put his collar to\nthe work again, and was prepared to draw his purse,--intending,\nof course, that the new candidate should bear as much as possible\nof this drain. He knew well that there was a prospect before him\nof abject misery;--for life without Parliament would be such to\nhim. There would be no salt left for him in the earth if he was\nousted. And yet no man could say why he should have cared to sit in\nParliament. He rarely spoke, and when he did no one listened to him.\nHe was anxious for no political measures. He was a favourite with no\nsection of a party. He spent all his evenings at the House, but it\ncan hardly be imagined that those evenings were pleasantly spent.\nBut he rubbed his shoulders against the shoulders of great men, and\noccasionally stood upon their staircases. At any rate, such as was\nthe life, it was his life; and he had no time left to choose another.\nHe considered himself on this occasion pretty nearly sure to be\nelected. He knew the borough and was sure. But then there was that\naccursed system of petitioning, which according to his idea was\nun-English, ungentlemanlike, and unpatriotic--\"A stand-up fight, and\nif you're licked--take it.\" That was his idea of what an election\nshould be.\n\nSir Thomas, who only just remembered the appearance of the man in the\nHouse, at once took an extravagant dislike to him. It was abominable\nto him to be called Underwood by a man who did not know him. It was\nnauseous to him to be forced into close relations with a man who\nseemed to him to be rough and ill-mannered. And, judging from what\nhe saw, he gave his colleague credit for no good qualities. Now Mr.\nGriffenbottom had good qualities. He was possessed of pluck. He was\nin the main good-natured. And though he could resent an offence with\nferocity, he could forgive an offence with ease. \"Hit him hard, and\nthen have an end of it!\" That was Mr. Griffenbottom's mode of dealing\nwith the offenders and the offences with which he came in contact.\n\nIn every house they entered Griffenbottom was at home, and Sir\nThomas was a stranger of whom the inmates had barely heard the name.\nGriffenbottom was very good at canvassing the poorer classes. He said\nnot a word to them about politics, but asked them all whether they\ndidn't dislike that fellow Gladstone, who was one thing one day\nand another thing another day. \"By G----, nobody knows what he is,\"\nswore Mr. Griffenbottom over and over again. The women mostly said\nthat they didn't know, but they liked the blue. \"Blues allays was\ngallanter nor the yellow,\" said one of 'em. They who expressed an\nopinion at all hoped that their husbands would vote for him, \"as 'd\ndo most for 'em.\" \"The big loaf;--that's what we want,\" said one\nmother of many children, taking Sir Thomas by the hand. There were\nsome who took advantage of the occasion to pour out their tales of\ndaily griefs into the ears of their visitors. To these Griffenbottom\nwas rather short and hard. \"What we want, my dear, is your husband's\nvote and interest. We'll hear all the rest another time.\" Sir Thomas\nwould have lingered and listened; but Griffenbottom knew that 1,400\nvoters had to be visited in ten days, and work as they would they\ncould not see 140 a day. Trigger explained it all to Sir Thomas. \"You\ncan't work above seven hours, and you can't do twenty an hour. And\nmuch of the ground you must do twice over. If you stay to talk to\nthem you might as well be in London. Mr. Griffenbottom understands it\nso well, you'd better keep your eye on him.\" There could be no object\nin the world on which Sir Thomas was less desirous of keeping his\neye.\n\n\n[Illustration: \"The big loaf;--that's what we want,\" said one\nmother of many children, taking Sir Thomas by the hand.]\n\n\nThe men, who were much more difficult to find than the women, had\ngenerally less to say for themselves. Most of them understood at once\nwhat was wanted, and promised. For it must be understood that on this\ntheir first day the conservative brigade was moving among its firm\nfriends. In Petticoat Yard lived paper-makers in the employment of\nMr. Spiveycomb, and in Pump Lane the majority of the inhabitants were\nemployed by Mr. Spicer, of the mustard works. The manufactories of\nboth these men were visited, and there the voters were booked much\nquicker than at the rate of twenty an hour. Here and there a man\nwould hold some peculiar opinion of his own. The Permissive Bill was\nasked for by an energetic teetotaller; and others, even in these\nTory quarters, suggested the ballot. But they all,--or nearly all\nof them,--promised their votes. Now and again some sturdy fellow,\nseeming to be half ashamed of himself in opposing all those around\nhim, would say shortly that he meant to vote for Moggs, and pass on.\n\"You do,--do you?\" Sir Thomas heard Mr. Spicer say to one such man.\n\"Yes, I does,\" said the man. Sir Thomas heard no more, but he felt\nhow perilous was the position on which a candidate stood under the\npresent law.\n\nAs regarded Sir Thomas himself, he felt, as the evening was coming\non, that he had hardly done his share of the work. Mr. Griffenbottom\nhad canvassed, and he had walked behind. Every now and then he had\nattempted a little conversation, but in that he had been immediately\npulled up by the conscientious and energetic Mr. Trigger. As for\nasking for votes, he hardly knew, when he had been carried back\ninto the main street through a labyrinth of alleys at the back of\nPetticoat Yard, whether he had asked any man for his vote or not.\nWith the booking of the votes he had, of course, nothing to do. There\nwere three men with books;--and three other men to open the doors,\nshow the way, and make suggestions on the expediency of going hither\nor thither. Sir Thomas would always have been last in the procession,\nhad there not been one silent, civil person, whose duty it seemed to\nbe to bring up the rear. If ever Sir Thomas lingered behind to speak\nto a poor woman, there was this silent, civil person lingering too.\nThe influence of the silent, civil person was so strong that Sir\nThomas could not linger much.\n\nAs they came into the main street they encountered the opposition\nparty, Mr. Westmacott, Ontario Moggs, and their supporters. \"I'll\nintroduce you,\" said Mr. Griffenbottom to his colleague. \"Come along.\nIt's the thing to do.\" Then they met in the middle of the way. Poor\nOntario was hanging behind, but holding up his head gallantly,\nand endeavouring to look as though he were equal to the occasion.\nGriffenbottom and Westmacott shook hands cordially, and complained\nwith mutual sighs that household suffrage had made the work a deal\nharder than ever. \"And I'm only a week up from the gout,\" said\nGriffenbottom. Then Sir Thomas and Westmacott were introduced, and at\nlast Ontario was brought forward. He bowed and attempted to make a\nlittle speech; but nobody in one army or in the other seemed to care\nmuch for poor Ontario. He knew that it was so, but that mattered\nlittle to him. If he were destined to represent Percycross in\nParliament, it must be by the free votes and unbiassed political\naspirations of the honest working men of the borough. So remembering\nhe stood aloof, stuck his hand into his breast, and held up his\nhead something higher than before. Though the candidates had thus\ngreeted each other at this chance meeting, the other parties in the\ncontending armies had exhibited no courtesies.\n\nThe weariness of Sir Thomas when this first day's canvass was over\nwas so great that he was tempted to go to bed and ask for a bowl of\ngruel. Nothing kept him from doing so but amazement at the courage\nand endurance of Mr. Griffenbottom. \"We could get at a few of\nthose chaps who were at the works, if we went out at eight,\" said\nGriffenbottom. Trigger suggested that Mr. Griffenbottom would be\nvery tired. Trigger himself was perhaps tired. \"Oh, tired,\" said\nGriffenbottom; \"a man has to be tired at this work.\" Sir Thomas\nperceived that Griffenbottom was at least ten years his senior,\nand that he was still almost lame from the gout. \"You'll be ready,\nUnderwood?\" said Griffenbottom. Sir Thomas felt himself bound to\nundertake whatever might be thought necessary. \"If we were at it\nday and night, it wouldn't be too much,\" said Griffenbottom, as he\nprepared to amuse himself with one of the poll-books till dinner\nshould be on the table. \"Didn't we see Jacob Pucky?\" asked the\nenergetic candidate, observing that the man's name wasn't marked. \"To\nbe sure we did. I was speaking to him myself. He was one of those\nwho didn't know till the day came. We know what that means; eh,\nHoneywood?\" Sir Thomas wasn't quite sure that he did know; but he\npresumed that it meant something dishonest. Again Mr. Trigger dined\nwith them, and as soon as ever their dinner was swallowed they were\nout again at their work, Sir Thomas being dragged from door to door,\nwhile Griffenbottom asked for the votes.\n\nAnd this was to last yet for ten days more!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI.\n\nMOGGS, PURITY, AND THE RIGHTS OF LABOUR.\n\n\nMr. Trigger had hinted that Ontario Moggs would be a thorn in the\nflesh of Mr. Westmacott's supporters at Percycross, and he had\nbeen right. Ontario was timid, hesitating, and not unfrequently\nbrow-beaten in the social part of his work at the election. Though he\nmade great struggles he could neither talk, nor walk, nor eat, nor\nsit, as though he were the equal of his colleague. But when they came\nto politics and political management, there was no holding him. He\nwould make speeches when speeches were not held to be desirable by\nhis committee, and he was loud upon topics as to which it was thought\nthat no allusion whatever should have been made. To talk about the\nballot had from the first been conceded to Moggs. Mr. Westmacott\nwas, indeed, opposed to the ballot; but it had been a matter\nof course that the candidate of the people should support that\nmeasure. The ballot would have been a safety-valve. But Moggs was so\ncross-grained, ill-conditioned, and uncontrollable that he would not\nlet the ballot suffice him. The ballot was almost nothing to him.\nStrikes and bribery were his great subjects; the beauty of the one\nand the ugliness of the other. The right of the labourer to combine\nwith his brother labourers to make his own terms for his labour, was\nthe great lesson he taught. The suicidal iniquity of the labourer\nin selling that political power which he should use to protect his\nlabour was the source of his burning indignation. That labour was the\nsalt of the earth he told the men of Percycross very often;--and he\ntold them as often that manliness and courage were necessary to make\nthat salt productive. Gradually the men of Percycross,--some said\nthat they were only the boys of Percycross,--clustered round him, and\nlearned to like to listen to him. They came to understand something\nof the character of the man who was almost too shame-faced to speak\nto them while he was being dragged round to their homes on his\ncanvas, but whom nothing could repress when he was on his legs with\na crowd before him. It was in vain that the managing agent told him\nthat he would not get a vote by his spouting and shouting. On such\noccasions he hardly answered a word to the managing agent. But the\nspouting and shouting went on just the same, and was certainly\npopular among the bootmakers and tanners. Mr. Westmacott was asked\nto interfere, and did do so once in some mild fashion; but Ontario\nreplied that having been called to this sphere of action he could\nonly do his duty according to his own lights. The young men's\npresidents, and secretaries, and chairmen were for awhile somewhat\nfrightened, having been assured by the managing men of the liberal\ncommittee that the election would be lost by the furious insanity of\ntheir candidate. But they decided upon supporting Moggs, having found\nthat they would be deposed from their seats if they discarded him. At\nlast, when the futile efforts to control Moggs had been maintained\nwith patience for something over a week, when it still wanted four or\nfive days to the election, an actual split was made in the liberal\ncamp. Moggs was turned adrift by the Westmacottian faction. Bills\nwere placarded about the town explaining the cruel necessity for such\naction, and describing Moggs as a revolutionary firebrand. And now\nthere were three parties in the town. Mr. Trigger rejoiced over this\ngreatly with Mr. Griffenbottom. \"If they haven't been and cut their\nthroats now it is a wonder,\" he said over and over again. Even Sir\nThomas caught something of the feeling of triumph, and began almost\nto hope that he might be successful. Nevertheless the number of men\nwho could not quite make up their minds as to what duty required of\nthem till the day of the election was considerable, and Mr. Pile\ntriumphantly whispered into Mr. Trigger's ear his conviction that\n\"after all, things weren't going to be changed at Percycross quite so\neasily as some people supposed.\"\n\nWhen Moggs was utterly discarded by the respectable leaders of the\nliberal party in the borough,--turned out of the liberal inn at\nwhich were the head-quarters of the party, and refused the right\nof participating in the liberal breakfasts and dinners which were\nthere provided, Moggs felt himself to be a triumphant martyr. His\nportmanteau and hat-box were carried by an admiring throng down to\nthe Cordwainers' Arms,--a house not, indeed, of the highest repute in\nthe town,--and here a separate committee was formed. Mr. Westmacott\ndid his best to avert the secession; but his supporters were\ninexorable. The liberal tradesmen of Percycross would have nothing to\ndo with a candidate who declared that inasmuch as a man's mind was\nmore worthy than a man's money, labour was more worthy than capital,\nand that therefore the men should dominate and rule their masters.\nThat was a doctrine necessarily abominable to every master tradesman.\nThe men were to decide how many hours they would work, what\nrecreation they would have, in what fashion and at what rate they\nwould be paid, and what proportion of profit should be allowed to the\nmembers, and masters, and creators of the firm! That was the doctrine\nthat Moggs was preaching. The tradesmen of Percycross, whether\nliberal or conservative, did not understand much in the world of\npolitics, but they did understand that such a doctrine as that, if\ncarried out, would take them to a very Gehenna of revolutionary\ndesolation. And so Moggs was banished from the Northern Star, the\ninn at which Mr. Westmacott was living, and was forced to set up his\nradical staff at the Cordwainers' Arms.\n\nIn one respect he certainly gained much by this persecution. The\nrecord of his election doings would have been confined to the columns\nof the \"Percycross Herald\" had he carried on his candidature after\nthe usual fashion; but, as it was now, his doings were blazoned in\nthe London newspapers. The \"Daily News\" reported him, and gave him an\narticle all to himself; and even the \"Times\" condescended to make an\nexample of him, and to bring him up as evidence that revolutionary\ndoctrines were distasteful to the electors of the country generally.\nThe fame of Ontario Moggs certainly became more familiar to the ears\nof the world at large than it would have done had he continued to run\nin a pair with Mr. Westmacott. And that was everything to him. Polly\nNeefit must hear of him now that his name had become a household word\nin the London newspapers.\n\nAnd in another respect he gained much. All personal canvassing was\nnow at an end for him. There could be no use in his going about from\nhouse to house asking for votes. Indeed, he had discovered that to do\nso was a thing iniquitous in itself, a demoralising practice tending\nto falsehood, intimidation, and corruption,--a thing to be denounced.\nAnd he denounced it. Let the men of Percycross hear him, question him\nin public, learn from his spoken words what were his political\nprinciples,--and then vote for him if they pleased. He would\ncondescend to ask a vote as a favour from no man. It was for them\nrather to ask him to bestow upon them the gift of his time and such\nability as he possessed. He took a very high tone indeed in his\nspeeches, and was saved the labour of parading the streets. During\nthese days he looked down from an immeasurable height on the\ntruckling, mean, sordid doings of Griffenbottom, Underwood, and\nWestmacott. A huge board had been hoisted up over the somewhat low\nfrontage of the Cordwainers' Arms, and on this was painted in letters\ntwo feet high a legend which it delighted him to read, MOGGS, PURITY,\nAND THE RIGHTS OF LABOUR. Ah, if that could only be understood, there\nwas enough in it to bring back an age of gold to suffering humanity!\nNo other Reform would be needed. In that short legend everything\nnecessary for man was contained.\n\nMr. Pile and Mr. Trigger stood together one evening looking at the\nlegend from a distance. \"Moggs and purity!\" said Mr. Pile, in that\ntone of disgust, and with that peculiar action which had become\ncommon to him in speaking of this election.\n\n\"He hasn't a ghost of a chance,\" said Mr. Trigger, who was always\nlooking straight at the main point;--\"nor yet hasn't Westmacott.\"\n\n\"There's worse than Westmacott,\" said Mr. Pile.\n\n\"But what can we do?\" said Trigger.\n\n\"Purity! Purity!\" said the old man. \"It makes me that sick that I\nwish there weren't such a thing as a member of Parliament. Purity and\npickpockets is about the same. When I'm among 'em I buttons up my\nbreeches-pockets.\"\n\n\"But what can we do?\" asked Mr. Trigger again, in a voice of woe. Mr.\nTrigger quite sympathised with his elder friend; but, being a younger\nman, he knew that these innovations must be endured.\n\nThen Mr. Pile made a speech, of such length that he had never been\nknown to make the like before;--so that Mr. Trigger felt that things\nhad become very serious, and that, not impossibly, Mr. Pile might be\nso affected by this election as never again to hold up his head in\nPercycross. \"Purity! Purity!\" he repeated. \"They're a going on that\nway, Trigger, that the country soon won't be fit for a man to live\nin. And what's the meaning of it all? It's just this,--that folks\nwants what they wants without paying for it. I hate Purity, I do. I\nhate the very smell of it. It stinks. When I see the chaps as come\nhere and talk of Purity, I know they mean that nothing ain't to be as\nit used to be. Nobody is to trust no one. There ain't to be nothing\nwarm, nor friendly, nor comfortable any more. This Sir Thomas you've\nbrought down is just as bad as that shoemaking chap;--worse if\nanything. I know what's a going on inside him. I can see it. If a man\ntakes a glass of wine out of his bottle, he's a asking hisself if\nthat ain't bribery and corruption! He's got a handle to his name, and\nmoney, I suppose, and comes down here without knowing a chick or a\nchild. Why isn't a poor man, as can't hardly live, to have his three\nhalf-crowns or fifteen shillings, as things may go, for voting for a\nstranger such as him? I'll tell you what it is, Trigger, I've done\nwith it. Things have come to that in the borough, that I'll meddle\nand make no more.\" Mr. Trigger, as he listened to this eloquence,\ncould only sigh and shake his head. \"I did think it would last my\ntime,\" added Mr. Pile, almost weeping.\n\nMoggs would steal out of the house in the early morning, look up at\nthe big bright red letters, and rejoice in his very heart of hearts.\nHe had not lived in vain, when his name had been joined, in the\npublic view of men, with words so glorious. Purity and the Rights of\nLabour! \"It contains just everything,\" said Moggs to himself as he\nsat down to his modest, lonely breakfast. After that, sitting with\nhis hands clasped upon his brow, disdaining the use of pen and paper\nfor such work, he composed his speech for the evening,--a speech\nframed with the purpose of proving to his hearers that Purity and the\nRights of Labour combined would make them as angels upon the earth.\nAs for himself, Moggs, he explained in his speech,--analysing the big\nboard which adorned the house,--it mattered little whether they did\nor did not return him. But let them be always persistent in returning\non every possible occasion Purity and the Rights of Labour, and then\nall other good things would follow to them. He enjoyed at any rate\nthat supreme delight which a man feels when he thoroughly believes\nhis own doctrine.\n\nBut the days were very long with him. When the evening came, when his\nfriends were relieved from their toil, and could assemble here and\nthere through the borough to hear him preach to them, he was happy\nenough. He had certainly achieved so much that they preferred him now\nto their own presidents and chairmen. There was an enthusiasm for\nMoggs among the labouring men of Percycross, and he was always happy\nwhile he was addressing them. But the hours in the morning were\nlong, and sometimes melancholy. Though all the town was busy with\nthese electioneering doings, there was nothing for him to do. His\nrivals canvassed, consulted, roamed through the town,--as he could\nsee,--filching votes from him. But he, too noble for such work\nas that, sat there alone in the little upstairs parlour of the\nCordwainers' Arms, thinking of his speech for the evening,--thinking,\ntoo, of Polly Neefit. And then, of a sudden, it occurred to him that\nit would be good to write a letter to Polly from Percycross. Surely\nthe fact that he was waging this grand battle would have some effect\nupon her heart. So he wrote the following letter, which reached Polly\nabout a week after her return home from Margate.\n\n\n   Cordwainers' Arms Inn, Percycross,\n   14 October, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR POLLY,--\n\n   I hope you won't be angry with me for writing to you. I am\n   here in the midst of the turmoil of a contested election,\n   and I cannot refrain from writing to tell you about it.\n   Out of a full heart they say the mouth speaks, and out of\n   a very full heart I am speaking to you with my pen. The\n   honourable prospect of having a seat in the British House\n   of Parliament, which I regard as the highest dignity that\n   a Briton can enjoy, is very much to me, and fills my mind,\n   and my heart, and my soul; but it all is not so much to me\n   as your love, if only I could win that seat. If I could\n   sit there, in your heart, and be chosen by you, not for a\n   short seven years, but for life, I should be prouder and\n   happier of that honour than of any other. It ought not,\n   perhaps, to be so, but it is. I have to speak here to\n   the people very often; but I never open my mouth without\n   thinking that if I had you to hear me I could speak with\n   more energy and spirit. If I could gain your love and the\n   seat for this borough together, I should have done more\n   then than emperor, or conqueror, or high priest ever\n   accomplished.\n\n   I don't know whether you understand much about elections.\n   When I first came here I was joined with a gentleman\n   who was one of the old members;--but now I stand alone,\n   because he does not comprehend or sympathise with the\n   advanced doctrines which it is my mission to preach to the\n   people. Purity and the Rights of Labour;--those are my\n   watchwords. But there are many here who hate the very name\n   of Purity, and who know nothing of the Rights of Labour.\n   Labour, dear Polly, is the salt of the earth; and I hope\n   that some day I may have the privilege of teaching you\n   that it is so. For myself I do not see why ladies should\n   not understand politics as well as men; and I think that\n   they ought to vote. I hope you think that women ought to\n   have the franchise.\n\n   We are to be nominated on Monday, and the election will\n   take place on Tuesday. I shall be nominated and seconded\n   by two electors who are working men. I would sooner\n   have their support than that of the greatest magnate in\n   the land. But your support would be better for me than\n   anything else in the world. People here, as a rule, are\n   very lukewarm about the ballot, and they seemed to know\n   very little about strikes till I came among them. Without\n   combination and mutual support the working people must be\n   ground to powder. If I am sent to Parliament I shall feel\n   it to be my duty to insist upon this doctrine in season\n   and out of season,--whenever I can make my voice heard.\n   But, oh Polly, if I could do it with you for my wife, my\n   voice would be so much louder.\n\n   Pray give my best respects to your father and mother. I am\n   afraid I have not your father's good wishes, but perhaps\n   if he saw me filling the honourable position of member of\n   Parliament for Percycross he might relent. If you would\n   condescend to write me one word in reply I should be\n   prouder of that than of anything. I suppose I shall be\n   here till Wednesday morning. If you would say but one kind\n   word to me, I think that it would help me on the great\n   day.\n\n   I am, and ever shall be,\n   Your most affectionate admirer,\n\n   ONTARIO MOGGS.\n\n\n[Illustration: \"Out of a full heart they say the mouth speaks,\nand out of a very full heart I am speaking to you with my pen.\"]\n\n\nPolly received this on the Monday, the day of the nomination, and\nthough she did answer it at once, Ontario did not get her reply till\nthe contest was over, and that great day had done its best and its\nworst for him. But Polly's letter shall be given here. To a well-bred\nyoung lady, living in good society, the mixture of politics and\nlove which had filled Ontario's epistle might perhaps have been\nunacceptable. But Polly thought that the letter was a good letter;\nand was proud of being so noticed by a young man who was standing for\nParliament. She sympathised with his enthusiasm; and thought that\nshe should like to be taught by him that Labour was the Salt of the\nEarth,--if only he were not so awkward and long, and if his hands\nwere habitually a little cleaner. She could not, however, take\nupon herself to give him any hope in that direction, and therefore\nconfined her answer to the Parliamentary prospects of the hour.\n\n\n   DEAR MR. MOGGS,--[she wrote]--I was very much pleased\n   when I heard that you were going to stand for a member of\n   Parliament, and I wish with all my heart that you may be\n   successful. I shall think it a very great honour indeed\n   to know a member of Parliament, as I have known you for\n   nearly all my life. I am sure you will do a great deal of\n   good, and prevent the people from being wicked. As for\n   ladies voting, I don't think I should like that myself,\n   though if I had twenty votes I would give them to\n   you,--because I have known you so long.\n\n   Father and mother send their respects, and hope you will\n   be successful.\n\n   Yours truly,\n\n   MARYANNE NEEFIT.\n\n   Alexandra Cottage, Monday.\n\n\nWhen Moggs received this letter he was, not unnaturally, in a state\nof great agitation in reference to the contest through which he had\njust passed; but still he thought very much of it, and put it in his\nbreast, where it would lie near his heart. Ah, if only one word of\nwarmth had been allowed to escape from the writer, how happy could he\nhave been. \"Yes,\" he said scornfully,--\"because she has known me all\nher life!\" Nevertheless, the paper which her hand had pressed, and\nthe letters which her fingers had formed, were placed close to his\nheart.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII.\n\nTHE MOONBEAM.\n\n\nRalph the heir had given his answer, and the thing was settled. He\nhad abandoned his property for ever, and was to be put into immediate\npossession of a large sum of money,--of a sum so large that it would\nseem at once to make him a rich man. He knew, however, that if he\nshould spend this money he would be a pauper for life; and he knew\nalso how great was his facility for spending. There might, however,\nbe at least a thousand a year for him and for his heirs after him,\nand surely it ought to be easy for him to live upon a thousand a\nyear.\n\nAs he thought of this he tried to make the best of it. He had at\nany rate rescued himself out of the hands of Neefit, who had become\nintolerable to him. As for Polly, she had refused him twice. Polly\nwas a very sweet girl, but he could not make it matter of regret to\nhimself that he should have lost Polly. Had Polly been all alone in\nthe world she would have been well enough,--but Polly with papa and\nmamma Neefit must have been a mistake. It was well for him, at any\nrate, that he was out of that trouble. As regarded the Neefits, it\nwould be simply necessary that he should pay the breeches-maker the\nmoney that he owed them, and go no more either to Conduit Street or\nto Hendon.\n\nAnd then what else should he do,--or leave undone? In what other\ndirection should he be active or inactive? He was well aware\nthat hitherto he had utterly wasted his life. Born with glorious\nprospects, he had now so dissipated them that there was nothing left\nfor him but a quiet and very unambitious mode of life. Of means he\nhad sufficient, if only he could keep that sufficiency. But he knew\nhimself,--he feared that he knew himself too well to trust himself\nto keep that which he had unless he altogether changed his manner of\nliving. To be a hybrid at the Moonbeam for life,--half hero and half\ndupe, among grooms and stable-keepers, was not satisfactory to him.\nHe could see and could appreciate better things, and could long for\nthem; but he could not attain to anything better unless he were to\nalter altogether his mode of life. Would it not be well for him to\nget a wife? He was rid of Polly, who had been an incubus to him, and\nnow he could choose for himself.\n\nHe wrote to his brother Gregory, telling his brother what he had\ndone. The writing of letters was ever a trouble to him, and on this\noccasion he told his tidings in a line or two. \"Dear Greg., I have\naccepted my uncle's offer. It was better so. When I wrote to you\nbefore things were different. I need not tell you that my heart is\nsore for the old place. Had I stuck to it, however, I should have\nbeggared you and disgraced myself. Yours affectionately, R. N.\" That\nwas all. What more was to be said which, in the saying, could be\nserviceable to any one? The dear old place! He would never see it\nagain. Nothing on earth should induce him to go there, now that it\ncould under no circumstances be his own. It would still belong to a\nNewton, and he would try and take comfort in that. He might at any\nrate have done worse with it. He might have squandered his interest\namong the Jews, and so have treated his inheritance that it must have\nbeen sold among strangers.\n\nHe was very low in spirits for two or three days, thinking of all\nthis. He had been with his lawyer, and his lawyer had told him that\nit must yet be some weeks before the sale would be perfected. \"Now\nthat it is done, the sooner the better,\" said Ralph. The lawyer told\nhim that if he absolutely wanted ready money for his present needs\nhe could have it; but that otherwise it would be better for him to\nwait patiently,--say for a month. He was not absolutely in want of\nmoney, having still funds which had been supplied to him by the\nbreeches-maker. But he could not remain in town. Were he to remain in\ntown, Neefit would be upon him; and, in truth, though he was quite\nclear in his conscience in regard to Polly, he did not wish to have\nto explain personally to Mr. Neefit that he had sold his interest in\nNewton Priory. The moment the money was in his hands he would pay Mr.\nNeefit; and then--; why then he thought that he would be entitled\nto have Mr. Neefit told that he was not at home should Mr. Neefit\ntrouble him again.\n\nHe would marry and live somewhere very quietly;--perhaps take a small\nfarm and keep one hunter. His means would be sufficient for that,\neven with a wife and family. Yes;--that would be the kind of life\nmost suited for him. He would make a great change. He would be simple\nin his habits, domestic, and extravagant in nothing. To hunt once\na week from his own little country house would be delightful. Who\nshould be the mistress of that home? That of all questions was now\nthe most important.\n\nThe reader may remember a certain trifling incident which took place\nsome three or four months since on the lawn at Popham Villa. It was\nan incident which Clary Underwood had certainly never forgotten. It\nis hardly too much to say that she thought of it every hour. She\nthought of it as a great sin;--but as a sin which had been forgiven,\nand, though a grievous sin, as strong evidence of that which was\nnot sinful, and which if true would be so full of joy. Clary had\nnever forgotten this incident;--but Ralph had forgotten it nearly\naltogether. That he had accompanied the incident by any assurance of\nhis love, by any mention of love intended to mean anything, he was\naltogether unaware. He would have been ready to swear that he had\nnever so committed himself. Little tender passages of course there\nhad been. Such are common,--so he thought,--when young ladies and\nyoung gentlemen know each other well and are fond of each other's\ncompany. But that he owed himself to Clarissa Underwood, and that he\nwould sin grievously against her should he give himself to another,\nhe had no idea. It merely occurred to him that there might be some\nslight preparatory embarrassment were he to offer his hand to Mary\nBonner. Yet he thought that of all the girls in the world Mary Bonner\nwas the one to whom he would best like to offer it. It might indeed\nbe possible for him to marry some young woman with money; but in his\npresent frame of mind he was opposed to any such effort. Hitherto\nthings with him had been all worldly, empty, useless, and at the same\ntime distasteful. He was to have married Polly Neefit for her money,\nand he had been wretched ever since he had entertained the idea. Love\nand a cottage were, he knew, things incompatible; but the love and\nthe cottage implied in those words were synonymous with absolute\npoverty. Love with thirty thousand pounds, even though it should have\na cottage joined with it, need not be a poverty-stricken love. He was\nsick of the world,--of the world such as he had made it for himself,\nand he would see if he could not do something better. He would first\nget Mary Bonner, and then he would get the farm. He was so much\ndelighted with the scheme which he thus made for himself, that he\nwent to his club and dined there pleasantly, allowing himself a\nbottle of champagne as a sort of reward for having made up his mind\nto so much virtue. He met a friend or two, and spent a pleasant\nevening, and as he walked home to his lodgings in the evening was\nquite in love with his prospects. It was well for him to have rid\nhimself of the burden of an inheritance which might perhaps not have\nbeen his for the next five-and-twenty years. As he undressed himself\nhe considered whether it would be well for him at once to throw\nhimself at Mary Bonner's feet. There were two reasons for not doing\nthis quite immediately. He had been told by his lawyer that he ought\nto wait for some form of assent or agreement from the Squire before\nhe took any important step as consequent upon the new arrangement\nin regard to the property, and then Sir Thomas was still among the\nelectors at Percycross. He wished to do everything that was proper,\nand would wait for the return of Sir Thomas. But he must do something\nat once. To remain in his lodgings and at his club was not in accord\nwith that better path in life which he had chalked out for himself.\n\nOf course he must go down to the Moonbeam. He had four horses there,\nand must sell at least three of them. One hunter he intended to allow\nhimself. There were Brag, Banker, Buff, and Brewer; and he thought\nthat he would keep Brag. Brag was only six years old, and might last\nhim for the next seven years. In the meantime he could see a little\ncub-hunting, and live at the Moonbeam for a week at any rate as\ncheaply as he could in London. So he went down to the Moonbeam, and\nput himself under the charge of Mr. Horsball.\n\nAnd here he found himself in luck. Lieutenant Cox was there, and with\nthe lieutenant a certain Fred Pepper, who hunted habitually with the\nB. and B. Lieutenant Cox had soon told his little tale. He had sold\nout, and had promised his family that he would go to Australia. But\nhe intended to \"take one more winter out of himself,\" as he phrased\nit. He had made a bargain to that effect with his governor. His debts\nhad been paid, his commission had been sold, and he was to be shipped\nfor Queensland. But he was to have one more winter with the B. and B.\nAn open, good-humoured, shrewd youth was Lieutenant Cox, who suffered\nnothing from false shame, and was intelligent enough to know that\nlife at the rate of \u00c2\u00a31,200 a year, with \u00c2\u00a3400 to spend, must come to\nan end. Fred Pepper was a young man of about forty-five, who had\nhunted with the B. and B., and lived at the Moonbeam from a time\nbeyond which the memory of Mr. Horsball's present customers went not.\nHe was the father of the Moonbeam, Mr. Horsball himself having come\nthere since the days in which Fred Pepper first became familiar with\nits loose boxes. No one knew how he lived or how he got his horses.\nHe had, however, a very pretty knack of selling them, and certainly\npaid Mr. Horsball regularly. He was wont to vanish in April, and\nwould always turn up again in October. Some people called him the\ndormouse. He was good-humoured, good-looking after a horsey fashion,\nclever, agreeable, and quite willing to submit himself to any\nnickname that could be found for him. He liked a rubber of whist, and\nwas supposed to make something out of bets with bad players. He rode\nvery carefully, and was altogether averse to ostentation and bluster\nin the field. But he could make a horse do anything when he wanted\nto sell him, and could on an occasion give a lead as well as any man.\nEverybody liked him, and various things were constantly said in his\npraise. He was never known to borrow a sovereign. He had been known\nto lend a horse. He did not drink. He was a very safe man in the\nfield. He did not lie outrageously in selling his horses. He did not\ncheat at cards. As long as he had a drop of drink left in his flask,\nhe would share it with any friend. He never boasted. He was much\ngiven to chaff, but his chaff was good-humoured. He was generous with\nhis cigars. Such were his virtues. That he had no adequate means of\nhis own and that he never earned a penny, that he lived chiefly by\ngambling, that he had no pursuit in life but pleasure, that he never\nwent inside a church, that he never gave away a shilling, that he was\nof no use to any human being, and that no one could believe a word he\nsaid of himself,--these were specks upon his character. Taken as a\nwhole Fred Pepper was certainly very popular with the gentlemen and\nladies of the B. and B.\n\nRalph Newton when he dropped down upon the Moonbeam was made loudly\nwelcome. Mr. Horsball, whose bill for \u00c2\u00a3500 had been honoured at its\nfirst day of maturity, not a little, perhaps, to his own surprise,\ntreated Ralph almost as a hero. When Ralph made some reference to the\nremainder of the money due, Mr. Horsball expressed himself as quite\nshocked at the allusion. He had really had the greatest regret in\nasking Mr. Newton for his note of hand, and would not have done it,\nhad not an unforeseen circumstance called upon him suddenly to make\nup a few thousands. He had felt very much obliged to Mr. Newton for\nhis prompt kindness. There needn't be a word about the remainder,\nand if Mr. Newton wanted something specially good for the next\nseason,--as of course he would,--Mr. Horsball had just the horse that\nwould suit him. \"You'll about want a couple more, Mr. Newton,\" said\nMr. Horsball.\n\nThen Ralph told something of his plans to this Master of the\nStuds,--something, but not much. He said nothing of the sale of his\nproperty, and nothing quite definite as to that one horse with which\nhis hunting was to be done for the future. \"I'm going to turn over a\nnew leaf, Horsball,\" he said.\n\n\"Not going to be spliced, squire?\"\n\n\"Well;--I can't say that I am, but I won't say that I ain't. But I'm\ncertainly going to make a change which will take me away from your\nfatherly care.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry for that, squire. We think we've always taken great care\nof you here.\"\n\n\"The very best in the world;--but a man must settle down in the world\nsome day, you know. I want a nice bit of land, a hundred and fifty\nacres, or something of that sort.\"\n\n\"To purchase, squire?\"\n\n\"I don't care whether I buy it or take it on lease. But it mustn't be\nin this county. I am too well known here, and should always want to\nbe out when I ought to be looking after the stock.\"\n\n\"You'll take the season out of yourself first, at any rate,\" said Mr.\nHorsball. Ralph shook his head, but Mr. Horsball felt nearly sure\nof his customer for the ensuing winter. It is not easy for a man to\npart with four horses, seven or eight saddles, an establishment of\nbridles, horsesheets, spurs, rollers, and bandages, a pet groom,\na roomful of top boots, and leather breeches beyond the power of\ncounting. This is a wealth which it is easy to increase, but of which\nit is very difficult to get quit.\n\n\"I think I shall sell,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"We'll talk about that in April,\" said Mr. Horsball.\n\nHe went out cub-hunting three or four times, and spent the\nintermediate days playing dummy whist with Fred Pepper and Cox,--who\nwas no longer a lieutenant. Ralph felt that this was not the sort of\nbeginning for his better life which would have been most appropriate;\nbut then he hardly had an opportunity of beginning that better life\nquite at once. He must wait till something more definite had been\ndone about the property,--and, above all things, till Sir Thomas\nshould be back from canvassing. He did, however, so far begin\nhis better life as to declare that the points at whist must be\nlow,--shilling points, with half-a-crown on the rubber. \"Quite\nenough for this kind of thing,\" said Fred Pepper. \"We only want just\nsomething to do.\" And Ralph, when at the end of the week he had lost\nonly a matter of fifteen pounds, congratulated himself on having\nbegun his better life. Cox and Fred Pepper, who divided the trifle\nbetween them, laughed at the bagatelle.\n\nBut before he left the Moonbeam things had assumed a shape which,\nwhen looked at all round, was not altogether pleasant to him. Before\nhe had been three days at the place he received a letter from his\nlawyer, telling him that his uncle had given his formal assent to the\npurchase, and had offered to pay the stipulated sum as soon as Ralph\nwould be willing to receive it. As to any further sum that might be\nforthcoming, a valuer should be agreed upon at once. The actual deed\nof sale and transfer would be ready by the middle of November; and\nthe lawyer advised Ralph to postpone his acceptance of the money till\nthat deed should have been executed. It was evident from the letter\nthat there was no need on his part to hurry back to town. This letter\nhe found waiting for him on his return one day from hunting. There\nhad been a pretty run, very fast, with a kill, as there will be\nsometimes in cub-hunting in October,--though as a rule, of all\nsports, cub-hunting is the sorriest. Ralph had ridden his favourite\nhorse Brag, and Mr. Pepper had taken out,--just to try him,--a little\nanimal of his that he had bought, as he said, quite at haphazard. He\nknew nothing about him, and was rather afraid that he had been done.\nBut the little horse seemed to have a dash of pace about him, and in\nthe evening there was some talk of the animal. Fred Pepper thought\nthat the little horse was faster than Brag. Fred Pepper never praised\nhis own horses loudly; and when Brag's merits were chaunted, said\nthat perhaps Ralph was right. Would Ralph throw his leg over the\nlittle horse on Friday and try him? On the Friday Ralph did throw his\nleg over the little horse, and there was another burst. Ralph was\nobliged to confess, as they came home together in the afternoon, that\nhe had never been better carried. \"I can see what he is now,\" said\nFred Pepper;--\"he is one of those little horses that one don't get\nevery day. He's up to a stone over my weight, too.\" Now Ralph and\nFred Pepper each rode thirteen stone and a half.\n\nOn that day they dined together, and there was much talk as to the\nfuture prospects of the men. Not that Fred Pepper said anything of\nhis future prospects. No one ever presumed him to have a prospect, or\nsuggested to him to look for one. But Cox had been very communicative\nand confidential, and Ralph had been prompted to say something of\nhimself. Fred Pepper, though he had no future of his own, could\nhe pleasantly interested about the future of another, and had\nquite agreed with Ralph that he ought to settle himself. The only\ndifficulty was in deciding the when. Cox intended to settle himself\ntoo, but Cox was quite clear as to the wisdom of taking another\nseason out of himself. He was prepared to prove that it would be\nsheer waste of time and money not to do so. \"Here I am,\" said Cox,\n\"and a fellow always saves money by staying where he is.\" There was a\nsparkle of truth in this which Ralph Newton found himself unable to\ndeny.\n\n\"You'll never have another chance,\" said Pepper.\n\n\"That's another thing,\" said Cox. \"Of course I shan't. I've turned it\nround every side, and I know what I'm about. As for horses, I believe\nthey sell better in April than they do in October. Men know what they\nare then.\" Fred Pepper would not exactly back this opinion, but he\nventured to suggest that there was not so much difference as some men\nsupposed.\n\n\"If you are to jump into the cold water,\" said Ralph, \"you'd better\ntake the plunge at once.\"\n\n\"I'd sooner do it in summer than winter,\" said Fred Pepper.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Cox. \"If you must give up hunting, do it at the end\nof the season, not at the beginning. There's a time for all things.\nRing the bell, Dormouse, and we'll have another bottle of claret\nbefore we go to dummy.\"\n\n\"If I stay here for the winter,\" said Ralph, \"I should want another\nhorse. Though I might, perhaps, get through with four.\"\n\n\"Of course you might,\" said Pepper, who never spoilt his own market\nby pressing.\n\n\"I'd rather give up altogether than do it in a scratch way,\" said\nRalph. \"I've got into a fashion of having a second horse, and I like\nit.\"\n\n\"It's the greatest luxury in the world,\" said Cox.\n\n\"I never tried it,\" said Pepper; \"I'm only too happy to get one.\" It\nwas admitted by all men that Fred Pepper had the art of riding his\nhorses without tiring them.\n\nThey played their rubber of whist and had a little hot whisky and\nwater. On this evening Mr. Horsball was admitted to their company and\nmade a fourth. But he wouldn't bet. Shilling points, he said, were\nquite as much as he could afford. Through the whole evening they went\non talking of the next season, of the absolute folly of giving up one\nthing before another was begun, and of the merits of Fred Pepper's\nlittle horse. \"A clever little animal, Mr. Pepper,\" said the great\nman, \"a very clever little animal; but I wish you wouldn't bring so\nmany clever un's down here, Mr. Pepper.\"\n\n\"Why not, Horsball?\" asked Cox.\n\n\"Because he interferes with my trade,\" said Mr. Horsball, laughing.\nIt was supposed, nevertheless, that Mr. Horsball and Mr. Pepper quite\nunderstood each other. Before the evening was over, a price had been\nfixed, and Ralph had bought the little horse for \u00c2\u00a3130. Why shouldn't\nhe take another winter out of himself? He could not marry Mary Bonner\nand get into a farm all in a day,--nor yet all in a month. He would\ngo to work honestly with the view of settling himself; but let him\nbe as honest about it as he might, his winter's hunting would not\ninterfere with him. So at last he assured himself. And then he had\nanother argument strong in his favour. He might hunt all the winter\nand yet have this thirty thousand pounds,--nay, more than thirty\nthousand pounds at the end of it. In fact, imprudent and foolish as\nhad been his hunting in all previous winters, there would not even\nbe any imprudence in this winter's hunting. Fortified by all these\nunanswerable arguments he did buy Mr. Fred Pepper's little horse.\n\nOn the next morning, the morning of the day on which he was to return\nto town, the arguments did not seem to be so irresistible, and he\nalmost regretted what he had done. It was not that he would be ruined\nby another six months' fling at life. Situated as he now was so much\nmight be allowed to him almost without injury. But then how can a man\ntrust in his own resolutions before he has begun to keep them,--when,\nat the very moment of beginning, he throws them to the winds for the\npresent, postponing everything for another hour? He knew as well as\nany one could tell him that he was proving himself to be unfit for\nthat new life which he was proposing to himself. When one man is\nwise and another foolish, the foolish man knows generally as well\nas does the wise man in what lies wisdom and in what folly. And the\ntemptation often is very slight. Ralph Newton had hardly wished to\nbuy Mr. Pepper's little horse. The balance of desire during the whole\nevening had lain altogether on the other side. But there had come\na moment in which he had yielded, and that moment governed all the\nother minutes. We may almost say that a man is only as strong as his\nweakest moment.\n\nBut he returned to London very strong in his purpose. He would keep\nhis establishment at the Moonbeam for this winter. He had it all laid\nout and planned in his mind. He would at once pay Mr. Horsball the\nbalance of the old debt, and count on the value of his horses to\ndefray the expense of the coming season. And he would, without a\nweek's delay, make his offer to Mary Bonner. A dim idea of some\nfeeling of disappointment on Clary's part did cross his brain,--a\nfeeling which seemed to threaten some slight discomfort to himself\nas resulting from want of sympathy on her part; but he must assume\nsufficient courage to brave this. That he would in any degree be an\nevil-doer towards Clary,--that did not occur to him. Nor did it occur\nto him as at all probable that Mary Bonner would refuse his offer. In\nthese days men never expect to be refused. It has gone forth among\nyoung men as a doctrine worthy of perfect faith, that young ladies\nare all wanting to get married,--looking out for lovers with an\nabsorbing anxiety, and that few can dare to refuse any man who is\njustified in proposing to them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nTHE NEW HEIR COUNTS HIS CHICKENS.\n\n\nThe Squire was almost lost in joy when he received his son's letter,\ntelling him that Ralph the heir had consented to sell everything.\nThe one great wish of his life was to be accomplished at last! The\nproperty was to be his own, so that he might do what he liked with\nit, so that he might leave it entire to his own son, so that for the\nremainder of his life he might enjoy it in that community with his\nson which had always appeared to him to be the very summit of human\nbliss. From the sweet things which he had seen he had been hitherto\ncut off by the record of his own fault, and had spent the greater\npart of his life in the endurance of a bitter punishment. He had been\ntorn to pieces, too, in contemplating the modes of escape from the\nposition in which his father's very natural will had placed him. He\nmight of course have married, and at least have expected and have\nhoped for children. But in that there would have been misery. His\nson was the one human being that was dear to him above all others,\nand by such a marriage he would have ruined his son. Early in life,\ncomparatively early, he had made up his mind that he would not do\nthat;--that he would save his money, and make a property for the boy\nhe loved. But then it had come home to him as a fact, that he could\nbe happy in preparing no other home for his son than this old family\nhouse of his, with all its acres, woods, and homesteads. The acres,\nwoods, and homesteads gave to him no delight, feeling as he did every\nhour of his life that they were not his own for purposes of a real\nusufruct. Then by degrees he had heard of his nephew's follies, and\nthe idea had come upon him that he might buy his nephew out. Ralph,\nhis own Ralph, had told him that the idea was cruel; but he could not\nsee the cruelty. \"What a bad man loses a good man will get,\" he said;\n\"and surely it must be better for all those who are to live by the\nproperty that a good man should be the master of it.\" He would not\ninterfere, nor would he have any power of interfering, till others\nwould interfere were he to keep aloof. The doings would be the doings\nof that spendthrift heir, and none of his. When Ralph would tell him\nthat he was cruel, he would turn away in wrath; but hiding his wrath,\nbecause he loved his son. But now everything was set right, and his\nson had had the doing of it.\n\nHe was nearly mad with joy throughout that day as he thought of the\ngreat thing which he had accomplished. He was alone in the house, for\nhis son was still in London, and during the last few months guests\nhad been unfrequent at the Priory. But he did not wish to have\nanybody with him now. He went out, roaming through the park, and\nrealising to himself the fact that now, at length, the very trees\nwere his own. He gazed at one farmhouse after another, not seeking\nthe tenants, hardly speaking to them if he met them, but with his\nbrain full of plans of what should be done. He saw Gregory for a\nmoment, but only nodded at him smiling, and passed on. He was not in\na humour just at present to tell his happiness to any one. He walked\nall round Darvell's premises, the desolate, half-ruined house of\nBrumbys, telling himself that very shortly it should be desolate and\nhalf-ruined no longer. Then he crossed into the lane, and stood with\nhis eyes fixed upon Brownriggs,--Walker's farm, the pearl of all the\nfarms in those parts, the land with which he thought he could have\nparted so easily when the question before him was that of becoming in\ntruth the owner of any portion of the estate. But now, every acre was\nten times dearer to him than it had been then. He would never part\nwith Brownriggs. He would even save Ingram's farm, in Twining, if\nit might possibly be saved. He had not known before how dear to him\ncould be every bank, every tree, every sod. Yes;--now in very truth\nhe was lord and master of the property which had belonged to his\nfather, and his father's fathers before him. He would borrow money,\nand save it during his lifetime. He would do anything rather than\npart with an acre of it, now that the acres were his own to leave\nbehind him to his son.\n\nOn the following day Ralph arrived. We must no longer call him Ralph\nwho was not the heir. He would be heir to everything from the day\nthat the contract was completed! The Squire, though he longed to see\nthe young man as he had never longed before, would not go to the\nstation to meet the welcome one. His irrepressible joy was too great\nto be exhibited before strangers. He remained at home, in his own\nroom, desiring that Mr. Ralph might come to him there. He would not\neven show himself in the hall. And yet when Ralph entered the room he\nwas very calm. There was a bright light in his eyes, but at first he\nspoke hardly a word. \"So, you've managed that little job,\" he said,\nas he took his son's hand.\n\n\"I managed nothing, sir,\" said Ralph, smiling.\n\n\"Didn't you? I thought you had managed a good deal. It is done,\nanyway.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir, it's done. At least, I suppose so.\" Ralph, after sending\nhis telegram, had of course written to his father, giving him full\nparticulars of the manner in which the arrangement had been made.\n\n\"You don't mean that there is any doubt,\" said the Squire with almost\nan anxious tone.\n\n\"Not at all, as far as I know. The lawyers seem to think that it is\nall right. Ralph is quite in earnest.\"\n\n\"He must be in earnest,\" said the Squire.\n\n\"He has behaved uncommonly well,\" said the namesake. \"So well that I\nthink you owe him much. We were quite mistaken in supposing that he\nwanted to drive a sharp bargain.\" He himself had never so supposed,\nbut he found this to be the best way of speaking of that matter to\nhis father.\n\n\"I will forgive him everything now,\" said the Squire, \"and will do\nanything that I can to help him.\"\n\nRalph said many things in praise of his namesake. He still almost\nregretted what had been done. At any rate he could see the pity\nof it. It was that other Ralph who should have been looked to as\nthe future proprietor of Newton Priory, and not he, who was hardly\nentitled to call himself a Newton. It would have been more consistent\nwith the English order of things that it should be so. And then\nthere was so much to say in favour of this young man who had lost\nit all, and so little to say against him! And it almost seemed to\nhim for whose sake the purchase was being made, that advantage,--an\nunscrupulous if not an unfair advantage,--was being taken of the\npurchaser. He could not say all this to his father; but he spoke of\nRalph in such a way as to make his father understand what he thought.\n\"He is such a pleasant fellow,\" said Ralph, who was now the heir.\n\n\"Let us have him down here as soon as the thing is settled.\"\n\n\"Ah;--I don't think he'll come now. Of course he's wretched enough\nabout it. It is not wonderful that he should have hesitated at\nparting with it.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" said the Squire, who was willing to forgive past sins;\n\"but of course there was no help for it.\"\n\n\"That was what he didn't feel so sure about when he declined your\nfirst offer. It was not that he objected to the price. As to the\nprice he says that of course he can say nothing about it. When I\ntold him that you were willing to raise your offer, he declared that\nhe would take nothing in that fashion. If those who understood the\nmatter said that more was coming to him, he supposed that he would\nget it. According to my ideas he behaved very well, sir.\"\n\nIn this there was something that almost amounted to an accusation\nagainst the Squire. At least so the Squire felt it; and the feeling\nfor the moment robbed him of something of his triumph. According to\nhis own view there was no need for pity. It was plain that to his son\nthe whole affair was pitiful. But he could not scold his son;--at any\nrate not now. \"I feel this, Ralph,\" he said;--\"that from this moment\neverybody connected with the property, every tenant on it and every\nlabourer, will be better off than they were a month ago. I may have\nbeen to blame. I say nothing about that. But I do say that in all\ncases it is well that a property should go to the natural heir of the\nlife-tenant. Of course it has been my fault,\" he added after a pause;\n\"but I do feel now that I have in a great measure remedied the evil\nwhich I did.\" The tone now had become too serious to admit of further\nargument. Ralph, feeling that this was so, pressed his father's hand\nand then left him. \"Gregory is coming across to dinner,\" said the\nSquire as Ralph was closing the door behind him.\n\nAt that time Gregory had received no intimation of what had been done\nin London, his brother's note not reaching him till the following\nmorning. Ralph met him before the Squire came down, and the news was\nsoon told. \"It is all settled,\" said Ralph, with a sigh.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Your brother has agreed to sell.\"\n\n\"No!\"\n\n\"I have almost more pain than pleasure in it myself, because I know\nit will make you unhappy.\"\n\n\"He was so confident when he wrote to me!\"\n\n\"Yes;--but he explained all that. He had hoped then that he could\nhave saved it. But the manner of saving it would have been worse than\nthe loss. He will tell you everything, no doubt. No man could have\nbehaved better.\" As it happened, there was still some little space\nof time before the Squire joined them,--a period perhaps of five\nminutes. But the parson spoke hardly a word. The news which he now\nheard confounded him. He had been quite sure that his brother had\nbeen in earnest, and that his uncle would fail. And then, though\nhe loved the one Ralph nearly as well as he did the other,--though\nhe must have known that Ralph the base-born was in all respects a\nbetter man than his own brother, more of a man than the legitimate\nheir,--still to his feelings that legitimacy was everything. He too\nwas a Newton of Newton; but it may be truly said of him that there\nwas nothing selfish in his feelings. To be the younger brother of\nNewton of Newton, and parson of the parish which bore the same name\nas themselves, was sufficient for his ambition. But things would be\nterribly astray now that the right heir was extruded. Ralph, this\nRalph whom he loved so well, could not be the right Newton to own the\nproperty. The world would not so regard him. The tenants would not so\nthink of him. The county would not so repute him. To the thinking of\nparson Gregory, a great misfortune had been consummated. As soon as\nhe had realised it, he was silent and could speak no more.\n\nNor did Ralph say a word. Not to triumph in what had been done on his\nbehalf,--or at least not to seem to triumph,--that was the lesson\nwhich he had taught himself. He fully sympathised with Gregory; and\ntherefore he stood silent and sad by his side. That there must have\nbeen some triumph in his heart it is impossible not to imagine. It\ncould not be but that he should be alive to the glory of being the\nundoubted heir to Newton Priory. And he understood well that his\nbirth would interfere but little now with his position. Should he\nchoose to marry, as he would choose, it would of course be necessary\nthat he should explain his birth; but it was not likely, he thought,\nthat he should seek a wife among those who would reject him, with all\nhis other advantages, because he had no just title to his father's\nname. That he should take joy in what had been done on his behalf\nwas only natural; but as he stood with Gregory, waiting for his\nfather to come to them, he showed no sign of joy. At last the Squire\ncame. There certainly was triumph in his eye, but he did not speak\ntriumphantly. It was impossible that some word should not be spoken\nbetween them as to the disposition of the property. \"I suppose Ralph\nhas told you,\" he said, \"what he has done up in London?\"\n\n\"Yes;--he has told me,\" said Gregory.\n\n\"I hope there will now be an end of all family ill-feeling among us,\"\nsaid the uncle. \"Your brother shall be as welcome at the old place\nas I trust you have always found yourself. If he likes to bring his\nhorses here, we shall be delighted.\"\n\nThe parson muttered something as to the kindness with which he had\never been treated, but what he said was said with an ill grace. He\nwas almost broken-hearted, and thoroughly wished himself back in\nhis own solitude. The Squire saw it all, and did not press him to\ntalk;--said not a word more of his purchase, and tried to create some\nlittle interest about parish matters;--asked after the new building\nin the chancel, and was gracious about this old man and that young\nwoman. But Gregory could not recover himself,--could not recall his\nold interests, or so far act a part as to make it seem that he was\nnot thinking of the misfortune which had fallen upon the family. In\nevery look of his eyes and every tone of his voice he was telling\nthe son that he was a bastard, and the father that he was destroying\nthe inheritance of the family. But yet they bore with him, and\nendeavoured to win him back to pleasantness. Soon after the cloth was\ntaken away he took his leave. He had work to do at home, he said, and\nmust go. His uncle went out with him into the hall, leaving Ralph\nalone in the parlour. \"It will be for the best in the long run,\" said\nthe Squire, with his hand on his nephew's shoulder.\n\n\"Perhaps it may, sir. I am not pretending to say. Good night.\" As he\nwalked home across the park, through the old trees which he had known\nsince he was an infant, he told himself that it could not be for the\nbest that the property should be sent adrift, out of the proper line.\nThe only thing to be desired now was that neither he nor his brother\nshould have a child, and that there should no longer be a proper\nline.\n\nThe Squire's joy was too deep and well founded to be in any way\ndamped by poor Gregory's ill-humour, and was too closely present to\nhim for him to be capable of restraining it. Why should he restrain\nhimself before his son? \"I am sorry for Greg,\" he said, \"because he\nhas old-fashioned ideas. But of course it will be for the best. His\nbrother would have squandered every acre of it.\" To this Ralph made\nno answer. It might probably have been as his father said. It was\nperhaps best for all who lived in and by the estate that he should be\nthe heir. And gradually the feeling of exultation in his own position\nwas growing upon him. It was natural that it should do so. He knew\nhimself to be capable of filling with credit, and with advantage to\nall around him, the great place which was now assigned to him, and\nit was impossible that he should not be exultant. And he owed it to\nhis father to show him that he appreciated all that had been done\nfor him. \"I think he ought to have the \u00c2\u00a335,000 at least,\" said the\nSquire.\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"I think so. As for the bulk sum, I have already written to Carey\nabout that. No time ought to be lost. There is no knowing what might\nhappen. He might die.\"\n\n\"He doesn't look like dying, sir.\"\n\n\"He might break his neck out hunting. There is no knowing. At any\nrate there should be no delay. From what I am told I don't think that\nwith the timber and all they'll make it come to another \u00c2\u00a35,000; but\nhe shall have that. As he has behaved well, I'll show him that I can\nbehave well too. I've half a mind to go up to London, and stay till\nit's all through.\"\n\n\"You'd only worry yourself.\"\n\n\"I should worry myself, no doubt. And do you know, I love the place\nso much better than I did, that I can hardly bear to tear myself away\nfrom it. The first mark of my handiwork, now that I can work, shall\nbe put upon Darvell's farm. I'll have the old place about his ears\nbefore I am a day older.\"\n\n\"You'll not get it through before winter.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will. If it costs me an extra \u00c2\u00a350 I shan't begrudge it. It\nshall be a sort of memorial building, a farmhouse of thanksgiving.\nI'll make it as snug a place as there is about the property. It has\nmade me wretched for these two years.\"\n\n\"I hope all that kind of wretchedness will be over now.\"\n\n\"Thank God;--yes. I was looking at Brownriggs to-day,--and Ingram's.\nI don't think we'll sell either. I have a plan, and I think we can\npull through without it. It is so much easier to sell than to buy.\"\n\n\"You'd be more comfortable if you sold one of them.\"\n\n\"Of course I must borrow a few thousands;--but why not? I doubt\nwhether at this moment there's a property in all Hampshire so free as\nthis. I have always lived on less than the income, and I can continue\nto do so easier than before. You are provided for now, old fellow.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed;--and why should you pinch yourself?\"\n\n\"I shan't be pinched. I haven't got a score of women about me, as\nyou'll have before long. There's nothing in the world like having a\nwife. I am quite sure of that. But if you want to save money, the way\nto do it is not to have a nursery. You'll marry, of course, now?\"\n\n\"I suppose I shall some day.\"\n\n\"The sooner the better. Take my word for it.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you'd alter your opinion if I came upon you before Christmas\nfor your sanction.\"\n\n\"No, by Jove; that I shouldn't. I should be delighted. You don't mean\nto say you've got anybody in your eye. There's only one thing I ask,\nRalph;--open out-and-out confidence.\"\n\n\"You shall have it, sir.\"\n\n\"There is somebody, then.\"\n\n\"Well; no; there isn't anybody. It would be impudence in me to say\nthere was.\"\n\n\"Then I know there is.\" Upon this encouragement Ralph told his father\nthat on his two last visits to London he had seen a girl whom he\nthought that he would like to ask to be his wife. He had been at\nFulham on three or four occasions,--it was so he put it, but his\nvisits had, in truth, been only three,--and he thought that this\nniece of Sir Thomas Underwood possessed every charm that a woman need\npossess,--\"except money,\" said Ralph. \"She has no fortune, if you\ncare about that.\"\n\n\"I don't care about money,\" said the Squire. \"It is for the man to\nhave that;--at any rate for one so circumstanced as you.\" The end\nof all this was that Ralph was authorised to please himself. If he\nreally felt that he liked Miss Bonner well enough, he might ask her\nto be his wife to-morrow.\n\n\"The difficulty is to get at her,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"Ask the uncle for his permission. That's the manliest and the\nfittest way to do it. Tell him everything. Take my word for it he\nwon't turn his face against you. As for me, nothing on earth would\nmake me so happy as to see your children. If there were a dozen, I\nwould not think them one too many. But mark you this, Ralph; it will\nbe easier for us,--for you and me, if I live,--and for you without\nme if I go, to make all things clear and square and free while the\nbairns are little, than when they have to go to school and college,\nor perhaps want to get married.\"\n\n\"Ain't we counting our chickens before they are hatched?\" said Ralph\nlaughing.\n\nWhen they parted for the night, which they did not do till after the\nSquire had slept for an hour on his chair, there was one other speech\nmade,--a speech which Ralph was likely to remember to the latest day\nof his life. His father had taken his candlestick in his right hand,\nand had laid his left upon his son's collar. \"Ralph,\" said he, \"for\nthe first time in my life I can look you in the face, and not feel a\npang of remorse. You will understand it when you have a son of your\nown. Good-night, my boy.\" Then he hurried off without waiting to hear\na word, if there was any word that Ralph could have spoken.\n\nOn the next morning they were both out early at Darvell's farm,\nsurrounded by bricklayers and carpenters, and before the week was\nover the work was in progress. Poor Darvell, half elated and half\ntroubled, knew but little of the cause of this new vehemence.\nSomething we suppose he did know, for the news was soon spread over\nthe estate that the Squire had bought out Mr. Ralph, and that this\nother Mr. Ralph was now to be Mr. Ralph the heir. That the old butler\nshould not be told,--the butler who had lived in the house when the\npresent Squire was a boy,--was out of the question; and though the\ncommunication had been made in confidence, the confidence was not\nhermetical. The Squire after all was glad that it should be so. The\nthing had to be made known,--and why not after this fashion? Among\nthe labourers and poor there was no doubt as to the joy felt. That\nother Mr. Ralph, who had always been up in town, was unknown to them,\nand this Mr. Ralph had ever been popular with them all. With the\ntenants the feeling was perhaps more doubtful. \"I wish you joy, Mr.\nNewton, with all my heart,\" said Mr. Walker, who was the richest and\nthe most intelligent among them. \"The Squire has worked for you like\na man, and I hope it will come to good.\"\n\n\"I will do my best,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"I am sure you will. There will be a feeling, you know. You mustn't\nbe angry at that.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"You won't be vexed with me for just saying so.\" Ralph promised that\nhe would not be vexed, but he thought very much of what Mr. Walker\nhad said to him. After all, such a property as Newton does not in\nEngland belong altogether to the owner of it. Those who live upon it,\nand are closely concerned in it with reference to all that they have\nin the world, have a part property in it. They make it what it is,\nand will not make it what it should be, unless in their hearts they\nare proud of it. \"You know he can't be the real squire,\" said one old\nfarmer to Mr. Walker. \"They may hugger-mugger it this way and that;\nbut this Mr. Ralph can't be like t'other young gentleman.\"\n\nNevertheless the Squire himself was very happy. These things were\nnot said to him, and he had been successful. He took an interest in\nall things keener than he had felt for years past. One day he was in\nthe stables with his son, and spoke about the hunting for the coming\nseason. He had an Irish horse of which he was proud, an old hunter\nthat had carried him for the last seven years, and of which he had\noften declared that under no consideration would he part with it.\n\"Dear old fellow,\" he said, putting his hand on the animal's neck,\n\"you shall work for your bread one other winter, and then you shall\ngive over for the rest of your life.\"\n\n\"I never saw him look better,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"He's like his master;--not quite so young as he was once. He never\nmade a mistake yet that I know of.\"\n\nRalph when he saw how full of joy was his father, could not but\nrejoice also that the thing so ardently desired had been at last\naccomplished.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nTHE ELECTION.\n\n\nThe day of the nomination at Percycross came at last, and it was\nmanifest to everybody that there was a very unpleasant feeling in\nthe town. It was not only that party was arrayed against party. That\nwould have been a state of things not held to be undesirable, and\nat any rate would have been natural. But at present things were so\ndivided that there was no saying which were the existing parties.\nMoggs was separated from Westmacott quite as absolutely as was\nWestmacott from the two Conservative candidates. The old Liberals of\nthe borough were full of ridicule for poor Moggs, of whom all absurd\nstories were told by them both publicly and privately. But still he\nwas there, the darling of the workmen. It was, indeed, asserted by\nthe members of Mr. Westmacott's committee that Moggs's popularity\nwould secure for him but very few votes. A great proportion of\nthe working men of Percycross were freemen of the borough,--old\nvoters who were on the register by right of their birth and family\nconnection in the place, independent of householdership and\nrates,--and quite accustomed to the old ways of manipulation. The\nyounger of these men might be seduced into listening to Moggs. The\nexcitement was pleasant to them. But they were too well trained to be\nled away on the day of election. Moggs would give them no beer, and\nthey had always been accustomed to their three half-crowns a head in\nconsideration for the day's work. Not a dozen freemen of the borough\nwould vote for Moggs. So said Mr. Kirkham, Mr. Westmacott's managing\nman, and no man knew the borough quite so well as did Mr. Kirkham.\n\"They'll fight for him at the hustings,\" said Mr. Kirkham; \"but\nthey'll take their beer and their money, and they'll vote for us and\nGriffenbottom.\"\n\nThis might be true enough as regarded the freemen,--the men who had\nbeen, as it were, educated to political life;--but there was much\ndoubt as to the new voters. There were about a thousand of these in\nthe borough, and it had certainly not been the intention of either\nparty that these men should have the half-crowns. It was from\nthese men and their leaders,--the secretaries and chairmen and\npresidents,--that had come the cry for a second liberal candidate,\nand the consequent necessity of putting forward two Conservatives.\nThey were equally odious to the supporters of Westmacott and of\nGriffenbottom. \"They must have the half-crowns,\" Trigger had said\nto old Pile, the bootmaker. Pile thought that every working man was\nentitled to the three half-crowns, and said as much very clearly.\n\"I suppose old Griff ain't going to turn Hunks at this time o' day,\"\nsaid Mr. Pile. But the difficulties were endless, and were much\nbetter understood by Mr. Trigger than by Mr. Pile. The manner of\nconveying the half-crowns to the three hundred and twenty-four\nfreemen, who would take them and vote honestly afterwards for\nGriffenbottom and Underwood, was perfectly well understood. But\namong that godless, riotous, ungoverned and ungovernable set of new\nhouseholders, there was no knowing how to act. They would take the\nmoney and then vote wrong. They would take the money and then split.\nThe freemen were known. Three hundred and twenty-four would take\nGriffenbottom's beer and half-crowns. Two hundred and seventy-two\nwould be equally complaisant with Mr. Westmacott. But of these\nhouseholders nothing was known. They could not be handled. Some\nthirty or forty of them would probably have the turning of the\nelection at the last hour, must then be paid at their own prices, and\nafter that would not be safe! Mr. Trigger, in his disgust, declared\nthat things had got into so vile a form that he didn't care if he\nnever had anything to do with an election in Percycross again.\n\nAnd then there was almost as much ill-feeling between the\nold-fashioned Griffenbottomites and the Underwooders as there was\nbetween Westmacott's Liberals and Moggs's Radicals. The two gentlemen\nthemselves still eat their breakfasts and dinners together, and still\nparaded the streets of Percycross in each other's company. But\nSir Thomas had made himself very odious even to Mr. Griffenbottom\nhimself. He was always protesting against beer which he did see, and\nbribery which he did not see but did suspect. He swore that he would\npay not a shilling, as to which the cause of the expenditure was not\nexplained to him. Griffenbottom snarled at him, and expressed an\nopinion that Sir Thomas would of course do the same as any other\ngentleman. Mr. Trigger, with much dignity in his mien as he spoke,\ndeclared that the discussion of any such matter at the present moment\nwas indecorous. Mr. Pile was for sending Sir Thomas back to town, and\nvery strongly advocated that measure. Mr. Spicer, as to whom there\nwas a story abroad in the borough in respect of a large order for\nmustard, supposed to have reached him from New York through Liverpool\nby the influence of Sir Thomas Underwood, thought that the borough\nshould return the two conservative candidates. Sir Thomas might be\na little indiscreet; but, upon the whole, his principles did him\nhonour. So thought Mr. Spicer, who, perhaps, believed that the order\nfor the mustard was coming. We need hardly say that the story, at any\nrate in so far as it regarded Sir Thomas Underwood, was altogether\nuntrue. \"Yes; principles!\" said Mr. Pile. \"I think we all know Sam\nSpicer's principles. All for hisself, and nothing for a poor man.\nThat's Sam Spicer.\" Of Mr. Pile, it must be acknowledged that he was\nnot a pure-minded politician. He loved bribery in his very heart.\nBut it is equally true that he did not want to be bribed himself. It\nwas the old-fashioned privilege of a poor man to receive some small\nconsideration for his vote in Percycross, and Mr. Pile could not\nendure to think that the poor man should be robbed of his little\ncomforts.\n\nIn the meantime, Sir Thomas himself was in a state of great misery.\nFrom hour to hour he was fluctuating between a desire to run away\nfrom the accursed borough, and the shame of taking such a step. The\ndesire for the seat which had brought him to Percycross had almost\ndied out amidst the misery of his position. Among all the men of\nhis party with whom he was associating, there was not one whom he\ndid not dislike, and by whom he was not snubbed and contradicted.\nGriffenbottom, who went through his canvass under circumstances of\ncoming gout and colchicum with a courage and pertinacity that were\nheroic, was painfully cross to every one who was not a voter. \"What's\nthe use of all that d----d nonsense, now?\" he said to Sir Thomas the\nevening before the nomination day. There were half-a-dozen leading\nConservatives in the room, and Sir Thomas was making a final protest\nagainst bribery. He rose from his chair when so addressed, and left\nthe room. Never in his life before had he been so insulted. Trigger\nfollowed him to his bedroom, knowing well that a quarrel at this\nmoment would be absolutely suicidal. \"It's the gout, Sir Thomas,\"\nsaid Mr. Trigger. \"Do remember what he's going through.\" This was so\ntrue that Sir Thomas returned to the room. It was almost impossible\nnot to forgive anything in a man who was suffering agonies, but could\nstill wheedle a voter. There were three conservative doctors with Mr.\nGriffenbottom, each of them twice daily; and there was an opinion\nprevalent through the borough that the gout would be in his stomach\nbefore the election was over. Sir Thomas did return to the room,\nand sat himself down without saying a word. \"Sir Thomas,\" said Mr.\nGriffenbottom, \"a man with the gout is always allowed a little\nliberty.\"\n\n\"I admit the claim,\" said Sir Thomas, bowing.\n\n\"And believe me, I know this game better than you do. It's of no use\nsaying these things. No man should ever foul his own nest. Give me a\nlittle drop more brandy, Trigger, and then I'll get myself to bed.\"\nWhen he was gone, they all sang Griffenbottom's praises. In staunch\npluck, good humour, and manly fighting, no man was his superior.\n\"Give and take,--the English bull-dog all over. I do like old\nGriffenbottom,\" said Spiveycomb, the paper-maker.\n\nOn the day of nomination Griffenbottom was carried up on the\nhustings. This carrying did him good in the borough; but it should\nbe acknowledged on his behalf that he did his best to walk. In the\nextreme agony of his attack he had to make his speech, and he made\nit. The hustings stood in the market-square, and straight in front\nof the wooden erection, standing at right angles to it, was a stout\nrail dividing the space for the distance of fifty or sixty yards, so\nthat the supporters of one set of candidates might congregate on one\nside, and the supporters of the other candidates on the other side.\nIn this way would the weaker part, whichever might be the weaker,\nbe protected from the violence of the stronger. On the present\noccasion it seemed that the friends of Mr. Westmacott congregated\nwith the Conservatives. Moggs's allies alone filled one side of\nthe partition. There were a great many speeches made that day from\nthe hustings,--thirteen in all. First the mayor, and then the\nfour proposers and four seconders of the candidates. During these\nperformances, though there was so much noise from the crowd below\nthat not a word could be heard, there was no violence. When old\nGriffenbottom got up, supporting himself by an arm round one of the\nposts, he was loudly cheered from both sides. His personal popularity\nin the borough was undoubted, and his gout made him almost a\ndemi-god. Nobody heard a word that he said; but then he had no desire\nto be heard. To be seen standing up there, a martyr to the gout, but\nstill shouting for Percycross, was enough for his purpose. Sir Thomas\nencountered a very different reception. He was received with yells,\napparently from the whole crowd. What he said was of no matter,\nas not a word was audible; but he did continue to inveigh against\nbribery. Before he had ceased a huge stone was thrown at him, and\nhit him heavily on the arm. He continued speaking, however, and did\nnot himself know till afterwards that his arm was broken between\nthe shoulder and the elbow. Mr. Westmacott was very short and\ngood-humoured. He intended to be funny about poor Moggs;--and perhaps\nwas funny. But his fun was of no avail. The Moggite crowd had\ndetermined that no men should be heard till their own candidate\nshould open his mouth.\n\nAt last Ontario's turn had come. At first the roar from the crowd was\nso great that it seemed that it was to be with him as it had been\nwith the others. But by degrees, though there was still a roar,--as\nof the sea,--Moggs's words became audible. The voices of assent and\ndissent are very different, even though they be equally loud. Men\ndesirous of interrupting, do interrupt. But cheers, though they be\ncontinuous and loud as thunder, are compatible with a hearing. Moggs\nby this time, too, had learned to pitch his voice for an out-of-door\nmultitude. He preached his sermon, his old sermon, about the Rights\nof Labour and the Salt of the Earth, the Tyranny of Capital and\nthe Majesty of the Workmen, with an enthusiasm that made him for\nthe moment supremely happy. He was certainly the hero of the tour\nin Percycross, and he allowed himself to believe,--just for that\nhour,--that he was about to become the hero of a new doctrine\nthroughout England. He spoke for over half an hour, while poor\nGriffenbottom, seated in a chair that had been brought to him, was\nsuffering almost the pains of hell. During this speech Sir Thomas,\nwho had also suffered greatly, but had at first endeavoured to\nconceal that he was suffering, discovered the extent of his\nmisfortune, and allowed himself to be taken out from the hustings\nto his inn. There was an effort made to induce Mr. Griffenbottom\nto retire at the same time; but Mr. Griffenbottom, not quite\nunderstanding the extent of his colleague's misfortune, and thinking\nthat it became him to remain and to endure, was obdurate, and would\nnot be moved. He did not care for stones or threats,--did not care\neven for the gout. That was his place till after the show of hands,\nand there he would remain. The populace, seeing this commotion on\nthe hustings, began to fear that there was an intention to stop the\noratory of their popular candidate, and called loudly upon Moggs to\ngo on. Moggs did go on,--and was happy.\n\nAt last there came the show of hands. It was declared to be in\nfavour of Moggs and Westmacott. That it was very much in favour of\nMoggs,--in favour of Moggs by five to one, there was no doubt. Among\nthe other candidates there was not perhaps much to choose. A poll\nwas, of course, demanded for the two Conservatives; and then the\nmayor, complimenting the people on their good behaviour,--in spite\nof poor Sir Thomas's broken arm,--begged them to go away. That was\nall very well. Of course they would go away; but not till they had\ndriven their enemies from the field. In half a minute the dividing\nrail,--the rail that had divided the blue from the yellow,--was down,\nand all those who had dared to show themselves there as supporters\nof Griffenbottom and Underwood were driven ignominiously from the\nmarket-place. They fled at all corners, and in a few seconds not a\nstreak of blue ribbon was to be seen in the square. \"They'll elect\nthat fellow Moggs to-morrow,\" said Mr. Westmacott to Kirkham.\n\n\"No a bit of it,\" said Kirkham. \"I could spot all the ringleaders in\nthe row. Nine or ten of them are Griffenbottom's old men. They take\nhis money regularly,--get something nearly every year, join the rads\nat the nomination, and vote for the squire at the poll. The chaps who\nhollow and throw stones always vote t'other side up.\"\n\nMr. Griffenbottom kept his seat till he could be carried home\nin safety through the town, and was then put to bed. The three\nconservative doctors, who had all been setting Sir Thomas's arm, sat\nin consultation upon their old friend; and it was acknowledged on\nevery side that Mr. Griffenbottom was very ill indeed. All manner of\nrumours went through the town that night. Some believed that both\nGriffenbottom and Sir Thomas were dead,--and that the mayor had now\nno choice but to declare Moggs and Westmacott elected. Then there\narose a suspicion that the polls would be kept open on the morrow\non behalf of two defunct candidates, so that a further election on\nbehalf of the conservative party might be ensured. Men swore that\nthey would break into the bedrooms of the Standard Inn, in order that\nthey might satisfy themselves whether the two gentlemen were alive or\ndead. And so the town was in a hubbub.\n\nOn that evening Moggs was called upon again to address his friends at\nthe Mechanics' Institute, and to listen to the speeches of all the\npresidents and secretaries and chairmen; but by ten o'clock he was\nalone in his bedroom at the Cordwainers' Arms. Down-stairs men were\nshouting, singing, and drinking,--shouting in his honour, though not\ndrinking at his expense. He was alone in his little comfortless room,\nbut felt it to be impossible that he should lie down and rest. His\nheart was swelling with the emotions of the day, and his mind was\nfull of his coming triumph. It was black night, and there was a soft\ndrizzling rain;--but it was absolutely necessary for his condition\nthat he should go out. It seemed to him that his very bosom would\nburst, if he confined himself in that narrow space. His thoughts were\ntoo big for so small a closet. He crept downstairs and out, through\nthe narrow passage, into the night. Then, by the light of the\nsolitary lamp that stood before the door of the public-house, he\ncould still see those glorious words, \"Moggs, Purity, and the Rights\nof Labour.\" Noble words, which had sufficed to bind to him the whole\npopulation of that generous-hearted borough! Purity and the Rights of\nLabour! Might it not be that with that cry, well cried, he might move\nthe very world! As he walked the streets of the town he felt a great\nlove for the borough grow within his bosom. What would he not owe to\nthe dear place which had first recognised his worth, and had enabled\nhim thus early in life to seize hold of those ploughshares which it\nwould be his destiny to hold for all his coming years? He had before\nhim a career such as had graced the lives of the men whom he had\nmost loved and admired,--of men who had dared to be independent,\npatriotic, and philanthropical, through all the temptations of\npolitical life. Would he be too vain if he thought to rival a Hume\nor a Cobden? Conceit, he said to himself, will seek to justify itself.\nWho can rise but those who believe their wings strong enough for\nsoaring? There might be shipwreck of course,--but he believed that he\nnow saw his way. As to the difficulty of speaking in public,--that\nhe had altogether overcome. Some further education as to facts,\nhistorical and political, might be necessary. That he acknowledged to\nhimself;--but he would not spare himself in his efforts to acquire\nsuch education. He went pacing through the damp, muddy, dark streets,\nmaking speeches that were deliciously eloquent to his own ears. That\nnight he was certainly the happiest man in Percycross, never doubting\nhis success on the morrow,--not questioning that. Had not the whole\ntown greeted him with loudest acclamation as their chosen member?\nHe was deliciously happy;--while poor Sir Thomas was suffering\nthe double pain of his broken arm and his dissipated hopes, and\nGriffenbottom was lying in his bed, with a doctor on one side and a\nnurse on the other, hardly able to restrain himself from cursing all\nthe world in his agony.\n\nAt a little after eleven a tall man, buttoned up to his chin in an\nold great coat, called at the Percy Standard, and asked after the\nhealth of Mr. Griffenbottom and Sir Thomas. \"They ain't neither of\nthem very well then,\" replied the waiter. \"Will you say that Mr.\nMoggs called to inquire, with his compliments,\" said the tall man.\nThe respect shown to him was immediately visible. Even the waiter at\nthe Percy Standard acknowledged that for that day Mr. Moggs must be\ntreated as a great man in Percycross. After that Moggs walked home\nand crept into bed;--but it may be doubted whether he slept a wink\nthat night.\n\nAnd then there came the real day,--the day of the election. It was\na foul, rainy, muddy, sloppy morning, without a glimmer of sun,\nwith that thick, pervading, melancholy atmosphere which forces for\nthe time upon imaginative men a conviction that nothing is worth\nanything. Griffenbottom was in bed in one room at the Percy Standard,\nand Underwood in the next. The three conservative doctors moving\nfrom one chamber to another, watching each other closely, and hardly\nleaving the hotel, had a good time of it. Mr. Trigger had already\nremarked that in one respect the breaking of Sir Thomas's arm was\nlucky, because now there would be no difficulty as to paying the\ndoctors out of the common fund. Every half-hour the state of the\npoll was brought to them. Early in the morning Moggs had been in the\nascendant. At half-past nine the numbers were as follows:--\n\n\n   Moggs          193\n   Westmacott     172\n   Griffenbottom  162\n   Underwood      147\n\n\nAt ten, and at half-past ten, Moggs was equally in advance,\nbut Westmacott had somewhat receded. At noon the numbers were\nconsiderably altered, and were as follows:--\n\n\n   Griffenbottom  892\n   Moggs          777\n   Westmacott     752\n   Underwood      678\n\n\nThese at least were the numbers as they came from the conservative\nbooks. Westmacott was placed nearer to Moggs by his own tellers. For\nMoggs no special books were kept. He was content to abide by the\nofficial counting.\n\nGriffenbottom was consulted privately by Trigger and Mr. Spiveycomb\nas to what steps should be taken in this emergency. It was suggested\nin a whisper that Underwood should be thrown over altogether. There\nwould be no beating Moggs,--so thought Mr. Spiveycomb,--and unless an\neffort were made it might be possible that Westmacott would creep up.\nTrigger in his heart considered that it would be impossible to get\nenough men at three half-crowns a piece to bring Sir Thomas up to a\nwinning condition. But Griffenbottom, now that the fight was forward,\nwas unwilling to give way a foot. \"We haven't polled half the\nvoters,\" said he.\n\n\"More than half what we shall poll,\" answered Trigger.\n\n\"They always hang back,\" growled Griffenbottom. \"Fight it out. I\ndon't believe they'll ever elect a shoemaker here.\" The order was\ngiven, and it was fought out.\n\nMoggs, early in the morning, had been radiant with triumph, when he\nsaw his name at the head of the lists displayed from the two inimical\ncommittee rooms. As he walked the streets, with a chairman on one\nside of him and a president on the other, it seemed as though his\nfeet almost disdained to touch the mud. These were two happy hours,\nduring which he did not allow himself to doubt of his triumph. When\nthe presidents and the chairmen spoke to him, he could hardly answer\nthem, so rapt was he in contemplation of his coming greatness. His\nvery soul was full of his seat in Parliament! But when Griffenbottom\napproached him on the lists, and then passed him, there came a shadow\nupon his brow. He still felt sure of his election, but he would\nlose that grand place at the top of the poll to which he had taught\nhimself to look so proudly. Soon after noon a cruel speech was made\nto him. \"We've about pumped our side dry,\" said a secretary of a\nYoung Men's Association.\n\n\"Do you mean we've polled all our friends?\" asked Moggs.\n\n\"Pretty nearly, Mr. Moggs. You see our men have nothing to wait for,\nand they came up early.\" Then Ontario's heart sank within him, and he\nbegan to think of the shop in Bond Street.\n\nThe work of that afternoon in Percycross proved how correct Mr.\nGriffenbottom had been in his judgment. He kept his place at the top\nof the poll. It was soon evident that that could not be shaken. Then\nWestmacott passed by Moggs, and in the next half-hour Sir Thomas\ndid so also. This was at two, when Ontario betook himself to the\nprivacy of his bedroom at the Cordwainers' Arms. His pluck left him\naltogether, and he found himself unable to face the town as a losing\ncandidate. Then for two hours there was a terrible struggle between\nWestmacott and Underwood, during which things were done in the\ndesperation of the moment, as to which it might be so difficult to\ngive an account, should any subsequent account be required. We all\nknow how hard it is to sacrifice the power of winning, when during\nthe heat of the contest the power of winning is within our reach. At\nfour o'clock the state of the poll was as follows:--\n\n\n   Griffenbottom  1402\n   Underwood      1007\n   Westmacott      984\n   Moggs           821\n\n\nWhen the chairmen and presidents waited upon Moggs, telling him of\nthe final result, and informing him that he must come to the hustings\nand make a speech, they endeavoured to console him by an assurance\nthat he, and he alone, had fought the fight fairly. \"They'll both be\nunseated, you know, as sure as eggs,\" said the president. \"It can't\nbe otherwise. They've been busy up in a little room in Petticoat\nCourt all the afternoon, and the men have been getting as much as\nfifteen shillings a head!\" Moggs was not consoled, but he did make\nhis speech. It was poor and vapid;--but still there was just enough\nof manhood left in him for that. As soon as his speech had been\nspoken he escaped up to London by the night mail train. Westmacott\nalso spoke; but announcement was made on behalf of the members of the\nborough that they were, both of them, in their beds.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\n\"MISS MARY IS IN LUCK.\"\n\n\nThe election took place on a Tuesday,--Tuesday, the 17th of October.\nOn the following day one of the members received a visit in his\nbedroom at the Percy Standard which was very pleasant to him. His\ndaughter Patience had come down to nurse Sir Thomas and take him back\nto Fulham. Sir Thomas had refused to allow any message to be sent\nhome on the day on which the accident had occurred. On the following\nmorning he had telegraphed to say that his arm had been broken, but\nthat he was doing very well. And on the Wednesday Patience was with\nhim.\n\nIn spite of the broken arm it was a pleasant meeting. For the last\nfortnight Sir Thomas had not only not seen a human being with whom he\ncould sympathise, but had been constrained to associate with people\nwho were detestable to him. His horror of Griffenbottom, his disgust\nat Trigger, his fear of Mr. Pabsby's explanations, and his inability\nto cope with Messrs. Spicer and Roodylands when they spoke of mustard\nand boots, had been almost too much for him. The partial seclusion\noccasioned by his broken arm had been a godsend to him. In such a\nstate he was prepared to feel that his daughter's presence was an\nangel's visit. And even to him his success had something of the\npleasure of a triumph. Of course he was pleased to have won the seat.\nAnd though whispers of threats as to a petition had already reached\nhim, he was able in these, the first hours of his membership, to\nthrow his fears on that head behind him. The man must be of a most\ncold temperament who, under such circumstances, cannot allow himself\nsome short enjoyment of his new toy. It was his at least for the\ntime, and he probably told himself that threatened folk lived long.\nThat Patience should take glory in the victory was a matter of\ncourse. \"Dear papa,\" she said, \"if you can only get your arm well\nagain!\"\n\n\"I don't suppose there is any cause for fear as to that.\"\n\n\"But a broken arm is a great misfortune,\" said Patience.\n\n\"Well;--yes. One can't deny that. And three Percycross doctors are\nthree more misfortunes. I must get home as soon as I can.\"\n\n\"You mustn't be rash, papa, even to escape from Percycross. But, oh,\npapa; we are so happy and so proud. It is such an excellent thing\nthat you should be in Parliament again.\"\n\n\"I don't know that, my dear.\"\n\n\"We feel it so,--Clary and I,--and so does Mary. I can't tell you\nthe sort of anxiety we were in all day yesterday. First we got the\ntelegram about your arm,--and then Stemm came down at eight and told\nus that you were returned. Stemm was quite humane on the occasion.\"\n\n\"Poor Stemm!--I don't know what he'll have to do.\"\n\n\"It won't matter to him, papa;--will it? And then he told me another\npiece of news.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"You won't like it, papa. We didn't like it at all.\"\n\n\"What is it, my dear?\"\n\n\"Stemm says that Ralph has sold all the Newton Priory estate to his\nuncle.\"\n\n\"It is the best thing he could do.\"\n\n\"Really, papa?\"\n\n\"I think so. He must have done that or made some disreputable\nmarriage.\"\n\n\"I don't think he would have done that,\" said Patience.\n\n\"But he was going to do it. He had half-engaged himself to some\ntailor's daughter. Indeed, up to the moment of your telling me this I\nthought he would marry her.\" Poor Clary! So Patience said to herself\nas she heard this. \"He had got himself into such a mess that the best\nthing he could do was to sell his interest to his uncle. The estate\nwill go to a better fellow, though out of the proper line.\"\n\nThen Patience told her father that she had brought a letter for him\nwhich had been given to her that morning by Stemm, who had met her at\nthe station.\n\n\"I think,\" she said, \"that it comes from some of the Newton family\nbecause of the crest and the Basingstoke postmark.\" Then the letter\nwas brought;--and as it concerns much the thread of our story, it\nshall be given to the reader;--\n\n\n   Newton Priory, October 17, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR SIR THOMAS UNDERWOOD,--\n\n   I write to you with the sanction, or rather at the\n   instigation, of my father to ask your permission to become\n   a suitor to your niece, Miss Bonner. You will probably\n   have heard, or at least will hear, that my father has made\n   arrangements with his nephew Ralph, by which the reversion\n   of the Newton property will belong to my father. It is his\n   intention to leave the estate to me, and he permits me to\n   tell you that he will consent to any such settlement in\n   the case of my marriage, as would have been usual, had\n   I been his legitimate heir. I think it best to be frank\n   about this, as I should not have ventured to propose\n   such a marriage either to you or to Miss Bonner, had\n   not my father's solicitude succeeded in placing me in\n   circumstances which may, perhaps, be regarded as in part\n   compensating the great misfortune of my birth.\n\n   It may probably be right that I should add that I have\n   said no word on this subject to Miss Bonner. I have\n   hitherto felt myself constrained by the circumstances to\n   which I have alluded from acting as other men may act.\n   Should you be unwilling to concede that the advantages\n   of fortune which have now fallen in my way justify me in\n   proposing to myself such a marriage, I hope that you will\n   at least excuse my application to yourself.\n\n   Very faithfully yours,\n\n   RALPH NEWTON.\n\n\nSir Thomas read the letter twice before he spoke a word to his\ndaughter. Then, after pausing with it for a moment in his hand, he\nthrew it to her across the bed. \"Miss Mary is in luck,\" he said;--\"in\nvery great luck. It is a magnificent property, and as far as I can\nsee, one of the finest young fellows I ever met. You understand about\nhis birth?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Patience, almost in a whisper.\n\n\"It might be a hindrance to him in some circumstances; but not here.\nIt is nothing here. Did you know of this?\"\n\n\"No, indeed.\"\n\n\"Nor Mary?\"\n\n\"It will be quite a surprise to her. I am sure it will.\"\n\n\"You think, then, that there has been nothing said,--not a word about\nit?\"\n\n\"I am sure there has not, papa. Clarissa had some joke with\nMary,--quite as a joke.\"\n\n\"Then there has been a joke?\"\n\n\"It meant nothing. And as for Mr. Newton, he could not have dreamed\nof anything of the kind. We all liked him.\"\n\n\"So did I. The property will be much better with him than with the\nother. Mary is a very lucky girl. That's all I can say. As for the\nletter, it's the best letter I ever read in my life.\"\n\nThere was some delay before Sir Thomas could write an answer to young\nNewton. It was, indeed, his left arm that had suffered; but even\nwith so much of power abstracted, writing is not an easy task. And\nthis was a letter the answering of which could not be deputed to any\nsecretary. On the third day after its receipt Sir Thomas did manage\nwith much difficulty to get a reply written.\n\n\n   DEAR MR. NEWTON,--\n\n   I have had my left arm broken in the election here. Hence\n   the delay. I can have no objection. Your letter does you\n   infinite honour. I presume you know that my niece has no\n   fortune.\n\n   Yours, most sincerely,\n\n   THOMAS UNDERWOOD.\n\n\n\"What a pity it is,\" said Sir Thomas, \"that a man can't have a broken\narm in answering all letters. I should have had to write ever so much\nhad I been well. And yet I could not have said a word more that would\nhave been of any use.\"\n\nSir Thomas was kept an entire week at the Percycross Standard after\nhis election was over before the three doctors and the innkeeper\nbetween them would allow him to be moved. During this time there was\nvery much discussion between the father and daughter as to Mary's\nprospects; and a word or two was said inadvertently which almost\nopened the father's eyes as to the state of his younger daughter's\naffections. It is sometimes impossible to prevent the betrayal of a\nconfidence, when the line between betrayal and non-betrayal is finely\ndrawn. It was a matter of course that there should be much said about\nthat other Ralph, the one now disinherited and dispossessed, who\nhad so long and so intimately been known to them; and it was almost\nimpossible for Patience not to show the cause of her great grief.\nIt might be, as her father said, that the property would be better\nin the hands of this other young man; but Patience knew that her\nsympathies were with the spendthrift, and with the dearly-loved\nsister who loved the spendthrift. Since Clarissa had come to speak\nso openly of her love, to assert it so loudly, and to protest that\nnothing could or should shake it, Patience had been unable not to\nhope that the heir might at last prove himself worthy to be her\nsister's husband. Then they heard that his inheritance was sold.\n\"It won't make the slightest difference to me,\" said Clary almost\ntriumphantly, as she discussed the matter with Patience the evening\nbefore the journey to Percycross. \"If he were a beggar it would be\nthe same.\" To Patience, however, the news of the sale had been a\ngreat blow. And now her father told her that this young man had been\nthinking of marrying another girl, a tailor's daughter;--that such a\nmarriage had been almost fixed. Surely it would be better that steps\nshould be taken to wean her sister from such a passion! But yet she\ndid not tell the secret. She only allowed a word to escape her, from\nwhich it might be half surmised that Clarissa would be a sufferer.\n\"What difference will it make to Clary?\" asked Sir Thomas.\n\n\"I have sometimes thought that he cared for her,\" said Patience\ncunningly. \"He would hardly have been so often at the villa, unless\nthere had been something.\"\n\n\"There must be nothing of that kind,\" said Sir Thomas. \"He is a\nspendthrift, and quite unworthy of her. I will not have him at the\nvilla. He must be told so. If you see anything of that kind, you\nmust inform me. Do you understand, Patience?\" Patience understood\nwell enough, but knew not what reply to make. She could not tell her\nsister's secret. And if there were faults in the matter, was it not\nher father's fault? Why had he not lived with them, so that he might\nsee these things with his own eyes? \"There must be nothing of that\nkind,\" said Sir Thomas, with a look of anger in his eyes.\n\nWhen the week was over, the innkeeper and the doctors submitting\nwith but a bad grace, the member for Percycross returned to London\nwith his arm bound up in a sling. The town was by this time quite\ntranquil. The hustings had been taken down, and the artizans of the\nborough were back at their labours, almost forgetting Moggs and his\ngreat doctrines. That there was to be a petition was a matter of\ncourse. It was at least a matter of course that there should be\nthreats of a petition. The threat of course reached Sir Thomas's\nears, but nothing further was said to him. When he and his daughter\nwent down to the station in the Standard fly, it almost seemed that\nhe was no more to the borough than any other man might be with a\nbroken arm. \"I shall not speak of this to Mary,\" he said on his\njourney home. \"Nor should you, I think, my dear.\"\n\n\"Of course not, papa.\"\n\n\"He should have the opportunity of changing his mind after receiving\nmy letter, if he so pleases. For her sake I hope he will not.\"\nPatience said nothing further. She loved her cousin Mary, and\ncertainly had felt no dislike for this fortunate young man. But she\ncould not so quickly bring herself to sympathise with interests which\nseemed to be opposed to those of her sister.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI.\n\nIT IS ALL SETTLED.\n\n\nIn the last half of this month of October the Squire at Newton was\nvery pressing on his lawyers up in London to settle the affairs of\nthe property. He was most anxious to make a new will, but could not\ndo so till his nephew had completed the sale, and till the money had\nbeen paid. He had expressed a desire to go up to London and remain\nthere till all was done; but against this his son had expostulated,\nurging that his father could not hasten the work up in London by\nhis presence, but would certainly annoy and flurry everybody in the\nlawyer's office. Mr. Carey had promised that the thing should be\ndone with as little delay as possible, but Mr. Carey was not a man\nto be driven. Then again the Squire would be a miserable man up\nin London, whereas at the Priory he might be so happy among the\nnew works which he had already inaugurated. The son's arguments\nprevailed,--especially that argument as to the pleasure of the\nSquire's present occupations,--and the Squire consented to remain at\nhome.\n\nThere seemed to be an infinity of things to be done, and to the\nSquire himself the world appeared to require more of happy activity\nthan at any previous time of his life. He got up early, and was out\nabout the place before breakfast. He had endless instructions to give\nto everybody about the estate. The very air of the place was sweeter\nto him than heretofore. The labourers were less melancholy at their\nwork. The farmers smiled oftener. The women and children were more\ndear to him. Everything around him had now been gifted with the grace\nof established ownership. His nephew Gregory, after that last dinner\nof which mention was made, hardly came near him during the next\nfortnight. Once or twice the Squire went up to the church during\nweek days that he might catch the parson, and even called at the\nparsonage. But Gregory was unhappy, and would not conceal his\nunhappiness. \"I suppose it will wear off,\" said the Squire to his\nson.\n\n\"Of course it will, sir.\"\n\n\"It shall not be my fault if it does not. I wonder whether it would\nhave made him happier to see the property parcelled out and sold to\nthe highest bidder after my death.\"\n\n\"It is not unnatural, if you think of it,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"Perhaps not; and God forbid that I should be angry with him because\nhe cannot share my triumph. I feel, however, that I have done my\nduty, and that nobody has a right to quarrel with me.\"\n\nAnd then there were the hunters. Every sportsman knows, and the\nwives and daughters of all sportsmen know, how important a month in\nthe calendar is the month of October. The real campaign begins in\nNovember; and even for those who do not personally attend to the\nearlier work of the kennel,--or look after cub-hunting, which during\nthe last ten days of October is apt to take the shape of genuine\nhunting,--October has charms of its own and peculiar duties. It is\nthe busiest month in the year in regard to horses. Is physic needed?\nIn the Squire's stables physic was much eschewed, and the Squire's\nhorses were usually in good condition. But it is needful to know,\ndown to a single line on the form, whether this or that animal wants\nmore exercise,--and if so, of what nature. We hold that for hunters\nwhich are worked regularly throughout the season, and which live in\nloose boxes summer and winter, but little exercise is required except\nin the months of September and October. Let them have been fed on\noats throughout the year, and a good groom will bring them into form\nin two months. Such at least was the order at the Newton stables;\nand during this autumn,--especially during these last days of\nOctober,--this order was obeyed with infinite alacrity, and with many\npreparations for coming joys. And there are other cares, less onerous\nindeed, but still needful. What good sportsman is too proud, or even\ntoo much engaged, to inspect his horse's gear,--and his own? Only\nlet his horses' gear stand first in his mind! Let him be sure that\nthe fit of a saddle is of more moment than the fit of a pair of\nbreeches;--that in riding the length, strength, and nature of the bit\nwill avail more,--should at least avail more,--than the depth, form,\nand general arrangement of the flask; that the question of boots,\ngreat as it certainly is, should be postponed to the question of\nshoes; that a man's seat should be guarded by his girths rather than\nby his spurs; that no run has ever been secured by the brilliancy of\nthe cravat, though many a run has been lost by the insufficiency of a\nstirrup-leather. In the stables and saddle-room, and throughout the\nwhole establishment of the house at Newton, all these matters were\never sedulously regarded; but they had never been regarded with more\njoyful zeal than was given to them during this happy month. There was\nnot a stable-boy about the place who did not know and feel that their\nMr. Ralph was now to take his place in the hunting-field as the heir\nto Newton Priory.\n\nAnd there were other duties at Newton of which the crowd of\nriding-men know little or nothing. Were there foxes in the coverts?\nThe Squire had all his life been a staunch preserver, thinking more\nof a vixen with her young cubs than he would of any lady in the land\nwith her first-born son. During the last spring and summer, however,\nthings had made him uncomfortable; and he had not personally inquired\nafter the well-being of each nursery in the woods as had been his\nwont. Ralph, indeed, had been on the alert, and the keepers had not\nbecome slack;--but there had been a whisper about the place that the\nmaster didn't care so much about the foxes as he used to do. They\nsoon found out that he cared enough now. The head-keeper opened his\neyes very wide when he was told that the Squire would take it as a\npersonal offence if the coverts were ever drawn blank. It was to be\nunderstood through the county that at Newton Priory everything now\nwas happy and prosperous. \"We'll get up a breakfast and a meet on\nthe lawn before the end of the month,\" said the Squire to his son.\n\"I hate hunt breakfasts myself, but the farmers like them.\" From all\nwhich the reader will perceive that the Squire was in earnest.\n\nRalph hunted all through the latter days of October, but the Squire\nhimself would not go out till the first regular day of the season.\n\"I like a law, and I like to stick to it,\" he said. \"Five months\nis enough for the horses in all conscience.\" At last the happy day\narrived,--Wednesday, the 2nd of November,--and the father and son\nstarted together for the meet in a dog-cart on four wheels with\ntwo horses. On such occasions the Squire always drove himself, and\nprofessed to go no more than eight miles an hour. The meet was over\nin the Berkshire county in the neighbourhood of Swallowfield, about\ntwelve miles distant, and the Squire was in his seat precisely at\nhalf-past nine. Four horses had gone on in the charge of two grooms,\nfor the Squire had insisted on Ralph riding with a second horse. \"If\nyou don't, I won't,\" he had said; and Ralph of course had yielded.\nJust at this time there had grown up in the young man's mind a\nfeeling that his father was almost excessive in the exuberance of his\njoy,--that he was displaying too ostensibly to the world at large\nthe triumph which he had effected. But the checking of this elation\nwas almost impossible to the son on whose behalf it was exhibited.\nTherefore, to Ralph's own regret, the two horses had on this morning\nbeen sent on to Barford Heath. The Squire was not kept waiting a\nmoment. Ralph lit his cigar and jumped in, and the Squire started in\nall comfort and joy. The road led them by Darvell's farm, and for a\nmoment the carriage was stopped that a word might be spoken to some\nworkman. \"You'd better have a couple more men, Miles. It won't do to\nlet the frost catch us,\" said the Squire. Miles touched his hat, and\nassented. \"The house will look very well from here,\" said the Squire,\npointing down through a line of trees. Ralph assented cheerily; and\nyet he thought that his father was spending more money than Darvell's\nhouse need to have cost him.\n\nThey reached Barford Heath a few minutes before eleven, and there was\na little scene upon the occasion. It was the first recognised meet of\nthe season, and the Squire had not been out before. It was now known\nto almost every man there that the owner of Newton Priory had at\nlast succeeded in obtaining the reversion of the estate for his own\nson; and though the matter was one which hardly admitted of open\ncongratulation, still there were words spoken and looks given, and\na little additional pressure in the shaking of hands,--all of which\nseemed to mark a triumph. That other Ralph had not been known in the\ncounty. This Ralph was very popular; and though of course there was\nexistent some amount of inner unexpressed feeling that the proper\nline of an old family was being broken, that for the moment was kept\nin abeyance, and all men's faces wore smiles as they were turned\nupon the happy Squire. He hardly carried himself with as perfect a\nmoderation as his son would have wished. He was a little loud,--not\nsaying much to any one openly about the property, uttering merely\na word or two in a low voice in answer to the kind expressions of\none or two specially intimate friends; but in discussing other\nmatters,--the appearance of the pack, the prospects of the season,\nthe state of the county,--he was not quite like himself. In his\nordinary way he was a quiet man, not often heard at much distance,\nand contented to be noted as Newton of Newton rather than as a man\ncommanding attention by his conduct before other men. There certainly\nwas a difference to-day, and it was of that kind which wine produces\non some who are not habitual drinkers. The gases of his life were in\nexuberance, and he was as a balloon insufficiently freighted with\nballast. His buoyancy, unless checked, might carry him too high among\nthe clouds. All this Ralph saw, and kept himself a little aloof. If\nthere were aught amiss, there was no help for it on his part; and,\nafter all, what was amiss was so very little amiss.\n\n\"We'll draw the small gorses first,\" said the old master, addressing\nhimself specially to Mr. Newton, \"and then we'll go into Barford\nWood.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" said the Squire; \"the gorses first by all means. I\nremember when there was always a fox at Barford Gorse. Come along. I\nhate to see time wasted. You'll be glad to hear we're full of foxes\nat Newton. There were two litters bred in Bostock Spring;--two,\nby Jove! in that little place. Dan,\"--Dan was his second\nhorseman,--\"I'll ride the young one this morning. You have Paddywhack\nfresh for me about one.\" Paddywhack was the old Irish horse which had\ncarried him so long, and has been mentioned before. There was nothing\nremarkable in all this. There was no word spoken that might not have\nbeen said with a good grace by any old sportsman, who knew the men\naround him, and who had long preserved foxes for their use;--but\nstill it was felt that the Squire was a little loud. Ralph the son,\non whose behalf all this triumph was felt, was silenter than usual,\nand trotted along at the rear of the long line of horsemen.\n\nOne specially intimate friend of his,--a man whom he really\nloved,--hung back with the object of congratulating him. \"Ralph,\"\nsaid George Morris, of Watheby Grove, a place about four miles from\nthe Priory, \"I must tell you how glad I am of all this.\"\n\n\"All right, old fellow.\"\n\n\"Come; you might show out a little to me. Isn't it grand? We shall\nalways have you among us now. Don't tell me that you are\nindifferent.\"\n\n\"I think enough about it, God knows, George. But it seems to me that\nthe less said about it the better. My father has behaved nobly to\nme, and of course I like to feel that I've got a place in the world\nmarked out for me. But--\"\n\n\"But what?\"\n\n\"You understand it all, George. There shouldn't be rejoicing in a\nfamily because the heir has lost his inheritance.\"\n\n\"I can't look at it in that line.\"\n\n\"I can't look at it in any other,\" said Ralph. \"Mind you, I'm not\nsaying that it isn't all right. What has happened to him has come of\nhis own doings. I only mean that we ought to be quiet about it. My\nfather's spirits are so high, that he can hardly control them.\"\n\n\"By George, I don't wonder at it,\" said George Morris.\n\nThere were three little bits of gorse about half-a-mile from Barford\nWood, as to which it seemed that expectation did not run high, but\nfrom the last of which an old fox broke before the hounds were in\nit. It was so sudden a thing that the pack was on the scent and away\nbefore half-a-dozen men had seen what had happened. Our Squire had\nbeen riding with Cox, the huntsman, who had ventured to say how happy\nhe was that the young squire was to be the Squire some day. \"So am I,\nCox; so am I,\" said the Squire. \"And I hope he'll be a friend to you\nfor many a year.\"\n\n\"By the holy, there's Dick a-hallooing,\" said Cox, forgetting at\nonce the comparatively unimportant affairs of Newton Priory in the\nbreaking of this unexpected fox. \"Golly;--if he ain't away, Squire.\"\nThe hounds had gone at once to the whip's voice, and were in full cry\nin less time than it has taken to tell the story of \"the find.\" Cox\nwas with them, and so was the Squire. There were two or three others,\nand one of the whips. The start, indeed, was not much, but the burst\nwas so sharp, and the old fox ran so straight, that it sufficed to\nenable those who had got the lead to keep it. \"Tally-ho!\" shouted the\nSquire, as he saw the animal making across a stubble field before the\nhounds, with only one fence between him and the quarry. \"Tally-ho!\"\nIt was remarked afterwards that the Squire had never been known to\nhalloo to a fox in that way before. \"Just like one of the young\n'uns, or a fellow out of the town,\" said Cox, when expressing his\nastonishment.\n\nBut the Squire never rode a run better in his life. He gave a lead to\nthe field, and he kept it. \"I wouldn't 'a spoilt him by putting my\nnose afore 'is, were it ever so,\" said Cox afterwards. \"He went as\nstraight as a schoolboy at Christmas, and the young horse he rode\nnever made a mistake. Let men say what they will, a young horse will\ncarry a man a brush like that better than an old one. It was very\nshort. They had run their fox, pulled him down, broken him up, and\neaten him within half an hour. Jack Graham, who is particular about\nthose things, and who was, at any rate, near enough to see it all,\nsaid that it was exactly twenty-two minutes and a half. He might\nbe right enough in that, but when he swore that they had gone over\nfour miles of ground, he was certainly wrong. They killed within a\nfield of Heckfield church, and Heckfield church can't be four miles\nfrom Barford Gorse. That they went as straight as a line everybody\nknew. Besides, they couldn't have covered the ground in the time.\nThe pace was good, no doubt; but Jacky Graham is always given to\nexaggeration.\"\n\nThe Squire was very proud of his performance, and, when Ralph came\nup, was loud in praise of the young horse. \"Never was carried so well\nin my life,--never,\" said he. \"I knew he was good, but I didn't know\nhe would jump like that. I wouldn't take a couple of hundred for\nhim.\" This was still a little loud; but the Squire at this moment had\nthe sense of double triumph within, and was to be forgiven. It was\nadmitted on all sides that he had ridden the run uncommonly well.\n\"Just like a young man, by Jove,\" said Jack Graham. \"Like what sort\nof a young man?\" asked George Harris, who had come up at the heel of\nthe hunt with Ralph.\n\n\"And where were you, Master Ralph?\" said the Squire to his son.\n\n\"I fancy I just began to know they were running by the time you were\nkilling your fox,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"You should have your eyes better about you, my boy; shouldn't he,\nCox?\"\n\n\"The young squire ain't often in the wrong box,\" said the huntsman.\n\n\"He wasn't in the right one to-day,\" said the Squire. This was still\na little loud. There was too much of that buoyancy which might have\ncome from drink; but which, with the Squire, was the effect of that\nsuccess for which he had been longing rather than hoping all his\nlife.\n\nFrom Heckfield they trotted back to Barford Wood, the master\nresolving that he would draw his country in the manner he had\nproposed to himself in the morning. There was some little repining\nat this, partly because the distance was long, and partly because\nBarford Woods were too large to be popular. \"Hunting is over for the\nday,\" said Jack Graham. To this view of the case the Squire, who had\nnow changed his horse, objected greatly. \"We shall find in Barford\nbig wood as sure as the sun rises,\" said he. \"Yes,\" said Jack, \"and\nrun into the little wood and back to the big wood, and so on till we\nhate every foot of the ground. I never knew anything from Barford\nWoods yet for which a donkey wasn't as good as a horse.\" The Squire\nagain objected, and told the story of a run from Barford Woods twenty\nyears ago which had taken them pretty nearly on to Ascot Heath.\n\"Things have changed since that,\" said Jack Graham. \"Very much for\nthe better,\" said the Squire. Ralph was with him then, and still\nfelt that his father was too loud. Whether he meant that hunting was\nbetter now than in the old days twenty years ago, or that things as\nregarded the Newton estate were better, was not explained; but all\nwho heard him speak imagined that he was alluding to the latter\nsubject.\n\nDrawing Barford Woods is a very different thing than drawing Barford\nGorses. Anybody may see a fox found at the gorses who will simply\ntake the trouble to be with the hounds when they go into the covert;\nbut in the wood it becomes a great question with a sportsman whether\nhe will stick to the pack or save his horse and loiter about till he\nhears that a fox has been found. The latter is certainly the commoner\ncourse, and perhaps the wiser. And even when the fox has been found\nit may be better for the expectant sportsman to loiter about till\nhe breaks, giving some little attention to the part of the wood in\nwhich the work of hunting may be progressing. There are those who\nsystematically stand still or roam about very slowly;--others, again,\nwho ride and cease riding by spurts, just as they become weary or\nimpatient;--and others who, with dogged perseverance, stick always to\nthe track of the hounds. For years past the Squire was to have been\nfound among the former and more prudent set of riders, but on this\noccasion he went gallantly through the thickest of the underwood,\nclose at the huntsman's heels. \"You'll find it rather nasty, Mr.\nNewton, among them brakes,\" Cox had said to him. But the Squire had\nanswered that he hadn't got his Sunday face on, and had persevered.\n\nThey were soon on a fox in Barford Wood;--but being on a fox in\nBarford Wood was very different from finding a fox in Barford Gorse.\nOut of the gorse a fox must go; but in the big woods he might choose\nto remain half the day. And then the chances were that he would\neither beat the hounds at last, or else be eaten in covert. \"It's a\nvery pretty place to ride about and smoke and drink one's friend's\nsherry.\" That was Jack Graham's idea of hunting in Barford Woods, and\na great deal of that kind of thing was going on to-day. Now and then\nthere was a little excitement, and cries of \"away\" were heard. Men\nwould burst out of the wood here and there, ride about for a few\nminutes, and then go in again. Cox swore that they had thrice changed\ntheir fox, and was beginning to be a little short in his temper; the\nwhips' horses were becoming jaded, and the master had once or twice\nanswered very crossly when questioned. \"How the devil do you suppose\nI'm to know,\" he had said to a young gentleman who had inquired,\n\"where they were?\" But still the Squire kept on zealously, and\nreminded Ralph that some of the best things of the season were often\nlost by men becoming slack towards evening. At that time it was\nnearly four o'clock, and Cox was clearly of opinion that he couldn't\nkill a fox in Barford Woods that day.\n\nBut still the hounds were hunting. \"Darned if they ain't back to the\nlittle wood again,\" said Cox to the Squire. They were at that moment\nin an extreme corner of an outlying copse, and between them and\nBarford Little Wood was a narrow strip of meadow, over which they had\npassed half-a-dozen times that day. Between the copse and the meadow\nthere ran a broad ditch with a hedge,--a rotten made-up fence of\nsticks and bushes, which at the corner had been broken down by the\nconstant passing of horses, till, at this hour of the day, there was\nhardly at that spot anything of a fence to be jumped. \"We must cross\nwith them again, Cox,\" said the Squire. At that moment he was nearest\nto the gap, and close to him were Ralph and George Morris, as well\nas the huntsman. But Mr. Newton's horse was standing sideways to the\nhedge, and was not facing the passage. He, nevertheless, prepared to\npass it first, and turned his horse sharply at it; as he did so, some\nbush or stick caught the animal in the flank, and he, in order to\nescape the impediment, clambered up the bank sideways, not taking\nthe gap, and then balanced himself to make his jump over the ditch.\nBut he was entangled among the sticks and thorns and was on broken\nground, and jumping short, came down into the ditch. The Squire fell\nheavily head-long on to the field, and the horse, with no further\neffort of his own, but unable to restrain himself, rolled over his\nmaster. It was a place as to which any horseman would say that a\nchild might ride through if on a donkey without a chance of danger,\nand yet the three men who saw it knew at once that the Squire had\nhad a bad fall. Ralph was first through the gap, and was off his own\nhorse as the old Irish hunter, with a groan, collected himself and\ngot upon his legs. In rising, the animal was very careful not to\nstrike his late rider with his feet; but it was too evident to Cox\nthat the beast in his attempt to rise had given a terrible squeeze to\nthe prostrate Squire with his saddle.\n\nIn a moment the three men were on their knees, and it was clear that\nMr. Newton was insensible. \"I'm afraid he's hurt,\" said Morris. Cox\nmerely shook his head, as he gently attempted to raise the Squire's\nshoulder against his own. Ralph, as pale as death, held his father's\nhand in one of his own, and with the other endeavoured to feel the\npulse of the heart. Presently, before any one else came up to them, a\nfew drops of blood came from between the sufferer's lips. Cox again\nshook his head. \"We'd better get him on to a gate, Mr. Ralph, and\ninto a house,\" said the huntsman. They were quickly surrounded by\nothers, and the gate was soon there, and within twenty minutes a\nsurgeon was standing over our poor old friend. \"No; he wasn't dead,\"\nthe surgeon said; \"but--.\" \"What is it?\" asked Ralph, impetuously.\nThe surgeon took the master of the hunt aside and whispered into his\near that Mr. Newton was a dead man. His spine had been so injured by\nthe severity of his own fall, and by the weight of the horse rolling\non him while he was still doubled up on the ground, that it was\nimpossible that he should ever speak again. So the surgeon said, and\nSquire Newton never did speak again.\n\n\n[Illustration: In a moment the three men were on their knees,\nand it was clear that Mr. Newton was insensible.]\n\n\nHe was carried home to the house of a gentleman who lived in those\nparts, in order that he might be saved the longer journey to the\nPriory;--but the length of the road mattered but little to him. He\nnever spoke again, nor was he sensible for a moment. Ralph remained\nwith him during the night,--of course,--and so did the surgeon.\nAt five o'clock on the following morning his last breath had been\ndrawn, and his life had passed away from him. George Morris also\nhad remained with them,--or rather had come back to the house after\nhaving ridden home and changed his clothes, and it was by him that\nthe tidings were at last told to the wretched son. \"It is all over,\nRalph!\" \"I suppose so!\" said Ralph, hoarsely. \"There has never been a\ndoubt,\" said George, \"since we heard of the manner of the accident.\"\n\"I suppose not,\" said Ralph. The young man sat silent, and composed,\nand made no expression of his grief. He did not weep, nor did his\nface even wear that look of woe which is so common to us all when\ngrief comes to us. They two were still in the room in which the\nbody lay, and were standing close together over the fire. Ralph was\nleaning on his elbow upon the chimneypiece, and from time to time\nMorris would press his arm. They had been standing together thus for\nsome twenty minutes when Morris asked a question.\n\n\"The affair of the property had been settled, Ralph?\"\n\n\"Don't talk of that now,\" said the other angrily. Then, after\na pause, he put up his face and spoke again. \"Nothing has been\nsettled,\" he said. \"The estate belongs to my cousin Ralph. He should\nbe informed at once,--at once. He should he telegraphed to, to come\nto Newton. Would you mind doing it? He should be informed at once.\"\n\n\"There is time enough for that,\" said George Morris.\n\n\"If you will not I must,\" replied Ralph.\n\nThe telegram was at once sent in duplicate, addressed to that other\nRalph,--Ralph who was declared by the Squire's son to be once more\nRalph the heir,--addressed to him both at his lodgings in London and\nat the Moonbeam. When the messenger had been sent to the nearest\nrailway station with the message, Ralph and his friend started for\nNewton Priory together. Poor Ralph still wore his boots and breeches\nand the red coat in which he had ridden on the former fatal day, and\nin which he had passed the night by the side of his dying father's\nbed. On their journey homeward they met Gregory, who had heard of the\naccident, and had at once started to see his uncle.\n\n\"It is all over!\" said Ralph. Gregory, who was in his gig, dropped\nthe reins and sat in silence. \"It is all done. Let us get on, George.\nIt is horrid to me to be in this coat. Get on quickly. Yes, indeed;\neverything is done now.\"\n\nHe had lost a father who had loved him dearly, and whom he had dearly\nloved,--a father whose opportunities of showing his active love had\nbeen greater even than fall to the lot of most parents. A father\ngives naturally to his son, but the Squire had been almost unnatural\nin his desire to give. There had never been a more devoted father,\none more intensely anxious for his son's welfare;--and Ralph had\nknown this, and loved his father accordingly. Nevertheless, he could\nnot keep himself from remembering that he had now lost more than\na father. The estate as to which the Squire had been so full of\ninterest,--as to which he, Ralph, had so constantly endeavoured to\nprotect himself from an interest that should be too absorbing,--had\nin the last moment escaped him. And now, in this sad and solemn hour,\nhe could not keep himself from thinking of that loss. As he had stood\nin the room in which the dead body of his father had been lying, he\nhad cautioned himself against this feeling. But still he had known\nthat it had been present to him. Let him do what he would with his\nown thoughts, he could not hinder them from running back to the fact\nthat by his father's sudden death he had lost the possession of the\nNewton estate. He hated himself for remembering such a fact at such a\ntime, but he could not keep himself from remembering it. His father\nhad fought a life-long battle to make him the heir of Newton, and had\nperished in the moment of his victory,--but before his victory was\nachieved. Ralph had borne his success well while he had thought that\nhis success was certain; but now--! He knew that all such subjects\nshould be absent from his mind with such cause for grief as weighed\nupon him at this moment,--but he could not drive away the reflection.\nThat other Ralph Newton had won upon the post. He would endeavour to\nbear himself well, but he could not but remember that he had been\nbeaten. And there was the father who had loved him so well lying\ndead!\n\nWhen he reached the house, George Morris was still with him. Gregory,\nto whom he had spoken hardly a word, did not come beyond the\nparsonage. Ralph could not conceal from himself, could hardly conceal\nfrom his outward manner, the knowledge that Gregory must be aware\nthat his cause had triumphed. And yet he hated himself for thinking\nof these things, and believed himself to be brutal in that he could\nnot conceal his thoughts. \"I'll send over for a few things, and stay\nwith you for a day or two,\" said George Morris. \"It would be bad that\nyou should be left here alone.\" But Ralph would not permit the visit.\n\"My father's nephew will be here to-morrow,\" he said, \"and I would\nrather that he should find me alone.\" In thinking of it all, he\nremembered that he must withdraw his claims to the hand of Mary\nBonner, now that he was nobody. He could have no pretension now to\noffer his hand to any such girl as Mary Bonner!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII.\n\nSIR THOMAS AT HOME.\n\n\nSir Thomas Underwood was welcomed home at the villa with a double\namount of sympathy and glory,--that due to him for his victory being\nadded to that which came to him on the score of his broken arm. A\nhero is never so much a hero among women as when he has been wounded\nin the battle. The very weakness which throws him into female hands\nimparts a moiety of his greatness to the women who for the while\npossess him, and creates a partnership in heroism, in which the\nfeminine half delights to make the most of its own share. During\nthe week at Percycross and throughout the journey Patience had had\nthis half all to herself; and there had arisen to her considerable\nenjoyment from it as soon as she found that her father would probably\nbe none the worse for his accident after a few weeks. She saw more of\nhim now than she had done for years, and was able, after a fashion,\nto work her quiet, loving, female will with him, exacting from him\nan obedience to feminine sway such as had not been exercised on him\nsince his wife's death. He himself had been humbled, passive, and\nhappy. He had taken his gruel, grumbled with modesty, and consoled\nhimself with constantly reflecting that he was member of Parliament\nfor the borough of Percycross.\n\nDuring their journey, although Patience was urgent in requiring from\nher father quiescence, lest he should injure himself by too much\nexertion, there were many words spoken both as to Clarissa and Mary\nBonner. As to poor Clary, Sir Thomas was very decided that if there\nwere any truth in the suspicion which had been now roused in his mind\nas to Ralph the heir, the thing must be put an end to at once. Ralph\nwho had been the heir was now in possession of that mess of pottage\nfor which he had sold his inheritance,--so said Sir Thomas to his\ndaughter,--and would undoubtedly consume that, as he had consumed the\nother mess which should have lasted him till the inheritance was his\nown. And he told to Patience the whole story as to Polly Neefit,--the\nwhole story, at least, as he had heard it. Ralph had declared to Sir\nThomas, when discussing the expedience of his proposed marriage with\nthe daughter of the breeches-maker, that he was attached to Polly\nNeefit. Sir Thomas had done all he could to dissuade the young man\nfrom a marriage which, in his eyes, was disgraceful; but he could\nnot bring himself to look with favour on affections transferred so\nquickly from the breeches-maker's daughter to his own. There must be\nno question of a love affair between Clary and the foolish heir who\nhad disinherited himself by his folly. All this was doubly painful to\nPatience. She suffered first for her sister, the violence of whose\nfeelings were so well known to her, and so completely understood; and\nthen on her own account she was obliged to endure the conviction that\nshe was deceiving her father. Although she had allowed something of\nthe truth to escape from her, she had not wilfully told her sister's\nsecret. But looking at the matter from her father's point of view,\nand hearing all that her father now said, she was brought in guilty\nof hypocrisy in the court of her own conscience.\n\nIn that other matter as to Mary Bonner there was much more of\npleasantness. There could be no possible reason why that other man,\nto whom Fortune was going to be so good, should not marry Mary\nBonner, if Mary could bring herself to take him into her good graces.\nAnd of course she would. Such at least was Sir Thomas's opinion.\nHow was it possible that a girl like Mary, who had nothing of her\nown, should fail to like a lover who had everything to recommend\nhim,--good looks, good character, good temper, and good fortune.\nPatience did make some protest against this, for the sake of her sex.\nShe didn't think, she said, that Mary had ever thought of Mr. Newton\nin that light. \"There must be a beginning to such thoughts, of\ncourse,\" said Sir Thomas. Patience explained that she had nothing\nto say against Mr. Newton. It would all be very nice and proper, no\ndoubt,--only perhaps Mary might not care for Mr. Newton. \"Psha!\"\nsaid Sir Thomas. Sir Thomas seemed to think that the one girl was\nas much bound to fall in love as the other was to abstain from so\ndoing. Patience continued her protest,--but very mildly, because her\nfather's arm was in a sling. Then there arose the question whether\nMary should be told of the young man's letter. Patience thought that\nthe young man should be allowed to come and speak for himself. Sir\nThomas made no objection to the young man's coming. The young man\nmight come when he pleased. But Sir Thomas thought it would be well\nthat Mary should know what the young man had written. And so they\nreached home.\n\nTo be glorified by one worshipping daughter had been pleasant to the\nwounded hero, but to be glorified by two daughters and a niece was\nalmost wearisome. On the first evening nothing was said about the\nlove troubles or love prospects of the girls. Sir Thomas permitted to\nhimself the enjoyment of his glory, with some few signs of impatience\nwhen the admiration became too strong. He told the whole story of\nhis election, lying back among his cushions on the sofa, although\nPatience, with mild persistence, cautioned him against exertion.\n\n\"It is very bad that you should have your arm broken, papa,\" said\nClarissa.\n\n\"It is a bore, my dear.\"\n\n\"Of course it is,--a dreadful bore. But as it is doing so well, I am\nso glad that you went down to Percycross. It is such a great thing\nthat you should be in the House again. It does give so much colour to\nour lives here.\"\n\n\"I hope they were not colourless before.\"\n\n\"You know what I mean. It is so nice to feel that you are in\nParliament.\"\n\n\"It is quite on the cards that I may lose the seat by petition.\"\n\n\"They never can be so cruel,\" said Mary.\n\n\"Cruelty!\" said Sir Thomas laughing. \"In politics men skin each other\nwithout the slightest feeling. I do not doubt that Mr. Westmacott\nwould ruin me with the most perfect satisfaction, if by doing so he\ncould bring the seat within his own reach again; and yet I believe\nMr. Westmacott to be a kind-hearted, good sort of man. There is a\ntheory among Englishmen that in politics no man need spare another.\nTo wish that your opponent should fall dead upon the hustings is not\nan uncharitable wish at an election.\"\n\n\"Oh, papa!\" exclaimed Patience.\n\n\"At any rate you are elected,\" said Clary.\n\n\"And threatened folk live long, uncle,\" said Mary Bonner.\n\n\"So they say, my dear. Well, Patience, don't look at me with so much\nreprobation in your eyes, and I will go to bed at once. Being here\ninstead of at the Percy Standard does make one inclined to take a\nliberty.\"\n\n\"Oh, papa, it is such a delight to have you,\" said Clary, jumping up\nand kissing her father's forehead. All this was pleasant enough, and\nthe first evening came to an end very happily.\n\nThe next morning Patience, when she was alone with her father, made\na request to him with some urgency. \"Papa,\" she said, \"do not say\nanything to Clary about Ralph.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"If there is anything in it, let it die out of itself.\"\n\n\"But is there?\"\n\n\"How am I to say? Think of it, papa. If I knew it, I could hardly\ntell,--even you.\"\n\n\"Why not? If I am not to hear the truth from you who is to tell me?\"\n\n\"Dear papa, don't be angry. There may be a truth which had better not\nbe told. What we both want is that Clary shouldn't suffer. If you\nquestion her she will suffer. You may be sure of this,--that she will\nobey your wishes.\"\n\n\"How can she obey them, unless she knows them?\"\n\n\"She shall know them,\" said Patience. But Sir Thomas would give no\npromise.\n\nOn that same day Sir Thomas sent for his niece into his room, and\nthere read to her the letter which he had received from the Squire's\nson. It was now the last week of October,--that short blessed morsel\nof time which to the poor Squire at Newton was the happiest of his\nlife. He was now cutting down trees and building farm-houses, and\nlooking after his stud in all the glory of his success. Ralph had\nwritten his letter, and had received his answer,--and he also was\nsuccessful and glorious. That fatal day on which the fox would not\nbreak from Barford Woods had not yet arrived. Mary Bonner heard the\nletter read, and listened to Sir Thomas's speech without a word,\nwithout a blush, and without a sign. Sir Thomas began his speech very\nwell, but became rather misty towards the end, when he found himself\nunable to reduce Mary to a state of feminine confusion. \"My dear,\" he\nbegan, \"I have received a letter which I think it is my duty to read\nto you.\"\n\n\"A letter, uncle?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear. Sit down while I read it. I may as well tell you at\nonce that it is a letter which has given me very great satisfaction.\nIt is from a young gentleman;\"--upon hearing this announcement Mary's\nface assumed a look of settled, collected strength, which never left\nit for a moment during the remainder of the interview,--\"yes; from a\nyoung gentleman, and I may say that I never read a letter which I\nthought to be more honourable to the writer. It is from Mr. Ralph\nNewton,--not the Ralph with whom you have found us to be so intimate,\nbut from the other who will some day be Mr. Newton of Newton Priory.\"\nThen Sir Thomas looked into his niece's face, hoping to see there\nsomething of the flutter of expectant triumph. But there was neither\nflutter nor triumph in Mary's countenance. He read the letter,\nsitting up in his bed, with his left arm in a sling, and then he\nhanded it to her. \"You had better look at it yourself, my dear.\" Mary\ntook the letter, and sat as though she were reading it. It seemed\nto Sir Thomas that she was reading it with the cold accuracy of a\ncautious attorney;--but in truth her eyes did not follow a single\nword of the letter. There was neither flutter nor triumph in her\nface, or in the movement of her limbs, or in the quiet, almost\nmotionless carriage of her body; but, nevertheless, the pulses of her\nheart beat so strongly, that had all depended on it she could not\nhave read a word of the letter. \"Well, my dear,\" said Sir Thomas,\nwhen he thought that ample time had been given for the perusal. Mary\nsimply folded the paper together and returned it into his hands. \"I\nhave told him, as I was bound to do, my dear, that as far as I was\nconcerned, I should be happy to receive him; but that for any other\nanswer, I must refer him to you. Of course it will be for you to give\nhim what answer your heart dictates. But I may say this,--and it\nis my duty to say it as your guardian and nearest relative;--the\nway in which he has put forward his request shows him to be a most\nhonourable man; all that I have ever heard of him is in his favour;\nhe is a gentleman every inch of him; and as for his prospects in\nlife, they are such that they entitle him to address almost any\nlady in the land. Of course you will follow the dictates of your\nown heart, as I said; but I cannot myself fancy any greater good\nfortune that could come in the way of a young woman than the honest\naffections of such a man as this Ralph Newton.\" Then Sir Thomas\npaused for some reply, but Mary had none ready for him. \"Of course I\nhave no questions to ask,\" he said, and then again paused. But still\nMary did not speak. \"I dare say he will be here before long, and I\nhope that he may meet with a happy reception. I at least shall be\nglad to see him, for I hold him in great honour. And as I look upon\nmarriage as the happiest lot for all women, and as I think that this\nwould be a happy marriage, I do hope,--I do hope-- But as I said\nbefore, all that must be left to yourself. Mary, have you nothing to\nsay?\"\n\n\"I trust, uncle, you are not tired of me.\"\n\n\"Tired of you! Certainly not. I have not been with you since you\nhave been here as much as I should have wished because,--indeed for\nvarious reasons. But we all like you, and nobody wants to get rid of\nyou. But there is a way in which young ladies leave their own homes,\nwhich is generally thought to be matter of congratulation. But, as I\nsaid before, nobody shall press you.\"\n\n\"Dear uncle, I am so full of thanks to you for your kindness.\"\n\n\"But it is of course my duty as your guardian to tell you that in my\nopinion this gentleman is entitled to your esteem.\"\n\nAfter that Mary left him without another word, and taking her hat\nand cloak as she passed through the hall went at once out into the\ngarden. It was a fine autumn morning, almost with a touch of summer\nin it. We do not know here that special season which across the\nAtlantic is called the Indian summer,--that last glow of the year's\nwarmth which always brings with it a half melancholy conviction of\nthe year's decay,--which in itself is so delightful, would be so\nfull of delight, were it not for the consciousness which it seems\nto contain of being the immediate precursor of winter with all its\nhorrors. There is no sufficient constancy with us of the recurrence\nof such a season, to make any special name needful. But now and\nagain there comes a day, when the winds of the equinox have lulled\nthemselves, and the chill of October rains have left the earth, and\nthe sun gives a genial, luxurious warmth, with no power to scorch,\nwith strength only to comfort. But here, as elsewhere, this luxury\nis laden with melancholy, because it tells us of decay, and is the\nharbinger of death. This was such a day, and Mary Bonner, as she\nhurried into a shrubbery walk, where she could wander unseen, felt\nboth the sadness and the softness of the season. There was a path\nwhich ran from the front gate of the villa grounds through shrubs\nand tall evergreens down to the river, and was continued along the\nriver-bank up through the flower-garden to windows opening from the\ndrawing-room. Here she walked alone for more than an hour, turning as\nshe came to the river in order that she might not be seen from the\nhouse.\n\nMary Bonner, of whose character hitherto but little has been said,\nwas, at any rate, an acute observer. Very soon after her first\nintroduction to Ralph the heir,--Ralph who had for so many years been\nthe intimate friend of the Underwood family,--she perceived something\nin the manner of that very attractive young man which conveyed\nto her a feeling that, if she so pleased, she might count him as\nan admirer of her own. She had heard then, as was natural, much\nof the brilliance of his prospects, and but little,--as was also\nnatural,--of what he had done to mar them. And she also perceived,\nor fancied that she perceived, that her cousin Clary gave many of\nher thoughts to the heir. Now Mary Bonner understood the importance\nto herself of a prosperous marriage, as well as any girl ever did\nunderstand its great significance. She was an orphan, living in fact\non the charity of her uncle. And she was aware that having come\nto her uncle's house when all the weakness and attractions of her\nchildhood were passed, she could have no hold on him or his such as\nwould have been hers had she grown to be a woman beneath his roof.\nThere was a thoughtfulness too about her,--a thoughtfulness which\nsome, perhaps, may call worldliness,--which made it impossible for\nher not to have her own condition constantly in her mind. In her\nfather's lifetime she had been driven by his thoughtlessness and her\nown sterner nature to think of these things; and in the few months\nthat had passed between her father's death and her acceptance in\nher uncle's house she had taught herself to regard the world as an\narena in which she must fight a battle by her own strength with such\nweapons as God had given to her. God had, indeed, given to her many\nweapons, but she knew but of one. She did know that God had made\nher very beautiful. But she regarded her beauty after an unfeminine\nfashion,--as a thing of value, but as a chattel of which she could\nnot bring herself to be proud. Might it be possible that she should\nwin for herself by her beauty some position in the world less\nburdensome, more joyous than that of a governess, and less dependent\nthan that of a daily recipient of her uncle's charity?\n\nShe had had lovers in the West Indies,--perhaps a score of them,\nbut they had been nothing to her. Her father's house had been so\nconstituted that it had been impossible for her to escape the very\nplainly spoken admiration of captains, lieutenants, and Colonial\nsecretaries. In the West Indies gentlemen do speak so very plainly,\non, or without, the smallest encouragement, that ladies accept such\nspeaking much as they do in England the attention of a handkerchief\nlifted or an offer for a dance. It had all meant nothing to Mary\nBonner, who from her earliest years of girlhood had been accustomed\nto captains, lieutenants, and even to midshipmen. But, through it\nall, she had grown up with serious thoughts, and something of a\nconviction that love-making was but an ugly amusement. As far as it\nhad been possible she had kept herself aloof from it, and though run\nafter for her beauty, had been unpopular as being a \"proud, cold,\nmeaningless minx.\" When her father died she would speak to no one;\nand then it had been settled among the captains, lieutenants, and\nColonial secretaries that she was a proud, cold, meaningless minx.\nAnd with this character she left the island. Now there came to her,\nnaturally I say, this question;--What lovers might she find in\nEngland, and, should she find lovers, how should she deal with them?\nThere are among us many who tell us that no pure-minded girl should\nthink of finding a lover,--should only deal with him, when he comes,\nas truth, and circumstances, and parental control may suggest to her.\nIf there be girls so pure, it certainly seems that no human being\nexpects to meet them. Such was not the purity of Mary Bonner,--if\npure she was. She did think of some coming lover,--did hope that\nthere might be for her some prosperity of life as the consequence of\nthe love of some worthy man whom she, in return, might worship. And\nthen there had come Ralph Newton the heir.\n\nNow to Mary Bonner,--as also to Clarissa Underwood, and to Patience,\nand to old Mrs. Brownlow, and a great many others, Ralph the heir\ndid not appear in quite those colours which he probably will in\nthe reader's eyes. These ladies, and a great many other ladies\nand gentlemen who reckoned him among their acquaintance, were not\naccurately acquainted with his transactions with Messrs. Neefit,\nMoggs, and Horsball; nor were they thoroughly acquainted with the\neasy nature of our hero's changing convictions. To Clarissa he\ncertainly was heroic; to Patience he was very dear; to old Mrs.\nBrownlow he was almost a demigod; to Mr. Poojean he was an object\nof envy. To Mary Bonner, as she first saw him, he was infinitely\nmore fascinating than the captains and lieutenants of West Indian\nregiments, or than Colonial secretaries generally.\n\nIt was during that evening at Mrs. Brownlow's that Mary Bonner\nresolutely made up her mind that she would be as stiff and cold to\nRalph the heir as the nature of their acquaintance would allow. She\nhad seen Clarissa without watching, and, without thinking, she had\nresolved. Mr. Newton was handsome, well to do, of good address, and\nclever;--he was also attractive; but he should not be attractive for\nher. She would not, as her first episode in her English life, rob\na cousin of a lover. And so her mind was made up, and no word was\nspoken to any one. She had no confidences. There was no one in whom\nshe could confide. Indeed, there was no need for confidence. As\nshe left Mrs. Brownlow's house on that evening she slipped her arm\nthrough that of Patience, and the happy Clarissa was left to walk\nhome with Ralph the heir,--as the reader may perhaps remember.\n\nThen that other Ralph had come, and she learned in half-pronounced\nambiguous whispers what was the nature of his position in the world.\nShe did not know,--at that time her cousins did not know,--how nearly\nsuccessful were the efforts made to dispossess the heir of his\ninheritance in order that this other Newton might possess it. But she\nsaw, or thought that she saw, that this was the gallanter man of the\ntwo. Then he came again, and then again, and she knew that her own\nbeauty was of avail. She encouraged him not at all. It was not in her\nnature to give encouragement to a man's advances. It may, perhaps, be\nsaid of her that she had no power to do so. What was in her of the\ngraciousness of feminine love, of the leaning, clinging, flattering\nsoftness of woman's nature, required some effort to extract, and had\nnever hitherto been extracted. But within her own bosom she told\nherself that she thought that she could give it, if the asking for it\nwere duly done. Then came the first tidings of his heirship, of his\nfather's success,--and then, close upon the heels of those tidings,\nthis heir's humbly expressed desire to be permitted to woo her. There\nwas all the flutter of triumph in her bosom, as that letter was\nread to her, and yet there was no sign of it in her voice or in her\ncountenance.\n\nNor could it have been seen had she been met walking in the shade of\nthat shrubbery. And yet she was full of triumph. Here was the man to\nwhom her heart had seemed to turn almost at first sight, as it had\nnever turned to man before. She had deigned to think of him as of one\nshe could love;--and he loved her. As she paced the walk it was also\nmuch to her that this man who was so generous in her eyes should have\nprovided for him so noble a place in the world. She quite understood\nwhat it was to be the wife of such a one as the Squire of Newton.\nShe had grieved for Clary's sake when she heard that the former heir\nshould be heir no longer,--suspecting Clary's secret. But she could\nnot so grieve as to be insensible of her own joy. And then there was\nsomething in the very manner in which the man approached her, which\ngratified her pride while it touched her heart. About that other\nRalph there was a tone of sustained self-applause, which seemed to\ndeclare that he had only to claim any woman and to receive her.\nThere was an old-fashioned mode of wooing of which she had read and\ndreamed, that implied a homage which she knew that she desired. This\nhomage her Ralph was prepared to pay.\n\nFor an hour she paced the walk, not thinking, but enjoying what she\nknew. There was nothing in it requiring thought. He was to come, and\ntill he should come there was nothing that she need either say or do.\nTill he should come she would do nothing and say nothing. Such was\nher determination when Clarissa's step was heard, and in a moment\nClarissa's arm was round her waist. \"Mary,\" she said, \"you must come\nout with me. Come and walk with me. I am going to Mrs. Brownlow's.\nYou must come.\"\n\n\"To walk there and back?\" said Mary, smiling.\n\n\"We will return in an omnibus; but you must come. Oh, I have so much\nto say to you.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\n\n\"TELL ME AND I'LL TELL YOU.\"\n\n\n\"Papa has told me all about it,\" were Clarissa's first words as soon\nas they were out of the gate on the road to Mrs. Brownlow's.\n\n\"All about what, Clary?\"\n\n\"Oh you know;--or rather it was Patience told me, and then I asked\npapa. I am so glad.\"\n\nMary had as yet hardly had time to think whether the coming of\nthis letter to her uncle would or would not be communicated to her\ncousins; but had she thought, she would have been almost sure that\nSir Thomas would be more discreet. The whole matter was to her so\nimportant, so secret, almost so solemn, that she could hardly imagine\nthat it should be discussed among the whole household. And yet she\nfelt a strong longing within herself to be able to talk of it to some\none. Of the two cousins Clary was certainly her favourite, and had\nshe been forced to consult any one, she would have consulted Clary.\nBut an absolute confidence in such a matter with a chosen friend,\nthe more delightful it might appear, was on that very account the\nmore difficult of attainment. It was an occasion for thought, for\ndoubt, and almost for dismay; and now Clary rushed into it as though\neverything could be settled in a walk from Fulham to Parson's Green!\n\"It is very good of you to be glad, Clary,\" said the other,--hardly\nknowing why she said this, and yet meaning it. If in truth Clary was\nglad, it was good of her. For this man to whom Clary was alluding had\nwon from her own lover all his inheritance.\n\n\"I like him so much. You will let me talk about him; won't you?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Mary.\n\n\"Do; pray do. There are so many reasons why we should tell each other\neverything.\" This elicited no promise from Mary. \"If I thought that\nyou would care, I would tell you all.\"\n\n\"I care about everything that concerns you, Clary.\"\n\n\"But I didn't bring you out to talk about myself now. I want to tell\nyou how much I like your Ralph Newton.\"\n\n\"But he isn't mine.\"\n\n\"Yes he is;--at any rate, if you like to have him. And of course you\nwill like. Why should you not? He is everything that is nice and\ngood;--and now he is to be the owner of all the property. What I want\nto tell you is this; I do not begrudge it to you.\"\n\nWhy should Clarissa begrudge or not begrudge the property? Mary\nunderstood it all, but nothing had been said entitling her to speak\nas though she understood it. \"I don't think you would begrudge me\nanything that you thought good for me,\" said Mary.\n\n\"And I think that Mr. Ralph Newton,--this Mr. Ralph Newton, is very\ngood for you. Nothing could be so good. In the first place would it\nnot be very nice to have you mistress of Newton Priory? Only that\nshouldn't come properly first.\"\n\n\"And what should come first, Clary?\"\n\n\"Oh,--of course that you should love him better than anything in the\nworld. And you do,--don't you?\"\n\n\"It is too sudden to say that yet, Clary.\"\n\n\"But I am sure you will. Don't you feel that you will? Come, Mary,\nyou should tell me something.\"\n\n\"There is so little to tell.\"\n\n\"Then you are afraid of me. I wanted to tell you everything.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid of you. But, remember, it is hardly more than an\nhour ago since I first heard of Mr. Newton's wishes, and up to that\nmoment nothing was further from my dreams.\"\n\n\"I was sure of it, ever so long ago,\" said Clarissa.\n\n\"Oh, Clary!\"\n\n\"I was. I told Patience how it was to be. I saw it in his eyes. One\ndoes see these things. I knew it would be so; and I told Patience\nthat we three would be three Mrs. Newtons. But that of course was\nnonsense.\"\n\n\"Nonsense, indeed.\"\n\n\"I mean about Patience.\"\n\n\"And what about yourself, Clary?\" Clarissa made no answer, and yet\nshe was burning to tell her own story. She was most anxious to tell\nher own story, but only on the condition of reciprocal confidence.\nThe very nature of her story required that the confidence should be\nreciprocal. \"You said that you wanted to tell me everything,\" said\nMary.\n\n\"And so I do.\"\n\n\"You know how glad I shall be to hear.\"\n\n\"That is all very well, but,--\" And then Clarissa paused.\n\n\"But what, dear?\"\n\n\"You do mean to accept Mr. Newton?\"\n\nNow it was time for Mary to pause. \"If I were to tell you my whole\nheart,\" she said, \"I should be ashamed of what I was saying; and yet\nI do not know that there is any cause for shame.\"\n\n\"There can be none,\" said Clary. \"I am sure of that.\"\n\n\"My acquaintance with Mr. Newton is very, very slight. I liked\nhim,--oh, so much. I thought him to be high-spirited, manly, and a\nfine gentleman. I never saw any man who so much impressed me.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Clarissa, making a gesture as though she\nwould stop on the high road and clasp her hands together, in which,\nhowever, she was impeded by her parasol and her remembrance of her\npresent position.\n\n\"But it is so much to say that one will love a man better than all\nthe world, and go to him, and belong to him, and be his wife.\"\n\n\"Ah;--but if one does love him!\"\n\n\"I can hardly believe that love can grow so quickly.\"\n\n\"Tell the truth, Mary; has it not grown?\"\n\n\"Indeed I cannot say. There; you shall have the whole truth. When he\ncomes to me,--and I suppose he will come.\"\n\n\"There isn't much doubt of that.\"\n\n\"If he does come--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I hardly know what I shall say to him. I shall try to--to love him.\"\n\n\"Of course you will love him,--better than all the world.\"\n\n\"I know that he is paying me the greatest compliment that a man can\npay to a woman. And there is no earthly reason why I should not be\nproud to accept all that he offers me. I have nothing of my own to\nbestow in return.\"\n\n\"But you are so beautiful.\"\n\nMary would make no pretence of denying this. It was true that that\none great feminine possession did belong to her. \"After all,\" she\nsaid, \"how little does beauty signify! It attracts, but it can make\nno man happy. He has everything to give to a wife, and he ought to\nhave much in return for what he gives.\"\n\n\"You don't mean that a girl should refuse a rich man because she has\nno fortune of her own?\"\n\n\"No; not quite that. But she ought to think whether she can be of use\nto him.\"\n\n\"Of course you will be of use, my dear;--of the greatest use in the\nworld. That's his affair, and he is the best judge of what will be of\nuse. You will love him, and other men will envy him, and that will be\neverything. Oh dear, I do so hope he will come soon.\"\n\n\"And I,--I almost hope he will not. I shall be so afraid to see him.\nThe first meeting will be so awful. I shall not dare to look him in\nthe face.\"\n\n\"But it is all settled.\"\n\n\"No;--not settled, Clary.\"\n\n\"Yes; it is settled. And now I will tell you what I mean when I say I\ndo not begrudge him to you. That is--; I do not know whether you will\ncare to be told.\"\n\n\"I care very much, Clary. I should be very unhappy if you did\nbegrudge me anything.\"\n\n\"Of course you know that our Ralph Newton, as we call him, ought to\nhave been the heir.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes.\"\n\n\"I needn't explain it all; only,--only--\"\n\n\"Only he is everything to you. Is it that, Clary?\"\n\n\"Yes; it is that. He is everything to me. I love him--. Oh, yes, I do\nlove him! But, Mary, I am not such a happy girl as you are. Sometimes\nI think he hardly cares for me.\"\n\n\"But he has asked you to care for him?\"\n\n\"Well;--I don't know. I think he has. He has told me, I know, that he\nloved me dearly,--better than any one.\"\n\n\"And what answer did you make to him, Clary?\"\n\nClarissa had the whole scene on the lawn at Popham Villa so clearly\nimpressed upon her memory, that an eternity of years, as she thought,\ncould obliterate no one of its incidents and render doubtful no tone\nof his voice, no word that her lover had spoken. His conduct had at\nthat time been so violent that she had answered him only with tears\nand protestations of undying anger. But her tears had been dried,\nand her anger had passed away;--while the love remained. Ralph, her\nRalph, of course knew well enough that the tears were dry and the\nanger gone. She could understand that he would understand that. But\nthe love which he had protested, if it were real love, would remain.\nAnd why should she doubt him? The very fact that he was so dear to\nher, made such doubts almost disgraceful. And yet there was so much\ncause for doubt. Patience doubted. She knew herself that she feared\nmore than she hoped. She had resolved gallantly that she would be\ntrue to her own heart, even though by such truth she should be\npreparing for herself a life of disappointment. She had admitted\nthe passion, and she would stand by it. In all her fears, too, she\nconsoled herself by the reflection that her lover was hindered,\nnot by want of earnestness or want of truth,--but by the state\nof his affairs. While he was still in debt, striving to save his\ninheritance, but tormented by the growing certainty that it must\npass away from him, how could he give himself up to love-making and\npreparations for marriage? Clary made excuses for him which no one\nelse would have made, and so managed to feed her hopes. \"I made him\nno answer,\" she said at last.\n\n\"And yet you knew you loved him.\"\n\n\"Yes; I knew that. I can tell you, and I told Patience. But I could\nnot tell him.\" She paused a moment thinking whether she could\ndescribe the whole scene; but she found that she could not do that.\n\"I shall tell him, perhaps, when he comes again; that is, if he does\ncome.\"\n\n\"If he loves you he will come.\"\n\n\"I don't know. He has all these troubles on him, and he will be very\npoor;--what will seem to him to be very poor. It would not be poor\nfor me, but for him it would.\"\n\n\"Would that hinder him?\"\n\n\"How can I say? There are so many things a girl cannot know. He\nmay still be in debt, and then he has been brought up to want so\nmuch. But it will make no more difference in me. And now you will\nunderstand why I should tell you that I will never begrudge you your\ngood fortune. If all should come right, you shall give us a little\ncottage near your grand house, and you will not despise us.\" Poor\nClary, when she spoke of her possible future lord, and the little\ncottage on the Newton demesne, hardly understood the feelings with\nwhich a disinherited heir must regard the property which he has lost.\n\n\"Dear, dearest Clary,\" said Mary Bonner, pressing her cousin's arm.\n\nThey had now reached Mrs. Brownlow's house, and the old lady was\ndelighted to receive them. Of course she began to discuss at once the\ngreat news. Sir Thomas had had his arm broken, and was now again a\nmember of Parliament. Mrs. Brownlow was a thorough-going Tory, and\nwas in an ecstasy of delight that her old friend should have been\nsuccessful. The success seemed to be so much the greater in that the\nhero had suffered a broken bone. And then there were many questions\nto be asked? Would Sir Thomas again be Solicitor-General by right\nof his seat in Parliament?--for on such matters Mrs. Brownlow was\nrather hazy in her conceptions as to the working of the British\nConstitution. And would he live at home? Clarissa would not say that\nshe and Patience expected such a result. All that she could suggest\nof comfort on this matter was that there would be now something of\na fair cause for excusing their father's residence at his London\nchambers.\n\nBut there was a subject more enticing to the old lady even than\nSir Thomas's triumphs; a subject as to which there could not be\nany triumph,--only dismay; but not, on that account, the less\ninteresting. Ralph Newton had sold his inheritance. \"I believe it is\nall settled,\" said Clarissa, demurely.\n\n\"Dear, dear, dear, dear!\" groaned the old lady. And while she groaned\nClarissa furtively cast a smile upon her cousin. \"It is the saddest\nthing I ever knew,\" said Mrs. Brownlow. \"And, after all, for a young\nman who never can be anybody, you know.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" said Clarissa, \"he can be somebody.\"\n\n\"You know what I mean, my dear. I think it very shocking, and very\nwrong. Such a fine estate, too!\"\n\n\"We all like Mr. Newton very much indeed,\" said Clarissa. \"Papa\nthinks he is a most charming young man. I never knew papa taken with\nany one so much. And so do we all,--Patience and I,--and Mary.\"\n\n\"But, my dear,\" began Mrs. Brownlow,--Mrs. Brownlow had always\nthought that Ralph the heir would ultimately marry Clarissa\nUnderwood, and that it was a manifest duty on his part to do so. She\nhad fancied that Clarissa had expected it herself, and had believed\nthat all the Underwoods would be broken-hearted at this transfer\nof the estate. \"I don't think it can be right,\" said Mrs. Brownlow;\n\"and I must say that it seems to me that old Mr. Newton ought to be\nashamed of himself. Just because this young man happens to be, in a\nsort of a way, his own son, he is going to destroy the whole family.\nI think that it is very wicked.\" But she had not a word of censure\nfor the heir who had consumed his mess of pottage.\n\n\"Wasn't she grand?\" said Clary, as soon as they were out again upon\nthe road. \"She is such a dear old woman, but she doesn't understand\nanything. I couldn't help giving you a look when she was abusing\nour friend. When she knows it all, she'll have to make you such an\napology.\"\n\n\"I hope she will not do that.\"\n\n\"She will if she does not forget all about it. She does forget\nthings. There is one thing I don't agree with her in at all. I don't\nsee any shame in your Ralph having the property; and, as to his being\nnobody, that is all nonsense. He would be somebody, wherever he went,\nif he had not an acre of property. He will be Mr. Newton, of Newton\nPriory, just as much as anybody else could be. He has never done\nanything wrong.\" To all which Mary Bonner had very little to say. She\ncertainly was not prepared to blame the present Squire for having so\nmanaged his affairs as to be able to leave the estate to his own son.\n\nThe two girls were very energetic, and walked back the whole way to\nPopham Villa, regardless of a dozen omnibuses that passed them. \"I\ntold her all about our Ralph,--my Ralph,\"--said Clary to her sister\nafterward. \"I could not help telling her now.\"\n\n\"Dear Clary,\" said Patience, \"I wish you could help thinking of it\nalways.\"\n\n\"That's quite impossible,\" said Clarissa, cheerily.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\n\nALONE IN THE HOUSE.\n\n\nYoung Newton at last found himself alone in the house at Newton\nPriory after his father's death. He had sent George Morris away,\nbecoming very stern in his demand to be left to his solitude as long\nas opposition was made to him. Gregory had come down to him from the\nparsonage, and had also been dismissed. \"Your brother will be here\nprobably to-day,\" said Ralph, \"and then I will send for you.\"\n\n\"I am thinking more of you than of my brother, just now,\" answered\nthe parson.\n\n\"Yes, I know,--and though I cannot talk to you, I know how good you\nare. I want to see nobody but him. I shall be better alone.\" Then\nGregory had returned to the parsonage.\n\nAs soon as Ralph was alone he crept up to the room in which his\nfather's body was lying, and stood silently by the bedside for above\nan hour. He was struggling to remember the loss he had had in the\nman, and to forget the loss in wealth and station. No father had ever\nbeen better to a son than his father had been to him. In every affair\nof life his happiness, his prosperity, and his future condition had\ngiven motives to his father's conduct. No lover ever worshipped a\nmistress more thoroughly than his father had idolised him. There\nhad never been love to beat it, never solicitude more perfect and\ndevoted. And yet, as he had been driven home that day, he had allowed\nhis mind to revert to the property, and his regrets to settle\nthemselves on his lost position. It should not be so any longer. He\ncould not keep his mind from dwelling on the thing, but he would\nthink of it as a trifle,--as of a thing which he could afford to lose\nwithout sorrow. Whereas he had also lost that which is of all things\nthe most valuable and most impossible to replace,--a friend whose\nlove was perfect.\n\nBut then there was another loss. He bitterly blamed himself for\nhaving written that letter to Sir Thomas Underwood, before he was\nactually in a position to do as he had proposed. It must all be\nunwritten now. Every resolution hitherto taken as to his future life\nmust be abandoned. He must begin again, and plan a new life for\nhimself. It had all come upon him so suddenly that he was utterly\nat a loss to think what he would do with himself or with his days.\nThere was nothing for him but to go away, and be utterly without\noccupation, altogether without friends. Friends, indeed, he\nhad,--dear, intimate, loving friends. Gregory Newton and George\nMorris were his friends. Every tenant on the Newton property was his\nfriend. There was not a man riding with the hunt, worth having as a\nfriend, who was not on friendly terms with him. But all these he must\nleave altogether. In whatever spot he might find for himself a future\nresidence, that spot could not be at Peele Newton. After what had\noccurred he could not remain there, now that he was not the heir. And\nthen, again, his thoughts came back from his lost father to his lost\ninheritance, and he was very wretched.\n\nBetween three and four o'clock he took his hat and walked out. He\nsauntered down along a small stream, which, after running through the\ngardens, bordered one of the coverts which came up near to the house.\nHe took this path because he knew that he would be alone there,\nunseen. It had occurred to him already that it would be well that he\nshould give orders to stop the works which his father had commenced,\nand there had been a moment in which he had almost told one of the\nservants in the house to do so. But he had felt ashamed at seeming to\nremember so small a thing. The owner would be there soon, probably\nin an hour or two, and could stop or could continue what he pleased.\nThen, as he thought of the ownership of the estate, he reflected\nthat, as the sale had been in truth effected by his namesake, the\nmoney promised by his father would be legally due;--would not now be\nhis money. As to the estate itself, that, of course, would go to his\nnamesake as his father's heir. No will had been made leaving the\nestate to him, and his namesake would be the heir-at-law. Thus he\nwould be utterly beggared. It was not that he actually believed that\nthis would be the case; but his thoughts were morbid, and he took an\nunwholesome delight in picturing to himself circumstances in their\nblackest hue. Then he would strike the ground with his stick, in his\nwrath, because he thought of such things at all. How was it that he\nwas base enough to think of them while the accident, which had robbed\nhim of his father, was so recent?\n\nAs the dusk grew on, he emerged out of the copse into the park, and,\ncrossing at the back of the home paddocks, came out upon the road\nnear to Darvell's farm. He passed a few yards up the lane, till at a\nturn he could discern the dismantled house. As far as he could see\nthrough the gloom of the evening, there were no workmen near the\nplace. Some one, he presumed, had given directions that nothing\nfurther should be done on a day so sad as this. He stood for awhile\nlooking and listening, and then turned round to enter the park again.\n\nIt might be that the new squire was already at the house, and it\nwould be thought that he ought not to be absent. The road from the\nstation to the Priory was not that on which he was standing, and\nRalph might have arrived without his knowledge. He wandered slowly\nback, but, before he could turn in at the park-gate, he was met by\na man on the road. It was Mr. Walker, the farmer of Brownriggs, an\nold man over seventy, who had lived on the property all his life,\nsucceeding his father in the same farm. Walker had known young Newton\nsince he had first been brought to the Priory as a boy, and could\nspeak to him with more freedom than perhaps any other tenant on the\nestate. \"Oh, Mr. Ralph,\" he said, \"this has been a dreary thing!\"\nRalph, for the first time since the accident, burst out into a flood\nof tears. \"No wonder you take on, Mr. Ralph. He was a good father to\nyou, and a fine gentleman, and one we all respected.\" Ralph still\nsobbed, but put his hand on the old man's arm and leaned upon him.\n\"I hope, Mr. Ralph, that things was pretty well settled about the\nproperty.\" Ralph shook his head, but did not speak. \"A bargain is a\nbargain, Mr. Ralph, and I suppose that this bargain was made. The\nlawyers would know that it had been made.\"\n\n\"It don't matter about that, Mr. Walker,\" said Ralph; \"but the estate\nwould go to my father's nephew as his heir.\" The farmer started as\nthough he had been shot. \"You will have another landlord, Mr. Walker.\nHe can hardly be better than the one you have lost.\"\n\n\"Then, Mr. Ralph, you must bear it manly.\"\n\n\"I think that I can say that I will do that. It is not for the\nproperty that I am crying. I hope you don't think that of me, Mr.\nWalker.\"\n\n\n[Illustration: \"It is not for the property that I am crying.\"]\n\n\n\"No, no, no.\"\n\n\"I can bear that;--though it is hard the having to go away and live\namong strange people. I think I shall get a farm somewhere, and see\nif I can take a lesson from you. I don't know anything else that I\ncan do.\"\n\n\"You could have the Mordykes, Mr. Ralph,\" said Mr. Walker, naming a\nholding on the Newton property as to which there were rumours that it\nwould soon be vacant.\n\n\"No, Mr. Walker, it mustn't be here. I couldn't stand that. I must\ngo away from this,--God knows where. I must go away from this, and I\nshall never see the old place again!\"\n\n\"Bear it manly, Mr. Ralph,\" said the farmer.\n\n\"I think I shall, after a bit. Good evening, Mr. Walker. I expect my\nfather's nephew every hour, and I ought to be up at the house when he\ncomes. I shall see you again before I go.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; that's for certain,\" said the farmer. They were both\nthinking of the day on which they would follow the old Squire to his\ngrave in Newton Peele churchyard.\n\nRalph re-entered the park, and hurried across to the house as though\nhe were afraid that he would be too late to receive the heir; but\nthere had been no arrival, nor had there come any message from the\nother Ralph. Indeed up to this hour the news had not reached the\npresent owner of Newton Priory. The telegram had been duly delivered\nat the Moonbeam, where the fortunate youth was staying; but he was\nhunting on this day, riding the new horse which he had bought from\nMr. Pepper, and, up to this moment, did not know anything of that\nwhich chance had done for him. Nor did he get back to the Moonbeam\ntill late at night, having made some engagement for dinner after the\nday's sport. It was not till noon on the following day, the Friday,\nthat a message was received from him at the Priory, saying that he\nwould at once hurry down to Hampshire.\n\nRalph sat down to dinner all alone. Let what will happen to break\nhearts and ruin fortunes, dinner comes as long as the means last for\nproviding it. The old butler waited upon him in absolute silence,\nfearing to speak a word, lest the word at such a time should be\nill-spoken. No doubt the old man was thinking of the probable\nexpedience of his retiring upon his savings; feeling, however, that\nit became him to show, till the last, every respect to all who bore\nthe honoured name of Newton. When the meat had been eaten, the\nold servant did say a word. \"Won't you come round to the fire, Mr.\nRalph?\" and he placed comfortably before the hearth one of the heavy\narm-chairs with which the corners of the broad fire-place were\nflanked. But Ralph only shook his head, and muttered some refusal.\nThere he sat, square to the table, with the customary bottle of wine\nbefore him, leaning back with his hands in his pockets, thinking of\nhis condition in life. The loneliness of the room, the loneliness\nof the house, were horrible to him. And yet he would not that his\nsolitude should be interrupted. He had been so sitting, motionless,\nalmost overcome by the gloom of the big dark room, for so long a\nperiod that he hardly knew whether it was night or not, when a note\nwas brought to him from Gregory. \"Dear Ralph,--Shall I not come down\nto you for an hour?--G. N.\" He read the note, and sent back a verbal\nmessage. \"Tell Mr. Gregory that I had rather not.\" And so he sat\nmotionless till the night had really come, till the old butler\nbrought him his candlestick and absolutely bade him betake himself\nto bed. He had watched during the whole of the previous night, and\nnow had slumbered in his chair from time to time. But his sleeping\nhad been of that painful, wakeful nature which brings with it no\nrefreshment. It had been full of dreams, in all of which there had\nbeen some grotesque reference to the property, but in none of them\nhad there been any memory of the Squire's terrible death. And yet, as\nhe woke and woke and woke again, it can hardly be said that the truth\nhad come back upon him as a new blow. Through such dreams there seems\nto exist a double memory, and a second identity. The misery of his\nisolated position never for a moment left him; and yet there were\nrepeated to him over and over again those bungling, ill-arranged,\nimpossible pictures of trivial transactions about the place, which\nthe slumber of a few seconds sufficed to create in his brain. \"Mr.\nRalph, you must go to bed;--you must indeed, sir,\" said the old\nbutler, standing over him with a candle during one of these fitful\ndreamings.\n\n\"Yes, Grey;--yes, I will; directly. Put it down. Thank you. Don't\nmind sitting up,\" said Ralph, rousing himself in his chair.\n\n\"It's past twelve,\" Mr. Ralph.\n\n\"You can go to bed, you know, Grey.\"\n\n\"No, sir;--no. I'll see you to bed first. It'll be better so. Why,\nMr. Ralph, the fire's all out, and you're sitting here perished. You\nwasn't in bed last night, and you ought to be there now. Come, Mr.\nRalph.\"\n\nThen Ralph rose from his chair and took the candlestick. It was true\nenough that he had better be in bed. As he shook himself, he felt\nthat he had never been so cold in his life. And then as he moved\nthere came upon him that terrible feeling that everything was amiss\nwith him, that there was no consolation on any side. \"That'll do,\nGrey; good night,\" he said, as the old man prepared to follow him\nup-stairs. But Grey was not to be shaken off. \"I'll just see you to\nyour room, Mr. Ralph.\" He wanted to accompany his young master past\nthe door of that chamber in which was lying all that remained of the\nold master. But Ralph would open the door. \"Not to-night, Mr. Ralph,\"\nsaid Grey. But Ralph persisted, and stood again by the bedside. \"He\nwould have given me his flesh and blood;--his very life,\" said Ralph\nto the butler. \"I think no father ever so loved a son. And yet, what\nhas it come to?\" Then he stooped down, and put his lips to the cold\nclay-blue forehead.\n\n\"It ain't come to much surely,\" said old Grey to himself as he crept\naway to his own room; \"and I don't suppose it do come to much mostly\nwhen folks go wrong.\"\n\nRalph was out again before breakfast, wandering up and down the banks\nof the stream where the wood hid him, and then he made up his mind\nthat he would at once write again to Sir Thomas Underwood. He must\nimmediately make it understood that that suggestion which he had\nmade in his ill-assumed pride of position must be abandoned. He\nhad nothing now to offer to that queenly princess worthy of the\nacceptance of any woman. He was a base-born son, about to be turned\nout of his father's house because of the disgrace of his birth. In\nthe eye of the law he was nobody. The law allowed to him not even a\nname;--certainly allowed to him the possession of no relative; denied\nto him the possibility of any family tie. His father had succeeded\nwithin an ace of giving him that which would have created for him\nfamily ties, relatives, name and all. The old Squire had understood\nwell how to supersede the law, and to make the harshness of man's\nenactments of no avail. Had the Squire quite succeeded, the son would\nhave stood his ground, would have called himself Newton of Newton,\nand nobody would have dared to tell him that he was a nameless\nbastard. But now he could not even wait to be told. He must tell it\nhimself, and must vanish. He had failed to understand it all while\nhis father was struggling and was yet alive; but he understood it\nwell now. So he came in to his breakfast, resolved that he would\nwrite that letter at once.\n\nAnd then there were orders to be given;--hideous orders. And there\nwas that hideous remembrance that legally he was entitled to give no\norders. Gregory came down to him as he sat at breakfast, making his\nway into the parlour without excuse. \"My brother cannot have been at\nhome at either place,\" he said.\n\n\"Perhaps not,\" said Ralph. \"I suppose not.\"\n\n\"The message will be sent after him, and you will hear to-day no\ndoubt.\"\n\n\"I suppose I shall,\" said Ralph.\n\nThen Gregory in a low voice made the suggestion in reference to which\nhe had come across from the parsonage. \"I think that perhaps I and\nLarkin had better go over to Basingstoke.\" Larkin was the steward.\nRalph again burst out into tears, but he assented; and in this way\nthose hideous orders were given.\n\nAs soon as Gregory was gone he took himself to his desk, and did\nwrite to Sir Thomas Underwood. His letter, which was perhaps somewhat\ntoo punctilious, ran as follows:--\n\n\n   Newton Priory, 4th November, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR SIR,--\n\n   I do not know whether you will have heard before this of\n   the accident which has made me fatherless. The day before\n   yesterday my father was killed by a fall from his horse in\n   the hunting-field. I should not have ventured to trouble\n   you with a letter on this subject, nor should I myself\n   have been disposed to write about it at present, were\n   it not that I feel it to be an imperative duty to refer\n   without delay to my last letter to you, and to your very\n   flattering reply. When I wrote to you it was true that\n   my father had made arrangements for purchasing on my\n   behalf the reversion to the property. That it was so you\n   doubtless were aware from your own personal knowledge\n   of the affairs of Mr. Ralph Newton. Whether that sale\n   was or was not legally completed I do not know. Probably\n   not;--and in regard to my own interests it is to be hoped\n   that it was not completed. But in any event the whole\n   Newton property will pass to your late ward, as my father\n   certainly made no such will as would convey it to me even\n   if the sale were complete.\n\n   It is a sad time for explaining all this, when the body of\n   my poor father is still lying unburied in the house, and\n   when, as you may imagine, I am ill-fitted to think of\n   matters of business; but, after what has passed between\n   us, I conceive myself bound to explain to you that I wrote\n   my last letter under a false impression, and that I can\n   make no such claim to Miss Bonner's favour as I then set\n   up. I am houseless and nameless, and for aught I yet know\n   to the contrary, absolutely penniless. The blow has hit\n   me very hard. I have lost my fortune, which I can bear;\n   I have lost whatever chance I had of gaining your niece's\n   hand, which I must learn to bear; and I have lost the\n   kindest father a man ever had,--which is unbearable.\n\n   Yours very faithfully,\n\n   RALPH NEWTON (so called).\n\n\nIf it be thought that there was something in the letter which should\nhave been suppressed,--the allusion, for instance, to the possible\nbut most improbable loss of his father's private means, and his\nmorbid denial of his own right to a name which he had always borne,\na right which no one would deny him,--it must be remembered that\nthe circumstances of the hour bore very heavily on him, and that it\nwas hardly possible that he should not nurse the grievance which\nafflicted him. Had he not been alone in these hours he might have\ncarried himself more bravely. As it was, he struggled hard to carry\nhimself well. If no one had ever been told how nearly successful the\nSquire had been in his struggle to gain the power of leaving the\nestate to his son, had there been nothing of the triumph of victory,\nhe could have left the house in which he had lived and the position\nwhich he had filled almost without sorrow,--certainly without\nlamentation. In the midst of calamities caused by the loss of\nfortune, it is the knowledge of what the world will say that breaks\nus down;--not regret for those enjoyments which wealth can give, and\nwhich had been long anticipated.\n\nAt two o'clock on this day he got a telegram. \"I will be at the\nparsonage this evening, and will come down at once.\" Ralph the heir,\non his return home late at night, had heard the news, and early on\nthe following morning had communicated with his brother and with\nhis namesake. In the afternoon, after his return from Basingstoke,\nGregory again came down to the house, desiring to know whether Ralph\nwould prefer that the meeting should be at the Priory or at the\nparsonage, and on this occasion his cousin bore with him. \"Why should\nnot your brother come to his own house?\" asked Ralph.\n\n\"I suppose he feels that he should not claim it as his own.\"\n\n\"That is nonsense. It is his own, and he knows it. Does he think that\nI am likely to raise any question against his right?\"\n\n\"I do not suppose that my brother has ever looked at the matter in\nthat light,\" said the parson. \"He is the last man in the world to do\nso. For the present, at any rate, you are living here and he is not.\nIn such an emergency, perhaps, he feels that it would be better that\nhe should come to his brother than intrude here.\"\n\n\"It would be no intrusion. I should wish him to feel that I am\nprepared to yield to him instantly. Of course the house cannot be\nvery pleasant for him as yet. He must suffer something of the misery\nof the occasion before he can enjoy his inheritance. But it will only\nbe for a day or so.\"\n\n\"Dear Ralph,\" said the parson, \"I think you somewhat wrong my\nbrother.\"\n\n\"I endeavour not to do so. I think no ill of him, because I presume\nhe should look for enjoyment from what is certainly his own. He\nand my father were not friends, and this, which has been to me so\nterrible a calamity in every way, cannot affect him with serious\nsorrow. I shall meet him as a friend; but I would sooner meet him\nhere than at the parsonage.\"\n\nIt was at last settled that the two brothers should come down to\nthe great house,--both Ralph the heir, and Gregory the parson; and\nthat the three young men should remain there, at any rate, till the\nfuneral was over. And when this was arranged, the two who had really\nbeen fast friends for so many years, were able to talk to each other\nin true friendship. The solitude which he had endured had been almost\ntoo much for the one who had been made so desolate; but at last,\nwarmed by the comfort of companionship, he resumed his manhood,\nand was able to look his affairs in the face, free from the morbid\nfeeling which had oppressed him. Gregory had his own things brought\ndown from the parsonage, and in order that there might be no\nhesitation on his brother's part, sent a servant with a note to the\nstation desiring his brother to come at once to the Priory. They\nresolved to wait dinner for him till after the arrival of a train\nleaving London at five P.M. By that train the heir came, and between\nseven and eight he entered the house which he had not seen since he\nwas a boy, and which was now his own.\n\nThe receipt of the telegram at the Moonbeam had affected Ralph, who\nwas now in truth the Squire, with absolute awe. He had returned late\nfrom a somewhat jovial dinner, in company with his friend Cox, who\nwas indeed more jovial than was becoming. Ralph was not given to\ndrinking more wine than he could carry decently; but his friend, who\nwas determined to crowd as much enjoyment of life as was possible\ninto the small time allowed him before his disappearance from the\nworld that had known him, was noisy and rollicking. Perhaps it may\nbe acknowledged in plain terms that he was tipsy. They both entered\ntogether the sitting-room which Ralph used, and Cox was already\ncalling for brandy and water, when the telegram was handed to Newton.\nHe read it twice before he understood it. His uncle dead!--suddenly\ndead! And the inheritance all his own! In doing him justice, however,\nwe must admit that he did not at the time admit this to be the case.\nHe did perceive that there must arise some question; but his first\nfeeling, as regarded the property, was one of intense remorse that he\nshould have sold his rights at a moment in which they would so soon\nhave been realised in his own favour. But the awe which struck him\nwas occasioned by the suddenness of the blow which had fallen upon\nhis uncle. \"What's up now, old fellow?\" hiccupped Mr. Cox.\n\nI wonder whether any polite reader, into whose hands this story\nmay fall, may ever have possessed a drunken friend, and have been\nstruck by some solemn incident at the moment in which his friend\nis exercising the privileges of intoxication. The effect is not\npleasant, nor conducive of good-humour. Ralph turned away in disgust,\nand leaned upon the chimney-piece, trying to think of what had\noccurred to him. \"What ish it, old chap? Shomebody wants shome tin?\nI'll stand to you, old fellow.\"\n\n\"Take him away,\" said Ralph. \"He's drunk.\" Then, without waiting for\nfurther remonstrance from the good-natured but now indignant Cox, he\nwent off to his own room.\n\nOn the following morning he started for London by an early train, and\nby noon was with his lawyer. Up to that moment he believed that he\nhad lost his inheritance. When he sent those two telegrams to his\nbrother and to his namesake, he hardly doubted but that the entire\nproperty now belonged to his uncle's son. The idea had never occurred\nto him that, even were the sale complete, he might still inherit the\nproperty as his uncle's heir-at-law,--and that he would do so unless\nhis uncle had already bequeathed it to his son. But the attorney soon\nput him right. The sale had not been yet made. He, Ralph, had not\nsigned a single legal document to that effect. He had done nothing\nwhich would have enabled his late uncle to make a will leaving the\nNewton estate to his son. \"The letters which have been written are\nall waste-paper,\" said the lawyer. \"Even if they were to be taken\nas binding as agreements for a covenant, they would operate against\nyour cousin,--not in his favour. In such case you would demand the\nspecified price and still inherit.\"\n\n\"That is out of the question,\" said the heir. \"Quite out of the\nquestion,\" said the attorney. \"No doubt Mr. Newton left a will,\nand under it his son will take whatever property the father had to\nleave.\"\n\nAnd so Ralph the heir found himself to be the owner of it all just\nat the moment in which he thought that he had lost all chance of the\ninheritance as the result of his own folly. When he walked out of the\nlawyer's office he was almost wild with amazement. This was the prize\nto which he had been taught to look forward through all his boyish\ndays, and all his early manhood;--but to look forward to it, as a\nthing that must be very distant, so distant as almost to be lost in\nthe vagueness of the prospect. Probably his youth would have clean\npassed from him, and he would have entered upon the downhill course\nof what is called middle life before his inheritance would come to\nhim. He had been unable to wait, and had wasted everything,--nearly\neverything; had, at any rate, ruined all his hopes before he was\nseven-and-twenty; and yet, now, at seven-and-twenty, it was, as his\nlawyer assured him, all his own. How nearly had he lost it all! How\nnearly had he married the breeches-maker's daughter! How close upon\nthe rocks he had been. But now all was his own, and he was in truth\nNewton of Newton, with no embarrassments of any kind which could\nimpose a feather's weight upon his back.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV.\n\n\"SHE'LL ACCEPT YOU, OF COURSE.\"\n\n\nWe will pass over the solemn sadness of the funeral at Newton and\nthe subsequent reading of the old Squire's will. As to the latter,\nthe will was as it had been made some six or seven years ago. The\nSquire had simply left all that he possessed to his illegitimate\nson Ralph Newton. There was no difficulty about the will. Nor was\nthere any difficulty about the estate. The two lawyers came down to\nthe funeral. Sir Thomas Underwood would have come but that he was\nprevented by the state of his arm. A statement showing all that had\nbeen done in the matter was prepared for him, but it was agreed on\nall sides that the sale had not been made, and that the legitimate\nheir must succeed to the property. No one was disposed to dispute the\ndecision. The Squire's son had never for a moment supposed that he\ncould claim the estate. Nor did Ralph the heir suppose for a moment\nthat he could surrender it after the explanation which he had\nreceived from the lawyer in London.\n\nThe funeral was over, and the will had been read, and at the end\nof November the three young men were still living together in the\ngreat house at Newton. The heir had gone up to London once or twice,\ninstigated by the necessity of the now not difficult task of raising\na little ready money. He must at once pay off all his debts. He\nmust especially pay that which he owed to Mr. Neefit; and he must\ndo so with many expressions of his gratitude,--perhaps with some\nexpressions of polite regret at the hardness of Polly's heart towards\nhim. But he must do so certainly without any further entreaty that\nPolly's heart might be softened. Ah,--with what marvellous good\nfortune had he escaped from that pitfall! For how much had he not to\nbe thankful to some favouring goddess who must surely have watched\nover him from his birth! From what shipwrecks had he not escaped! And\nnow he was Squire of Newton, with wealth and all luxuries at command,\nhampered with no wife, oppressed by no debts, free from all cares. As\nhe thought of his perfect freedom in these respects, he remembered\nhis former resolution as to Mary Bonner. That resolution he would\ncarry out. It would be well for him now to marry a wife, and of\nall the women he had ever seen Mary Bonner was certainly the most\nbeautiful. With Newton all his own, with such a string of horses as\nhe would soon possess, and with such a wife at the head of his table,\nwhom need he envy, and how many were there who would not envy him?\n\nThroughout November he allowed his horses to remain at the Moonbeam,\nbeing somewhat in doubt whether or no he would return to that\nfascinating hostelrie. He received one or two most respectful letters\nfrom Mr. Horsball, in which glowing accounts were given of the sport\nof the season, and the health of his horses, and offers made of most\ndisinterested services. Rooms should be ready for him at a moment's\nnotice if he liked at any time to run over for a week's hunting. It\nwas quite evident that in the eyes of Mr. Horsball Newton of Newton\nwas a great man. And there came congratulations from Mr. Cox, in\nwhich no allusion whatever was made to the Squire's somewhat uncivil\nconduct at their last meeting. Mr. Cox trusted that his dearest\nfriend would come over and have another spell at the Moonbeam before\nhe settled down for life;--and then hinted in language that was\nreally delicate in the niceness of its expression, that if he, Cox,\nwere but invited to spend a week or two at Newton Priory before he\nbanished himself for life to Australia, he would be able to make\nhis way over the briny deep with a light heart and an uncomplaining\ntongue. \"You know, old fellow, how true I've always been to you,\"\nwrote Cox, in language of the purest friendship. \"As true as\nsteel,--to sausages in the morning and brandy and soda at night,\"\nsaid Ralph to himself as he read this.\n\nHe behaved with thorough kindness to his cousin. The three men lived\ntogether for a month, and their intercourse was as pleasant as was\npossible under the circumstances. Of course there was no hunting\nduring this month at Newton. Nor indeed did the heir see a hound till\nDecember, although, as the reader is aware, he was not particularly\nbound to revere his uncle's memory. He made many overtures to his\nnamesake. He would be only too happy if his cousin,--he always called\nthe Squire's son his cousin,--would make Newton his home for the\nnext twelvemonth. It was found that the Squire had left behind him\nsomething like forty thousand pounds, so that the son was by no means\nto be regarded as a poor man. It was his idea at present that he\nwould purchase in some pleasant county as much land as he might\nfarm himself, and there set up his staff for life. \"And get about\ntwo-and-a-half per cent. for your money,\" said the heir, who was\nbeginning to consider himself learned in such matters, and could talk\nof land as a very serious thing in the way of a possession.\n\n\"What else am I to do?\" said the other. \"Two-and-a-half per cent.\nwith an occupation is better than five per cent. with none. I should\nmake out the remainder, too, by farming the land myself. There is\nnothing else in the world that I could do.\"\n\nAs for remaining twelve months at Newton, that was of course out of\nthe question. Nevertheless, when December came he was still living in\nthe house, and had consented to remain there till Christmas should\nhave passed. He had already heard of a farm in Norfolk. \"The worst\ncounty for hunting in England,\" the heir had said. \"Then I must try\nand live without hunting,\" said Ralph who was not the heir. During\nall this time not a horse was sent to the meet from the Newton\nstables. The owner of Newton was contented to see the animals\nexercised in the park, and to amuse himself by schooling them over\nhurdles, and by high jumping at the bar.\n\nDuring the past month the young Squire had received various letters\nfrom Sir Thomas Underwood, and the other Ralph had received one. With\nSir Thomas's caution, advice, and explanations to his former ward,\nthe story has no immediate concern; but his letter to him who was to\nhave been Mary Bonner's suitor may concern us more nearly. It was\nvery short, and the reader shall have it entire.\n\n\n   Popham Villa, 10th November, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR MR. NEWTON,--\n\n   I have delayed answering your letter for a day or two\n   in order that it may not disturb you till the last\n   sad ceremony be over. I do not presume to offer you\n   consolation in your great sorrow. Such tenders should only\n   be made by the nearest and the dearest. Perhaps you will\n   permit me to say that what little I have seen of you and\n   what further I have heard of you assure to you my most\n   perfect sympathy.\n\n   On that other matter which gave occasion for your two\n   letters to me I shall best perhaps discharge my duty by\n   telling you that I showed them both to my niece; and that\n   she feels, as do I, that they are both honourable to you,\n   and of a nature to confer honour upon her. The change\n   in your position, which I acknowledge to be most severe,\n   undoubtedly releases you, as it would have released\n   her,--had she been bound and chose to accept such release.\n\n   Whenever you may be in this neighbourhood we shall be\n   happy to see you.\n\n   The state of my arm still prevents me from writing with\n   ease.\n\n   Yours very faithfully,\n\n   THOMAS UNDERWOOD.\n\n\nNewton, when he received this letter, struggled hard to give to it\nits proper significance, but he could bring himself to no conclusion\nrespecting it. Sir Thomas had acknowledged that he was released,--and\nthat Mary Bonner would also have been released had she placed herself\nunder any obligation; but Sir Thomas did not say a word from which\nhis correspondent might gather whether in his present circumstances\nhe might still be regarded as an acceptable suitor. The letter was\nmost civil, most courteous, almost cordial in its expression of\nsympathy; but yet it did not contain a word of encouragement. It may\nbe said that the suitor had himself so written to the lady's uncle,\nas to place himself out of the way of all further encouragement;--as\nto have put it beyond the power of his correspondent to write a word\nto him that should have in it any comfort. Certainly he had done so.\nHe had clearly shown in his second letter that he had abandoned all\nidea of making the match as to which he had shown so much urgent\ndesire in his first letter. He had explained that the marriage would\nnow be impossible, and had spoken of himself as a ruined, broken man,\nall whose hopes were shipwrecked. Sir Thomas could hardly have told\nhim in reply that Mary Bonner would still be pleased to see him. And\nyet Mary Bonner had almost said so. She had been very silent when the\nletter was read to her. The news of Mr. Newton's death had already\nreached the family at Popham Villa, and had struck them all with awe.\nHow it might affect the property even Sir Thomas had not absolutely\nknown at first; though he was not slow to make it understood that in\nall probability this terrible accident would be ruinous to the hopes\nwhich his niece had been justified in entertaining. At that hour Mary\nhad spoken not a word;--nor could she be induced to speak respecting\nit either by Patience or Clarissa. Even to them she could not bring\nherself to say that if the man really loved her he would still\ncome to her and say so. There was a feeling of awe upon her which\nmade her mute, and stern, and altogether unplastic in the hands\nof her friends. It seemed even to Patience that Mary was struck\nby a stunning sorrow at the ruin which had come upon her lover's\nprospects. But it was not so at all. The thought wronged her utterly.\nWhat stunned her was this,--that she could not bring herself to\nexpress a passion for a man whom she had seen so seldom, with whom\nher conversation had been so slight, from whom personally she had\nreceived no overtures of attachment,--even though he were ruined. She\ncould not bring herself to express such a passion;--but yet it was\nthere. When Clarissa thought that she might obtain if not a word, at\nleast a tear, Mary appeared to be dead to all feeling, though crushed\nby what she had lost. She was thinking the while whether it might be\npossible for such a one as her to send to the man and to tell him\nthat that which had now occurred had of a sudden made him really dear\nto her. Thoughts of maiden boldness flitted across her mind, but she\ncould not communicate them even to the girls who were her friends.\nYet in silence and in solitude she resolved that the time should come\nin which she would be bold.\n\nThen young Newton's second letter reached the house, and that also\nhad been read to her. \"He is quite right,\" said Sir Thomas. \"Of\ncourse it releases both of you.\"\n\n\"There was nothing to release,\" said Mary, proudly.\n\n\"I mean to say that having made such a proposition as was contained\nin his first letter, he was bound to explain his altered position.\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" said Mary.\n\n\"Of course he was. He had made his offer believing that he could make\nyou mistress of Newton Priory,--and he had made it thinking that he\nhimself could marry in that position. And he would have been in that\nposition had not this most unforeseen and terrible calamity have\noccurred.\"\n\n\"I do not see that it makes any difference,\" said Mary, in a whisper.\n\n\"What do you mean, my dear?\"\n\n\"I hardly know, uncle.\"\n\n\"Try to explain yourself, Mary.\"\n\n\"If I had accepted any man when he was rich, I should not go back\nwhen he was poor,--unless he wanted it.\" This also she said in a\nwhisper.\n\n\"But you had not accepted him.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mary, still in a whisper. Sir Thomas, who was perhaps not\nvery good at such things, did not understand the working of her mind.\nBut had she dared, she would have asked her uncle to tell Mr. Newton\nto come and see her. Sir Thomas, having some dim inkling of what\nperhaps might be the case, did add a paragraph to his letter in which\nhe notified to his correspondent that a personal visit would be taken\nin good part.\n\nBy the end of the first week in December things were beginning to\nsettle into shape at the Priory. The three young men were still\nliving together at the great house, and the tenants on the estate had\nbeen taught to recognise the fact that Ralph, who had ever been the\nheir, was in truth the owner. Among the labourers and poorer classes\nthere was no doubt much regret, and that regret was expressed. The\ntenants, though they all liked the Squire's son, were not upon the\nwhole ill-pleased. It was in proper conformity with English habits\nand English feelings that the real heir should reign. Among the\ngentry the young Squire was made as welcome as the circumstances of\nthe heir would admit. According to their way of thinking, personally\npopular as was the other man, it was clearly better that a legitimate\ndescendant of the old family should be installed at Newton Priory.\nThe old Squire's son rode well to hounds, and was loved by all; but\nnothing that all the world could do on his behalf would make him\nNewton of Newton. If only he would remain in the neighbourhood and\ntake some place suited to his income, every house would be open\nto him. He would be received with no diminution of attachment or\nrespect. Overtures of this nature were made to him. This house could\nbe had for him, and that farm could be made comfortable. He might\nlive among them as a general favourite; but he could not under any\ncircumstances have been,--Newton of Newton. Nothing, however, was\nclearer to himself than this;--that as he could not remain in the\ncounty as the master of Newton Priory, he would not remain in the\ncounty at all.\n\nAs things settled down and took shape he began to feel that even\nin his present condition he might possibly make himself acceptable\nto such a girl as Mary Bonner. In respect of fortune there could\nbe no reason whatever why he should not offer her his hand. He\nwas in truth a rich man, whereas she had nothing, By birth he was\nnobody,--absolutely nobody; but then also would he have been nobody\nhad all the lands of Newton belonged to him. When he had written\nthat second letter, waiving all claim to Mary's hand because of\nthe inferiority of his position, he was suffering from a morbid\nview which he had taken of his own affairs. He was telling himself\nthen,--so assuring himself, though he did not in truth believe\nthe assurance,--that he had lost not only the estate, but also\nhis father's private fortune. At that moment he had been unstrung,\ndemoralised, and unmanned,--so weak that a feather would have knocked\nhim over. The blow had been so sudden, the solitude and gloom of the\nhouse so depressing, and his sorrow so crushing, that he was ready\nto acknowledge that there could be no hope for him in any direction.\nHe had fed himself upon his own grief, till the idea of any future\nsuccess in life was almost unpalatable to him. But things had mended\nwith him now, and he would see whether there might not yet be joys\nfor him in the world. He would first see whether there might not be\nthat one great joy which he had promised to himself.\n\nAnd then there came another blow. The young Squire had resolved that\nhe would not hunt before Christmas in the Newton country. It was felt\nby him and by his brother that he should abstain from doing so out of\nrespect to the memory of his uncle, and he had declared his purpose.\nOf course there was neither hunting nor shooting in these days for\nthe other Ralph. But at the end of a month the young Squire began to\nfeel that the days went rather slowly with him, and he remembered his\nstud at the Moonbeam. He consulted Gregory; and the parson, though\nhe would fain have induced his brother to remain, could not say that\nthere was any real objection to a trip to the B. and B's. Ralph would\ngo there on the 10th of December, and be back at his own house before\nChristmas. When Christmas was over, the other Ralph was to leave\nNewton,--perhaps for ever.\n\nThe two Ralphs had become excellent friends, and when the one that\nwas to go declared his intention of going with no intention of\nreturning, the other pressed him warmly to think better of it, and\nto look upon the Priory at any rate as a second home. There were\nreasons why it could not be so, said the namesake; but in the close\nconfidence of friendship which the giving and the declining of the\noffer generated came this further blow. They were standing together\nleaning upon a gate, and looking at the exhumation of certain vast\nroots, as to which the trees once belonging to them had been made to\nfall in consequence of the improvements going on at Darvell's farm.\n\"I don't mind telling you,\" said Ralph the heir, \"that I hope soon to\nhave a mistress here.\"\n\n\"And who is she?\"\n\n\"That would be mere telling;--would it not?\"\n\n\"Clarissa Underwood?\" asked the unsuspecting Ralph.\n\nThere did come some prick of conscience, some qualm, of an injury\ndone, upon the young Squire as he made his answer. \"No; not\nClarissa;--though she is the dearest, sweetest girl that ever lived,\nand would make a better wife perhaps than the girl I think of.\"\n\n\"And who is the girl you think of?\"\n\n\"She is to be found in the same house.\"\n\n\"You do not mean the elder sister?\" said the unfortunate one. He had\nknown well that his companion had not alluded to Patience Underwood;\nbut in his agony he had suggested to himself that mode of escape.\n\n\"No; not Patience Underwood. Though, let me tell you, a man might do\nworse than marry Patience Underwood. I have always thought it a pity\nthat Patience and Gregory would not make a match of it. He, however,\nwould fall in love with Clary, and she has too much of the rake in\nher to give herself to a parson. I was thinking of Mary Bonner, who,\nto my mind, is the handsomest woman I ever saw in my life.\"\n\n\"I think she is,\" said Ralph, turning away his face.\n\n\"She hasn't a farthing, I fancy,\" continued the happy heir, \"but I\ndon't regard that now. A few months ago I had a mind to marry for\nmoney; but it isn't the sort of thing that any man should do. I have\nalmost made up my mind to ask her. Indeed, when I tell you, I suppose\nI have quite made up my mind.\"\n\n\"She'll accept you,--of course.\"\n\n\"I can say nothing about that, you know. A man must take his chance.\nI can offer her a fine position, and a girl, I think, should have\nsome regard to money when she marries, though a man should not. If\nthere's nobody before me I should have a chance, I suppose.\"\n\nHis words were not boastful, but there was a tone of triumph in his\nvoice. And why should he not triumph? thought the other Ralph. Of\ncourse he would triumph. He had everything to recommend him. And as\nfor himself,--for him, the dispossessed one,--any particle of a claim\nwhich he might have secured by means of that former correspondence\nhad been withdrawn by his own subsequent words. \"I dare say she'll\ntake you,\" he said, with his face still averted.\n\nRalph the heir did indeed think that he would be accepted, and he\nwent on to discuss the circumstances of their future home, almost\nas though Mary Bonner were already employed in getting together her\nwedding garments. His companion said nothing further, and Ralph the\nheir did not discover that anything was amiss.\n\nOn the following day Ralph the heir went across the country to the\nMoonbeam in Buckinghamshire.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\n\nNEEFIT MEANS TO STICK TO IT.\n\n\nThere was some business to be done as a matter of course before the\nyoung Squire could have all his affairs properly settled. There were\ndebts to be paid, among which Mr. Neefit's stood certainly first. It\nwas first in magnitude, and first in obligation; but it gave Ralph\nno manner of uneasiness. He had really done his best to get Polly\nto marry him, and, luckily for him,--by the direct interposition of\nsome divine Providence, as it now seemed to Ralph,--Polly had twice\nrefused him. It seemed to him, indeed, that divine Providence looked\nafter him in a special way, breaking his uncle's neck in the very\nnick of time, and filling a breeches-maker's daughter's mind with so\nsound a sense of the propriety of things, as to induce her to decline\nthe honour of being a millstone round his neck, when positively\nthe offer was pressed upon her. As things stood there could be no\ndifficulty with Mr. Neefit. The money would be paid, of course, with\nall adjuncts of accruing interest, and Mr. Neefit should go on making\nbreeches for him to the end of the chapter. And for raising this\nmoney he had still a remnant of the old property which he could sell,\nso that he need not begin by laying an ounce of encumbrance on his\npaternal estates. He was very clear in his mind at this period of\nhis life that there should never be any such encumbrance in his\ndays. That remnant of property should be sold, and Neefit, Horsball,\nand others, should be paid. But it certainly did occur to him in\nregard to Neefit, that there had been that between them which made\nit expedient that the matter should be settled with some greater\ncourtesy than would be shown by a simple transaction through his man\nof business. Therefore he wrote a few lines to Mr. Neefit on the day\nbefore he left the Priory,--a few lines which he thought to be very\ncivil.\n\n\n   Newton, 9th December, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR MR. NEEFIT,--\n\n   You have probably heard before this of the accident which\n   has happened in my family. My uncle has been killed by\n   a fall from his horse, and I have come into my property\n   earlier than I expected. As soon as I could begin to\n   attend to matters of business, I thought of my debt to\n   you, and of all the obligation I owe you. I think the debt\n   is \u00c2\u00a31,000; but whatever it is it can be paid now. The\n   money will be ready early in the year, if that will do for\n   you,--and I am very much obliged to you. Would you mind\n   letting Mr. Carey know how much it is, interest and all.\n   He is our family lawyer.\n\n   Remember me very kindly to Miss Polly. I hope she will\n   always think of me as a friend. Would you tell Bawwah to\n   put three pairs of breeches in hand for me,--leather.\n\n   Yours very truly,\n\n   RALPH NEWTON.\n\n\nThe wrath of Mr. Neefit on receiving this letter at his shop in\nConduit Street was almost divine. He had heard from Polly an account\nof that last interview at Ramsgate, and Polly had told her story as\ntruly as she knew how to tell it. But the father had never for a\nmoment allowed himself to conceive that therefore the thing was at\nan end, and had instructed Polly that she was not to look upon it\nin that light. He regarded his young customer as absolutely bound\nto him, and would not acknowledge to himself that such obligation\ncould be annulled by Polly's girlish folly. And he did believe that\nyoung Newton intended to act, as he called it, \"on the square.\" So\nbelieving, he was ready to make almost any sacrifice of himself; but\nthat Newton should now go back, after having received his hard money,\nwas to him a thing quite out of the question. He scolded Polly with\nsome violence, and asked whether she wanted to marry such a lout as\nMoggs. Polly replied with spirit that she wouldn't marry any man till\nshe found that she could love him, and that the man loved her. \"Ain't\nhe told you as he loves you ever so often?\" said Neefit. \"I know what\nI'm doing of, father,\" said Polly, \"and I'm not going to be drove.\"\nNevertheless Mr. Neefit had felt certain that if young Newton would\nstill act upon the square, things would settle themselves rightly.\nThere was the money due, and, as Neefit constantly said to himself,\n\"money was a thing as was not to be got over.\"\n\nThen had come upon the tradesman the tidings of the old Squire's\ndeath. They were read to him out of a newspaper by his shopman,\nWaddle. \"I'm blessed if he ain't been and tumbled all at once into\nhis uncle's shoes,\" said Waddle. The paragraph in question was one\nwhich appeared in a weekly newspaper some two days after the Squire's\ndeath. Neefit, who at the moment was turning over the pages of his\nledger, came down from his desk and stood for about ten minutes in\nthe middle of his shop, while the Herr ceased from his cutting, and\nWaddle read the paragraph over and over again. Neefit stood stock\nstill, with his hands in his breeches pockets, and his great staring\neyes fixed upon vacancy. \"I'm blessed if it ain't true,\" said Waddle,\nconvinced by the repetition of his own reading. News had previously\nreached the shop that the Squire had had a fall. Tidings as to\ntroubles in the hunting-field were quick in reaching Mr. Neefit's\nshop;--but there had been no idea that the accident would prove to\nbe fatal. Neefit, when he went home that night, told his wife and\ndaughter. \"That will be the last of young Newton,\" said Mrs. Neefit.\n\"I'm d---- if it will!\" said the breeches-maker. Polly maintained a\ndiscreet silence as to the heir, merely remarking that it was very\nsad for the old gentleman. Polly at that time was very full of\nadmiration for Moggs,--in regard, that is, to the political character\nof her lover. Moggs had lost his election, but was about to petition.\n\nNeefit was never called upon, in the way of his own trade, to make\nfunereal garments. Men, when they are bereaved of their friends, do\nnot ride in black breeches. But he had all a tailor's respect for a\ncustomer with a dead relation. He felt that it would not become him\nto make an application to the young Squire on a subject connected\nwith marriage, till the tombstone over the old Squire should have\nbeen properly adjusted. He was a patient man, and could wait. And\nhe was a man not good at writing letters. His customer and future\nson-in-law would turn up soon; or else, the expectant father-in-law\nmight drop down upon him at the Moonbeam or elsewhere. As for a final\nescape, Polly Neefit's father hardly feared that any such attempt\nwould be made. The young man had acted on the square, and had made\nhis offer in good faith.\n\nSuch was Mr. Neefit's state of mind when he received the young\nSquire's letter. The letter almost knocked him down. There was a\ndecision about it, a confidence that all was over between them except\nthe necessary payment of the money, an absence of all doubt as to\n\"Miss Polly,\" which he could not endure. And then that order for\nmore breeches, included in the very same paragraph with Polly,\nwas most injurious. It must be owned that the letter was a cruel,\nheart-rending, bad letter. For an hour or so it nearly broke Mr.\nNeefit's heart. But he resolved that he was not going to be done.\nThe young Squire should marry his daughter, or the whole transaction\nshould be published to the world. He would do such things and say\nsuch things that the young Squire should certainly not have a good\ntime of it. He said not a word to Polly of the letter that night, but\nhe did speak of the young Squire. \"When that young man comes again,\nMiss Polly,\" he said, \"I shall expect you to take him.\"\n\n\"I don't know anything about that, father,\" said Polly. \"He's had his\nanswer, and I'm thinking he won't ask for another.\" Upon this the\nbreeches-maker looked at his daughter, but made no other reply.\n\nDuring the two or three following days Neefit made some inquiries,\nand found that his customer was at the Moonbeam. It was now necessary\nthat he should go to work at once, and, therefore, with many\nmisgivings, he took Waddle into his confidence. He could not himself\nwrite such a letter as then must be written;--but Waddle was perfect\nat the writing of letters. Waddle shrugged his shoulders, and clearly\ndid not believe that Polly would ever get the young Squire. Waddle\nindeed went so far as to hint that his master would be lucky in\nobtaining payment of his money,--but, nevertheless, he gave his mind\nto the writing of the letter. The letter was written as follows:--\n\n\n   Conduit Street, 14th December, 186--.\n\n   DEAR SIR,--\n\n   Yours of the 9th instant has come to hand, and I beg to\n   say with compliments how shocked we were to hear of the\n   Squire's accident. It was terribly sudden, and we all felt\n   it very much; as in the way of our business we very often\n   have to.\n\n   As to the money that can stand. Between friends such\n   things needn't be mentioned. Any accommodation of that\n   kind was and always will be ready when required. As to\n   that other matter, a young gentleman like you won't think\n   that a young lady is to be taken at her first word. A\n   bargain is a bargain, and honourable is honourable, which\n   nobody knows as well as you who was always disposed to\n   be upon the square. Our Polly hasn't forgotten you,--and\n   isn't going.\n\n\nIt should be acknowledged on Mr. Waddle's behalf, that that last\nassurance was inserted by the unassisted energy of Mr. Neefit\nhimself.\n\n\n   We shall expect to see you without delay, here or at\n   Hendon, as may best suit; but pray remember that things\n   stand just as they was. Touching other matters, as needn't\n   be named here, orders will be attended to as usual if\n   given separate.\n\n   Yours very truly and obedient,\n\n   THOMAS NEEFIT.\n\n\nThis letter duly reached the young Squire, and did not add to his\nhappiness at the Moonbeam. That he should ever renew his offer to\nPolly Neefit was, he well knew, out of the question; but he could\nsee before him an infinity of trouble should the breeches-maker be\nfoolish enough to press him to do so. He had acted \"on the square.\"\nIn compliance with the bargain undoubtedly made by him, he had twice\nproposed to Polly, and had Polly accepted his offer on either of\nthese occasions, there would,--he now acknowledged to himself,--have\nbeen very great difficulty in escaping from the difficulty. Polly\nhad thought fit to refuse him, and of course he was free. But,\nnevertheless, there might be trouble in store for him. He had hardly\nbegun to ask himself in what way this trouble might next show itself,\nwhen Neefit was at the Moonbeam. Three days after the receipt of\nhis letter, when he rode into the Moonbeam yard on his return from\nhunting, there was Mr. Neefit waiting to receive him.\n\nHe certainly had not answered Mr. Neefit's letter, having told\nhimself that he might best do so by a personal visit in Conduit\nStreet; but now that Neefit was there, the personal intercourse did\nnot seem to him to be so easy. He greeted the breeches-maker very\nwarmly, while Pepper, Cox, and Mr. Horsball, with sundry grooms and\nhelpers, stood by and admired. Something of Mr. Neefit's money, and\nof Polly's charms as connected with the young Squire, had already\nreached the Moonbeam by the tongue of Rumour; and now Mr. Neefit had\nbeen waiting for the last four hours in the little parlour within\nthe Moonbeam bar. He had eaten his mutton chop, and drunk three or\nfour glasses of gin and water, but had said nothing of his mission.\nMrs. Horsball, however, had already whispered her suspicions to her\nhusband's sister, a young lady of forty, who dispensed rum, gin, and\nbrandy, with very long ringlets and very small glasses.\n\n\"You want to have a few words with me, old fellow,\" said Ralph to\nthe breeches-maker, with a cheery laugh. It was a happy idea that of\nmaking them all around conceive that Neefit had come after his money.\nOnly it was not successful. Men are not dunned so rigorously when\nthey have just fallen into their fortunes. Neefit, hardly speaking\nabove his breath, with that owlish, stolid look, which was always\ncommon to him except when he was measuring a man for a pair of\nbreeches, acknowledged that he did. \"Come along, old fellow,\"\nsaid Ralph, taking him by the arm. \"But what'll you take to drink\nfirst?\" Neefit shook his head, and accompanied Ralph into the house.\nRalph had a private sitting-room of his own, so that there was no\ndifficulty on that score. \"What's all this about?\" he said, standing\nwith his back to the fire, and still holding Neefit by the arm. He\ndid it very well, but he did not as yet know the depth of Neefit's\nobstinacy.\n\n\"What's it all about?\" asked Neefit in disgust.\n\n\"Well; yes. Have you talked to Polly herself about this, old fellow?\"\n\n\"No, I ain't; and I don't mean.\"\n\n\"Twice I went to her, and twice she refused me. Come, Neefit, be\nreasonable. A man can't be running after a girl all his life, when\nshe won't have anything to say to him. I did all that a man could\ndo; and upon my honour I was very fond of her. But, God bless my\nsoul,--there must be an end to everything.\"\n\n\"There ain't to be no end to this, Mr. Newton.\"\n\n\"I'm to marry the girl whether she will or not?\"\n\n\"Nohow,\" said Mr. Neefit, oracularly. \"But when a young gentleman\nasks a young lady as whether she'll have him, she's not a-going to\njump down his throat. You knows that, Mr. Newton. And as for money,\ndid I ask for any settlement? I'd a' been ashamed to mention money.\nWhen are you a-coming to see our Polly, that's the question?\"\n\n\"I shall come no more, Mr. Neefit.\"\n\n\"You won't?\"\n\n\"Certainly not, Mr. Neefit. I've been twice rejected.\"\n\n\"And that's the kind of man you are; is it? You're one of them sort,\nare you?\" Then he looked out of his saucer eyes upon the young Squire\nwith a fishy ferocity, which was very unpleasant. It was quite\nevident that he meant war. \"If that's your game, Mr. Newton, I'll be\neven with you.\"\n\n\"Mr. Neefit, I'll pay you anything that you say I owe you.\"\n\n\"Damn your money!\" said the breeches-maker, walking out of the room.\nWhen he got down into the bar he told them all there that young\nNewton was engaged to his daughter, and that, by G----, he should\nmarry her.\n\n\"Stick to that, Neefit,\" said Lieutenant Cox.\n\n\"I mean to stick to it,\" said Mr. Neefit. He then ordered another\nglass of gin and water, and was driven back to the station.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\n\"HE MUST MARRY HER.\"\n\n\nOn the day following that on which Mr. Neefit made his journey to the\nMoonbeam, Sir Thomas Underwood was at his chambers in London. It was\nnow eight weeks since his bone had been broken, and though he still\ncarried his arm in a sling, he declared of himself that he was able\nto go about as usual;--which assertion was taken at the villa as\nmeaning that he was now able to live in Southampton Buildings without\nfurther assistance from women. When Patience reminded him, with\ntears in her eyes, that he could not as yet put on his own coat,\nhe reminded her that Stemm was the most careful of men. Up to\nLondon he went with a full understanding that he was not at any\nrate to be expected home on that night. He had business on hand of\ngreat importance, which, as he declared, made his presence in town\nimperative. Mr. Trigger, from Percycross, was to be up with reference\nto the pestilent petition which had been presented against the\nreturn of Griffenbottom and himself. Moggs had petitioned on his own\nbehalf, and two of the Liberals of the borough had also petitioned\nin the interest of Mr. Westmacott. The two Liberal parties who\nhad quarrelled during the contest had now again joined forces in\nreference to the petition, and there was no doubt that the matter\nwould go on before the judge. Mr. Trigger was coming up to London\nwith reference to the defence. Sir Thomas gave Stemm to understand\nthat Mr. Trigger would call at one o'clock.\n\nExactly at one o'clock the bell was rung at Sir Thomas's outside\ndoor, and Stemm was on the alert to give entrance to Mr. Trigger.\nWhen the door was opened who should present himself but our\nunfortunate friend Neefit. He humbly asked whether Sir Thomas was\nwithin, and received a reply which, as coming from Stemm, was\ncourteous in the extreme. \"Mr. Trigger, I suppose;--walk in, Mr.\nTrigger.\" Neefit, not at all understanding why he was called Trigger,\ndid walk in. Stemm, opening the door of his master's sanctum,\nannounced Mr. Trigger. Neefit advanced into the middle of the room.\nSir Thomas, with some solicitude as to the adjustment of his arm,\nrose to greet his agent from Percy cross. \"This isn't Mr. Trigger,\"\nsaid Sir Thomas. \"He told me he was, anyhow,\" said Stemm, \"I didn't\ntell you nothing of the kind,\" said Neefit. \"But you come from\nPercycross?\" said Sir Thomas. \"No I don't; I comes from Conduit\nStreet,\" said Neefit. \"You must go away,\" said Stemm, leaving the\ndoor open, and advancing into the room as though to turn the enemy's\nflank.\n\nBut Neefit, having made good his point so far, did not intend to be\ndislodged without a struggle on his own part. \"I've something to say\nto Sir Thomas about Mr. Newton, as I wants to say very particular.\"\n\"You can't say it now,\" said Stemm. \"Oh, but I can,\" said Neefit,\n\"and it won't take three minutes.\" \"Wouldn't another day do for\nit, as I am particularly busy now?\" pleaded Sir Thomas. \"Well, Sir\nThomas;--to tell the truth, it wouldn't,\" said Mr. Neefit, standing\nhis ground. Then there came another ring at the bell. \"Ask Mr.\nTrigger to sit down in the other room for two minutes, Stemm,\" said\nSir Thomas. And so Mr. Neefit had carried his point. \"And now, sir,\"\nsaid Sir Thomas, \"as I am particularly engaged, I will ask you to be\nas quick as possible.\"\n\n\"My name is Neefit,\" began the breeches-maker,--and then paused.\nSir Thomas, who had heard the name from Ralph, but had forgotten\nit altogether, merely bowed his head. \"I am the breeches-maker of\nConduit Street,\" continued Mr. Neefit, with a proud conviction that\nhe too had ascended so high in his calling as to be justified in\npresuming that he was known to mankind. Sir Thomas again bowed.\nNeefit went on with his story. \"Mr. Newton is a-going to behave to me\nvery bad.\"\n\n\"If he owes you money, he can pay you now,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"He do owe me money;--a thousand pound he owe me.\"\n\n\"A thousand pounds for breeches!\"\n\n\"No, Sir Thomas. It's most for money lent; but it's not along of that\nas I'd trouble you. I know how to get my money, or to put up with the\nloss if I don't. A thousand pound ain't here nor there,--not in what\nI've got to say. I wouldn't demean myself to ring at your bell, Sir\nThomas;--not in the way of looking for a thousand pounds.\"\n\n\"In God's name, then, what is it? Pray be quick.\"\n\n\"He's going back from his word as he's promised to my daughter.\nThat's what it is.\" As Neefit paused again, Sir Thomas remembered\nRalph's proposition, made in his difficulties, as to marrying a\ntradesman's daughter for money, and at once fell to the conclusion\nthat Mr. and Miss Neefit had been ill-used. \"Sir Thomas,\" continued\nthe breeches-maker, \"I've been as good as a father to him. I gave him\nmoney when nobody else wouldn't.\"\n\n\"Do you mean that he has had money from you?\"\n\n\"Yes; in course he has; ever so much. I paid for him a lot of money\nto 'Orsball, where he 'unts. Money! I should think so. Didn't I pay\nMoggs for him, the bootmaker? The very money as is rattling in his\npocket now is my money.\"\n\n\"And he engaged himself to your daughter?\"\n\n\"He engaged hisself to me to marry her. He won't say no otherwise\nhimself. And he asked her twice. Why, Sir Thomas, he was all on the\nsquare about it till the old gentleman broke his neck. He hadn't\nnowhere else to go to for a shilling. But now the estate's come in\nlike, he's for behaving dishonourable. He don't know me yet; that's\nwhat he don't. But I'll make him know me, Sir Thomas.\"\n\nThen the door was opened, and Stemm's head appeared. \"Mr. Trigger\nsays as he's in the greatest possible haste, Sir Thomas.\" The reader,\nhowever, may as well be informed that this was pure invention on the\npart of Mr. Stemm.\n\nSir Thomas tore his hair and rubbed his face. He couldn't bid Neefit\nto call again, as he certainly did not desire to have a second visit.\n\"What can I do for you, Mr. Neefit? I have no doubt the money will be\npaid, if owing. I will guarantee that for you.\"\n\n\"It ain't the money. I knows how to get my money.\"\n\n\"Then what can I do for you?\"\n\n\"Make him go upon the square, Sir Thomas.\"\n\n\"How can I make him? He's twenty-six years old, and he's nothing to\nme. I don't think he should marry the young lady. He's not in her\nrank of life. If he has done her an injury, he must pay for it.\"\n\n\"Injury!\" shouted Neefit, upon whose mind the word produced an\nunintended idea. \"No, no! Our Polly ain't like that. By G----, I'd\neat him, if it was that way! There ain't a duchess in the land as 'd\n've guv' him his answer more ready than Polly had he ever spoke to\nher that way.\"\n\n\"If he has given rise to hopes which through him will be\ndisappointed,\" said Sir Thomas, gravely, \"he is bound to make what\ncompensation may be in his power.\"\n\n\"Compensation be d----!\" said Neefit. \"He must marry her.\"\n\n\"I don't think he will do that.\"\n\n\"You didn't think he would take my money, I suppose; but he did.\nYou didn't think he'd come and spend his Sundays out at my cottage,\nbut he did. You didn't think as he'd come after our Polly down to\nRamsgate, but he did. You didn't think as he'd give me his word to\nmake her his wife, but he did.\" At every assertion that he made, the\nbreeches-maker bobbed forward his bullet head, stretched open his\neyes, and stuck out his under lip. During all this excited energy,\nhe was not a man pleasant to the eye. \"And now how is it to be, Sir\nThomas? That's what I want to know.\"\n\n\"Mr. Newton is nothing to me, Mr. Neefit.\"\n\n\"Oh;--that's all. Nothing to you, ain't he? Wasn't he brought up by\nyou just as a son like? And now he ain't nothing to you! Do you mean\nto say as he didn't ought to marry my girl?\"\n\n\"I think he ought not to marry her.\"\n\n\"Not arter his promise?\"\n\nSir Thomas was driven very hard, whereas had the sly old\nbreeches-maker told all his story, there would have been no\ndifficulty at all. \"I think such a marriage would lead to the\nhappiness of neither party. If an injury has been done,--as I fear\nmay be too probable,--I will advise my young friend to make any\nreparation in his power--short of marriage. I can say nothing\nfurther, Mr. Neefit.\"\n\n\"And that's your idea of being on the square, Sir Thomas?\"\n\n\"I can say nothing further, Mr. Neefit. As I have an appointment\nmade, I must ask you to leave me.\" As Sir Thomas said this, his hand\nwas upon the bell.\n\n\"Very well;--very well. As sure as my name's Neefit, he shall hear of\nme. And so shall you, Sir Thomas. Don't you be poking at me in that\nway, old fellow. I don't choose to be poked at.\" These last words\nwere addressed to Stemm, who had entered the room, and was holding\nthe door open for Mr. Neefit's exit with something more than the\nenergy customary in speeding a parting guest. Mr. Neefit, however,\ndid take his departure, and Sir Thomas joined Mr. Trigger in the\nother room.\n\nWe will not be present at that interview. Sir Thomas had been in a\ngreat hurry to get rid of Mr. Neefit, but it may be doubted whether\nhe found Mr. Trigger much better company. Mr. Trigger's business\nchiefly consisted in asking Sir Thomas for a considerable sum of\nmoney, and in explaining to him that the petition would certainly\ncost a large sum beyond this,--unless the expenses could be saddled\non Westmacott and Moggs, as to which result Mr. Trigger seemed\nto have considerable doubt. But perhaps the bitterest part of Mr.\nTrigger's communication consisted in the expression of his opinion\nthat Mr. Griffenbottom should be held by Sir Thomas free from any\nexpense as to the petition, on the ground that Griffenbottom, had he\nstood alone, would certainly have carried one of the seats without\nany fear of a petition. \"I don't think I can undertake that, Mr.\nTrigger,\" said Sir Thomas. Mr. Trigger simply shrugged his shoulders.\n\nSir Thomas, when he was alone, was very uncomfortable. While at\nPercycross he had extracted from Patience an idea that Ralph the heir\nand Clarissa were attached to each other, and he had very strongly\ndeclared that he would not admit an engagement between them. At that\ntime Ralph was supposed to have sold his inheritance, and did not\nstand well in Sir Thomas's eyes. Then had come the Squire's death and\nthe altered position of his late ward. Sir Thomas would be injured,\nwould be made subject to unjust reproach if it were thought of him\nthat he would be willing to give his daughter to a young man simply\nbecause that young man owned an estate. He had no such sordid feeling\nin regard to his girls. But he did feel that all that had occurred\nat Newton had made a great difference. Ralph would now live at the\nPriory, and there would be enough even for his extravagance. Should\nthe Squire of Newton ask him for his girl's hand with that girl's\nconsent, he thought that he could hardly refuse it. How could he ask\nClarissa to abandon so much seeming happiness because the man had\nfailed to keep out of debt upon a small income? He could not do so.\nAnd then it came to pass that he was prepared to admit Ralph as a\nsuitor to his child should Ralph renew his request to that effect.\nThey had all loved the lad as a boy, and the property was wholly\nunencumbered. Of course he said nothing to Clarissa; but should Ralph\ncome to him there could be but one answer. Such had been the state of\nhis mind before Mr. Neefit's visit.\n\nBut the breeches-maker's tale had altered the aspect of things very\ngreatly. Under no circumstances could Sir Thomas recommend the young\nSquire to marry the daughter of the man who had been with him; but if\nRalph Newton had really engaged himself to this girl, and had done\nso with the purport of borrowing money from the father, that might\nbe a reason why, notwithstanding the splendour of his prospects, he\nshould not be admitted to further intimacy at the villa. To borrow\nmoney from one's tradesman was, in the eyes of Sir Thomas, about\nas inexcusable an offence as a young man could commit. He was too\nmuch disturbed in mind to go home on the following day, but on the\nThursday he returned to the villa. The following Sunday would be\nChristmas Day.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\n\nFOR TWO REASONS.\n\n\nThe young Squire, as soon as Neefit had left him in his own\nsitting-room at the Moonbeam, sat himself down and began to think\nover his affairs seriously. One thing was certain to him;--nothing on\nearth should induce him to offer his hand again to Polly Neefit. He\nhad had a most miraculous escape, and assuredly would run no further\nrisk in that direction. But though he had escaped, he could perceive\nthat there was considerable trouble before him,--considerable trouble\nand perhaps some disgrace. It certainly could not be proved against\nhim that he had broken any promise, as there had been no engagement;\nbut it could be made public that he had twice offered himself to\nPolly, and could also be made public that he had borrowed the\nbreeches-maker's money. He kept himself alone on that evening; and\nthough he hunted on the following day, he was not found to be a\nlively companion either by Cox or Pepper. The lieutenant was talking\nabout Neefit and Neefit's daughter all day: but Mr. Pepper, who was\nmore discreet, declined to canvass the subject. \"It's nothing to me\nwho a man marries and who he don't,\" said Mr. Pepper. \"What sort of\nhorses he rides;--that's what I look at.\" During this day and the\nnext Ralph did consider the state of his affairs very closely, and\nthe conclusion he came to was this, that the sooner he could engage\nhimself to marry Mary Bonner the better. If he were once engaged, the\nengagement would not then be broken off because of any previous folly\nwith Miss Neefit; and, again, if he were once engaged to Mary Bonner,\nNeefit would see the absurdity of torturing him further in regard\nto Polly. On the Wednesday evening he went up to town, and on the\nThursday morning he put himself into a cab and ordered the man to\ndrive him to Popham Villa.\n\nIt was about noon when he started from town; and though he never\nhesitated,--did not pause for a moment after he had made up his mind\nas to the thing that he would do, still he felt many misgivings as\nhe was driven down to Fulham. How should he begin his story to Mary\nBonner, and how should he look Clary Underwood in the face? And yet\nhe had not an idea that he was in truth going to behave badly to\nClarissa. There had no doubt been a sort of tenderness in the feeling\nthat had existed between them,--a something just a little warmer than\nbrotherly regard. They had been thrown together and had liked each\nother. And as he was driven nearer to the villa, he remembered\ndistinctly that he had kissed her on the lawn. But did any one\nsuppose that a man was bound to marry the first girl he kissed,--or\nif not the first, then why the second, or the third? Clarissa could\nhave no fair ground of complaint against him; and yet he was uneasy\nas he reflected that she too must know the purport of his present\nvisit to the villa.\n\nAnd he was not quite easy about Mary. The good things which he\ncarried in his hand were so many that he did not conceive that Mary\nwould refuse him; but yet he wished that the offer had been made, and\nhad been accepted. Hitherto he had taken pleasure in his intercourse\nwith young ladies, and had rather enjoyed the excitement of those\nmoments which to some men are troublesome and even painful. When\nhe had told Clarissa that she was dearer than any one else, he had\nbeen very happy while he was telling her. There had been nothing of\nembarrassment to him in the work of proposing to Polly Neefit. There\nmay perhaps have been other passages in his life of the same nature,\nand he certainly had not feared them beforehand or been ashamed of\nthem afterwards. But now he found himself endeavouring to think what\nwords he would use to Mary Bonner, and in what attitude he would\nstand or sit as he used them. \"The truth is,\" he said to himself, \"a\nman should do these kind of things without premeditation.\" But not\nthe less was he resolved, and at the gate he jumped out of his cab\nwith a determination to have it over as soon as possible. He desired\nthe cabman to wait for him at the nearest stables, remarking that\nhe might be there for a few minutes, or for a few hours, and then\nturned to the gate. As he did so, he saw Sir Thomas walking from the\ndirection of Fulham Bridge. Sir Thomas had come down by the railway\non the other side of the river, and was now walking home. A sudden\nthought struck the young Squire. He would begin his work by telling\nhis tale to Sir Thomas. There could be nothing so fitting as that he\nshould obtain the uncle's leave to address the niece.\n\nThe two men greeted each other, and there were many things to be\nsaid. Sir Thomas had not seen his ward since the old Squire's death,\nand Ralph had not seen Sir Thomas since the election at Percycross\nand the accident of the broken arm. Sir Thomas was by far too\nreticent, too timid, and too reflective a man to begin at once\nwhatever observations he might have to make ultimately in regard to\nMiss Polly Neefit. He was somewhat slow of speech, unless specially\naroused, and had hardly received the congratulations of his young\nfriend respecting the election, and expressed with some difficult\ndecency his sorrow for the old Squire's death as combined with his\nsatisfaction that the estate had not been sacrificed, when Ralph\nstopped him just as they had reached the front door, and, with much\nsolemnity of manner, declared his wish to make a very particular\nprivate communication to Sir Thomas. \"Certainly,\" said Sir Thomas,\n\"certainly. Come into my room.\" But there was some delay before this\nprivacy could be achieved, for in the hall they were met by the\nthree girls, and of course there were many things to be said by them.\nClarissa could hardly repress the flutter of her heart. When the\nreader last saw her flutter, and last heard her words as she spoke of\nher love to her cousin, she was taking an opportunity of declaring\nto Mary Bonner that she did not begrudge the brilliance of Mary's\npresent prospects,--though the grand estate which made them brilliant\nwas in a measure taken from her own hopes. And she had owned at the\nsame time that she did not dare to feel confidence in her own love,\nbecause her lover would now be too poor in his own esteem to indulge\nhimself with the luxury of a wife. All this Mary had accepted from\nher, certainly with no expression of triumph, but certainly with some\ntriumph in her heart. Now this was entirely changed,--and here was\nher lover, with his fortune restored to him, once more beneath her\nfather's roof! She gave him her hand the first of the three. She\ncould not repress herself. He took it with a smile, and pressed it\nwarmly. But he turned to Patience and took hers as rapidly as he was\nable. Then came Mary's turn. \"I hope you also are glad to see me once\nagain?\" he said. Clarissa's heart sank within her as she heard the\nwords. The appreciation of a woman in such matters is as fine as the\nnose of a hound, and is all but unintelligible to a man. \"Oh, yes,\nMr. Newton,\" said Mary smiling. \"But if he asks her, she'll take\nhim.\" No such words as these were formed even in Clarissa's mind; but\nafter some fashion such was the ejaculation of her heart. Mary's \"Oh,\nyes,\" had meant little enough, but could Mary withstand such chances\nif they were offered to her?\n\nSir Thomas led the way into his private room, and Ralph followed him.\n\"You won't be long, papa,\" said Patience.\n\n\"I hope not,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"Remember, Ralph, you will be keeping lunch waiting,\" said Patience.\n\nThen the two men were alone. Sir Thomas's mind had recurred to Neefit\nat the first moment of Ralph's request. The young man was going to\nconsult him as to the best mode of getting rid of that embarrassment.\nBut in the hall another idea had come upon him. He was to be asked\nfor his consent regarding Clarissa. As he seated himself in one chair\nand asked Ralph to take another, he had not quite made up his mind\nas to the answer he would give. There must at any rate be some delay.\nThe reader will of course remember that Sir Thomas was persuaded that\nRalph had engaged himself to marry Polly Neefit.\n\nRalph rushed boldly at his subject at once. \"Sir Thomas,\" he said,\n\"I am going to make a proposition, and I wish to ask you for your\nconsent. I have made up my mind that the sooner I marry in my present\ncondition the better.\" Sir Thomas smiled and assented. \"And I want to\nknow whether you will object to my asking Miss Bonner to be my wife.\"\n\n\"Miss Bonner!\" said Sir Thomas, throwing up both his hands.\n\n\"Yes, sir;--is there any objection on your part?\"\n\nSir Thomas hardly knew how to say whether there was or was not an\nobjection on his part. In the first place he had made up his mind\nthat the other Ralph was to marry Mary,--that he would do so in spite\nof that disclaimer which had been made in the first moment of the\nyoung man's disinheritance. He, Sir Thomas, however, could have no\nright to object on that score. Nor could he raise any objection on\nthe score of Clarissa. It did seem to him that all the young people\nwere at cross purposes, that Patience must have been very stupid and\nClarissa most addlepated, or else that this Ralph was abominably\nfalse; but still, he could say nothing respecting that. No tale had\nreached his ears which made it even possible for him to refer to\nClarissa. But yet he was dissatisfied with the man, and was disposed\nto show it. \"Perhaps I ought to tell you,\" said Sir Thomas, \"that a\nman calling himself Neefit was with me yesterday.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes; the breeches-maker.\"\n\n\"I believe he said that such was his trade. He assured me that you\nhad borrowed large sums of money from him.\"\n\n\"I do owe him some money.\"\n\n\"A thousand pounds, I think he said.\"\n\n\"Certainly as much as that.\"\n\n\"Not for breeches,--which I suppose would be impossible, but for\nmoney advanced.\"\n\n\"Part one and part the other,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"And he went on to tell me that you were engaged,--to marry his\ndaughter.\"\n\n\"That is untrue.\"\n\n\"Were you never engaged to her?\"\n\n\"I was never engaged to her, Sir Thomas.\"\n\n\"And it was all a lie on the part of Mr. Neefit? Was there no\nfoundation for it? You had told me yourself that you thought of such\na marriage.\"\n\n\"There is nothing to justify him in saying that I was ever engaged\nto the young lady. The truth is that I did ask her and she,--refused\nme.\"\n\n\"You did ask her?\"\n\n\"I did ask her,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"In earnest?\"\n\n\"Well; yes;--certainly in earnest. At that time I thought it the only\nway to save the property. I need not tell you how wretched I was at\nthe time. You will remember what you yourself had said to me. It\nis true that I asked her, and that I did so by agreement with her\nfather. She refused me,--twice. She was so good, so sensible, and so\ntrue, that she knew she had better not make herself a party to such\na bargain. Whatever you may think of my own conduct I shall not have\nbehaved badly to Miss Neefit.\"\n\nSir Thomas did think very ill of Ralph's conduct, but he believed\nhim. After a while the whole truth came out, as to the money lent and\nas to Neefit's schemes. It was of course understood by both of them\nthat Ralph was required neither by honesty nor by honour to renew\nhis offer. And then under such circumstances was he or was he not to\nbe allowed to propose to Mary Bonner? At first Ralph had been much\ndismayed at having the Neefit mine sprung on him at such a moment;\nbut he collected himself very quickly, and renewed his demand as\nto Mary. Sir Thomas could not mean to say that because he had been\nfoolish in regard to Polly Neefit, that therefore he was to be\ndebarred from marrying! Sir Thomas did not exactly say that; but,\nnevertheless, Sir Thomas showed his displeasure. \"It seems,\" said he,\n\"particularly easy to you to transfer your affections.\"\n\n\"My affection for Miss Neefit was not strong,\" said Ralph. \"I did,\nand always shall, regard her as a most excellent young woman.\"\n\n\"She showed her sense in refusing you,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"I think she did,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"And I doubt much whether my niece will not be equally--sensible.\"\n\n\"Ah,--I can say nothing as to that.\"\n\n\"Were she to hear this story of Miss Neefit I am sure she would\nrefuse you.\"\n\n\"But you would not tell it to her,--as yet! If all goes well with me\nI will tell it to her some day. Come, Sir Thomas, you don't mean to\nbe hard upon me at last. It cannot be that you should really regret\nthat I have got out of that trouble.\"\n\n\"But I regret much that you should have borrowed a tradesman's money,\nand more that you should have offered to pay the debt by marrying his\ndaughter.\" Through it all, however, there was a feeling present to\nSir Thomas that he was, in truth, angry with the Squire of Newton,\nnot so much for his misconduct in coming to propose to Mary so soon\nafter the affair with Polly Neefit, but because he had not come to\npropose to Clarissa. And Sir Thomas knew that such a feeling, if it\ndid really exist, must be overcome. Mary was entitled to her chance,\nand must make the best of it. He would not refuse his sanction to a\nmarriage with his niece on account of Ralph's misconduct, when he\nwould have sanctioned a marriage with his own daughter in spite of\nthat misconduct. The conversation was ended by Sir Thomas leaving\nthe room with a promise that Miss Bonner should be sent to fill his\nplace. In five minutes Miss Bonner was there. She entered the room\nvery slowly, with a countenance that was almost savage, and during\nthe few minutes that she remained there she did not sit down.\n\n\"Sir Thomas has told you why I am here?\" he said, advancing towards\nher, and taking her hand.\n\n\"No; that is;--no. He has not told me.\"\n\n\"Mary--\"\n\n\"Mr. Newton, my name is Miss Bonner.\"\n\n\"And must it between us be so cold as that?\" He still had her by the\nhand, which she did not at the moment attempt to withdraw. \"I have\ncome to tell you, at the first moment that was possible to me after\nmy uncle's death, that of all women in the world I love you the\nbest.\"\n\nThen she withdrew her hand. \"Mr. Newton, I am sorry to hear you say\nso;--very sorry.\"\n\n\"Why should you be sorry? If you are unkind to me like this, there\nmay be reason why I should be sorry. I shall, indeed, be very sorry.\nSince I first saw you, I have hoped that you would be my wife.\"\n\n\"I never can be your wife, Mr. Newton.\"\n\n\"Why not? Have I done anything to offend you? Being here as one of\nthe family you must know enough of my affairs to feel sure,--that I\nhave come to you the first moment that was possible. I did not dare\nto come when I thought that my position was one that was not worthy\nof you.\"\n\n\"It would have been the same at any time,\" said Mary.\n\n\"And why should you reject me,--like this; without a moment's\nthought?\"\n\n\"For two reasons,\" said Mary, slowly, and then she paused, as though\ndoubting whether she would continue her speech, or give the two\nreasons which now guided her. But he stood, looking into her face,\nwaiting for them. \"In the first place,\" she said, \"I think you are\nuntrue to another person.\" Then she paused again, as though asking\nherself whether that reason would not suffice. But she resolved that\nshe would be bold, and give the other. \"In the next place, my heart\nis not my own to give.\"\n\n\"Is it so?\" asked Ralph.\n\n\"I have said as much as can be necessary,--perhaps more, and I would\nrather go now.\" Then she left the room with the same slow, stately\nstep, and he saw her no more on that day.\n\nThen in those short five minutes Sir Thomas had absolutely told\nher the whole story about Polly Neefit, and she had come to the\nconclusion that because in his trouble he had offered to marry a\ntradesman's daughter, therefore he was to be debarred from ever\nreceiving the hand of a lady! That was the light in which he looked\nupon Mary's first announcement. As to the second announcement he was\nabsolutely at a loss. There must probably, he thought, have been some\nengagement before she left Jamaica. Not the less on that account was\nit an act of unpardonable ill-nature on the part of Sir Thomas,--that\ntelling of Polly Neefit's story to Mary Bonner at such a moment.\n\nHe was left alone for a few minutes after Mary's departure, and then\nPatience came to him. Would he stay for dinner? Even Patience was\nvery cold to him. Sir Thomas was fatigued and was lying down, but\nwould see him, of course, if he wished it. \"And where is Clarissa?\"\nasked Ralph. Patience said that Clarissa was not very well. She also\nwas lying down. \"I see what it is,\" said Ralph, turning upon her\nangrily. \"You are, all of you, determined to quarrel with me because\nof my uncle's death.\"\n\n\"I do not see why that should make us quarrel,\" said Patience. \"I do\nnot know that any one has quarrelled with you.\"\n\nOf course he would not wait for dinner, nor would he have any lunch.\nHe walked out on to the lawn with something of a bluster in his step,\nand stood there for three or four minutes looking up at the house and\nspeaking to Patience. A young man when he has been rejected by one\nof the young ladies of a family has rather a hard time of it till he\ngets away. \"Well, Patience,\" he said at last, \"make my farewells for\nme.\" And then he was gone.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\n\nHORSELEECHES.\n\n\nThe honour of representing the borough of Percycross in Parliament\nwas very great, and Sir Thomas, no doubt, did enjoy it after a\nfashion; but it was by no means an unalloyed pleasure. While he\nwas still in bed with his broken arm at the Percy Standard, many\napplications for money had been made to him. This man wanted a\nsovereign, that man a five-pound-note, and some poor starving wretch\na half-a-crown; and they all came to him with notes from Trigger,\nor messages from Spicer or Spiveycomb, to the effect that as the\nelection was now over, the money ought to be given. The landlord of\nthe Percy Standard was on such occasions very hard upon him. \"It\nreally will do good, Sir Thomas.\" \"It is wanted, Sir Thomas.\" \"It\nwill make a good feeling in the town, Sir Thomas, and we don't know\nhow soon we may have to go to work again.\" Sir Thomas was too weak in\nhealth to refuse. He gave the sovereigns, the five-pound-notes, and\nthe half-crowns, and hurried back home as quickly as he was able.\n\nBut things were almost worse with him at home than at Percycross.\nThe real horseleeches felt that they could hardly get a good hold\nof him while he was lying at the Percycross inn. Attacks by letter\nwere, they well knew, more fatal than those made personally, and they\nwaited. The first that came was from Mr. Pabsby. Mr. Pabsby had at\nlast seen his way clear, and had voted for Underwood and Westmacott,\nabsolutely throwing away his vote as far as the cause was concerned.\nBut Mr. Pabsby had quarrelled with Griffenbottom, who once, when\npressed hard for some favours, had answered the reverend gentleman\nsomewhat roughly. \"You may go and be ----,\" said Mr. Griffenbottom\nin his wrath, \"and tell everybody in Percycross that I said so.\"\nMr. Pabsby had smiled, had gone away, and had now voted for Mr.\nWestmacott. Mr. Pabsby was indeed a horseleech of the severest\nkind. There had been some outward show of reconciliation between\nGriffenbottom and Pabsby; but Pabsby had at last voted for Underwood\nand Westmacott. Sir Thomas had not been home two days before he\nreceived a letter from Mr. Pabsby. \"It had been with infinite\nsatisfaction,\"--so Mr. Pabsby now said,--\"that he had at length seen\nhis way clearly, and found himself able to support his friend Sir\nThomas. And he believed that he might take upon himself to say that\nwhen he once had seen his way clearly, he had put his shoulder to the\nwheel gallantly.\" In fact, it was to be inferred from the contents of\nMr. Pabsby's letter that Sir Thomas's return had been due altogether\nto Mr. Pabsby's flock, who had, so said Mr. Pabsby, been guided in\nthe matter altogether by his advice. Then he sent a list of his\n\"hearers,\" who had voted for Sir Thomas. From this the slight\nchange of subject needed to bring him to the new chapel which\nhe was building, and his desire that Sir Thomas should head the\nsubscription-list in so good a cause, was easy enough. It might be\ndifficult to say in what Mr. Pabsby's strength lay, but it certainly\nwas the case that the letter was so written as to defy neglect and\nalmost to defy refusal. Such is the power of horseleeches. Sir Thomas\nsent Mr. Pabsby a cheque for twenty pounds, and received Mr. Pabsby's\nacknowledgment, thanking him for his \"first\" subscription. The\nthanks were not very cordial, and it was evident that Mr. Pabsby had\nexpected a good deal more than twenty pounds in return for all that\nhe had done.\n\nMr. Pabsby was simply the first. Before Christmas had come, it seemed\nto Sir Thomas that there was not a place of divine worship in the\nwhole of Percycross that was not falling to the ground in ruins. He\nhad not observed it when he was there, but now it appeared that funds\nwere wanted for almost every such edifice in the borough. And the\nschools were in a most destitute condition. He was informed that the\nsitting member had always subscribed to all the schools, and that if\nhe did not continue such subscription the children would literally be\nrobbed of their education. One gentleman, whose name he did not even\nremember to have heard, simply suggested to him that he would, as\na matter of course, continue to give \"the \u00c2\u00a350\" towards the general\nChristmas collection on behalf of the old women of the borough. The\nsitting members had given it time out of mind. Mr. Roodylands had a\npolitical project of his own, which in fact, if carried out, would\namount to a prohibition on the import of French boots, and suggested\nthat Sir Thomas should bring in a bill to that effect on the meeting\nof Parliament. If Sir Thomas would not object to the trouble of\nvisiting Amiens, Lille, Beauvais, and three or four other French\ntowns which Mr. Roodylands mentioned, he would be able to ascertain\nhow much injury had been done to Percycross by the Cobden treaty.\nMr. Spiveycomb had his own ideas about Italian rags,--Mr. Spiveycomb\nbeing in the paper line,--and wrote a very long letter to Sir Thomas,\npraying the member to make himself master of a subject so vitally\nimportant to the borough which he represented. Mr. Spicer also\ncommunicated to him the astounding fact that some high official\nconnected with the army was undoubtedly misbehaving himself in regard\nto mustard for the troops. The mustard contracts were not open as\nthey should be open. The mustard was all supplied by a London house,\nand Mr. Spicer was very anxious that Sir Thomas should move for a\ncommittee to inquire of the members of that London firm as to the\nmanner in which the contracts were obtained by them. Mr. Spicer was\ndisposed to think that this was the most important matter that would\nbe brought forward in the next session of Parliament.\n\nMr. Pabsby had got his cheque before the other applications were\nreceived; but when they came in shoals, Sir Thomas thought that it\nmight be well to refer them to Mr. Trigger for advice. Sir Thomas had\nnot loved Griffenbottom during the election, and was not inclined to\nask his colleague for counsel. Griffenbottom had obtained a name for\nliberality in Percycross, and had shown symptoms,--so thought Sir\nThomas,--of an intention to use his reputation as a means of throwing\noff further burdens from his own shoulders. \"I have spent a treasure\nin the borough. Let my colleague begin now.\" Words spoken by Mr.\nGriffenbottom in that strain had been repeated to Sir Thomas; and,\nafter many such words, Sir Thomas could not go to Mr. Griffenbottom\nfor advice as to what he should give, or refuse to give. He doubted\nwhether better reliance could be placed on Mr. Trigger;--but to\nsome one he must go for direction. Were he once to let it be known\nin Percycross that demands made would be satisfied, he might sign\ncheques to the extent of his whole fortune, during his first session.\nHe did write to Mr. Trigger, enclosing the various Percycross\napplications; and Mr. Trigger duly replied to him. Mr. Trigger\nregretted that money had been given to Mr. Pabsby. Mr. Pabsby had\nbeen of no use, and could be of no use. Mr. Griffenbottom, who knew\nthe borough better than any one else, had understood this well when\non one occasion he had been \"a little short\" with Mr. Pabsby. Sir\nThomas ought not to have sent that cheque to Mr. Pabsby. The sending\nit would do infinite harm, and cause dissensions in the borough,\nwhich might require a considerable expenditure to set right. As to\nthe other clerical demands, it seemed to Sir Thomas that Mr. Trigger\nwas of opinion that they should all be gratified. He had, in fact,\nsent his money to the only person in Percycross who ought not to have\nreceived money. The \u00c2\u00a350 for the old women was a matter of course,\nand would not be begrudged, as it was the only payment which was\nabsolutely annual. In regard to the schools, Sir Thomas could do\nwhat he pleased; but the sitting members had always been liberal to\nthe schools. Schools were things to which sitting members were, no\ndoubt, expected to subscribe. As to the question of French boots, Mr.\nTrigger thought that there was something in it, and said that if Sir\nThomas could devote his Christmas holidays to getting up the subject\nin Lille and Amiens, it would have a good effect in the borough, and\nshow that he was in earnest. This might be the more desirable, as\nthere was no knowing as yet what might be done about the petition.\nThere no doubt was a strong feeling in the borough as to the Cobden\ntreaty, and Sir Thomas would probably feel it to be his duty to get\nthe question up. In regard to the mustard, Mr. Trigger suggested that\nthough there was probably nothing in it, it might be as well to ask\nthe Secretary at War a question or two on the subject. Mr. Spicer\nwas, no doubt, a moving man in Percycross. Sir Thomas could at\nany rate promise that he would ask such questions, as Mr. Spicer\ncertainly had friends who might be conducive to the withdrawal\nof the petition. Sir Thomas could at any rate put himself into\ncorrespondence with the War Office. Mr. Trigger also thought that\nSir Thomas might judiciously study the subject of Italian rags,\nin reference to the great paper trade of the country. No doubt\nthe manufacture of paper was a growing business at Percycross. Mr.\nTrigger returned all the applications, and ended his letter by\nhinting that the cheques might as well be sent at once. Mr. Trigger\nthought that \"a little money about the borough,\" would do good at the\npresent moment.\n\nIt need hardly be said that this view of things was not pleasant to\nthe sitting member, who was still confined to his house at Fulham\nby an arm broken in the cause. Sir Thomas had at once sent the \u00c2\u00a350\ntowards the Christmas festivities for the poor of the borough, and\nhad declared his purpose of considering the other matters. Then\nhad come a further letter from Mr. Trigger, announcing his journey\nto London, and Mr. Trigger and Sir Thomas had their first meeting\nafter the election, immediately upon Mr. Neefit's departure from the\nchambers. \"And is it to be?\" asked Stemm, as soon as he had closed\nthe door behind Mr. Trigger's back.\n\n\"Is what to be?\"\n\n\"Them petitions, Sir Thomas? Petitions costs a deal of money they\ntell me, Sir Thomas.\" Sir Thomas winced. \"I suppose you must go on\nnow as your hand is in,\" continued Stemm.\n\n\"I don't know that at all,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"You'll find as you must. There ain't no way out of it;--not now as\nyou are the sitting member.\"\n\n\"I am not going to ruin myself, Stemm, for the sake of a seat in\nParliament.\"\n\n\"I don't know how that may be, Sir Thomas. I hope not, Sir Thomas.\nBut I don't see how you're not to go on now, Sir Thomas. If it wasn't\nfor petitions, one wouldn't mind.\"\n\n\"There must be petitions, of course; and if there be good cause for\nthem, they should succeed.\"\n\n\"No doubt, Sir Thomas. They say the bribery at Percycross was\ntremenjous;--but I suppose it was on the other side.\"\n\n\"If it was on our side, Stemm, it was not so with my knowledge. I did\nall I could to prevent it. I spoke against it whenever I opened my\nmouth. I would not have given a shilling for a single vote, though it\nwould have got me the election.\"\n\n\"But they were not all that way, Sir Thomas;--was they?\"\n\n\"How can I tell? No;--I know that they were not. I fear they were\nnot. I cannot say that money was given, but I fear it.\"\n\n\"You must go on now, Sir Thomas, any way,\" said Stemm with a groan\nthat was not reassuring.\n\n\"I wish I had never heard the name of Percycross,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"I dare say,\" replied Stemm.\n\n\"I went there determined to keep my hands clean.\"\n\n\"When one puts one's hand into other people's business, they won't\ncome out clean,\" said the judicious Stemm. \"But you must go on with\nit now, any way, Sir Thomas.\"\n\n\"I don't know what I shall do,\" said the unhappy member.\n\nOn the next morning there came another application from Percycross.\nThe postmaster in that town had died suddenly, and the competitors\nfor the situation, which was worth about \u00c2\u00a3150 per annum, were very\nnumerous. There was a certain Mr. O'Blather, only known in Percycross\nas cousin to one Mrs. Givantake, the wife of a liberal solicitor in\nthe borough. Of Mr. O'Blather the worst that could be said was that\nat the age of forty he had no income on which to support himself.\nMrs. Givantake was attached to her cousin, and Mr. Givantake had\nbecome sensible of a burden. That the vacant office was just\nthe thing for him appeared at a glance to all his friends. Mrs.\nGivantake, in her energy on the subject, expressed an opinion that\nthe whole Cabinet should be impeached if the just claims of Mr.\nO'Blather were not conceded. But it was felt that the justice of\nthe claims would not prevail without personal interest. The liberal\nparty was in power, and application, hot and instant, was made to Mr.\nWestmacott. Mr. Westmacott was happy enough to have his answer ready.\nThe Treasury had nothing to do with the matter. It was a Post Office\nconcern; and he, simply as the late liberal member, and last liberal\ncandidate for the borough, was not entitled to intrude, even in a\nmatter of patronage, upon the Postmaster-General, with whom he was\nnot acquainted. But Mr. Westmacott was malicious as well as secure.\nHe added a postscript to his letter, in which he said that he\nbelieved the present sitting member, Sir Thomas Underwood, was\nintimately acquainted with the noble lord who presided at the Post\nOffice. There were various interests at Percycross moved, brought\ntogether, weighed against each other, and balanced to a grain,\nand finally dovetailed. If Sir Thomas Underwood would prevail on\nLord ---- to appoint Mr. O'Blather to the vacant office, then all\nthe Givantake influence at Percycross should be used towards the\nwithdrawal of the petition. Such was the communication now made to\nSir Thomas by a gentleman who signed his name as Peter Piper, and who\nprofessed himself authorised to act on behalf of Mr. Givantake. Sir\nThomas's answer was as follows;--\n\n\n   Southampton Buildings, December 31, 186--.\n\n   SIR,--\n\n   I can have nothing to do with Mr. O'Blather and the\n   post-office at Percycross.\n\n   I am,\n   Your obedient servant,\n\n   THOMAS UNDERWOOD.\n\n   MR. PETER PIPER, Post-office, Percycross.\n\n\nChristmas had passed,--and had passed uncomfortably enough at Popham\nVilla, in which retreat neither of the three young ladies was at\npresent very happy,--when Sir Thomas was invited by Mr. Trigger\nto take further steps with reference to the petitions. It was\nthought necessary that there should be a meeting in the conservative\ninterest, and it was suggested that this meeting should take place in\nSir Thomas's chambers. Mr. Trigger in making the proposition seemed\nto imply that a great favour was thereby conferred on Sir Thomas,--as\nthat country is supposed to be most honoured which is selected\nas the meeting-ground for plenipotentiaries when some important\ninternational point requires to be settled. Sir Thomas could not see\nthe arrangement in that light, and would have shuffled out of the\nhonour had it been possible. But it was not possible. At this period\nof the year Mr. Griffenbottom had no house in town, and Mr. Trigger\nexplained that it was inexpedient that such meetings should take\nplace at hotels. There was no place so fitting as a lawyer's\nchambers. Sir Thomas, who regarded as a desecration the entrance\nof one such man as Mr. Trigger into his private room, and who\nwas particularly anxious not to fall into any intimacy with Mr.\nGriffenbottom, was driven to consent, and at one o'clock on the\n29th, Stemm was forced to admit the deputation. The deputation from\nPercycross consisted of Mr. Trigger, Mr. Spicer, and Mr. Pile; but\nwith them came also the senior sitting member. At first they were all\nvery grave, and Sir Thomas asked them, indiscreetly, whether they\nwould take a glass of sherry. Pile and Spicer immediately acceded\nto this proposition, and sherry was perhaps efficacious in bringing\nabout speedy conversation.\n\n\"Well, Underwood,\" said Mr. Griffenbottom, \"it seems that after all\nwe are to have these d---- petitions.\" Sir Thomas lifted his left\nfoot on his right knee, and nursed his leg,--but said nothing. On one\npoint he was resolved;--nothing on earth should induce him to call\nhis colleague Griffenbottom.\n\n\"No doubt about that, Mr. Griffenbottom,\" said Mr. Pile, \"--that is,\nunless we can make Westmacott right. T'other chap wouldn't be of much\naccount.\"\n\n\"Mr. Pile, you're going a little too fast,\" said Trigger.\n\n\"No, I ain't,\" said Mr. Pile. But for the moment he allowed himself\nto be silenced.\n\n\"We don't like the looks of it at Percycross,\" said Mr. Spicer.\n\n\"And why don't we like the looks of it?\" asked Sir Thomas.\n\n\"I don't know what your idea of pleasure is,\" said Mr. Griffenbottom,\n\"but I don't take delight in spending money for nothing. I have spent\nenough, I can tell you, and I don't mean to spend much more. My seat\nwas as safe as the Church.\"\n\n\"But they have petitioned against that as well as mine,\" said Sir\nThomas.\n\n\"Yes;--they have. And now what's to be done?\"\n\n\"I don't know whether Sir Thomas is willing to take the whole cost of\nthe defence upon himself,\" said Mr. Trigger, pouring out for himself\na second glass of sherry.\n\n\"No, I am not,\" said Sir Thomas. Whereupon there was a pause, during\nwhich Pile and Spicer also took second glasses of sherry. \"Why should\nI pay the cost of defending Mr. Griffenbottom's seat?\"\n\n\"Why should I pay it?\" said Griffenbottom. \"My seat was safe enough.\nThe fact is, if money was paid,--as to which I know nothing,--it was\npaid to get the second seat. Everybody knows that. Why should any\none have paid money for me? I was safe. I never have any difficulty;\neverybody knows that. I could come in for Percycross twenty times\nrunning, without buying a vote. Isn't that true, Trigger?\"\n\n\"I believe you could, Mr. Griffenbottom.\"\n\n\"Of course I could. Look here, Underwood--\"\n\n\"I beg your pardon for one moment, Mr. Griffenbottom,\" said Sir\nThomas. \"Will you tell me, Mr. Trigger, whether votes were bought\non my behalf?\" Mr. Trigger smiled, and put his head on one side,\nbut made no answer. \"I wish I might be allowed to hear the truth,\"\ncontinued Sir Thomas. Whereupon Spicer grinned, and Mr. Pile looked\nas though he were about to be sick. How was it that a set of\ngentlemen, who generally knew their business so well as did the\npolitical leaders at Percycross, had got themselves into the same\nboat with a man silly enough to ask such a question as that?\n\n\"I shan't spend money,\" said Griffenbottom; \"it's out of the\nquestion. They can't touch me. I've spent my money, and got my\narticle. If others want the article, they must spend theirs.\"\n\nMr. Trigger thought it might be as well to change the subject for a\nmoment, or, at any rate, to pass on to another clause of the same\nbill. \"I was very sorry, Sir Thomas,\" said he, \"that you wrote that\nletter to Mr. Givantake.\"\n\n\"I wrote no letter to Mr. Givantake. A man named Piper addressed me.\"\n\n\"Well, well, well; that's the same thing. It was Givantake, though of\ncourse he isn't going to sign his name to everything. If you could\njust have written a line to your friend the Postmaster-General, I\nreally think we could have squared it all.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't have made a request so improper for all Percycross,\" said\nSir Thomas.\n\n\"Patronage is open to everybody,\" suggested Mr. Griffenbottom.\n\n\"Those sort of favours are asked every day,\" said Trigger.\n\n\"We live in a free country,\" said Spicer.\n\n\"Givantake is a d---- scoundrel all the same,\" said Mr. Pile; \"and\nas for his wife's Irish cousin, I should be very sorry to leave my\nletters in his hands.\"\n\n\"It wouldn't have come off, Mr. Pile,\" said Trigger, \"but the request\nmight have been made. If Sir Thomas will allow me to say as much, the\nrequest ought to have been made.\"\n\n\"I will allow nothing of the kind, Mr. Trigger,\" said Sir Thomas,\nwith an assumption of personal dignity which caused everyone in the\nroom to alter his position in his chair. \"I understand these things\nare given by merit.\" Mr. Trigger smiled, and Mr. Griffenbottom\nlaughed outright. \"At any rate, they ought to be, and in this office\nI believe they are.\" Mr. Griffenbottom, who had had the bestowal of\nsome local patronage, laughed again.\n\n\"The thing is over now, at any rate,\" said Mr. Trigger.\n\n\"I saw Givantake yesterday,\" said Spicer. \"He won't stir a finger\nnow.\"\n\n\"He never would have stirred a finger,\" said Mr. Pile; \"and if he'd\nstirred both his fistesses, he wouldn't have done a ha'porth of good.\nGivantake, indeed! He be blowed!\" There was a species of honesty\nabout Mr. Pile which almost endeared him to Sir Thomas.\n\n\"Something must be settled,\" said Trigger.\n\n\"I thought you'd got a proposition to make,\" said Spicer.\n\n\"Well, Sir Thomas,\" began Mr. Trigger, as it were girding his loins\nfor the task before him, \"we think that your seat wouldn't stand\nthe brunt. We've been putting two and two together and that's what\nwe think.\" A very black cloud came over the brow of Sir Thomas\nUnderwood, but at the moment he said nothing. \"Of course it can be\ndefended. If you choose to fight the battle you can defend it. It\nwill cost about \u00c2\u00a31,500,--or perhaps a little more. That is, the two\nsides, for both will have to be paid.\" Mr. Trigger paused again, but\nstill Sir Thomas said not a word. \"Mr. Griffenbottom thinks that he\nshould not be asked to take any part of this cost.\"\n\n\"Not a shilling,\" said Mr. Griffenbottom.\n\n\"Well,\" continued Mr. Trigger, \"that being the case, of course we\nhave got to see what will be our best plan of action. I suppose, Sir\nThomas, you are not altogether indifferent about the money.\"\n\n\"By no means,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"I don't know who is. Money is money all the world over.\"\n\n\"You may say that,\" put in Mr. Spicer.\n\n\"Just let me go on for a moment, Mr. Spicer, till I make this thing\nclear to Sir Thomas. That's how we stand at present. It will cost\nus,--that is to say you,--about \u00c2\u00a31,500, and we should do no good. I\nreally don't think we should do any good. Here are these judges, and\nyou know that new brooms sweep clean. I suppose we may allow that\nthere was a little money spent somewhere. They do say now that a\nglass of beer would lose a seat.\"\n\nSir Thomas could not but remember all that he had said to prevent\nthere being even a glass of beer, and the way in which he had\nbeen treated by all the party in that matter, because he had so\nendeavoured. But it was useless to refer to all that at the present\nmoment. \"It seems to me,\" he said, \"that if one seat be vacated, both\nmust be vacated.\"\n\n\"It doesn't follow at all,\" said Mr. Griffenbottom.\n\n\"Allow me just for a moment longer,\" continued Trigger, who rose from\nhis seat as he came to the real gist of his speech. \"A proposition\nhas been made to us, Sir Thomas, and I am able to say that it is\none which may be trusted. Of course our chief anxiety is for the\nparty. You feel that, Sir Thomas, of course.\" Sir Thomas would not\ncondescend to make any reply to this. \"Now the Liberals will be\ncontent with one seat. If we go on it will lead to disfranchising the\nborough, and we none of us want that. It would be no satisfaction\nto you, Sir Thomas, to be the means of robbing the borough of its\nprivilege after all that the borough has done for you.\"\n\n\"Go on, Mr. Trigger,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"The Liberals only want one seat. If you'll undertake to accept\nthe Hundreds, the petition will be withdrawn, and Mr. Westmacott\nwill come forward again. In that case we shouldn't oppose. Now, Sir\nThomas, you know what the borough thinks will be the best course for\nall of us to pursue.\"\n\nSir Thomas did know. We may say that he had known for some minutes\npast. He had perceived what was coming, and various recollections had\nfloated across his mind. He especially remembered that \u00c2\u00a350 for the\npoor old women which Mr. Trigger only a week since had recommended\nthat he should give,--and he remembered also that he had given it.\nHe recollected the sum which he had already paid for his election\nexpenses, as to which Mr. Trigger had been very careful to get\nthe money before this new proposition was made. He remembered Mr.\nPabsby and his cheque for \u00c2\u00a320. He remembered his broken arm, and\nthat fortnight of labour and infinite vexation in the borough. He\nremembered all his hopes, and his girls' triumph. But he remembered\nalso that he had told himself a dozen times since his return that he\nwished that he might rid himself altogether of Percycross and the\nseat in Parliament. Now a proposition that would have this effect was\nmade to him.\n\n\"Well, Sir Thomas, what do you think of it?\" asked Mr. Trigger.\n\nSir Thomas required the passing of a few moments that he might think\nof it, and yet there was a feeling strong at his heart telling him\nthat it behoved him not even to seem to doubt. He was a man not\ndeficient in spirit when roused as he now was roused. He knew that he\nwas being ill used. From the first moment of his entering Percycross\nhe had felt that the place was not fit for him, that it required a\nmethod of canvassing of which he was not only ignorant, but desirous\nto remain ignorant,--that at Percycross he would only be a catspaw in\nthe hands of other men. He knew that he could not safely get into the\nsame boat with Mr. Griffenbottom, or trust himself to the steering of\nsuch a coxswain as Mr. Trigger. He had found that there could be no\nsympathy between himself and any one of those who constituted his own\nparty in the borough. And yet he had persevered. He had persevered\nbecause in such matters it is so difficult to choose the moment in\nwhich to recede. He had persevered,--and had attained a measure of\nsuccess. As far as had been possible for him to do so, he had fought\nhis battle with clean hands, and now he was member of Parliament for\nPercycross. Let what end there might come to this petition,--even\nthough his seat should be taken from him,--he could be subjected to\nno personal disgrace. He could himself give evidence, the truth of\nwhich no judge in the land would doubt, as to the purity of his own\nintentions, and as to the struggle to be pure which he had made. And\nnow they asked him to give way in order that Mr. Griffenbottom might\nkeep his seat!\n\nHe felt that he and poor Moggs had been fools together. At this\nmoment there came upon him a reflection that such men as he and Moggs\nwere unable to open their mouths in such a borough as Percycross\nwithout having their teeth picked out of their jaws. He remembered\nwell poor Moggs's legend, \"Moggs, Purity, and the Rights of Labour;\"\nand he remembered thinking at the time that neither Moggs nor he\nshould have come to Percycross. And now he was told of all that the\nborough had done for him, and was requested to show his gratitude by\ngiving up his seat,--in order that Griffenbottom might still be a\nmember of Parliament, and that Percycross might not be disfranchised!\nDid he feel any gratitude to Percycross or any love to Mr.\nGriffenbottom? In his heart he desired that Mr. Griffenbottom might\nbe made to retire into private life, and he knew that it would be\nwell that the borough should be disfranchised.\n\nThese horrid men that sat around him,--how he hated them! He could\nget rid of them now, now and for ever, by acceding to the proposition\nmade to him. And he thought that in doing so he could speak a few\nwords which would be very agreeable to him in the speaking. And then\nall that Mr. Trigger had said about the \u00c2\u00a31,500 had been doubtless\ntrue. If he defended his seat money must be spent, and he did not\nknow how far he might be able to compel Mr. Griffenbottom to share\nthe expense. He was not so rich but what he was bound to think of the\nmoney, for his children's sake. And he did believe Mr. Trigger, when\nMr. Trigger told him that the seat could not be saved.\n\nYet he could not bring himself to let these men have their way with\nhim. To have to confess that he had been their tool went so much\nagainst the grain with him that anything seemed to him to be\npreferable to that. The passage across his brain of all these\nthoughts had not required many seconds, and his guests seemed to\nacknowledge by their silence that some little space of time should be\nallowed to him. Mr. Pile was leaning forward on his stick with his\neyes fixed upon Sir Thomas's face. Mr. Spicer was amusing himself\nwith a third glass of sherry. Mr. Griffenbottom had assumed a look of\nabsolute indifference, and was sitting with his eyes fixed upon the\nceiling. Mr. Trigger, with a pleasant smile on his face, was leaning\nback in his chair with his hands in his trousers pockets. He had done\nhis disagreeable job of work, and upon the whole he thought that he\nhad done it well.\n\n\"I shall do nothing of the kind,\" said Sir Thomas at last.\n\n\"You'll be wrong, Sir Thomas,\" said Mr. Trigger.\n\n\"You'll disfranchise the borough,\" said Mr. Spicer.\n\n\"You'll not be able to keep your seat,\" said Mr. Trigger.\n\n\"And there'll be all the money to pay,\" said Mr. Spicer.\n\n\"Sir Thomas don't mind that,\" said Mr. Griffenbottom.\n\n\"As for paying the money, I do mind it very much,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\"As for disfranchising the borough, I cannot say that I regard it in\nthe least. As to your seat, Mr. Griffenbottom--\"\n\n\"My seat is quite safe,\" said the senior member.\n\n\"As to your seat, which I am well aware must be jeopardised if mine\nbe in jeopardy, it would have been matter of more regret to me, had\nI experienced from you any similar sympathy for myself. As it is, it\nseems that each of us is to do the best he can for himself, and I\nshall do the best I can for myself. Good morning.\"\n\n\"What then do you mean to do?\" said Mr. Trigger.\n\n\"On that matter I shall prefer to converse with my friends.\"\n\n\"You mean,\" said Mr. Trigger, \"that you will put it into other\nhands.\"\n\n\"You have made a proposition to me, Mr. Trigger, and I have given you\nmy answer. I have nothing else to say. What steps I may take I do not\neven know at present.\"\n\n\"You will let us hear from you,\" said Mr. Trigger.\n\n\"I cannot say that I will.\"\n\n\"This comes of bringing a gentleman learned in the law down into the\nborough,\" said Mr. Griffenbottom.\n\n\"Gentlemen, I must ask you to leave me,\" said Sir Thomas, rising from\nhis chair and ringing the bell.\n\n\"Look here, Sir Thomas Underwood,\" said Mr. Griffenbottom. \"This to\nme is a very important matter.\"\n\n\"And to me also,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"I do not know anything about that. Like a good many others, you may\nlike to have a seat in Parliament, and may like to get it without any\ntrouble and without any money. I have sat for Percycross for many\nyears, and have spent a treasure, and have worked myself off my legs.\nI don't know that I care much for anything except for keeping my\nplace in the House. The House is everything to me,--meat and drink;\nemployment and recreation; and I can tell you I'm not going to lose\nmy seat if I can help it. You came in for the second chance, Sir\nThomas; and a very good second chance it was if you'd just have\nallowed others who knew what they were about to manage matters for\nyou. That chance is over now, and according to all rules that ever I\nheard of in such matters, you ought to surrender. Isn't that so, Mr.\nTrigger?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Mr. Griffenbottom, according to my ideas,\" said Mr.\nTrigger.\n\n\"That's about it,\" said Mr. Spicer.\n\nSir Thomas was still standing. Indeed they were all standing now.\n\"Mr. Griffenbottom,\" he said, \"I have nothing further that I can\nsay at the present moment. To the offer made to me by Mr. Trigger I\nat present positively decline to accede. I look upon that offer as\nunfriendly, and can therefore only wish you a good morning.\"\n\n\"Unfriendly,\" said Mr. Griffenbottom with a sneer.\n\n\"Good-bye, Sir Thomas,\" said Mr. Pile, putting out his hand. Sir\nThomas shook hands with Mr. Pile cordially. \"It's my opinion that\nhe's right,\" said Mr. Pile. \"I don't like his notions, but I do like\nhis pluck. Good-bye, Sir Thomas.\" Then Mr. Pile led the way out of\nthe room, and the others followed him.\n\n\"Oh!\" said Stemm, as soon as he had shut the door behind their backs.\n\"That's a deputation from Percycross, is it, Sir Thomas? You were\nsaying as how you didn't quite approve of the Percycrossians.\" To\nthis, however, Sir Thomas vouchsafed no reply.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL.\n\nWHAT SIR THOMAS THOUGHT ABOUT IT.\n\n\nSir Thomas Underwood had been engaged upon a very great piece of work\never since he had been called to the Bar in the twenty-fifth year of\nhis life. He had then devoted himself to the writing of a life of\nLord Verulam, and had been at it ever since. But as yet he had not\nwritten a word. In early life, that is, up to his fortieth year,\nhe had talked freely enough about his opus magnum to those of his\ncompeers with whom he had been intimate; but of late Bacon's name had\nnever been on his lips. Patience, at home, was aware of the name and\nnature of her father's occupation, but Clarissa had not yet learned\nto know that he who had been the great philosopher and little Lord\nChancellor was not to be lightly mentioned. To Stemm the matter had\nbecome so serious, that in speaking of books, papers, and documents\nhe would have recourse to any periphrasis rather than mention in his\nmaster's hearing the name of the fallen angel. And yet Sir Thomas was\nalways talking to himself about Sir Francis Bacon, and was always\nwriting his life.\n\nThere are men who never dream of great work, who never realise to\nthemselves the need of work so great as to demand a lifetime, but who\nthemselves never fail in accomplishing those second-class tasks with\nwhich they satisfy their own energies. Men these are who to the world\nare very useful. Some few there are, who seeing the beauty of a great\nwork and believing in its accomplishment within the years allotted\nto man, are contented to struggle for success, and struggling, fail.\nHere and there comes one who struggles and succeeds. But the men are\nmany who see the beauty, who adopt the task, who promise themselves\nthe triumph, and then never struggle at all. The task is never\nabandoned; but days go by and weeks; and then months and years,--and\nnothing is done. The dream of youth becomes the doubt of middle life,\nand then the despair of age. In building a summer-house it is so easy\nto plant the first stick, but one does not know where to touch the\nsod when one begins to erect a castle. So it had been with Sir Thomas\nUnderwood and his life of Bacon. It would not suffice to him to\nscrape together a few facts, to indulge in some fiction, to tell a\nfew anecdotes, and then to call his book a biography. Here was a man\nwho had risen higher and was reported to have fallen lower,--perhaps\nthan any other son of Adam. With the finest intellect ever given to\na man, with the purest philanthropy and the most enduring energy, he\nhad become a by-word for greed and injustice. Sir Thomas had resolved\nthat he would tell the tale as it had never yet been told, that he\nwould unravel facts that had never seen the light, that he would let\nthe world know of what nature really had been this man,--and that\nhe would write a book that should live. He had never abandoned his\npurpose; and now at sixty years of age, his purpose remained with\nhim, but not one line of his book was written.\n\nAnd yet the task had divorced him in a measure from the world. He\nhad not been an unsuccessful man in life. He had made money, and had\nrisen nearly to the top of his profession. He had been in Parliament,\nand was even now a member. But yet he had been divorced from\nthe world, and Bacon had done it. By Bacon he had justified to\nhimself,--or rather had failed to justify to himself,--a seclusion\nfrom his family and from the world which had been intended for\nstrenuous work, but had been devoted to dilettante idleness. And he\nhad fallen into those mistakes which such habits and such pursuits\nare sure to engender. He thought much, but he thought nothing out,\nand was consequently at sixty still in doubt about almost everything.\nWhether Christ did or did not die to save sinners was a question\nwith him so painfully obscure that he had been driven to obtain what\ncomfort he might from not thinking of it. The assurance of belief\ncertainly was not his to enjoy;--nor yet that absence from fear which\nmay come from assured unbelief. And yet none who knew him could say\nthat he was a bad man. He robbed no one. He never lied. He was not\nself-indulgent. He was affectionate. But he had spent his life in an\nintention to write the life of Lord Verulam, and not having done it,\nhad missed the comfort of self-respect. He had intended to settle\nfor himself a belief on subjects which are, of all, to all men the\nmost important; and, having still postponed the work of inquiry, had\nnever attained the security of a faith. He was for ever doubting, for\never intending, and for ever despising himself for his doubts and\nunaccomplished intentions. Now, at the age of sixty, he had thought\nto lessen these inward disturbances by returning to public life, and\nhis most unsatisfactory alliance with Mr. Griffenbottom had been the\nresult.\n\nThey who know the agonies of an ambitious, indolent, doubting,\nself-accusing man,--of a man who has a skeleton in his cupboard\nas to which he can ask for sympathy from no one,--will understand\nwhat feelings were at work within the bosom of Sir Thomas when his\nPercycross friends left him alone in his chamber. The moment that he\nknew that he was alone he turned the lock of the door, and took from\nout a standing desk a whole heap of loose papers. These were the\nlatest of his notes on the great Bacon subject. For though no line\nof the book had ever been written,--nor had his work even yet taken\nsuch form as to enable him to write a line,--nevertheless, he always\nhad by him a large assemblage of documents, notes, queries, extracts\ninnumerable, and references which in the course of years had become\nalmost unintelligible to himself, upon which from time to time he\nwould set himself to work. Whenever he was most wretched he would fly\nat his papers. When the qualms of his conscience became very severe,\nhe would copy some passage from a dusty book, hardly in the belief\nthat it might prove to be useful, but with half a hope that he might\ncheat himself into so believing. Now, in his misery, he declared\nthat he would bind himself to his work and never leave it. There, if\nanywhere, might consolation be found.\n\nWith rapid hands he moved about the papers, and tried to fix his eyes\nupon the words. But how was he to fix his thoughts? He could not even\nbegin not to think of those scoundrels who had so misused him. It\nwas not a week since they had taken \u00c2\u00a350 from him for the poor of\nPercycross, and now they came to him with a simple statement that he\nwas absolutely to be thrown over! He had already paid \u00c2\u00a3900 for his\nelection, and was well aware that the account was not closed. And\nhe was a man who could not bear to speak about money, or to make\nany complaint as to money. Even though he was being so abominably\nmisused, still he must pay any further claim that might be made on\nhim in respect of the election that was past. Yes;--he must pay for\nthose very purchased votes, for that bribery, as to which he had so\nloudly expressed his abhorrence, and by reason of which he was now to\nlose his seat with ignominy.\n\nBut the money was not the worst of it. There was a heavier sorrow\nthan that arising from the loss of his money. He alone had been just\nthroughout the contest at Percycross; he alone had been truthful,\nand he alone straightforward! And yet he alone must suffer! He began\nto believe that Griffenbottom would keep his seat. That he would\ncertainly lose his own, he was quite convinced. He might lose it\nby undergoing an adverse petition, and paying ever so much more\nmoney,--or he might lose it in the manner that Mr. Trigger had\nso kindly suggested. In either way there would be disgrace, and\ncontumely, and hours of the agony of self-reproach in store for him!\n\nWhat excuse had he for placing himself in contact with such filth? Of\nwhat childishness had he not been the victim when he allowed himself\nto dream that he, a pure and scrupulous man, could go among such\nimpurity as he had found at Percycross, and come out, still clean\nand yet triumphant? Then he thought of Griffenbottom as a member of\nParliament, and of that Legislation and that Constitution to which\nGriffenbottoms were thought to be essentially necessary. That there\nare always many such men in the House he had always known. He had sat\nthere and had seen them. He had stood shoulder to shoulder with them\nthrough many a division, and had thought about them,--acknowledging\ntheir use. But now that he was brought into personal contact with\nsuch an one, his very soul was aghast. The Griffenbottoms never do\nanything in politics. They are men of whom in the lump it may be\nsurmised that they take up this or that side in politics, not from\nany instructed conviction, not from faith in measures or even in men,\nnor from adherence either through reason or prejudice to this or that\nset of political theories,--but simply because on this side or on\nthat there is an opening. That gradually they do grow into some shape\nof conviction from the moulds in which they are made to live, must\nbe believed of them; but these convictions are convictions as to\ndivisions, convictions as to patronage, convictions as to success,\nconvictions as to Parliamentary management; but not convictions as\nto the political needs of the people. So said Sir Thomas to himself\nas he sat thinking of the Griffenbottoms. In former days he had told\nhimself that a pudding cannot be made without suet or dough, and\nthat Griffenbottoms were necessary if only for the due adherence of\nthe plums. Whatever most health-bestowing drug the patient may take\nwould bestow anything but health were it taken undiluted. It was\nthus in former days Sir Thomas had apologised to himself for the\nGriffenbottoms in the House;--but no such apology satisfied him now.\nThis log of a man, this lump of suet, this diluting quantity of most\nimpure water,--'twas thus that Mr. Griffenbottom was spoken of by Sir\nThomas to himself as he sat there with all the Bacon documents before\nhim,--this politician, whose only real political feeling consisted in\na positive love of corruption for itself, had not only absolutely got\nthe better of him, who regarded himself at any rate as a man of mind\nand thought, but had used him as a puppet, and had compelled him\nto do dirty work. Oh,--that he should have been so lost to his own\nself-respect as to have allowed himself to be dragged through the\ndirt of Percycross!\n\nBut he must do something;--he must take some step. Mr. Griffenbottom\nhad declared that he would put himself to no expense in defending the\nseat. Of course he, Sir Thomas, could do the same. He believed that\nit might be practicable for him to acknowledge the justice of the\npetition, to declare his belief that his own agents had betrayed him,\nand to acknowledge that his seat was indefensible. But, as he thought\nof it, he found that he was actually ignorant of the law in the\nmatter. That he would make no such bargain as that suggested\nto him by Mr. Trigger,--of so much he thought that he was sure.\nAt any rate he would do nothing that he himself knew to be\ndishonourable. He must consult his own attorney. That was the end\nof his self-deliberation,--that, and a conviction that under no\ncircumstances could he retain his seat.\n\nThen he struggled hard for an hour to keep his mind fixed on the\nsubject of his great work. He had found an unknown memoir respecting\nBacon, written by a German pen in the Latin language, published at\nLeipzig shortly after the date of Bacon's fall. He could translate\nthat. It is always easiest for the mind to work in such emergencies,\non some matter as to which no creative struggles are demanded from\nit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI.\n\nA BROKEN HEART.\n\n\nIt was very bad with Clarissa when Ralph Newton was closeted with\nMary at Popham Villa. She had suspected what was about to take place,\nwhen Sir Thomas and Ralph went together into the room; but at that\nmoment she said nothing. She endeavoured to seem to be cheerful, and\nattempted to joke with Mary. The three girls were sitting at the\ntable on which lunch was spread,--a meal which no one was destined\nto eat at Popham Villa on that day,--and thus they remained till Sir\nThomas joined them. \"Mary,\" he had said, \"Ralph Newton wishes to\nspeak to you. You had better go to him.\"\n\n\"To me, uncle?\"\n\n\"Yes, to you. You had better go to him.\"\n\n\"But I had rather not.\"\n\n\"Of course you must do as you please, but I would advise you to go to\nhim.\" Then she had risen very slowly and had gone.\n\nAll of them had understood what it meant. To Clarissa the thing\nwas as certain as though she already heard the words spoken. With\nPatience even there was no doubt. Sir Thomas, though he had told\nnothing, did not pretend that the truth was to be hidden. He looked\nat his younger daughter sorrowfully, and laid his hand upon her\nhead caressingly. With her there was no longer the possibility of\nretaining any secret, hardly the remembrance that there was a secret\nto retain. \"Oh, papa,\" she said;--\"oh, papa!\" and burst into tears.\n\n\"My dear,\" he said, \"believe me that it is best that it should be\nso. He is unworthy.\" Patience said not a word, but was now holding\nClarissa close to her bosom. \"Tell Mary,\" continued Sir Thomas, \"that\nI will see her when she is at liberty. Patience, you can ask Ralph\nwhether it will suit him to stay for dinner. I am tired and will go\nup-stairs myself.\" And so the two girls were left together.\n\n\"Patty, take me away,\" said Clarissa. \"I must never see him\nagain,--never!--nor her.\"\n\n\"She will not accept him, Clary.\"\n\n\"Yes, she will. I know she will. She is a sly, artful creature. And I\nhave been so good to her.\"\n\n\"No, Clary;--I think not;--but what does it matter? He is unworthy.\nHe can be nothing to you now. Papa was right. He is unworthy.\"\n\n\"I care nothing for that. I only care for him. Oh, Patty, take me\naway. I could not bear to see them when they come out.\"\n\nThen Patience took her sister up to their joint room, and laid the\npoor sufferer on the bed, and throwing herself on her knees beside\nthe bed, wept over her sister and caressed her. That argument of\nRalph's unworthiness was nothing to Clarissa. She did not consider\nherself to be so worthy but what she might forgive any sin, if only\nthe chance of forgiving such sin were given to her. At this moment in\nher heart of hearts her anger was more against her rival than against\nthe man. She had not yet taught herself to think of all his baseness\nto her,--had only as yet had time to think that that evil had come\nupon her which she had feared from the first moment of her cousin's\narrival.\n\nPresently Patience heard the door opened of the room down-stairs\nand heard Mary's slow step as she crossed the hall. She understood\nwell that some one should be below, and with another single word of\naffection to her sister, she went down-stairs. \"Well, Mary,\" she\nsaid, looking into her cousin's face.\n\n\"There is nothing particular to tell,\" said Mary, with a gentle\nsmile.\n\n\"Of course we all knew what he wanted.\"\n\n\"Then of course you all knew what I should say to him.\"\n\n\"I knew,\" said Patience.\n\n\"I am sure that Clary knew,\" said Mary. \"But he is all alone there,\nand will not know what to do with himself. Won't you go to him?\"\n\n\"You will go up to Clary?\" Mary nodded her head, and then Patience\ncrossed the hall to liberate the rejected suitor. Mary stood for\nawhile thinking. She already knew from what Patience had said, that\nClarissa had suspected her, and she felt that there should have been\nno such suspicion. Clarissa had not understood, but ought to have\nunderstood. For a moment she was angry, and was disposed to go to\nher own room. Then she remembered all her cousin's misery, and crept\nup-stairs to the door. She had come so softly, that though the door\nwas hardly closed, nothing had been heard of her approach. \"May I\ncome in, dear?\" she said very gently.\n\n\"Well, Mary; tell me all,\" said Clarissa.\n\n\"There is nothing to tell, Clary;--only this, that I fear Mr. Newton\nis not worthy of your love.\"\n\n\"He asked you to take him?\"\n\n\"Never mind, dearest. We will not talk of that. Dear, dearest Clary,\nif I only could make you happy.\"\n\n\"But you have refused him?\"\n\n\"Don't you know me better than to ask me? Don't you know where my\nheart is? We will carry our burdens together, dearest, and then they\nwill be lighter.\"\n\n\"But he will come to you again;--that other one.\"\n\n\"Clary, dear; we will not think about it. There are things which\nshould not be thought of. We will not talk of it, but we will love\neach other so dearly.\" Clarissa, now that she was assured that her\nevil fortune was not to be aggravated by any injury done to her by\nher cousin, allowed herself to be tranquillised if not comforted.\nThere was indeed something in her position that did not admit of\ncomfort. All the family knew the story of her unrequited love,\nand treated her with a compassion which, while its tenderness was\npleasant to her, was still in itself an injury. A vain attachment in\na woman's heart must ever be a weary load, because she can take no\nstep of her own towards that consummation by which the burden may be\nconverted into a joy. A man may be active, may press his suit even a\ntenth time, may do something towards achieving success. A woman can\nonly be still and endure. But Clarissa had so managed her affairs\nthat even that privilege of being still was hardly left to her. Her\ntrouble was known to them all. She doubted whether even the servants\nin the house did not know the cause of her woe. How all this had\ncome to pass she could not now remember. She had told Patience,--as\nthough in compliance with some compact that each should ever tell the\nother all things. And then circumstances had arisen which made it so\nnatural that she should be open and candid with Mary. The two Ralphs\nwere to be their two lovers. That to her had been a delightful dream\nduring the last few months. He, whose inheritance at that moment was\nsupposed to have been gone, had, as Clarissa thought, in plainest\nlanguage told his love to her. \"Dear, dear Clary, you know I love\nyou.\" The words to her sense had been so all-important, had meant\nso much, had seemed to be so final, that they hardly wanted further\ncorroboration. Then, indeed, had come the great fault,--the fault\nwhich she had doubted whether she could ever pardon; and she, because\nof the heinousness of that offence, had been unable to answer the\nquestion that had been asked. But the offence, such as it was, had\nnot lightened the solemnity of her assurance, as far as love went,\nthat Ralph ought to be her own after the speaking of such words as he\nhad spoken. There were those troubles about money, but yet she was\nentitled to regard him as her own. Then had come the written offer\nfrom the other Ralph to Mary,--the offer written in the moment of\nhis believed prosperity; and it had been so natural that Clarissa\nshould tell her cousin that as regarded the splendour of position\nthere should be no jealousy between them. Clarissa did not herself\nthink much of a lover who wrote letters instead of coming and\nspeaking,--had perhaps an idea that open speech, even though offence\nmight follow, was better than formal letters; but all that was Mary's\naffair. This very respectful Ralph was Mary's lover, and if Mary were\nsatisfied, she would not quarrel with the well-behaved young man. She\nwould not even quarrel with him because he was taking from her own\nRalph the inheritance which for so many years had been believed to be\nhis own. Thus in the plenitude of her affection and in the serenity\nof her heart she had told everything to her cousin. And now also her\nfather knew it all. How this had come to pass she did not think to\ninquire. She suspected no harm from Patience. The thing had been so\nclear, that all the world might see it. Ralph, that false one, knew\nit also. Who could know it so well as he did? Had not those very\nwords been spoken by him,--been repeated by him? Now she was as one\nstricken, where wounds could not be hidden.\n\nOn that day Ralph was driven back to town in his cab, in a rather\ndisheartened condition, and no more was seen or heard of him for the\npresent at Popham Villa. His late guardian had behaved very ill to\nhim in telling Mary Bonner the story of Polly Neefit. That was his\nimpression,--feeling sure that Mary had alluded to the unfortunate\naffair with the breeches-maker's daughter, of which she could have\nheard tidings only from Sir Thomas. As to Clarissa, he had not\nexactly forgotten the little affair on the lawn; but to his eyes that\naffair had been so small as to be almost overlooked amidst larger\nmatters. Mary, he thought, had never looked so beautiful as she had\ndone while refusing him. He did not mean to give her up. Her heart,\nshe had told him, was not her own. He thought he had read of young\nladies in similar conditions, of young ladies who had bestowed their\nhearts and had afterwards got them back again for the sake of making\nsecond bestowals. He was not sure but that such an object would lend\na zest to life. There was his brother Gregory in love with Clarissa,\nand still true to her. He would be true to Mary, and would see\nwhether, in spite of that far-away lover, he might not be more\nsuccessful than his brother. At any rate he would not give her\nup,--and before he had gone to bed that night he had already\nconcocted a letter to her in his brain, explaining the whole of that\nNeefit affair, and asking her whether a man should be condemned to\nmisery for life because he had been led by misfortune into such a\nmistake as that. He dined very well at his club, and on the following\nmorning went down to the Moonbeam by an early train, for that day's\nhunting. Thence he returned to Newton Priory in time for Christmas,\nand as he was driven up to his own house, through his own park,\nmeeting one or two of his own tenants, and encountering now and then\nhis own obsequious labourers, he was not an unhappy man in spite of\nMary Bonner's cruel answer. It may be doubted whether his greatest\ntrouble at this moment did not arise from his dread of Neefit. He had\nmanaged to stay long enough in London to give orders that Neefit's\nmoney should be immediately paid. He knew that Neefit could not harm\nhim at law; but it would not be agreeable if the old man were to go\nabout the country telling everyone that he, Ralph Newton of Newton,\nhad twice offered to marry Polly. For the present we will leave him,\nalthough he is our hero, and will return to the girls at Popham\nVilla.\n\n\"It is all very well talking, Patience, but I don't mean to try to\nchange,\" Clarissa said. This was after that visit of the Percycross\ndeputation to Sir Thomas, and after Christmas. More than a week had\nnow passed by since Ralph had rushed down to Fulham with his offer,\nand the new year had commenced. Sir Thomas had been at home for\nChristmas,--for the one day,--and had then returned to London. He had\nseen his attorney respecting the petition, who was again to see Mr.\nGriffenbottom's London attorney and Mr. Trigger. In the meantime\nSir Thomas was to remain quiet for a few days. The petition was not\nto be tried till the end of February, and there was still time for\ndeliberation. Sir Thomas just now very often took out that great\nheap of Baconian papers, but still not a word of the biography was\nwritten. He was, alas! still very far from writing the first word.\n\"It is all very well, Patience, but I do not mean to try to change,\"\nsaid Clarissa.\n\nPoor Patience could make no answer, dreadful as was to her such an\nassertion from a young woman. \"There is a man who clearly does not\nwant to marry you, who has declared in the plainest way that he does\nwant to marry some one else, who has grossly deceived you, and who\nnever means to think of you again; and yet you say that you will\nwilfully adhere to your regard for him!\" Such would have been the\nspeech which Patience would have made, had she openly expressed her\nthoughts. But Clarissa was ill, and weak, and wretched; and Patience\ncould not bring herself to say a word that should distress her\nsister.\n\n\"If he came to me to-morrow, of course I should forgive him,\"\nClarissa said again. These conversations were never commenced by\nPatience, who would rather have omitted any mention of that base\nyoung man. \"Of course I should. Men do do those things. Men are not\nlike women. They do all manner of things and everybody forgives them.\nI don't say anything about hoping. I don't hope for anything. I am\nnot happy enough to hope. I shouldn't care if I knew I were going to\ndie to-morrow. But there can be no change. If you want me to be a\nhypocrite, Patience, I will; but what will be the use? The truth will\nbe the same.\"\n\nThe two girls let her have her way, never contradicted her, coaxed\nher, and tried to comfort her;--but it was in vain. At first she\nwould not go out of the house, not even to church, and then she took\nto lying in bed. This lasted into the middle of January, and still\nSir Thomas did not come home. He wrote frequently, short notes to\nPatience, sending money, making excuses, making promises, always\nexpressing some word of hatred or disgust as to Percycross; but still\nhe did not come. At last, when Clarissa declared that she preferred\nlying in bed to getting up, Patience went up to London and fetched\nher father home. It had gone so far with Sir Thomas now that he was\nunable even to attempt to defend himself. He humbly said that he was\nsorry that he had been away so long, and returned with Patience to\nthe villa.\n\n\"My dear,\" said Sir Thomas, seating himself by Clarissa's bedside,\n\"this is very bad.\"\n\n\"If I had known you were coming, papa, I would have got up.\"\n\n\"If you are not well, perhaps you are better here, dear.\"\n\n\"I don't think I am quite well, papa.\"\n\n\"What is it, my love?\" Clarissa looked at him out of her large\ntear-laden eyes, but said nothing. \"Patience says that you are not\nhappy.\"\n\n\"I don't know that anybody is happy, papa.\"\n\n\"I wish that you were with all my heart, my child. Can your father do\nanything that will make you happy?\"\n\n\"No, papa.\"\n\n\"Tell me, Clary. You do not mind my asking you questions?\"\n\n\"No, papa.\"\n\n\"Patience tells me that you are still thinking of Ralph Newton.\"\n\n\"Of course I think of him.\"\n\n\"I think of him too;--but there are different ways of thinking. We\nhave known him, all of us, a long time.\"\n\n\"Yes, papa.\"\n\n\"I wish with all my heart that we had never seen him. He is not\nworthy of our solicitude.\"\n\n\"You always liked him. I have heard you say you loved him dearly.\"\n\n\"I have said so, and I did love him. In a certain way I love him\nstill.\"\n\n\"So do I, papa.\"\n\n\"But I know him to be unworthy. Even if he had come here to offer you\nhis hand I doubt whether I could have permitted an engagement. Do you\nknow that within the last two months he has twice offered to marry\nanother young woman, and I doubt whether he is not at this moment\nengaged to her?\"\n\n\"Another?\" said poor Clarissa.\n\n\"Yes, and that without a pretence of affection on his part, simply\nbecause he wanted to get money from her father.\"\n\n\"Are you sure, papa?\" asked Clarissa, who was not prepared to\nbelieve, and did not believe this enormity on the part of the man she\nloved.\n\n\"I am quite sure. The father came to me to complain of him, and I had\nthe confession from Ralph's own lips, the very day that he came here\nwith his insulting offer to Mary Bonner.\"\n\n\"Did you tell Mary?\"\n\n\"No. I knew that it was unnecessary. There was no danger as to Mary.\nAnd who do you think this girl was? The daughter of a tailor, who had\nmade some money. It was not that he cared for her, Clary;--no more\nthan I do! Whether he meant to marry her or not I do not know.\"\n\n\"I'm sure he didn't, papa,\" said Clarissa, getting up in bed.\n\n\"And will that make it better? All that he wanted was the tradesman's\nmoney, and to get that he was willing either to deceive the girl, or\nto sell himself to her. I don't know which would have been the baser\nmode of traffic. Is that the conduct of a gentleman, Clary?\"\n\nPoor Clarissa was in terrible trouble. She hardly believed the story,\nwhich seemed to tell her of a degree of villany greater than ever her\nimagination had depicted to her;--and yet, if it were true, she would\nbe driven to look for means of excusing it. The story as told was\nindeed hardly just to Ralph, who in the course of his transactions\nwith Mr. Neefit had almost taught himself to believe that he could\nlove Polly very well; but it was not in this direction that Clarissa\nlooked for an apology for such conduct. \"They say that men do all\nmanner of things,\" she said, at last.\n\n\"I can only tell you this,\" said Sir Thomas very gravely, \"what men\nmay do I will not say, but no gentleman can ever have acted after\nthis fashion. He has shown himself to be a scoundrel.\"\n\n\"Papa, papa; don't say that!\" screamed Clarissa.\n\n\"My child, I can only tell you the truth. I know it is hard to bear.\nI would save you if I could; but it is better that you should know.\"\n\n\"Will he always be bad, papa?\"\n\n\"Who can say, my dear? God forbid that I should be too severe upon\nhim. But he has been so bad now that I am bound to tell you that you\nshould drive him from your thoughts. When he told me, all smiling,\nthat he had come down here to ask your cousin Mary to be his wife, I\nwas almost minded to spurn him from the door. He can have no feeling\nhimself of true attachment, and cannot know what it means in others.\nHe is heartless,--and unprincipled.\"\n\n\"Oh, papa, spare him. It is done now.\"\n\n\"And you will forget him, dearest?\"\n\n\"I will try, papa. But I think that I shall die. I would rather die.\nWhat is the good of living when nobody is to care for anybody, and\npeople are so bad as that?\"\n\n\"My Clarissa must not say that nobody cares for her. Has any person\never been false to you but he? Is not your sister true to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, papa.\"\n\n\"And Mary?\"\n\n\"Yes, papa.\" He was afraid to ask her whether he also had not been\ntrue to her? Even in that moment there arose in his mind a doubt,\nwhether all this evil might not have been avoided, had he contented\nhimself to live beneath the same roof with his children. He said\nnothing of himself, but she supplied the want. \"I know you love me,\npapa, and have always been good to me. I did not mean that. But I\nnever cared for any one but him,--in that way.\"\n\nSir Thomas, in dealing with the character of his late ward, had been\nsomewhat too severe. It is difficult, perhaps, to say what amount of\nmisconduct does constitute a scoundrel, or justifies the critic in\nsaying that this or that man is not a gentleman. There be those who\naffirm that he who owes a debt for goods which he cannot pay is no\ngentleman, and tradesmen when they cannot get their money are no\ndoubt sometimes inclined to hold that opinion. But the opinion is\nchanged when the money comes at last,--especially if it comes with\ninterest. Ralph had never owed a shilling which he did not intend to\npay, and had not property to cover. That borrowing of money from Mr.\nNeefit was doubtless bad. No one would like to know that his son had\nborrowed money from his tailor. But it is the borrowing of the money\nthat is bad, rather than the special dealing with the tradesman. And\nas to that affair with Polly, some excuse may be made. He had meant\nto be honest to Neefit, and he had meant to be true to Neefit's\ndaughter. Even Sir Thomas, high-minded as he was, would hardly have\npassed so severe a sentence, had not the great sufferer in the matter\nbeen his own daughter.\n\nBut the words that he spoke were doubtless salutary to poor Clarissa.\nShe never again said to Patience that she would not try to make a\nchange, nor did she ever again declare that if Ralph came back again\nshe would forgive him. On the day after the scene with her father\nshe was up again, and she made an effort to employ herself about the\nhouse. On the next Sunday she went to church, and then they all knew\nthat she was making the necessary struggle. Ralph's name was never\nmentioned, nor for a time was any allusion made to the family of the\nNewtons. \"The worst of it, I think, is over,\" said Patience one day\nto Mary.\n\n\"The worst of it is over,\" said Mary; \"but it is not all over. It is\nhard to forget when one has loved.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII.\n\nNOT BROKEN-HEARTED.\n\n\nChristmas had come and gone at Newton Priory, and the late Squire's\nson had left the place,--protesting as he did so that he left it\nfor ever. To him also life in that particular spot of earth was\nimpossible, unless he could live there as the lord and master of\nall. Everybody throughout that and neighbouring parishes treated him\nnot only with kindness, but with the warmest affection. The gentry,\nthe farmers, and the labourers, all men who had known him in the\nhunting-field, in markets, on the bench, or at church, men, women and\nchildren, joined together in forming plans by means of which he could\nremain at Newton. The young Squire asked him to make the house his\nhome, at any rate for the hunting season. The parson offered half the\nparsonage. His friend Morris, who was a bachelor, suggested a joint\nhome and joint stables between them. But it was all of no avail. Had\nit not been for the success which had so nearly crowned the late\nSquire's efforts during the last six months, it might have been that\nhis friends would have prevailed with him. But he had been too near\nbeing the master to be able to live at Newton in any other capacity.\nThe tenants had been told that they were to be his tenants. The\nservants had been told that they were to be his servants. During a\nfew short weeks, he had almost been master, so absolute had been the\ndetermination of the old Squire to show to all around him that his\nson, in spite of the blot upon the young man's birth, was now the\nheir in all things, and possessed of every privilege which would\nattach itself to an elder son. He himself while his father lived had\ntaken these things calmly, had shown no elation, had even striven to\nmoderate the vehemence of his father's efforts on his behalf;--but\nnot the less had he been conscious of the value of what was being\ndone for him. To be the promised future owner of the acres on which\nhe had lived, of the coverts through which he had ridden, of every\ntree and bank which he had known from his boyhood, had been to him\na source of gratified pride not the less strong because he had\nconcealed it. The disappointment did hit him sorely. His dreams\nhad been of Parliament, of power in the county, of pride of place,\nand popularity. He now found that they were to be no more than\ndreams;--but with this additional sorrow, that all around him knew\nthat they had been dreamed. No;--he could not stay at Newton even\nfor the sake of living with friends who loved him so dearly. He said\nlittle or nothing of this to any one. Not even to Gregory Newton or\nto his friend Morris did he tell much of his feeling. He was not\nproud of his dreamings, and it seemed to himself that his punishment\nwas just. Nor could he speak to either of them or to any man of his\npast ambition, or of what hopes might remain to him in reference to\nMary Bonner. The young Squire had gone forth with the express purpose\nof wooing her, had declared his purpose of doing so, and had returned\nto Newton at any rate without any ready tale of triumph on his\ntongue. What had been his fortune the rival would not ask; and while\nthe two remained together at the priory no further word was spoken\nof Mary Bonner. He, Ralph the dispossessed one, while he believed\nhimself to be the heir, had intended to bring her home as a fitting\nqueen to share his throne. It might be that she would consent to be\nhis without a throne to share; but in thinking of her he could not\nbut remember what his ambition had been, and he could hardly bring\nhimself now to offer to her that which was comparatively so little\nworth the having. To suppose that she should already \"be fond of\nhim,\" should already long for him as he longed for her, was contrary\nto his nature. Hitherto when he had been in her presence, he had\nstood there as a man whose position in life was almost contemptible;\nand though it would be unjust to him to say that he had hoped to\nwin her by his acres, still he had felt that his father's success\non his behalf might justify him in that which would otherwise be\nunjustifiable. For the present, however, he could take no steps in\nthat direction. He could only suggest to himself what had already\nbeen her answer, or what at some future time might be the answer\nshe would make to his rival. He had lost a father between whom and\nhimself there had existed ties, not only of tender love, but of\nperfect friendship, and for awhile he must bewail his loss. That\nhe could not bewail his lost father without thinking of his lost\nproperty, and of the bride that had never been won, was an agony to\nhis soul.\n\nHe had found a farm down in Norfolk, near to Swaffham, which he could\ntake for twelve months, with the option of purchase at the expiration\nof that time, and thither he betook himself. There were about four\nhundred acres, and the place was within his means. He did not think\nit likely that Mary Bonner would choose to come and live upon a\nNorfolk farm; and yet what other work in life was there for which\nhe was fit? Early in January he went down to Beamingham Hall, as\nthe place was called, and there we will leave him for the present,\nconsoling himself with oil-cake, and endeavouring to take a pride in\na long row of stall-fed cattle.\n\nAt this time the two brothers were living at Newton Priory. Ralph the\nheir had bought some of his uncle's horses, and had commenced hunting\nwith the hounds around him; though he had not as yet withdrawn his\nstud from the Moonbeam. He was not altogether at his ease, as he\nhad before the end of February received three or four letters from\nNeefit, all of them dictated by Waddle, in which his conduct was\npainted not in the most flattering colours. Neefit's money had\nbeen repaid, but Neefit would not understand that the young heir's\nobligations to him had by any means been acquitted by that very\nordinary process. He had risked his money when payment was very\ndoubtful, and now he intended to have something beyond cash in return\nfor all that he had done. \"There are debts of honour which a real\ngentleman feels himself more bound to pay than any bills,\" Waddle had\nwritten. And to such dogmatic teachings as these Neefit would always\nadd something out of his own head. \"There ain't nobody who shan't\nknow all about it, unless you're on the square again.\" Ralph had\nwritten one reply since he had been at Newton, in which he explained\nat some length that it was impossible that he should renew his\naddresses to a young lady who had twice rejected them, and who had\nassured him that she did not love him. He professed the greatest\nrespect for Miss Neefit, a respect which had, if possible, been\nheightened by her behaviour in this matter,--but it must now be\nunderstood that the whole affair was at an end. Neefit would not\nunderstand this, but Neefit's further letters, which had not been\nunfrequent, were left unanswered. Ralph had now told the whole\nstory to his brother, and had written his one reply from Newton in\nconformity with his brother's advice. After that they both thought\nthat no further rejoinder could be of any service.\n\nThe parsonage was for the time deserted, Gregory having for the\npresent consented to share his brother's house. In spite of that\nlittle thorn in the flesh which Neefit was, Ralph was able to enjoy\nhis life very thoroughly. He went on with all the improvements about\nthe place which the Squire had commenced, and was active in making\nacquaintance with every one who lived upon his land. He was not\nwithout good instincts, and understood thoroughly that respectability\nhad many more attractions than a character for evil living. He was,\ntoo, easily amenable to influence from those around him; and under\nGregory's auspices, was constant at his parish church. He told\nhimself at once that he had many duties to perform, and he attempted\nto perform them. He did not ask Lieutenant Cox or Captain Fooks to\nthe Priory, and quite prepared himself for the character of Henry\nV. in miniature, as he walked about his park, and rode about his\nfarms, and talked with the wealthier farmers on hunting mornings. He\nhad a full conception of his own dignity, and some not altogether\ninaccurate idea of the manner in which it would become him to sustain\nit. He was, perhaps, a little too self-conscious, and over-inclined\nto suppose that people were regarding his conduct because he was\nNewton of Newton;--Newton of Newton with no blot on his shield, by\nright of his birth, and subject to no man's reproach.\n\nHe had failed grievously in one matter on which he had set his heart;\nbut as to that he was, as the reader knows, resolved to try again. He\nhad declared his passion to the other Ralph, but his rival had not\nmade the confidence mutual. But hitherto he had said nothing on the\nsubject to his brother. He had put it by, as it were, out of his mind\nfor awhile, resolving that it should not trouble him immediately, in\nthe middle of his new joys. It was a thing that would keep,--a thing,\nat any rate, that need not overshadow him night and morning. When\nNeefit continued to disturb him with threats of publicity in regard\nto Polly's wrongs, he did tell himself that in no way could he so\neffectually quiet Mr. Neefit as by marrying somebody else, and that\nhe would, at some very early date, have recourse to this measure;\nbut, in the meantime, he would enjoy himself without letting his\nunrequited passion lie too heavily as a burden on his heart. So\nhe eat and drank, and rode and prayed, and sat with his brother\nmagistrates on the bench, and never ceased to think of his good\nfortune, in that he had escaped from the troubles of his youth,\nunscathed and undegraded.\n\nThen there came a further letter from Mr. Neefit, from which there\narose some increase of confidence among the brothers. There was\nnothing special in this letter. These letters, indeed, were very\nlike to each other, and, as had now come to be observed, were always\nreceived on a Tuesday morning. It was manifest to them that Neefit\nspent the leisure hours of his Sundays in meditating upon the\nhardness of his position; and that, as every Monday morning came,\nhe caused a new letter to be written. On this particular Tuesday,\nRalph had left home before the post had come, and did not get the\nbreeches-maker's epistle till his return from hunting. He chucked\nit across the table to Gregory when he came down to dinner, and the\nparson read it. There was no new attack in it; and as the servant was\nin the room, nothing was then said about it. But after dinner the\nsubject was discussed.\n\n\"I wish I knew how to stop the fellow's mouth,\" said the elder\nbrother.\n\n\"I think I should get Carey to see him,\" suggested Gregory. \"He would\nunderstand a lawyer when he was told that nothing could come of it\nbut trouble to himself and his daughter.\"\n\n\"She has no hand in it, you know.\"\n\n\"But it must injure her.\"\n\n\"One would think so. But she is a girl whom nothing can injure. You\ncan't imagine how good and how great she is;--great in her way, that\nis. She is as steady as a rock; and nobody who knows her will ever\nimagine her to be a party to her father's folly. She may pick and\nchoose a husband any day she pleases. And the men about her won't\nmind this kind of thing as we should. No doubt all their friends joke\nhim about it, but no one will think of blaming Polly.\"\n\n\"It can't do her any good,\" said Gregory.\n\n\"It cannot do her any harm. She has a strength of her own that even\nher father can't lessen.\"\n\n\"All the same, I wish there were an end of it.\"\n\n\"So do I, for my own sake,\" said Ralph. As he spoke he filled his\nglass, and passed the bottle, and then was silent for a few moments.\n\"Neefit did help me,\" he continued, \"and I don't want to speak\nagainst him; but he is the most pig-headed old fool that ever\nexisted. Nothing will stop him but Polly's marriage, or mine.\"\n\n\"I suppose you will marry soon now. You ought to be married,\" said\nGregory, in a melancholy tone, in which was told something of the\ndisappointment of his own passion.\n\n\"Well;--yes. I believe I might as well tell you a little secret,\nGreg.\"\n\n\"I suppose I can guess it,\" said Gregory, with still a deeper sound\nof woe.\n\n\"I don't think you can. It is quite possible you may, however. You\nknow Mary Bonner;--don't you?\"\n\nThe cloud upon the parson's brow was at once lightened. \"No,\" said\nhe. \"I have heard of her, of course.\"\n\n\"You have never seen Mary Bonner?\"\n\n\"I have not been up in town since she came. What should take me up?\nAnd if I were there, I doubt whether I should go out to Fulham. What\nis the use of going?\" But still, though he spoke thus, there was\nsomething less of melancholy in his voice than when he had first\nspoken. Ralph did not immediately go on with his story, and his\nbrother now asked a question. \"But what of Mary Bonner? Is she to be\nthe future mistress of the Priory?\"\n\n\"God only knows.\"\n\n\"But you mean to ask her?\"\n\n\"I have asked her.\"\n\n\"And you are engaged?\"\n\n\"By no means. I wish I were. You haven't seen her, but I suppose you\nhave heard of her?\"\n\n\"Ralph spoke of her,--and told me that she was very lovely.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, I don't think that even in a picture I ever saw\nanything approaching to her beauty. You've seen that thing at\nDresden. She is more like that than anything I know. She seems almost\ntoo grand for a fellow to speak to, and yet she looks as if she\ndidn't know it. I don't think she does know it.\" Gregory said not a\nword, but looked at his brother, listening. \"But, by George there's\na dignity about her, a sort of self-possession, a kind of noli me\ntangere, you understand, which makes a man almost afraid to come near\nher. She hasn't sixpence in the world.\"\n\n\"That needn't signify to you now.\"\n\n\"Not in the least. I only just mention it to explain. And her father\nwas nobody in particular,--some old general who used to wear a cocked\nhat and keep the niggers down out in one of the colonies. She herself\ntalked of coming home here to be a governess;--by Jove! yes, a\ngoverness. Well, to look at her, you'd think she was born a countess\nin her own right.\"\n\n\"Is she so proud?\"\n\n\"No;--it's not that. I don't know what it is. It's the way her head\nis put on. Upon my word, to see her turn her neck is the grandest\nthing in the world. I never saw anything like it. I don't know that\nshe's proud by nature,--though she has got a dash of that too. Don't\nyou know there are some horses show their breeding at a glance? I\ndon't suppose they feel it themselves; but there it is on them, like\nthe Hall-mark on silver. I don't know whether you can understand a\nman being proud of his wife.\"\n\n\"Indeed I can.\"\n\n\"I don't mean of her personal qualities, but of the outside get up.\nSome men are proud of their wives' clothes, or their jewels, or their\nfalse hair. With Mary nothing of that sort could have any effect; but\nto see her step, or move her head, or lift her arm, is enough to make\na man feel,--feel,--feel that she beats every other woman in the\nworld by chalks.\"\n\n\"And she is to be mistress here?\"\n\n\"Indeed she should,--to-morrow, if she'd come.\"\n\n\"You did ask her?\"\n\n\"Yes,--I asked her.\"\n\n\"And what did she say?\"\n\n\"Nothing that I cared to hear. She had just been told all this\naccursed story about Polly Neefit. I'll never forgive Sir\nThomas,--never.\" The reader will be pleased to remember that\nSir Thomas did not mention Miss Neefit's name, or any of the\ncircumstances of the Neefit contract, to his niece.\n\n\"He could hardly have wished to set her against you.\"\n\n\"I don't know; but he must have told her. She threw it in my teeth\nthat I ought to marry Polly.\"\n\n\"Then she did not accept you?\"\n\n\"By George! no;--anything but that. She is one of those women who,\nas I fancy, never take a man at the first offer. It isn't that they\nmean to shilly and shally and make a fuss, but there's a sort of\nmajesty about them which instinctively declines to yield itself.\nUnconsciously they feel something like offence at the suggestion that\na man should think enough of himself to ask for such a possession.\nThey come to it, after a time.\"\n\n\"And she will come to it, after a time?\"\n\n\"I didn't mean to say that. I don't intend, however, to give it up.\"\nRalph paused in his story, considering whether he would tell his\nbrother what Mary had confessed to him as to her affection for some\none else, but he resolved, at last, that he would say nothing of\nthat. He had himself put less of confidence in that assertion than he\ndid in her rebuke with reference to the other young woman to whom she\nchose to consider that he owed himself. It was his nature to think\nrather of what absolutely concerned himself, than of what related\nsimply to her. \"I shan't give her up. That's all I can say,\" he\ncontinued. \"I'm not the sort of fellow to give things up readily.\" It\ndid occur to Gregory at that moment that his brother had not shown\nmuch self-confidence on that question of giving up the property. \"I'm\npretty constant when I've set my mind on a thing. I'm not going to\nlet any woman break my heart for me, but I shall stick to it.\"\n\nHe was not going to let any woman break his heart for him! Gregory,\nas he heard this, knew that his brother regarded him as a man whose\nheart was broken, and he could not help asking himself whether or\nnot it was good for a man that he should be able to suffer as he\nsuffered, because a woman was fair and yet not fair for him. That his\nown heart was broken,--broken after the fashion of which his brother\nwas speaking,--he was driven to confess to himself. It was not that\nhe should die, or that his existence would be one long continued hour\nof misery to him. He could eat and drink, and do his duty and enjoy\nhis life. And yet his heart was broken. He could not piece it so that\nit should be fit for any other woman. He could not teach himself not\nto long for that one woman who would not love him. The romance of his\nlife had formed itself there, and there it must remain. In all his\nsolitary walks it was of her that he still thought. Of all the bright\ncastles in the air which he still continued to build, she was ever\nthe mistress. And yet he knew that she would never make him happy.\nHe had absolutely resolved that he would not torment her by another\nrequest. But he gave himself no praise for his constancy, looking\non himself as being somewhat weak in that he could not overcome his\nlonging. When Ralph declared that he would not break his heart, but\nthat, nevertheless, he would stick to the girl, Gregory envied him,\nnot doubting of his success, and believing that it was to men of this\ncalibre that success in love is generally given. \"I hope with all my\nheart that you may win her,\" he said.\n\n\"I must run my chance like another. There's no 'Veni, vidi, vici,'\nabout it, I can tell you; nor is it likely that there should be with\nsuch a girl as Mary Bonner. Fill your glass, old fellow. We needn't\nsit mumchance because we're thinking of our loves.\"\n\n\"I had thought,--\" began Gregory very slowly.\n\n\"What did you think?\"\n\n\"I had thought once that you were thinking of--Clarissa.\"\n\n\"What put that into your head?\"\n\n\"If you had I should never have said a word, nor fancied any wrong.\nOf course she'll marry some one. And I don't know why I should ever\nwish that it should not be you.\"\n\n\"But what made you think of it?\"\n\n\"Well; I did. It was just a word that Patience said in one of her\nletters.\"\n\n\"What sort of word?\" asked Ralph, with much interest.\n\n\"It was nothing, you know. I just misunderstood her. When one is\nalways thinking of a thing everything turns itself that way. I got it\ninto my head that she meant to hint to me that as you and Clary were\nfond of each other, I ought to forget it all. I made up my mind that\nI would;--but it is so much easier to make up one's mind than to do\nit.\" There came a tear in each eye as he spoke, and he turned his\nface towards the fire that his brother might not see them. And there\nthey remained hot and oppressive, because he would not raise his hand\nto rub them away.\n\n\"I wonder what it was she said,\" asked Ralph.\n\n\"Oh, nothing. Don't you know how a fellow has fancies?\"\n\n\"There wasn't anything in it,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"Oh;--of course not.\"\n\n\"Patience might have imagined it,\" said Ralph. \"That's just like such\na sister as Patience.\"\n\n\"She's the best woman that ever lived,\" said Gregory.\n\n\"As good as gold,\" said Ralph. \"I don't think, however, I shall very\nsoon forgive Sir Thomas.\"\n\n\"I don't mind saying now that I am glad it is so,\" said Gregory;\n\"though as regards Clary that seems to be cruel. But I don't think I\ncould have come much here had she become your wife.\"\n\n\"Nothing shall ever separate us, Greg.\"\n\n\"I hope not;--but I don't know whether I could have done it. I almost\nthink that I oughtn't to live where I should see her; and I did fear\nit at one time.\"\n\n\"She'll come to the parsonage yet, old fellow, if you'll stick to\nher,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"Never,\" said Gregory. Then that conversation was over.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII.\n\nONCE MORE.\n\n\nAt the end of February Ralph declared his purpose of returning to the\nMoonbeam, for the rest of the hunting season. \"I'm not going to be\nsuch an ass,\" he said to his brother, \"as to keep two sets of horses\ngoing. I bought my uncle's because it seemed to suit just at the\ntime; and there are the others at Horsball's, because I've not had\ntime to settle down yet. I'll go over for March, and take a couple\nwith me; and, at the end of it, I'll get rid of those I don't like.\nThen that'll be the end of the Moonbeam, as far as I am concerned.\"\nSo he prepared to start, and on the evening before he went his\nbrother declared that he would go as far as London with him. \"That's\nall right,\" said Ralph, \"but what's taking you up now?\" The parson\nsaid that he wanted to get a few things, and to have his hair cut. He\nshouldn't stay above one night. Ralph asked no more questions, and\nthe two brothers went up to London together.\n\nWe fear that Patience Underwood may not have been in all respects a\ndiscreet preserver of her sister's secrets. But then there is nothing\nmore difficult of attainment than discretion in the preservation\nof such mysteries. To keep a friend's secret well the keeper of it\nshould be firmly resolved to act upon it in no way,--not even for the\nadvantage of the owner of it. If it be confided to you as a secret\nthat your friend is about to make his maiden speech in the House, you\nshould not even invite your acquaintances to be in their places,--not\nif secrecy be the first object. In all things the knowledge should be\nto you as though you had it not. Great love is hardly capable of such\nsecrecy as this. In the fulness of her love Patience had allowed her\nfather to learn the secret of poor Clary's heart; and in the fulness\nof her love she had endeavoured to make things smooth at Newton.\nShe had not told the young clergyman that Clarissa had given to his\nbrother that which she could not give to him; but, meaning to do a\nmorsel of service to both of them, if that might be possible, she had\nsaid a word or two, with what effect the reader will have seen from\nthe conversation given in the last chapter.\n\n\"She'll come to the parsonage yet,\" Ralph had said; and Gregory in\none word had implied his assured conviction that any such coming was\na thing not to be hoped for,--an event not even to be regarded as\npossible. Nevertheless, he made up his mind that he would go up to\nLondon,--to have his hair cut. In so making up his mind he did not\nfor a moment believe that it could be of any use to him. He was not\nquite sure that when in London he would go to Popham Villa. He was\nquite sure that if he did go to Popham Villa he would make no further\noffer to Clarissa. He knew that his journey was foolish, simply\nthe result of an uneasy, restless spirit,--that it would be better\nfor him to remain in his parish and move about among the old women\nand bed-ridden men; but still he went. He would dine at his club,\nhe said, and perhaps he might go down to Fulham on the following\nmorning. And so the brothers parted. Ralph, as a man of property,\nwith many weighty matters on hand, had, of course, much to do.\nHe desired to inspect some agricultural implements, and a new\ncarriage,--he had ever so many things to say to Carey, the lawyer,\nand wanted to order new harnesses for the horses. So he went to his\nclub, and played whist all the afternoon.\n\nGregory, as soon as he had secured a bed at a quiet inn, walked off\nto Southampton Buildings. From the direct manner in which this was\ndone, it might have been argued that he had come up to London with\nthe purpose of seeing Sir Thomas; but it was not so. He turned his\nsteps towards the place where Clary's father was generally to be\nfound, because he knew not what else to do. As he went he told\nhimself that he might as well leave it alone;--but still he went.\nStemm at once told him, with a candour that was almost marvellous,\nthat Sir Thomas was out of town. The hearing of the petition was\ngoing on at Percycross, and Sir Thomas was there, as a matter of\ncourse. Stemm seemed to think it rather odd that an educated man,\nsuch as was the Rev. Gregory Newton, should have been unaware that\nthe petition against the late election at Percycross was being\ncarried on at this moment. \"We've got Serjeant Burnaby, and little\nMr. Joram down, to make a fight of it,\" said Mr. Stemm; \"but, as\nfar as I can learn, they might just as well have remained up in town.\nIt's only sending good money after bad.\" The young parson hardly\nexpressed that interest in the matter which Stemm had expected, but\nturned away, thinking whether he had not better have his hair cut at\nonce, and then go home.\n\nBut he did go to Popham Villa on the same afternoon, and,--such was\nhis fortune,--he found Clarissa alone. Since her father had seen her\nin bed, and spoken to her of what he had called the folly of her\nlove, she had not again given herself up to the life of a sick-room.\nShe dressed herself and came down to breakfast of a morning, and then\nwould sit with a needle in her hand till she took her book, and then\nwith a book till she took her needle. She tried to work, and tried to\nread, and perhaps she did accomplish a little of each. And then, when\nPatience would tell her that exercise was necessary, she would put\non her hat and creep out among the paths. She did make some kind of\neffort to get over the evil that had come upon her; but still no\none could watch her and not know that she was a wounded deer. \"Miss\nClarissa is at home,\" said the servant, who well knew that the young\nclergyman was one of the rejected suitors. There had been hardly a\nsecret in the house in reference to Gregory Newton's love. The two\nother young ladies, the girl said, had gone to London, but would be\nhome to dinner. Then, with a beating heart, Gregory was ushered into\nthe drawing-room. Clarissa was sitting near the window, with a novel\nin her lap, having placed herself there with the view of getting what\nwas left of the light of the early spring evening; but she had not\nread a word for the last quarter of an hour. She was thinking of\nthat word scoundrel, with which her father had spoken of the man she\nloved. Could it be that he was in truth so bad as that? And, if it\nwere true, would she not take him, scoundrel as he was, if he would\ncome to her? He might be a--scoundrel in that one thing, on that one\noccasion, and yet be good to her. He might repent his scoundrelism,\nand she certainly would forgive it. Of one thing she was quite\nsure;--he had not looked like a scoundrel when he had given her that\nassurance on the lawn! And so she thought of young men in general.\nIt was very easy to call a young man a scoundrel, and yet to forgive\nhim all his iniquities when it suited to do so. Young men might get\nin debt, and gamble, and make love wherever they pleased, and all at\nonce,--and yet be forgiven. All these things were very bad. It might\nbe just to call a man a scoundrel because he could not pay his debts,\nor because he made bets about horses. Young men did a great many\nthings which would be horrid indeed were a girl to do them. Then one\npapa would call such a man a scoundrel, because he was not wanted\nto come to the house; while another papa would make him welcome,\nand give him the best of everything. Ralph Newton might be a\nscoundrel; but if so,--as Clarissa thought,--there were a great\nmany good-looking scoundrels about in the world, as to whom their\nscoundrelism did very little to injure them in the esteem of all\ntheir friends. It was thus that Clarissa was thinking over her own\naffairs when Gregory Newton was shown into the room.\n\nThe greeting on both sides was at first formal and almost cold. Clary\nhad given a little start of surprise, and had then subsided into a\nmost demure mode of answering questions. Yes; papa was at Percycross.\nShe did not know when he was expected back. Mary and Patience were in\nLondon. Yes;--she was at home all alone. No; she had not seen Ralph\nsince his uncle's death. The question which elicited this answer had\nbeen asked without any design, and Clary endeavoured to make her\nreply without emotion. If she displayed any, Gregory, who had his own\naffairs upon his mind, did not see it. No;--they had not seen the\nother Mr. Newton as he passed through town. They had all understood\nthat he had been very much disturbed by his father's horrible\naccident and death. Then Gregory paused in his questions, and\nClarissa expressed a hope that there might be no more hunting in the\nworld.\n\nIt was very hard work, this conversation, and Gregory was beginning\nto think that he had done no good by coming, when on a sudden he\nstruck a chord from whence came a sound of music. \"Ralph and I have\nbeen living together at the Priory,\" he said.\n\n\"Oh;--indeed; yes;--I think I heard Patience say that you were at the\nPriory.\"\n\n\"I suppose I shall not be telling any secret to you in talking about\nhim and your cousin Mary?\"\n\nClarissa felt that she was blushing up to her brow, but she made a\ngreat effort to compose herself. \"Oh, no,\" she said, \"we all know of\nit.\"\n\n\"I hope he may be successful,\" said Gregory.\n\n\"I do not know. I cannot tell.\"\n\n\"I never knew a man more thoroughly in love than he is.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it,\" said Clarissa.\n\n\"Not believe it! Indeed you may, Clary. I have never seen her, but\nfrom what he says of her I suppose her to be most beautiful.\"\n\n\"She is,--very beautiful.\" This was said with a strong emphasis.\n\n\"And why should you not believe it?\"\n\n\"It will not be of the slightest use, Mr. Newton; and you may tell\nhim so. Though I suppose it is impossible to make a man believe\nthat.\"\n\n\"Are we both so unfortunate?\" he asked.\n\nThe poor girl with her wounded love, and every feeling sore within\nher, had not intended to say anything that should be cruel or\ninjurious to Gregory himself, and it was not till the words were\nout of her mouth that she herself perceived their effect. \"Oh, Mr.\nNewton, I was only thinking of him,\" she said, innocently. \"I only\nmeant that Ralph is one of those who always think they are to have\neverything they want.\"\n\n\"I am not one of those, Clarissa. And yet I am one who seem never to\nbe tired of asking for that which is not to be given to me. I said to\nmyself when last I went from here that I would never ask again;--that\nI would never trouble you any more.\" She was sitting with the book in\nher hand, looking out into the gloom, and now she made no attempt to\nanswer him. \"And yet you see here I am,\" he continued. She was still\nsilent, and her head was still turned away from him; but he could see\nthat tears were streaming down her cheeks. \"I have not the power not\nto come to you while yet there is a chance,\" he said. \"I can live and\nwork without you, but I can have no life of my own. When I first saw\nyou I made a picture to myself of what my life might be, and I cannot\nget that moved from before my eyes. I am sorry, however, that my\ncoming should make you weep.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mr. Newton, I am so wretched!\" she said, turning round sharply\nupon him. For a moment she had thought that she would tell him\neverything, and then she checked herself, and remembered how\nill-placed such a confidence would be.\n\n\"What should make you wretched, dearest?\"\n\n\"I do not know. I cannot tell. I sometimes think the world is bad\naltogether, and that I had better die. People are so cruel and so\nhard, and things are so wrong. But you may tell your brother that\nhe need not think of my cousin, Mary. Nothing ever would move her.\nH--sh--. Here they are. Do not say that I was crying.\"\n\nHe was introduced to the beauty, and as the lights came, Clarissa\nescaped. Yes;--she was indeed most lovely; but as he looked on her,\nGregory felt that he agreed with Clarissa that nothing on earth would\nmove her. He remained there for another half-hour; but Clarissa did\nnot return, and then he went back to London.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV.\n\nTHE PETITION.\n\n\nThe time for hearing the petition at Percycross had at length come,\nand the judge had gone down to that ancient borough. The day fixed\nwas Monday, the 27th, and Parliament had then been sitting for three\nweeks. Mr. Griffenbottom had been as constant in his place as though\nthere had been no sword hanging over his head; but Sir Thomas had not\nas yet even taken the oaths. He had made up his mind that he would\nnot even enter the house while this bar against him as a legislator\nexisted, and he had not as yet even been seen in the lobby. His\ndaughters, his colleague, Mr. Trigger, and Stemm had all expostulated\nwith him on the subject, assuring him that he should treat the\npetition with the greatest contempt, at any rate till it should have\nproved itself by its success to be a matter not contemptible; but to\nthese counsellors he gave no ear, and when he went down to give his\nevidence before the judge at Percycross his seat had as yet availed\nhim nothing.\n\nMr. Griffenbottom had declared that he would not pay a shilling\ntowards the expense of the petition, maintaining that his own seat\nwas safe, and that any peril incurred had been so incurred simply\non behalf of Sir Thomas. Nothing, according to Mr. Griffenbottom's\nviews, could be more unjust than to expect that he should take any\npart in the matter. Trigger, too, had endeavoured to impress this\nupon Sir Thomas more than once or twice. But this had been all in\nvain; and Sir Thomas, acting under the advice of his own attorney,\nhad at last compelled Mr. Griffenbottom to take his share in the\nmatter. Mr. Griffenbottom did not scruple to say that he was very\nill-used, and to hint that any unfair practices which might possibly\nhave prevailed during the last election at Percycross, had all been\nadopted on behalf of Sir Thomas, and in conformity with Sir Thomas's\nviews. It will, therefore, be understood that the two members did\nnot go down to the borough in the best humour with each other. Mr.\nTrigger still nominally acted for both; but it had been almost avowed\nthat Sir Thomas was to be treated as a Jonah, if by such treatment\nany salvation might be had for the ship of which Griffenbottom was to\nbe regarded as the captain.\n\nMr. Westmacott was also in Percycross,--and so was Moggs, reinstated\nin his old room at the Cordwainers' Arms. Moggs had not been\nsummoned, nor was his presence there required for any purpose\nimmediately connected with the inquiry to be made; but Purity and the\nRights of Labour may always be advocated; and when better than at a\nmoment in which the impurity of a borough is about to be made the\nsubject of public condemnation? And Moggs, moreover, had now rankling\nin his bosom a second cause of enmity against the Tories of the\nborough. Since the election he had learned that his rival, Ralph\nNewton, was in some way connected with the sitting member, Sir\nThomas, and he laid upon Sir Thomas's back the weight of his full\ndispleasure in reference to the proposed marriage with Polly Neefit.\nHe had heard that Polly had raised some difficulty,--had, indeed,\nrejected her aristocratic suitor, and was therefore not without hope;\nbut he had been positively assured by Neefit himself that the match\nwould be made, and was consequently armed with a double purpose in\nhis desire to drive Sir Thomas ignominiously out of Percycross.\n\nSir Thomas had had more than one interview with Serjeant Burnaby\nand little Mr. Joram, than whom two more astute barristers in such\nmatters were not to be found at that time practising,--though perhaps\nat that time the astuteness of the Serjeant was on the wane; while\nthat of Jacky Joram, as he was familiarly called, was daily rising\nin repute. Sir Thomas himself, barrister and senior to these two\ngentlemen, had endeavoured to hold his own with them, and to impress\non them the conviction that he had nothing to conceal; that he had\npersonally endeavoured, as best he knew how, to avoid corruption,\nand that if there had been corruption on the part of his own agents,\nhe was himself ready to be a party in proclaiming it. But he found\nhimself to be absolutely ignored and put out of court by his own\ncounsel. They were gentlemen with whom professionally he had had no\nintercourse, as he had practised at the Chancery, and they at the\nCommon Law Bar. But he had been Solicitor-General, and was a bencher\nof his Inn, whereas Serjeant Burnaby was only a Serjeant, and Jacky\nJoram still wore a stuff gown. Nevertheless, he found himself to be\n\"nowhere\" in discussing with them the circumstances of the election.\nEven Joram, whom he seemed to remember having seen only the other day\nas an ugly shame-faced boy about the courts, treated him, not exactly\nwith indignity, but with patronising good-nature, listening with\nan air of half-attention to what he said, and then not taking the\nslightest heed of a word of it. Who does not know this transparent\npretence of courtesies, which of all discourtesies is the most\noffensive? \"Ah, just so, Sir Thomas; just so. And now, Mr. Trigger,\nI suppose Mr. Puffer's account hasn't yet been settled.\" Any word\nfrom Mr. Trigger was of infinitely greater value with Mr. Joram than\nall Sir Thomas's protestations. Sir Thomas could not keep himself\nfrom remembering that Jacky Joram's father was a cheesemonger at\nGloucester, who had married the widow of a Jew with a little money.\nTwenty times Sir Thomas made up his mind to retire from the business\naltogether; but he always found himself unable to do so. When he\nmentioned the idea, Griffenbottom flung up his hands in dismay at\nsuch treachery on the part of an ally,--such treachery and such\ncowardice! What!--had not he, Sir Thomas, forced him, Griffenbottom,\ninto all this ruinous expenditure? And now to talk of throwing up the\nsponge! It was in vain that Sir Thomas explained that he had forced\nnobody into it. It was manifestly the case that he had refused to go\non with it by himself, and on this Mr. Griffenbottom and Mr. Trigger\ninsisted so often and with so much strength that Sir Thomas felt\nhimself compelled to stand to his guns, bad as he believed those guns\nto be.\n\nIf Sir Thomas meant to retreat, why had he not retreated when a\nproposition to that effect was made to him at his own chambers? Of\nall the weak, vacillating, ill-conditioned men that Mr. Griffenbottom\nhad ever been concerned with, Sir Thomas Underwood was the weakest,\nmost vacillating, and most ill-conditioned. To have to sit in the\nsame boat with such a man was the greatest misfortune that had ever\nbefallen Mr. Griffenbottom in public life. Mr. Griffenbottom did not\nexactly say these hard things in the hearing of Sir Thomas, but he\nso said them that they became the common property of the Jorams,\nTriggers, Spiveycombs, and Spicers; and were repeated piecemeal to\nthe unhappy second member.\n\nHe had secured for himself a separate sitting-room at the \"Percy\nStandard,\" thinking that thus he would have the advantage of being\nalone; but every one connected with his party came in and out of his\nroom as though it had been specially selected as a chamber for public\npurposes. Even Griffenbottom came into it to have interviews there\nwith Trigger, although at the moment Griffenbottom and Sir Thomas\nwere not considered to be on speaking terms. Griffenbottom in these\nmatters seemed to have the hide of a rhinoceros. He had chosen to\nquarrel with Sir Thomas. He had declared that he would not speak to a\ncolleague whose Parliamentary ideas and habits were so repulsive to\nhim. He had said quite aloud, that Trigger had never made a greater\nmistake in his life than in bringing Sir Thomas to the borough, and\nthat, let the petition go as it would, Sir Thomas should never be\nreturned for the borough again. He had spoken all these things,\nalmost in the hearing of Sir Thomas. And yet he would come to Sir\nThomas's private room, and sit there half the morning with a cigar in\nhis mouth! Mr. Pile would come in, and make most unpleasant speeches.\nMr. Spicer called continually, with his own ideas about the borough.\nThe thing could be still saved if enough money were spent. If Mr.\nGivantake were properly handled, and Mr. O'Blather duly provided for,\nthe two witnesses upon whom the thing really hung would not be found\nin Percycross when called upon to-morrow. That was Mr. Spicer's idea;\nand he was very eager to communicate it to Serjeant Burnaby. Trigger,\nin his energy, told Mr. Spicer to go and be ----. All this occurred\nin Sir Thomas's private room. And then Mr. Pabsby was there\nconstantly, till he at last was turned out by Trigger. In his agony,\nSir Thomas asked for another sitting-room; but was informed that the\nhouse was full. The room intended for the two members was occupied\nby Griffenbottom; but nobody ever suggested that the party might\nmeet there when Sir Thomas's vain request was made for further\naccommodation. Griffenbottom went on with his cigar, and Mr. Pile\nsat picking his teeth before the fire, and making unpleasant little\nspeeches.\n\nThe judge, who had hurried into Percycross from another town, and who\nopened the commission on the Monday evening, did not really begin\nhis work till the Tuesday morning. Jacky Joram had declared that the\ninquiry would last three days, he having pledged himself to be at\nanother town early on the following Friday. Serjeant Burnaby, whose\nfuture services were not in such immediate demand, was of opinion\nthat they would not get out of Percycross till Saturday night. Judge\nCrumbie, who was to try the case, and who had been trying similar\ncases ever since Christmas, was not due at his next town till the\nMonday; but it was understood by everybody that he intended if\npossible to spend his Saturday and Sunday in the bosom of his family.\nTrigger, however, had magnificent ideas. \"I believe we shall carry\nthem into the middle of next week,\" he said, \"if they choose to\ngo on with it.\" Trigger thoroughly enjoyed the petition; and even\nGriffenbottom, who was no longer troubled by gout, and was not now\nobliged to walk about the borough, did not seem to dislike it. But to\npoor Sir Thomas it was indeed a purgatory.\n\nThe sitting members were of course accused, both as regarded\nthemselves and their agents, of every crime known in electioneering\ntactics. Votes had been personated. Votes had been bought. Votes\nhad been obtained by undue influence on the part of masters and\nlandlords, and there had been treating of the most pernicious and\ncorrupt description. As to the personating of votes, that according\nto Mr. Trigger, had been merely introduced as a pleasant commencing\nfiction common in Parliamentary petitions. There had been nothing\nof the kind, and nobody supposed that there had, and it did not\nsignify. Of undue influence,--what purists choose to call undue\ninfluence,--there had of course been plenty. It was not likely that\nmasters paying thousands a year in wages were going to let these men\nvote against themselves. But this influence was so much a matter\nof course that it could not be proved to the injury of the sitting\nmembers. Such at least was Mr. Trigger's opinion. Mr. Spicer might\nhave been a little imprudent with his men; but no case could be\nbrought up in which a man had been injured. Undue influence at\nPercycross was--\"gammon.\" So said Mr. Trigger, and Jacky Joram agreed\nwith Mr. Trigger. Serjeant Burnaby rubbed his hands, and would give\nno opinion till he had heard the evidence. That votes had been bought\nduring the day of the election there was no doubt on earth. On this\nmatter great secrecy prevailed, and Sir Thomas could not get a word\nspoken in his own hearing. It was admitted, however, that votes had\nbeen bought. There were a dozen men, perhaps more than a dozen,\nwho would prove that one Glump had paid them ten shillings a piece\nbetween one and two on the day of the election. There was a general\nbelief that perhaps over a hundred had been bought at that rate. But\nTrigger was ready to swear that he did not know whence Glump had got\nthe money, and Glump himself was,--nobody knew where Glump was, but\nstrange whispers respecting Glump were floating about the borough.\nTrigger was disposed to believe that they, on their side, could prove\nthat Glump had really been employed by Westmacott's people to vitiate\nthe election. He was quite sure that nothing could connect Glump\nwith him as an agent on behalf of Griffenbottom and Underwood. So\nMr. Trigger asserted with the greatest confidence; but what was in\nthe bottom of Mr. Trigger's mind on this subject no one pretended\nto know. As for Glump himself he was a man who would certainly\ntake payment from anybody for any dirty work. It was the general\nimpression through the borough that Glump had on this occasion been\nhired by Trigger, and Trigger certainly enjoyed the prestige which\nwas thus conferred upon him.\n\nAs to the treating,--there could be no doubt about that. There had\nbeen treating. The idea of conducting an election at Percycross\nwithout beer seemed to be absurd to every male and female\nPercycrossian. Of course the publicans would open their taps and then\nsend in their bills for beer to the electioneering agents. There was\na prevailing feeling that any interference with so ancient a practice\nwas not only un-English, but unjust also;--that it was beyond the\npower of Parliament to enforce any law so abominable and unnatural.\nTrigger was of opinion that though there had been a great deal\nof beer, no attempt would be made to prove that votes had been\ninfluenced by treating. There had been beer on both sides, and\nTrigger hoped sincerely that there might always be beer on both sides\nas long as Percycross was a borough.\n\nSir Thomas found that his chance of success was now spoken of in a\ntone very different from that which had been used when the matter\nwas discussed in his own chamber. He had been then told that it was\nhardly possible that he should keep his seat;--and he had in fact\nbeen asked to resign it. Though sick enough of Percycross, this\nhe would not do in the manner then proposed to him. Now he was\nencouraged in the fight;--but the encouragement was of a nature which\ngave him no hope, which robbed him even of the wish to have a hope.\nIt was all dirt from beginning to end. Whatever might be the verdict\nof the judge,--from the judge the verdict was now to come,--he should\nstill believe that nothing short of absolute disfranchisement would\nmeet the merits of the case.\n\nThe accusation with regard to the personation of votes was\nabandoned,--Serjeant Burnaby expressing the most extreme disgust that\nany such charge should have been made without foundation,--although\nhe himself at the borough which he had last left had brought forward\nthe same charge on behalf of his then clients, and had abandoned it\nin the same way. Then the whole of the remaining hours of the Tuesday\nand half the Wednesday were passed in showing that Messrs. Spicer,\nSpiveycomb, and Roodylands had forced their own men to vote blue. Mr.\nSpicer had dismissed one man and Mr. Spiveycomb two men; but both\nthese gentlemen swore that the men dismissed were not worth their\nsalt, and had been sent adrift upon the world by no means on account\nof their politics. True: they had all voted for Moggs; but then they\nhad done that simply to spite their late master. On the middle of\nWednesday, when the matter of intimidation had been completed,--the\nresult still lying in the bosom of Baron Crumbie,--Mr. Trigger\nthought that things were looking up. That was the report which he\nbrought to Mr. Griffenbottom, who was smoking his midday cigar in\nSir Thomas's arm-chair, while Sir Thomas was endeavouring to master\nthe first book of Lord Verulam's later treatise \"De dignitate\nscientiarum,\" seated in a cane-bottomed chair in a very small\nbed-room up-stairs.\n\nBy consent the question of treating came next. Heaven and earth were\nbeing moved to find Glump. When the proposition was made that the\ntreating should come before the bribery Trigger stated in court that\nhe was himself doing his very best to find the man. There might yet\nbe a hope, though, alas, the hope was becoming slighter every hour.\nHis own idea was that Glump had been sent away to Holland by,--well,\nhe did not care to name the parties by whom he believed that Glump\nhad been expatriated. However, there might be a chance. The counsel\non the other side remarked that there might, indeed, be a chance.\nBaron Crumbie expressed a hope that Mr. Glump might make his\nappearance,--for the sake of the borough, which might otherwise fare\nbadly; and then the great beer question was discussed for two entire\ndays.\n\nThere was no doubt about the beer. Trigger, who was examined after\nsome half-score of publicans, said openly that thirsty Conservative\nsouls had been allowed to slake their drought at the joint expense\nof the Conservative party in the borough,--as thirsty Liberal souls\nhad been encouraged to do on the other side. When reminded that any\nmalpractice in that direction on the part of a beaten candidate could\nnot affect the status of the elected members, he replied that all\nthe beer consumed in Percycross during the election had not, to the\nbest of his belief, affected a vote. The Percycrossians were not men\nto vote this way or that because of beer! He would not believe it\neven in regard to a Liberal Percycrossian. It might be so in other\nboroughs, but of other boroughs he knew absolutely nothing. Who paid\nfor the beer? Mr. Trigger at once acknowledged that it was paid for\nout of the general funds provided for the election. Who provided\nthose funds? There was not a small amount of fencing on this point,\nduring the course of which Mr. Joram snapped very sharply and very\nfrequently at the counsel on the other side,--hoping thereby somewhat\nto change the issue. But at last there came out these two facts,\nthat there was a general fund, to which all Conservatives might\nsubscribe, and that the only known subscribers to this fund were\nMr. Griffenbottom, Sir Thomas Underwood, and old Mr. Pile, who had\ngiven a \u00c2\u00a310 note,--apparently with the view of proving that there\nwas a fund. It was agreed on all hands that treating had been\nsubstantiated; but it was remarked by some that Baron Crumbie had\nnot been hard upon treating in other boroughs. After all, the result\nwould depend upon what the Baron thought about Mr. Glump. It might be\nthat he would recommend further inquiry, under a special commission,\ninto the practices of the borough, because of the Glump iniquities,\nand that he should, nevertheless, leave the seats to the sitting\nmembers. That seemed to be Mr. Trigger's belief on the evening of the\nThursday, as he took his brandy and water in Sir Thomas's private\nsitting-room.\n\nThere is nothing in the world so brisk as the ways and manners of\nlawyers when in any great case they come to that portion of it which\nthey know to be the real bone of the limb and kernel of the nut. The\ndoctor is very brisk when after a dozen moderately dyspeptic patients\nhe comes on some unfortunate gentleman whose gastric apparatus\nis gone altogether. The parson is very brisk when he reaches the\nminatory clause in his sermon. The minister is very brisk when he\nasks the House for a vote, telling his hoped-for followers that this\nspecial point is absolutely essential to his government. Unless he\ncan carry this, he and all those hanging on to him must vacate their\nplaces. The horse-dealer is very brisk when, after four or five\nindifferent lots, he bids his man bring out from the stable the\nlast thorough-bred that he bought, and the very best that he ever\nput his eye on. But the briskness of none of these is equal to the\nbriskness of the barrister who has just got into his hands for\ncross-examination him whom we may call the centre witness of a great\ncase. He plumes himself like a bullfinch going to sing. He spreads\nhimself like a peacock on a lawn. He perks himself like a sparrow on\na paling. He crows amidst his attorneys and all the satellites of\nthe court like a cock among his hens. He puts his hands this way and\nthat, settling even the sunbeams as they enter, lest a moat should\ndisturb his intellect or dull the edge of his subtlety. There is a\nmodesty in his eye, a quiescence in his lips, a repose in his limbs,\nunder which lie half-concealed,--not at all concealed from those\nwho have often watched him at his work,--the glance, the tone, the\nspring, which are to tear that unfortunate witness into pieces,\nwithout infringing any one of those conventional rules which\nhave been laid down for the guidance of successful well-mannered\nbarristers.\n\nSerjeant Burnaby, though astute, was not specially brisk by nature;\nbut on this Friday morning Mr. Joram was very brisk indeed. There\nwas a certain Mr. Cavity, who had acted as agent for Westmacott, and\nwho,--if anybody on the Westmacott side had been so guilty,--had been\nguilty in the matter of Glump's absence. Perhaps we should not do\njustice to Mr. Joram's acuteness were we to imagine him as believing\nthat Glump was absent under other influence than that used on behalf\nof the conservative side; but there were subsidiary points on which\nMr. Cavity might be made to tell tales. Of course there had been\nextensive bribery for years past in Percycross on the liberal as well\nas on the conservative side, and Mr. Joram thought that he could make\nMr. Cavity tell a tale. And then, too, he could be very brisk in that\naffair of Glump. He was pretty nearly sure that Mr. Glump could not\nbe connected by evidence with either of the sitting members or with\nany of their agents. He would prove that Glump was neutral ground,\nand that as such his services could not be traced to his friend, Mr.\nTrigger. Mr. Joram on this occasion was very brisk indeed.\n\nA score of men were brought up, ignorant, half-dumb, heavy-browed\nmen, all dressed in the amphibious garb of out-o'-door town\nlabourers,--of whom there exists a class of hybrids between the rural\nlabourer and the artizan,--each one of whom acknowledged that after\nnoon on the election day he received ten shillings, with instructions\nto vote for Griffenbottom and Underwood. And they did vote for\nGriffenbottom and Underwood. At all elections in Percycross they had,\nas they now openly acknowledged, waited till about the same hour on\nthe day of election, and then somebody had bought their votes for\nsomebody. On this occasion the purchase had been made by Mr. Glump.\nThere was a small empty house up a little alley in the town, to which\nthere was a back door opening on a vacant space in the town known\nas Grinder's Green. They entered this house by one door, leaving it\nby the other, and as they passed through, Glump gave to each man\nhalf a sovereign with instructions, entering their names in a small\nbook;--and then they went in a body and voted for Griffenbottom and\nUnderwood. Each of the twenty knew nearly all the other twenty, but\nnone of them knew any other men who had been paid by Glump. Of course\nnone of them had the slightest knowledge of Glump's present abode.\nIt was proved that at the last election Glump had acted for the\nLiberals; but it was also proved that at the election before he had\nbeen active in bribing for the Conservatives. Very many things were\nproved,--if a thing be proved when supported by testimony on oath.\nTrigger proved that twenty votes alone could have been of no\nservice, and would not certainly have been purchased in a manner so\ndetrimental. According to Trigger's views it was as clear as daylight\nthat Glump had not been paid by them. When asked whether he would\ncause Mr. Glump to be repaid that sum of ten pounds, should Mr. Glump\nsend in any bill to that effect, he simply stated that Mr. Glump\nwould certainly send no such bill to him. He was then asked whether\nit might not be possible that the money should be repaid by Messrs.\nGriffenbottom and Underwood through his hands, reaching Glump again\nby means of a further middleman. Mr. Trigger acknowledged that were\nsuch a claim made upon him by any known agent of his party, he would\nendeavour to pass the ten pounds through the accounts, as he thought\nthat there should be a certain feeling of honour in these things;\nbut he did not for a moment think that any one acting with him would\nhave dealings with Glump. On the Saturday morning, when the case was\nstill going on, to the great detriment of Baron Grumble's domestic\nhappiness, Glump had not yet been caught. It seemed that the man\nhad no wife, no relative, no friend. The woman at whose house he\nlodged declared that he often went and came after this fashion. The\nrespect with which Glump's name was mentioned, as his persistency in\ndisobeying the law and his capability for intrigue were thus proved,\nwas so great, that it was a pity he could not have been there to\nenjoy it. For the hour he was a great man in Percycross,--and the\ngreater because Baron Crumbie did not cease to threaten him with\nterrible penalties.\n\nMuch other bribery was alleged, but none other was distinctly brought\nhome to the agents of the sitting members. As to bringing bribery\nhome to Mr. Griffenbottom himself;--that appeared to be out of the\nquestion. Nobody seemed even to wish to do that. The judge, as it\nappeared, did not contemplate any result so grave and terrible as\nthat. There was a band of freemen of whom it was proved that they had\nall been treated with most excessive liberality by the corporation of\nthe town; and it was proved, also, that a majority of the corporation\nwere supporters of Mr. Griffenbottom. A large number of votes\nhad been so secured. Such, at least, was the charge made by the\npetitioners. But this allegation Jacky Joram laughed to scorn. The\ncorporation, of course, used the charities and privileges of the town\nas they thought right; and the men voted,--as they thought right. The\nonly cases of bribery absolutely proved were those manipulated by\nGlump, and nothing had been adduced clearly connecting Glump and\nthe Griffenbottomites. Mr. Trigger was in ecstasies; but Mr. Joram\nsomewhat repressed him by referring to these oracular words which had\nfallen from the Baron in respect to the corporation. \"A corporation\nmay be guilty as well as an individual,\" the Baron had said. Jacky\nJoram had been very eager in assenting to the Baron, but in asserting\nat the same time that the bribery must be proved. \"It won't be\nassumed, my lord, that a corporation has bribed because it has\npolitical sympathies.\" \"It should have none,\" said the Baron. \"Human\nnature is human nature, my lord,--even in corporations,\" said Jacky\nJoram. This took place just before luncheon,--which was made a solemn\nmeal on all sides, as the judge had declared his intention of sitting\ntill midnight, if necessary.\n\nImmediately after the solemn meal Mr. Griffenbottom was examined.\nIt had been the declared purpose of the other side to turn Mr.\nGriffenbottom inside out. Mr. Griffenbottom and his conduct had on\nvarious former occasions been the subject of parliamentary petitions\nunder the old form; but on such occasions the chief delinquent\nhimself was never examined. Now Mr. Griffenbottom would be made to\ntell all that he knew, not only of his present, but of his past,\niniquities. And yet Mr. Griffenbottom told very little; and it\ncertainly did seem to the bystanders, that even the opposing counsel,\neven the judge on the bench, abstained from their prey because\nhe was a member of Parliament. It was notorious to all the world\nthat Griffenbottom had debased the borough; had so used its venal\ntendencies as to make that systematic which had before been too\nfrequent indeed, but yet not systematized; that he had trained the\nrising generation of Percycross politicians to believe in political\ncorruption;--and yet he escaped that utter turning inside out of\nwhich men had spoken.\n\nThe borough had cost him a great deal of money certainly; but as far\nas he knew the money had been spent legally. It had at least always\nbeen his intention before an election was commenced that nothing\nillegal should be done. He had no doubt always afterwards paid sums\nof money the use of which he did not quite understand, and as to some\nof which he could not but fear that it had been doubtfully applied.\nThe final accounts as to the last election had not reached him, but\nhe did not expect to be charged with improper expenses. There no\ndoubt would be something for beer, but that was unavoidable. As to\nMr. Glump he knew literally nothing of the man,--nor had he wanted\nany such man's assistance. Twenty votes indeed! Let them look at his\nplace upon the poll. There had been a time in the day when twenty\nvotes this way or that might be necessary to Sir Thomas. He had been\ntold that it was so. On the day of the election his own position\non the poll had been so certain to him, that he should not have\ncared,--that is, for himself,--had he heard that Glump was buying\nvotes against him. He considered it to be quite out of the question\nthat Glump should have bought votes for him,--with any purpose of\nserving him. And so Mr. Griffenbottom escaped from the adverse\ncounsel and from the judge.\n\nThere was very little in the examination of Sir Thomas Underwood to\ninterest any one. No one really suspected him of corrupt practices.\nIn all such cases the singular part of the matter is that everybody,\nthose who are concerned and those who are not concerned, really know\nthe whole truth which is to be investigated; and yet, that which\neverybody knows cannot be substantiated. There were not five men in\ncourt who were not certain that Griffenbottom was corrupt, and that\nSir Thomas was not; that the borough was rotten as a six-months-old\negg; that Glump had acted under one of Trigger's aides-de-camp; that\nintimidation was the law of the borough; and that beer was used so\nthat men drunk might not fear that which sober they had not the\ncourage to encounter. All this was known to everybody; and yet, up\nto the last, it was thought by many in Percycross that corruption,\nacknowledged, transparent, egregious corruption, would prevail even\nin the presence of a judge. Mr. Trigger believed it to the last.\n\nBut it was not so thought by the Jacky Jorams or by the Serjeant\nBurnabys. They made their final speeches,--the leading lawyer on each\nside, but they knew well what was coming. At half-past seven, for to\nso late an hour had the work been continued, the judge retired to\nget a cup of tea, and returned at eight to give his award. It was as\nfollows:--\n\nAs to the personation of votes, there should have been no allegation\nmade. In regard to the charge of intimidation it appeared that the\nsystem prevailed to such an extent as to make it clear to him that\nPercycross was unfit to return representatives to Parliament. In the\nmatter of treating he was not quite prepared to say that had no other\ncharge been made he should have declared this election void, but of\nthat also there had been sufficient to make him feel it to be his\nduty to recommend to the Speaker of the House of Commons that further\ninquiry should be made as to the practices of the borough. And as\nto direct bribery, though he was not prepared to say that he could\nconnect the agents of the members with what had been done,--and\ncertainly he could not connect either of the two members\nthemselves,--still, quite enough had been proved to make it\nimperative upon him to declare the election void. This he should\ndo in his report to the Speaker, and should also advise that a\ncommission be held with the view of ascertaining whether the\nprivilege of returning members of Parliament should remain with the\nborough. With Griffenbottom he dealt as tenderly as he did with Sir\nThomas, sending them both forth to the world, unseated indeed, but as\ninnocent, injured men.\n\nThere was a night train up to London at 10 P.M., by which on that\nevening Sir Thomas Underwood travelled, shaking off from his feet as\nhe entered the carriage the dust of that most iniquitous borough.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV.\n\n\"NEVER GIVE A THING UP.\"\n\n\nMr. Neefit's conduct during this period of disappointment was not\nexactly what it should to have been, either in the bosom of his\nfamily or among his dependents in Conduit Street. Herr Bawwah, over\na pot of beer in the public-house opposite, suggested to Mr. Waddle\nthat \"the governor might be ----,\" in a manner that affected Mr.\nWaddle greatly. It was an eloquent and energetic expression of\nopinion,--almost an expression of a settled purpose as coming from\nthe German as it did come; and Waddle was bound to admit that cause\nhad been given. \"Fritz,\" said Waddle pathetically, \"don't think about\nit. You can't better the wages.\" Herr Bawwah looked up from his pot\nof beer and muttered a German oath. He had been told that he was\nbeastly, skulking, pig-headed, obstinate, drunken, with some other\nperhaps stronger epithets which may be omitted,--and he had been told\nthat he was a German. In that had lain the venom. There was the word\nthat rankled. He had another pot of beer, and though it was then only\ntwelve o'clock on a Monday morning Herr Bawwah swore that he was\ngoing to make a day of it, and that old Neefit might cut out the\nstuff for himself if he pleased. As they were now at the end of\nMarch, which is not a busy time of the year in Mr. Neefit's trade,\nthe great artist's defalcation was of less immediate importance;\nbut, as Waddle knew, the German was given both to beer and obstinacy\nwhen aroused to wrath; and what would become of the firm should the\nobstinacy continue?\n\n\"Where's that pig-headed German brute?\" asked Mr. Neefit, when Mr.\nWaddle returned to the establishment. Mr. Waddle made no reply; and\nwhen Neefit repeated the question with a free use of the epithets\npreviously omitted by us, Waddle still was dumb, leaning over his\nledger as though in that there were matters so great as to absorb his\npowers of hearing. \"The two of you may go and be ---- together!\" said\nMr. Neefit. If any order requiring immediate obedience were contained\nin this, Mr. Waddle disobeyed that order. He still bent himself over\nthe ledger, and was dumb. Waddle had been trusted with his master's\nprivate view in the matter of the Newton marriage, and felt that on\nthis account he owed a debt of forbearance to the unhappy father.\n\nThe breeches-maker was in truth very unhappy. He had accused his\nGerman assistant of obstinacy, but the German could hardly have been\nmore obstinate than his master. Mr. Neefit had set his heart upon\nmaking his daughter Mrs. Newton, and had persisted in declaring that\nthe marriage should be made to take place. The young man had once\ngiven him a promise, and should be compelled to keep the promise\nso given. And in these days Mr. Neefit seemed to have lost that\ndiscretion for which his friends had once given him credit. On the\noccasion of his visit to the Moonbeam early in the hunting season he\nhad spoken out very freely among the sportsmen there assembled; and\nfrom that time all reticence respecting his daughter seemed to have\nbeen abandoned. He had paid the debts of this young man, who was now\nlord of wide domains, when the young man hadn't \"a red copper in his\npocket,\"--so did Mr. Neefit explain the matter to his friends,--and\nhe didn't intend that the young man should be off his bargain.\n\"No;--he wasn't going to put up with that;--not if he knew it.\" All\nthis he declared freely to his general acquaintance. He was very\neloquent on the subject in a personal interview which he had with Mr.\nMoggs senior, in consequence of a visit made to Hendon by Mr. Moggs\njunior, during which he feared that Polly had shown some tendency\ntowards yielding to the young politician. Mr. Moggs senior might take\nthis for granted;--that if Moggs junior made himself master of Polly,\nit would be of Polly pure and simple, of Polly without a shilling of\ndowry. \"He'll have to take her in her smock.\" That was the phrase in\nwhich Mr. Neefit was pleased to express his resolution. To all of\nwhich Mr. Moggs senior answered never a word. It was on returning\nfrom Mr. Moggs's establishment in Bond Street to his own in Conduit\nStreet that Mr. Neefit made himself so very unpleasant to the\nunfortunate German. When Ontario put on his best clothes, and took\nhimself out to Hendon on the previous Sunday, he did not probably\ncalculate that, as one consequence of that visit, the Herr Bawwah\nwould pass a whole week of intoxication in the little back parlour of\nthe public-house near St. George's Church.\n\nIt may be imagined how very unpleasant all this must have been to\nMiss Neefit herself. Poor Polly indeed suffered many things; but she\nbore them with an admirable and a persistent courage. Indeed, she\npossessed a courage which greatly mitigated her sufferings. Let her\nfather be as indiscreet as he might, he could not greatly lower her,\nas long as she herself was prudent. It was thus that Polly argued\nwith herself. She knew her own value, and was not afraid that she\nshould ever lack a lover when she wanted to find a husband. Of course\nit was not a nice thing to be thrown at a man's head, as her father\nwas constantly throwing her at the head of young Newton; but such a\nman as she would give herself to at last would understand all that.\nOntario Moggs, could she ever bring herself to accept Ontario, would\nnot be less devoted to her because of her father's ill-arranged\nambition. Polly could be obstinate too, but with her obstinacy there\nwas combined a fund of feminine strength which, as we think, quite\njustified the devotion of Ontario Moggs.\n\nAmidst all these troubles Mrs. Neefit also had a bad time of it; so\nbad a time that she was extremely anxious that Ontario should at once\ncarry off the prize;--Ontario, or the gasfitter, or almost anybody.\nNeefit was taking to drink in the midst of all this confusion, and\nwas making himself uncommonly unpleasant in the bosom of his family.\nOn the Sunday,--the Sunday before the Monday on which the Herr\ndecided that his wisest course of action would be to abstain from\nwork and make a beast of himself, in order that he might spite his\nmaster,--Mr. Neefit had dined at one o'clock, and had insisted on his\ngin-and-water and pipe immediately after his dinner. Now Mr. Neefit,\nwhen he took too much, did not fall into the extreme sins which\ndisgraced his foreman. He simply became very cross till he fell\nasleep, very heavy while sleeping, and more cross than ever when\nagain awake. While he was asleep on this Sunday afternoon Ontario\nMoggs came down to Hendon dressed in his Sunday best. Mrs. Neefit\nwhispered a word to him before he was left alone with Polly. \"You be\nround with her, and run your chance about the money.\" \"Mrs. Neefit,\"\nsaid Ontario, laying his hand upon his heart, \"all the bullion in the\nBank of England don't make a feather's weight in the balance.\" \"You\nnever was mercenary, Mr. Ontario,\" said the lady. \"My sweetheart is\nto me more than a coined hemisphere,\" said Ontario. The expression\nmay have been absurd, but the feeling was there.\n\nPolly was not at all coy of her presence,--was not so, though she\nhad been specially ordered by her father not to have anything to\nsay to that long-legged, ugly fool. \"Handsome is as handsome does,\"\nPolly had answered. Whereupon Mr. Neefit had shown his teeth and\ngrowled;--but Polly, though she loved her father, and after a fashion\nrespected him, was not afraid of him; and now, when her mother left\nher alone with Ontario, she was free enough of her conversation. \"Oh,\nPolly,\" he said, after a while, \"you know why I'm here.\"\n\n\"Yes; I know,\" said Polly.\n\n\"I don't think you do care for that young gentleman.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to break my heart about him, Mr. Moggs.\"\n\n\"I'd try to be the death of him, if you did.\"\n\n\"That would be a right down tragedy, because then you'd be hung,--and\nso there'd be an end of us all. I don't think I'd do that, Mr.\nMoggs.\"\n\n\"Polly, I sometimes feel as though I didn't know what to do.\"\n\n\"Tell me the whole story of how you went on down at Percycross. I was\nso anxious you should get in.\"\n\n\"Were you now?\"\n\n\"Right down sick at heart about it;--that I was. Don't you think we\nshould all be proud to know a member of Parliament?\"\n\n\"Oh; if that's all--\"\n\n\"I shouldn't think anything of Mr. Newton for being in Parliament.\nWhether he was in Parliament or out would be all the same. Of course\nhe's a friend, and we like him very well; but his being in Parliament\nwould be nothing. But if you were there--!\"\n\n\"I don't know what's the difference,\" said Moggs despondently.\n\n\"Because you're one of us.\"\n\n\"Yes; I am,\" said Moggs, rising to his legs and preparing himself\nfor an oration on the rights of labour. \"I thank my God that I am no\naristocrat.\" Then there came upon him a feeling that this was not a\ntime convenient for political fervour. \"But, I'll tell you something,\nPolly,\" he said, interrupting himself.\n\n\"Well;--tell me something, Mr. Moggs.\"\n\n\"I'd sooner have a kiss from you than be Prime Minister.\"\n\n\"Kisses mean so much, Mr. Moggs,\" said Polly.\n\n\"I mean them to mean much,\" said Ontario Moggs. Whereupon Polly,\ndeclining further converse on that delicate subject, and certainly\nnot intending to grant the request made on the occasion, changed the\nsubject.\n\n\"But you will get in still;--won't you, Mr. Moggs? They tell me that\nthose other gentlemen ain't to be members any longer, because what\nthey did was unfair. Oughtn't that to make you member?\"\n\n\"I think it ought, if the law was right;--but it doesn't.\"\n\n\"Doesn't it now? But you'll try again;--won't you? Never give a thing\nup, Mr. Moggs, if you want it really.\" As the words left her lips she\nunderstood their meaning,--the meaning in which he must necessarily\ntake them,--and she blushed up to her forehead. Then she laughed as\nshe strove to recall the encouragement she had given him. \"You know\nwhat I mean, Mr. Moggs. I don't mean any silly nonsense about being\nin love.\"\n\n\"If that is silly, I am the silliest man in London.\"\n\n\"I think you are sometimes;--so I tell you fairly.\"\n\nIn the meantime Mr. Neefit had woke from his slumbers. He was in his\nold arm-chair in the little back room, where they had dined, while\nPolly with her lover was in the front parlour. Mrs. Neefit was seated\nopposite to Mr. Neefit, with an open Bible in her lap, which had been\nas potent for sleep with her as had been the gin-and-water with her\nhusband. Neefit suddenly jumped up and growled. \"Where's Polly?\" he\ndemanded.\n\n\"She's in the parlour, I suppose,\" said Mrs. Neefit doubtingly.\n\n\"And who is with her?\"\n\n\"Nobody as hadn't ought to be,\" said Mrs. Neefit.\n\n\"Who's there, I say?\" But without waiting for an answer, he stalked\ninto the front room. \"It's no use in life your coming here,\" he said,\naddressing himself at once to Ontario; \"not the least. She ain't\nfor you. She's for somebody else. Why can't one word be as good as\na thousand?\" Moggs stood silent, looking sheepish and confounded.\nIt was not that he was afraid of the father; but that he feared to\noffend the daughter should he address the father roughly. \"If she\ngoes against me she'll have to walk out of the house with just what\nshe's got on her back.\"\n\n\"I should be quite contented,\" said Ontario.\n\n\"But I shouldn't;--so you may just cut it. Anybody who wants her\nwithout my leave must take her in her smock.\"\n\n\"Oh, father!\" screamed Polly.\n\n\"That's what I mean,--so let's have done with it. What business have\nyou coming to another man's house when you're not welcome? When I\nwant you I'll send for you; and till I do you have my leave to stay\naway.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, Polly,\" said Ontario, offering the girl his hand.\n\n\"Good-bye, Mr. Moggs,\" said Polly; \"and mind you get into Parliament.\nYou stick to it, and you'll do it.\"\n\nWhen she repeated this salutary advice, it must have been that she\nintended to apply to the double event. Moggs at any rate took it in\nthat light. \"I shall,\" said he, as he opened the door and walked\ntriumphantly out of the house.\n\n\"Father,\" said Polly, as soon as they were alone, \"you've behaved\nvery bad to that young man.\"\n\n\"You be blowed,\" said Mr. Neefit.\n\n\"You have, then. You'll go on till you get me that talked about that\nI shall be ashamed to show myself. What's the good of me trying to\nbehave, if you keep going on like that?\"\n\n\"Why didn't you take that chap when he came after you down to\nMargate?\"\n\n\"Because I didn't choose. I don't care enough for him; and it's all\nno use of you going on. I wouldn't have him if he came twenty times.\nI've made up my mind, so I tell you.\"\n\n\"You're a very grand young woman.\"\n\n\"I'm grand enough to have a will of my own about that. I'm not going\nto be made to marry any man, I know.\"\n\n\"And you mean to take that long-legged shoemaker's apprentice.\"\n\n\"He's not a shoemaker's apprentice any more than I'm a\nbreeches-maker's apprentice.\" Polly was now quite in earnest, and in\nno mood for picking her words. \"He is a bootmaker by his trade; and\nI've never said anything about taking him.\"\n\n\"You've given him a promise.\"\n\n\"No; I've not.\"\n\n\"And you'd better not, unless you want to walk out of this house with\nnothing but the rags on your back. Ain't I doing it all for you?\nAin't I been sweating my life out these thirty years to make you a\nlady?\" This was hard upon Polly, as she was not yet one-and-twenty.\n\n\"I don't want to be a lady; no more than I am just by myself, like.\nIf I can't be a lady without being made one, I won't be a lady at\nall.\"\n\n\"You be blowed.\"\n\n\"There are different kinds of ladies, father. I want to be such a\none as neither you nor mother shall ever have cause to say I didn't\nbehave myself.\"\n\n\"You'd talk the figures off a milestone,\" said Mr. Neefit, as he\nreturned to his arm-chair, to his gin-and-water, to his growlings,\nand before long to his slumbers. Throughout the whole evening he was\nvery unpleasant in the bosom of his family,--which consisted on this\noccasion of his wife only, as Polly took the opportunity of going out\nto drink tea with a young lady friend. Neefit, when he heard this,\nsuggested that Ontario was drinking tea at the same house, and would\nhave pursued his daughter but for mingled protestations and menaces\nwhich his wife used for preventing such a violation of parental\nauthority. \"Moggs don't know from Adam where she is; and you never\nknowed her do anything of that kind. And you'll go about with your\nmad schemes and jealousies till you about ruin the poor girl; that's\nwhat you will. I won't have it. If you go, I'll go too, and I'll\nshame you. No; you shan't have your hat. Of course she'll be off some\nday, if you make the place that wretched that she can't live in it. I\nknow I would,--with the fust man as'd ask me.\" By these objurgations,\nby a pertinacious refusal as to his hat, and a little yielding in the\nmatter of gin-and-water, Mr. Neefit was at length persuaded to remain\nat home.\n\nOn the following morning he said nothing before he left home, but as\nsoon as he had opened his letters and spoken a few sharp things to\nthe two men in Conduit Street, he went off to Mr. Moggs senior. Of\nthe interview between Mr. Neefit and Mr. Moggs senior sufficient has\nalready been told. Then it was, after his return to his own shop,\nthat he so behaved as to drive the German artist into downright\nmutiny and unlimited beer. Through the whole afternoon he snarled at\nWaddle; but Waddle sat silent, bending over the ledger. One question\nWaddle did answer.\n\n\"Where's that pig-headed German gone?\" asked Mr. Neefit for the tenth\ntime.\n\n\"I believe he's cutting his throat about this time,\" said Mr. Waddle.\n\n\"He may wait till I come and sew it up,\" said the breeches-maker.\n\nAll this time Mr. Neefit was very unhappy. He knew, as well as did\nMr. Waddle or Polly, that he was misbehaving himself. He was by no\nmeans deficient in ideas of duty to his wife, to his daughter, and to\nhis dependents. Polly was the apple of his eye; his one jewel;--in\nhis estimation the best girl that ever lived. He admired her in all\nher moods, even though she would sometimes oppose his wishes with\ninvincible obstinacy. He knew in his heart that were she to marry\nOntario Moggs he would forgive her on the day of her marriage. He\ncould not keep himself from forgiving her though she were to marry a\nchimney-sweep. But, as he thought, a great wrong was being done him.\nHe could not bring himself to believe that Polly would not marry\nthe young Squire, if the young Squire would only be true to his\nundertaking; and then he could not endure that the young Squire\nshould escape from him, after having been, as it were, saved from\nruin by his money, without paying for the accommodation in some\nshape. He had some inkling of an idea that in punishing Ralph by\nmaking public the whole transaction, he would be injuring his\ndaughter as much as he injured Ralph. But the inkling did not\nsufficiently establish itself in his mind to cause him to desist.\nRalph Newton ought to be made to repeat his offer before all the\nworld; even though he should only repeat it to be again refused. The\nwhole of that evening he sat brooding over it, so that he might come\nto some great resolution.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI.\n\nMR. NEEFIT AGAIN.\n\n\nThe last few days in March and the first week in April were devoted\nby Ralph the heir to a final visit to the Moonbeam. He had resolved\nto finish the hunting season at his old quarters, and then to remove\nhis stud to Newton. The distinction with which he was welcomed\nby everybody at the Moonbeam must have been very gratifying to\nhim. Though he had made no response whatever to Lieutenant Cox's\nproposition as to a visit to Newton, that gentleman received him as a\nhero. Captain Fooks also had escaped from his regiment with the sole\nobject of spending these last days with his dear old friend. Fred\nPepper too was very polite, though it was not customary with Mr.\nPepper to display friendship so enthusiastic as that which warmed the\nbosoms of the two military gentlemen. As to Mr. Horsball, one might\nhave thought from his manner that he hoped to engage his customer to\nremain at the Moonbeam for the rest of his life. But it was not so.\nIt was in Mr. Horsball's nature to be civil to a rich hunting country\ngentleman; and it was the fact also that Ralph had ever been popular\nwith the world of the Moonbeam,--even at times when the spasmodic,\nand at length dilatory, mode of his payment must have become matter\nfor thought to the master of the establishment. There was no doubt\nabout the payments now, and Ralph's popularity was increased\nfourfold. Mrs. Horsball got out from some secluded nook a special\nbottle of orange-brandy in his favour,--which Lieutenant Cox would\nhave consumed on the day of its opening, had not Mrs. Horsball with\nconsiderable acrimony declined to supply his orders. The sister with\nringlets smiled and smirked whenever the young Squire went near the\nbar. The sister in ringlets was given to flirtations of this kind,\nwould listen with sweetest complacency to compliments on her beauty,\nand would return them with interest. But she never encouraged this\nsort of intimacy with gentlemen who did not pay their bills, or with\nthose whose dealings with the house were not of a profitable nature.\nThe man who expected that Miss Horsball would smile upon him because\nhe ordered a glass of sherry and bitters or half-a-pint of pale ale\nwas very much mistaken; but the softness of her smiles for those who\nconsumed the Moonbeam champagne was unbounded. Love and commerce\nwith her ran together, and regulated each other in a manner that was\nexceedingly advantageous to her brother. If I were about to open such\na house as the Moonbeam the first thing I should look for would be\na discreet, pleasant-visaged lady to assist me in the bar department,\nnot much under forty, with ringlets, having no particular leaning\ntowards matrimony, who knew how to whisper little speeches while she\nmade a bottle of cherry-brandy serve five-and-twenty turns at the\nleast. She should be honest, patient, graceful, capable of great\nlabour, grasping,--with that wonderful capability of being greedy for\nthe benefit of another which belongs to women,--willing to accept\nplentiful meals and a power of saving \u00c2\u00a320 a year as sufficient\nremuneration for all hardships, with no more susceptibility than a\nmilestone, and as indifferent to delicacy in language as a bargee.\nThere are such women, and very valuable women they are in that trade.\nSuch a one was Miss Horsball, and in these days the sweetest of her\nsmiles were bestowed upon the young Squire.\n\nRalph Newton certainly liked it, though he assumed an air of laughing\nat it all. \"One would think that old Hossy thought that I am going to\ngo on with this kind of thing,\" he said one morning to Mr. Pepper as\nthe two of them were standing about near the stable doors with pipes\nin their mouths. Old Hossy was the affectionate nickname by which Mr.\nHorsball was known among the hunting men of the B. B. Mr. Pepper and\nRalph had already breakfasted, and were dressed for hunting except\nthat they had not yet put on their scarlet coats. The meet was within\nthree miles of their head-quarters; the captain and the lieutenant\nwere taking advantage of the occasion by prolonged slumbers; and\nRalph had passed the morning in discussing hunting matters with Mr.\nPepper.\n\n\"He don't think that,\" said Mr. Pepper, taking a very convenient\nlittle implement out of his pocket, contrived for purposes of\npipe-smoking accommodation. He stopped down his tobacco, and drew the\nsmoke, and seemed by his manner to be giving his undivided attention\nto his pipe. But that was Mr. Pepper's manner. He was short in\nspeech, but always spoke with a meaning.\n\n\"Of course he doesn't really,\" said Ralph. \"I don't suppose I shall\never see the old house again after next week. You see when a man has\na place of one's own, if there be hunting there, one is bound to take\nit; if there isn't, one can go elsewhere and pick and choose.\"\n\n\"Just so,\" said Mr. Pepper.\n\n\"I like this kind of thing amazingly, you know.\"\n\n\"It has its advantages.\"\n\n\"Oh dear, yes. There is no trouble, you know. Everything done for\nyou. No servants to look after,--except just the fellow who brings\nyou your breeches and rides your second horse.\" Mr. Pepper never had\na second horse, or a man of his own to bring him his breeches, but\nthe allusion did not on that account vex him. \"And then you can do\nwhat you like a great deal more than you can in a house of your own.\"\n\n\"I should say so,\" remarked Mr. Pepper.\n\n\"I tell you what it is, Fred,\" continued Ralph, becoming very\nconfidential. \"I don't mind telling you, because you are a man who\nunderstands things. There isn't such a great pull after all in having\na property of your own.\"\n\n\"I shouldn't mind trying it,--just for a year or so,\" said Mr.\nPepper.\n\n\"I suppose not,\" said Ralph, chuckling in his triumph. \"And yet there\nisn't so much in it. What does it amount to when it's all told? You\nkeep horses for other fellows to ride, you buy wine for other fellows\nto drink, you build a house for other fellows to live in. You've a\ndeal of business to do, and if you don't mind it you go very soon to\nthe dogs. You have to work like a slave, and everybody gets a pull at\nyou. The chances are you never have any ready money, and become as\nstingy as an old file. You have to get married because of the family,\nand the place, and all that kind of thing. Then you have to give\ndinners to every old fogy, male and female, within twenty miles\nof you, and before you know where you are you become an old fogy\nyourself. That's about what it is.\"\n\n\"You ought to know,\" said Mr. Pepper.\n\n\"I've been expecting it all my life,--of course. It was what I was\nborn to, and everybody has been telling me what a lucky fellow I am\nsince I can remember. Now I've got it, and I don't find it comes to\nso very much. I shall always look back upon the dear old Moonbeam,\nand the B. B., and Hossy's wonderful port wine with regret. It hasn't\nbeen very swell, you know, but it's been uncommonly cosy. Don't you\nthink so?\"\n\n\"You see I wasn't born to anything better,\" said Mr. Pepper.\n\nJust at this moment Cox and Fooks came out of the house. They had\nnot as yet breakfasted, but had thought that a mouthful of air in\nthe stable-yard might enable them to get through their toast and\nred herrings with an amount of appetite which had not as yet been\nvouchsafed to them. Second and third editions of that wonderful port\nhad been produced on the previous evening, and the two warriors had\nplayed their parts with it manfully. Fooks was bearing up bravely as\nhe made his way across the yard; but Cox looked as though his friends\nought to see to his making that journey to Australia very soon if\nthey intended him to make it at all. \"I'm blessed if you fellows\nhaven't been and breakfasted,\" said Captain Fooks.\n\n\"That's about it,\" said the Squire.\n\n\"You must be uncommon fond of getting up early.\"\n\n\"Do you know who gets the worm?\" asked Mr. Pepper.\n\n\"Oh, bother that,\" said Cox.\n\n\"There's nothing I hate so much as being told about that nasty worm,\"\nsaid Captain Fooks. \"I don't want a worm.\"\n\n\"But the early birds do,\" said Mr. Pepper.\n\nCaptain Fooks was rather given to be cross of mornings. \"I think, you\nknow, that when fellows say over night they'll breakfast together, it\nisn't just the sort of thing for one or two to have all the things\nbrought up at any unconscionable hour they please. Eh, Cox?\"\n\n\"I'm sure I don't know,\" said Cox. \"I shall just have another go of\nsoda and brandy with a devilled biscuit. That's all I want.\"\n\n\"Fooks had better go to bed again, and see if he can't get out the\nother side,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"Chaff doesn't mean anything,\" said Captain Fooks.\n\n\"That's as you take it,\" said Mr. Pepper.\n\n\"I shall take it just as I please,\" said Captain Fooks.\n\nJust at this moment Mr. Horsball came up to them, touching his hat\ncheerily in sign of the commencement of the day. \"You'll ride Mr.\nPepper's little 'orse, I suppose, sir?\" he said, addressing himself\nto the young Squire.\n\n\"Certainly,--I told Larking I would.\"\n\n\"Exactly, Mr. Newton. And Banker might as well go out as second.\"\n\n\"I said Brewer. Banker was out on Friday.\"\n\n\"That won't be no odds, Mr. Newton. The fact is. Brewer's legs is a\nlittle puffed.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said the Squire.\n\n\"Well, old Hossy,\" said Lieutenant Cox, summing up all his energy in\nan attempt at matutinal joviality as he slapped the landlord on the\nback, \"how are things going with you?\"\n\nMr. Horsball knew his customers, and did not like being slapped\non the back with more than ordinary vigour by such a customer as\nLieutenant Cox. \"Pretty well, I thank you, Mr. Cox,\" said he. \"I\ndidn't take too much last night, and I eat my breakfast 'earty this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"There is one for you, young man,\" said Captain Fooks. Whereupon\nthe Squire laughed heartily. Mr. Horsball went on nodding his\nhead, intending to signify his opinion that he had done his work\nthoroughly; Mr. Pepper, standing on one foot with the other raised\non a horse-block, looked on without moving a muscle of his face. The\nlieutenant was disgusted, but was too weak in his inner man to be\ncapable of instant raillery;--when, on a sudden, the whole aspect of\nthings was changed by the appearance of Mr. Neefit in the yard.\n\n\"D----tion!\" exclaimed our friend Ralph. The apparition had been so\nsudden that the Squire was unable to restrain himself. Mr. Neefit, as\nthe reader will perhaps remember, had been at the Moonbeam before. He\nhad written letters which had been answered, and then letters,--many\nletters,--to which no reply had been given. In respect of the Neefit\narrangements Ralph Newton felt himself to be peculiarly ill-used by\npersecutions such as these, because he had honestly done his best\nto make Polly his wife. No doubt he acknowledged that fortune had\nfavoured him almost miraculously, in first saving him from so\ninjurious a marriage by the action of the young lady, and then at\nonce bestowing upon him his estate. But the escape was the doing of\nfortune and Polly Neefit combined, and had not come of any intrigue\non his own part. He was in a position,--so he thought,--absolutely\nto repudiate Neefit, and to throw himself upon facts for his\nprotection;--but then it was undoubtedly the case that for a year\nor two Mr. Neefit could make his life a burden to him. He would\nhave bought off Neefit at a considerable price, had Neefit been\npurchaseable. But Neefit was not in this matter greedy for himself.\nHe wanted to make his daughter a lady, and he thought that this\nwas the readiest way to accomplish that object. The Squire, in his\nunmeasurable disgust, uttered the curse aloud; but then, remembering\nhimself, walked up to the breeches-maker with his extended hand. He\nhad borrowed the man's money. \"What's in the wind now, Mr. Neefit?\"\nhe said.\n\n\"What's in the wind, Captain? Oh, you know. When are you coming to\nsee us at the cottage?\"\n\n\"I don't think my coming would do any good. I'm not in favour with\nthe ladies there.\" Ralph was aware that all the men standing round\nhim had heard the story, and that nothing was to be gained by an\nimmediate attempt at concealment. It behoved him, above all things,\nto be upon his metal, to put a good face upon it, and to be at any\nrate equal to the breeches-maker in presence of mind and that kind of\ncourage which he himself would have called \"cheek.\"\n\n\"My money was in favour with you, Captain, when you promised as how\nyou would be on the square with me in regard to our Polly.\"\n\n\"Mr. Neefit,\" said Ralph, speaking in a low voice, but still clearly,\nso that all around him could hear him, \"your daughter and I can never\nbe more to each other than we are at present. She has decided that.\nBut I value her character and good name too highly to allow even you\nto injure them by such a discussion in a stableyard.\" And, having\nsaid this, he walked away into the house.\n\n\"My Polly's character!\" said the infuriated breeches-maker, turning\nround to the audience, and neglecting to follow his victim in his\ndetermination to vindicate his daughter. \"If my girl's character\ndon't stand higher nor his or any one's belonging to him I'll eat\nit!\"\n\n\"Mr. Newton meant to speak in favour of the young lady, not against\nher,\" said Mr. Pepper.\n\n\"Then why don't he come out on the square? Now, gents, I'll tell you\njust the whole of it. He came down to my little box, where I, and my\nmissus, and my girl lives quiet and decent, to borrow money;--and he\nborrowed it. He won't say as that wasn't so.\"\n\n\"And he's paid you the money back again,\" said Mr. Pepper.\n\n\"He have;--but just you listen. I know you, Mr. Pepper, and all about\nyou; and do you listen. He have paid it back. But when he come there\nborrowing money, he saw my girl; and, says he,--'I've got to sell\nthat 'eritance of mine for just what it 'll fetch.' 'That's bad,\nCaptain,' says I. 'It is bad,' says he. Then says he again, 'Neefit,\nthat girl of yours there is the sweetest girl as ever I put my eyes\non.' And so she is,--as sweet as a rose, and as honest as the sun,\nand as good as gold. I says it as oughtn't; but she is. 'It's a pity,\nNeefit,' says he,' about the 'eritance; ain't it?' 'Captain,' says\nI,--I used to call him Captain 'cause he come down quite familiar\nlike to eat his bit of salmon and drink his glass of wine. Laws,--he\nwas glad enough to come then, mighty grand as he is now.\"\n\n\"I don't think he's grand at all,\" said Mr. Horsball.\n\n\"Well;--do you just listen, gents. 'Captain,' says I, 'that 'eritance\nof yourn mustn't be sold no how. I says so. What's the figure as is\nwanted?' Well; then he went on to say as how Polly was the sweetest\ngirl he ever see;--and so we came to an understanding. He was to have\nwhat money he wanted at once, and then \u00c2\u00a320,000 down when he married\nPolly. He did have a thousand. And, now,--see what his little game\nis.\"\n\n\"But the young lady wouldn't have anything to say to him,\" suggested\nCaptain Fooks, who, even for the sake of his breakfast, could not\nomit to hear the last of so interesting a conversation.\n\n\"Laws, Captain Fooks, to hear the likes of that from you, who is an\nofficer and a gentleman by Act of Parliament! When you have anything\nsweet to say to a young woman, does she always jump down your throat\nthe first go off?\"\n\n\"If she don't come at the second time of asking I always go\nelsewhere,\" said Captain Fooks.\n\n\"Then it's my opinion you have a deal of travelling to do,\" said Mr.\nNeefit, \"and don't get much at the end of it. It's because he's come\nin for his 'eritance, which he never would have had only for me, that\nhe's demeaning himself this fashion. It ain't acting the gentleman;\nit ain't the thing; it's off the square. Only for me and my money\nthere wouldn't be an acre his this blessed minute;--d----d if there\nwould! I saved it for him, by my ready money,--just that I might see\nmy Polly put into a station as she'd make more genteel than she found\nit. That's what she would;--she has that manners, not to talk of her\nbeing as pretty a girl as there is from here to,--to anywheres. He\nmade me a promise, and he shall keep it. I'll worry the heart out\nof him else. Pay me back my money! Who cares for the money? I can\ntell guineas with him now, I'll be bound. I'll put it all in the\npapers,--I will. There ain't a soul shan't know it. I'll put the\nstory of it into the pockets of every pair of breeches as leaves my\nshop. I'll send it to every M. F. H. in the kingdom.\"\n\n\"You'll about destroy your trade, old fellow,\" said Mr. Pepper.\n\n\"I don't care for the trade, Mr. Pepper. Why have I worked like a\n'orse? It's only for my girl.\"\n\n\"I suppose she's not breaking her heart for him?\" said Captain Fooks.\n\n\"What she's a doing with her heart ain't no business of yours,\nCaptain Fooks. I'm her father, and I know what I'm about. I'll make\nthat young man's life a burden to him, if 'e ain't on the square\nwith my girl. You see if I don't. Mr. 'Orsball, I want a 'orse to go\na 'unting on to-day. You lets 'em. Just tell your man to get me a\n'orse. I'll pay for him.\"\n\n\"I didn't know you ever did anything in that way,\" said Mr. Horsball.\n\n\"I may begin if I please, I suppose. If I can't go no other way, I'll\ngo on a donkey, and I'll tell every one that's out. Oh, 'e don't know\nme yet,--don't that young gent.\"\n\nMr. Neefit did not succeed in getting any animal out of Mr.\nHorsball's stables, nor did he make further attempt to carry his last\nthreat into execution on that morning. Mr. Horsball now led the way\ninto the house, while Mr. Pepper mounted his nag. Captain Fooks and\nLieutenant Cox went in to their breakfast, and the unfortunate father\nfollowed them. It was now nearly eleven o'clock, and it was found\nthat Ralph's horses had been taken round to the other door, and that\nhe had already started. He said very little to any one during the\nday, though he was somewhat comforted by information conveyed to him\nby Mr. Horsball in the course of the afternoon that Mr. Neefit had\nreturned to London. \"You send your lawyer to him, Squire,\" said Mr.\nHorsball. \"Lawyers cost a deal of money, but they do make things\nstraight.\" This suggestion had also been made to him by his brother\nGregory.\n\nOn the following day Ralph went up to London, and explained all the\ncircumstances of the case to Mr. Carey. Mr. Carey undertook to do his\nbest to straighten this very crooked episode in his client's life.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII.\n\nTHE WAY WHICH SHOWS THAT THEY MEAN IT.\n\n\nIf this kind of thing were to go on, life wouldn't be worth having.\nThat was the feeling of Ralph, the squire of Newton, as he returned\non that Saturday from London to the Moonbeam; and so far Mr. Neefit\nhad been successful in carrying out his threat. Neefit had sworn\nthat he would make the young man's life a burden to him, and the\nburden was already becoming unbearable. Mr. Carey had promised to do\nsomething. He would, at any rate, see the infatuated breeches-maker\nof Conduit Street. In the meantime he had suggested one remedy of\nwhich Ralph had thought before,--\"If you were married to some one\nelse he'd give it up,\" Mr. Carey had suggested. That no doubt was\ntrue.\n\nRalph completed his sojourn at the Moonbeam, leaving that place at\nthe end of the first week in April, took a run down to his own place,\nand then settled himself up to London for the season. His brother\nGregory had at this time returned to the parsonage at Newton; but\nthere was an understanding that he was to come up to London and be\nhis brother's guest for the first fortnight in May. Ralph the heir\nhad taken larger rooms, and had a spare chamber. When Ralph had given\nthis invitation, he had expressed his determination of devoting his\nspring in town to an assiduous courtship of Mary Bonner. At the\nmoment in which he made that assertion down at Newton, the nuisance\nof the Neefit affair was less intolerable to him than it had since\nbecome. He had spoken cheerily of his future prospects, declaring\nhimself to be violently in love with Mary, though he declared at the\nsame time that he had no idea of breaking his heart for any young\nwoman. That last assertion was probably true.\n\nAs for living in the great house at the Priory all alone, that he\nhad declared to be impossible. Of course he would be at home for\nthe hunting next winter; but he doubted whether he should be there\nmuch before that time, unless a certain coming event should make it\nnecessary for him to go down and look after things. He thought it\nprobable that he should take a run abroad in July; perhaps go to\nNorway for the fishing in June. He was already making arrangements\nwith two other men for a move in August. He might be at home for\npartridge shooting about the middle of September, but he shouldn't\n\"go into residence\" at Newton before that. Thus he had spoken of it\nin describing his plans to his brother, putting great stress on his\nintention to devote the spring months to the lovely Mary. Gregory\nhad seen nothing wrong in all this. Ralph was now a rich man, and\nwas entitled to amuse himself. Gregory would have wished that his\nbrother would at once make himself happy among his own tenants\nand dependents, but that, no doubt, would come soon. Ralph did\nspend two nights at Newton after the scene with Neefit in the\nMoonbeam yard,--just that he might see his nags safe in their new\nquarters,--and then went up to London. He was hardly yet strong in\nheart, because such a trouble as that which vexed him in regard to\nPolly does almost make a man's life a burden. Ralph was gifted with\nmuch aptitude for throwing his troubles behind, but he hardly was yet\nable to rid himself of this special trouble. That horrid tradesman\nwas telling his story to everybody. Sir Thomas Underwood knew\nthe story; and so, he thought, did Mary Bonner. Mary Bonner, in\ntruth, did not know it; but she had thrown in Ralph's teeth, as an\naccusation against him, that he owed himself and his affections to\nanother girl; and Ralph, utterly forgetful of Clarissa and that now\nlong-distant scene on the lawn, had believed, and still did believe,\nthat Mary had referred to Polly Neefit. On the 10th of April he\nestablished himself at his new rooms in Spring Gardens, and was\ncareful in seeing that there was a comfortable little bed-room for\nhis brother Greg. His uncle had now been dead just six months, but he\nfelt as though he had been the owner of the Newton estate for years.\nIf Mr. Carey could only settle for him that trouble with Mr. Neefit,\nhow happy his life would be to him. He was very much in love with\nMary Bonner, but his trouble with Mr. Neefit was of almost more\nimportance to him than his love for Mary Bonner.\n\nIn the meantime the girls were living, as usual, at Popham Villa, and\nSir Thomas was living, as usual, in Southampton Buildings. He and his\ncolleague had been unseated, but it had already been decided by the\nHouse of Commons that no new writ should be at once issued, and that\nthere should be a commission appointed to make extended inquiry at\nPercycross in reference to the contemplated disfranchisement of the\nborough. There could be no possible connexion between this inquiry\nand the expediency of Sir Thomas living at home; but, after some\nfashion, he reconciled further delay to his conscience by the fact\nthat the Percycross election was not even yet quite settled. No doubt\nit would be necessary that he should again go to Percycross during\nthe sitting of the Commission.\n\nThe reader will remember the interview between Gregory Newton and\nClarissa, in which poor Clary had declared with so much emphasis her\ncertainty that his brother's suit to Mary must be fruitless. This she\nhad said, with artless energy, in no degree on her own behalf. She\nwas hopeless now in that direction, and had at last taught herself to\nfeel that the man was unworthy. The lesson had reached her, though\nshe herself was ignorant not only of the manner of the teaching, but\nof the very fact that she had been taught. She had pleaded, more\nthan once, that men did such things, and were yet held in favour and\nforgiven, let their iniquities have been what they might. She had\nhoped to move others by the doctrine; but gradually it had ceased to\nbe operative, even on herself. She could not tell how it was that her\npassion faded and died away. It can hardly be said that it died away;\nbut it became to herself grievous and a cause of soreness, instead of\na joy and a triumph. She no longer said, even to herself, that he was\nto be excused. He had come there, and had made a mere plaything of\nher,--wilfully. There was no earnestness in him, no manliness, and\nhardly common honesty. A conviction that it was so had crept into\nher poor wounded heart, in spite of those repeated assertions which\nshe had made to Patience as to the persistency of her own affection.\nFirst dismay and then wrath had come upon her when the man who ought\nto be her lover came to the very house in which she was living, and\nthere offered his hand to another girl, almost in her very presence.\nHad the sin been committed elsewhere, and with any rival other than\nher own cousin, she might have still clung to that doctrine of\nforgiveness, because the sinner was a man, and because it is the way\nof the world to forgive men. But the insult had been too close for\npardon; and now her wrath was slowly changing itself to contempt. Had\nMary accepted the man's offer this phase of feeling would not have\noccurred. Clarissa would have hated the woman, but still might have\nloved the man. But Mary had treated him as a creature absolutely\nbeneath her notice, had evidently despised him, and Mary's scorn\ncommunicated itself to Clarissa. The fact that Ralph was now Newton\nof Newton, absolutely in harbour after so many dangers of shipwreck,\nassisted her in this. \"I would have been true to him, though\nhe hadn't had a penny,\" she said to herself: \"I would never\nhave given him up though all the world had been against him.\"\nDebts, difficulties, an inheritance squandered, idle habits, even\nprofligacy, should not have torn him from her heart, had he possessed\nthe one virtue of meaning what he said when he told her that he loved\nher. She remembered the noble triumph she had felt when she declared\nto Mary that that other Ralph, who was to have been Mary's lover,\nwas welcome to the fine property. Her sole ambition had been to be\nloved by this man; but the man had been incapable of loving her.\nShe herself was pretty, and soft, bright on occasions, and graceful.\nShe knew so much of herself; and she knew, also, that Mary was far\nprettier than herself, and more clever. This young man to whom she\nhad devoted herself possessed no power of love for an individual,--no\ncapability of so joining himself to another human being as to feel,\nthat in spite of any superiority visible to the outside world, that\none should be esteemed by him superior to all others,--because of\nhis love. The young man had liked prettiness and softness and grace\nand feminine nicenesses; and seeing one who was prettier and more\ngraceful,--all which poor Clary allowed, though she was not so sure\nabout the softness and niceness,--had changed his aim without an\neffort! Ah, how different was poor Gregory!\n\nShe thought much of Gregory, reminding herself that as was her sorrow\nin regard to her own crushed hopes, so were his. His hopes, too, had\nbeen crushed, because she had been so obdurate to him. But she had\nnever been false. She had never whispered a word of love to Gregory.\nIt might be that his heart was as sore, but he had not been injured\nas she had been injured. She despised the owner of Newton Priory. She\nwould scorn him should he come again to her and throw himself at her\nfeet. But Gregory could not despise her. She had, indeed, preferred\nthe bad to the good. There had been lack of judgment. But there had\nbeen on her side no lack of truth. Yes;--she had been wrong in her\nchoice. Her judgment had been bad. And yet how glorious he had looked\nas he lay upon the lawn, hot from his rowing, all unbraced, brown and\nbold and joyous as a young god, as he bade her go and fetch him drink\nto slake his thirst! How proud, then, she had been to be ordered by\nhim, as though their mutual intimacies and confidences and loves were\nsufficient, when they too were alone together, to justify a reversal\nof those social rules by which the man is ordered to wait upon the\nwoman. There is nothing in the first flush of acknowledged love that\nis sweeter to the woman than this. All the men around her are her\nservants; but in regard to this man she may have the inexpressibly\ngreater pleasure of serving him herself. Clarissa had now thought\nmuch of these things, and had endeavoured to define to herself what\nhad been those gifts belonging to Ralph which had won from her her\nheart. He was not, in truth, handsomer than his brother Gregory,\nwas certainly less clever, was selfish in small things from habit,\nwhereas Gregory had no thought for his own comfort. It had all come\nfrom this,--that a black coat and a grave manner of life and serious\npursuits had been less alluring to her than idleness and pleasure. It\nhad suited her that her young god should be joyous, unbraced, brown,\nbold, and thirsty. She did not know Pope's famous line, but it all\nlay in that. She was innocent, pure, unknowing in the ways of vice,\nsimple in her tastes, conscientious in her duties, and yet she was\na rake at heart,--till at last sorrow and disappointment taught her\nthat it is not enough that a man should lie loose upon the grass with\ngraceful negligence and call for soda-water with a pleasant voice.\nGregory wore black clothes, was sombre, and was a parson;--but, oh,\nwhat a thing it is that a man should be true at heart!\n\nShe said nothing of her changing feelings to Mary, or even to\nPatience. The household at this time was not very gay or joyous.\nSir Thomas, after infinite vexation, had lost the seat of which\nthey had all been proud. Mary Bonner's condition was not felt to be\ndeplorable, as was that of poor Clary, and she certainly did not\ncarry herself as a lovelorn maiden. Of Mary Bonner it may be said\nthat no disappointment of that kind would affect her outward manner;\nnor would she in any strait of love be willing to make a confidence\nor to discuss her feelings. Whatever care of that kind might be\npresent to her would be lightened, if not made altogether as nothing,\nby her conviction that such loads should be carried in silence, and\nwithout any visible sign to the world that the muscles are overtaxed.\nBut it was known that the banished Ralph had, in the moment of his\nexpected prosperity, declared his purpose of giving all that he had\nto give to this beauty, and it was believed that she would have\naccepted the gift. It had, therefore, come to pass that the name\nof neither Ralph could be mentioned at the cottage, and that life\namong these maidens was sober, sedate, and melancholy. At last there\ncame a note from Sir Thomas to Patience. \"I shall be home to dinner\nto-morrow. I found the enclosed from R. N. this morning. I suppose\nhe must come. Affectionately, T. U.\" The enclosed note was as\nfollows:--\"Dear Sir Thomas, I called this morning, but old Stemm was\nas hard as granite. If you do not object I will run down to the villa\nto-morrow. If you are at home I will stay and dine. Yours ever, Ralph\nNewton.\"\n\nThe mind of Sir Thomas when he received this had been affected\nexactly as his words described. He had supposed that Ralph must come.\nHe had learned to hold his late ward in low esteem. The man was now\nbeyond all likelihood of want, and sailing with propitious winds; but\nSir Thomas, had he been able to consult his own inclinations, would\nhave had no more to do with him. And yet the young Squire had not\ndone anything which, as Sir Thomas thought, would justify him in\nclosing his doors against one to whom he had been bound in a manner\npeculiarly intimate. However, if his niece should choose at last\nto accept Ralph, the match would be very brilliant; and the uncle\nthought that it was not his duty to interfere between her and so\ngreat an advantage. Sir Thomas, in truth, did not as yet understand\nMary Bonner,--knew very little of her character; but he did know that\nit was incumbent on him to give her some opportunity of taking her\nbeauty to market. He wrote a line to Ralph, saying that he himself\nwould dine at home on the day indicated.\n\n\"Impossible!\" said Clary, when she was first told.\n\n\"You may be sure he's coming,\" said Patience.\n\n\"Then I shall go and spend the day with Mrs. Brownlow. I cannot stand\nit.\"\n\n\"My dear, he'll know why you are away.\"\n\n\"Let him know,\" said Clarissa. And she did as she said she would.\nWhen Sir Thomas came home at about four o'clock on the Thursday which\nRalph had fixed,--Thursday, the fourteenth of April,--he found that\nClarissa had flown. The fly was to be sent for her at ten, and it was\ncalculated that by the time she returned, Ralph would certainly have\ntaken his leave. Sir Thomas expressed neither anger nor satisfaction\nat this arrangement,--\"Oh; she has gone to Mrs. Brownlow's, has she?\nVery well. I don't suppose it will make much difference to Ralph.\"\n\"None in the least,\" said Patience, severely. \"Nothing of that kind\nwill make any difference to him.\" But at that time Ralph had been\nabove an hour in the house.\n\nWe will now return to Ralph and his adventures. He had come up to\nLondon with the express object of pressing his suit upon Mary Bonner;\nbut during his first day or two in London had busied himself rather\nwith the affairs of his other love. He had been with Mr. Carey, and\nMr. Carey had been with Mr. Neefit. \"He is the maddest old man that\nI ever saw,\" said Mr. Carey. \"When I suggested to him that you were\nwilling to make any reasonable arrangement,--meaning a thousand\npounds, or something of that kind,--I couldn't get him to understand\nme at all.\"\n\n\"I don't think he wants money,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"'Let him come down and eat a bit of dinner at the cottage,' said he,\n'and we'll make it all square.' Then I offered him a thousand pounds\ndown.\"\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\n\"Called to a fellow he had there with a knife in his hand, cutting\nleather, to turn me out of the shop. And the man would have done it,\ntoo, if I hadn't gone.\"\n\nThis was not promising, but on the following morning Ralph received a\nletter which put him into better heart. The letter was from Polly\nherself, and was written as follows:--\n\n\n   Alexandra Cottage, Hendon,\n   April 10th, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR SIR,\n\n   Father has been going on with all that nonsense of his,\n   and I think it most straightforward to write a letter\n   to you at once, so that things may be understood and\n   finished. Father has no right to be angry with you, anyway\n   not about me. He says somebody has come and offered him\n   money. I wish they hadn't, but perhaps you didn't send\n   them. There's no good in father talking about you and\n   me. Of course it was a great honour, and all that, but\n   I'm not at all sure that anybody should try to get above\n   themselves, not in the way of marrying. And the heart is\n   everything. So I've told father. If ever I bestow mine, I\n   think it will be to somebody in a way of business,--just\n   like father. So I thought I would just write to say that\n   there couldn't be anything between you and me, were it\n   ever so; only that I was very much honoured by your coming\n   down to Margate. I write this to you, because a very\n   particular friend advises me, and I don't mind telling you\n   at once,--it is Mr. Moggs. And I shall show it to father.\n   That is, I have written it twice, and shall keep the\n   other. It's a pity father should go on so, but he means it\n   for the best. And as to anything in the way of money,--oh,\n   Mr. Newton, he's a deal too proud for that.\n\n   Yours truly,\n\n   MARYANNE NEEFIT.\n\n\nAs to which letter the little baggage was not altogether true in one\nrespect. She did not keep a copy of the whole letter, but left out\nof that which she showed to her father the very material passage\nin which she referred to the advice of her particular friend, Mr.\nMoggs. Ralph, when he received this letter, felt really grateful to\nPolly, and wrote to her a pretty note, in which he acknowledged her\nkindness, and expressed his hope that she might always be as happy\nas she deserved to be. Then it was that he made up his mind to go\ndown at once to Popham Villa, thinking that the Neefit nuisance\nwas sufficiently abated to enable him to devote his time to a more\npleasurable pursuit.\n\nHe reached the villa between three and four, and learned from the\ngardener's wife at the lodge that Sir Thomas had not as yet returned.\nHe did not learn that Clarissa was away, and was not aware of that\nfact till they all sat down to dinner at seven o'clock. Much had been\ndone and much endured before that time came. He sauntered slowly up\nthe road, and looked about the grounds, hoping to find the young\nladies there, as he had so often done during his summer visits; but\nthere was no one to be seen, and he was obliged to knock at the door.\nHe was shown into the drawing-room, and in a few minutes Patience\ncame to him. There had been no arrangement between her and Mary as\nto the manner in which he should be received. Mary on a previous\noccasion had given him an answer, and really did believe that that\nwould be sufficient. He was, according to her thinking, a light,\ninconstant man, who would hardly give himself the labour necessary\nfor perseverance in any suit. Patience at once began to ask him\nafter his brother and the doings at the Priory. He had been so\nintimate at the house, and so dear to them all, that in spite of\nthe disapprobation with which he was now regarded by them, it was\nimpossible that there should not be some outer kindness. \"Ah,\" said\nhe, \"I do so look forward to the time when you will all be down\nthere. I have been so often welcome at your house, that it will be my\ngreatest pleasure to make you welcome there.\"\n\n\"We go so little from home,\" said Patience.\n\n\"But I am sure you will come to me. I know you would like to see\nGreg's parsonage and Greg's church.\"\n\n\"I should indeed.\"\n\n\"It is the prettiest church, I think, in England, and the park is\nvery nice. The whole house wants a deal of doing to, but I shall set\nabout it some day. I don't know a pleasanter neighbourhood anywhere.\"\nIt would have been so natural that Patience should tell him that he\nwanted a mistress for such a home; but she could not say the words.\nShe could not find the proper words, and soon left him, muttering\nsomething as to directions for her father's room.\n\nHe had been alone for twenty minutes when Mary came into the room.\nShe knew that Patience was not there; and had retreated up-stairs.\nBut there seemed to be a cowardice in such retreating, which\ndispleased herself. She, at any rate, had no cause to be afraid of\nMr. Newton. So she collected her thoughts, and arranged her gait,\nand went down, and addressed him with assumed indifference,--as\nthough there had never been anything between them beyond simple\nacquaintance. \"Uncle Thomas will be here soon, I suppose,\" she said.\n\n\"I hope he will give me half-an-hour first,\" Ralph answered. There\nwas an ease and grace always present in his intercourse with women,\nand a power of saying that which he desired to say,--which perhaps\narose from the slightness of his purposes and the want of reality in\nhis character.\n\n\"We see so little of him that we hardly know his hours,\" said Mary.\n\"Uncle Thomas is a sad truant from home.\"\n\n\"He always was, and I declare I think that Patience and Clary have\nbeen the better for it. They have learned things of which they would\nhave known nothing had he been with them every morning and evening. I\ndon't know any girls who are so sweet as they are. You know they have\nbeen like sisters to me.\"\n\n\"So I have been told.\"\n\n\"And when you came, it would have been like another sister coming;\nonly--\"\n\n\"Only what?\" said Mary, assuming purposely a savage look.\n\n\"That something else intervened.\"\n\n\"Of course it must be very different,--and it should be different.\nYou have only known me a few months.\"\n\n\"I have known you enough to wish to know you more closely than\nanybody else for the rest of my life.\"\n\n\"Mr. Newton, I thought you had understood me before.\"\n\n\"So I did.\" This he said with an assumed tone of lachrymose\ncomplaint. \"I did understand you,--thoroughly. I understood that I\nwas rebuked, and rejected, and disdained. But a man, if he is in\nearnest, does not give over on that account. Indeed, there are things\nwhich he can't give over. You may tell a man that he shouldn't drink,\nor shouldn't gamble; but telling will do no good. When he has once\nbegun, he'll go on with it.\"\n\n\"What does that mean?\"\n\n\"That love is as strong a passion, at any rate, as drinking or\ngambling. You did tell me, and sent me away, and rebuked me because\nof that tradesman's daughter.\"\n\n\"What tradesman's daughter?\" asked Mary. \"I have spoken of no\ntradesman's daughter. I gave you ample reason why you should not\naddress yourself to me.\"\n\n\"Of course there are ample reasons,\" said Ralph, looking into his\nhat, which he had taken from the table. \"The one,--most ample of all,\nis that you do not care for me.\"\n\n\"I do not,\" said Mary resolutely.\n\n\"Exactly;--but that is a sort of reason which a man will do his best\nto conquer. Do not misunderstand me. I am not such a fool as to think\nthat I can prevail in a day. I am not vain enough to think that I can\nprevail at all. But I can persist.\"\n\n\"It will not be of the slightest use; indeed, it cannot be allowed. I\nwill not allow it. My uncle will not allow it.\"\n\n\"When you told me that I was untrue to another person--; I think that\nwas your phrase.\"\n\n\"Very likely.\"\n\n\"I supposed you had heard that stupid story which had got round to my\nuncle,--about a Mr. Neefit's daughter.\"\n\n\"I had heard no stupid story.\"\n\n\"What then did you mean?\"\n\nMary paused a moment, thinking whether it might still be possible\nthat a good turn might be done for her cousin. That Clarissa had\nloved this man with her whole heart she had herself owned to Mary.\nThat the man had professed his love for Clary, Clary had also let\nher know. And Clary's love had endured even after the blow it had\nreceived from Ralph's offer to her cousin. All this that cousin knew;\nbut she did not know how that love had now turned to simple soreness.\n\"I have heard nothing of the man's daughter,\" said Mary.\n\n\"Well then?\"\n\n\"But I do know that before I came here at all you had striven to gain\nthe affections of my cousin.\"\n\n\"Clarissa!\"\n\n\"Yes; Clarissa. Is it not so?\" Then she paused, and Ralph remembered\nthe scene on the lawn. In very truth it had never been forgotten.\nThere had always been present with him when he thought of Mary Bonner\na sort of remembrance of the hour in which he had played the fool\nwith dear Clary. He had kissed her. Well; yes; and with some girls\nkisses mean so much,--as Polly Neefit had said to her true lover. But\nthen with others they mean just nothing. \"If you want to find a wife\nin this house you had better ask her. It is certainly useless that\nyou should ask me.\"\n\n\"Do you mean quite useless?\" asked Ralph, beginning to be somewhat\nabashed.\n\n\"Absolutely useless. Did I not tell you something else,--something\nthat I would not have hinted to you, had it not been that I desired\nto prevent the possibility of a renewal of anything so vain? But you\nthink nothing of that! All that can be changed with you at a moment,\nif other things suit.\"\n\n\"That is meant to be severe, Miss Bonner, and I have not deserved it\nfrom you. What has brought me to you but that I admire you above all\nothers?\"\n\n\"You shouldn't admire me above others. Is a man to change as he likes\nbecause he sees a girl whose hair pleases him for the moment better\nthan does hers to whom he has sworn to be true?\" Ralph did not forget\nat this moment to whisper to himself for his own consolation, that\nhe had never sworn to be true to Clarissa. And, indeed, he did feel,\nthat though there had been a kiss, the scene on the lawn was being\nused unfairly to his prejudice. \"I am afraid you are very fickle, Mr.\nNewton, and that your love is not worth much.\"\n\n\"I hope we may both live till you learn that you have wronged me.\"\n\n\"I hope so. If my opinion be worth anything with you, go back to her\nfrom whom you have allowed yourself to stray in your folly. To me you\nmust not address yourself again. If you do, it will be an insult.\"\nThen she rose up, queenly in her beauty, and slowly left the room.\n\nThere must be an end of that. Such was Ralph's feeling as she\nleft the room, in spite of those protestations of constancy and\npersistence which he had made to himself. \"A fellow has to go on with\nit, and be refused half a dozen times by one of those proud ones,\" he\nhad said; \"but when they do knuckle under, they go in harness better\nthan the others.\" It was thus that he had thought of Mary Bonner, but\nhe did not so think of her now. No, indeed. There was an end of that.\n\"There is a sort of way of doing it, which shows that they mean it.\"\nSuch was his inward speech; and he did believe that Miss Bonner meant\nit. \"By Jove, yes; if words and looks ever can mean anything.\" But\nhow about Clarissa? If it was so, as Mary Bonner had told him, would\nit be the proper kind of thing for him to go back to Clarissa? His\nheart, too,--for he had a heart,--was very soft. He had always been\nfond of Clarissa, and would not, for worlds, that she should be\nunhappy. How pretty she was, and how soft, and how loving! And how\nproudly happy she would be to be driven about the Newton grounds by\nhim as their mistress. Then he remembered what Gregory had said to\nhim, and how he had encouraged Gregory to persevere. If anything of\nthat kind were to happen, Gregory must put up with it. It was clear\nthat Clarissa couldn't marry Gregory if she were in love with him.\nBut how would he look Sir Thomas in the face? As he thought of this\nhe laughed. Sir Thomas, however, would be glad enough to give his\ndaughter, not to the heir but to the owner of Newton. Who could be\nthat fellow whom Mary Bonner preferred to him--with all Newton to\nback his suit? Perhaps Mary Bonner did not know the meaning of being\nthe mistress of Newton Priory.\n\nAfter a while the servant came to show him to his chamber. Sir Thomas\nhad come and had gone at once to his room. So he went up-stairs and\ndressed, expecting to see Clarissa when they all assembled before\ndinner. When he went down, Sir Thomas was there, and Mary, and\nPatience,--but not Clarissa. He had summoned back his courage and\nspoke jauntily to Sir Thomas. Then he turned to Patience and asked\nafter her sister. \"Clarissa is spending the day with Mrs. Brownlow,\"\nsaid Patience, \"and will not be home till quite late.\"\n\n\"Oh, how unfortunate!\" exclaimed Ralph. Taking all his difficulties\ninto consideration, we must admit that he did not do it badly.\n\nAfter dinner Sir Thomas sat longer over his wine than is at present\nusual, believing, perhaps, that the young ladies would not want to\nsee much more of Ralph on the present occasion. The conversation was\nalmost entirely devoted to the affairs of the late election, as to\nwhich Ralph was much interested and very indignant. \"They cannot do\nyou any harm, sir, by the investigation,\" he said.\n\n\"No; I don't think they can hurt me.\"\n\n\"And you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you have been the\nmeans of exposing corruption, and of helping to turn such a man as\nGriffenbottom out of the House. Upon my word, I think it has been\nworth while.\"\n\n\"I am not sure that I would do it again at the same cost, and with\nthe same object,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\nRalph did have a cup of tea given to him in the drawing-room, and\nthen left the villa before Clarissa's fly had returned.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\n\nMR. MOGGS WALKS TOWARDS EDGEWARE.\n\n\nThe judge's decision in Percycross as to the late election was no\nsooner known than fresh overtures were made to Ontario Moggs by the\nYoung Men's Association. A letter of triumph was addressed to him at\nthe Cheshire Cheese, in which he was informed that Intimidation and\nCorruption had been trodden under foot in the infamous person of Mr.\nGriffenbottom, and that Purity and the Rights of Labour were still\nthe watchwords of that wholesome party in the borough which was\ndetermined to send Mr. Moggs to Parliament. Did not Mr. Moggs think\nit best that he should come down at once to the borough and look\nafter his interests? Now Mr. Moggs junior, when he received this\nletter, had left the borough no more than three or four days since,\nhaving been summoned there as a witness during the trial of the\npetition;--and such continued attendance to the political interests\nof a small and otherwise uninteresting town, without the advantage of\na seat in Parliament, was felt by Mr. Moggs senior to be a nuisance.\nThe expense in all these matters fell of course upon the shoulders\nof the father. \"I don't believe in them humbugs no longer,\" said Mr.\nMoggs senior. Moggs junior, who had felt the enthusiasm of the young\nmen of Percycross, and who had more to get and less to lose than his\nfather, did believe. Although he had been so lately at Percycross,\nhe went down again, and again made speeches to the young men at the\nMechanics' Institute. Nothing could be more triumphant than his\nspeeches, nothing more pleasant than his popularity; but he could\nnot fail to become aware, after a further sojourn of three days at\nPercycross, of two things. The first was this,--that if the borough\nwere spared there would be a compromise between the leading men on\nthe two sides, and Mr. Westmacott would be returned together with a\nyoung Griffenbottom. The second conviction forced upon him was that\nthe borough would not be spared. There was no comfort for him at\nPercycross,--other than what arose from a pure political conscience.\nOn the very morning on which he left, he besought his friends, the\nyoung men,--though they were about to be punished, degraded, and\ndisfranchised for the sins of their elders, though it might never be\nallowed to them again to stir themselves for the political welfare\nof their own borough,--still to remember that Purity and the Rights\nof Labour were the two great wants of the world, and that no man\ncould make an effort, however humble, in a good cause without doing\nsomething towards bringing nearer to him that millennium of political\nvirtue which was so much wanted, and which would certainly come\nsooner or later. He was cheered to the echo, and almost carried down\nto the station on the shoulders of a chairman, or president, and\na secretary; but he left Percycross with the conviction that that\nborough would never confer upon him the coveted honour of a seat in\nParliament.\n\nAll this had happened early in March, previous to that Sunday on\nwhich Mr. Neefit behaved so rudely to him at the cottage. \"I think as\nperhaps you'd better stick to business now a bit,\" said old Moggs. At\nthat moment Ontario was sitting up at a high desk behind the ledger\nwhich he hated, and was sticking to business as well as he knew how\nto stick to it. \"No more Cheshire Cheeses, if you please, young man,\"\nsaid the father. This was felt by the son to be unfair, cruel, and\neven corrupt. While the election was going on, as long as there was\na hope of success at Percycross, Moggs senior had connived at the\nCheshire Cheese, had said little or nothing about business, had even\nconsented on one occasion to hear his son make a speech advocating\nthe propriety of combination among workmen. \"It ain't my way of\nthinking,\" Moggs senior had said; \"but then, perhaps, I'm old.\" To\nhave had a member of the firm in Parliament would have been glorious\neven to old Moggs, though he hardly knew in what the glory would have\nconsisted. But as soon as he found that his hopes were vain, that the\nCheshire Cheese had been no stepping-stone to such honour, and that\nhis money had been spent for nothing, his mind reverted to its old\nform. Strikes became to him the work of the devil, and unions were\nonce more the bane of trade.\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Ontario, looking up from his ledger, \"if I work for\nmy bread by day, I may do as I please with my evenings. At any rate\nI shall,\" he continued to say after pausing awhile. \"It's best we\nshould understand each other, father.\" Moggs senior growled. At a\nword his son would have been off from him, rushing about the country,\nstriving to earn a crust as a political lecturer. Moggs knew his son\nwell, and in truth loved him dearly. There was, too, a Miss Moggs\nat home, who would give her father no peace if Ontario were turned\nadrift. There is nothing in the world so cruel as the way in which\nsons use the natural affections of their fathers, obtaining from\nthese very feelings a power of rebelling against authority! \"You must\ngo to the devil if you please, I suppose,\" said Moggs senior.\n\n\"I don't know why you say that. What do I do devilish?\"\n\n\"Them Unions is devilish.\"\n\n\"I think they're Godlike,\" said Moggs junior. After that they were\nsilent for a while, during which Moggs senior was cutting his nails\nwith a shoemaker's knife by the fading light of the evening, and\nMoggs junior was summing up an account against a favoured aristocrat,\nwho seemed to have worn a great many boots, but who was noticeable to\nOntario, chiefly from the fact that he represented in Parliament the\ndivision of the county in which Percycross was situated. \"I thought\nyou was going to make it all straight by marrying that girl,\" said\nMoggs senior.\n\nHere was a subject on which the father and the son were in\nunison;--and as to which the romantic heart of Miss Moggs, at home at\nShepherd's Bush, always glowed with enthusiasm. That her brother was\nin love, was to her, of whom in truth it must be owned that she was\nvery plain, the charm of her life. She was fond of poetry, and would\nread to her brother aloud the story of Juan and Haidee, and the\nmelancholy condition of the lady who was loved by the veiled prophet.\nShe sympathised with the false Queen's passion for Launcelot, and,\nbeing herself in truth an ugly old maid very far removed from things\nromantic, delighted in the affairs of the heart when they did not run\nsmooth. \"O Ontario,\" she would say, \"be true to her;--if it's for\ntwenty years.\" \"So I will;--but I'd like to begin the twenty years\nby making her Mrs. Moggs,\" said Ontario. Now Mr. Moggs senior knew\nto a penny what money old Neefit could give his daughter, and placed\nnot the slightest trust in that threat about the smock in which she\nstood upright. Polly would certainly get the better of her father as\nOntario always got the better of him. Ontario made no immediate reply\nto his father, but he found himself getting all wrong among the boots\nand shoes which had been supplied to that aristocratic young member\nof Parliament. \"You don't mean as it's all off?\" asked Moggs senior.\n\n\"No; it isn't all off.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you go in at it?\"\n\n\"Why don't I go in at it?\" said Ontario, closing the book in hopeless\nconfusion of mind and figures. \"I'd give every pair of boots in this\nplace, I'd give all the business, to get a kind word from her.\"\n\n\"Isn't she kind?\"\n\n\"Kind;--yes, she's kind enough in a way. She's everything just\nwhat she ought to be. That's what she is. Don't you go on about it,\nfather. I'm as much in earnest as you can be. I shan't give it up\ntill she calls somebody else her husband; and then,--; why then\nI shall just cut it, and go off to uncle in Canada. I've got my\nmind made up about all that.\" And so he left the shop, somewhat\nuncourteously perhaps. But he had worked his way back into his\nfather's good graces by his determination to stick to Neefit's girl.\nA young man ought to be allowed to attend trades' unions, or any\nother meetings, if he will marry a girl with twenty thousand pounds.\nThat evening Ontario Moggs went to the Cheshire Cheese, and was\ngreater than ever.\n\nIt has been already told how, on a Sunday subsequent to this, he\nmanaged to have himself almost closeted with Polly, and how he was\nworking himself into her good graces, when he was disturbed by Mr.\nNeefit and turned out of the house. Polly's heart had been yielding\nduring the whole of that interview. There had come upon her once a\ndream that it would be a fine thing to be the lady of Newton;--and\nthe chance had been hers. But when she set herself to work to\nweigh it all, and to find out what it was that young Newton really\nwanted,--and what he ought to want, she shook off from herself that\ndream before it had done her any injury. She meant to be married\ncertainly. As to that she had no doubt. But then Ontario Moggs was\nsuch a long-legged, awkward, ugly, shambling fellow, and Moggs as\na name was certainly not euphonious. The gasfitter was handsome,\nand was called Yallolegs, which perhaps was better than Moggs. He\nhad proposed to her more than once; but the gasfitter's face meant\nnothing, and the gasfitter himself hadn't much meaning in him. As to\noutside appearance, young Newton's was just what he ought to be,--but\nthat was a dream which she had shaken off. Onty Moggs had some\nmeaning in him, and was a man. If there was one thing, too, under the\nsun of which Polly was quite sure, it was this,--that Onty Moggs did\nreally love her. She knew that in the heart, and mind, and eyes of\nOnty Moggs she possessed a divinity which made the ground she stood\nupon holy ground for him. Now that is a conviction very pleasant to a\nyoung woman.\n\nOntario was very near his victory on that Sunday. When he told her\nthat he would compass the death of Ralph Newton if Ralph Newton was\nto cause her to break her heart, she believed that he would do it,\nand she felt obliged to him,--although she laughed at him. When he\ndeclared to her that he didn't know what to do because of his love,\nshe was near to telling him what he might do. When he told her that\nhe would sooner have a kiss from her than be Prime Minister, she\nbelieved him, and almost longed to make him happy. Then she had\ntripped, giving him encouragement which she did not intend,--and had\nretreated, telling him that he was silly. But as she said so she made\nup her mind that he should be perplexed not much longer. After all,\nin spite of his ugliness, and awkwardness, and long legs, this was\nto be her man. She recognised the fact, and was happy. It is so much\nfor a girl to be sure that she is really loved! And there was no word\nwhich fell from Ontario's mouth which Polly did not believe. Ralph\nNewton's speeches were very pretty, but they conveyed no more than\nhis intention to be civil. Ontario's speeches really brought home to\nher all that the words could mean. When he told her father that he\nwas quite contented to take her just as she was, without a shilling,\nshe knew that he would do so with the utmost joy. Then it was that\nshe resolved that he should have her, and that for the future all\ndoubtings, all flirtations, all coyness, should be over. She had been\nwon, and she lowered her flag. \"You stick to it, and you'll do it,\"\nshe said;--and this time she meant it. \"I shall,\" said Ontario;--and\nhe walked all the way back to London, with his head among the clouds,\ndisregarding Percycross utterly, forgetful of all the boots and\naristocrats' accounts, regardless almost of the Cheshire Cheese, not\neven meditating a new speech in defence of the Rights of Labour. He\nbelieved that on that day he had gained the great victory. If so,\nlife before him was one vista of triumph. That he himself was what\nthe world calls romantic, he had no idea,--but he had lived now for\nmonths on the conviction that the only chance of personal happiness\nto himself was to come from the smiles and kindness and love of a\ncertain human being whom he had chosen to beatify. To him Polly\nNeefit was divine, and round him also there would be a halo of\ndivinity if this goddess would consent to say that she would become\nhis wife.\n\nIt was impossible that many days should be allowed to pass before he\nmade an effort to learn from her own lips, positively, the meaning\nof those last words which she had spoken to him. But there was\na difficulty. Neefit had warned him from the house, and he felt\nunwilling to knock at the door of a man in that man's absence, who,\nif present, would have refused to him the privilege of admittance.\nThat Mrs. Neefit would see him, and afford him opportunity of\npleading his cause with Polly, he did not doubt;--but some idea that\na man's house, being his castle, should not be invaded in the owner's\nabsence, restrained him. That the man's daughter might be the dearer\nand the choicer, and the more sacred castle of the two, was true\nenough; but then Polly was a castle which, as Moggs thought, ought to\nbelong to him rather than to her father. And so he resolved to waylay\nPolly.\n\nHis weekdays, from nine in the morning till seven in the evening,\nwere at this time due to Booby and Moggs, and he was at present\npaying that debt religiously, under a conviction that his various\nabsences at Percycross had been hard upon his father. For there was,\nin truth, no Booby. Moggs senior, and Moggs junior, constituted the\nwhole firm;--in which, indeed, up to this moment Moggs junior had no\nrecognised share,--and if one was absent, the other must be present.\nBut Sunday was his own, and Polly Neefit always went to church.\nNevertheless, on the first Sunday he failed. He failed, though he saw\nher, walking with two other ladies, and though, to the best of his\njudgment, she also saw him. On the second Sunday he was at Hendon\nfrom ten till three, hanging about in the lanes, sitting on gates,\nwhiling away the time with a treatise on political economy which he\nhad brought down in his pocket, thinking of Polly while he strove\nto confine his thoughts to the great subject of man's productive\nindustry. Is there any law of Nature,--law of God, rather,--by which\na man has a right to enough of food, enough of raiment, enough of\nshelter, and enough of recreation, if only he will work? But Polly's\ncheeks, and Polly's lips, the eager fire of Polly's eye as she would\nspeak, and all the elastic beauty of Polly's gait as she would walk,\ndrove the great question from his mind. Was he ever destined to hold\nPolly in his arms,--close, close to his breast? If not, then the laws\nof Nature and the laws of God, let them be what they might, would not\nhave been sufficient to protect him from the cruellest wrong of all.\n\nIt was as she went to afternoon church that he hoped to intercept\nher. Morning church with many is a bond. Afternoon church is a virtue\nof supererogation,--practised often because there is nothing else to\ndo. It would be out of the question that he should induce her to give\nup the morning service; but if he could only come upon her in the\nafternoon, a little out of sight of others, just as she would turn\ndown a lane with which he was acquainted, near to a stile leading\nacross the fields towards Edgeware, it might be possible that he\nshould prevail. As the hour came near, he put the useless volume into\nhis pocket, and stationed himself on the spot which he had selected.\nAlmost at the first moment in which he had ventured to hope for her\npresence, Polly turned into the lane. It was six months after this\noccurrence that she confessed to him that she had thought it just\npossible that he might be there. \"Of course you would be there,--you\nold goose; as if Jemima hadn't told me that you'd been about all day.\nBut I never should have come, if I hadn't quite made up my mind.\"\nThen Ontario administered to her one of those bear's hugs which were\nwont to make Polly declare that he was an ogre. It was thus that\nPolly made her confession after the six months, as they were sitting\nvery close to each other on some remote point of the cliffs down\non the Kentish coast. At that time the castle had been altogether\ntransferred out of the keeping of Mr. Neefit.\n\nBut Polly's conduct on this occasion was not at all of a nature to\nmake it supposed that Jemima's eyes had been so sharp. \"What, Mr.\nMoggs!\" she said. \"Dear me, what a place to find you in! Are you\ncoming to church?\"\n\n\"I want you just to take a turn with me for a few minutes, Polly.\"\n\n\"But I'm going to church.\"\n\n\"You can go to church afterwards;--that is, if you like. I can't come\nto the house now, and I have got something that I must say to you.\"\n\n\"Something that you must say to me!\" And then Polly followed him over\nthe stile.\n\nThey had walked the length of nearly two fields before Ontario had\ncommenced to tell the tale which of necessity must be told; but\nPolly, though she must have known that her chances of getting back to\nchurch were becoming more and more remote, waited without impatience.\n\"I want to know,\" he said, at last, \"whether you can ever learn to\nlove me.\"\n\n\"What's the use, Mr. Moggs?\"\n\n\"It will be all the use in the world to me.\"\n\n\"Oh, no it won't. It can't signify so very much to anybody.\"\n\n\"Nothing, I sometimes think, can ever be of any use to me but that.\"\n\n\"As for learning to love a man,--I suppose I could love a man without\nany learning if I liked him.\"\n\n\"But you don't like me, Polly?\"\n\n\"I never said I didn't like you. Father and mother always used to\nlike you.\"\n\n\"But you, Polly?\"\n\n\"Oh, I like you well enough. Don't, Mr. Moggs.\"\n\n\"But do you love me?\" Then there was a pause, as they stood leaning\nupon a gateway. \"Come, Polly; tell a fellow. Do you love me?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" Then there was another pause; but he was in a seventh\nheaven, with his arm round her waist. \"I suppose I do; a little,\"\nwhispered Polly.\n\n\"But better than anybody else?\"\n\n\"You don't think I mean to have two lovers;--do you?\"\n\n\"And I am to be your lover?\"\n\n\"There's father, you know. I'm not going to be anybody's wife because\nhe tells me; but I wouldn't like to vex him, if we could help it.\"\n\n\"But you'll never belong to any one else?\"\n\n\"Never,\" said she solemnly.\n\n\"Then I've said what I've got to say, and I'm the happiest man in all\nthe world, and you may go to church now if you like.\" But his arm was\nstill tight round her waist.\n\n\"It's too late,\" said Polly, in a melancholy tone,--\"and it's all\nyour doing.\"\n\nThe walk was prolonged not quite to Edgeware; but so far that Mr.\nNeefit was called upon to remark that the parson was preaching a very\nlong sermon. Mrs. Neefit, who perhaps had also had communication\nwith Jemima, remarked that it was not to be expected, but that Polly\nshould take a ramble with some of her friends. \"Why can't she ramble\nwhere I want her to ramble?\" said Mr. Neefit.\n\nMany things were settled during that walk. Within five minutes of\nthe time in which she had declared that it was too late for her\nto go to church, she had brought herself to talk to him with all\nthe delightful confidence of a completed engagement. She made him\nunderstand at once that there was no longer any doubt. \"A girl must\nhave time to know,\" she said, when he half-reproached her with the\ndelay. A girl wasn't like a man, she said, who could just make up his\nmind at once,--a girl had to wait and see. But she was quite sure of\nthis,--that having once said the word she would never go back from\nit. She didn't quite know when she had first begun to love him, but\nshe thought it was when she heard that he had made up his mind to\nstand for Percycross. It seemed to her to be such a fine thing,--his\ngoing to Percycross. \"Then,\" said Ontario, gallantly, \"Percycross has\ndone ten times more for me than it would have done, had it simply\nmade me a member of Parliament.\" Once, twice, and oftener he was\nmade happier than he could have been had fortune made him a Prime\nMinister. For Polly, now that she had given her heart and promised\nher hand, would not coy her lips to the man she had chosen.\n\nMany things were settled between them. Polly told her lover all her\ntrouble about Ralph Newton, and it was now that she received that\nadvice from her \"very particular friend, Mr. Moggs,\" which she\nfollowed in writing to her late suitor. The letter was to be written\nand posted that afternoon, and then shown to her father. We know\nalready that in making the copy for her father she omitted one\nclause,--having resolved that she would tell her mother of her\nengagement, and that her mother should communicate it to her father.\nAs for naming any day for their marriage, \"That was out of the\nquestion,\" she said. She did not wish to delay it; but all that\nshe could do was to swear to her father that she would never marry\nanybody else. \"And he'll believe me too,\" said Polly. As for eloping,\nshe would not hear of it. \"Just that he might have an excuse to give\nhis money to somebody else,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't care for his money,\" protested Moggs.\n\n\"That's all very well; but money's a good thing in its way. I hate a\nman who'd sell himself; he's a mean fellow;--or a girl either. Money\nshould never be first. But as for pitching it away just because\nyou're in a hurry, I don't believe in that at all. I'm not going\nto be an old woman yet, and you may wait a few months very well.\"\nShe walked with him direct up to the gate leading up to their own\nhouse,--so that all the world might see her, if all the world\npleased; and then she bade him good-bye. \"Some day before very long,\nno doubt,\" she said when, as he left her, he asked as to their next\nmeeting.\n\nAnd so Polly had engaged herself. I do not know that the matter\nseemed to her to be of so much importance as it does to many girls.\nIt was a piece of business which had to be done some day, as she had\nwell known for years past; and now that it was done, she was quite\ncontented with the doing of it. But there was not much of that\necstasy in her bosom which was at the present moment sending Ontario\nMoggs bounding up to town, talking, as he went, to himself,--to the\namazement of passers by, and assuring himself that he had triumphed\nlike an Alexander or a C\u00c3\u00a6sar. She made some steady resolves to do her\nduty by him, and told herself again and again that nothing should\never move her now that she had decided. As for beauty in a man;--what\ndid it signify? He was honest. As for awkwardness;--what did it\nmatter? He was clever. And in regard to being a gentleman; she rather\nthought that she liked him better because he wasn't exactly what some\npeople call a gentleman. Whatever sort of a home he would give her\nto live in, nobody would despise her in it because she was not grand\nenough for her place. She was by no means sure that a good deal of\nmisery of that kind might not have fallen to her lot had she become\nthe mistress of Newton Priory. \"When the beggar woman became a queen,\nhow the servants must have snubbed her,\" said Polly to herself.\n\nThat evening she showed her letter to her father. \"You haven't sent\nit, you minx?\" said he.\n\n\"Yes, father. It's in the iron box.\"\n\n\"What business had you to write to a young man?\"\n\n\"Come, father. I had a business.\"\n\n\"I believe you want to break my heart,\" said old Neefit.\n\nThat evening her mother asked her what she had been doing that\nafternoon. \"I just took a walk with Ontario Moggs,\" said Polly.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"And I've just engaged myself straight off, and you had better tell\nfather. I mean to keep to it, mother, let anybody say anything. I\nwouldn't go back from my promise if they were to drag me. So father\nmay as well know at once.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX.\n\nAMONG THE PICTURES.\n\n\nNorfolk is a county by no means devoted to hunting, and Ralph\nNewton,--the disinherited Ralph as we may call him,--had been\nadvised by some of his friends round Newton to pitch his tent\nelsewhere,--because of his love of that sport. \"You'll get a bit of\nland just as cheap in the shires,\" Morris had said to him. \"And, if\nI were you, I wouldn't go among a set of fellows who don't think of\nanything in the world except partridges.\" Mr. Morris, who was a very\ngood fellow in his way, devoted a considerable portion of his mental\nand physical energies to the birth, rearing, education, preservation,\nand subsequent use of the fox,--thinking that in so doing he employed\nhimself nobly as a country gentleman; but he thoroughly despised a\ncounty in which partridges were worshipped.\n\n\"They do preserve foxes,\" pleaded Ralph.\n\n\"One man does, and the next don't. You ought to know what that means.\nIt's the most heart-breaking kind of thing in the world. I'd sooner\nbe without foxes altogether, and ride to a drag;--I would indeed.\"\nThis assertion Mr. Morris made in a sadly solemn tone, such as men\nuse when they speak of some adversity which fate and fortune may be\npreparing for them. \"I'd a deal rather die than bear it,\" says the\nmelancholy friend; or,--\"I'd much sooner put up with a crust in a\ncorner.\" \"I'd rather ride to a drag;--I would indeed,\" said Mr.\nMorris, with a shake of the head, and a low sigh. As for life without\nriding to hounds at all, Mr. Morris did not for a moment suppose that\nhis friend contemplated such an existence.\n\nBut Ralph had made up his mind that, in going out into the world to\ndo something, foxes should not be his first object. He had to seek\na home certainly, but more important than his home was the work to\nwhich he should give himself; and, as he had once said, he knew\nnothing useful that he could do except till the land. So he went\ndown into Norfolk among the intermittent fox preservers, and took\nBeamingham Hall.\n\nAlmost every place in Norfolk is a \"ham,\" and almost every house is\na hall. There was a parish of Beamingham, four miles from Swaffham,\nlying between Tillham, Soham, Reepham, and Grindham. It's down in\nall the maps. It's as flat as a pancake; it has a church with a\nmagnificent square tower, and a new chancel; there is a resident\nparson, and there are four or five farmers in it; it is under the\nplough throughout, and is famous for its turnips; half the parish\nbelongs to a big lord, who lives in the county, and who does preserve\nfoxes, but not with all his heart; two other farms are owned by the\nyeomen who farm them,--men who have been brought up to shoot, and who\nhate the very name of hunting. Beamingham Hall was to be sold, and by\nthe beginning of May Ralph Newton had bought it. Beamingham Little\nWood belonged to the estate, and, as it contained about thirty acres,\nRalph determined that he would endeavour to have a fox there.\n\nBy the middle of May he had been four months in his new home. The\nhouse itself was not bad. It was spacious; and the rooms, though\nlow, were large. And it had been built with considerable idea\nof architectural beauty. The windows were all set in stone and\nmullioned,--long, low windows, very beautiful in form, which had till\nsome fifteen years back been filled with a multitude of small diamond\npanes;--but now the diamond panes had given way to plate glass. There\nwere three gables to the hall, all facing an old-fashioned large\ngarden, in which the fruit trees came close up to the house, and\nthat which perhaps ought to have been a lawn was almost an orchard.\nBut there were trim gravel walks, and trim flower-beds, and a trim\nfish-pond, and a small walled kitchen-garden, with very old peaches,\nand very old apricots, and very old plums. The plums, however, were\nat present better than the peaches or the apricots. The fault of the\nhouse, as a modern residence, consisted in this,--that the farm-yard,\nwith all its appurtenances, was very close to the back door. Ralph\ntold himself when he first saw it that Mary Bonner would never\nconsent to live in a house so placed.\n\nFor whom was such a house as Beamingham Hall originally built,--a\nhouse not grand enough for a squire's mansion, and too large for a\nfarmer's homestead? Such houses throughout England are much more\nnumerous than Englishmen think,--either still in good repair, as was\nBeamingham Hall, or going into decay under the lessened domestic\nwants of the present holders. It is especially so in the eastern\ncounties, and may be taken as one proof among many that the\nbroad-acred squire, with his throng of tenants, is comparatively a\nmodern invention. The country gentleman of two hundred years ago\nfarmed the land he held. As years have rolled on, the strong have\nswallowed the weak,--one strong man having eaten up half-a-dozen weak\nmen. And so the squire has been made. Then the strong squire becomes\na baronet and a lord,--till he lords it a little too much, and a\nManchester warehouseman buys him out. The strength of the country\nprobably lies in the fact that the change is ever being made, but is\nnever made suddenly.\n\nTo Ralph the great objection to Beamingham Hall lay in that fear,--or\nrather certainty,--that it could not be made a fitting home for Mary\nBonner. When he first decided on taking it, and even when he decided\non buying it, he assured himself that Mary Bonner's taste might be\nquite indifferent to him. In the first place, he had himself written\nto her uncle to withdraw his claim as soon as he found that Newton\nwould never belong to him; and then he had been told by the happy\nowner of Newton that Mary was still to be asked to share the throne\nof that principality. When so told he had said nothing of his\nown ambition, but had felt that there was another reason why he\nshould leave Newton and its neighbourhood. For him, as a bachelor,\nBeamingham Hall would be only too good a house. He, as a farmer, did\nnot mean to be ashamed of his own dunghill.\n\nBy the middle of May he had heard nothing either of his namesake\nor of Mary Bonner. He did correspond with Gregory Newton, and thus\nreceived tidings of the parish, of the church, of the horses,--and\neven of the foxes; but of the heir's matrimonial intentions he heard\nnothing. Gregory did write of his own visits to the metropolis, past\nand future, and Ralph knew that the young parson would again singe\nhis wings in the flames that were burning at Popham Villa; but\nnothing was said of the heir. Through March and April that trouble\nrespecting Polly Neefit was continued, and Gregory in his letter of\ncourse did not speak of the Neefits. At last May was come, and Ralph\nfrom Beamingham made up his mind that he also would go up to London.\nHe had been hard at work during the last four months doing all those\nwonderfully attractive things with his new property which a man can\ndo when he has money in his pocket,--knocking down hedges, planting\nyoung trees or preparing for the planting of them, buying stock,\nbuilding or preparing to build sheds,--and the rest of it. There is\nhardly a pleasure in life equal to that of laying out money with a\nconviction that it will come back again. The conviction, alas, is\nso often ill founded,--but the pleasure is the same. In regard to\nthe house itself he would do nothing, not even form a plan--as yet.\nIt might be possible that some taste other than his own should be\nconsulted.\n\nIn the second week in May he went up to London, having heard that\nGregory would be there at the same time; and he at once found himself\nconsorting with his namesake almost as much as with the parson. It\nwas now a month since the heir had been dismissed from Popham Villa,\nand he had not since that date renewed his visit. Nor from that day\nto the present had he seen Sir Thomas. It cannot be said with exact\ntruth that he was afraid of Sir Thomas or ashamed to see the girls.\nHe had no idea that he had behaved badly to anybody; and, if he\nhad, he was almost disposed to make amends for such sin by marrying\nClarissa; but he felt that should he ultimately make up his mind in\nClarissa's favour, a little time should elapse for the gradual cure\nof his former passion. No doubt he placed reliance on his position\nas a man of property, feeling that by his strength in that direction\nhe would be pulled through all his little difficulties; but it was\nan unconscious reliance. He believed that he was perfectly free\nfrom what he himself would have called the dirt and littleness of\npurse-pride--or acre-pride, and would on some occasions assert that\nhe really thought nothing of himself because he was Newton of Newton.\nAnd he meant to be true. Nevertheless, in the bottom of his heart,\nthere was a confidence that he might do this and that because of his\nacres, and among the things which might be thus done, but which could\nnot otherwise have been done, was this return to Clarissa after his\nlittle lapse in regard to Mary Bonner.\n\nHe was delighted to welcome Ralph from Norfolk to all the pleasures\nof the metropolis. Should he put down Ralph's name at the famous\nCarlton, of which he had lately become a member? Ralph already\nbelonged to an old-fashioned club, of which his father had been long\na member, and declined the new honour. As for balls, evening crushes,\nand large dinner-parties, our Norfolk Ralph thought himself to be\nunsuited for them just at present, because of his father's death. It\nwas not for the nephew of the dead man to tell the son that eight\nmonths of mourning for a father was more than the world now required.\nHe could only take the excuse, and suggest the play, and a little\ndinner at Richmond, and a small party to Maidenhead as compromises.\n\"I don't know that there is any good in a fellow being so heavy in\nhand because his father is dead,\" the Squire said to his brother.\n\n\"They were so much to each other,\" pleaded Gregory in return. The\nSquire accepted the excuse, and offered his namesake a horse for the\npark. Would he make one of the party for the moors in August? The\nSquire asserted that he had room for another gun, without entailing\nany additional expense upon himself. This indeed was not strictly\ntrue, as it had been arranged that the cost should be paid per\ngun; but there was a vacancy still, and Ralph the heir, being\nquite willing to pay for his cousin, thought no harm to cover his\ngenerosity under a venial falsehood. The disinherited one, however,\ndeclined the offer, with many thanks. \"There is nothing, old fellow,\nI wouldn't do for you, if I knew how,\" said the happy heir. Whereupon\nthe Norfolk Ralph unconsciously resolved that he would accept\nnothing,--or as little as possible,--at the hands of the Squire.\n\nAll this happened during the three or four first days of his sojourn\nin London, in which, he hardly knew why, he had gone neither to the\nvilla nor to Sir Thomas in Southampton Buildings. He meant to do so,\nbut from day to day he put it off. As regarded the ladies at the\nvilla the three young men now never spoke to each other respecting\nthem. Gregory believed that his brother had failed, and so believing\ndid not recur to the subject. Gregory himself had already been at\nFulham once or twice since his arrival in town; but had nothing\nto say,--or at least did say nothing,--of what happened there. He\nintended to remain away from his parish for no more than the parson's\nnormal thirteen days, and was by no means sure that he would make any\nfurther formal offer. When at the villa he found that Clarissa was\nsad and sober, and almost silent; and he knew that something was\nwrong. It hardly occurred to him to believe that after all he might\nperhaps cure the evil.\n\nOne morning, early, Gregory and Ralph from Norfolk were together at\nthe Royal Academy. Although it was not yet ten when they entered the\ngallery, the rooms were already so crowded that it was difficult to\nget near the line, and almost impossible either to get into or to\nget out of a corner. Gregory had been there before, and knew the\npictures. He also was supposed by his friends to understand something\nof the subject; whereas Ralph did not know a Cooke from a Hook, and\npossessed no more than a dim idea that Landseer painted all the wild\nbeasts, and Millais all the little children. \"That's a fine picture,\"\nhe said, pointing up at an enormous portrait of the Master of the B.\nB., in a red coat, seated square on a seventeen-hand high horse, with\nhis hat off, and the favourite hounds of his pack around him. \"That's\nby Grant,\" said Gregory. \"I don't know that I care for that kind of\nthing.\" \"It's as like as it can stare,\" said Ralph, who appreciated\nthe red coat, and the well-groomed horse, and the finely-shaped\nhounds. He backed a few steps to see the picture better, and found\nhimself encroaching upon a lady's dress. He turned round and found\nthat the lady was Mary Bonner. Together with her were both Clarissa\nand Patience Underwood.\n\nThe greetings between them all were pleasant, and the girls were\nunaffectedly pleased to find friends whom they knew well enough to\naccept as guides and monitors in the room. \"Now we shall be told all\nabout everything,\" said Clarissa, as the young parson shook hands\nfirst with her sister and then with her. \"Do take us round to the\nbest dozen, Mr. Newton. That's the way I like to begin.\" Her tone was\ncompletely different from what it had been down at the villa.\n\n\"That gentleman in the red coat is my cousin's favourite,\" said\nGregory.\n\n\"I don't care a bit about that.\" said Clarissa.\n\n\"That's because you don't hunt,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"I wish I hunted,\" said Mary Bonner.\n\nMary, when she first saw the man, of whom she had once been told that\nhe was to be her lover, and, when so told, had at least been proud\nthat she was so chosen,--felt that she was blushing slightly; but\nshe recovered herself instantly, and greeted him as though there\nhad been no cause whatever for disturbance. He was struck almost\ndumb at seeing her, and it was her tranquillity which restored him\nto composure. After the first greetings were over he found himself\nwalking by her side without any effort on her part to avoid him,\nwhile Gregory and the two sisters went on in advance. Poor Ralph had\nnot a word to say about the pictures. \"Have you been long in London?\"\nshe asked.\n\n\"Just four days.\"\n\n\"We heard that you were coming, and did think that perhaps you and\nyour cousin might find a morning to come down and see us;--your\ncousin Gregory, I mean.\"\n\n\"Of course I shall come.\"\n\n\"My uncle will be so glad to see you;--only, you know, you\ncan't always find him at home. And so will Patience. You are a\ngreat favourite with Patience. You have gone down to live in\nNorfolk,--haven't you?\"\n\n\"Yes--in Norfolk.\"\n\n\"You have bought an estate there?\"\n\n\"Just one farm that I look after myself. It's no estate, Miss\nBonner;--just a farm-house, with barns and stables, and a horse-pond,\nand the rest of it.\" This was by no means a fair account of the\nplace, but it suited him so to speak of it. \"My days for having an\nestate were quickly brought to a close;--were they not?\" This he said\nwith a little laugh, and then hated himself for having spoken so\nfoolishly.\n\n\"Does that make you unhappy, Mr. Newton?\" she asked. He did not\nanswer her at once, and she continued, \"I should have thought that\nyou were above being made unhappy by that.\"\n\n\"Such disappointments carry many things with them of which people\noutside see nothing.\"\n\n\"That is true, no doubt.\"\n\n\"A man may be separated from every friend he has in the world by such\na change of circumstances.\"\n\n\"I had not thought of that. I beg your pardon,\" said she, looking\ninto his face almost imploringly.\n\n\"And there may be worse than that,\" he said. Of course she knew what\nhe meant, but he did not know how much she knew. \"It is easy to say\nthat a man should stand up against reverses,--but there are some\nreverses a man cannot bear without suffering.\" She had quite made up\nher mind that the one reverse of which she was thinking should be\ncured; but she could take no prominent step towards curing it yet.\nBut that some step should be taken sooner or later she was resolved.\nIt might be taken now, indeed, if he would only speak out. But she\nquite understood that he would not speak out now because that house\ndown in Norfolk was no more than a farm. \"But I didn't mean to\ntrouble you with all that nonsense,\" he said.\n\n\"It doesn't trouble me at all. Of course you will tell us everything\nwhen you come to see us.\"\n\n\"There is very little to tell,--unless you care for cows and pigs,\nand sheep and horses.\"\n\n\"I do care for cows and pigs, and sheep and horses,\" she said.\n\n\"All the same, they are not pleasant subjects of conversation. A man\nmay do as much good with a single farm as he can with a large estate;\nbut he can't make his affairs as interesting to other people.\" There\nwas present to his own mind the knowledge that he and his rich\nnamesake were rivals in regard to the affections of this beautiful\ngirl, and he could not avoid allusions to his own inferiority. And\nyet his own words, as soon as they were spoken and had sounded in\nhis ear, were recognised by himself as being mean and pitiful,--as\nwhining words, and sorry plaints against the trick which fortune had\nplayed him. He did not know how to tell her boldly that he lamented\nthis change from the estate to the farm because he had hoped that\nshe would share the one with him, and did not dare even to ask her\nto share the other. She understood it all, down to the look of\ndispleasure which crossed his face as he felt the possible effect of\nhis own speech. She understood it all, but she could not give him\nmuch help,--as yet. There might perhaps come a moment in which she\ncould explain to him her own ideas about farms and estates, and the\nreasons in accordance with which these might be selected and those\nrejected. \"Have you seen much of Ralph Newton lately?\" asked the\nother Ralph.\n\n\"Of your cousin?\"\n\n\"Yes;--only I do not call him so. I have no right to call him my\ncousin.\"\n\n\"No; We do not see much of him.\" This was said in a tone of voice\nwhich ought to have sufficed for curing any anxiety in Ralph's bosom\nrespecting his rival. Had he not been sore and nervous, and, as it\nmust be admitted, almost stupid in the matter, he could not but have\ngathered from that tone that his namesake was at least no favourite\nwith Miss Bonner. \"He used to be a great deal at Popham Villa,\" said\nRalph.\n\n\"We do not see him often now. I fancy there has been some cause of\ndispleasure between him and my uncle. His brother has been with us\nonce or twice. I do like Mr. Gregory Newton.\"\n\n\"He is the best fellow that ever lived,\" exclaimed Ralph with energy.\n\n\"So much nicer than his brother,\" said Mary;--\"though perhaps I ought\nnot to say so to you.\"\n\nThis at any rate could not but be satisfactory to him. \"I like them\nboth,\" he said; \"but I love Greg dearly. He and I have lived together\nlike brothers for years, whereas it is only quite lately that I have\nknown the other.\"\n\n\"It is only lately that I have known either;--but they seem to me\nto be so different. Is not that a wonderfully beautiful picture, Mr.\nNewton? Can't, you almost fancy yourself sitting down and throwing\nstones into the river, or dabbling your feet in it?\"\n\n\"It is very pretty,\" said he, not caring a penny for the picture.\n\n\"Have you any river at Beamingham?\"\n\n\"There's a muddy little brook that you could almost jump over. You\nwouldn't want to dabble in that.\"\n\n\"Has it got a name?\"\n\n\"I think they call it the Wissey. It's not at all a river to be proud\nof,--except in the way of eels and water-rats.\"\n\n\"Is there nothing to be proud of at Beamingham?\"\n\n\"There's the church tower;--that's all.\"\n\n\"A church tower is something;--but I meant as to Beamingham Hall.\"\n\n\"That word Hall misleads people,\" said Ralph. \"It's a kind of\nupper-class farm-house with a lot of low rooms, and intricate\npassages, and chambers here and there, smelling of apples, and a huge\nkitchen, and an oven big enough for a small dinner-party.\"\n\n\"I should like the oven.\"\n\n\"And a laundry, and a dairy, and a cheese-house,--only we never make\nany cheese; and a horse-pond, and a dung-hill, and a cabbage-garden.\"\n\n\"Is that all you can say for your new purchase, Mr. Newton?\"\n\n\"The house itself isn't ugly.\"\n\n\"Come;--that's better.\"\n\n\"And it might be made fairly comfortable, if there were any use in\ndoing it.\"\n\n\"Of course there will be use.\"\n\n\"I don't know that there will,\" said Ralph. \"Sometimes I think one\nthing, and sometimes another. One week I'm full of a scheme about a\nnew garden and a conservatory, and a bow-window to the drawing-room;\nand then, the next week, I think that the two rooms I live in at\npresent will be enough for me.\"\n\n\"Stick to the conservatory, Mr. Newton. But here are the girls, and I\nsuppose it is about time for us to go.\"\n\n\"Mary, where have you been?\" said Clarissa.\n\n\"Looking at landscapes,\" said Mary.\n\n\"Mr. Newton has shown us every picture worth seeing, and described\neverything, and we haven't had to look at the catalogue once. That's\njust what I like at the Academy. I don't know whether you've been as\nlucky.\"\n\n\"I've had a great deal described to me too,\" said Mary; \"but I'm\nafraid we've forgotten the particular duty that brought us here.\"\nThen they parted, the two men promising that they would be at the\nvilla before long, and the girls preparing themselves for their\nreturn home.\n\n\"That cousin of theirs is certainly very beautiful,\" said Gregory,\nafter some short tribute to the merits of the two sisters.\n\n\"I think she is,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"I do not wonder that my brother has been struck with her.\"\n\n\"Nor do I.\" Then after a pause he continued; \"She said something\nwhich made me think that she and your brother haven't quite hit it\noff together.\"\n\n\"I don't know that they have,\" said Gregory. \"Ralph does change his\nmind sometimes. He hasn't said a word about her to me lately.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L.\n\nANOTHER FAILURE.\n\n\nThe day after the meeting at the Academy, as Ralph, the young Squire,\nwas sitting alone in his room over a late breakfast, a maid-servant\nbelonging to the house opened the door and introduced Mr. Neefit.\nIt was now the middle of May, and Ralph had seen nothing of the\nbreeches-maker since the morning on which he had made his appearance\nin the yard of the Moonbeam. There had been messages, and Mr. Carey\nhad been very busy endeavouring to persuade the father that he\ncould benefit neither himself nor his daughter by persistence in so\nextravagant a scheme. Money had been offered to Mr. Neefit,--most\nunfortunately, and this offer had added to his wrongs. And he had\nbeen told by his wife that Polly had at last decided in regard to her\nown affections, and had accepted her old lover, Mr. Moggs. He had\nraved at Polly to her face. He had sworn at Moggs behind his back. He\nhad called Mr. Carey very hard names;--and now he forced himself once\nmore upon the presence of the young Squire. \"Captain,\" he said, as\nsoon as he had carefully closed the door behind him, \"are you going\nto be upon the square?\" Newton had given special orders that Neefit\nshould not be admitted to his presence; but here he was, having made\nhis way into the chamber in the temporary absence of the Squire's own\nservant.\n\n\"Mr. Neefit,\" said Newton, \"I cannot allow this.\"\n\n\"Not allow it, Captain?\"\n\n\"No;--I cannot. I will not be persecuted. I have received favours\nfrom you--\"\n\n\"Yes, you have, Captain.\"\n\n\"And I will do anything in reason to repay them.\"\n\n\"Will you come out and see our Polly?\"\n\n\"No, I won't.\"\n\n\"You won't?\"\n\n\"Certainly not. I don't believe your daughter wants to see me. She\nis engaged to another man.\" So much Mr. Carey had learned from Mrs.\nNeefit. \"I have a great regard for your daughter, but I will not go\nto see her.\"\n\n\"Engaged to another man;--is she?\"\n\n\"I am told so.\"\n\n\"Oh;--that's your little game, is it? And you won't see me when I\ncall,--won't you? I won't stir out of this room unless you sends\nfor the police, and so we'll get it all into one of the courts of\nlaw. I shall just like to see how you'll look when you're being\ncross-hackled by one of them learned gents. There'll be a question or\ntwo about the old breeches-maker as the Squire of Newton mayn't like\nto see in the papers the next morning. I shall take the liberty of\nringing the bell and ordering a bit of dinner here, if you don't\nmind. I shan't go when the police comes without a deal of row, and\nthen we shall have it all out in the courts.\"\n\nThis was monstrously absurd, but at the same time very annoying.\nEven though he should disregard that threat of being \"cross-hackled\nby a learned gent,\" and of being afterwards made notorious in the\nnewspapers,--which it must be confessed he did not find himself able\nto disregard,--still, independently of that feeling, he was very\nunwilling to call for brute force to remove Mr. Neefit from the\narm-chair in which that worthy tradesman had seated himself. He\nhad treated the man otherwise than as a tradesman. He had borrowed\nthe man's money, and eaten the man's dinners; visited the man at\nRamsgate, and twice offered his hand to the man's daughter. \"You are\nvery welcome to dine here,\" he said, \"only I am sorry that I cannot\ndine here with you.\"\n\n\"I won't stir from the place for a week.\"\n\n\"That will be inconvenient,\" said Ralph,\n\n\"Uncommon inconvenient I should say, to a gent like you,--especially\nas I shall tell everybody that I'm on a visit to my son-in-law.\"\n\n\"I meant to yourself,--and to the business.\"\n\n\"Never you mind the business, Captain. There'll be enough left to\ngive my girl all the money I promised her, and I don't think I shall\nhave to ask you to keep your father-in-law neither. Sending an\nattorney to offer me a thousand pounds! It's my belief I could buy\nyou out yet, Captain, in regard to ready money.\"\n\n\"I daresay you could, Mr. Neefit.\"\n\n\"And I won't stir from here till you name a day to come and see me\nand my missus and Polly.\"\n\n\"This is sheer madness, Mr. Neefit.\"\n\n\"You think so;--do you, Captain? You'll find me madder nor you think\nfor yet. I'm not agoing to be put upon by you, and nothing come\nof it. I'll have it out of you in money or marbles, as the saying\nis. Just order me a glass of sherry wine, will you? I'm a thirsty\ntalking. When you came a visiting me, I always give you lashings of\ndrink.\" This was so true that Ralph felt himself compelled to ring\nthe bell, and order up some wine. \"Soda and brandy let it be, Jack,\"\nsaid Mr. Neefit to Mr. Newton's own man. \"It'll be more comfortable\nlike between near relations.\"\n\n\"Soda-water and brandy for Mr. Neefit,\" said the young Squire,\nturning angrily to the man. \"Mr. Neefit, you are perfectly welcome to\nas much brandy as you can drink, and my man will wait upon you while\nI'm away. Good morning.\" Whereupon Newton took up his hat and left\nthe room. He had not passed into the little back room, in which he\nknew that the servant would be looking for soda-water, before he\nheard a sound as of smashed crockery, and he was convinced that Mr.\nNeefit was preparing himself for forcible eviction by breaking his\nornaments. Let the ornaments go, and the mirror, and the clock on\nthe chimney-piece, and the windows. It was a frightful nuisance, but\nanything would be better than sending for the police to take away Mr.\nNeefit. \"Keep your eye on that man in the front room,\" said he, to\nhis Swiss valet.\n\n\"On Mr. Neefit, saar?\"\n\n\"Yes; on Mr. Neefit. He wants me to marry his daughter, and I can't\noblige him. Let him have what he wants to eat and drink. Get rid of\nhim if you can, but don't send for the police. He's smashing all the\nthings, and you must save as many as you can.\" So saying, he hurried\ndown the stairs and out of the house. But what was he to do next?\nIf Mr. Neefit chose to carry out his threat by staying in the rooms,\nMr. Neefit must be allowed to have his own way. If he chose to amuse\nhimself by breaking the things, the things must be broken. If he got\nvery drunk, he might probably be taken home in a cab, and deposited\nat the cottage at Hendon. But what should Ralph do at this moment?\nHe sauntered sadly down St. James's Street with his hands in his\ntrousers-pockets, and finding a crawling hansom at the palace-gate,\nhe got into it and ordered the man to drive him down to Fulham. He\nhad already made up his mind about \"dear little Clary,\" and the thing\nmight as well be done at once. None of the girls were at home. Miss\nUnderwood and Miss Bonner had gone up to London to see Sir Thomas.\nMiss Clarissa was spending the day with Mrs. Brownlow. \"That will\njust be right,\" said Ralph to himself, as he ordered the cabman to\ndrive him to the old lady's house on the Brompton Road.\n\nMrs. Brownlow had ever been a great admirer of the young Squire,\nand did not admire him less now that he had come to his squireship.\nShe had always hoped that Clary would marry the real heir, and was\nsounding his praises while Ralph was knocking at her door. \"He is not\nhalf so fine a fellow as his brother,\" said Clarissa.\n\n\"You did not use to think so,\" said Mrs. Brownlow. Then the door was\nopened and Ralph was announced.\n\nWith his usual easy manner,--with that unabashed grace which Clarissa\nused to think so charming,--he soon explained that he had been to\nFulham, and had had himself driven back to Bolsover House because\nClarissa was there. Clarissa, as she heard this, felt the blood\ntingle in her cheeks. His manner now did not seem to her to be so\nfull of grace. Was it not all selfishness? Mrs. Brownlow purred\nout her applause. It was not to be supposed that he came to see\nan old woman;--but his coming to see a young woman, with adequate\nintentions, was quite the proper thing for such a young man to do!\nThey were just going to take lunch. Of course he would stop and\nlunch with them. He declared that he would like nothing better.\nMrs. Brownlow rang the bell, and gave her little orders. Clarissa's\nthoughts referred quickly to various matters,--to the scene on the\nlawn, to a certain evening on which she had walked home with him from\nthis very house, to the confessions which she had made to her sister,\nto her confidence with her cousin;--and then to the offer that had\nbeen made to Mary, now only a few weeks since. She looked at him,\nthough she did not seem to be looking at him, and told herself that\nthe man was nothing to her. He had caused her unutterable sorrow,\nwith which her heart was still sore;--but he was nothing to her. She\nwould eat her lunch with him, and endeavour to talk to him; but the\nless she might see of him henceforth the better. He was selfish,\nheartless, weak, and unworthy.\n\nThe lunch was eaten, and within three minutes afterwards, Mrs.\nBrownlow was away. As they were returning to the little parlour in\nwhich they had been sitting during the morning, she contrived to\nescape, and Ralph found himself alone with his \"dear, darling little\nClary.\" In spite of his graceful ease, the task before him was not\nwithout difficulty. Clarissa, of course, knew that he had proposed to\nMary, and probably knew that he had proposed to Polly. But Mary had\ntold him that Clarissa was devoted to him,--had told him at least\nthat which amounted to almost as much. And then it was incumbent on\nhim to do something that might put an end to the Neefit abomination.\nClarissa would be contented to look back upon that episode with\nMary Bonner, as a dream that meant nothing;--just as he himself was\nalready learning to look at it. \"Clary,\" he said, \"I have hardly seen\nyou to speak to you since the night we walked home together from this\nhouse.\"\n\n\"No, indeed, Mr. Newton,\" she said. Hitherto she had always called\nhim Ralph. He did not observe the change, having too many things of\nhis own to think of at the moment.\n\n\"How much has happened since that!\"\n\n\"Very much, indeed, Mr. Newton.\"\n\n\"And yet it seems to be such a short time ago,--almost yesterday. My\npoor uncle was alive then.\"\n\n\"Yes, he was.\"\n\nHe did not seem to be getting any nearer to his object by these\nreferences to past events. \"Clary,\" he said, \"there are many things\nwhich I wish to have forgotten, and some perhaps which I would have\nforgiven.\"\n\n\"I suppose that is so with all of us,\" said Clarissa.\n\n\"Just so, though I don't know that any of us have ever been so\nabsurdly foolish as I have,--throwing away what was of the greatest\nvalue in the world for the sake of something that seemed to be\nprecious, just for a moment.\" It was very difficult, and he already\nbegan to feel that the nature of the girl was altered towards him.\nShe had suddenly become hard, undemonstrative, and almost unkind.\nHitherto he had always regarded her, without much conscious thought\nabout it, as a soft, sweet, pleasant thing, that might at any moment\nbe his for the asking. And Mary Bonner had told him that he ought to\nask. Now he was willing to beseech her pardon, to be in very truth\nher lover, and to share with her all his prosperity. But she would\ngive him no assistance in his difficulty. He was determined that she\nshould speak, and, trusting to Mrs. Brownlow's absence, he sat still,\nwaiting for her.\n\n\"I hope you have thrown away nothing that you ought to keep,\" she\nsaid at last. \"It seems to me that you have got everything.\"\n\n\"No,--not as yet everything. I do not know whether I shall ever get\nthat which I desire the most.\" Of course she understood him now;\nbut she sat hard, and fixed, and stern,--so absolutely unlike the\nClarissa whom he had known since they were hardly more than children\ntogether! \"You know what I mean, Clarissa.\"\n\n\"No;--I do not,\" she said.\n\n\"I fear you mean that you cannot forgive me.\"\n\n\"I have nothing to forgive.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, you have; whether you will ever forgive me I cannot say. But\nthere is much to forgive;--very much. Your cousin Mary for a short\nmoment ran away with us all.\"\n\n\"She is welcome,--for me.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Clarissa?\"\n\n\"Just what I say. She is welcome for me. She has taken nothing\nthat I prize. Indeed I do not think she has condescended to take\nanything,--anything of the sort you mean. Mary and I love each other\ndearly. There is no danger of our quarrelling.\"\n\n\"Come, Clary,\" he got up as he spoke, and stood over her, close to\nher shoulder, \"you understand well enough what I mean. We have known\neach other so long, and I think we have loved each other so well,\nthat you ought to say that you will forgive me. I have been foolish.\nI have been wrong. I have been false, if you will. Cannot you forgive\nme?\"\n\nNot for a moment was there a look of forgiveness in her eye, or a\nsign of pardon in the lines of her face. But in her heart there was\na contest. Something of the old passion remained there, though it\nwas no more than the soreness it had caused. For half a moment she\nthought whether it might not be as he would have it. But if so, how\ncould she again look any of her friends in the face and admit that\nshe had surrendered herself to so much unworthiness? How could she\ntell Patience, who was beginning to be full of renewed hope for\nGregory? How could she confess such a weakness to her father? How\ncould she stand up before Mary Bonner? And was it possible that\nshe should really give herself, her whole life, and all her future\nhopes, to one so weak and worthless as this man? \"There is nothing to\nforgive,\" she said, \"but I certainly cannot forget.\"\n\n\"You know that I love you,\" he protested.\n\n\"Love me;--yes, with what sort of love? But it does not matter. There\nneed be no further talk about it. Your love to me can be nothing.\"\n\n\"Clarissa!\"\n\n\"And to you it will be quite as little. Your heart will never suffer\nmuch, Ralph. How long is it since you offered your hand to my cousin?\nOnly that you are just a boy playing at love, this would be an\ninsult.\" Then she saw her old friend through the window. \"Mrs.\nBrownlow,\" she said, \"Mr. Newton is going, and I am ready for our\nwalk whenever you please.\"\n\n\"Think of it twice, Clarissa;--must this be the end of it?\" pleaded\nRalph.\n\n\"As far as I am concerned it must be the end of it. When I get home I\nshall probably find that you have already made an offer to Patience.\"\nThen he got up, took his hat, and having shaken hands cordially with\nMrs. Brownlow through the window, went out to his hansom cab, which\nwas earning sixpence a quarter of an hour out on the road, while he\nhad been so absolutely wasting his quarter of an hour within the\nhouse.\n\n\"Has he said anything, my dear?\" asked Mrs. Brownlow.\n\n\"He has said a great deal.\"\n\n\"Well, my dear?\"\n\n\"He is an empty, vain, inconstant man.\"\n\n\"Is he, Clarissa?\"\n\n\"And yet he is so good-humoured, and so gay, and so pleasant, that I\ndo not see why he should not make a very good husband to some girl.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Clarissa? You have not refused him?\"\n\n\"I did not say he had offered;--did I?\"\n\n\"But he has?\"\n\n\"If he did,--then I refused him. He is good-natured; but he has no\nmore heart than a log of wood. Don't talk about it any more, dear\nMrs. Brownlow. I dare say we shall all be friends again before long,\nand he'll almost forget everything that he said this morning.\"\n\nThroughout the afternoon she was gay and almost happy, and before she\nwent home she had made up her mind that she would tell Patience, and\nthen get rid of it from her thoughts for ever. Not to tell Patience\nwould be a breach of faith between them, and would moreover render\nfuture sisterly intercourse between them very difficult. But had\nit been possible she would have avoided the expression of triumph\nwithout which it would be almost impossible for her to tell the\nstory. Within her own bosom certainly there was some triumph. The man\nfor whose love she had sighed and been sick had surrendered to her at\nlast. The prize had been at her feet, but she had not chosen to lift\nit. \"Poor Ralph,\" she said to herself; \"he means to do as well as he\ncan, but he is so feeble.\" She certainly would not tell Mary Bonner,\nnor would she say a word to her father. And when she should meet\nRalph again,--as she did not doubt but that she would meet him\nshortly, she would be very careful to give no sign that she was\nthinking of his disgrace. He should still be called Ralph,--till\nhe was a married man; and when it should come to pass that he was\nabout to marry she would congratulate him with all the warmth of old\nfriendship.\n\nThat night she did tell it all to Patience. \"You don't mean,\" she\nsaid, \"that I have not done right?\"\n\n\"I am sure you have done quite right.\"\n\n\"Then why are you so sober about it, Patty?\"\n\n\"Only if you do love him--! I would give my right hand, Clary, that\nyou might have that which shall make you happy in life.\"\n\n\"If you were to give your right and left hand too, a marriage with\nRalph Newton would not make me happy. Think of it, Patty;--to both\nof us within two months! He is just like a child. How could I ever\nhave respected him, or believed in him? I could never have respected\nmyself again. No, Patty, I did love him dearly. I fancied that life\nwithout him must all be a dreary blank. I made him into a god;--but\nhis feet are of the poorest clay! Kiss me, dear, and congratulate\nme;--because I have escaped.\"\n\nHer sister did kiss her and did congratulate her;--but still there\nwas a something of regret in the sister's heart. Clarissa was, to her\nthinking, so fit to be the mistress of Newton Priory.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI.\n\nMUSIC HAS CHARMS.\n\n\nThe Commission appointed to examine into the condition of the borough\nof Percycross cannot exactly be said to have made short work of it,\nfor it sat daily for many consecutive weeks, and examined half the\nvoters in the town; but it made sharp work, and reported to the\nSpeaker of the House such a tale of continual corruption, that all\nthe world knew that the borough would be disfranchised. The glory\nof Percycross was gone, and in regard to political influence it was\nto be treated as the cities of the plain, and blotted from off the\nface of existence. The learned gentlemen who formed the Commission\nhad traced home to Mr. Griffenbottom's breeches-pockets large sums\nof money which had been expended in the borough for purposes of\nsystematised corruption during the whole term of his connection\nwith it;--and yet they were not very hard upon Mr. Griffenbottom\npersonally in their report. He had spent the money no doubt, but\nhad so spent it that at every election it appeared that he had not\nexpected to spend it till the bills were sent to him. He frankly\nowned that the borough had been ruinous to him; had made a poor man\nof him,--but assured the Commission at the same time that all this\nhad come from his continued innocence. As every new election came\nround, he had hoped that that would at least be pure, and had been\nurgent in his instructions to his agents to that effect. He had at\nlast learned, he said, that he was not a sufficient Hercules to\ncleanse so foul a stable. All this created no animosity against him\nin Percycross during the sitting of the Commission. His old friends,\nthe Triggers, and Piles, and Spiveycombs, clung to him as closely as\never. Every man in Percycross knew that the borough was gone, and\nthere really seemed at last to be something of actual gratitude\nin their farewell behaviour to the man who had treated the place\nas it liked to be treated. As the end of it all, the borough was\nundoubtedly to be disfranchised, and Mr. Griffenbottom left it,--a\nruined man, indeed, according to his own statement,--but still with\nhis colours flying, and, to a certain extent, triumphantly. So we\nwill leave him, trusting,--or perhaps rather hoping,--that the days\nof Mr. Griffenbottom are nearly at an end.\n\nHis colleague, Sir Thomas, on the occasion of his third visit to\nPercycross,--a visit which he was constrained to make, sorely against\nhis will, in order that he might give his evidence before the\nCommission,--remained there but a very short time. But while there he\nmade a clean breast of it. He had gone down to the borough with the\nmost steadfast purpose to avoid corruption; and had done his best in\nthat direction. But he had failed. There had been corruption, for\nwhich he had himself paid in part. There had been treating of the\ngrossest kind. Money had been demanded from him since the election,\nas to the actual destination of which he was profoundly ignorant. He\ndid not, however, doubt but that this money had been spent in the\npurchase of votes. Sir Thomas was supposed to have betrayed the\nborough in his evidence, and was hooted out of the town. On this\noccasion he only remained there one night, and left Percycross for\never, after giving his evidence.\n\nThis happened during the second week in May. On his return to London\nhe did not go down to Fulham, but remained at his chambers in a most\nunhappy frame of mind. This renewed attempt of his to enter the world\nand to go among men that he might do a man's work, had resulted in\nthe loss of a great many hundred pounds, in absolute failure, and, as\nhe wrongly told himself, in personal disgrace. He was almost ashamed\nto show himself at his club, and did for two days absolutely have his\ndinner brought to him in his chambers from an eating-house.\n\n\"I'm sure you won't like that, Sir Thomas,\" Stemm had said to him,\nexpostulating, and knowing very well the nature of his master's\nsufferings.\n\n\"I don't know that I like anything very much,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"I wouldn't go and not show my face because of other people's\nroguery,\" rejoined Stemm, with cruel audacity. Sir Thomas looked at\nhim, but did not answer a word, and Stemm fetched the food.\n\n\"Stemm,\" said Sir Thomas the same evening, \"it's getting to be fine\nweather now.\"\n\n\"It's fine enough,\" said Stemm.\n\n\"Do you take your nieces down to Southend for an outing. Go down on\nThursday and come back on Saturday. I shall be at home. There's a\nfive-pound note for the expenses.\" Stemm slowly took the note, but\ngrunted and grumbled. The girls were nuisances to him, and he didn't\nwant to take them an outing. They wouldn't care to go before July,\nand he didn't care to go at all. \"You can go when you please,\" said\nSir Thomas. Stemm growled and grumbled, and at last left the room\nwith the money.\n\nThe morning afterwards Sir Thomas was sitting alone in his room\nabsolutely wretched. He had so managed his life that there seemed to\nbe nothing left to him in it worth the having. He had raised himself\nto public repute by his intellect and industry, and had then, almost\nat once, allowed himself to be hustled out of the throng simply\nbecause others had been rougher than he,--because other men had\npushed and shouldered while he had been quiet and unpretending. Then\nhe had resolved to make up for this disappointment by work of another\nkind,--by work which would, after all, be more congenial to him. He\nwould go back to the dream of his youth, to the labours of former\ndays, and would in truth write his Life of Bacon. He had then\nsurrounded himself with his papers, had gotten his books together and\nread up his old notes, had planned chapters and sections, and settled\ndivisions, had drawn up headings, and revelled in those paraphernalia\nof work which are so dear to would-be working men;--and then nothing\nhad come of it. Of what use was it that he went about ever with a\nvolume in his pocket, and read a page or two as he sat over his wine?\nWhen sitting alone in his room he did read; but when reading he knew\nthat he was not working. He went, as it were, round and round the\nthing, never touching it, till the labour which he longed to commence\nbecame so frightful to him that he did not dare to touch it. To do\nthat thing was the settled purpose of his life, and yet, from day to\nday and from month to month, it became more impossible to him even\nto make a beginning. There is a misery in this which only they who\nhave endured it can understand. There are idle men who rejoice in\nidleness. Their name is legion. Idleness, even when it is ruinous, is\ndelightful to them. They revel in it, look forward to it, and almost\ntake a pride in it. When it can be had without pecuniary detriment,\nit is to such men a thing absolutely good in itself. But such a\none was not Sir Thomas Underwood. And there are men who love work,\nwho revel in that, who attack it daily with renewed energy, almost\nwallowing in it, greedy of work, who go to it almost as the drunkard\ngoes to his bottle, or the gambler to his gaming-table. These are not\nunhappy men, though they are perhaps apt to make those around them\nunhappy. But such a one was not Sir Thomas Underwood. And again there\nare men, fewer in number, who will work though they hate it, from\nsheer conscience and from conviction that idleness will not suit them\nor make them happy. Strong men these are;--but such a one certainly\nwas not Sir Thomas Underwood. Then there are they who love the idea\nof work, but want the fibre needful for the doing it. It may be that\nsuch a one will earn his bread as Sir Thomas Underwood had earned\nhis, not flinching from routine task or even from the healthy efforts\nnecessary for subsistence. But there will ever be present to the\nmind of the ambitious man the idea of something to be done over and\nabove the mere earning of his bread;--and the ambition may be very\nstrong, though the fibre be lacking. Such a one will endure an\nagony protracted for years, always intending, never performing,\nself-accusing through every wakeful hour, self-accusing almost\nthrough every sleeping hour. The work to be done is close there\nby the hand, but the tools are loathed, and the paraphernalia of\nit become hateful. And yet it can never be put aside. It is to be\ngrasped to-morrow, but on every morrow the grasping of it becomes\nmore difficult, more impossible, more revolting. There is no\npeace, no happiness for such a man;--and such a one was Sir Thomas\nUnderwood.\n\nIn this strait he had been tempted to make another effort in\npolitical life, and he had made it. There had been no difficulty in\nthis,--only that the work itself had been so disagreeable, and that\nhe had failed in it so egregiously. During his canvass, and in all\nhis intercourse with the Griffenbottomites, he had told himself,\nfalsely, how pleasant to him it would be to return to his books;--how\nmuch better for him would be a sedentary life, if he could only bring\nhimself to do, or even attempt to do, the work which he had appointed\nfor himself. Now he had returned to his solitude, had again dragged\nout his papers, his note-book, his memoranda, his dates, and yet he\ncould not in truth get into his harness, put his neck to the collar,\nand attempt to drag the burden up the hill.\n\nHe was sitting alone in his room in this condition, with a book\nin his hand of no value to his great purpose, hating himself and\nwretched, when Stemm opened his door, ushering Patience and Mary\nBonner into his room. \"Ah, my dears,\" he said, \"what has brought\nyou up to London? I did not think of seeing you here.\" There was\nno expression of positive displeasure in his voice, but it was\nunderstood by them all, by the daughter, by the cousin, by old Stemm,\nand by Sir Thomas himself, that such a visit as this was always to be\nregarded more or less as an intrusion. However, he kissed them both,\nand handed them chairs, and was more than usually civil to them.\n\n\"We do so want to hear about Percycross, papa,\" said Patience.\n\n\"There is nothing to be told about Percycross.\"\n\n\"Are you to stand again, papa?\"\n\n\"Nobody will ever stand for Percycross again. It will lose its\nmembers altogether. The thing is settled.\"\n\n\"And you have had all the trouble for nothing, uncle?\" Mary asked.\n\n\"All for nothing,--and the expense. But that is a very common thing,\nand I have no ground of complaint beyond many others.\"\n\n\"It does seem so hard,\" said Patience.\n\n\"So very hard,\" said Mary. And then they were silent. They had not\ncome without a purpose; but, as is common with young ladies, they\nkept their purpose for the end of the interview.\n\n\"Are you coming home, papa?\" Patience asked.\n\n\"Well, yes; I won't settle any day now, because I am very busy just\nat present. But I shall be home soon,--very soon.\"\n\n\"I do so hope you'll stay some time with us, papa.\"\n\n\"My dear, you know--\" And then he stopped, having been pounced upon\nso suddenly that he had not resolved what excuse he would for the\nmoment put forward. \"I've got my papers and things in such confusion\nhere at present,--because of Percycross and the trouble I have\nhad,--that I cannot leave them just now.\"\n\n\"But why not bring the papers with you, papa?\"\n\n\"My dear, you know I can't.\"\n\nThen there was another pause. \"Papa, I think you ought,\" said\nPatience. \"Indeed I do, for Clary's sake,--and ours.\" But even this\nwas not the subject which had specially brought them on that morning\nto Southampton Buildings.\n\n\"What is there wrong with Clary?\" asked Sir Thomas.\n\n\"There is nothing wrong,\" said Patience\n\n\"What do you mean then?\"\n\n\"I think it would be so much more comfortable for her that you should\nsee things as they are going on.\"\n\n\"I declare I don't know what she means. Do you know what she means,\nMary?\"\n\n\"Clary has not been quite herself lately,\" said Mary.\n\n\"I suppose it's something about that scamp, Ralph Newton,\" said Sir\nThomas.\n\n\"No, indeed, papa; I am sure she does not think of him now.\" On this\nvery morning, as the reader may perhaps remember, the scamp had\ngone down to Fulham, and from Fulham back to Brompton, in search of\nClarissa; but of the scamp's energy and renewed affections, Patience\nas yet knew nothing. \"Gregory has been up in London and has been down\nat Fulham once or twice. We want him to come again before he goes\nback on Saturday, and we thought if you would come home on Thursday,\nwe could ask him to dinner.\" Sir Thomas scratched his head, and\nfidgeted in his chair. \"Their cousin is in London also,\" continued\nPatience.\n\n\"The other Ralph; he who has bought Beamingham Hall?\"\n\n\"Yes, papa; we saw him at the Academy. I told him how happy you would\nbe to see him at Fulham.\"\n\n\"Of course I should be glad to see him; that is, if I happened to be\nat home,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"But I could not name a day without asking you, papa.\"\n\n\"He will have gone back by this time,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"I think not, papa.\"\n\n\"And what do you say, Mary?\"\n\n\"I have nothing to say at all, uncle. If Mr. Newton likes to come to\nthe villa, I shall be glad to see him. Why should I not? He has done\nnothing to offend me.\" There was a slight smile on her face as she\nspoke, and the merest hint of a blush on her cheek.\n\n\"They tell me that Beamingham Hall isn't much of a place after all,\"\nsaid Sir Thomas.\n\n\"From what Mr. Newton says, it must be a very ugly place,\" said Mary,\nwith still the same smile and the same hint of a blush;--\"only I\ndon't quite credit all he tells us.\"\n\n\"If there is anything settled you ought to tell me,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"There is nothing settled, uncle, or in any way of being settled.\nIt so happened that Mr. Newton did speak to me about his new house.\nThere is nothing more.\"\n\n\"Nevertheless, papa, pray let us ask him to dinner on Thursday.\" It\nwas for the purpose of making this request that Patience had come to\nSouthampton Buildings, braving her father's displeasure. Sir Thomas\nscratched his head, and rubbed his face, and yielded. Of course he\nhad no alternative but to yield, and yet he did it with a bad grace.\nPermission, however, was given, and it was understood that Patience\nwould write to the two young men, Ralph of Beamingham Hall and the\nparson, asking them to dinner for the day but one following. \"As\nthe time is so short, I've written the notes ready,\" said Patience,\nproducing them from her pocket. Then the bell was rung, and the two\nnotes were confided to Stemm. Patience, as she was going, found a\nmoment in which to be alone with her father, and to speak one more\nword to him. \"Dear papa, it would be so much better for us that you\nshould come and live at home. Think of those two, with nobody, as\nit were, to say a word for them.\" Sir Thomas groaned, and again\nscratched his head; but Patience left him before he had arranged his\nwords for an answer.\n\nWhen they were gone, Sir Thomas sat for hours in his chair without\nmoving, making the while one or two faint attempts at the book before\nhim, but in truth giving up his mind to contemplation of the past\nand to conjectures as to the future, burdened by heavy regrets, and\nwith hopes too weak to afford him any solace. The last words which\nPatience had spoken rang in his ears,--\"Think of those two, with\nnobody, as it were, to say a word for them.\" He did think of them,\nand of the speaker also, and knew that he had neglected his duty. He\ncould understand that such a girl as his own Clarissa did require\nsome one \"to say a word for her,\" some stalwart arm to hold her up,\nsome loving strength to support her, some counsel to direct her. Of\ncourse those three girls were as other girls, looking forward to\nmatrimony as their future lot in life, and it would not be well that\nthey should be left to choose or to be chosen, or left to reject and\nbe rejected, without any aid from their remaining parent. He knew\nthat he had been wrong, and he almost resolved that the chambers in\nSouthampton Buildings should be altogether abandoned, and his books\nremoved to Popham Villa.\n\nBut such men do not quite resolve. Before he could lay his hand upon\nthe table and assure himself that the thing should be done, the\nvolume had been taken up again, used for a few minutes, and then the\nman's mind had run away again to that vague contemplation which is\nso much easier than the forming of a steady purpose. It was one of\nthose almost sultry days which do come to us occasionally amidst\nthe ordinary inclemency of a London May, and he was sitting with\nhis window open, though there was a fire in the grate. As he sat,\ndreaming rather than thinking, there came upon his ear the weak,\nwailing, puny sound of a distant melancholy flute. He had heard it\noften before, and had been roused by it to evil wishes, and sometimes\neven to evil words, against the musician. It was the effort of some\nyouth in the direction of Staple's Inn to soothe with music the\nsavageness of his own bosom. It was borne usually on the evening air,\nbut on this occasion the idle swain had taken up his instrument\nwithin an hour or two of his early dinner. His melody was burdened\nwith no peculiar tune, but consisted of a few low, wailing,\nmelancholy notes, such as may be extracted from the reed by a breath\nand the slow raising and falling of the little finger, much, we\nbelieve, to the comfort of the player, but to the ineffable disgust\nof, too often, a large circle of hearers.\n\nSir Thomas was affected by the sound long before he was aware that he\nwas listening to it. To-whew, to-whew; to-whew, to-whew; whew-to-to,\nwhew-to-to, whew, to-whew. On the present occasion the variation\nwas hardly carried beyond that; but so much was repeated with a\npersistency which at last seemed to burden the whole air round\nSouthampton Buildings. The little thing might have been excluded by\nthe closing of the window; but Sir Thomas, though he suffered, did\nnot reflect for a while whence the suffering came. Who does not know\nhow such sounds may serve to enhance the bitterness of remorse, to\nadd a sorrow to the present thoughts, and to rob the future of its\nhopes?\n\nThere come upon us all as we grow up in years, hours in which it is\nimpossible to keep down the conviction that everything is vanity,\nthat the life past has been vain from folly, and that the life to\ncome must be vain from impotence. It is the presence of thoughts such\nas these that needs the assurance of a heaven to save the thinker\nfrom madness or from suicide. It is when the feeling of this\npervading vanity is strongest on him, that he who doubts of heaven\nmost regrets his incapacity for belief. If there be nothing better\nthan this on to the grave,--and nothing worse beyond the grave, why\nshould I bear such fardels?\n\nSir Thomas, as he sat there listening and thinking, unable not to\nthink and not to listen, found that the fardels were very heavy. What\ngood had come to him of his life,--to him or to others? And what\nfurther good did he dare to promise to himself? Had it not all been\nvanity? Was it not all vain to him now at the present? Was not life\nbecoming to him vainer and still vainer every day? He had promised\nhimself once that books should be the solace of his age, and he was\nbeginning to hate his books, because he knew that he did no more than\ntrifle with them. He had found himself driven to attempt to escape\nfrom them back into public life; but had failed, and had been\ninexpressibly dismayed in the failure. While failing, he had promised\nhimself that he would rush at his work on his return to privacy and\nto quiet; but he was still as the shivering coward, who stands upon\nthe brink, and cannot plunge in among the bathers. And then there was\nsadness beyond this, and even deeper than this. Why should he have\ndared to arrange for himself a life different from the life of the\nordinary men and women who lived around him? Why had he not contented\nhimself with having his children around him; walking with them to\nchurch on Sunday morning, taking them to the theatre on Monday\nevening, and allowing them to read him to sleep after tea on the\nTuesday? He had not done these things, was not doing them now,\nbecause he had ventured to think himself capable of something that\nwould justify him in leaving the common circle. He had left it, but\nwas not justified. He had been in Parliament, had been in office,\nand had tried to write a book. But he was not a legislator, was\nnot a statesman, and was not an author. He was simply a weak, vain,\nwretched man, who, through false conceit, had been induced to neglect\nalmost every duty of life! To-whew, to-whew, to-whew, to-whew! As the\nsounds filled his ears, such were the thoughts which lay heavy on his\nbosom. So idle as he had been in thinking, so inconclusive, so frail,\nso subject to gusts of wind, so incapable of following his subject to\nthe end, why had he dared to leave that Sunday-keeping, church-going,\ndomestic, decent life, which would have become one of so ordinary a\ncalibre as himself? There are men who may doubt, who may weigh the\nevidence, who may venture to believe or disbelieve in compliance with\ntheir own reasoning faculties,--who may trust themselves to think\nit out; but he, too clearly, had not been, was not, and never\nwould be one of these. To walk as he saw other men walking around\nhim,--because he was one of the many; to believe that to be good\nwhich the teachers appointed for him declared to be good; to do\nprescribed duties without much personal inquiry into the causes which\nhad made them duties; to listen patiently, and to be content without\nexcitement; that was the mode of living for which he should have\nknown himself to be fit. But he had not known it, and had strayed\naway, and had ventured to think that he could think,--and had been\nambitious. And now he found himself stranded in the mud of personal\ncondemnation,--and that so late in life, that there remained to him\nno hope of escape. Whew-to-to; whew-to-to; whew,--to-whew. \"Stemm,\nwhy do you let that brute go on with his cursed flute?\" Stemm at that\nmoment had opened the door to suggest that as he usually dined at\none, and as it was now past three, he would go out and get a bit of\nsomething to eat.\n\n\"He's always at it, sir,\" said Stemm, pausing for a moment before he\nalluded to his own wants.\n\n\"Why the deuce is he always at it? Why isn't he indited for a\nnuisance? Who's to do anything with such a noise as that going on for\nhours together? He has nearly driven me mad.\"\n\n\"It's young Wobble as has the back attic, No. 17, in the Inn,\" said\nStemm.\n\n\"They ought to turn him out,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"I rather like it myself,\" said Stemm. \"It suits my disposition,\nsir.\" Then he made his little suggestion in regard to his own\npersonal needs, and of course was blown up for not having come in\ntwo hours ago to remind Sir Thomas that it was dinner-time. \"It's\nbecause I wouldn't disturb you when you has the Bacon papers out, Sir\nThomas,\" said Stemm serenely. Sir Thomas winced and shook his head;\nbut such scenes as this were too common to have much effect. \"Stemm!\"\nhe called aloud, as soon as the old clerk had closed the door;\n\"Stemm!\" Whereupon Stemm reappeared. \"Stemm, have some one here next\nweek to pack all these books.\"\n\n\"Pack all the books, Sir Thomas!\"\n\n\"Yes;--to pack all the books. There must be cases. Now, go and get\nyour dinner.\"\n\n\"New cases, Sir Thomas!\"\n\n\"That will do. Go and get your dinner.\" And yet his mind was not\nquite made up.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII.\n\nGUS EARDHAM.\n\n\nWhether Mr. Neefit broke Ralph Newton's little statuette,--a\nminiature copy in porcelain of the Apollo Belvidere, which stood in a\ncorner of Ralph's room, and in the possession of which he took some\npride,--from awkwardness in his wrath or of malice prepense, was\nnever known. He told the servant that he had whisked it down with\nhis coat tails; but Ralph always thought that the breeches-maker had\nintended to make a general ruin, but had been cowed by the noise of\nhis first attack. He did, at any rate, abstain from breaking other\nthings, and when the servant entered the room, condescended to make\nsome careless apology. \"A trifle like that ain't nothing between me\nand your master, Jack,\" said Mr. Neefit, after accounting for the\naccident by his coat-tails.\n\n\"I am not Jack,\" said the indignant valet, with a strong foreign\naccent. \"I am named--Adolphe.\"\n\n\"Adolphe, are you? I don't think much of Adolphe for a name;--but it\nain't no difference to me. Just pick up them bits; will you?\"\n\nThe man turned a look of scorn on Mr. Neefit, and did pick up the\nbits. He intended to obey his master as far as might be possible,\nbut was very unwilling to wait upon the breeches-maker. He felt that\nthe order which had been given to him was very cruel. It was his\nduty,--and his pleasure to wait upon gentlemen; but this man he\nknew to be a tradesman who measured customers for hunting apparel\nin his own shop. It was hard upon him that his master should go\nand leave him to be insulted, ordered about, and trodden upon by\na breeches-maker. \"Get me a bit of steak, will you?\" demanded\nNeefit;--\"a bit of the rump, not too much done, with the gravy in\nit,--and an onion. What are you staring at? Didn't you hear what your\nmaster said to you?\"\n\n\"Onion,--and romp-steak!\"\n\n\"Yes; rump-steak and onion. I ain't going out of this till I've had a\nbit of grub. Your master knows all about it. I'm going to have more\nnor that out of him before I've done with him.\"\n\nNeefit did at last succeed, and had his rump-steak and onion,\ntogether with more brandy and soda-water, eating and drinking as he\nsat in Ralph's beautiful new easy chair,--not very much to his own\ncomfort. A steak at the Prince's Feathers in Conduit Street would\nhave been very much more pleasant to him, and he would have preferred\nhalf-and-half in the pewter to brandy and soda-water;--but he felt a\npride in using his power in a fashion that would be disgraceful to\nhis host. When he had done his steak he pulled his pipe out of his\npocket, and smoked. Against this Adolphe remonstrated stoutly, but\nquite in vain. \"The Captain won't mind a little baccy-smoke out of my\npipe,\" he said. \"He always has his smoke comfortable when he comes\ndown to me.\" At last, about four o'clock, he did go away, assuring\nAdolphe that he would repeat his visit very soon. \"I means to see\na deal of the Captain this season,\" he said. At last, however, he\nretreated, and Adolphe opened the door of the house for him without\nspeaking a word. \"Bye, bye,\" said Neefit. \"I'll be here again before\nlong.\"\n\nRalph on that afternoon came home to dress for dinner at about seven,\nin great fear lest Neefit should still be found in his rooms. \"No,\nsaar; he go away at last!\" said Adolphe, with a melancholy shake of\nhis head.\n\n\"Has he done much harm?\"\n\n\"The Apollo gone!--and he had romp-steak,--and onions,--and a pipe.\nVat vas I to do? I hope he vill never come again.\" And so also did\nMr. Newton hope that Neefit would never come again.\n\nHe was going to dine with Lady Eardham, the wife of a Berkshire\nbaronet, who had three fair daughters. At this period of his life he\nfound the aristocracy of Berkshire and Hampshire to be very civil to\nhim; and, indeed, the world at large was disposed to smile on him.\nBut there was very much in his lot to make him unhappy. He had on\nthat morning been utterly rejected by Clarissa Underwood. It may,\nperhaps, be true that he was not a man to break his heart because a\ngirl rejected him. He was certainly one who could have sung the old\nsong, \"If she be not fair for me, what care I how fair she be.\" And\nyet Clarissa's conduct had distressed him, and had caused him to go\nabout throughout the whole afternoon with his heart almost in his\nboots. He had felt her coldness to him much more severely than he had\nthat of Mary Bonner. He had taught himself to look upon that little\nepisode with Mary as though it had really meant nothing. She had just\ncrossed the sky of his heaven like a meteor, and for a moment had\ndisturbed its serenity. And Polly also had been to him a false light,\nleading him astray for awhile under exceptional, and, as he thought,\nquite pardonable circumstances. But dear little Clary had been his\nown peculiar star,--a star that was bound to have been true to him,\neven though he might have erred for a moment in his worship,--a\nstar with a sweet, soft, enduring light, that he had always assured\nhimself he might call his own when he pleased. And now this soft,\nsweet star had turned upon him and scorched him. \"When I get home,\"\nshe had said to him, \"I shall find that you have already made an\noffer to Patience!\" He certainly had not expected such scorn from\nher. And then he was so sure in his heart that if she would have\naccepted him, he would have been henceforth so true to her, so good\nto her! He would have had such magnanimous pleasure in showering upon\nher pretty little head all the good things at his disposal, that,\nfor her own sake, the pity was great. When he had been five minutes\nin his cab, bowling back towards his club, he was almost minded to\nreturn and give her one more chance. She would just have suited him.\nAnd as for her,--would it not be a heaven on earth for her if she\nwould only consent to forget that foolish, unmeaning little episode.\nCould Clary have forgotten the episode, and been content to care\nlittle or nothing for that easiness of feeling which made our Ralph\nwhat he was, she might, probably, have been happy as the mistress of\nthe Priory. But she would not have forgotten, and would not have been\ncontent. She had made up her little heart stoutly that Ralph the heir\nshould sit in it no longer, and it was well for him that he did not\ngo back.\n\nHe went to his club instead,--not daring to go to his rooms. The\ninsanity of Neefit was becoming to him a terrible bane. It was, too,\na cruelty which he certainly had done nothing to deserve. He could\nlay his hand on his heart and assure himself that he had treated that\nmad, pig-headed tradesman well in all respects. He knew himself to\nbe the last man to make a promise, and then to break it wilfully. He\nhad certainly borrowed money of Neefit;--and at the probable cost\nof all his future happiness he had, with a nobleness which he could\nnot himself sufficiently admire, done his very best to keep the\nhard terms which in his distress he had allowed to be imposed upon\nhimself. He had been loyal, even to the breeches-maker;--and this was\nthe return which was made to him!\n\nWhat was he to do, should Neefit cling to his threat and remain\npermanently at his chambers? There were the police, and no doubt\nhe could rid himself of his persecutor. But he understood well the\nbarbarous power which some underbred, well-trained barrister would\nhave of asking him questions which it would be so very disagreeable\nfor him to answer! He lacked the courage to send for the police.\nJacky Joram had just distinguished himself greatly, and nearly\nexterminated a young gentleman who had married one girl while he was\nengaged to another. Jacky Joram might ask him questions as to his\nlittle dinners at Alexandra Lodge, which it would nearly kill him\nto answer. He was very unhappy, and began to think that it might\nbe as well that he should travel for twelve months. Neefit could\nnot persecute him up the Nile, or among the Rocky Mountains. And\nperhaps Clary's ferocity would have left her were he to return after\ntwelve months of glorious journeyings, still constant to his first\naffections. In the meantime he did not dare to go home till it would\nbe absolutely necessary that he should dress for dinner.\n\nIn the billiard-room of his club he found Lord Polperrow,--the eldest\nson of the Marquis of Megavissey,--pretty Poll, as he was called by\nmany young men, and by some young ladies, about town. Lord Polperrow\nhad become his fast friend since the day on which his heirship was\nestablished, and now encountered him with friendly intimacy. \"Halloa,\nNewton,\" said the young lord, \"have you seen old Neefit lately?\"\nThere were eight or ten men in the room, and suddenly there was\nsilence among the cues.\n\nRalph would have given his best horse to be able to laugh it off, but\nhe found that he could not laugh. He became very hot, and knew that\nhe was red in the face. \"What about old Neefit?\" he said.\n\n\"I've just come from Conduit Street, and he says that he has been\ndining with you. He swears that you are to marry his daughter.\"\n\n\"He be d----!\" said Newton. It was a poor way of getting out of the\nscrape, and so Ralph felt.\n\n\"But what's the meaning of it all? He's telling everybody about\nLondon that you went down to stay with him at Margate.\"\n\n\"Neefit has gone mad lately,\" said Captain Fooks, with a good-natured\ndetermination to stand by his friend in misfortune.\n\n\"But how about the girl, Newton?\" asked his lordship.\n\n\"You may have her yourself, Poll,--if she don't prefer a young\nshoemaker, to whom I believe she's engaged. She's very pretty, and\nhas got a lot of money--which will suit you to a T.\" He tried to put\na good face on it; but, nevertheless, he was very hot and red in the\nface.\n\n\"I'd put a stop to this if I were you,\" said another friend,\nconfidentially and in a whisper. \"He's not only telling everybody,\nbut writing letters about it.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know,\" said Ralph. \"How can I help what a madman does? It's a\nbore of course.\" Then he sauntered out again, feeling sure that his\ntransactions with Mr. Neefit would form the subject of conversation\nin the club billiard-room for the next hour and a half. It would\ncertainly become expedient that he should travel abroad.\n\nHe felt it to be quite a relief when he found that Mr. Neefit was not\nwaiting for him at his chambers. \"Adolphe,\" he said as soon as he was\ndressed, \"that man must never be allowed to put his foot inside the\ndoor again.\"\n\n\"Ah;--the Apollo gone! And he did it express!\"\n\n\"I don't mind the figure;--but he must never be allowed to enter the\nplace again. I shall not stay up long, but while we are here you must\nnot leave the place till six. He won't come in the evening.\" Then he\nput a sovereign into the man's hand, and went out to dine at Lady\nEardham's.\n\nLady Eardham had three fair daughters, with pretty necks, and\nflaxen hair, and blue eyes, and pug noses, all wonderfully alike.\nThey ranged from twenty-seven to twenty-one, there being sons\nbetween,--and it began to be desirable that they should be married.\nSince Ralph had been in town the Eardham mansion in Cavendish Square\nhad been opened to him with almost maternal kindness. He had accepted\nthe kindness; but being fully alive to the purposes of matronly\nintrigue, had had his little jokes in reference to the young ladies.\nHe liked young ladies generally, but was well aware that a young man\nis not obliged to offer his hand and heart to every girl that is\ncivil to him. He and the Eardham girls had been exceedingly intimate,\nbut he had had no idea whatever of sharing Newton Priory with an\nEardham. Now, however, in his misery he was glad to go to a house in\nwhich he would be received with an assured welcome.\n\nEverybody smiled upon him. Sir George in these days was very cordial,\ngreeting him with that genial esoteric warmth which is always felt by\none English country gentleman with a large estate for another equally\nblessed. Six months ago, when it was believed that Ralph had sold\nhis inheritance to his uncle, Sir George when he met the young man\naddressed him in a very different fashion. As he entered the room he\nfelt the warmth of the welcoming. The girls, one and all, had ever so\nmany things to say to him. They all hunted, and they all wanted him\nto look at horses for them. Lady Eardham was more matronly than ever,\nand at the same time was a little fussy. She would not leave him\namong the girls, and at last succeeded in getting him off into a\ncorner of the back drawing-room. \"Now, Mr. Newton,\" she said, \"I am\ngoing to show you that I put the greatest confidence in you.\"\n\n\"So you may,\" said Ralph, wondering whether one of the girls was to\nbe offered to him, out of hand. At the present moment he was so low\nin spirits that he would probably have taken either.\n\n\"I have had a letter,\" said Lady Eardham, whispering the words into\nhis ear;--and then she paused. \"Such a strange letter, and very\nabominable. I've shown it to no one,--not even to Sir George. I\nwouldn't let one of the girls see it for ever so much.\" Then there\nwas another pause. \"I don't believe a word of it, Mr. Newton; but I\nthink it right to show it to you,--because it's about you.\"\n\n\"About me?\" said Ralph, with his mind fixed at once upon Mr. Neefit.\n\n\"Yes, indeed;--and when I tell you it refers to my girls too, you\nwill see how strong is my confidence in you. If either had been\nspecially named, of course I could not have shown it.\" Then she\nhanded him the letter, which poor Ralph read, as follows:--\n\n\n   MY LADY,--I'm told as Mr. Ralph Newton, of Newton Priory,\n   is sweet upon one of your ladyship's daughters. I think\n   it my duty to tell your ladyship he's engaged to marry my\n   girl, Maryanne Neefit.\n\n   Yours most respectful,\n\n   THOMAS NEEFIT,\n   Breeches-Maker, Conduit Street.\n\n\n\"It's a lie,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"I'm sure it's a lie,\" said Lady Eardham, \"only I thought it right to\nshow it you.\"\n\nRalph took Gus Eardham down to dinner, and did his very best to make\nhimself agreeable. Gus was the middle one of the three, and was\ncertainly a fine girl. The Eardham girls would have no money; but\nRalph was not a greedy man,--except when he was in great need. It\nmust not be supposed, however, that on this occasion he made up his\nmind to marry Gus Eardham. But, as on previous occasions, he had been\nable to hold all the Eardhams in a kind of subjection to himself,\nfeeling himself to be bigger than they,--as hitherto he had been\nconscious that he was bestowing and they receiving,--so now, in his\npresent misfortune, did he recognise that Gus was a little bigger\nthan himself, and that it was for her to give and for him to take.\nAnd Gus was able to talk to him as though she also entertained the\nsame conviction. Gus was very kind to him, and he felt grateful to\nher.\n\nLady Eardham saw Gus alone in her bedroom that night. \"I believe he's\na very good young man,\" said Lady Eardham, \"if he's managed rightly.\nAnd as for all this about the horrid man's daughter, it don't matter\nat all. He'd live it down in a month if he were married.\"\n\n\"I don't think anything about that, mamma. I dare say he's had his\nfun,--just like other men.\"\n\n\"Only, my dear, he's one of that sort that have to be fixed.\"\n\n\"It's so hard to fix them, mamma.\"\n\n\"It needn't be hard to fix him,--that is, if you'll only be steady.\nHe's not sharp and hard and callous, like some of them. He doesn't\nmean any harm, and if he once speaks out, he isn't one that can't be\nkept to time. His manners are nice. I don't think the property is\ninvolved; but I'll find out from papa; and he's just the man to think\nhis wife the pink of perfection.\" Lady Eardham had read our hero's\ncharacter not inaccurately.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII.\n\nTHE END OF POLLY NEEFIT.\n\n\nRumours, well-supported rumours, as to the kind of life which Mr.\nNeefit was leading reached Alexandra Cottage, filling Mrs. Neefit's\nmind with dismay, and making Polly very angry indeed. He came home\nalways somewhat the worse for drink, and would talk of punching the\nheads both of Mr. Newton and of Mr. Ontario Moggs. Waddle, who was\nvery true to his master's interests, had taken an opportunity of\nseeing Mrs. Neefit, and of expressing a very distinct idea that the\nbusiness was going to the mischief. Mrs. Neefit was of opinion that\nin this emergency the business should be sold, and that they might\nsafely remove themselves to some distant country,--to Tunbridge, or\nperhaps to Ware. Polly, however, would not accede to her mother's\nviews. The evil must, she thought, be cured at once. \"If father goes\non like this, I shall just walk straight out of the house, and marry\nMoggs at once,\" Polly said. \"Father makes no account of my name, and\nso I must just look out for myself.\" She had not as yet communicated\nthese intentions to Ontario, but she was quite sure that she would be\nsupported in her views by him whenever she should choose to do so.\n\nOnce or twice Ontario came down to the cottage, and when he did so,\nMr. Neefit was always told of the visit. \"I ain't going to keep\nanything from father, mother,\" Polly would say. \"If he chooses\nto misbehave, that isn't my fault. I mean to have Mr. Moggs, and\nit's only natural I should like to see him.\" Neefit, when informed\nof these visits, after swearing that Moggs junior was a sneaking\nscoundrel to come to his house in his absence, would call upon Moggs\nsenior, and swear with many threats that his daughter should have\nnothing but what she stood up in. Moggs senior would stand quite\nsilent, cutting the skin on his hand with his shoemaker's knife, and\nwould simply bid the infuriated breeches-maker good morning, when\nhe left the shop. But, in truth, Mr. Moggs senior had begun to doubt.\n\"I'd leave it awhile, Onty, if I was you,\" he said. \"May be, after\nall, he'll give her nothing.\"\n\n\"I'll take her the first day she'll come to me,--money or no money,\"\nsaid Moggs junior.\n\nFoiled ambition had, in truth, driven the breeches-maker to madness.\nBut there were moments in which he was softened, melancholy, and\nalmost penitent. \"Why didn't you have him when he come down to\nMargate,\" he said, with the tears running down his cheek, that very\nevening after eating his rump-steak in Mr. Newton's rooms. The\nsoda-water and brandy, with a little gin-and-water after it, had\nreduced him to an almost maudlin condition, so that he was unable to\nsupport his parental authority.\n\n\"Because I didn't choose, father. It wasn't his fault. He spoke fair\nenough,--though I don't suppose he ever wanted it. Why should he?\"\n\n\"You might have had him then. He'd 've never dared to go back. I'd a\nkilled him if he had.\"\n\n\"What good would it have done, father? He'd never have loved me, and\nhe'd have despised you and mother.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't 've minded that,\" said Mr. Neefit, wiping his eyes.\n\n\"But I should have minded. What should I have felt with a husband\nas wouldn't have wanted me ever to have my own father in his house?\nWould that have made me happy?\"\n\n\"It 'd 've made me happy to know as you was there.\"\n\n\"No, father; there would have been no happiness in it. When I came to\nsee what he was I knew I should never love him. He was just willing\nto take me because of his word;--and was I going to a man like that?\nNo, father;--certainly not.\" The poor man was at that moment too far\ngone in his misery to argue the matter further, and he lay on the\nold sofa, very much at Polly's mercy. \"Drop it, father,\" she said.\n\"It wasn't to be, and it couldn't have been. You'd better say you'll\ndrop it.\" But, sick and uncomfortable as he was on that evening, he\ncouldn't be got to say that he would drop it.\n\nNor could he be got to drop it for some ten days after that;--but\non a certain evening he had come home very uncomfortable from the\neffects of gin-and-water, and had been spoken to very sensibly both\nby his wife and daughter.\n\nBy seven on the following morning Ontario Moggs was sitting in the\nfront parlour of the house at Hendon, and Polly Neefit was sitting\nwith him. He had never been there at so early an hour before, and\nit was thought afterwards by both Mr. and Mrs. Neefit that his\nappearance, so unexpected by them, had not surprised their daughter\nPolly. Could it have been possible that she had sent a message to him\nafter that little scene with her father? There he was, at any rate,\nand Polly was up to receive him. \"Now, Onty, that'll do. I didn't\nwant to talk nonsense, but just to settle something.\"\n\n\"But you'll tell a fellow that you're glad to see him?\"\n\n\"No, I won't. I won't tell a fellow anything he doesn't know already.\nYou and I have got to get married.\"\n\n\"Of course we have.\"\n\n\"But we want father's consent. I'm not going to have him made\nunhappy, if I can help it. He's that wretched sometimes at present\nthat my heart is half killed about him.\"\n\n\"The things he says are monstrous,\" asserted Moggs, thinking of the\nprotestation lately made by the breeches-maker in his own hearing,\nto the effect that Ralph Newton should yet be made to marry his\ndaughter.\n\n\"All the same I've got to think about him. There's a dozen or so\nof men as would marry me, Mr. Moggs; but I can never have another\nfather.\"\n\n\"I'll be the first of the dozen any way,\" said the gallant Ontario.\n\n\"That depends. However, mother says so, and if father 'll consent,\nI won't go against it. I'll go to him now, before he's up, and I'll\ntell him you're here. I'll bring him to his senses if I can. I don't\nknow whatever made him think so much about gentlemen.\"\n\n\"He didn't learn it from you, Polly.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he did, after all; and if so, that's the more reason why I'd\nforgive him.\" So saying, Polly went up-stairs upon her mission. On\nthe landing she met her mother, and made known the fact that Ontario\nwas in the parlour. \"Don't you go to him, mother;--not yet,\" said\nPolly. Whereby it may be presumed that Mrs. Neefit had been informed\nof Mr. Moggs's visit before Polly had gone to him.\n\nMr. Neefit was in bed, and his condition apparently was not a happy\none. He was lying with his head between his hands, and was groaning,\nnot loudly, but very bitterly. His mode of life for the last month\nhad not been of a kind to make him comfortable, and his conscience,\ntoo, was ill at ease. He had been a hard-working man, who had loved\nrespectability and been careful of his wife and child. He had been\nproud to think that nobody could say anything against him, and that\nhe had always paid his way. Up to the time of this disastrous fit of\nambition on Polly's behalf he had never made himself ridiculous, and\nhad been a prosperous tradesman, well thought of by his customers.\nSuddenly he had become mad, but not so mad as to be unconscious\nof his own madness. The failure of his hopes, joined to the\ninexpressibly bitter feeling that in their joint transactions young\nNewton had received all that had been necessary to him, whereas he,\nNeefit, had got none of that for which he had bargained,--these\ntogether had so upset him that he had lost his balance, had travelled\nout of his usual grooves, and had made an ass of himself. He knew he\nhad made an ass of himself,--and was hopelessly endeavouring to show\nhimself to be less of an ass than people thought him, by some success\nin his violence. If he could only punish young Newton terribly,\npeople would understand why he had done all this. But drink had been\nnecessary to give him courage for his violence, and now as he lay\nmiserable in bed, his courage was very low.\n\n\"Father,\" said Polly, \"shall I give you a drink?\" Neefit muttered\nsomething, and took the cold tea that was offered to him. It was\ncold tea, with just a spoonful of brandy in it to make it acceptable.\n\"Father, there ought to be an end of all this;--oughtn't there?\"\n\n\"I don't know about no ends. I'll be down on him yet.\"\n\n\"No you won't, father. And why should you? He has done nothing wrong\nto you or me. I wouldn't have him if it was ever so.\"\n\n\"It's all been your fault, Polly.\"\n\n\"Yes;--my fault; that I wouldn't be made what you call a lady; to be\ntaken away, so that I'd never see any more of you and mother!\" Then\nshe put her hand gently on his shoulder. \"I couldn't stand that,\nfather.\"\n\n\"I'd make him let you come to us.\"\n\n\"A wife must obey her husband, father. Mother always obeyed you.\"\n\n\"No, she didn't. She's again me now.\"\n\n\"Besides, I don't want to be a lady,\" said Polly, seeing that she had\nbetter leave that question of marital obedience; \"and I won't be a\nlady. I won't be better than you and mother.\"\n\n\"You've been brought up better.\"\n\n\"I'll show my breeding, then, by being true to you, and true to the\nman I love. What would you think of your girl, if she was to give her\nhand to a--gentleman, when she'd given her heart to a--shoemaker?\"\n\n\"Oh, d---- the shoemaker!\"\n\n\"No, father, I won't have it. What is there against Ontario? He's a\nfine-hearted fellow, as isn't greedy after money,--as 'd kiss the\nvery ground I stand on he's that true to me, and is a tradesman as\nyourself. If we had a little place of our own, wouldn't Ontario be\nproud to have you there, and give you the best of everything; and\nwouldn't I wait upon you, just only trying to know beforehand every\ntittle as you'd like to have. And if there was to be babies, wouldn't\nthey be brought up to love you. If I'd gone with that young man down\nto his fine place, do you think it would have been like that? How 'd\nI've felt when he was too proud to let his boy know as you was my\nfather?\" Neefit turned on his bed and groaned. He was too ill at ease\nas to his inner man to argue the subject from a high point of view,\nor to assert that he was content to be abased himself in order that\nhis child and grandchildren might be raised in the world. \"Father,\"\nsaid Polly, \"you have always been kind to me. Be kind to me now.\"\n\n\"The young 'uns is always to have their own way,\" said Neefit.\n\n\"Hasn't my way been your way, father?\"\n\n\"Not when you wouldn't take the Captain when he come to Margate.\"\n\n\"I didn't love him, father. Dear father, say the word. We haven't\nbeen happy lately;--have we, father?\"\n\n\"I ain't been very 'appy,\" said Neefit, bursting out into sobs.\n\nShe put her face upon his brow and kissed it. \"Father, let us be\nhappy again. Ontario is down-stairs,--in the parlour now.\"\n\n\"Ontario Moggs in my parlour!\" said Neefit, jumping up in bed.\n\n\"Yes, father; Ontario Moggs,--my husband, as will be; the man I\nhonour and love; the man that will honour and love you; as true a\nfellow as ever made a young woman happy by taking her. Let me tell\nhim that you will have him for a son.\" In truth, Neefit did not speak\nthe word;--but when Polly left the room, which she presently did\nafter a long embrace, Mr. Neefit was aware that his consent to the\nunion would be conveyed to Ontario Moggs in less than five minutes.\n\n\"And now you can name the day,\" said Ontario.\n\n\"I cannot do any such thing,\" replied Polly; \"and I think that quite\nenough has been settled for one morning. It's give an inch and take\nan ell with some folks.\"\n\nOntario waited for breakfast, and had an interview with his future\nfather-in-law. It was an hour after the scene up-stairs before Mr.\nNeefit could descend, and when he did come down he was not very\njovial at the breakfast-table. \"It isn't what I like, Moggs,\" was the\nfirst word that he spoke when the young politician rose to grasp the\nhand of his future father-in-law.\n\n\"I hope you'll live to like it, Mr. Neefit,\" said Ontario, who, now\nthat he was to have his way in regard to Polly, was prepared to\ndisregard entirely any minor annoyances.\n\n\"I don't know how that may be. I think my girl might have done\nbetter. I told her so, and I just tell you the same. She might a'\ndone a deal better, but women is always restive.\"\n\n\"We like to have our own way about our young men, father,\" said\nPolly, who was standing behind her father's chair.\n\n\"Bother young men,\" said the breeches-maker. After that the interview\npassed off, if not very pleasantly, at least smoothly,--and it was\nunderstood that Mr. Neefit was to abandon that system of persecution\nagainst Ralph Newton, to which his life had been devoted for the last\nfew weeks.\n\nAfter that there was a pretty little correspondence between Polly and\nRalph, with which the story of Polly's maiden life may be presumed to\nbe ended, and which shall be given to the reader, although by doing\nso the facts of our tale will be somewhat anticipated. Polly, with\nher father's permission, communicated the fact of her engagement to\nher former lover.\n\n\n   Hendon, Saturday.\n\n   DEAR SIR,--\n\n   Father thinks it best that I should tell you that I\n   am engaged to marry Mr. Ontario Moggs,--whom you will\n   remember. He is a most respectable tradesman, and stood\n   once for a member of Parliament, and I think he will make\n   me quite happy; and I'm quite sure that's what I'm fitted\n   for.\n\n\nWhether Polly meant that she was fitted to be made happy, or fitted\nto be the wife of a tradesman who stood for Parliament, did not\nappear quite clearly.\n\n\n   There have been things which we are very sorry for, and\n   hope you'll forgive and forget. Father bids me say how\n   sorry he is he broke a figure of a pretty little man in\n   your room. He would get another, only he would not know\n   where to go for it.\n\n   Wishing you always may be happy, believe me to remain,\n\n   Yours most respectfully,\n\n   MARYANNE NEEFIT.\n\n\nRalph's answer was dated about a fortnight afterwards;--\n\n\n   --, Cavendish Square, 1 June, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR POLLY,--\n\n   I hope you will allow me to call you so now for the\n   last time. I am, indeed, happy that you are going to\n   be married. I believe Mr. Moggs to be a most excellent\n   fellow. I hope I may often see him,--and sometimes you.\n   He must allow you to accept a little present which I send\n   you, and never be jealous if you wear it at your waist.\n   The pretty little man that your father broke by accident\n   in my rooms did not signify at all. Pray tell him so from\n   me.\n\n   Believe me to be your very sincere friend,\n\n   RALPH NEWTON.\n\n   I may as well tell you my own secret. I am going to be\n   married, too. The young lady lives in this house, and her\n   name is Augusta Eardham.\n\n\nThis letter was sent by messenger from Cavendish Square, with a very\nhandsome watch and chain. A month afterwards, when he was preparing\nto leave London for Brayboro' Park, he received a little packet, with\na note as follows;--\n\n\n   Linton, Devonshire, Wednesday.\n\n   DEAR MR. NEWTON,--\n\n   I am so much obliged for the watch, and so is Ontario, who\n   will never be jealous, I'm sure. It is a most beautiful\n   thing, and I shall value it, oh! so much. I am very glad\n   you are going to be married, and should have answered\n   before, only I wanted to finish making with my own hand a\n   little chain which I send you. And I hope your sweetheart\n   won't be jealous either. We looked her out in a book, and\n   found she is the daughter of a great gentleman with a\n   title. That is all just as it should be. Ontario sends his\n   respects. We have come down here for the honeymoon.\n\n   I remain, yours very sincerely,\n\n   MARYANNE MOGGS.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV.\n\nMY MARY.\n\n\nBoth the invitations sent by Patience Underwood were accepted, and\nSir Thomas, on the day named, was at home to receive them. Nothing\nhad as yet been done as to the constructing of those cases which he\nso suddenly ordered to be made for his books; and, indeed, Stemm had\nresolved to take the order as meaning nothing. It would not be for\nhim to accelerate his master's departure from Southampton Buildings,\nand he knew enough of the man to be aware that he must have some very\nstrong motive indeed before so great a change could be really made.\nWhen Sir Thomas left Southampton Buildings for Fulham, on the day\nnamed for the dinner, not a word further had been said about packing\nthe books.\n\nThere was no company at the villa besides Sir Thomas, the three\ngirls, and the two young men. As to Clarissa, Patience said not a\nword, even to her father,--that must still be left till time should\nfurther cure the wound that had been made;--but she did venture to\nsuggest, in private with Sir Thomas, that it was a pity that he who\nwas certainly the more worthy of the two Ralphs should not be made\nto understand that others did not think so much of the present\ninferiority of his position in the world as he seemed to think\nhimself.\n\n\"You mean that Mary would take him?\" asked Sir Thomas.\n\n\"Why should she not, if she likes him? He is very good.\"\n\n\"I can't tell him to offer to her, without telling him also that he\nwould be accepted.\"\n\n\"No;--I suppose not,\" said Patience.\n\nNevertheless, Sir Thomas did speak to Ralph Newton before\ndinner,--stuttering and muttering, and only half finishing his\nsentence. \"We had a correspondence once, Mr. Newton. I dare say you\nremember.\"\n\n\"I remember it very well, Sir Thomas.\"\n\n\"I only wanted to tell you;--you seem to think more about what has\ntaken place,--I mean as to the property,--than we do;--that is, than\nI do.\"\n\n\"It has made a change.\"\n\n\"Yes; of course. But I don't know that a large place like Newton\nis sure to make a man happy. Perhaps you'd like to wash your hands\nbefore dinner.\" Gregory, in the meantime, was walking round the\ngarden with Mary and Clarissa.\n\nThe dinner was very quiet, but pleasant and cheerful. Sir Thomas\ntalked a good deal, and so did Patience. Mary also was at her ease,\nand able to do all that was required of her. Ralph certainly was not\ngay. He was seated next to Clarissa, and spoke a few words now and\nagain; but he was arranging matters in his mind; and Patience, who\nwas observing them all, knew that he was pre-occupied. Clarissa,\nwho now and again would forget her sorrow and revert to her former\nself,--as she had done in the picture-gallery,--could not now, under\nthe eye as it were of her father, her sister, and her old lover,\nforget her troubles. She knew what was expected of her; but she\ncould not do it;--she could not do it at least as yet. Nevertheless,\nPatience, who was the engineer in the present crisis, was upon the\nwhole contented with the way in which things were going.\n\nThe three girls sat with the gentlemen for a quarter of an hour after\nthe decanters were put upon the table, and then withdrew. Sir Thomas\nimmediately began to talk about Newton Priory, and to ask questions\nwhich might interest the parson without, as he thought, hurting the\nfeelings of the disinherited Ralph. This went on for about five\nminutes, during which Gregory was very eloquent about his church and\nhis people, when, suddenly, Ralph rose from his chair and withdrew.\n\"Have I said anything that annoyed him?\" asked Sir Thomas anxiously.\n\n\"It is not that, I think,\" said Gregory.\n\nRalph walked across the passage, opened the door of the drawing-room,\nin which the three girls were at work, walked up to the chair in\nwhich Mary Bonner was sitting, and said something in so low a voice\nthat neither of the sisters heard him.\n\n\"Certainly I will,\" said Mary, rising from her chair. Patience\nglanced round, and could see that the colour, always present in her\ncousin's face, was heightened,--ever so little indeed; but still the\ntell-tale blush had told its tale. Ralph stood for a moment while\nMary moved away to the door, and then followed her without speaking a\nword to the other girls, or bestowing a glance on either of them.\n\n\"He is going to propose to her,\" said Clarissa as soon as the door\nwas shut.\n\n\"No one can be sure,\" said Patience.\n\n\"Only fancy,--asking a girl to go out of the room,--in that brave\nmanner! I shouldn't have gone because I'm a coward; but it's just\nwhat Mary will like.\"\n\n\"Let me get my hat, Mr. Newton,\" said Mary, taking the opportunity to\ntrip up-stairs, though her hat was hanging in the hall. When she was\nin her room she merely stood upright there, for half a minute, in the\nmiddle of the chamber, erect and stiff, with her arms and fingers\nstretched out, thinking how she would behave herself. Half a minute\nsufficed for her to find her clue, and then she came down as quickly\nas her feet would carry her. He had opened the front door, and was\nstanding outside upon the gravel, and there she joined him.\n\n\"I had no other way but this of speaking to you,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't dislike coming out at all,\" she answered. Then there was\nsilence for a moment or two as they walked along into the gloom of\nthe shrubbery. \"I suppose you are going down to Norfolk soon?\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"I do not quite know. I thought of going to-morrow.\"\n\n\"So soon as that?\"\n\n\"But I've got something that I want to settle. I think you must know\nwhat it is.\" Then he paused again, almost as though he expected her\nto confess that she did know. But Mary was well aware that it was not\nfor her to say another word till he had fully explained in most open\ndetail what it was that he desired to settle. \"You know a good deal\nof my history, Miss Newton. When I thought that things were going\nwell with me,--much better than I had ever allowed myself to expect\nin early days, I,--I,--became acquainted with you.\" Again he paused,\nbut she had not a word to say. \"I dare say you were not told, but I\nwrote to your uncle then, asking him whether I might have his consent\nto,--just to ask you to be my wife.\" Again he paused, but after that\nhe hurried on, speaking the words as quickly as he could throw them\nforth from his mouth. \"My father died, and of course that changed\neverything. I told your uncle that all ground for pretension\nthat I might have had before was cut from under me. He knew the\ncircumstances of my birth,--and I supposed that you would know it\nalso.\"\n\nThen she did speak. \"Yes, I did,\" she said.\n\n\"Perhaps I was foolish to think that the property would make a\ndifference. But the truth of it is, I have not got over the feeling,\nand shall never get over it. I love you with all my heart,--and\nthough it be for no good, I must tell you so.\"\n\n\"The property can make no difference,\" she said. \"You ought to have\nknown that, Mr. Newton.\"\n\n\"Ah;--but it does. I tried to tell you the other day something of my\npresent home.\"\n\n\"Yes;--I know you did;--and I remember it all.\"\n\n\"There is nothing more to be said;--only to ask you to share it with\nme.\"\n\nShe walked on with him in silence for a minute; but he said nothing\nmore to press his suit, and certainly it was her turn to speak now.\n\"I will share it with you,\" she said, pressing her arm upon his.\n\n\"My Mary!\"\n\n\"Yes;--your Mary,--if you please.\" Then he took her in his arms, and\npressed her to his bosom, and kissed her lips and forehead, and threw\nback her hat, and put his fingers among her hair. \"Why did you say\nthat the property would make a difference?\" she asked, in a whisper.\nTo this he made no answer, but walked on silently, with his arm round\nher waist, till they came out from among the trees, and stood upon\nthe bank of the river. \"There are people in the boats. You must put\nyour arm down,\" she said.\n\n\"I wonder how you will like to be a farmer's wife?\" he asked.\n\n\"I have not an idea.\"\n\n\"I fear so much that you'll find it rough and hard.\"\n\n\"But I have an idea about something.\" She took his hand, and looked\nup into his face as she continued. \"I have an idea that I shall like\nto be your wife.\" He was in a seventh heaven of happiness, and would\nhave stood there gazing on the river with her all night, if she\nwould have allowed him. At last they walked back into the house\ntogether,--and into the room where the others were assembled, with\nvery little outward show of embarrassment. Mary was the first to\nenter the room, and though she blushed she smiled also, and every one\nknew what had taken place. There was no secret or mystery, and in\nfive minutes her cousins were congratulating her. \"It's all settled\nfor you now,\" said Clarissa laughing.\n\n\"Yes, it's all settled for me now, and I wouldn't have it unsettled\nfor all the world.\"\n\nWhile this was being said in the drawing-room,--being said even in\nthe presence of poor Gregory, who could not but have felt how hard it\nwas for him to behold such bliss, Sir Thomas and Ralph had withdrawn\ninto the opposite room. Ralph began to apologise for his own\nmisfortunes,--his misfortune in having lost the inheritance, his\nmisfortune in being illegitimate; but Sir Thomas soon cut his\napologies short. \"You think a great deal more of it than she does, or\nthan I do,\" said Sir Thomas.\n\n\"If she does not regard it, I will never think of it again,\" said\nRalph. \"My greatest glory in what had been promised me was in\nthinking that it might help to win her.\"\n\n\"You have won her without such help as that,\" said Sir Thomas, with\nhis arm on the young man's shoulder.\n\nThere was another delicious hour in store for him as they sat over\ntheir late tea. \"Do you still think of going to Norfolk to-morrow?\"\nshe said to him, with that composure which in her was so beautiful,\nand, at the same time, so expressive.\n\n\"By an early train in the morning.\"\n\n\"I thought that perhaps you might have stayed another day now.\"\n\n\"I thought that perhaps you might want me to come back again,\" said\nRalph;--\"and, if so, I could make arrangements;--perhaps for a week\nor ten days.\"\n\n\"Do come back,\" she said. \"And do stay.\"\n\nRalph's triumph as he returned that evening to London received\nGregory's fullest sympathy; but still it must have been hard to bear.\nPerhaps his cousin's parting words contained for him some comfort.\n\"Give her a little time, and she will be yours yet. I shall find it\nall out from Mary, and you may be sure we shall help you.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV.\n\nCOOKHAM.\n\n\nWe have been obliged to anticipate in some degree the course of\nour story by the necessity which weighed upon us of completing the\nhistory of Polly Neefit. In regard to her we will only further\nexpress an opinion,--in which we believe that we shall have the\nconcurrence of our readers,--that Mr. Moggs junior had chosen well.\nHer story could not be adequately told without a revelation of that\ncorrespondence, which, while it has explained the friendly manner in\nwhich the Neefit-Newton embarrassments were at last brought to an\nend, has, at the same time, disclosed the future lot in life of our\nhero,--as far as a hero's lot in life may be said to depend on his\nmarriage.\n\nMr. Neefit had been almost heart-broken, because he was not satisfied\nthat his victim was really punished by any of those tortures which\nhis imagination invented, and his energy executed. Even when the\n\"pretty little man\" was smashed, and was, in truth, smashed of malice\nprepense by a swinging blow from Neefit's umbrella, Neefit did not\nfeel satisfied that he would thereby reach his victim's heart. He\ncould project his own mind with sufficient force into the bosom of\nhis enemy to understand that the onions and tobacco consumed in that\nluxurious chamber would cause annoyance;--but he desired more than\nannoyance;--he wanted to tear the very heart-strings of the young man\nwho had, as he thought, so signally outwitted him. He did not believe\nthat he was successful; but, in truth, he did make poor Ralph very\nunhappy. The heir felt himself to be wounded, and could not eat and\ndrink, or walk and talk, or ride in the park, or play billiards at\nhis club, in a manner befitting the owner of Newton Priory. He was\nso injured by Neefit that he became pervious to attacks which would\notherwise have altogether failed in reaching him. Lady Eardham would\nnever have prevailed against him as she did,--conquering by a quick\nrepetition of small blows,--had not all his strength been annihilated\nfor the time by the persecutions of the breeches-maker.\n\nLady Eardham whispered to him as he was taking his departure on the\nevening of the dinner in Cavendish Square. \"Dear Mr. Newton,--just\none word,\" she said, confidentially,--\"that must be a very horrid\nman,\"--alluding to Mr. Neefit.\n\n\"It's a horrid bore, you know, Lady Eardham.\"\n\n\"Just so;--and it makes me feel,--as though I didn't quite know\nwhether something ought not to be done. Would you mind calling at\neleven to-morrow? Of course I shan't tell Sir George,--unless you\nthink he ought to be told.\" Ralph promised that he would call, though\nhe felt at the moment that Lady Eardham was an interfering old fool.\nWhy should she want to do anything; and why should she give even a\nhint as to telling Sir George? As he walked across Hanover Square and\ndown Bond Street to his rooms he did assert to himself plainly that\nthe \"old harridan,\" as he called her, was at work for her second\ngirl, and he shook his head and winked his eye as he thought of\nit. But, even in his solitude, he did not feel strong against Lady\nEardham, and he moved along the pavement oppressed by a half-formed\nconviction that her ladyship would prevail against him. He did not,\nhowever, think that he had any particular objection to Gus Eardham.\nThere was a deal of style about the girl, a merit in which either\nClarissa or Mary would have been sadly deficient. And there could be\nno doubt in this,--that a man in his position ought to marry in his\nown class. The proper thing for him to do was to make the daughter\nof some country gentleman,--or of some nobleman, just as it might\nhappen,--mistress of the Priory. Dear little Clary would hardly have\nknown how to take her place properly down in Hampshire. And then he\nthought for a moment of Polly! Perhaps, after all, fate, fashion, and\nfortune managed marriage for young men better than they could manage\nit for themselves. What a life would his have been had he really\nmarried Polly Neefit! Though he did call Lady Eardham a harridan, he\nresolved that he would keep his promise for the following morning.\n\nLady Eardham when he arrived was mysterious, eulogistic, and\nbeneficent. She was clearly of opinion that something should be done.\n\"You know it is so horrid having these kind of things said.\" And yet\nshe was almost equally strong in opinion that nothing could be done.\n\"You know I wouldn't have my girl's name brought up for all the\nworld;--though why the horrid wretch should have named her I cannot\neven guess.\" The horrid wretch had not, in truth, named any special\nher, though it suited Lady Eardham to presume that allusion had been\nmade to that hope of the flock, that crowning glory of the Eardham\nfamily, that most graceful of the Graces, that Venus certain to\nbe chosen by any Paris, her second daughter, Gus. She went on to\nexplain that were she to tell the story to her son Marmaduke, her\nson Marmaduke would probably kill the breeches-maker. As Marmaduke\nEardham was, of all young men about town, perhaps the most careless,\nthe most indifferent, and the least ferocious, his mother was\nprobably mistaken in her estimate of his resentful feelings. \"As for\nSir George, he would be for taking the law of the wretch for libel,\nand then we should be--! I don't know where we should be then; but my\ndear girl would die.\"\n\nOf course there was nothing done. During the whole interview Lady\nEardham continued to press Neefit's letter under her hand upon the\ntable, as though it was of all documents the most precious. She\nhandled it as though to tear it would be as bad as to tear an\noriginal document bearing the king's signature. Before the interview\nwas over she had locked it up in her desk, as though there were\nsomething in it by which the whole Eardham race might be blessed or\nbanned. And, though she spoke no such word, she certainly gave Ralph\nto understand that by this letter he, Ralph Newton, was in some\nmysterious manner so connected with the secrets, and the interests,\nand the sanctity of the Eardham family, that, whether such connection\nmight be for weal or woe, the Newtons and the Eardhams could never\naltogether free themselves from the link. \"Perhaps you had better\ncome and dine with us in a family way to-morrow,\" said Lady Eardham,\ngiving her invitation as though it must necessarily be tendered, and\nalmost necessarily accepted. Ralph, not thanking her, but taking it\nin the same spirit, said that he would be there at half past seven.\n\"Just ourselves,\" said Lady Eardham, in a melancholy tone, as though\nthey two were doomed to eat family dinners together for ever after.\n\n\"I suppose the property is really his own?\" said Lady Eardham to her\nhusband that afternoon.\n\nSir George was a stout, plethoric gentleman, with a short temper and\nmany troubles. Marmaduke was expensive, and Sir George himself had\nspent money when he was young. The girls, who knew that they had no\nfortunes, expected that everything should be done for them, at least\nduring the period of their natural harvest,--and they were successful\nin having their expectations realised. They demanded that there\nshould be horses to ride, servants to attend them, and dresses to\nwear; and they had horses, servants, and dresses. There were also\nyounger children; and Sir George was quite as anxious as Lady Eardham\nthat his daughters should become wives. \"His own?--of course it's his\nown. Who else should it belong to?\"\n\n\"There was something about that other young man.\"\n\n\"The bastard! It was the greatest sin that ever was thought of to\npalm such a fellow as that off on the county;--but it didn't come to\nanything.\"\n\n\"I'm told, too, he has been very extravagant. No doubt he did get\nmoney from the,--the tailor who wants to make him marry his\ndaughter.\"\n\n\"A flea-bite,\" said Sir George. \"Don't you bother about that.\" Thus\nauthorised, Lady Eardham went to the work with a clear conscience and\na good will.\n\nOn the next morning Ralph received by post an envelope from Sir\nThomas Underwood containing a letter addressed to him from Mr.\nNeefit. \"Sir,--Are you going to make your ward act honourable to me\nand my daughter?--Yours, respectful, THOMAS NEEFIT.\" The reader will\nunderstand that this was prior to Polly's triumph over her father.\nRalph uttered a deep curse, and made up his mind that he must either\nthrow himself entirely among the Eardhams, or else start at once for\nthe Rocky Mountains. He dined in Cavendish Square that day, and again\ntook Gus down to dinner.\n\n\"I'm very glad to see you here,\" said Sir George, when they two\nwere alone together after the ladies had left them. Sir George, who\nhad been pressed upon home service because of the necessity of the\noccasion, was anxious to get off to his club.\n\n\"You are very kind, Sir George,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"We shall be delighted to see you at Brayboro', if you'll come for\na week in September and look at the girls' horses. They say you're\nquite a pundit about horseflesh.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"You'll like to go up to the girls now, I dare say, and I've got\nan engagement.\" Then Sir George rang the bell for a cab, and Ralph\nwent up-stairs to the girls. Emily had taken herself away; Josephine\nwas playing b\u00c3\u00a9sique with her mother, and Gus was thus forced into\nconversation with the young man. \"B\u00c3\u00a9sique is so stupid,\" said Gus.\n\n\"Horribly stupid,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"And what do you like, Mr. Newton?\"\n\n\"I like you,\" said Ralph. But he did not propose on that evening.\nLady Eardham thought he ought to have done so, and was angry with\nhim. It was becoming almost a matter of necessity with her that young\nmen should not take much time. Emily was twenty-seven, and Josephine\nwas a most difficult child to manage,--not pretty, but yet giving\nherself airs and expecting everything. She had refused a clergyman\nwith a very good private fortune, greatly to her mother's sorrow. And\nGus had already been the source of much weary labour. Four eldest\nsons had been brought to her feet and been allowed to slip away; and\nall, as Lady Eardham said, because Gus would \"joke\" with other young\nmen, while the one man should have received all her pleasantry. Emily\nwas quite of opinion that young Newton should by no means have been\nallotted to Gus. Lady Eardham, who had played b\u00c3\u00a9sique with an energy\nagainst which Josephine would have mutinied but that some promise was\nmade as to Marshall and Snelgrove, could see from her little table\nthat young Newton was neither abject nor triumphant in his manner.\nHe had not received nor had he even asked when he got up to take his\nleave. Lady Eardham could have boxed his ears; but she smiled upon\nhim ineffably, pressed his hand, and in the most natural way in the\nworld alluded to some former allusion about riding and the park.\n\n\"I shan't ride to-morrow,\" said Gus, with her back turned to them.\n\n\"Do,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"No; I shan't.\"\n\n\"You see what she says, Lady Eardham,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"You promised you would before dinner, my dear,\" said Lady Eardham,\n\"and you ought not to change your mind. If you'll be good-natured\nenough to come, two of them will go.\" Of course it was understood\nthat he would come.\n\n\"Nothing on earth, mamma, shall ever induce me to play b\u00c3\u00a9sique\nagain,\" said Josephine, yawning.\n\n\"It's not worse for you than for me,\" said the old lady sharply.\n\n\"But it isn't fair,\" said Josephine, who was supposed to be the\nclever one of the family. \"I may have to play my b\u00c3\u00a9sique a quarter of\na century hence.\"\n\n\"He's an insufferable puppy,\" said Emily, who had come into the room,\nand had been pretending to be reading.\n\n\"That's because he don't bark at your bidding, my dear,\" said Gus.\n\n\"It doesn't seem that he means to bark at yours,\" said the elder\nsister.\n\n\"If you go on like that, girls, I'll tell your papa, and we'll go to\nBrayboro' at once. It's too bad, and I won't bear it.\"\n\n\"What would you have me do?\" said Gus, standing up for herself\nfiercely.\n\nGus did ride, and so did Josephine, and there was a servant with them\nof course. It had been Emily's turn,--there being two horses for the\nthree girls; but Gus had declared that no good could come if Emily\nwent;--and Emily's going had been stopped by parental authority.\n\"You do as you're bid,\" said Sir George, \"or you'll get the worst of\nit.\" Sir George suffered much from gout, and had obtained from the\nill-temper which his pangs produced a mastery over his daughters\nwhich some fathers might have envied.\n\n\"You behaved badly to me last night, Mr. Newton,\" said Gus, on\nhorseback. There was another young man riding with Josephine, so that\nthe lovers were alone together.\n\n\"Behaved badly to you?\"\n\n\"Yes, you did, and I felt it very much,--very much indeed.\"\n\n\"How did I behave badly?\"\n\n\"If you do not know, I'm sure that I shall not tell you.\" Ralph did\nnot know;--but he went home from his ride an unengaged man, and may\nperhaps have been thought to behave badly on that occasion also.\n\nBut Lady Eardham, though she was sometimes despondent and often\ncross, was gifted with perseverance. A picnic party up the river\nfrom Maidenhead to Cookham was got up for the 30th of May, and Ralph\nNewton of course was there. Just at that time the Neefit persecution\nwas at its worst. Letters directed by various hands came to him\ndaily, and in all of them he was asked when he meant to be on the\nsquare. He knew the meaning of that picnic as well as does the\nreader,--as well as did Lady Eardham; but it had come to that with\nhim that he was willing to yield. It cannot exactly be said for him\nthat out of all the feminine worth that he had seen, he himself had\nchosen Gus Eardham as being the most worthy,--or even that he had\nchosen her as being to him the most charming. But it was evident\nto him that he must get married, and why not to her as well as to\nanother? She had style, plenty of style; and, as he told himself,\nstyle for a man in his position was more than anything else. It can\nhardly be said that he had made up his mind to offer to her before\nhe started for Cookham,--though doubtless through all the remaining\nyears of his life he would think that his mind had been so\nfixed,--but he had concluded, that if she were thrown at his head\nvery hard, he might as well take her. \"I don't think he ever does\ndrink champagne,\" said Lady Eardham, talking it all over with Gus on\nthe morning of the picnic.\n\nAt Cookham there is, or was, a punt,--perhaps there always will be\none, kept there for such purposes;--and into this punt either Gus was\ntempted by Ralph, or Ralph by Gus. \"My darling child, what are you\ndoing?\" shouted Lady Eardham from the bank.\n\n\"Mr. Newton says he can take me over,\" said Gus, standing up in the\npunt, shaking herself with a pretty tremor.\n\n\"Don't, Mr. Newton; pray don't!\" cried Lady Eardham, with affected\nhorror.\n\nLunch was over, or dinner, as it might be more properly called, and\nRalph had taken a glass or two of champagne. He was a man whom no one\nhad ever seen the \"worse for wine;\" but on this occasion that which\nmight have made others drunk had made him bold. \"I will not let you\nout, Gus, till you have promised me one thing,\" said Ralph.\n\n\"What is the one thing?\"\n\n\"That you will go with me everywhere, always.\"\n\n\"You must let me out,\" said Gus.\n\n\"But will you promise?\" Then Gus promised; and Lady Eardham, with\ntrue triumph in her voice, was able to tell her husband on the\nfollowing morning that the cost of the picnic had not been thrown\naway.\n\nOn the next morning early Ralph was in the square. Neither when\nhe went to bed at night, nor when he got up in the morning, did\nhe regret what he had done. The marriage would be quite a proper\nmarriage. Nobody could say that he had been mercenary, and he hated a\nmercenary feeling in marriages. Nobody could say that the match was\nbeneath him, and all people were agreed that Augusta Eardham was a\nvery fine girl. As to her style, there could be no doubt about it.\nThere might be some little unpleasantness in communicating the fact\nto the Underwoods,--but that could be done by letter. After all, it\nwould signify very little to him what Sir Thomas thought about him.\nSir Thomas might think him feeble; but he himself knew very well that\nthere had been no feebleness in it. His circumstances had been very\npeculiar, and he really believed that he had made the best of them.\nAs Squire of Newton, he was doing quite the proper thing in marrying\nthe daughter of a baronet out of the next county. With a light heart,\na pleased face, and with very well got-up morning apparel, Ralph\nknocked the next morning at the door in Cavendish Square, and asked\nfor Sir George Eardham. \"I'll just run up-stairs for a second,\" said\nRalph, when he was told that Sir George was in the small parlour.\n\nHe did run up-stairs, and in three minutes had been kissed by Lady\nEardham and all her daughters. At this moment Gus was the \"dearest\nchild\" and the \"best love of a thing\" with all of them. Even Emily\nremembered how pleasant it might be to have a room at Newton Priory,\nand then success always gives a new charm.\n\n\"Have you seen Sir George?\" asked Lady Eardham.\n\n\"Not as yet;--they said he was there, but I had to come up and see\nher first, you know.\"\n\n\"Go down to him,\" said Lady Eardham, patting her prey on the back\ntwice. \"When you've daughters of your own, you'll expect to be\nconsulted.\"\n\n\"She couldn't have done better, my dear fellow,\" said Sir George,\nwith kind, genial cordiality. \"She couldn't have done better, to my\nthinking, even with a peerage. I like you, and I like your family,\nand I like your property; and she's yours with all my heart. A better\ngirl never lived.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Sir George.\"\n\n\"She has no money, you know.\"\n\n\"I don't care about money, Sir George.\"\n\n\"My dear boy, she's yours with all my heart; and I hope you'll make\neach other happy.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI.\n\nRALPH NEWTON IS BOWLED AWAY.\n\n\nA day or two after his engagement, Ralph did write his letter to Sir\nThomas, and found when the moment came that the task was difficult.\nBut he wrote it. The thing had to be done, and there was nothing to\nbe gained by postponing it.\n\n\n   ---- Club, June 2, 186--.\n\n   MY DEAR SIR THOMAS,--\n\n   You will, I hope, be glad to hear that I am engaged to be\n   married to Augusta Eardham, the second daughter of Sir\n   George Eardham, of Brayboro' Park, in Berkshire. Of course\n   you will know the name, and I rather think you were in\n   the House when Sir George sat for Berkshire. Augusta\n   has got no money, but I have not been placed under the\n   disagreeable necessity of looking out for a rich wife. I\n   believe we shall be married about the end of August. As\n   the ceremony will take place down at Brayboro', I fear\n   that I cannot expect that you or Patience and Clarissa\n   should come so far. Pray tell them my news, with my best\n   love.\n\n   Yours, most grateful for all your long kindness,\n\n   RALPH NEWTON.\n\n   I am very sorry that you should have been troubled by\n   letters from Mr. Neefit. The matter has been arranged at\n   last.\n\n\nThe letter when done was very simple, but it took him some time, and\nmuch consideration. Should he or should he not allude to his former\nloves? It was certainly much easier to write his letter without any\nsuch allusion, and he did so.\n\nAbout a week after this Sir Thomas went home to Fulham, and took\nthe letter with him. \"Clary,\" he said, taking his youngest daughter\naffectionately by the waist, when he found himself alone with her.\n\"I've got a piece of news for you.\"\n\n\"For me, papa?\"\n\n\"Well, for all of us. Somebody is going to be married. Who do you\nthink it is?\"\n\n\"Not Ralph Newton?\" said Clarissa, with a little start.\n\n\"Yes, Ralph Newton.\"\n\n\"How quick he arranges things!\" said Clarissa. There was some little\nemotion, just a quiver, and a quick rush of blood into her cheeks,\nwhich, however, left them just as quickly.\n\n\"Yes;--he is quick.\"\n\n\"Who is it, papa?\"\n\n\"A very proper sort of person,--the daughter of a Berkshire baronet.\"\n\n\"But what is her name?\"\n\n\"Augusta Eardham.\"\n\n\"Augusta Eardham. I hope he'll be happy, papa. We've known him a long\ntime.\"\n\n\"I think he will be happy;--what people call happy. He is not\ngifted,--or cursed, as it may be,--with fine feelings, and is what\nperhaps may be called thick-skinned; but he will love his own wife\nand children. I don't think he will be a spendthrift now that he has\nplenty to spend, and he is not subject to what the world calls vices.\nI shouldn't wonder if he becomes a prosperous and most respectable\ncountry gentleman, and quite a model to his neighbours.\"\n\n\"It doesn't seem to matter much;--does it?\" said Clarissa, when she\ntold the story to Mary and Patience.\n\n\"What doesn't matter?\" asked Mary.\n\n\"Whether a man cares for the girl he's going to marry, or doesn't\ncare at all. Ralph Newton cannot care very much for Miss Eardham.\"\n\n\"I think it matters very much,\" said Mary.\n\n\"Perhaps, after all, he'll be just as fond of his wife, in a way,\nas though he had been making love to her,--oh, for years,\" said\nClarissa. This was nearly all that was said at the villa, though, no\ndoubt, poor Clary had many thoughts on the matter, in her solitary\nrambles along the river. That picture of the youth, as he lay upon\nthe lawn, looking up into her eyes, and telling her that she was\ndear to him, could not easily be effaced from her memory. Sir Thomas\nbefore this had written his congratulations to Ralph. They had been\nvery short, and in them no allusion had been made to the young ladies\nat Popham Villa.\n\nIn the meantime Ralph was as happy as the day was long, and delighted\nwith his lot in life. For some weeks previous to his offer he had\nbeen aware that Lady Eardham had been angling for him as for a fish,\nthat he had been as a prey to her and to her daughter, and that it\nbehoved him to amuse himself without really taking the hook between\nhis gills. He had taken the hook, and now had totally forgotten all\nthose former notions of his in regard to a prey, and a fish, and a\nmercenary old harridan of a mother. He had no sooner been kissed all\nround by the women, and paternally blessed by Sir George, than he\nthought that he had exercised a sound judgment, and had with true\nwisdom arranged to ally himself with just the woman most fit to be\nhis wife, and the future mistress of Newton Priory. He was proud,\nindeed, of his success, when he read the paragraph in the \"Morning\nPost,\" announcing as a fact that the alliance had been arranged, and\nwas again able to walk about among his comrades as one of those who\nmake circumstances subject to them, rather than become subject to\ncircumstances. His comrades, no doubt, saw the matter in another\nlight. \"By Jove,\" said Pretty Poll at his club, \"there's Newton been\nand got caught by old Eardham after all. The girl has been running\nten years, and been hawked about like a second-class race-horse.\"\n\n\"Yes, poor fellow,\" said Captain Fooks. \"Neefit has done that\nfor him. Ralph for a while was so knocked off his pins by the\nbreeches-maker, that he didn't know where to look for shelter.\"\n\nWhether marriages should be made in heaven or on earth, must be\na matter of doubt to observers;--whether, that is, men and women\nare best married by chance, which I take to be the real fashion of\nheaven-made marriages; or should be brought into that close link and\nloving bondage to each other by thought, selection, and decision.\nThat the heavenly mode prevails the oftenest there can hardly be a\ndoubt. It takes years to make a friendship; but a marriage may be\nsettled in a week,--in an hour. If you desire to go into partnership\nwith a man in business, it is an essential necessity that you should\nknow your partner; that he be honest,--or dishonest, if such be your\nown tendency,--industrious, instructed in the skill required, and of\nhabits of life fit for the work to be done. But into partnerships for\nlife,--of a kind much closer than any business partnership,--men rush\nwithout any preliminary inquiries. Some investigation and anxiety as\nto means there may be, though in this respect the ordinary parlance\nof the world endows men with more caution, or accuses them of more\ngreed than they really possess. But in other respects everything is\ntaken for granted. Let the woman, if possible, be pretty;--or if\nnot pretty, let her have style. Let the man, if possible, not be a\nfool; or if a fool, let him not show his folly too plainly. As for\nknowledge of character, none is possessed, and none is wanted. The\nyoung people meet each other in their holiday dresses, on holiday\noccasions, amidst holiday pleasures,--and the thing is arranged. Such\nmatches may be said to be heaven-made.\n\nIt is a fair question whether they do not answer better than those\nwhich have less of chance,--or less of heaven,--in their manufacture.\nIf it be needful that a man and woman take five years to learn\nwhether they will suit each other as husband and wife, and that then,\nat the end of the five years, they find that they will not suit, the\nfreshness of the flower would be gone before it could be worn in the\nbutton-hole. There are some leaps which you must take in the dark, if\nyou mean to jump at all. We can all understand well that a wise man\nshould stand on the brink and hesitate; but we can understand also\nthat a very wise man should declare to himself that with no possible\namount of hesitation could certainty be achieved. Let him take the\njump or not take it,--but let him not presume to think that he can\nso jump as to land himself in certain bliss. It is clearly God's\nintention that men and women should live together, and therefore let\nthe leap in the dark be made.\n\nNo doubt there had been very much of heaven in Ralph Newton's last\nchoice. It may be acknowledged that in lieu of choosing at all, he\nhad left the matter altogether to heaven. Some attempt he had made at\nchoosing,--in reference to Mary Bonner; but he had found the attempt\nsimply to be troublesome and futile. He had spoken soft, loving words\nto Clarissa, because she herself had been soft and lovable. Nature\nhad spoken,--as she does when the birds sing to each other. Then,\nagain, while suffering under pecuniary distress he had endeavoured\nto make himself believe that Polly Neefit was just the wife for him.\nThen, amidst the glories of his emancipation from thraldom, he had\nseen Mary Bonner,--and had actually, after a fashion, made a choice\nfor himself. His choice had brought upon him nothing but disgrace\nand trouble. Now he had succumbed at the bidding of heaven and Lady\nEardham, and he was about to be provided with a wife exactly suited\nfor him. It may be said at the same time that Augusta Eardham was\nequally lucky. She also had gotten all that she ought to have wanted,\nhad she known what to want. They were both of them incapable of what\nmen and women call love when they speak of love as a passion linked\nwith romance. And in one sense they were cold-hearted. Neither of\nthem was endowed with the privilege of pining because another person\nhad perished. But each of them was able to love a mate, when assured\nthat that mate must continue to be mate, unless separation should\ncome by domestic earthquake. They had hearts enough for paternal and\nmaternal duties, and would probably agree in thinking that any geese\nwhich Providence might send them were veritable swans. Bickerings\nthere might be, but they would be bickerings without effect; and\nRalph Newton, of Newton, would probably so live with this wife of his\nbosom, that they, too, might lie at last pleasantly together in the\nfamily vault, with the record of their homely virtues visible to the\nsurvivors of the parish on the same tombstone. The means by which\neach of them would have arrived at these blessings would not redound\nto the credit of either; but the blessings would be there, and it may\nbe said of their marriage, as of many such marriages, that it was\nmade in heaven, and was heavenly.\n\nThe marriage was to take place early in September, and the first\nweek in August was passed by Sir George and Lady Eardham and their\ntwo younger daughters at Newton Priory. On the 14th Ralph was to be\nallowed to run down to the moors just for one week, and then he was\nto be back, passing between Newton and Brayboro', signing deeds and\nsettlements, preparing for their wedding tour, and obedient in all\nthings to Eardham influences. It did occur to him that it would\nbe proper that he should go down to Fulham to see his old friends\nonce before his marriage; but he felt that such a visit would be\nto himself very unpleasant, and therefore he assured himself, and\nmoreover made himself believe, that, if he abstained from the visit,\nhe would abstain because it would be unpleasant to them. He did\nabstain. But he did call at the chambers in Southampton Buildings; he\ncalled, however, at an hour in which he knew that Sir Thomas would\nnot be visible, and made no second pressing request to Stemm for the\nprivilege of entrance.\n\nHe had great pride in showing his house and park and estate to the\nEardhams, and had some delicious rambles with his Augusta through the\nshrubberies and down by the little brook. Ralph had an enjoyment in\nthe prettiness of nature, and Augusta was clever enough to simulate\nthe feeling. He was a little annoyed, perhaps, when he found that the\nbeauty of her morning dresses did not admit of her sitting upon the\ngrass or leaning against gates, and once expressed an opinion that\nshe need not be so particular about her gloves in this the hour of\ntheir billing and cooing. Augusta altogether declined to remove her\ngloves in a place swarming, as she said, with midges, or to undergo\nany kind of embrace while adorned with that sweetest of all hats,\nwhich had been purchased for his especial delight. But in other\nrespects she was good humoured, and tried to please him. She learned\nthe names of all his horses, and was beginning to remember those\nof his tenants. She smiled upon Gregory, and behaved with a pretty\ndecorum when the young parson showed her his church. Altogether her\nbehaviour was much better than might have been expected from the\ntraining to which she had been subjected during her seven seasons in\nLondon. Lord Polperrow wronged her greatly when he said that she had\nbeen \"running\" for ten years.\n\nThere was a little embarrassment in Ralph's first interview with\nGregory. He had given his brother notice of his engagement by letter\nas soon as he had been accepted, feeling that any annoyance coming to\nhim, might be lessened in that way. Unfortunately he had spoken to\nhis brother in what he now felt to have been exaggerated terms of his\npassion for Mary Bonner, and he himself was aware that that malady\nhad been quickly cured. \"I suppose the news startled you?\" he had\nsaid, with a forced laugh, as soon as he met his brother.\n\n\"Well;--yes, a little. I did not know that you were so intimate with\nthem.\"\n\n\"The truth is, I had thought a deal about the matter, and I had come\nto see how essential it was for the interests of us all that I should\nmarry into our own set. The moment I saw Augusta I felt that she was\nexactly the girl to make me happy. She is very handsome. Don't you\nthink so?\"\n\n\"Certainly.\"\n\n\"And then she has just the style which, after all, does go so far.\nThere's nothing dowdy about her. A dowdy woman would have killed me.\nShe attracted me from the first moment; and, by Jove, old fellow, I\ncan assure you it was mutual. I am the happiest fellow alive, and\nI don't think there is anything I envy anybody.\" In all this Ralph\nbelieved that he was speaking the simple truth.\n\n\"I hope you'll be happy, with all my heart,\" said Gregory.\n\n\"I am sure I shall;--and so will you if you will ask that little puss\nonce again. I believe in my heart she loves you.\" Gregory, though he\nhad been informed of his brother's passion for Mary, had never been\ntold of that other passion for Clarissa; and Ralph could therefore\nspeak of ground for hope in that direction without uncomfortable\ntwinges.\n\nThere did occur during this fortnight one or two little matters,\njust sufficiently laden with care to ruffle the rose-leaves of our\nhero's couch. Lady Eardham thought that both the dining-room and\ndrawing-room should be re-furnished, that a bow-window should be\nthrown out to the breakfast-parlour, and that a raised conservatory\nshould be constructed into which Augusta's own morning sitting-room\nup-stairs might be made to open. Ralph gave way about the furniture\nwith a good grace, but he thought that the bow-window would disfigure\nthe house, and suggested that the raised conservatory would\ncost money. Augusta thought the bow-window was the very thing\nfor the house, and Lady Eardham knew as a fact that a similar\nconservatory,--the sweetest thing in the world,--which she had seen\nat Lord Rosebud's had cost almost absolutely nothing. And if anything\nwas well-known in gardening it was this, that the erection of such\nconservatories was a positive saving in garden expenses. The men\nworked under cover during the rainy days, and the hot-water served\nfor domestic as well as horticultural purposes. There was some debate\nand a little heat, and the matter was at last referred to Sir George.\nHe voted against Ralph on both points, and the orders were given.\n\nThen there was the more important question of the settlements. Of\ncourse there were to be settlements, in the arrangement of which\nRalph was to give everything and to get nothing. With high-handed\nmagnanimity he had declared that he wanted no money, and therefore\nthe trifle which would have been adjudged to be due to Gus was\nretained to help her as yet less fortunate sisters. In truth\nMarmaduke at this time was so expensive that Sir George was obliged\nto be a little hard. Why, however, he should have demanded out of\nsuch a property as that of Newton a jointure of \u00c2\u00a34,000 a year, with\na house to be found either in town or country as the widow might\ndesire, on behalf of a penniless girl, no one acting in the Newton\ninterest could understand, unless Sir George might have thought that\nthe sum to be ultimately obtained might depend in some degree on that\ndemanded. Had he known Mr. Carey he would probably not have subjected\nhimself to the rebuke which he received.\n\nRalph, when the sum was first named to him by Sir George's lawyer,\nwho came down purposely to Newton, looked very blank, and said\nthat he had not anticipated any arrangement so destructive to the\nproperty. The lawyer pointed out that there was unfortunately no\ndowager's house provided; that the property would not be destroyed\nas the dower would only be an annuity; that ladies now were more\nliberally treated in this matter than formerly;--and that the\nsuggestion was quite the usual thing. \"You don't suppose I mean my\ndaughter to be starved?\" said Sir George, upon whom gout was then\ncoming. Ralph plucked up spirit and answered him. \"Nor do I intend\nthat your daughter, sir, should be starved.\" \"Dear Ralph, do be\nliberal to the dear girl,\" said Lady Eardham afterwards, caressing\nour hero in the solitude of her bed-room. Mr. Carey, however,\narranged the whole matter very quickly. The dower must be \u00c2\u00a32,000, out\nof which the widow must find her own house. Sir George must be well\naware, said Mr. Carey, that the demand made was preposterous. Sir\nGeorge said one or two very nasty things; but the dower as fixed by\nMr. Carey was accepted, and then everything smiled again.\n\nWhen the Eardhams were leaving Newton the parting between Augusta\nand her lover was quite pretty. \"Dear Gus,\" he said, \"when next I am\nhere, you will be my own, own wife,\" and he kissed her. \"Dear Ralph,\"\nshe said, \"when next I am here, you will be my own, own husband,\" and\nkissed him; \"but we have Como, and Florence, and Rome, and Naples to\ndo before that;--and won't that be nice?\"\n\n\"It will be very nice to be anywhere with you,\" said the lover.\n\n\"And mind you have your coat made just as I told you,\" said Augusta.\nSo they parted.\n\nEarly in September they were married with great \u00c3\u00a9clat at Brayboro',\nand Lady Eardham spared nothing on the occasion. It was her first\nmaternal triumph, and all the country round was made to know of her\nsuccess. The Newtons had been at Newton for--she did not know how\nmany hundred years. In her zeal she declared that the estate had been\nin the same hands from long before the Conquest. \"There's no title,\"\nshe said to her intimate friend, Lady Wiggham, \"but there's that\nwhich is better than a title. We're mushrooms to the Newtons, you\nknow. We only came into Berkshire in the reign of Henry VIII.\" As the\nWigghams had only come into Buckinghamshire in the reign of George\nIV., Lady Wiggham, had she known the facts, would probably have\nreminded her dear friend that the Eardhams had in truth first been\nheard of in those parts in the time of Queen Anne,--the original\nEardham having made his money in following Marlborough's army. But\nLady Wiggham had not studied the history of the county gentry. The\nwedding went off very well, and the bride and bridegroom were bowled\naway to the nearest station with four grey post-horses from Reading\nin a manner that was truly delightful to Lady Eardham's motherly\nfeelings.\n\nAnd with the same grey horses shall the happy bride and bridegroom\nbe bowled out of our sight also. The writer of this story feels\nthat some apology is due to his readers for having endeavoured\nto entertain them so long with the adventures of one of whom it\ncertainly cannot be said that he was fit to be delineated as a hero.\nIt is thought by many critics that in the pictures of imaginary life\nwhich novelists produce for the amusement, and possibly for the\ninstruction of their readers, none should be put upon the canvas but\nthe very good, who by their noble thoughts and deeds may lead others\nto nobility, or the very bad, who by their declared wickedness will\nmake iniquity hideous. How can it be worth one's while, such critics\nwill say,--the writer here speaks of all critical readers, and not\nof professional critics,--how can it be worth our while to waste our\nimaginations, our sympathies, and our time upon such a one as Ralph,\nthe heir of the Newton property? The writer, acknowledging the force\nof these objections, and confessing that his young heroes of romance\nare but seldom heroic, makes his apology as follows.\n\nThe reader of a novel,--who has doubtless taken the volume up simply\nfor amusement, and who would probably lay it down did he suspect\nthat instruction, like a snake in the grass, like physic beneath the\nsugar, was to be imposed upon him,--requires from his author chiefly\nthis, that he shall be amused by a narrative in which elevated\nsentiment prevails, and gratified by being made to feel that the\nelevated sentiments described are exactly his own. When the heroine\nis nobly true to her lover, to her friend, or to her duty, through\nall persecution, the girl who reads declares to herself that she also\nwould have been a Jeannie Deans had Fate and Fortune given her an\nEffie as a sister. The bald-headed old lawyer,--for bald-headed old\nlawyers do read novels,--who interests himself in the high-minded,\nself-devoting chivalry of a Colonel Newcombe, believes he would have\nacted as did the Colonel had he been so tried. What youth in his\nimagination cannot be as brave, and as loving, though as hopeless\nin his love, as Harry Esmond? Alas, no one will wish to be as\nwas Ralph Newton! But for one Harry Esmond, there are fifty Ralph\nNewtons,--five hundred and fifty of them; and the very youth whose\nbosom glows with admiration as he reads of Harry,--who exults in the\nidea that as Harry did, so would he have done,--lives as Ralph lived,\nis less noble, less persistent, less of a man even than was Ralph\nNewton.\n\nIt is the test of a novel writer's art that he conceals his\nsnake-in-the-grass; but the reader may be sure that it is always\nthere. No man or woman with a conscience,--no man or woman with\nintellect sufficient to produce amusement, can go on from year\nto year spinning stories without the desire of teaching; with no\nambition of influencing readers for their good. Gentle readers, the\nphysic is always beneath the sugar, hidden or unhidden. In writing\nnovels we novelists preach to you from our pulpits, and are keenly\nanxious that our sermons shall not be inefficacious. Inefficacious\nthey are not, unless they be too badly preached to obtain attention.\nInjurious they will be unless the lessons taught be good lessons.\n\nWhat a world this would be if every man were a Harry Esmond, or every\nwoman a Jeannie Deans! But then again, what a world if every woman\nwere a Beckie Sharp and every man a Varney or a Barry Lyndon! Of\nVarneys and Harry Esmonds there are very few. Human nature, such as\nit is, does not often produce them. The portraits of such virtues\nand such vices serve no doubt to emulate and to deter. But are no\nother portraits necessary? Should we not be taught to see the men\nand women among whom we really live,--men and women such as we are\nourselves,--in order that we should know what are the exact failings\nwhich oppress ourselves, and thus learn to hate, and if possible\nto avoid in life the faults of character which in life are hardly\nvisible, but which in portraiture of life can be made to be so\ntransparent.\n\nRalph Newton did nothing, gentle reader, which would have caused\nthee greatly to grieve for him, nothing certainly which would have\ncaused thee to repudiate him, had he been thy brother. And gentlest,\nsweetest reader, had he come to thee as thy lover, with sufficient\nprotest of love, and with all his history written in his hand, would\nthat have caused thee to reject his suit? Had he been thy neighbour,\nthou well-to-do reader, with a house in the country, would he not\nhave been welcome to thy table? Wouldst thou have avoided him at\nhis club, thou reader from the West-end? Has he not settled himself\nrespectably, thou grey-haired, novel-reading paterfamilias, thou\nmaterfamilias, with daughters of thine own to be married? In life\nwould he have been held to have disgraced himself,--except in the\nvery moment in which he seemed to be in danger? Nevertheless, the\nfaults of a Ralph Newton, and not the vices of a Varney or a Barry\nLyndon are the evils against which men should in these days be taught\nto guard themselves;--which women also should be made to hate. Such\nis the writer's apology for his very indifferent hero, Ralph the\nHeir.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII.\n\nCLARISSA'S FATE.\n\n\nIn the following October, while Newton of Newton and his bride\nwere making themselves happy amidst the glories of Florence, she\nwith her finery from Paris, and he with a newly-acquired taste for\nMichael Angelo and the fine arts generally, Gregory the parson again\nwent up to London. He had, of course, \"assisted\" at his brother's\nmarriage,--in which the heavy burden of the ceremony was imposed\non the shoulders of a venerable dean, who was related to Lady\nEardham,--and had since that time been all alone at his parsonage.\nOccasionally he had heard of the Underwoods from Ralph Newton of\nBeamingham, whose wedding had been postponed till Beamingham Hall had\nbeen made fit for its mistress; and from what he had heard Gregory\nwas induced,--hardly to hope,--but to dream it to be possible\nthat even yet he might prevail in love. An idea had grown upon\nhim, springing from various sources, that Clarissa had not been\nindifferent to his brother, and that this feeling on her part had\nmarred, and must continue to mar, his own happiness. He never\nbelieved that there had been fault on his brother's part; but still,\nif Clarissa had been so wounded,--he could hardly hope,--and perhaps\nshould not even wish,--that she would consent to share with him his\nparsonage in the close neighbourhood of his brother's house. During\nall that September he told himself that the thing should be over, and\nhe began to teach himself,--to try to teach himself,--that celibacy\nwas the state in which a clergyman might best live and do his duty.\nBut the lesson had not gone far with him before he shook himself, and\ndetermined that he would try yet once again. If there had been such\na wound, why should not the wound be cured? Clarissa was at any rate\ntrue. She would not falsely promise him a heart, when it was beyond\nher power to give it. In October, therefore, he went again up to\nLondon.\n\nThe cases for packing the books had not even yet been made, and Sir\nThomas was found in Southampton Buildings. The first words had, of\ncourse, reference to the absent Squire. The squire of one's parish,\nthe head of one's family, and one's elder brother, when the three\nare united in the same personage, will become important to one, even\nthough the personage himself be not heroic. Ralph had written home\ntwice, and everything was prospering with him. Sir Thomas, who had\nbecome tired of his late ward, and who had thought worse of the\nEardham marriage than the thing deserved, was indifferent to the joys\nof the Italian honeymoon. \"They'll do very well, no doubt,\" said Sir\nThomas. \"I was delighted to learn that Augusta bore her journey so\nwell,\" said Gregory. \"Augustas always do bear their journeys well,\"\nsaid Sir Thomas; \"though sometimes, I fancy, they find the days a\nlittle too long.\"\n\nBut his tone was very different when Gregory asked his leave to make\none more attempt at Popham Villa. \"I only hope you may succeed,--for\nher sake, as well as for your own,\" said Sir Thomas. But when he was\nasked as to the parson's chance of success, he declared that he could\nsay nothing. \"She is changed, I think, from what she used to be,--is\nmore thoughtful, perhaps, and less giddy. It may be that such\nchange will turn her towards you.\" \"I would not have her changed in\nanything,\" said Gregory,--\"except in her feelings towards myself.\"\n\nHe had been there twice or thrice before he found what he thought to\nbe an opportunity fit for the work that he had on hand. And yet both\nPatience and Mary did for him and for her all that they knew how\nto do. But in such a matter it is so hard to act without seeming\nto act! She who can manoeuvre on such a field without displaying\nher manoeuvres is indeed a general! No man need ever attempt the\nexecution of a task so delicate. Mary and Patience put their heads\ntogether, and resolved that they would say nothing. Nor did they\nmanifestly take steps to leave the two alone together. It was a\nquestion with them, especially with Patience, whether the lover had\nnot come too soon.\n\nBut Clarissa at last attacked her sister. \"Patience,\" she said, \"why\ndo you not speak to me?\"\n\n\"Not speak to you, Clary?\"\n\n\"Not a word,--about that which is always on my mind. You have not\nmentioned Ralph Newton's name once since his marriage.\"\n\n\"I have thought it better not to mention it. Why should I mention\nit?\"\n\n\"If you think that it would pain me, you are mistaken. It pains me\nmore that you should think that I could not bear it. He was welcome\nto his wife.\"\n\n\"I know you wish him well, Clary.\"\n\n\"Well! Oh, yes, I wish him well. No doubt he will be happy with her.\nShe is fit for him, and I was not. He did quite right.\"\n\n\"He is not half so good as his brother,\" said Patience.\n\n\"Certainly he is not so good as his brother. Men, of course, will be\ndifferent. But it is not always the best man that one likes the best.\nIt ought to be so, perhaps.\"\n\n\"I know which I like the best,\" said Patience. \"Oh, Clary, if you\ncould but bring yourself to love him.\"\n\n\"How is one to change like that? And I do not know that he cares for\nme now.\"\n\n\"Ah;--I think he cares for you.\"\n\n\"Why should he? Is a man to be sacrificed for always because a girl\nwill not take him? His heart is changed. He takes care to show me so\nwhen he comes here. I am glad that it should be changed. Dear Patty,\nif papa would but come and live at home, I should want nothing else.\"\n\n\"I want something else,\" said Patience.\n\n\"I want nothing but that you should love me;--and that papa should be\nwith us. But, Patty, do not make me feel that you are afraid to speak\nto me.\"\n\nOn the day following Gregory was again at Fulham, and he had come\nthither fully determined that he would now for the last time ask that\nquestion, on the answer to which, as it now seemed to him, all his\nfuture happiness must depend. He had told himself that he would shake\noff this too human longing for a sweet face to be ever present with\nhim at his board, for a sweet heart to cherish him with its love, for\na dear head to lie upon his bosom. But he had owned to himself that\nit could not be shaken off, and having so owned, was more sick than\never with desire. Mary and Clarissa were both out when he arrived,\nand he was closeted for a while with Patience. \"How tired you must be\nof seeing me,\" he said.\n\n\"Tired of seeing you? Oh no!\"\n\n\"I feel myself to be going about like a phantom, and I am ashamed of\nmyself. My brother is successful and happy, and has all that he\ndesires.\"\n\n\"He is easily satisfied,\" said Patience, with something of sarcasm in\nher voice.\n\n\"And my cousin Ralph is happy and triumphant. I ought not to pine,\nbut in truth I am so weak that I am always pining. Tell me at\nonce,--is there a chance for me?\"\n\nDid it occur to him to think that she to whom he was speaking, ever\nasked herself why it was not given to her to have even a hope of that\njoy for which he was craving? Did she ever pine because, when others\nwere mating round her, flying off in pairs to their warm mutual\nnests, there came to her no such question of mating and flying off\nto love and happiness? If there was such pining, it was all inward,\nhidden from her friends so that their mirth should not be lessened by\nher want of mirth, not expressed either by her eye or mouth because\nshe knew that on the expression of her face depended somewhat of the\ncomfort of those who loved her. A homely brow, and plain features,\nand locks of hair that have not been combed by Love's attendant\nnymphs into soft and winning tresses, seems to tell us that Love is\nnot wanted by the bosom that owns them. We teach ourselves to regard\nsuch a one, let her be ever so good, with ever so sweet temper, ever\nso generous in heart, ever so affectionate among her friends, as\nseparated alike from the perils and the privileges of that passion\nwithout which they who are blessed or banned with beauty would regard\nlife but as a charred and mutilated existence. It is as though we\nshould believe that passion springs from the rind, which is fair\nor foul to the eye, and not in the heart, which is often fairest,\nfreshest, and most free, when the skin is dark and the cheeks are\nrough. This young parson expected Patience to sympathise with him, to\ngreet for him, to aid him if there might be aid, and to understand\nthat for him the world would be blank and wretched unless he could\nget for himself a soft sweet mate to sing when he sang, and to wail\nwhen he wailed. The only mate that Patience had was this very girl\nthat was to be thus taken from her. But she did sympathise with him,\ndid greet for him, did give him all her aid. Knowing what she was\nherself and how God had formed her, she had learned to bury self\nabsolutely and to take all her earthly joy from the joys of others.\nShall it not come to pass that, hereafter, she too shall have a lover\namong the cherubim? \"What can I say to you?\" replied Patience to the\nyoung man's earnest entreaty. \"If she were mine to give, I would give\nher to you instantly.\"\n\n\"Then you think there is no chance. If I thought that, why should I\ntrouble her again?\"\n\n\"I do not say so. Do you not know, Mr. Newton, that in such matters\neven sisters can hardly tell their thoughts to each other? How can\nthey when they do not even know their own wishes?\"\n\n\"She does not hate me then?\"\n\n\"Hate you! no;--she does not hate you. But there are so many degrees\nbetween hating and that kind of love which you want from her! You may\nbe sure of this, that she so esteems you that your persistence cannot\nlessen you in her regard.\"\n\nHe was still pleading his case with the elder sister,--very uselessly\nindeed, as he was aware; but having fallen on the subject of his love\nit was impossible for him to change it for any other,--when Clarissa\ncame into the room swinging her hat in her hand. She had been over\nat Miss Spooner's house and was full of Miss Spooner's woes and\ncomplaints. As soon as she had shaken hands with her lover and spoken\nthe few words of courtesy which the meeting demanded of her, she\nthrew herself into the affairs of Miss Spooner as though they were of\nvital interest. \"She is determined to be unhappy, Patty, and it is no\nuse trying to make her not so. She says that Jane robs her, which I\ndon't believe is true, and that Sarah has a lover,--and why shouldn't\nSarah have a lover? But as for curing her grievances, it would be\nthe cruellest thing in the world. She lives upon her grievances.\nSomething has happened to the chimney-pot, and the landlord hasn't\nsent a mason. She is revelling in her chimney-pot.\"\n\n\"Poor dear Miss Spooner,\" said Patience, getting up and leaving the\nroom as though it were her duty to look at once after her old friend\nin the midst of these troubles.\n\nClarissa had not intended this. \"She's asleep now,\" said Clarissa.\nBut Patience went all the same. It might be that Miss Spooner would\nrequire to be watched in her slumbers. When Patience was gone Gregory\nNewton got up from his seat and walked to the window. He stood\nthere for what seemed to be an endless number of seconds before he\nreturned, and Clarissa had time to determine that she would escape.\n\"I told Mary that I would go to her,\" she said, \"you won't mind being\nleft alone for a few minutes, Mr. Newton.\"\n\n\"Do not go just now, Clarissa.\"\n\n\"Only that I said I would,\" she answered, pleading that she must keep\na promise which she had never made.\n\n\"Mary can spare you,--and I cannot. Mary is staying with you, and I\nshall be gone,--almost immediately. I go back to Newton to-morrow,\nand who can say when I shall see you again?\"\n\n\"You will be coming up to London, of course.\"\n\n\"I am here now at any rate,\" he said smiling, \"and will take what\nadvantage of it I can. It is the old story, Clarissa;--so old that I\nknow you must be sick of it.\"\n\n\"If you think so, you should not tell it again.\"\n\n\"Do not be ill-natured to me. I don't know why it is but a man gets\nto be ashamed of himself, as though he were doing something mean\nand paltry, when he loves with persistence, as I do.\" Had it been\npossible that she should give him so much encouragement she would\nhave told him that the mean man, and paltry, was he who could love or\npretend to love with no capacity for persistency. She could not fail\nto draw a comparison between him and his brother, in which there was\nso much of meanness on the part of him who had at one time been as a\ngod to her, and so much nobility in him to whom she was and ever had\nbeen as a goddess. \"I suppose a man should take an answer and have\ndone with it,\" he continued. \"But how is a man to have done with it,\nwhen his heart remains the same?\"\n\n\"A man should master his heart.\"\n\n\"I am, then, to understand that that which you have said so often\nbefore must be said again?\" He had never knelt to her, and he did not\nkneel now; but he leaned over her so that she hardly knew whether\nhe was on his knees or still seated on his chair. And she herself,\nthough she answered him briskly,--almost with impertinence,--was so\nlittle mistress of herself that she knew not what she said. She would\ntake him now,--if only she knew how to take him without disgracing\nherself in her own estimation. \"Dear Clary, think of it. Try to love\nme. I need not tell you again how true is my love for you.\" He had\nhold of her hand, and she did not withdraw it, and he ought to have\nknown that the battle was won. But he knew nothing. He hardly knew\nthat her hand was in his. \"Clary, you are all the world to me. Must I\ngo back heart-laden, but empty-handed, with no comfort?\"\n\n\"If you knew all!\" she said, rising suddenly from her chair.\n\n\"All what?\"\n\n\"If you knew all, you would not take me though I offered myself.\"\nHe stood staring at her, not at all comprehending her words, and\nshe perceived in the midst of her distress that it was needful that\nshe should explain herself. \"I have loved Ralph always;--yes, your\nbrother.\"\n\n\"And he?\"\n\n\"I will not accuse him in anything. He is married now, and it is\npast.\"\n\n\"And you can never love again?\"\n\n\"Who would take such a heart as that? It would not be worth the\ngiving or worth the taking. Oh--how I loved him!\" Then he left her\nside, and went back to the window, while she sank back upon her\nchair, and, burying her face in her hands, gave way to tears and\nsobs. He stood there perhaps for a minute, and then returning to her,\nso gently that she did not hear him, he did kneel at her side. He\nknelt, and putting his hand upon her arm, he kissed the sleeve of her\ngown. \"You had better go from me now,\" she said, amidst her sobs.\n\n\"I will never go from you again,\" he answered. \"God's mercy can cure\nalso that wound, and I will be his minister in healing it. Clarissa,\nI am so glad that you have told me all. Looking back I can understand\nit now. I once thought that it was so.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"yes; it was so.\"\n\nGradually one hand of hers fell into his, and though no word of\nacceptance had been spoken he knew that he was at last accepted. \"My\nown Clary,\" he said. \"I may call you my own?\" There was no answer,\nbut he knew that it was so. \"Nothing shall be done to trouble\nyou;--nothing shall be said to press you. You may be sure of this, if\nit be good to be loved,--that no woman was ever loved more tenderly\nthan you are.\"\n\n\"I do know it,\" she said, through her tears.\n\nThen he rose and stood again at the window, looking out upon the lawn\nand the river. She was still weeping, but he hardly heeded her tears.\nIt was better for her that she should weep than restrain them. And,\nas to himself and his own feelings,--he tried to question himself,\nwhether, in truth, was he less happy in this great possession, which\nhe had at last gained, because his brother had for a while interfered\nwith him in gaining it? That she would be as true to him now, as\ntender and as loving, as though Ralph had never crossed her path,\nhe did not for a moment doubt. That she would be less sweet to him\nbecause her sweetness had been offered to another he would not admit\nto himself,--even though the question were asked. She would be all\nhis own, and was she not the one thing in the world which he coveted?\nHe did think that for such a one as his Clarissa he would be a better\nmate than would have been his brother, and he was sure that she\nherself would learn to know that it was so. He stood there long\nenough to resolve that this which had been told him should be no\ndrawback upon his bliss. \"Clary,\" he said, returning to her, \"it is\nsettled?\" She made him no answer. \"My darling, I am as happy now\nas though Ralph had never seen your sweet face, or heard your dear\nvoice. Look up at me once.\" Slowly she looked up into his eyes, and\nthen stood before him almost as a suppliant, and gave him her face to\nbe kissed. So at last they became engaged as man and wife;--though\nit may be doubted whether she spoke another word before he left the\nroom.\n\nIt was, however, quite understood that they were engaged; and, though\nhe did not see Clarissa again, he received the congratulations both\nof Patience and Mary Bonner before he left the house; and that very\nnight succeeded in hunting down Sir Thomas, so that he might tell the\nfather that the daughter had at last consented to become his wife.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVIII.\n\nCONCLUSION.\n\n\nClarissa had found it hard to change the object of her love, so hard,\nthat for a time she had been unwilling even to make the effort;--and\nshe had been ashamed that those around her should think that she\nwould make it; but when the thing was done, her second hero was\ndearer to her than ever had been the first. He at least was true.\nWith him there was no need of doubt. His assurances were not conveyed\nin words so light that they might mean much or little. This second\nlover was a lover, indeed, who thought no pains too great to show her\nthat she was ever growing in his heart of hearts. For a while,--for\na week or two,--she restrained her tongue; but when once she had\naccustomed herself to the coaxing kindness of her sister and her\ncousin, then her eloquence was loosened, and Gregory Newton was a\ngod indeed. In the course of time she got a very pretty note from\nRalph, congratulating her, as he also had congratulated Polly, and\nexpressing a fear that he might not be home in time to be present\nat the wedding. Augusta was so fond of Rome that they did not mean\nto leave it till the late spring. Then, after a while, there came\nto her, also, a watch and chain, twice as costly as those given to\nPolly,--which, however, no persuasion from Gregory would ever induce\nClarissa to wear. In after time Ralph never noticed that the trinkets\nwere not worn.\n\nThe winter at Popham Villa went on very much as other winters had\ngone, except that two of the girls living there were full of future\nhopes, and preparing for future cares, while the third occupied her\nheart and mind with the cares and hopes of the other two. Patience,\nhowever, had one other task in hand, a task upon the performance of\nwhich her future happiness much depended, and in respect to which she\nnow ventured to hope for success. Wherever her future home might be,\nit would be terrible to her if her father would not consent to occupy\nit with her. It had been settled that both the marriages should take\nplace early in April,--both on the same day, and, as a matter of\ncourse, the weddings would be celebrated at Fulham. Christmas had\ncome and gone, and winter was going, before Sir Thomas had absolutely\npromised to renew that order for the making of the packing-cases for\nhis books. \"You won't go back, papa, after they are married,\"\nPatience said to her father, early in March.\n\n\"If I do it shall not be for long.\"\n\n\"Not for a day, papa! Surely you will not leave me alone? There will\nbe plenty of room now. The air of Fulham will be better for your work\nthan those stuffy, dark, dingy lawyers' chambers.\"\n\n\"My dear, all the work of my life that was worth doing was done in\nthose stuffy, dingy rooms.\" That was all that Sir Thomas said, but\nthe accusation conveyed to him by his daughter's words was very\nheavy. For years past he had sat intending to work, purposing to\nachieve a great task which he set for himself, and had done--almost\nnothing. Might it be yet possible that that purer air of which\nPatty spoke should produce new energy, and lead to better results?\nThe promise of it did at least produce new resolutions. It was\nimpossible, as Patience had said, that his child should be left to\ndwell alone, while yet she had a father living.\n\n\"Stemm,\" he said, \"I told you to get some packing-cases made.\"\n\n\"Packing-cases, Sir Thomas?\"\n\n\"Yes;--packing-cases for the books. It was months ago. Are they\nready?\"\n\n\"No, Sir Thomas. They ain't ready.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Well, Sir Thomas;--they ain't; that's all.\" Then the order was\nrepeated in a manner so formal, as to make Stemm understand that it\nwas intended for a fact. \"You are going away from this; are you, Sir\nThomas?\"\n\n\"I believe that I shall give the chambers up altogether at midsummer.\nAt any rate, I mean to have the books packed at once.\"\n\n\"Very well, Sir Thomas.\" Then there was a pause, during which Stemm\ndid not leave the room. Nor did Sir Thomas dismiss him, feeling that\nthere might well be other things which would require discussion. \"And\nabout me, Sir Thomas?\" said Stemm.\n\n\"I have been thinking about that, Stemm.\"\n\n\"So have I, Sir Thomas,--more nor once.\"\n\n\"You can come to Fulham if you like,--only you must not scold the\nmaids.\"\n\n\"Very well, Sir Thomas,\" said Stemm, with hardly any variation in his\nvoice, but still with less of care upon his brow.\n\n\"Mind, I will not have you scolding them at the villa.\"\n\n\"Not unless they deserve it, Sir Thomas,\" said Stemm. Sir Thomas\ncould say nothing further. For our own part we fear that the maidens\nat the villa will not be the better in conduct, as they certainly\nwill not be more comfortable in their lives, in consequence of this\nchange.\n\nAnd the books were moved in large packing-cases, not one of which had\nyet been opened when the two brides returned to Popham Villa after\ntheir wedding tours, to see Patience just for a day before they were\ntaken to their new homes. Nevertheless, let us hope that the change\nof air and of scene may tend to future diligence, and that the magnus\nopus may yet be achieved. We have heard of editions of Aristophanes,\nof Polybius, of the Iliad, of Ovid, and what not, which have ever\nbeen forthcoming under the hands of notable scholars, who have grown\ngrey amidst the renewed promises which have been given. And some of\nthese works have come forth, belying the prophecies of incredulous\nfriends. Let us hope that the great Life of Bacon may yet be written.\n\n\n\n\n\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber's note:\n\n   Trollope was sometimes inconsistent with names of people or places.\n   In the early pages of this novel the name of Mr. Neefit's home was\n   Alexandrina Cottage. In the middle of the book it became Alexandria\n   Cottage, and in later pages it was Alexandra Cottage. The names have\n   been transcribed as they were in the original.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK RALPH THE HEIR***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 25579-8.txt or 25579-8.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/2\/5\/5\/7\/25579\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":476,"split":"train"}
