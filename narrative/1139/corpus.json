William Porphyry Benham is a man who has lived a life devoted to a complicated, protean idea: \"that he had to live life nobly and thoroughly.\" He has left behind him \"half a score of patent files quite distended [with papers] and a writing-table drawer-full,\" and the novel is by implication what his friend White, who has promised to \"see after your book,\" has produced to acquit himself of the promise, since the papers themselves are \"an indigestible aggregation.\"\nBenham is a man of means due to curious circumstances: his mother left his father, a schoolmaster, for a wealthy man named Nolan who died soon thereafter, but not before leaving \"about a third of his very large fortune entirely to Mrs. Benham and the rest to her in trust for her son, whom he deemed himself to have injured.\" His mother subsequently marries a great London surgeon and becomes Lady Marayne; her indiscretion is forgiven and she enjoys a position of privilege.\nThe bulk of the novel recounts Benham's effort to live nobly, which brings him into conflict with his mother, with his friend Prothero, a schoolboy chum who becomes a Cambridge don, and with his wife, Amanda, a young woman he loves passionately but then leaves behind in England to travel the world (India, Russia, China) in search of wisdom.

It was an idea that took possession of his\nimagination quite early in life, it grew with him and changed with him,\nit interwove at last completely with his being. His story is its story.\nIt was traceably germinating in the schoolboy; it was manifestly present\nin his mind at the very last moment of his adventurous life. He belonged\nto that fortunate minority who are independent of daily necessities, so\nthat he was free to go about the world under its direction. It led him\nfar. It led him into situations that bordered upon the fantastic, it\nmade him ridiculous, it came near to making him sublime. And this idea\nof his was of such a nature that in several aspects he could document\nit. Its logic forced him to introspection and to the making of a record.\n\nAn idea that can play so large a part in a life must necessarily have\nsomething of the complication and protean quality of life itself. It is\nnot to be stated justly in any formula, it is not to be rendered by an\nepigram. As well one might show a man's skeleton for his portrait. Yet,\nessentially, Benham's idea was simple. He had an incurable, an almost\ninnate persuasion that he had to live life nobly and thoroughly. His\ncommoner expression for that thorough living is \"the aristocratic life.\"\nBut by \"aristocratic\" he meant something very different from the\nquality of a Russian prince, let us say, or an English peer. He meant an\nintensity, a clearness.... Nobility for him was to get something out of\nhis individual existence, a flame, a jewel, a splendour--it is a thing\neasier to understand than to say.\n\nOne might hesitate to call this idea \"innate,\" and yet it comes soon\ninto a life when it comes at all. In Benham's case we might trace it\nback to the Day Nursery at Seagate, we might detect it stirring already\nat the petticoat stage, in various private struttings and valiant\ndreamings with a helmet of pasteboard and a white-metal sword. We have\nmost of us been at least as far as that with Benham. And we have\ndied like Horatius, slaying our thousands for our country, or we have\nperished at the stake or faced the levelled muskets of the firing\nparty--\"No, do not bandage my eyes\"--because we would not betray the\nsecret path that meant destruction to our city. But with Benham the\nvein was stronger, and it increased instead of fading out as he grew\nto manhood. It was less obscured by those earthy acquiescences, those\ndiscretions, that saving sense of proportion, which have made most of\nus so satisfactorily what we are. \"Porphyry,\" his mother had discovered\nbefore he was seventeen, \"is an excellent boy, a brilliant boy, but, I\nbegin to see, just a little unbalanced.\"\n\nThe interest of him, the absurdity of him, the story of him, is that.\n\nMost of us are--balanced; in spite of occasional reveries we do come to\nterms with the limitations of life, with those desires and dreams and\ndiscretions that, to say the least of it, qualify our nobility, we take\nrefuge in our sense of humour and congratulate ourselves on a certain\namiable freedom from priggishness or presumption, but for Benham that\neasy declension to a humorous acceptance of life as it is did not occur.\nHe found his limitations soon enough; he was perpetually\nrediscovering them, but out of these interments of the spirit he rose\nagain--remarkably. When we others have decided that, to be plain about\nit, we are not going to lead the noble life at all, that the thing is\ntoo ambitious and expensive even to attempt, we have done so because\nthere were other conceptions of existence that were good enough for us,\nwe decided that instead of that glorious impossible being of ourselves,\nwe would figure in our own eyes as jolly fellows, or sly dogs, or sane,\nsound, capable men or brilliant successes, and so forth--practicable\nthings. For Benham, exceptionally, there were not these practicable\nthings. He blundered, he fell short of himself, he had--as you will\nbe told--some astonishing rebuffs, but they never turned him aside for\nlong. He went by nature for this preposterous idea of nobility as a\nlinnet hatched in a cage will try to fly.\n\nAnd when he discovered--and in this he was assisted not a little by his\nfriend at his elbow--when he discovered that Nobility was not the simple\nthing he had at first supposed it to be, he set himself in a mood only\nslightly disconcerted to the discovery of Nobility. When it dawned upon\nhim, as it did, that one cannot be noble, so to speak, IN VACUO, he set\nhimself to discover a Noble Society. He began with simple beliefs and\nfine attitudes and ended in a conscious research. If he could not get\nthrough by a stride, then it followed that he must get through by a\nclimb. He spent the greater part of his life studying and experimenting\nin the noble possibilities of man. He never lost his absurd faith in\nthat conceivable splendour. At first it was always just round the corner\nor just through the wood; to the last it seemed still but a little way\nbeyond the distant mountains.\n\nFor this reason this story has been called THE RESEARCH MAGNIFICENT. It\nwas a real research, it was documented. In the rooms in Westhaven Street\nthat at last were as much as one could call his home, he had accumulated\nmaterial for--one hesitates to call it a book--let us say it was an\nanalysis of, a guide to the noble life. There after his tragic death\ncame his old friend White, the journalist and novelist, under a promise,\nand found these papers; he found them to the extent of a crammed\nbureau, half a score of patent files quite distended and a writing-table\ndrawer-full, and he was greatly exercised to find them. They were,\nWhite declares, they are still after much experienced handling, an\nindigestible aggregation. On this point White is very assured. When\nBenham thought he was gathering together a book he was dreaming, White\nsays. There is no book in it....\n\nPerhaps too, one might hazard, Benham was dreaming when he thought the\nnoble life a human possibility. Perhaps man, like the ape and the hyaena\nand the tapeworm and many other of God's necessary but less attractive\ncreatures, is not for such exalted ends. That doubt never seems to have\ngot a lodgment in Benham's skull; though at times one might suppose it\nthe basis of White's thought. You will find in all Benham's story,\nif only it can be properly told, now subdued, now loud and amazed and\ndistressed, but always traceable, this startled, protesting question,\n\"BUT WHY THE DEVIL AREN'T WE?\" As though necessarily we ought to be.\nHe never faltered in his persuasion that behind the dingy face of this\nworld, the earthy stubbornness, the baseness and dulness of himself\nand all of us, lurked the living jewels of heaven, the light of glory,\nthings unspeakable. At first it seemed to him that one had only just to\nhammer and will, and at the end, after a life of willing and hammering,\nhe was still convinced there was something, something in the nature of\nan Open Sesame, perhaps a little more intricate than one had supposed\nat first, a little more difficult to secure, but still in that nature,\nwhich would suddenly roll open for mankind the magic cave of the\nuniverse, that precious cave at the heart of all things, in which one\nmust believe.\n\nAnd then life--life would be the wonder it so perplexingly just\nisn't....\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nBenham did not go about the world telling people of this consuming\nresearch. He was not the prophet or preacher of his idea. It was too\nliving and intricate and uncertain a part of him to speak freely about.\nIt was his secret self; to expose it casually would have shamed him. He\ndrew all sorts of reserves about him, he wore his manifest imperfections\nturned up about him like an overcoat in bitter wind. He was content\nto be inexplicable. His thoughts led him to the conviction that this\nmagnificent research could not be, any more than any other research\ncan be, a solitary enterprise, but he delayed expression; in a mighty\nwriting and stowing away of these papers he found a relief from the\nunpleasant urgency to confess and explain himself prematurely. So that\nWhite, though he knew Benham with the intimacy of an old schoolfellow\nwho had renewed his friendship, and had shared his last days and been a\nwitness of his death, read the sheets of manuscript often with surprise\nand with a sense of added elucidation.\n\nAnd, being also a trained maker of books, White as he read was more\nand more distressed that an accumulation so interesting should be so\nentirely unshaped for publication. \"But this will never make a book,\"\nsaid White with a note of personal grievance. His hasty promise in their\nlast moments together had bound him, it seemed, to a task he now found\nimpossible. He would have to work upon it tremendously; and even then he\ndid not see how it could be done.\n\nThis collection of papers was not a story, not an essay, not a\nconfession, not a diary. It was--nothing definable. It went into no\nconceivable covers. It was just, White decided, a proliferation. A vast\nproliferation. It wanted even a title. There were signs that Benham had\nintended to call it THE ARISTOCRATIC LIFE, and that he had tried at some\nother time the title of AN ESSAY ON ARISTOCRACY. Moreover, it would\nseem that towards the end he had been disposed to drop the word\n\"aristocratic\" altogether, and adopt some such phrase as THE LARGER\nLIFE. Once it was LIFE SET FREE. He had fallen away more and more from\nnearly everything that one associates with aristocracy--at the end only\nits ideals of fearlessness and generosity remained.\n\nOf all these titles THE ARISTOCRATIC LIFE seemed at first most like\na clue to White. Benham's erratic movements, his sudden impulses, his\nangers, his unaccountable patiences, his journeys to strange places, and\nhis lapses into what had seemed to be pure adventurousness, could all be\nput into system with that. Before White had turned over three pages of\nthe great fascicle of manuscript that was called Book Two, he had found\nthe word \"Bushido\" written with a particularly flourishing capital\nletter and twice repeated. \"That was inevitable,\" said White with the\ncomforting regret one feels for a friend's banalities. \"And it dates...\n[unreadable] this was early....\"\n\n\"Modern aristocracy, the new aristocracy,\" he read presently, \"has still\nto be discovered and understood. This is the necessary next step for\nmankind. As far as possible I will discover and understand it, and as\nfar as I know it I will be it. This is the essential disposition of my\nmind. God knows I have appetites and sloths and habits and blindnesses,\nbut so far as it is in my power to release myself I will escape to\nthis....\"\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nWhite sat far into the night and for several nights turning over papers\nand rummaging in untidy drawers. Memories came back to him of his dead\nfriend and pieced themselves together with other memories and joined\non to scraps in this writing. Bold yet convincing guesses began to leap\nacross the gaps. A story shaped itself....\n\nThe story began with the schoolfellow he had known at Minchinghampton\nSchool.\n\nBenham had come up from his father's preparatory school at Seagate. He\nhad been a boy reserved rather than florid in his acts and manners, a\nboy with a pale face, incorrigible hair and brown eyes that went dark\nand deep with excitement. Several times White had seen him excited, and\nwhen he was excited Benham was capable of tensely daring things. On one\noccasion he had insisted upon walking across a field in which was an\naggressive bull. It had been put there to prevent the boys taking\na short cut to the swimming place. It had bellowed tremendously and\nfinally charged him. He had dodged it and got away; at the time it had\nseemed an immense feat to White and the others who were safely up\nthe field. He had walked to the fence, risking a second charge by his\ndeliberation. Then he had sat on the fence and declared his intention\nof always crossing the field so long as the bull remained there. He had\nsaid this with white intensity, he had stopped abruptly in mid-sentence,\nand then suddenly he had dropped to the ground, clutched the fence,\nstruggled with heaving shoulders, and been sick.\n\nThe combination of apparently stout heart and manifestly weak stomach\nhad exercised the Minchinghampton intelligence profoundly.\n\nOn one or two other occasions Benham had shown courage of the same\nrather screwed-up sort. He showed it not only in physical but in mental\nthings. A boy named Prothero set a fashion of religious discussion\nin the school, and Benham, after some self-examination, professed an\natheistical republicanism rather in the manner of Shelley. This brought\nhim into open conflict with Roddles, the History Master. Roddles had\ndiscovered these theological controversies in some mysterious way, and\nhe took upon himself to talk at Benham and Prothero. He treated them to\nthe common misapplication of that fool who \"hath said in his heart there\nis no God.\" He did not perceive there was any difference between the\nfool who says a thing in his heart and one who says it in the dormitory.\nHe revived that delectable anecdote of the Eton boy who professed\ndisbelief and was at once \"soundly flogged\" by his head master. \"Years\nafterwards that boy came back to thank ----\"\n\n\"Gurr,\" said Prothero softly. \"STEW--ard!\"\n\n\"Your turn next, Benham,\" whispered an orthodox controversialist.\n\n\"Good Lord! I'd like to see him,\" said Benham with a forced loudness\nthat could scarcely be ignored.\n\nThe subsequent controversy led to an interview with the head. From\nit Benham emerged more whitely strung up than ever. \"He said he would\ncertainly swish me if I deserved it, and I said I would certainly kill\nhim if he did.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"He told me to go away and think it over. Said he would preach about\nit next Sunday.... Well, a swishing isn't a likely thing anyhow. But\nI would.... There isn't a master here I'd stand a thrashing from--not\none.... And because I choose to say what I think!... I'd run amuck.\"\n\nFor a week or so the school was exhilarated by a vain and ill-concealed\nhope that the head might try it just to see if Benham would. It was\ntantalizingly within the bounds of possibility....\n\nThese incidents came back to White's mind as he turned over the\nnewspapers in the upper drawer of the bureau. The drawer was labelled\n\"Fear--the First Limitation,\" and the material in it was evidently\ndesigned for the opening volume of the great unfinished book. Indeed, a\nportion of it was already arranged and written up.\n\nAs White read through this manuscript he was reminded of a score of\nschoolboy discussions Benham and he and Prothero had had together. Here\nwas the same old toughness of mind, a kind of intellectual hardihood,\nthat had sometimes shocked his schoolfellows. Benham had been one of\nthose boys who do not originate ideas very freely, but who go out to\nthem with a fierce sincerity. He believed and disbelieved with emphasis.\nProthero had first set him doubting, but it was Benham's own temperament\ntook him on to denial. His youthful atheism had been a matter for secret\nconsternation in White. White did not believe very much in God even\nthen, but this positive disbelieving frightened him. It was going\ntoo far. There had been a terrible moment in the dormitory, during a\nthunderstorm, a thunderstorm so vehement that it had awakened them\nall, when Latham, the humourist and a quietly devout boy, had suddenly\nchallenged Benham to deny his Maker.\n\n\"NOW say you don't believe in God?\"\n\nBenham sat up in bed and repeated his negative faith, while little\nHopkins, the Bishop's son, being less certain about the accuracy of\nProvidence than His aim, edged as far as he could away from Benham's\ncubicle and rolled his head in his bedclothes.\n\n\"And anyhow,\" said Benham, when it was clear that he was not to be\nstruck dead forthwith, \"you show a poor idea of your God to think he'd\nkill a schoolboy for honest doubt. Even old Roddles--\"\n\n\"I can't listen to you,\" cried Latham the humourist, \"I can't listen to\nyou. It's--HORRIBLE.\"\n\n\"Well, who began it?\" asked Benham.\n\nA flash of lightning lit the dormitory and showed him to White\nwhite-faced and ablaze with excitement, sitting up with the bed-clothes\nabout him. \"Oh WOW!\" wailed the muffled voice of little Hopkins as the\nthunder burst like a giant pistol overhead, and he buried his head still\ndeeper in the bedclothes and gave way to unappeasable grief.\n\nLatham's voice came out of the darkness. \"This ATHEISM that you and\nBilly Prothero have brought into the school--\"\n\nHe started violently at another vivid flash, and every one remained\nsilent, waiting for the thunder....\n\nBut White remembered no more of the controversy because he had made a\nfrightful discovery that filled and blocked his mind. Every time the\nlightning flashed, there was a red light in Benham's eyes....\n\nIt was only three days after when Prothero discovered exactly the same\nphenomenon in the School House boothole and talked of cats and cattle,\nthat White's confidence in their friend was partially restored....\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\"Fear, the First Limitation\"--his title indicated the spirit of Benham's\nopening book very clearly. His struggle with fear was the very beginning\nof his soul's history. It continued to the end. He had hardly decided to\nlead the noble life before he came bump against the fact that he was\na physical coward. He felt fear acutely. \"Fear,\" he wrote, \"is the\nforemost and most persistent of the shepherding powers that keep us\nin the safe fold, that drive us back to the beaten track and comfort\nand--futility. The beginning of all aristocracy is the subjugation of\nfear.\"\n\nAt first the struggle was so great that he hated fear without any\nqualification; he wanted to abolish it altogether.\n\n\"When I was a boy,\" he writes, \"I thought I would conquer fear for good\nand all, and never more be troubled by it. But it is not to be done in\nthat way. One might as well dream of having dinner for the rest of one's\nlife. Each time and always I have found that it has to be conquered\nafresh. To this day I fear, little things as well as big things. I have\nto grapple with some little dread every day--urge myself.... Just as\nI have to wash and shave myself every day.... I believe it is so with\nevery one, but it is difficult to be sure; few men who go into dangers\ncare very much to talk about fear....\"\n\nLater Benham found some excuses for fear, came even to dealings with\nfear. He never, however, admits that this universal instinct is any\nbetter than a kindly but unintelligent nurse from whose fostering\nrestraints it is man's duty to escape. Discretion, he declared, must\nremain; a sense of proportion, an \"adequacy of enterprise,\" but the\ndiscretion of an aristocrat is in his head, a tactical detail, it has\nnothing to do with this visceral sinking, this ebb in the nerves. \"From\ntop to bottom, the whole spectrum of fear is bad, from panic fear at\none extremity down to that mere disinclination for enterprise, that\nreluctance and indolence which is its lowest phase. These are things of\nthe beast, these are for creatures that have a settled environment, a\nlife history, that spin in a cage of instincts. But man is a beast of\nthat kind no longer, he has left his habitat, he goes out to limitless\nliving....\"\n\nThis idea of man going out into new things, leaving securities, habits,\ncustoms, leaving his normal life altogether behind him, underlay all\nBenham's aristocratic conceptions. And it was natural that he\nshould consider fear as entirely inconvenient, treat it indeed with\ningratitude, and dwell upon the immense liberations that lie beyond for\nthose who will force themselves through its remonstrances....\n\nBenham confessed his liability to fear quite freely in these notes. His\nfear of animals was ineradicable. He had had an overwhelming dread of\nbears until he was twelve or thirteen, the child's irrational dread\nof impossible bears, bears lurking under the bed and in the evening\nshadows. He confesses that even up to manhood he could not cross a\nfield containing cattle without keeping a wary eye upon them--his bull\nadventure rather increased than diminished that disposition--he hated a\nstrange dog at his heels and would manoeuvre himself as soon as possible\nout of reach of the teeth or heels of a horse. But the peculiar dread of\nhis childhood was tigers. Some gaping nursemaid confronted him suddenly\nwith a tiger in a cage in the menagerie annexe of a circus. \"My small\nmind was overwhelmed.\"\n\n\"I had never thought,\" White read, \"that a tiger was much larger than\na St. Bernard dog.... This great creature!... I could not believe any\nhunter would attack such a monster except by stealth and with weapons of\nenormous power....\n\n\"He jerked himself to and fro across his cramped, rickety cage and\nlooked over my head with yellow eyes--at some phantom far away. Every\nnow and then he snarled. The contempt of his detestable indifference\nsank deeper and deeper into my soul. I knew that were the cage to vanish\nI should stand there motionless, his helpless prey. I knew that were he\nat large in the same building with me I should be too terror-stricken\nto escape him. At the foot of a ladder leading clear to escape I should\nhave awaited him paralyzed. At last I gripped my nurse's hand. 'Take me\naway,' I whispered.\n\n\"In my dreams that night he stalked me. I made my frozen flight from\nhim, I slammed a door on him, and he thrust his paw through a panel\nas though it had been paper and clawed for me. The paw got longer and\nlonger....\n\n\"I screamed so loudly that my father came up from his study.\n\n\"I remember that he took me in his arms.\n\n\"'It's only a big sort of pussy, Poff,' he said. 'FELIS TIGRIS. FELIS,\nyou know, means cat.'\n\n\"But I knew better. I was in no mood then for my father's insatiable\npedagoguery.\n\n\"'And my little son mustn't be a coward.'...\n\n\"After that I understood I must keep silence and bear my tigers alone.\n\n\"For years the thought of that tiger's immensity haunted my mind. In\nmy dreams I cowered before it a thousand times; in the dusk it rarely\nfailed me. On the landing on my way to bed there was a patch of darkness\nbeyond a chest that became a lurking horror for me, and sometimes the\ndoor of my father's bedroom would stand open and there was a long buff\nand crimson-striped shape, by day indeed an ottoman, but by night--.\nCould an ottoman crouch and stir in the flicker of a passing candle?\nCould an ottoman come after you noiselessly, and so close that you could\nnot even turn round upon it? No!\"\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nWhen Benham was already seventeen and, as he supposed, hardened against\nhis fear of beasts, his friend Prothero gave him an account of the\nkilling of an old labouring man by a stallion which had escaped out of\nits stable. The beast had careered across a field, leapt a hedge and\ncome upon its victim suddenly. He had run a few paces and stopped,\ntrying to defend his head with the horse rearing over him. It beat him\ndown with two swift blows of its fore hoofs, one, two, lifted him up in\nits long yellow teeth and worried him as a terrier does a rat--the poor\nold wretch was still able to make a bleating sound at that--dropped him,\ntrampled and kicked him as he tried to crawl away, and went on trampling\nand battering him until he was no more than a bloody inhuman bundle of\nclothes and mire. For more than half an hour this continued, and then\nits animal rage was exhausted and it desisted, and went and grazed at\na little distance from this misshapen, hoof-marked, torn, and muddy\nremnant of a man. No one it seems but a horror-stricken child knew what\nwas happening....\n\nThis picture of human indignity tortured Benham's imagination much more\nthan it tortured the teller of the tale. It filled him with shame and\nhorror. For three or four years every detail of that circumstantial\nnarrative seemed unforgettable. A little lapse from perfect health and\nthe obsession returned. He could not endure the neighing of horses: when\nhe saw horses galloping in a field with him his heart stood still. And\nall his life thereafter he hated horses.\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nA different sort of fear that also greatly afflicted Benham was due to a\ncertain clumsiness and insecurity he felt in giddy and unstable places.\nThere he was more definitely balanced between the hopelessly rash and\nthe pitifully discreet.\n\nHe had written an account of a private struggle between himself and a\ncertain path of planks and rock edges called the Bisse of Leysin. This\nhappened in his adolescence. He had had a bad attack of influenza and\nhis doctor had sent him to a little hotel--the only hotel it was in\nthose days--at Montana in Valais. There, later, when he had picked up\nhis strength, his father was to join him and take him mountaineering,\nthat second-rate mountaineering which is so dear to dons and\nschoolmasters. When the time came he was ready for that, but he had had\nhis experiences. He had gone through a phase of real cowardice. He was\nafraid, he confessed, before even he reached Montana; he was afraid of\nthe steepness of the mountains. He had to drive ten or twelve miles\nup and up the mountain-side, a road of innumerable hairpin bends and\nprecipitous banks, the horse was gaunt and ugly with a disposition to\nshy, and he confesses he clutched the side of the vehicle and speculated\nhow he should jump if presently the whole turnout went tumbling over....\n\n\"And afterwards I dreamt dreams of precipices. I made strides over\nprecipices, I fell and fell with a floating swiftness towards remote\nvalleys, I was assailed by eagles upon a perilous ledge that crumbled\naway and left me clinging by my nails to nothing.\"\n\nThe Bisse of Leysin is one of those artificial water-courses which bring\nwater from some distant source to pastures that have an insufficient\nor uncertain supply. It is a little better known than most because of\na certain exceptional boldness in its construction; for a distance of a\nfew score yards it runs supported by iron staples across the front of\na sheer precipice, and for perhaps half a mile it hangs like an eyebrow\nover nearly or quite vertical walls of pine-set rock. Beside it, on\nthe outer side of it, runs a path, which becomes an offhand gangway\nof planking at the overhanging places. At one corner, which gives the\nfavourite picture postcard from Montana, the rocks project so sharply\nabove the water that the passenger on the gangway must crouch down upon\nthe bending plank as he walks. There is no hand-hold at all.\n\nA path from Montana takes one over a pine-clad spur and down a\nprecipitous zig-zag upon the middle of the Bisse, and thither Benham\ncame, fascinated by the very fact that here was something of which the\nmere report frightened him. He had to walk across the cold clear rush\nof the Bisse upon a pine log, and then he found himself upon one of the\ngentler interludes of the Bisse track. It was a scrambling path nearly\ntwo feet wide, and below it were slopes, but not so steep as to terrify.\nAt a vast distance below he saw through tree-stems and blue haze a\ntwisted strand of bright whiteness, the river that joins the Rhone at\nSion. It looped about and passed out of sight remotely beneath his feet.\nHe turned to the right, and came to a corner that overhung a precipice.\nHe craned his head round this corner and saw the evil place of the\npicture-postcards.\n\nHe remained for a long time trying to screw himself up to walk along the\njagged six-inch edge of rock between cliff and torrent into which the\npath has shrunken, to the sagging plank under the overhanging rock\nbeyond.\n\nHe could not bring himself to do that.\n\n\"It happened that close to the corner a large lump of rock and earth\nwas breaking away, a cleft was opening, so that presently, it seemed\npossible at any moment, the mass would fall headlong into the blue deeps\nbelow. This impending avalanche was not in my path along the Bisse, it\nwas no sort of danger to me, but in some way its insecurity gave a final\ntouch to my cowardice. I could not get myself round that corner.\"\n\nHe turned away. He went and examined the planks in the other direction,\nand these he found less forbidding. He crossed one precipitous place,\nwith a fall of twoscore feet or less beneath him, and found worse ahead.\nThere also he managed. A third place was still more disagreeable.\nThe plank was worn and thin, and sagged under him. He went along it\nsupporting himself against the rock above the Bisse with an extended\nhand. Halfway the rock fell back, so that there was nothing whatever\nto hold. He stopped, hesitating whether he should go back--but on\nthis plank there was no going back because no turning round seemed\npracticable. While he was still hesitating there came a helpful\nintervention. Behind him he saw a peasant appearing and disappearing\nbehind trees and projecting rock masses, and coming across the previous\nplank at a vigorous trot....\n\nUnder the stimulus of a spectator Benham got to the end of this third\nplace without much trouble. Then very politely he stood aside for the\nexpert to go ahead so that he could follow at his own pace.\n\nThere were, however, more difficulties yet to come, and a disagreeable\nhumiliation. That confounded peasant developed a parental solicitude.\nAfter each crossing he waited, and presently began to offer advice and\nencouragement. At last came a place where everything was overhanging,\nwhere the Bisse was leaking, and the plank wet and slippery. The water\nran out of the leak near the brim of the wooden channel and fell in a\nlong shivering thread of silver. THERE WAS NO SOUND OF ITS FALL. It just\nfell--into a void. Benham wished he had not noted that. He groaned, but\nfaced the plank; he knew this would be the slowest affair of all.\n\nThe peasant surveyed him from the further side.\n\n\"Don't be afraid!\" cried the peasant in his clumsy Valaisian French,\nand returned, returning along the plank that seemed quite sufficiently\nloaded without him, extending a charitable hand.\n\n\"Damn!\" whispered Benham, but he took the hand.\n\nAfterwards, rather ignobly, he tried to explain in his public-school\nFrench. \"Pas de peur,\" he said. \"Pas de peur. Mais la tete, n'a pas\nl'habitude.\"\n\nThe peasant, failing to understand, assured him again that there was no\ndanger.\n\n(\"Damn!\")\n\nBenham was led over all the other planks, he was led as if he was an\nold lady crossing a glacier. He was led into absolute safety, and\nshamefacedly he rewarded his guide. Then he went a little way and sat\ndown, swore softly, and watched the honest man go striding and plunging\ndown towards Lens until he was out of sight.\n\n\"Now,\" said Benham to himself, \"if I do not go back along the planks my\nsecret honour is gone for ever.\"\n\nHe told himself that he had not a good head, that he was not well, that\nthe sun was setting and the light no longer good, that he had a very\ngood chance indeed of getting killed. Then it came to him suddenly as a\nclear and simple truth, as something luminously plain, that it is better\nto get killed than go away defeated by such fears and unsteadiness as\nhis. The change came into his mind as if a white light were suddenly\nturned on--where there had been nothing but shadows and darkness. He\nrose to his feet and went swiftly and intently the whole way back, going\nwith a kind of temperate recklessness, and, because he was no longer\ncareful, easily. He went on beyond his starting place toward the corner,\nand did that supreme bit, to and fro, that bit where the lump was\nfalling away, and he had to crouch, as gaily as the rest. Then he\nrecrossed the Bisse upon the pine log, clambered up through the pines to\nthe crest, and returned through the meadows to his own hotel.\n\nAfter that he should have slept the sleep of contentment, but instead\nhe had quite dreadful nightmares, of hanging in frozen fear above\nincredible declivities, of ill-aimed leaps across chasms to slippery\nfootholds, of planks that swayed and broke suddenly in the middle and\nheaded him down and down....\n\nThe next day in the sunshine he walked the Bisse again with those dreams\nlike trailing mists in his mind, and by comparison the path of the Bisse\nwas nothing, it was like walking along a kerbstone, it was an exercise\nfor young ladies....\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nIn his younger days Benham had regarded Fear as a shameful secret and as\na thing to be got rid of altogether. It seemed to him that to feel fear\nwas to fall short of aristocracy, and in spite of the deep dreads\nand disgusts that haunted his mind, he set about the business of its\nsubjugation as if it were a spiritual amputation. But as he emerged\nfrom the egotism of adolescence he came to realize that this was\ntoo comprehensive an operation; every one feels fear, and your true\naristocrat is not one who has eliminated, but one who controls or\nignores it. Brave men are men who do things when they are afraid to do\nthem, just as Nelson, even when he was seasick, and he was frequently\nseasick, was still master of the sea. Benham developed two leading ideas\nabout fear; one that it is worse at the first onset, and far worse than\nany real experience, and the other that fear is essentially a social\ninstinct. He set himself upon these lines to study--what can we call\nit?--the taming of fear, the nature, care, and management of fear....\n\n\"Fear is very like pain in this, that it is a deterrent thing. It is\nsuperficial. Just as a man's skin is infinitely more sensitive than\nanything inside.... Once you have forced yourself or have been forced\nthrough the outward fear into vivid action or experience, you feel very\nlittle. The worst moment is before things happen. Rowe, the African\nsportsman, told me that he had seen cowardice often enough in the\npresence of lions, but he had never seen any one actually charged by a\nlion who did not behave well. I have heard the same thing of many sorts\nof dangers.\n\n\"I began to suspect this first in the case of falling or jumping down.\nGiddiness may be an almost intolerable torture, and falling nothing of\nthe sort. I once saw the face of an old man who had flung himself out\nof a high window in Rome, and who had been killed instantly on the\npavement; it was not simply a serene face, it was glad, exalted. I\nsuspect that when we have broken the shell of fear, falling may be\ndelightful. Jumping down is, after all, only a steeper tobogganing, and\ntobogganing a milder jumping down. Always I used to funk at the top\nof the Cresta run. I suffered sometimes almost intolerably; I found\nit almost impossible to get away. The first ten yards was like being\nslashed open with a sharp sword. But afterwards there was nothing but\njoyful thrills. All instinct, too, fought against me when I tried high\ndiving. I managed it, and began to like it. I had to give it up because\nof my ears, but not until I had established the habit of stepping\nthrough that moment of disinclination.\n\n\"I was Challoner's passenger when he was killed at Sheerness. That was\na queer unexpected experience, you may have supposed it an agony of\nterror, but indeed there was no fear in it at all. At any rate, I do not\nremember a moment of fear; it has gone clean out of my memory if ever it\nwas there. We were swimming high and fast, three thousand feet or so, in\na clear, sweet air over the town of Sheerness. The river, with a\nstring of battleships, was far away to the west of us, and the endless\ngrey-blue flats of the Thames to the north. The sun was low behind a\nbank of cloud. I was watching a motor-car, which seemed to be crawling\nslowly enough, though, no doubt, it was making a respectable pace,\nbetween two hedges down below. It is extraordinary how slowly everything\nseems to be going when one sees it from such an height.\n\n\"Then the left wing of the monoplane came up like a door that slams,\nsome wires whistled past my head, and one whipped off my helmet, and\nthen, with the seat slipping away from me, down we went. I snatched\nunavailingly for the helmet, and then gripped the sides. It was like\ndropping in a boat suddenly into the trough of a wave--and going on\ndropping. We were both strapped, and I got my feet against the side and\nclung to the locked second wheel.\n\n\"The sensation was as though something like an intermittent electric\ncurrent was pouring through me. It's a ridiculous image to use, I can't\njustify it, but it was as if I was having cold blue light squirted\nthrough every pore of my being. There was an astonishment, a feeling\nof confirmation. 'Of course these things do happen sometimes,' I told\nmyself. I don't remember that Challoner looked round or said anything at\nall. I am not sure that I looked at him....\n\n\"There seemed to be a long interval of intensely excited curiosity, and\nI remember thinking, 'Lord, but we shall come a smash in a minute!'\nFar ahead I saw the grey sheds of Eastchurch and people strolling\nabout apparently unaware of our disaster. There was a sudden silence as\nChalloner stopped the engine....\n\n\"But the point I want to insist upon is that I did not feel afraid. I\nwas simply enormously, terribly INTERESTED....\n\n\"There came a tremendous jolt and a lunge, and we were both tipped\nforward, so that we were hanging forehead down by our straps, and it\nlooked as if the sheds were in the sky, then I saw nothing but sky, then\ncame another vast swerve, and we were falling sideways, sideways....\n\n\"I was altogether out of breath and PHYSICALLY astonished, and I\nremember noting quite intelligently as we hit the ground how the green\ngrass had an effect of POURING OUT in every direction from below us....\n\n\"Then I remember a jerk and a feeling that I was flying up again. I was\nastonished by a tremendous popping--fabric, wires, everything seemed\ngoing pop, pop, pop, like a machine-gun, and then came a flash of\nintense pain as my arm crumpled up. It was quite impersonal pain. As\nimpersonal as seeing intense colour. SPLINTERS! I remember the word came\ninto my head instantly. I remember that very definitely.\n\n\"I thought, I suppose, my arm was in splinters. Or perhaps of the scraps\nand ends of rods and wires flying about us. It is curious that while I\nremember the word I cannot recall the idea....\n\n\"When I became conscious again the chief thing present in my mind was\nthat all those fellows round were young soldiers who wouldn't at all\nunderstand bad behaviour. My arm was--orchestral, but still far from\nbeing real suffering IN me. Also I wanted to know what Challoner had\ngot. They wouldn't understand my questions, and then I twisted round and\nsaw from the negligent way his feet came out from under the engine that\nhe must be dead. And dark red stains with bright red froth--\n\n\"Of course!\n\n\"There again the chief feeling was a sense of oddity. I wasn't sorry for\nhim any more than I was for myself.\n\n\"It seemed to me that it was all right with us both, remarkable, vivid,\nbut all right....\"\n\n\n\n8\n\n\n\"But though there is little or no fear in an aeroplane, even when it\nis smashing up, there is fear about aeroplanes. There is something that\nsays very urgently, 'Don't,' to the man who looks up into the sky. It\nis very interesting to note how at a place like Eastchurch or Brooklands\nthe necessary discretion trails the old visceral feeling with it,\nand how men will hang about, ready to go up, resolved to go up, but\ndelaying. Men of indisputable courage will get into a state between\ndread and laziness, and waste whole hours of flying weather on any\nexcuse or no excuse. Once they are up that inhibition vanishes. The man\nwho was delaying and delaying half an hour ago will now be cutting the\nmost venturesome capers in the air. Few men are in a hurry to get down\nagain. I mean that quite apart from the hesitation of landing, they like\nbeing up there.\"\n\nThen, abruptly, Benham comes back to his theory.\n\n\"Fear, you see, is the inevitable janitor, but it is not the ruler of\nexperience. That is what I am driving at in all this. The bark of danger\nis worse than its bite. Inside the portals there may be events and\ndestruction, but terror stays defeated at the door. It may be that when\nthat old man was killed by a horse the child who watched suffered more\nthan he did....\n\n\"I am sure that was so....\"\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nAs White read Benham's notes and saw how his argument drove on, he was\nreminded again and again of those schoolboy days and Benham's hardihood,\nand his own instinctive unreasonable reluctance to follow those gallant\nintellectual leads. If fear is an ancient instinctive boundary that the\nmodern life, the aristocratic life, is bound to ignore and transcend,\nmay this not also be the case with pain? We do a little adventure into\nthe \"life beyond fear\"; may we not also think of adventuring into the\nlife beyond pain? Is pain any saner a warning than fear? May not pain\njust as much as fear keep us from possible and splendid things? But why\nask a question that is already answered in principle in every dentist's\nchair? Benham's idea, however, went much further than that, he was\nclearly suggesting that in pain itself, pain endured beyond a certain\npitch, there might come pleasure again, an intensity of sensation\nthat might have the colour of delight. He betrayed a real anxiety to\ndemonstrate this possibility, he had the earnestness of a man who is\nsensible of dissentient elements within. He hated the thought of\npain even more than he hated fear. His arguments did not in the least\nconvince White, who stopped to poke the fire and assure himself of his\nown comfort in the midst of his reading.\n\nYoung people and unseasoned people, Benham argued, are apt to imagine\nthat if fear is increased and carried to an extreme pitch it becomes\nunbearable, one will faint or die; given a weak heart, a weak artery or\nany such structural defect and that may well happen, but it is just as\npossible that as the stimulation increases one passes through a brief\necstasy of terror to a new sane world, exalted but as sane as normal\nexistence. There is the calmness of despair. Benham had made some notes\nto enforce this view, of the observed calm behaviour of men already\nhopelessly lost, men on sinking ships, men going to execution, men\nalready maimed and awaiting the final stroke, but for the most part\nthese were merely references to books and periodicals. In exactly the\nsame way, he argued, we exaggerate the range of pain as if it were\nlimitless. We think if we are unthinking that it passes into agony and\nso beyond endurance to destruction. It probably does nothing of the\nkind. Benham compared pain to the death range of the electric current.\nAt a certain voltage it thrills, at a greater it torments and convulses,\nat a still greater it kills. But at enormous voltages, as Tesla was\nthe first to demonstrate, it does no injury. And following on this came\nmemoranda on the recorded behaviour of martyrs, on the self-torture of\nHindoo ascetics, of the defiance of Red Indian prisoners.\n\n\"These things,\" Benham had written, \"are much more horrible when one\nconsiders them from the point of view of an easy-chair\";--White gave\nan assenting nod--\"ARE THEY REALLY HORRIBLE AT ALL? Is it possible that\nthese charred and slashed and splintered persons, those Indians hanging\nfrom hooks, those walkers in the fiery furnace, have had glimpses\nthrough great windows that were worth the price they paid for them?\nHaven't we allowed those checks and barriers that are so important a\nrestraint upon childish enterprise, to creep up into and distress and\ndistort adult life?...\n\n\"The modern world thinks too much as though painlessness and freedom\nfrom danger were ultimate ends. It is fear-haunted, it is troubled\nby the thoughts of pain and death, which it has never met except as\nwell-guarded children meet these things, in exaggerated and untestable\nforms, in the menagerie or in nightmares. And so it thinks the discovery\nof anaesthetics the crowning triumph of civilization, and cosiness and\ninnocent amusement, those ideals of the nursery, the whole purpose of\nmankind....\"\n\n\"Mm,\" said White, and pressed his lips together and knotted his brows\nand shook his head.\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nBut the bulk of Benham's discussion of fear was not concerned with\nthis perverse and overstrained suggestion of pleasure reached through\ntorture, this exaggeration of the man resolved not to shrink at\nanything; it was an examination of the present range and use of fear\nthat led gradually to something like a theory of control and discipline.\nThe second of his two dominating ideas was that fear is an instinct\narising only in isolation, that in a crowd there may be a collective\npanic, but that there is no real individual fear. Fear, Benham held,\ndrives the man back to the crowd, the dog to its master, the wolf to the\npack, and when it is felt that the danger is pooled, then fear leaves\nus. He was quite prepared to meet the objection that animals of a\nsolitary habit do nevertheless exhibit fear. Some of this apparent fear,\nhe argued, was merely discretion, and what is not discretion is the\nsurvival of an infantile characteristic. The fear felt by a tiger cub\nis certainly a social emotion, that drives it back to the other cubs,\nto its mother and the dark hiding of the lair. The fear of a fully grown\ntiger sends it into the reeds and the shadows, to a refuge, that must be\n\"still reminiscent of the maternal lair.\" But fear has very little hold\nupon the adult solitary animal, it changes with extreme readiness to\nresentment and rage.\n\n\"Like most inexperienced people,\" ran his notes, \"I was astonished at\nthe reported feats of men in war; I believed they were exaggerated,\nand that there was a kind of unpremeditated conspiracy of silence about\ntheir real behaviour. But when on my way to visit India for the third\ntime I turned off to see what I could of the fighting before Adrianople,\nI discovered at once that a thousand casually selected conscripts will,\nevery one of them, do things together that not one of them could by any\nmeans be induced to do alone. I saw men not merely obey orders that\ngave them the nearly certain prospect of death, but I saw them exceeding\norders; I saw men leap out of cover for the mere sake of defiance, and\nfall shot through and smashed by a score of bullets. I saw a number\nof Bulgarians in the hands of the surgeon, several quite frightfully\nwounded, refuse chloroform merely to impress the English onlooker, some\nof their injuries I could scarcely endure to see, and I watched a line\nof infantry men go on up a hill and keep on quite manifestly cheerful\nwith men dropping out and wriggling, and men dropping out and lying\nstill until every other man was down.... Not one man would have gone up\nthat hill alone, without onlookers....\"\n\nRowe, the lion hunter, told Benham that only on one occasion in his life\nhad he given way to ungovernable fear, and that was when he was alone.\nMany times he had been in fearful situations in the face of charging\nlions and elephants, and once he had been bowled over and carried some\ndistance by a lion, but on none of these occasions had fear demoralized\nhim. There was no question of his general pluck. But on one occasion he\nwas lost in rocky waterless country in Somaliland. He strayed out in the\nearly morning while his camels were being loaded, followed some antelope\ntoo far, and lost his bearings. He looked up expecting to see the sun\non his right hand and found it on his left. He became bewildered. He\nwandered some time and then fired three signal shots and got no reply.\nThen losing his head he began shouting. He had only four or five more\ncartridges and no water-bottle. His men were accustomed to his going on\nalone, and might not begin to remark upon his absence until sundown....\nIt chanced, however, that one of the shikari noted the water-bottle he\nhad left behind and organized a hunt for him.\n\nLong before they found him he had passed to an extremity of terror. The\nworld had become hideous and threatening, the sun was a pitiless glare,\neach rocky ridge he clambered became more dreadful than the last, each\nnew valley into which he looked more hateful and desolate, the cramped\nthorn bushes threatened him gauntly, the rocks had a sinister lustre,\nand in every blue shadow about him the night and death lurked and\nwaited. There was no hurry for them, presently they would spread out\nagain and join and submerge him, presently in the confederated darkness\nhe could be stalked and seized and slain. Yes, this he admitted was real\nfear. He had cracked his voice, yelling as a child yells. And then he\nhad become afraid of his own voice....\n\n\"Now this excess of fear in isolation, this comfort in a crowd, in\nsupport and in a refuge, even when support or refuge is quite illusory,\nis just exactly what one would expect of fear if one believed it to be\nan instinct which has become a misfit. In the ease of the soldier fear\nis so much a misfit that instead of saving him for the most part it\ndestroys him. Raw soldiers under fire bunch together and armies fight in\nmasses, men are mowed down in swathes, because only so is the courage of\nthe common men sustained, only so can they be brave, albeit spread out\nand handling their weapons as men of unqualified daring would handle\nthem they would be infinitely safer and more effective....\n\n\"And all of us, it may be, are restrained by this misfit fear from a\nthousand bold successful gestures of mind and body, we are held back\nfrom the attainment of mighty securities in pitiful temporary shelters\nthat are perhaps in the end no better than traps....\"\n\nFrom such considerations Benham went on to speculate how far the crowd\ncan be replaced in a man's imagination, how far some substitute for that\nsocial backing can be made to serve the same purpose in neutralizing\nfear. He wrote with the calm of a man who weighs the probabilities of a\nriddle, and with the zeal of a man lost to every material consideration.\nHis writing, it seemed to White, had something of the enthusiastic\nwhiteness of his face, the enthusiastic brightness of his eyes. We can\nno more banish fear from our being at present than we can carve out the\nfleshy pillars of the heart or the pineal gland in the brain. It is deep\nin our inheritance. As deep as hunger. And just as we have to satisfy\nhunger in order that it should leave us free, so we have to satisfy the\nunconquerable importunity of fear. We have to reassure our faltering\ninstincts. There must be something to take the place of lair and\nfamiliars, something not ourselves but general, that we must carry with\nus into the lonely places. For it is true that man has now not only\nto learn to fight in open order instead of in a phalanx, but he has to\nthink and plan and act in open order, to live in open order....\n\nThen with one of his abrupt transitions Benham had written, \"This brings\nme to God.\"\n\n\"The devil it does!\" said White, roused to a keener attention.\n\n\"By no feat of intention can we achieve courage in loneliness so long as\nwe feel indeed alone. An isolated man, an egoist, an Epicurean man, will\nalways fail himself in the solitary place. There must be something more\nwith us to sustain us against this vast universe than the spark of life\nthat began yesterday and must be extinguished to-morrow. There can be\nno courage beyond social courage, the sustaining confidence of the herd,\nuntil there is in us the sense of God. But God is a word that covers a\nmultitude of meanings. When I was a boy I was a passionate atheist, I\ndefied God, and so far as God is the mere sanction of social traditions\nand pressures, a mere dressing up of the crowd's will in canonicals, I\ndo still deny him and repudiate him. That God I heard of first from my\nnursemaid, and in very truth he is the proper God of all the nursemaids\nof mankind. But there is another God than that God of obedience, God the\nimmortal adventurer in me, God who calls men from home and country, God\nscourged and crowned with thorns, who rose in a nail-pierced body out of\ndeath and came not to bring peace but a sword.\"\n\nWith something bordering upon intellectual consternation, White, who\nwas a decent self-respecting sceptic, read these last clamberings of\nBenham's spirit. They were written in pencil; they were unfinished when\nhe died.\n\n(Surely the man was not a Christian!)\n\n\"You may be heedless of death and suffering because you think you cannot\nsuffer and die, or you may be heedless of death and pain because you\nhave identified your life with the honour of mankind and the insatiable\nadventurousness of man's imagination, so that the possible death is\nnegligible and the possible achievement altogether outweighs it.\"...\n\nWhite shook his head over these pencilled fragments.\n\nHe was a member of the Rationalist Press Association, and he had always\ntaken it for granted that Benham was an orthodox unbeliever. But this\nwas hopelessly unsound, heresy, perilous stuff; almost, it seemed to\nhim, a posthumous betrayal....\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nOne night when he was in India the spirit of adventure came upon Benham.\nHe had gone with Kepple, of the forestry department, into the jungle\ncountry in the hills above the Tapti. He had been very anxious to see\nsomething of that aspect of Indian life, and he had snatched at the\nchance Kepple had given him. But they had scarcely started before the\nexpedition was brought to an end by an accident, Kepple was thrown by\na pony and his ankle broken. He and Benham bandaged it as well as they\ncould, and a litter was sent for, and meanwhile they had to wait in the\ncamp that was to have been the centre of their jungle raids. The second\nday of this waiting was worse for Kepple than the first, and he suffered\nmuch from the pressure of this amateurish bandaging. In the evening\nBenham got cool water from the well and rearranged things better; the\ntwo men dined and smoked under their thatched roof beneath the big\nbanyan, and then Kepple, tired out by his day of pain, was carried to\nhis tent. Presently he fell asleep and Benham was left to himself.\n\nNow that the heat was over he found himself quite indisposed to sleep.\nHe felt full of life and anxious for happenings.\n\nHe went back and sat down upon the iron bedstead beneath the banyan,\nthat Kepple had lain upon through the day, and he watched the soft\nimmensity of the Indian night swallow up the last lingering colours of\nthe world. It left the outlines, it obliterated nothing, but it stripped\noff the superficial reality of things. The moon was full and high\noverhead, and the light had not so much gone as changed from definition\nand the blazing glitter and reflections of solidity to a translucent and\nunsubstantial clearness. The jungle that bordered the little encampment\nnorth, south, and west seemed to have crept a little nearer, enriched\nitself with blackness, taken to itself voices.\n\n(Surely it had been silent during the day.)\n\nA warm, faintly-scented breeze just stirred the dead grass and the\nleaves. In the day the air had been still.\n\nImmediately after the sunset there had been a great crying of peacocks\nin the distance, but that was over now; the crickets, however,\nwere still noisy, and a persistent sound had become predominant, an\nindustrious unmistakable sound, a sound that took his mind back to\nEngland, in midsummer. It was like a watchman's rattle--a nightjar!\n\nSo there were nightjars here in India, too! One might have expected\nsomething less familiar. And then came another cry from far away over\nthe heat-stripped tree-tops, a less familiar cry. It was repeated. Was\nthat perhaps some craving leopard, a tiger cat, a panther?--\n\n\"HUNT, HUNT\"; that might be a deer.\n\nThen suddenly an angry chattering came from the dark trees quite close\nat hand. A monkey?...\n\nThese great, scarce visible, sweeping movements through the air were\nbats....\n\nOf course, the day jungle is the jungle asleep. This was its waking\nhour. Now the deer were arising from their forms, the bears creeping\nout of their dens amidst the rocks and blundering down the gullies,\nthe tigers and panthers and jungle cats stalking noiselessly from their\nlairs in the grass. Countless creatures that had hidden from the heat\nand pitiless exposure of the day stood now awake and alertly intent upon\ntheir purposes, grazed or sought water, flitting delicately through the\nmoonlight and shadows. The jungle was awakening. Again Benham heard that\nsound like the belling of a stag....\n\nThis was the real life of the jungle, this night life, into which man\ndid not go. Here he was on the verge of a world that for all the stuffed\ntrophies of the sportsman and the specimens of the naturalist is still\nalmost as unknown as if it was upon another planet. What intruders men\nare, what foreigners in the life of this ancient system!\n\nHe looked over his shoulder, and there were the two little tents,\none that sheltered Kepple and one that awaited him, and beyond, in an\nirregular line, glowed the ruddy smoky fires of the men. One or two\nturbaned figures still flitted about, and there was a voice--low,\nmonotonous--it must have been telling a tale. Further, sighing and\nstirring ever and again, were tethered beasts, and then a great pale\nspace of moonlight and the clumsy outlines of the village well. The\nclustering village itself slept in darkness beyond the mango trees,\nand still remoter the black encircling jungle closed in. One might have\nfancied this was the encampment of newly-come invaders, were it not\nfor the larger villages that are overgrown with thickets and altogether\nswallowed up again in the wilderness, and for the deserted temples that\nare found rent asunder by the roots of trees and the ancient embankments\nthat hold water only for the drinking of the sambur deer....\n\nBenham turned his face to the dim jungle again....\n\nHe had come far out of his way to visit this strange world of the\nancient life, that now recedes and dwindles before our new civilization,\nthat seems fated to shrivel up and pass altogether before the dry\nadvance of physical science and material organization. He was full of\nunsatisfied curiosities about its fierce hungers and passions, its fears\nand cruelties, its instincts and its well-nigh incommunicable and yet\nmost precious understandings. He had long ceased to believe that the\nwild beast is wholly evil, and safety and plenty the ultimate good for\nmen....\n\nPerhaps he would never get nearer to this mysterious jungle life than he\nwas now.\n\nIt was intolerably tantalizing that it should be so close at hand and so\ninaccessible....\n\nAs Benham sat brooding over his disappointment the moon, swimming on\nthrough the still circle of the hours, passed slowly over him. The\nlights and shadows about him changed by imperceptible gradations and\na long pale alley where the native cart track drove into the forest,\nopened slowly out of the darkness, slowly broadened, slowly lengthened.\nIt opened out to him with a quality of invitation....\n\nThere was the jungle before him. Was it after all so inaccessible?\n\n\"Come!\" the road said to him.\n\nBenham rose and walked out a few paces into the moonlight and stood\nmotionless.\n\nWas he afraid?\n\nEven now some hungry watchful monster might lurk in yonder shadows,\nwatching with infinite still patience. Kepple had told him how they\nwould sit still for hours--staring unblinkingly as cats stare at a\nfire--and then crouch to advance. Beneath the shrill overtone of\nthe nightjars, what noiseless grey shapes, what deep breathings and\ncracklings and creepings might there not be?...\n\nWas he afraid?\n\nThat question determined him to go.\n\nHe hesitated whether he should take a gun. A stick? A gun, he knew, was\na dangerous thing to an inexperienced man. No! He would go now, even as\nhe was with empty hands. At least he would go as far as the end of that\nband of moonlight. If for no other reason than because he was afraid.\nNOW!\n\nFor a moment it seemed to him as though his feet were too heavy to lift\nand then, hands in pockets, khaki-clad, an almost invisible figure, he\nstrolled towards the cart-track.\n\nCome to that, he halted for a moment to regard the distant fires of\nthe men. No one would miss him. They would think he was in his tent.\nHe faced the stirring quiet ahead. The cart-track was a rutted path of\nsoft, warm sand, on which he went almost noiselessly. A bird squabbled\nfor an instant in a thicket. A great white owl floated like a flake of\nmoonlight across the track and vanished without a sound among the trees.\n\nAlong the moonlit path went Benham, and when he passed near trees his\nfootsteps became noisy with the rustle and crash of dead leaves. The\njungle was full of moonlight; twigs, branches, creepers, grass-clumps\ncame out acutely vivid. The trees and bushes stood in pools of darkness,\nand beyond were pale stretches of misty moonshine and big rocks shining\nwith an unearthly lustre. Things seemed to be clear and yet uncertain.\nIt was as if they dissolved or retired a little and then returned to\nsolidity.\n\nA sudden chattering broke out overhead, and black across the great\nstars soared a flying squirrel and caught a twig, and ran for shelter.\nA second hesitated in a tree-top and pursued. They chased each other and\nvanished abruptly. He forgot his sense of insecurity in the interest of\nthese active little silhouettes. And he noted how much bigger and more\nwonderful the stars can look when one sees them through interlacing\nbranches.\n\nAhead was darkness; but not so dark when he came to it that the track\nwas invisible. He was at the limit of his intention, but now he saw that\nthat had been a childish project. He would go on, he would walk right\ninto the jungle. His first disinclination was conquered, and the soft\nintoxication of the subtropical moonshine was in his blood.... But he\nwished he could walk as a spirit walks, without this noise of leaves....\n\nYes, this was very wonderful and beautiful, and there must always be\njungles for men to walk in. Always there must be jungles....\n\nSome small beast snarled and bolted from under his feet. He stopped\nsharply. He had come into a darkness under great boughs, and now he\nstood still as the little creature scuttled away. Beyond the track\nemerged into a dazzling whiteness....\n\nIn the stillness he could hear the deer belling again in the distance,\nand then came a fuss of monkeys in a group of trees near at hand. He\nremained still until this had died away into mutterings.\n\nThen on the verge of movement he was startled by a ripe mango that\nslipped from its stalk and fell out of the tree and struck his hand.\nIt took a little time to understand that, and then he laughed, and his\nmuscles relaxed, and he went on again.\n\nA thorn caught at him and he disentangled himself.\n\nHe crossed the open space, and the moon was like a great shield of light\nspread out above him. All the world seemed swimming in its radiance. The\nstars were like lamps in a mist of silvery blue.\n\nThe track led him on across white open spaces of shrivelled grass and\nsand, amidst trees where shadows made black patternings upon the silver,\nand then it plunged into obscurities. For a time it lifted, and then\non one hand the bush fell away, and he saw across a vast moonlit valley\nwide undulations of open cultivation, belts of jungle, copses, and a\ngreat lake as black as ebony. For a time the path ran thus open, and\nthen the jungle closed in again and there were more thickets, more\nlevels of grass, and in one place far overhead among the branches he\nheard and stood for a time perplexed at a vast deep humming of bees....\n\nPresently a black monster with a hunched back went across his path\nheedless of him and making a great noise in the leaves. He stood quite\nstill until it had gone. He could not tell whether it was a boar or\nhyaena; most probably, he thought, a boar because of the heaviness of\nits rush.\n\nThe path dropped downhill for a time, crossed a ravine, ascended. He\npassed a great leafless tree on which there were white flowers. On the\nground also, in the darkness under the tree, there were these flowers;\nthey were dropping noiselessly, and since they were visible in the\nshadows, it seemed to him that they must be phosphorescent. And they\nemitted a sweetish scent that lay heavily athwart the path. Presently he\npassed another such tree. Then he became aware of a tumult ahead of him,\na smashing of leaves, a snorting and slobbering, grunting and sucking,\na whole series of bestial sounds. He halted for a little while, and then\ndrew nearer, picking his steps to avoid too great a noise. Here were\nmore of those white-blossomed trees, and beneath, in the darkness,\nsomething very black and big was going to and fro, eating greedily. Then\nhe found that there were two and then more of these black things, three\nor four of them.\n\nCuriosity made Benham draw nearer, very softly.\n\nPresently one showed in a patch of moonlight, startlingly big, a huge,\nblack hairy monster with a long white nose on a grotesque face, and he\nwas stuffing armfuls of white blossom into his mouth with his curved\nfore claws. He took not the slightest notice of the still man, who stood\nperhaps twenty yards away from him. He was too blind and careless. He\nsnorted and smacked his slobbering lips, and plunged into the shadows\nagain. Benham heard him root among the leaves and grunt appreciatively.\nThe air was heavy with the reek of the crushed flowers.\n\nFor some time Benham remained listening to and peering at these\npreoccupied gluttons. At last he shrugged his shoulders, and left them\nand went on his way. For a long time he could hear them, then just as he\nwas on the verge of forgetting them altogether, some dispute arose among\nthem, and there began a vast uproar, squeals, protests, comments, one\nvoice ridiculously replete and authoritative, ridiculously suggestive\nof a drunken judge with his mouth full, and a shrill voice of grievance\nhigh above the others....\n\nThe uproar of the bears died away at last, almost abruptly, and left the\njungle to the incessant night-jars....\n\nFor what end was this life of the jungle?\n\nAll Benham's senses were alert to the sounds and appearances about him,\nand at the same time his mind was busy with the perplexities of that\nriddle. Was the jungle just an aimless pool of life that man must drain\nand clear away? Or is it to have a use in the greater life of our race\nthat now begins? Will man value the jungle as he values the precipice,\nfor the sake of his manhood? Will he preserve it?\n\nMan must keep hard, man must also keep fierce. Will the jungle keep him\nfierce?\n\nFor life, thought Benham, there must be insecurity....\n\nHe had missed the track....\n\nHe was now in a second ravine. He was going downward, walking on silvery\nsand amidst great boulders, and now there was a new sound in the\nair--. It was the croaking of frogs. Ahead was a solitary gleam. He was\napproaching a jungle pool....\n\nSuddenly the stillness was alive, in a panic uproar. \"HONK!\" cried a\ngreat voice, and \"HONK!\" There was a clatter of hoofs, a wild rush--a\nrush as it seemed towards him. Was he being charged? He backed against a\nrock. A great pale shape leaped by him, an antlered shape. It was a herd\nof big deer bolting suddenly out of the stillness. He heard the swish\nand smash of their retreat grow distant, disperse. He remained standing\nwith his back to the rock.\n\nSlowly the strophe and antistrophe of frogs and goat-suckers resumed\npossession of his consciousness. But now some primitive instinct\nperhaps or some subconscious intimation of danger made him meticulously\nnoiseless.\n\nHe went on down a winding sound-deadening path of sand towards the\ndrinking-place. He came to a wide white place that was almost level, and\nbeyond it under clustering pale-stemmed trees shone the mirror surface\nof some ancient tank, and, sharp and black, a dog-like beast sat on its\ntail in the midst of this space, started convulsively and went slinking\ninto the undergrowth. Benham paused for a moment and then walked out\nsoftly into the light, and, behold! as if it were to meet him, came\na monster, a vast dark shape drawing itself lengthily out of the\nblackness, and stopped with a start as if it had been instantly changed\nto stone.\n\nIt had stopped with one paw advanced. Its striped mask was light and\ndark grey in the moonlight, grey but faintly tinged with ruddiness; its\nmouth was a little open, its fangs and a pendant of viscous saliva shone\nvivid. Its great round-pupilled eyes regarded him stedfastly. At last\nthe nightmare of Benham's childhood had come true, and he was face to\nface with a tiger, uncaged, uncontrolled.\n\nFor some moments neither moved, neither the beast nor the man. They\nstood face to face, each perhaps with an equal astonishment, motionless\nand soundless, in that mad Indian moonlight that makes all things like a\ndream.\n\nBenham stood quite motionless, and body and mind had halted together.\nThat confrontation had an interminableness that had nothing to do with\nthe actual passage of time. Then some trickle of his previous thoughts\nstirred in the frozen quiet of his mind.\n\nHe spoke hoarsely. \"I am Man,\" he said, and lifted a hand as he spoke.\n\"The Thought of the world.\"\n\nHis heart leapt within him as the tiger moved. But the great beast\nwent sideways, gardant, only that its head was low, three noiseless\ninstantaneous strides it made, and stood again watching him.\n\n\"Man,\" he said, in a voice that had no sound, and took a step forward.\n\n\"Wough!\" With two bounds the monster had become a great grey streak\nthat crackled and rustled in the shadows of the trees. And then it\nhad vanished, become invisible and inaudible with a kind of\ninstantaneousness.\n\nFor some seconds or some minutes Benham stood rigid, fearlessly\nexpectant, and then far away up the ravine he heard the deer repeat\ntheir cry of alarm, and understood with a new wisdom that the tiger had\npassed among them and was gone....\n\nHe walked on towards the deserted tank and now he was talking aloud.\n\n\"I understand the jungle. I understand.... If a few men die here, what\nmatter? There are worse deaths than being killed....\n\n\"What is this fool's trap of security?\n\n\"Every time in my life that I have fled from security I have fled from\ndeath....\n\n\"Let men stew in their cities if they will. It is in the lonely places,\nin jungles and mountains, in snows and fires, in the still observatories\nand the silent laboratories, in those secret and dangerous places where\nlife probes into life, it is there that the masters of the world, the\nlords of the beast, the rebel sons of Fate come to their own....\n\n\"You sleeping away there in the cities! Do you know what it means for\nyou that I am here to-night?\n\n\"Do you know what it means to you?\n\n\"I am just one--just the precursor.\n\n\"Presently, if you will not budge, those hot cities must be burnt about\nyou. You must come out of them....\"\n\nHe wandered now uttering his thoughts as they came to him, and he saw no\nmore living creatures because they fled and hid before the sound of his\nvoice. He wandered until the moon, larger now and yellow tinged, was low\nbetween the black bars of the tree stems. And then it sank very suddenly\nbehind a hilly spur and the light failed swiftly.\n\nHe stumbled and went with difficulty. He could go no further among these\nrocks and ravines, and he sat down at the foot of a tree to wait for\nday.\n\nHe sat very still indeed.\n\nA great stillness came over the world, a velvet silence that wrapped\nabout him, as the velvet shadows wrapped about him. The corncrakes had\nceased, all the sounds and stir of animal life had died away, the breeze\nhad fallen. A drowsing comfort took possession of him. He grew more\nplacid and more placid still. He was enormously content to find that\nfear had fled before him and was gone. He drifted into that state of\nmind when one thinks without ideas, when one's mind is like a starless\nsky, serene and empty.\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nSome hours later Benham found that the trees and rocks were growing\nvisible again, and he saw a very bright star that he knew must be\nLucifer rising amidst the black branches. He was sitting upon a rock at\nthe foot of a slender-stemmed leafless tree. He had been asleep, and it\nwas daybreak. Everything was coldly clear and colourless.\n\nHe must have slept soundly.\n\nHe heard a cock crow, and another answer--jungle fowl these must be,\nbecause there could be no village within earshot--and then far away and\nbringing back memories of terraced houses and ripe walled gardens, was\nthe scream of peacocks. And some invisible bird was making a hollow\nbeating sound among the trees near at hand. TUNK.... TUNK, and out of\nthe dry grass came a twittering.\n\nThere was a green light in the east that grew stronger, and the stars\nafter their magnitudes were dissolving in the blue; only a few remained\nfaintly visible. The sound of birds increased. Through the trees he saw\ntowering up a great mauve thing like the back of a monster,--but that\nwas nonsense, it was the crest of a steep hillside covered with woods of\nteak.\n\nHe stood up and stretched himself, and wondered whether he had dreamed\nof a tiger.\n\nHe tried to remember and retrace the course of his over-night\nwanderings.\n\nA flight of emerald parakeets tore screaming through the trees, and then\nfar away uphill he heard the creaking of a cart.\n\nHe followed the hint of a footmark, and went back up the glen slowly and\nthoughtfully.\n\nPresently he came to a familiar place, a group of trees, a sheet of\nwater, and the ruins of an old embankment. It was the ancient tank of\nhis overnight encounter. The pool of his dream?\n\nWith doubt still in his mind, he walked round its margin to the sandy\nlevel beyond, and cast about and sought intently, and at last found, and\nthen found clearly, imposed upon the tracks of several sorts of deer and\nthe footprints of many biggish birds, first the great spoor of the\ntiger and then his own. Here the beast had halted, and here it had leapt\naside. Here his own footmarks stopped. Here his heels had come together.\n\nIt had been no dream.\n\nThere was a white mist upon the water of the old tank like the bloom\nupon a plum, and the trees about it seemed smaller and the sand-space\nwider and rougher than they had seemed in the moonshine. Then the ground\nhad looked like a floor of frosted silver.\n\nAnd thence he went on upward through the fresh morning, until just as\nthe east grew red with sunrise, he reached the cart-track from which he\nhad strayed overnight. It was, he found, a longer way back to the camp\nthan he remembered it to be. Perhaps he had struck the path further\nalong. It curved about and went up and down and crossed three ravines.\nAt last he came to that trampled place of littered white blossom under\ngreat trees where he had seen the bears.\n\nThe sunlight went before him in a sheaf of golden spears, and his\nshadow, that was at first limitless, crept towards his feet. The dew had\ngone from the dead grass and the sand was hot to his dry boots before he\ncame back into the open space about the great banyan and the tents. And\nKepple, refreshed by a night's rest and coffee, was wondering loudly\nwhere the devil he had gone.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE STORY\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FIRST ~~ THE BOY GROWS UP\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nBenham was the son of a schoolmaster. His father was assistant first at\nCheltenham, and subsequently at Minchinghampton, and then he became\nhead and later on sole proprietor of Martindale House, a high-class\npreparatory school at Seagate. He was extremely successful for some\nyears, as success goes in the scholastic profession, and then disaster\novertook him in the shape of a divorce. His wife, William Porphyry's\nmother, made the acquaintance of a rich young man named Nolan, who was\nrecuperating at Seagate from the sequelae of snake-bite, malaria, and a\ngun accident in Brazil. She ran away with him, and she was divorced.\nShe was, however, unable to marry him because he died at Wiesbaden\nonly three days after the Reverend Harold Benham obtained his decree\nabsolute. Instead, therefore, being a woman of great spirit, enterprise\nand sweetness, she married Godfrey Marayne, afterwards Sir Godfrey\nMarayne, the great London surgeon.\n\nNolan was a dark, rather melancholy and sentimental young man, and he\nleft about a third of his very large fortune entirely to Mrs. Benham\nand the rest to her in trust for her son, whom he deemed himself to have\ninjured. With this and a husband already distinguished, she returned\npresently to London, and was on the whole fairly well received there.\n\nIt was upon the reverend gentleman at Seagate that the brunt of this\ndivorce fell. There is perhaps a certain injustice in the fact that a\nschoolmaster who has lost his wife should also lose the more valuable\nproportion of his pupils, but the tone of thought in England is against\nany association of a schoolmaster with matrimonial irregularity. And\nalso Mr. Benham remarried. It would certainly have been better for him\nif he could have produced a sister. His school declined and his efforts\nto resuscitate it only hastened its decay. Conceiving that he could now\nonly appeal to the broader-minded, more progressive type of parent,\nhe became an educational reformer, and wrote upon modernizing the\ncurriculum with increasing frequency to the TIMES. He expended a\nconsiderable fraction of his dwindling capital upon a science laboratory\nand a fives court; he added a London Bachelor of Science with a Teaching\nDiploma to the school staff, and a library of about a thousand volumes,\nincluding the Hundred Best Books as selected by the late Lord Avebury,\nto the school equipment. None of these things did anything but enhance\nthe suspicion of laxity his wife's escapade had created in the limited\nopulent and discreet class to which his establishment appealed. One\nboy who, under the influence of the Hundred Best Books, had quoted the\nZEND-AVESTA to an irascible but influential grandfather, was withdrawn\nwithout notice or compensation in the middle of the term. It intensifies\nthe tragedy of the Reverend Harold Benham's failure that in no\nessential respect did his school depart from the pattern of all other\nproperly-conducted preparatory schools.\n\nIn appearance he was near the average of scholastic English gentlemen.\nHe displayed a manifest handsomeness somewhat weakened by disregard and\ndisuse, a large moustache and a narrow high forehead. His rather\ntired brown eyes were magnified by glasses. He was an active man in\nunimportant things, with a love for the phrase \"ship-shape,\" and he\nplayed cricket better than any one else on the staff. He walked in wide\nstrides, and would sometimes use the tail of his gown on the blackboard.\nLike so many clergymen and schoolmasters, he had early distrusted\nhis natural impulse in conversation, and had adopted the defensive\nprecaution of a rather formal and sonorous speech, which habit had made\na part of him. His general effect was of one who is earnestly keeping up\nthings that might otherwise give way, keeping them up by act and voice,\nkeeping up an atmosphere of vigour and success in a school that was\nonly too manifestly attenuated, keeping up a pretentious economy of\nadministration in a school that must not be too manifestly impoverished,\nkeeping up a claim to be in the scientific van and rather a flutterer\nof dovecots--with its method of manual training for example--keeping up\nESPRIT DE CORPS and the manliness of himself and every one about him,\nkeeping up his affection for his faithful second wife and his complete\nforgetfulness of and indifference to that spirit of distracting impulse\nand insubordination away there in London, who had once been his delight\nand insurmountable difficulty. \"After my visits to her,\" wrote Benham,\n\"he would show by a hundred little expressions and poses and acts how\nintensely he wasn't noting that anything of the sort had occurred.\"\n\nBut one thing that from the outset the father seemed to have failed to\nkeep up thoroughly was his intention to mould and dominate his son.\n\nThe advent of his boy had been a tremendous event in the reverend\ngentleman's life. It is not improbable that his disposition to\nmonopolize the pride of this event contributed to the ultimate\ndisruption of his family. It left so few initiatives within the home to\nhis wife. He had been an early victim to that wave of philoprogenitive\nand educational enthusiasm which distinguished the closing decade of the\nnineteenth century. He was full of plans in those days for the education\nof his boy, and the thought of the youngster played a large part in\nthe series of complicated emotional crises with which he celebrated\nthe departure of his wife, crises in which a number of old school and\ncollege friends very generously assisted--spending weekends at Seagate\nfor this purpose, and mingling tobacco, impassioned handclasps and\nsuchlike consolation with much patient sympathetic listening to his\ncarefully balanced analysis of his feelings. He declared that his son\nwas now his one living purpose in life, and he sketched out a scheme of\nmoral and intellectual training that he subsequently embodied in five\nvery stimulating and intimate articles for the SCHOOL WORLD, but never\nput into more than partial operation.\n\n\"I have read my father's articles upon this subject,\" wrote Benham,\n\"and I am still perplexed to measure just what I owe to him. Did he ever\nattempt this moral training he contemplated so freely? I don't think\nhe did. I know now, I knew then, that he had something in his mind....\nThere were one or two special walks we had together, he invited me\nto accompany him with a certain portentousness, and we would go out\npregnantly making superficial remarks about the school cricket and\nreturn, discussing botany, with nothing said.\n\n\"His heart failed him.\n\n\"Once or twice, too, he seemed to be reaching out at me from the school\npulpit.\n\n\"I think that my father did manage to convey to me his belief that there\nwere these fine things, honour, high aims, nobilities. If I did not get\nthis belief from him then I do not know how I got it. But it was as if\nhe hinted at a treasure that had got very dusty in an attic, a treasure\nwhich he hadn't himself been able to spend....\"\n\nThe father who had intended to mould his son ended by watching him grow,\nnot always with sympathy or understanding. He was an overworked man\nassailed by many futile anxieties. One sees him striding about the\nestablishment with his gown streaming out behind him urging on the\ngroundsman or the gardener, or dignified, expounding the particular\nadvantages of Seagate to enquiring parents, one sees him unnaturally\ncheerful and facetious at the midday dinner table, one imagines him\nkeeping up high aspirations in a rather too hastily scribbled sermon in\nthe school pulpit, or keeping up an enthusiasm for beautiful language in\na badly-prepared lesson on Virgil, or expressing unreal indignation and\nunjustifiably exalted sentiments to evil doers, and one realizes his\ndisadvantage against the quiet youngster whose retentive memory was\nstoring up all these impressions for an ultimate judgment, and one\nunderstands, too, a certain relief that mingled with his undeniable\nemotion when at last the time came for young Benham, \"the one living\npurpose\" of his life, to be off to Minchinghampton and the next step in\nthe mysterious ascent of the English educational system.\n\nThree times at least, and with an increased interval, the father wrote\nfine fatherly letters that would have stood the test of publication.\nThen his communications became comparatively hurried and matter-of-fact.\nHis boy's return home for the holidays was always rather a stirring time\nfor his private feelings, but he became more and more inexpressive. He\nwould sometimes lay a hand on those growing shoulders and then withdraw\nit. They felt braced-up shoulders, stiffly inflexible or--they would\nwince. And when one has let the habit of indefinite feelings grow upon\none, what is there left to say? If one did say anything one might be\nasked questions....\n\nOne or two of the long vacations they spent abroad together. The last\nof these occasions followed Benham's convalescence at Montana and his\nstruggle with the Bisse; the two went to Zermatt and did several peaks\nand crossed the Theodule, and it was clear that their joint expeditions\nwere a strain upon both of them. The father thought the son reckless,\nunskilful, and impatient; the son found the father's insistence upon\nguides, ropes, precautions, the recognized way, the highest point and\nback again before you get a chill, and talk about it sagely but very,\nvery modestly over pipes, tiresome. He wanted to wander in deserts of\nice and see over the mountains, and discover what it is to be benighted\non a precipice. And gradually he was becoming familiar with his father's\nrepertory of Greek quotations. There was no breach between them, but\neach knew that holiday was the last they would ever spend together....\n\nThe court had given the custody of young William Porphyry into his\nfather's hands, but by a generous concession it was arranged that his\nmother should have him to see her for an hour or so five times a year.\nThe Nolan legacy, however, coming upon the top of this, introduced\na peculiar complication that provided much work for tactful\nintermediaries, and gave great and increasing scope for painful\ndelicacies on the part of Mr. Benham as the boy grew up.\n\n\"I see,\" said the father over his study pipe and with his glasses fixed\non remote distances above the head of the current sympathizer, \"I see\nmore and more clearly that the tale of my sacrifices is not yet at an\nend.... In many respects he is like her.... Quick. Too quick.... He must\nchoose. But I know his choice. Yes, yes,--I'm not blind. She's worked\nupon him.... I have done what I could to bring out the manhood in him.\nPerhaps it will bear the strain.... It will be a wrench, old man--God\nknows.\"\n\nHe did his very best to make it a wrench.\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nBenham's mother, whom he saw quarterly and also on the first of May,\nbecause it was her birthday, touched and coloured his imagination far\nmore than his father did. She was now Lady Marayne, and a prominent,\nsuccessful, and happy little lady. Her dereliction had been forgiven\nquite soon, and whatever whisper of it remained was very completely\nforgotten during the brief period of moral kindliness which followed\nthe accession of King Edward the Seventh. It no doubt contributed to\nher social reinstatement that her former husband was entirely devoid\nof social importance, while, on the other hand, Sir Godfrey Marayne's\ntemporary monopoly of the caecal operation which became so fashionable\nin the last decade of Queen Victoria's reign as to be practically\nepidemic, created a strong feeling in her favour.\n\nShe was blue-eyed and very delicately complexioned, quick-moving, witty,\ngiven to little storms of clean enthusiasm; she loved handsome things,\nbrave things, successful things, and the respect and affection of all\nthe world. She did quite what she liked upon impulse, and nobody ever\nthought ill of her.\n\nHer family were the Mantons of Blent, quite good west-country people.\nShe had broken away from them before she was twenty to marry Benham,\nwhom she had idealized at a tennis party. He had talked of his work and\nshe had seen it in a flash, the noblest work in the world, him at\nhis daily divine toil and herself a Madonna surrounded by a troupe of\nBlessed Boys--all of good family, some of quite the best. For a time she\nhad kept it up even more than he had, and then Nolan had distracted her\nwith a realization of the heroism that goes to the ends of the earth.\nShe became sick with desire for the forests of Brazil, and the Pacific,\nand--a peak in Darien. Immediately the school was frowsty beyond\nendurance, and for the first time she let herself perceive how\ndreadfully a gentleman and a scholar can smell of pipes and tobacco.\nOnly one course lay open to a woman of spirit....\n\nFor a year she did indeed live like a woman of spirit, and it was at\nNolan's bedside that Marayne was first moved to admiration. She was\nplucky. All men love a plucky woman.\n\nSir Godfrey Marayne smelt a good deal of antiseptic soap, but he talked\nin a way that amused her, and he trusted as well as adored her. She did\nwhat she liked with his money, her own money, and her son's trust money,\nand she did very well. From the earliest Benham's visits were to a\ngracious presence amidst wealthy surroundings. The transit from the\nmoral blamelessness of Seagate had an entirely misleading effect of\nascent.\n\nTheir earlier encounters became rather misty in his memory; they\noccurred at various hotels in Seagate. Afterwards he would go, first\ntaken by a governess, and later going alone, to Charing Cross, where he\nwould be met, in earlier times by a maid and afterwards by a deferential\nmanservant who called him \"Sir,\" and conveyed, sometimes in a hansom cab\nand later in a smart brougham, by Trafalgar Square, Lower Regent Street,\nPiccadilly, and streets of increasing wealth and sublimity to Sir\nGodfrey's house in Desborough Street. Very naturally he fell into\nthinking of these discreet and well-governed West End streets as a part\nof his mother's atmosphere.\n\nThe house had a dignified portico, and always before he had got down\nto the pavement the door opened agreeably and a second respectful\nmanservant stood ready. Then came the large hall, with its noiseless\ncarpets and great Chinese jars, its lacquered cabinets and the wide\nstaircase, and floating down the wide staircase, impatient to greet him,\nlight and shining as a flower petal, sweet and welcoming, radiating a\njoyfulness as cool and clear as a dewy morning, came his mother. \"WELL,\nlittle man, my son,\" she would cry in her happy singing voice, \"WELL?\"\n\nSo he thought she must always be, but indeed these meetings meant very\nmuch to her, she dressed for them and staged them, she perceived the\nbright advantages of her rarity and she was quite determined to have\nher son when the time came to possess him. She kissed him but not\noppressively, she caressed him cleverly; it was only on these rare\noccasions that he was ever kissed or caressed, and she talked to his shy\nboyishness until it felt a more spirited variety of manhood. \"What have\nyou been doing?\" she asked, \"since I saw you last.\"\n\nShe never said he had grown, but she told him he looked tall; and though\nthe tea was a marvellous display it was never an obtrusive tea, it\nwasn't poked at a fellow; a various plenty flowed well within reach of\none's arm, like an agreeable accompaniment to their conversation.\n\n\"What have you done? All sorts of brave things? Do you swim now? I can\nswim. Oh! I can swim half a mile. Some day we will swim races together.\nWhy not? And you ride?...\n\n\"The horse bolted--and you stuck on? Did you squeak? I stick on, but I\nHAVE to squeak. But you--of course, No! you mustn't. I'm just a little\nwoman. And I ride big horses....\"\n\nAnd for the end she had invented a characteristic little ceremony.\n\nShe would stand up in front of him and put her hands on his shoulders\nand look into his face.\n\n\"Clean eyes?\" she would say, \"--still?\"\n\nThen she would take his ears in her little firm hands and kiss very\nmethodically his eyes and his forehead and his cheeks and at last his\nlips. Her own eyes would suddenly brim bright with tears.\n\n\"GO,\" she would say.\n\nThat was the end.\n\nIt seemed to Benham as though he was being let down out of a sunlit\nfairyland to this grey world again.\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nThe contrast between Lady Marayne's pretty amenities and the good\nwoman at Seagate who urged herself almost hourly to forget that William\nPorphyry was not her own son, was entirely unfair. The second Mrs.\nBenham's conscientious spirit and a certain handsome ability about her\nfitted her far more than her predecessor for the onerous duties of a\nschoolmaster's wife, but whatever natural buoyancy she possessed was\noutweighed by an irrepressible conviction derived from an episcopal\ngrandparent that the remarriage of divorced persons is sinful, and by a\nsecret but well-founded doubt whether her husband loved her with a truly\nromantic passion. She might perhaps have borne either of these troubles\nsingly, but the two crushed her spirit.\n\nHer temperament was not one that goes out to meet happiness. She had\nreluctant affections and suspected rather than welcomed the facility\nof other people's. Her susceptibility to disagreeable impressions was\nhowever very ample, and life was fenced about with protections for her\n\"feelings.\" It filled young Benham with inexpressible indignations that\nhis sweet own mother, so gay, so brightly cheerful that even her tears\nwere stars, was never to be mentioned in his stepmother's presence, and\nit was not until he had fully come to years of reflection that he began\nto realize with what honesty, kindness and patience this naturally not\nvery happy lady had nursed, protected, mended for and generally mothered\nhim.\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nAs Benham grew to look manly and bear himself with pride, his mother's\naffection for him blossomed into a passion. She made him come down to\nLondon from Cambridge as often as she could; she went about with him;\nshe made him squire her to theatres and take her out to dinners and\nsup with her at the Carlton, and in the summer she had him with her at\nChexington Manor, the Hertfordshire house Sir Godfrey had given her.\nAnd always when they parted she looked into his eyes to see if they were\nstill clean--whatever she meant by that--and she kissed his forehead and\ncheeks and eyes and lips. She began to make schemes for his career, she\ncontrived introductions she judged would be useful to him later.\n\nEverybody found the relationship charming. Some of the more\nconscientious people, it is true, pretended to think that the Reverend\nHarold Benham was a first husband and long since dead, but that was all.\nAs a matter of fact, in his increasingly futile way he wasn't, either at\nSeagate or in the Educational Supplement of the TIMES. But even the\nmost conscientious of us are not obliged to go to Seagate or read the\nEducational Supplement of the TIMES.\n\nLady Marayne's plans for her son's future varied very pleasantly. She\nwas an industrious reader of biographies, and more particularly of the\nlarge fair biographies of the recently contemporary; they mentioned\npeople she knew, they recalled scenes, each sowed its imaginative crop\nupon her mind, a crop that flourished and flowered until a newer growth\ncame to oust it. She saw her son a diplomat, a prancing pro-consul, an\nempire builder, a trusted friend of the august, the bold leader of new\nmovements, the saviour of ancient institutions, the youngest, brightest,\nmodernest of prime ministers--or a tremendously popular poet. As a rule\nshe saw him unmarried--with a wonderful little mother at his elbow.\nSometimes in romantic flashes he was adored by German princesses\nor eloped with Russian grand-duchesses! But such fancies were HORS\nD'OEUVRE. The modern biography deals with the career. Every project was\nbright, every project had GO--tremendous go. And they all demanded a\nhero, debonnaire and balanced. And Benham, as she began to perceive,\nwasn't balanced. Something of his father had crept into him, a touch\nof moral stiffness. She knew the flavour of that so well. It was a\nstumbling, an elaboration, a spoil-sport and weakness. She tried not to\nadmit to herself that even in the faintest degree it was there. But it\nwas there.\n\n\"Tell me all that you are doing NOW,\" she said to him one afternoon when\nshe had got him to herself during his first visit to Chexington Manor.\n\"How do you like Cambridge? Are you making friends? Have you joined that\nthing--the Union, is it?--and delivered your maiden speech? If you're\nfor politics, Poff, that's your game. Have you begun it?\"\n\nShe lay among splashes of sunshine on the red cushions in the punt,\na little curled-up figure of white, with her sweet pale animated face\nwarmed by the reflection of her red sunshade, and her eyes like little\nfriendly heavens. And he, lean, and unconsciously graceful, sat at her\nfeet and admired her beyond measure, and rejoiced that now at last\nthey were going to be ever so much together, and doubted if it would be\npossible ever to love any other woman so much as he did her.\n\nHe tried to tell her of Cambridge and his friends and the undergraduate\nlife he was leading, but he found it difficult. All sorts of things that\nseemed right and good at Trinity seemed out of drawing in the\npeculiar atmosphere she created about her. All sorts of clumsiness and\nyouthfulness in himself and his associates he felt she wouldn't accept,\ncouldn't accept, that it would be wrong of her to accept. Before\nthey could come before her they must wear a bravery. He couldn't, for\ninstance, tell her how Billy Prothero, renouncing vanity and all social\npretension, had worn a straw hat into November and the last stages of\ndecay, and how it had been burnt by a special commission ceremonially in\nthe great court. He couldn't convey to her the long sessions of beer\nand tobacco and high thinking that went on in Prothero's rooms into\nthe small hours. A certain Gothic greyness and flatness and muddiness\nthrough which the Cambridge spirit struggles to its destiny, he\nconcealed from her. What remained to tell was--attenuated. He could\nnot romance. So she tried to fill in his jejune outlines. She tried to\ninspire a son who seemed most unaccountably up to nothing.\n\n\"You must make good friends,\" she said. \"Isn't young Lord Breeze at\nyour college? His mother the other day told me he was. And Sir Freddy\nQuenton's boy. And there are both the young Baptons at Cambridge.\"\n\nHe knew one of the Baptons.\n\n\"Poff,\" she said suddenly, \"has it ever occurred to you what you are\ngoing to do afterwards. Do you know you are going to be quite well off?\"\n\nBenham looked up with a faint embarrassment. \"My father said something.\nHe was rather vague. It wasn't his affair--that kind of thing.\"\n\n\"You will be quite well off,\" she repeated, without any complicating\nparticulars. \"You will be so well off that it will be possible for you\nto do anything almost that you like in the world. Nothing will tie you.\nNothing....\"\n\n\"But--HOW well off?\"\n\n\"You will have several thousands a year.\"\n\n\"Thousands?\"\n\n\"Yes. Why not?\"\n\n\"But--Mother, this is rather astounding.... Does this mean there are\nestates somewhere, responsibilities?\"\n\n\"It is just money. Investments.\"\n\n\"You know, I've imagined--. I've thought always I should have to DO\nsomething.\"\n\n\"You MUST do something, Poff. But it needn't be for a living. The world\nis yours without that. And so you see you've got to make plans. You've\ngot to know the sort of people who'll have things in their hands. You've\ngot to keep out of--holes and corners. You've got to think of Parliament\nand abroad. There's the army, there's diplomacy. There's the Empire. You\ncan be a Cecil Rhodes if you like. You can be a Winston....\"\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nPerhaps it was only the innate eagerness of Lady Marayne which made\nher feel disappointed in her son's outlook upon life. He did not choose\namong his glittering possibilities, he did not say what he was going to\nbe, proconsul, ambassador, statesman, for days. And he talked VAGUELY of\nwanting to do something fine, but all in a fog. A boy of nearly nineteen\nought to have at least the beginnings of SAVOIR FAIRE.\n\nWas he in the right set? Was he indeed in the right college? Trinity,\nby his account, seemed a huge featureless place--and might he not\nconceivably be LOST in it? In those big crowds one had to insist upon\noneself. Poff never insisted upon himself--except quite at the wrong\nmoment. And there was this Billy Prothero. BILLY! Like a goat or\nsomething. People called William don't get their Christian name insisted\nupon unless they are vulnerable somewhere. Any form of William stamps\na weakness, Willie, Willy, Will, Billy, Bill; it's a fearful handle for\none's friends. At any rate Poff had escaped that. But this Prothero!\n\n\"But who IS this Billy Prothero?\" she asked one evening in the walled\ngarden.\n\n\"He was at Minchinghampton.\"\n\n\"But who IS he? Who is his father? Where does he come from?\"\n\nBenham sought in his mind for a space. \"I don't know,\" he said at last.\nBilly had always been rather reticent about his people. She demanded\ndescriptions. She demanded an account of Billy's furniture, Billy's\nclothes, Billy's form of exercise. It dawned upon Benham that for some\ninexplicable reason she was hostile to Billy. It was like the unmasking\nof an ambuscade. He had talked a lot about Prothero's ideas and the\ndiscussions of social reform and social service that went on in his\nrooms, for Billy read at unknown times, and was open at all hours to any\nargumentative caller. To Lady Marayne all ideas were obnoxious, a form\nof fogging; all ideas, she held, were queer ideas. \"And does he call\nhimself a Socialist?\" she asked. \"I THOUGHT he would.\"\n\n\"Poff,\" she cried suddenly, \"you're not a SOCIALIST?\"\n\n\"Such a vague term.\"\n\n\"But these friends of yours--they seem to be ALL Socialists. Red ties\nand everything complete.\"\n\n\"They have ideas,\" he evaded. He tried to express it better. \"They give\none something to take hold of.\"\n\nShe sat up stiffly on the garden-seat. She lifted her finger at him,\nvery seriously. \"I hope,\" she said with all her heart, \"that you will\nhave nothing to do with such ideas. Nothing. SOCIALISM!\"\n\n\"They make a case.\"\n\n\"Pooh! Any one can make a case.\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"There's no sense in them. What is the good of talking about upsetting\neverything? Just disorder. How can one do anything then? You mustn't.\nYou mustn't. No. It's nonsense, little Poff. It's absurd. And you may\nspoil so much.... I HATE the way you talk of it.... As if it wasn't\nall--absolutely--RUBBISH....\"\n\nShe was earnest almost to the intonation of tears.\n\nWhy couldn't her son go straight for his ends, clear tangible ends,\nas she had always done? This thinking about everything! She had never\nthought about anything in all her life for more than half an hour--and\nit had always turned out remarkably well.\n\nBenham felt baffled. There was a pause. How on earth could he go on\ntelling her his ideas if this was how they were to be taken?\n\n\"I wish sometimes,\" his mother said abruptly, with an unusually sharp\nnote in her voice, \"that you wouldn't look quite so like your father.\"\n\n\"But I'm NOT like my father!\" said Benham puzzled.\n\n\"No,\" she insisted, and with an air of appealing to his soberer reason,\n\"so why should you go LOOKING like him? That CONCERNED expression....\"\n\nShe jumped to her feet. \"Poff,\" she said, \"I want to go and see the\nevening primroses pop. You and I are talking nonsense. THEY don't have\nideas anyhow. They just pop--as God meant them to do. What stupid things\nwe human beings are!\"\n\nHer philosophical moments were perhaps the most baffling of all.\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nBilly Prothero became the symbol in the mind of Lady Marayne for all\nthat disappointed her in Benham. He had to become the symbol, because\nshe could not think of complicated or abstract things, she had to make\nthings personal, and he was the only personality available. She fretted\nover his existence for some days therefore (once she awakened and\nthought about him in the night), and then suddenly she determined to\ngrasp her nettle. She decided to seize and obliterate this Prothero.\nHe must come to Chexington and be thoroughly and conclusively led on,\nexamined, ransacked, shown up, and disposed of for ever. At once. She\nwas not quite clear how she meant to do this, but she was quite resolved\nthat it had to be done. Anything is better than inaction.\n\nThere was a little difficulty about dates and engagements, but he came,\nand through the season of expectation Benham, who was now for the first\ntime in contact with the feminine nature, was delighted at the apparent\nchange to cordiality. So that he talked of Billy to his mother much more\nthan he had ever done before.\n\nBilly had been his particular friend at Minchinghampton, at least\nduring the closing two years of his school life. Billy had fallen into\nfriendship with Benham, as some of us fall in love, quite suddenly, when\nhe saw Benham get down from the fence and be sick after his encounter\nwith the bull. Already Billy was excited by admiration, but it was the\nincongruity of the sickness conquered him. He went back to the school\nwith his hands more than usually in his pockets, and no eyes for\nanything but this remarkable strung-up fellow-creature. He felt he had\nnever observed Benham before, and he was astonished that he had not done\nso.\n\nBilly Prothero was a sturdy sort of boy, generously wanting in good\nlooks. His hair was rough, and his complexion muddy, and he walked\nabout with his hands in his pockets, long flexible lips protruded in\na whistle, and a rather shapeless nose well up to show he didn't care.\nProvidence had sought to console him by giving him a keen eye for the\nabsurdity of other people. He had a suggestive tongue, and he professed\nand practised cowardice to the scandal of all his acquaintances. He was\nsaid never to wash behind his ears, but this report wronged him. There\nhad been a time when he did not do so, but his mother had won him to a\npromise, and now that operation was often the sum of his simple hasty\ntoilet. His desire to associate himself with Benham was so strong\nthat it triumphed over a defensive reserve. It enabled him to detect\naccessible moments, do inobtrusive friendly services, and above all\namuse his quarry. He not only amused Benham, he stimulated him. They\ncame to do quite a number of things together. In the language of\nschoolboy stories they became \"inseparables.\"\n\nProthero's first desire, so soon as they were on a footing that enabled\nhim to formulate desires, was to know exactly what Benham thought he was\nup to in crossing a field with a bull in it instead of going round, and\nby the time he began to understand that, he had conceived an affection\nfor him that was to last a lifetime.\n\n\"I wasn't going to be bullied by a beast,\" said Benham.\n\n\"Suppose it had been an elephant?\" Prothero cried.... \"A mad\nelephant?... A pack of wolves?\"\n\nBenham was too honest not to see that he was entangled. \"Well,\nsuppose in YOUR case it had been a wild cat?... A fierce mastiff?... A\nmastiff?... A terrier?... A lap dog?\"\n\n\"Yes, but my case is that there are limits.\"\n\nBenham was impatient at the idea of limits. With a faintly malicious\npleasure Prothero lugged him back to that idea.\n\n\"We both admit there are limits,\" Prothero concluded. \"But between the\nabsolutely impossible and the altogether possible there's the region\nof risk. You think a man ought to take that risk--\" He reflected. \"I\nthink--no--I think NOT.\"\n\n\"If he feels afraid,\" cried Benham, seeing his one point. \"If he feels\nafraid. Then he ought to take it....\"\n\nAfter a digestive interval, Prothero asked, \"WHY? Why should he?\"\n\nThe discussion of that momentous question, that Why? which Benham\nperhaps might never have dared ask himself, and which Prothero perhaps\nmight never have attempted to answer if it had not been for the clash of\ntheir minds, was the chief topic of their conversation for many months.\nFrom Why be brave? it spread readily enough to Why be honest? Why be\nclean?--all the great whys of life.... Because one believes.... But why\nbelieve it? Left to himself Benham would have felt the mere asking of\nthis question was a thing ignoble, not to be tolerated. It was, as it\nwere, treason to nobility. But Prothero put it one afternoon in a way\nthat permitted no high dismissal of their doubts. \"You can't build your\nhonour on fudge, Benham. Like committing sacrilege--in order to buy a\ncloth for the altar.\"\n\nBy that Benham was slipped from the recognized code and launched upon\nspeculations which became the magnificent research.\n\nIt was not only in complexion and stature and ways of thinking that\nBilly and Benham contrasted. Benham inclined a little to eloquence, he\nliked very clean hands, he had a dread of ridiculous outlines. Prothero\nlapsed readily into ostentatious slovenliness, when his hands were dirty\nhe pitied them sooner than scrubbed them, he would have worn an overcoat\nwith one tail torn off rather than have gone cold. Moreover, Prothero\nhad an earthy liking for animals, he could stroke and tickle strange\ncats until they wanted to leave father and mother and all earthly\npossessions and follow after him, and he mortgaged a term's pocket money\nand bought and kept a small terrier in the school house against all law\nand tradition, under the baseless pretence that it was a stray animal\nof unknown origin. Benham, on the other hand, was shy with small animals\nand faintly hostile to big ones. Beasts he thought were just beasts.\nAnd Prothero had a gift for caricature, while Benham's aptitude was for\nmusic.\n\nIt was Prothero's eyes and pencil that first directed Benham to the\npoor indolences and evasions and insincerities of the masters. It was\nProthero's wicked pictures that made him see the shrivelled absurdity\nof the vulgar theology. But it was Benham who stood between Prothero\nand that rather coarsely conceived epicureanism that seemed his logical\ndestiny. When quite early in their Cambridge days Prothero's\nrevolt against foppery reached a nadir of personal neglect, and two\nphilanthropists from the rooms below him, goaded beyond the normal\ntolerance of Trinity, and assisted by two sportsmen from Trinity Hall,\nburnt his misshapen straw hat (after partly filling it with gunpowder\nand iron filings) and sought to duck him in the fountain in the court,\nit was Benham, in a state between distress and madness, and armed with\na horn-handled cane of exceptional size, who intervened, turned the\nbusiness into a blend of wrangle and scuffle, introduced the degrading\ntopic of duelling into a simple wholesome rag of four against one,\ncarried him off under the cloud of horror created by this impropriety\nand so saved him, still only slightly wetted, not only from this\nindignity but from the experiment in rationalism that had provoked it.\n\nBecause Benham made it perfectly clear what he had thought and felt\nabout this hat.\n\nSuch was the illuminating young man whom Lady Marayne decided to invite\nto Chexington, into the neighbourhood of herself, Sir Godfrey, and her\ncircle of friends.\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nHe was quite anxious to satisfy the requirements of Benham's people and\nto do his friend credit. He was still in the phase of being a penitent\npig, and he inquired carefully into the needs and duties of a summer\nguest in a country house. He knew it was quite a considerable country\nhouse, and that Sir Godfrey wasn't Benham's father, but like most\npeople, he was persuaded that Lady Marayne had divorced the parental\nBenham. He arrived dressed very neatly in a brown suit that had only one\nfault, it had not the remotest suggestion of having been made for him.\nIt fitted his body fairly well, it did annex his body with only a few\nslight incompatibilities, but it repudiated his hands and face. He had\na conspicuously old Gladstone bag and a conspicuously new despatch case,\nand he had forgotten black ties and dress socks and a hair brush. He\narrived in the late afternoon, was met by Benham, in tennis flannels,\nlooking smartened up and a little unfamiliar, and taken off in a\nspirited dog-cart driven by a typical groom. He met his host and hostess\nat dinner.\n\nSir Godfrey was a rationalist and a residuum. Very much of him, too much\nperhaps, had gone into the acquirement and perfect performance of the\ncaecal operation; the man one met in the social world was what was\nleft over. It had the effect of being quiet, but in its unobtrusive way\nknobby. He had a knobby brow, with an air about it of having recently\nbeen intent, and his conversation was curiously spotted with little\nknobby arrested anecdotes. If any one of any distinction was named, he\nwould reflect and say, \"Of course,--ah, yes, I know him, I know him.\nYes, I did him a little service--in '96.\"\n\nAnd something in his manner would suggest a satisfaction, or a\ndissatisfaction with confidential mysteries.\n\nHe welcomed Billy Prothero in a colourless manner, and made conversation\nabout Cambridge. He had known one or two of the higher dons. One he had\ndone at Cambridge quite recently. \"The inns are better than they are at\nOxford, which is not saying very much, but the place struck me as being\nchanged. The men seemed younger....\"\n\nThe burden of the conversation fell upon Lady Marayne. She looked\nextraordinarily like a flower to Billy, a little diamond buckle on a\nblack velvet band glittered between the two masses of butter-coloured\nhair that flowed back from her forehead, her head was poised on the\nprettiest neck conceivable, and her shapely little shoulders and her\nshapely little arms came decidedly but pleasantly out of a softness and\nsparkle of white and silver and old rose. She talked what sounded like\ninnocent commonplaces a little spiced by whim, though indeed each remark\nhad an exploratory quality, and her soft blue eyes rested ever and again\nupon Billy's white tie. It seemed she did so by the merest inadvertency,\nbut it made the young man wish he had after all borrowed a black one\nfrom Benham. But the manservant who had put his things out had put it\nout, and he hadn't been quite sure. Also she noted all the little things\nhe did with fork and spoon and glass. She gave him an unusual sense of\nbeing brightly, accurately and completely visible.\n\nChexington, it seemed to Billy, was done with a large and costly and\neasy completeness. The table with its silver and flowers was much more\nbeautifully done than any table he had sat at before, and in the dimness\nbeyond the brightness there were two men to wait on the four of them.\nThe old grey butler was really wonderfully good....\n\n\"You shoot, Mr. Prothero?\"\n\n\"You hunt, Mr. Prothero?\"\n\n\"You know Scotland well, Mr. Prothero?\"\n\nThese questions disturbed Prothero. He did not shoot, he did not hunt,\nhe did not go to Scotland for the grouse, he did not belong, and Lady\nMarayne ought to have seen that he did not belong to the class that does\nthese things.\n\n\"You ride much, Mr. Prothero?\"\n\nBilly conceived a suspicion that these innocent inquiries were designed\nto emphasize a contrast in his social quality. But he could not be sure.\nOne never could be sure with Lady Marayne. It might be just that she\ndid not understand the sort of man he was. And in that case ought he\nto maintain the smooth social surface unbroken by pretending as far as\npossible to be this kind of person, or ought he to make a sudden gap in\nit by telling his realities. He evaded the shooting question anyhow. He\nleft it open for Lady Marayne and the venerable butler and Sir Godfrey\nand every one to suppose he just happened to be the sort of gentleman\nof leisure who doesn't shoot. He disavowed hunting, he made it appear he\ntravelled when he travelled in directions other than Scotland. But the\nfourth question brought him to bay. He regarded his questioner with his\nsmall rufous eye.\n\n\"I have never been across a horse in my life, Lady Marayne.\"\n\n\"Tut, tut,\" said Sir Godfrey. \"Why!--it's the best of exercise.\nEvery man ought to ride. Good for the health. Keeps him fit. Prevents\nlodgments. Most trouble due to lodgments.\"\n\n\"I've never had a chance of riding. And I think I'm afraid of horses.\"\n\n\"That's only an excuse,\" said Lady Marayne. \"Everybody's afraid of\nhorses and nobody's really afraid of horses.\"\n\n\"But I'm not used to horses. You see--I live on my mother. And she can't\nafford to keep a stable.\"\n\nHis hostess did not see his expression of discomfort. Her pretty eyes\nwere intent upon the peas with which she was being served.\n\n\"Does your mother live in the country?\" she asked, and took her peas\nwith fastidious exactness.\n\nProthero coloured brightly. \"She lives in London.\"\n\n\"All the year?\"\n\n\"All the year.\"\n\n\"But isn't it dreadfully hot in town in the summer?\"\n\nProthero had an uncomfortable sense of being very red in the face. This\nkept him red. \"We're suburban people,\" he said.\n\n\"But I thought--isn't there the seaside?\"\n\n\"My mother has a business,\" said Prothero, redder than ever.\n\n\"O-oh!\" said Lady Marayne. \"What fun that must be for her?\"\n\n\"It's a real business, and she has to live by it. Sometimes it's a\nworry.\"\n\n\"But a business of her own!\" She surveyed the confusion of his visage\nwith a sweet intelligence. \"Is it an amusing sort of business, Mr.\nProthero?\"\n\nProthero looked mulish. \"My mother is a dressmaker,\" he said. \"In\nBrixton. She doesn't do particularly badly--or well. I live on my\nscholarship. I have lived on scholarships since I was thirteen. And you\nsee, Lady Marayne, Brixton is a poor hunting country.\"\n\nLady Marayne felt she had unmasked Prothero almost indecently. Whatever\nhappened there must be no pause. There must be no sign of a hitch.\n\n\"But it's good at tennis,\" she said. \"You DO play tennis, Mr. Prothero?\"\n\n\"I--I gesticulate,\" said Prothero.\n\nLady Marayne, still in flight from that pause, went off at a tangent.\n\n\"Poff, my dear,\" she said, \"I've had a diving-board put at the deep end\nof the pond.\"\n\nThe remark hung unanswered for a moment. The transition had been too\nquick for Benham's state of mind.\n\n\"Do you swim, Mr. Prothero?\" the lady asked, though a moment before she\nhad determined that she would never ask him a question again. But this\ntime it was a lucky question.\n\n\"Prothero mopped up the lot of us at Minchinghampton with his diving and\nswimming,\" Benham explained, and the tension was relaxed.\n\nLady Marayne spoke of her own swimming, and became daring and amusing at\nher difficulties with local feeling when first she swam in the pond.\nThe high road ran along the far side of the pond--\"And it didn't wear a\nhedge or anything,\" said Lady Marayne. \"That was what they didn't quite\nlike. Swimming in an undraped pond....\"\n\nProthero had been examined enough. Now he must be entertained. She told\nstories about the village people in her brightest manner. The third\nstory she regretted as soon as she was fairly launched upon it; it\nwas how she had interviewed the village dressmaker, when Sir Godfrey\ninsisted upon her supporting local industries. It was very amusing but\ntechnical. The devil had put it into her head. She had to go through\nwith it. She infused an extreme innocence into her eyes and fixed them\non Prothero, although she felt a certain deepening pinkness in her\ncheeks was betraying her, and she did not look at Benham until her\nunhappy, but otherwise quite amusing anecdote, was dead and gone and\nsafely buried under another....\n\nBut people ought not to go about having dressmakers for mothers....\n\nAnd coming into other people's houses and influencing their sons....\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nThat night when everything was over Billy sat at the writing-table of\nhis sumptuous bedroom--the bed was gilt wood, the curtains of the three\ngreat windows were tremendous, and there was a cheval glass that showed\nthe full length of him and seemed to look over his head for more,--and\nmeditated upon this visit of his. It was more than he had been prepared\nfor. It was going to be a great strain. The sleek young manservant in\nan alpaca jacket, who said \"Sir\" whenever you looked at him, and who had\nseized upon and unpacked Billy's most private Gladstone bag without even\nasking if he might do so, and put away and displayed Billy's things in\na way that struck Billy as faintly ironical, was unexpected. And it was\nunexpected that the brown suit, with its pockets stuffed with Billy's\npersonal and confidential sundries, had vanished. And apparently a\nbath in a bathroom far down the corridor was prescribed for him in\nthe morning; he hadn't thought of a dressing-gown. And after one had\ndressed, what did one do? Did one go down and wander about the house\nlooking for the breakfast-room or wait for a gong? Would Sir Godfrey\nread Family Prayers? And afterwards did one go out or hang about to be\nentertained? He knew now quite clearly that those wicked blue eyes would\nmark his every slip. She did not like him. She did not like him, he\nsupposed, because he was common stuff. He didn't play up to her world\nand her. He was a discord in this rich, cleverly elaborate household.\nYou could see it in the servants' attitudes. And he was committed to a\nweek of this.\n\nBilly puffed out his cheeks to blow a sigh, and then decided to be angry\nand say \"Damn!\"\n\nThis way of living which made him uncomfortable was clearly an\nirrational and objectionable way of living. It was, in a cumbersome way,\nluxurious. But the waste of life of it, the servants, the observances,\nall concentrated on the mere detail of existence? There came a rap at\nthe door. Benham appeared, wearing an expensive-looking dressing-jacket\nwhich Lady Marayne had bought for him. He asked if he might talk for\na bit and smoke. He sat down in a capacious chintz-covered easy chair\nbeside Prothero, lit a cigarette, and came to the point after only a\ntrivial hesitation.\n\n\"Prothero,\" he said, \"you know what my father is.\"\n\n\"I thought he ran a preparatory school.\"\n\nThere was the profoundest resentment in Prothero's voice.\n\n\"And, all the same, I'm going to be a rich man.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said Prothero, without any shadow of\ncongratulation.\n\nBenham told Prothero as much as his mother had conveyed to him of the\nresources of his wealth. Her version had been adapted to his tender\nyears and the delicacies of her position. The departed Nolan had become\nan eccentric godfather. Benham's manner was apologetic, and he made\nit clear that only recently had these facts come to him. He had never\nsuspected that he had had this eccentric godfather. It altered the\noutlook tremendously. It was one of the reasons that made Benham glad to\nhave Prothero there, one wanted a man of one's own age, who understood\nthings a little, to try over one's new ideas. Prothero listened with an\nunamiable expression.\n\n\"What would you do, Prothero, if you found yourself saddled with some\nthousands a year?\"\n\n\"Godfathers don't grow in Brixton,\" said Prothero concisely.\n\n\"Well, what am I to do, Prothero?\"\n\n\"Does all THIS belong to you?\"\n\n\"No, this is my mother's.\"\n\n\"Godfather too?\"\n\n\"I've not thought.... I suppose so. Or her own.\"\n\nProthero meditated.\n\n\"THIS life,\" he said at last, \"this large expensiveness--...\"\n\nHe left his criticism unfinished.\n\n\"I agree. It suits my mother somehow. I can't understand her living in\nany other way. But--for me....\"\n\n\"What can one do with several thousands a year?\"\n\nProthero's interest in this question presently swamped his petty\npersonal resentments. \"I suppose,\" he said, \"one might have rather a\nlark with money like that. One would be free to go anywhere. To set all\nsorts of things going.... It's clear you can't sell all you have and\ngive it to the poor. That is pauperization nowadays. You might run\na tremendously revolutionary paper. A real upsetting paper. How many\nthousands is it?\"\n\n\"I don't know. SOME.\"\n\nProthero's interest was growing as he faced the possibilities.\n\n\"I've dreamt of a paper,\" he said, \"a paper that should tell the brute\ntruth about things.\"\n\n\"I don't know that I'm particularly built to be a journalist,\" Benham\nobjected.\n\n\"You're not,\" said Billy.... \"You might go into Parliament as a\nperfectly independent member.... Only you wouldn't get in....\"\n\n\"I'm not a speaker,\" said Benham.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Billy, \"if you don't decide on a game, you'll just go\non like this. You'll fall into a groove, you'll--you'll hunt. You'll go\nto Scotland for the grouse.\"\n\nFor the moment Prothero had no further suggestions.\n\nBenham waited for a second or so before he broached his own idea.\n\n\"Why, first of all, at any rate, Billy, shouldn't one use one's money\nto make the best of oneself? To learn things that men without money and\nleisure find it difficult to learn? By an accident, however unjust it\nis, one is in the position of a leader and a privileged person. Why not\ndo one's best to give value as that?\"\n\n\"Benham, that's the thin end of aristocracy!\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I hate aristocracy. For you it means doing what you like. While you are\nenergetic you will kick about and then you will come back to this.\"\n\n\"That's one's own look-out,\" said Benham, after reflection.\n\n\"No, it's bound to happen.\"\n\nBenham retreated a little from the immediate question.\n\n\"Well, we can't suddenly at a blow change the world. If it isn't to be\nplutocracy to-day it has to be aristocracy.\"\n\nProthero frowned over this, and then he made a sweeping proposition.\n\n\"YOU CANNOT HAVE ARISTOCRACY,\" he said, \"BECAUSE, YOU SEE--ALL MEN ARE\nRIDICULOUS. Democracy has to fight its way out from under plutocracy.\nThere is nothing else to be done.\"\n\n\"But a man in my position--?\"\n\n\"It's a ridiculous position. You may try to escape being ridiculous. You\nwon't succeed.\"\n\nIt seemed to Benham for a moment as though Prothero had got to the\nbottom of the question, and then he perceived that he had only got to\nthe bottom of himself. Benham was pacing the floor.\n\nHe turned at the open window, held out a long forefinger, and uttered\nhis countervailing faith.\n\n\"Even if he is ridiculous, Prothero, a man may still be an aristocrat. A\nman may anyhow be as much of an aristocrat as he can be.\"\n\nProthero reflected. \"No,\" he said, \"it sounds all right, but it's wrong.\nI hate all these advantages and differences and distinctions. A man's a\nman. What you say sounds well, but it's the beginning of pretension, of\npride--\"\n\nHe stopped short.\n\n\"Better, pride than dishonour,\" said Benham, \"better the pretentious\nlife than the sordid life. What else is there?\"\n\n\"A life isn't necessarily sordid because it isn't pretentious,\" said\nProthero, his voice betraying a defensive disposition.\n\n\"But a life with a large income MUST be sordid unless it makes some sort\nof attempt to be fine....\"\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nBy transitions that were as natural as they were complicated and\nuntraceable Prothero found his visit to Chexington developing into a\ntangle of discussions that all ultimately resolved themselves into an\nantagonism of the democratic and the aristocratic idea. And his part\nwas, he found, to be the exponent of the democratic idea. The next day\nhe came down early, his talk with Benham still running through his head,\nand after a turn or so in the garden he was attracted to the front door\nby a sound of voices, and found Lady Marayne had been up still earlier\nand was dismounting from a large effective black horse. This extorted an\nunwilling admiration from him. She greeted him very pleasantly and made\na kind of introduction of her steed. There had been trouble at a gate,\nhe was a young horse and fidgeted at gates; the dispute was still bright\nin her. Benham she declared was still in bed. \"Wait till I have a mount\nfor him.\" She reappeared fitfully in the breakfast-room, and then he was\nleft to Benham until just before lunch. They read and afterwards, as the\nsummer day grew hot, they swam in the nude pond. She joined them in the\nwater, splashing about in a costume of some elaboration and being very\ncareful not to wet her hair. Then she came and sat with them on the\nseat under the big cedar and talked with them in a wrap that was pretty\nrather than prudish and entirely unmotherly. And she began a fresh\nattack upon him by asking him if he wasn't a Socialist and whether he\ndidn't want to pull down Chexington and grow potatoes all over the park.\n\nThis struck Prothero as an inadequate statement of the Socialist project\nand he made an unsuccessful attempt to get it amended.\n\nThe engagement thus opened was renewed with great energy at lunch.\nSir Godfrey had returned to London and the inmost aspect of his\nfellow-creatures, but the party of three was supplemented by a vague\nyoung lady from the village and an alert agent from the neighbouring\nTentington estate who had intentions about a cottage. Lady Marayne\ninsisted upon regarding Socialism as a proposal to reinaugurate the\nfirst French Revolution, as an inversion of society so that it would be\nbottom upward, as an attack upon rule, order, direction. \"And what good\nare all these proposals? If you had the poor dear king beheaded,\nyou'd only get a Napoleon. If you divided all the property up between\neverybody, you'd have rich and poor again in a year.\"\n\nBilly perceived no way of explaining away this version of his Socialism\nthat would not involve uncivil contradictions--and nobody ever\ncontradicted Lady Marayne.\n\n\"But, Lady Marayne, don't you think there is a lot of disorder and\ninjustice in the world?\" he protested.\n\n\"There would be ever so much more if your Socialists had their way.\"\n\n\"But still, don't you think--...\"\n\nIt is unnecessary even to recapitulate these universal controversies of\nour time. The lunch-table and the dinner-table and the general talk of\nthe house drifted more and more definitely at its own level in the\nsame direction as the private talk of Prothero and Benham, towards\nthe antagonism of the privileged few and the many, of the trained\nand traditioned against the natural and undisciplined, of aristocracy\nagainst democracy. At the week-end Sir Godfrey returned to bring fresh\nelements. He said that democracy was unscientific. \"To deny aristocracy\nis to deny the existence of the fittest. It is on the existence of the\nfittest that progress depends.\"\n\n\"But do our social conditions exalt the fittest?\" asked Prothero.\n\n\"That is another question,\" said Benham.\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Sir Godfrey. \"That is another question. But speaking\nwith some special knowledge, I should say that on the whole the people\nwho are on the top of things OUGHT to be on the top of things. I agree\nwith Aristotle that there is such a thing as a natural inferior.\"\n\n\"So far as I can understand Mr. Prothero,\" said Lady Marayne, \"he thinks\nthat all the inferiors are the superiors and all the superiors inferior.\nIt's quite simple....\"\n\nIt made Prothero none the less indignant with this, that there\nwas indeed a grain of truth in it. He hated superiors, he felt for\ninferiors.\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nAt last came the hour of tipping. An embarrassed and miserable Prothero\nwent slinking about the house distributing unexpected gold.\n\nIt was stupid, it was damnable; he had had to borrow the money from his\nmother....\n\nLady Marayne felt he had escaped her. The controversy that should have\nsplit these two young men apart had given them a new interest in each\nother. When afterwards she sounded her son, very delicately, to see\nif indeed he was aware of the clumsiness, the social ignorance and\nuneasiness, the complete unsuitability of his friend, she could get no\nmore from him than that exasperating phrase, \"He has ideas!\"\n\nWhat are ideas? England may yet be ruined by ideas.\n\nHe ought never to have gone to Trinity, that monster packet of\neverything. He ought to have gone to some little GOOD college, good all\nthrough. She ought to have asked some one who KNEW.\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nOne glowing afternoon in October, as these two young men came over\nMagdalen Bridge after a long disputatious and rather tiring walk to\nDrayton--they had been talking of Eugenics and the \"family\"--Benham was\nalmost knocked down by an American trotter driven by Lord Breeze. \"Whup\nthere!\" said Lord Breeze in a voice deliberately brutal, and Benham,\nroused from that abstraction which is partly fatigue, had to jump aside\nand stumbled against the parapet as the gaunt pacer went pounding by.\n\nLord Breeze grinned the sort of grin a man remembers. And passed.\n\n\"Damnation!\" said Benham with a face that had become suddenly very\nwhite.\n\nThen presently. \"Any fool can do that who cares to go to the trouble.\"\n\n\"That,\" said Prothero, taking up their unquenchable issue, \"that is the\nfeeling of democracy.\"\n\n\"I walk because I choose to,\" said Benham.\n\nThe thing rankled.\n\n\"This equestrianism,\" he began, \"is a matter of time and money--time\neven more than money. I want to read. I want to deal with ideas....\n\n\"Any fool can drive....\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" said Prothero.\n\n\"As for riding, it means no more than the elaborate study and\ncultivation of your horse. You have to know him. All horses are\nindividuals. A made horse perhaps goes its round like an omnibus, but\nfor the rest....\"\n\nProthero made a noise of sympathetic assent.\n\n\"In a country where equestrianism is assertion I suppose one must be\nequestrian....\"\n\nThat night some malignant spirit kept Benham awake, and great\nAmerican trotters with vast wide-striding feet and long yellow teeth,\nuncontrollable, hard-mouthed American trotters, pounded over his angry\nsoul.\n\n\"Prothero,\" he said in hall next day, \"we are going to drive to-morrow.\"\n\nNext day, so soon as they had lunched, he led the way towards Maltby's,\nin Crosshampton Lane. Something in his bearing put a question into\nProthero's mind. \"Benham,\" he asked, \"have you ever driven before?\"\n\n\"NEVER,\" said Benham.\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"I'm going to now.\"\n\nSomething between pleasure and alarm came into Prothero's eyes. He\nquickened his pace so as to get alongside his friend and scrutinize his\npale determination. \"Why are you doing this?\" he asked.\n\n\"I want to do it.\"\n\n\"Benham, is it--EQUESTRIAN?\"\n\nBenham made no audible reply. They proceeded resolutely in silence.\n\nAn air of expectation prevailed in Maltby's yard. In the shafts of a\nhigh, bleak-looking vehicle with vast side wheels, a throne-like vehicle\nthat impressed Billy Prothero as being a gig, a very large angular black\nhorse was being harnessed.\n\n\"This is mine,\" said Benham compactly.\n\n\"This is yours, sir,\" said an ostler.\n\n\"He looks--QUIET.\"\n\n\"You'll find him fresh enough, sir.\"\n\nBenham made a complicated ascent to the driver's seat and was handed the\nreins. \"Come on,\" he said, and Prothero followed to a less exalted seat\nat Benham's side. They seemed to be at a very great height indeed. The\nhorse was then led out into Crosshampton Lane, faced towards Trinity\nStreet and discharged. \"Check,\" said Benham, and touched the steed with\nhis whip. They started quite well, and the ostlers went back into the\nyard, visibly unanxious. It struck Prothero that perhaps driving was\nless difficult than he had supposed.\n\nThey went along Crosshampton Lane, that high-walled gulley, with\ndignity, with only a slight suggestion of the inaccuracy that was\npresently to become apparent, until they met a little old bearded don\non a bicycle. Then some misunderstanding arose between Benham and the\nhorse, and the little bearded don was driven into the narrow pavement\nand had to get off hastily. He made no comment, but his face became like\na gargoyle. \"Sorry,\" said Benham, and gave his mind to the corner. There\nwas some difficulty about whether they were to turn to the right or the\nleft, but at last Benham, it seemed, carried his point, and they went\nalong the narrow street, past the grey splendours of King's, and rather\nin the middle of the way.\n\nProthero considered the beast in front of him, and how proud and\ndisrespectful a horse in a dogcart can seem to those behind it!\nMoreover, unaccustomed as he was to horses, he was struck by the strong\nresemblance a bird's-eye view of a horse bears to a fiddle, a fiddle\nwith devil's ears.\n\n\"Of course,\" said Prothero, \"this isn't a trotter.\"\n\n\"I couldn't get a trotter,\" said Benham.\n\n\"I thought I would try this sort of thing before I tried a trotter,\" he\nadded.\n\nAnd then suddenly came disaster.\n\nThere was a butcher's cart on the right, and Benham, mistrusting the\nintelligence of his steed, insisted upon an excessive amplitude of\nclearance. He did not reckon with the hand-barrow on his left, piled\nup with dirty plates from the lunch of Trinity Hall. It had been left\nthere; its custodian was away upon some mysterious errand. Heaven knows\nwhy Trinity Hall exhibited the treasures of its crockery thus stained\nand deified in the Cambridge streets. But it did--for Benham's and\nProthero's undoing. Prothero saw the great wheel over which he was\npoised entangle itself with the little wheel of the barrow. \"God!\"\nhe whispered, and craned, fascinated. The little wheel was manifestly\nintrigued beyond all self-control by the great wheel; it clung to it, it\nwent before it, heedless of the barrow, of which it was an inseparable\npart. The barrow came about with an appearance of unwillingness, it\nlocked against the great wheel; it reared itself towards Prothero and\nbegan, smash, smash, smash, to shed its higher plates. It was clear\nthat Benham was grappling with a crisis upon a basis of inadequate\nexperience. A number of people shouted haphazard things. Then, too late,\nthe barrow had persuaded the little wheel to give up its fancy for the\ngreat wheel, and there was an enormous crash.\n\n\"Whoa!\" cried Benham. \"Whoa!\" but also, unfortunately, he sawed hard at\nthe horse's mouth.\n\nThe animal, being in some perplexity, danced a little in the narrow\nstreet, and then it had come about and it was backing, backing, on\nthe narrow pavement and towards the plate-glass window of a book and\nnewspaper shop. Benham tugged at its mouth much harder than ever.\nProthero saw the window bending under the pressure of the wheel. A sense\nof the profound seriousness of life and of the folly of this expedition\ncame upon him. With extreme nimbleness he got down just as the window\nburst. It went with an explosion like a pistol shot, and then a clatter\nof falling glass. People sprang, it seemed, from nowhere, and jostled\nabout Prothero, so that he became a peripheral figure in the discussion.\nHe perceived that a man in a green apron was holding the horse, and that\nvarious people were engaged in simultaneous conversation with Benham,\nwho with a pale serenity of face and an awful calm of manner, dealt with\neach of them in turn.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he was saying. \"Somebody ought to have been in charge of\nthe barrow. Here are my cards. I am ready to pay for any damage....\n\n\"The barrow ought not to have been there....\n\n\"Yes, I am going on. Of course I'm going on. Thank you.\"\n\nHe beckoned to the man who had held the horse and handed him\nhalf-a-crown. He glanced at Prothero as one might glance at a stranger.\n\"Check!\" he said. The horse went on gravely. Benham lifted out his whip.\nHe appeared to have clean forgotten Prothero. Perhaps presently he would\nmiss him. He went on past Trinity, past the ruddy brick of St. John's.\nThe curve of the street hid him from Prothero's eyes.\n\nProthero started in pursuit. He glimpsed the dog-cart turning into\nBridge Street. He had an impression that Benham used the whip at the\ncorner, and that the dog-cart went forward out of sight with a startled\njerk. Prothero quickened his pace.\n\nBut when he got to the fork between the Huntingdon Road and the\nCottenham Road, both roads were clear.\n\nHe spent some time in hesitation. Then he went along the Huntingdon Road\nuntil he came upon a road-mender, and learnt that Benham had passed that\nway. \"Going pretty fast 'e was,\" said the road-mender, \"and whipping 'is\n'orse. Else you might 'a thought 'e was a boltin' with 'im.\" Prothero\ndecided that if Benham came back at all he would return by way of\nCottenham, and it was on the Cottenham Road that at last he encountered\nhis friend again.\n\nBenham was coming along at that good pace which all experienced horses\nwhen they are fairly turned back towards Cambridge display. And there\nwas something odd about Benham, as though he had a large circular\nhalo with a thick rim. This, it seemed, had replaced his hat. He was\ncertainly hatless. The warm light of the sinking sun shone upon the\nhorse and upon Benham's erect figure and upon his face, and gleams of\nfire kept flashing from his head to this rim, like the gleam of drawn\nswords seen from afar. As he drew nearer this halo detached itself from\nhim and became a wheel sticking up behind him. A large, clumsy-looking\nbicycle was attached to the dog-cart behind. The expression of Benham's\ngolden face was still a stony expression; he regarded his friend with\nhard eyes.\n\n\"You all right, Benham?\" cried Prothero, advancing into the road.\n\nHis eye examined the horse. It looked all right, if anything it was a\ntrifle subdued; there was a little foam about its mouth, but not very\nmuch.\n\n\"Whoa!\" said Benham, and the horse stopped. \"Are you coming up,\nProthero?\"\n\nProthero clambered up beside him. \"I was anxious,\" he said.\n\n\"There was no need to be.\"\n\n\"You've broken your whip.\"\n\n\"Yes. It broke.... GET up!\"\n\nThey proceeded on their way to Cambridge.\n\n\"Something has happened to the wheel,\" said Prothero, trying to be at\nhis ease.\n\n\"Merely a splinter or so. And a spoke perhaps.\"\n\n\"And what is this behind?\"\n\nBenham made a half-turn of the head. \"It's a motor-bicycle.\"\n\nProthero took in details.\n\n\"Some of it is missing.\"\n\n\"No, the front wheel is under the seat.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"Did you find it?\" Prothero asked, after an interval.\n\n\"You mean?\"\n\n\"He ran into a motor-car--as I was passing. I was perhaps a little to\nblame. He asked me to bring his machine to Cambridge. He went on in the\ncar.... It is all perfectly simple.\"\n\nProthero glanced at the splinters in the wheel with a renewed interest.\n\n\"Did your wheel get into it?\" he asked. Benham affected not to hear. He\nwas evidently in no mood for story-telling.\n\n\"Why did you get down, Prothero?\" he asked abruptly, with the note of\nsuppressed anger thickening his voice.\n\nProthero became vividly red. \"I don't know,\" he said, after an interval.\n\n\"I DO,\" said Benham, and they went on in a rich and active silence to\nCambridge, and the bicycle repair shop in Bridge Street, and Trinity\nCollege. At the gate of Trinity Benham stopped, and conveyed rather by\nacts than words that Prothero was to descend. He got down meekly enough,\nalthough he felt that the return to Maltby's yard might have many points\nof interest. But the spirit had gone out of him.\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nFor three days the two friends avoided each other, and then Prothero\nwent to Benham's room. Benham was smoking cigarettes--Lady Marayne, in\nthe first warmth of his filial devotion, had prohibited his pipe--and\nreading Webb's INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY. \"Hello!\" he said coldly, scarcely\nlooking up, and continued to read that absorbing work.\n\n\"I keep on thinking how I jumped down from that damned dog-cart,\" said\nProthero, without any preface.\n\n\"It didn't matter in the least,\" said Benham distantly.\n\n\"Oh! ROT,\" said Prothero. \"I behaved like a coward.\"\n\nBenham shut his book.\n\n\"Benham,\" said Prothero. \"You are right about aristocracy, and I am\nwrong. I've been thinking about it night and day.\"\n\nBenham betrayed no emotion. But his tone changed. \"Billy,\" he said,\n\"there are cigarettes and whiskey in the corner. Don't make a fuss about\na trifle.\"\n\n\"No whiskey,\" said Billy, and lit a cigarette. \"And it isn't a trifle.\"\n\nHe came to Benham's hearthrug. \"That business,\" he said, \"has changed\nall my views. No--don't say something polite! I see that if one hasn't\nthe habit of pride one is bound to get off a dogcart when it seems\nlikely to smash. You have the habit of pride, and I haven't. So far as\nthe habit of pride goes, I come over to the theory of aristocracy.\"\n\nBenham said nothing, but he put down Sidney and Beatrice Webb, and\nreached out for and got and lit a cigarette.\n\n\"I give up 'Go as you please.' I give up the natural man. I admit\ntraining. I perceive I am lax and flabby, unguarded, I funk too much, I\neat too much, and I drink too much. And, yet, what I have always liked\nin you, Benham, is just this--that you don't.\"\n\n\"I do,\" said Benham.\n\n\"Do what?\"\n\n\"Funk.\"\n\n\"Benham, I believe that naturally you funk as much as I do. You're more\na thing of nerves than I am, far more. But you keep yourself up to\nthe mark, and I have let myself get flabby. You're so right. You're\nso utterly right. These last nights I've confessed it--aloud. I had\nan inkling of it--after that rag. But now it's as clear as daylight.\nI don't know if you mean to go on with me, after what's happened, but\nanyhow I want you to know, whether you end our friendship or not--\"\n\n\"Billy, don't be an old ass,\" said Benham.\n\nBoth young men paused for a moment. They made no demonstrations. But the\nstrain was at an end between them.\n\n\"I've thought it all out,\" Billy went on with a sudden buoyancy. \"We\ntwo are both of the same kind of men. Only you see, Benham, you have\na natural pride and I haven't. You have pride. But we are both\nintellectuals. We both belong to what the Russians call the\nIntelligentsia. We have ideas, we have imagination, that is our\nstrength. And that is our weakness. That makes us moral light-weights.\nWe are flimsy and uncertain people. All intellectuals are flimsy and\nuncertain people. It's not only that they are critical and fastidious;\nthey are weak-handed. They look about them; their attention wanders.\nUnless they have got a habit of controlling themselves and forcing\nthemselves and holding themselves together.\"\n\n\"The habit of pride.\"\n\n\"Yes. And then--then we are lords of the world.\"\n\n\"All this, Billy,\" said Benham, \"I steadfastly believe.\"\n\n\"I've seen it all now,\" said Prothero. \"Lord! how clearly I see it!\nThe intellectual is either a prince or he is a Greek slave in a Roman\nhousehold. He's got to hold his chin up or else he becomes--even as\nthese dons we see about us--a thing that talks appointments, a toady, a\nport-wine bibber, a mass of detail, a conscious maker of neat sayings,\na growing belly under a dwindling brain. Their gladness is drink or\ngratified vanity or gratified malice, their sorrow is indigestion\nor--old maid's melancholy. They are the lords of the world who will not\ntake the sceptre.... And what I want to say to you, Benham, more than\nanything else is, YOU go on--YOU make yourself equestrian. You drive\nyour horse against Breeze's, and go through the fire and swim in the\nice-cold water and climb the precipice and drink little and sleep hard.\nAnd--I wish I could do so too.\"\n\n\"But why not?\"\n\n\"Because I can't. Now I admit I've got shame in my heart and pride in\nmy head, and I'm strung up. I might do something--this afternoon. But it\nwon't last. YOU--you have pride in your bones. My pride will vanish at\na laugh. My honour will go at a laugh. I'm just exalted by a crisis.\nThat's all. I'm an animal of intelligence. Soul and pride are weak in\nme. My mouth waters, my cheek brightens, at the sight of good things.\nAnd I've got a lickerish tail, Benham. You don't know. You don't begin\nto imagine. I'm secretive. But I quiver with hot and stirring desires.\nAnd I'm indolent--dirty indolent. Benham, there are days when I splash\nmy bath about without getting into it. There are days when I turn back\nfrom a walk because there's a cow in the field.... But, I spare you the\nviler details.... And it's that makes me hate fine people and try so\nearnestly to persuade myself that any man is as good as any man, if not\na trifle better. Because I know it isn't so....\"\n\n\"Billy,\" said Benham, \"you've the boldest mind that ever I met.\"\n\nProthero's face lit with satisfaction. Then his countenance fell again.\n\"I know I'm better there,\" he said, \"and yet, see how I let in a whole\nsystem of lies to cover my secret humiliations. There, at least, I will\ncling to pride. I will at least THINK free and clean and high. But you\ncan climb higher than I can. You've got the grit to try and LIVE high.\nThere you are, Benham.\"\n\nBenham stuck one leg over the arm of his chair. \"Billy,\" he said, \"come\nand be--equestrian and stop this nonsense.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Damn it--you DIVE!\"\n\n\"You'd go in before me if a woman was drowning.\"\n\n\"Nonsense. I'm going to ride. Come and ride too. You've a cleverer way\nwith animals than I have. Why! that horse I was driving the other day\nwould have gone better alone. I didn't drive it. I just fussed it. I\ninterfered. If I ride for ever, I shall never have decent hands, I shall\nalways hang on my horse's mouth at a gallop, I shall never be sure at a\njump. But at any rate I shall get hard. Come and get hard too.\"\n\n\"You can,\" said Billy, \"you can. But not I! Heavens, the TROUBLE of it!\nThe riding-school! The getting up early! No!--for me the Trumpington\nRoad on foot in the afternoon. Four miles an hour and panting. And my\nfellowship and the combination-room port. And, besides, Benham, there's\nthe expense. I can't afford the equestrian order.\"\n\n\"It's not so great.\"\n\n\"Not so great! I don't mean the essential expense. But--the incidentals.\nI don't know whether any one can realize how a poor man is hampered by\nthe dread of minor catastrophes. It isn't so much that he is afraid of\nbreaking his neck, Benham, as that he is afraid of breaking something he\nwill have to pay for. For instance--. Benham! how much did your little\nexpedition the other day--?\"\n\nHe stopped short and regarded his friend with round eyes and raised\neyebrows.\n\nA reluctant grin overspread Benham's face. He was beginning to see the\nhumour of the affair.\n\n\"The claim for the motor-bicycle isn't sent in yet. The repair of\nthe mudguards of the car is in dispute. Trinity Hall's crockery, the\nplate-glass window, the whip-lash and wheel and so forth, the hire of\nthe horse and trap, sundry gratuities.... I doubt if the total will come\nvery much under fifty pounds. And I seem to have lost a hat somewhere.\"\n\nBilly regarded his toes and cleared his throat.\n\n\"Depending as I do on a widowed mother in Brixton for all the\nexpenditure that isn't covered by my pot-hunting--\"\n\n\"Of course,\" said Benham, \"it wasn't a fair sample afternoon.\"\n\n\"Still--\"\n\n\"There's footer,\" said Benham, \"we might both play footer.\"\n\n\"Or boxing.\"\n\n\"And, anyhow, you must come with me when I drive again. I'm going to\nstart a trotter.\"\n\n\"If I miss another drive may I be--lost for ever,\" said Billy, with the\nutmost sincerity. \"Never more will I get down, Benham, wherever you may\ntake me. Short of muffing my fellowship I'm with you always.... Will it\nbe an American trotter?\"\n\n\"It will be the rawest, gauntest, ungainliest brute that ever scared the\nmotor-bicycles on the Northampton Road. It will have the legs and stride\nof an ostrich. It will throw its feet out like dealing cards. It will\nlift its head and look the sun in the eye like a vulture. It will have\nteeth like the English spinster in a French comic paper.... And we will\nfly....\"\n\n\"I shall enjoy it very much,\" said Prothero in a small voice after an\ninterval for reflection. \"I wonder where we shall fly. It will do us\nboth a lot of good. And I shall insure my life for a small amount in\nmy mother's interest.... Benham, I think I will, after all, take a\nwhiskey.... Life is short....\"\n\nHe did so and Benham strolled to the window and stood looking out upon\nthe great court.\n\n\"We might do something this afternoon,\" said Benham.\n\n\"Splendid idea,\" reflected Billy over his whiskey. \"Living hard and\nthinking hard. A sort of Intelligentsia that is BLOODED.... I shall, of\ncourse, come as far as I can with you.\"\n\n\n\n13\n\n\nIn one of the bureau drawers that White in this capacity of literary\nexecutor was examining, there were two documents that carried back\nright to these early days. They were both products of this long wide\nundergraduate argumentation that had played so large a part in the\nmaking of Benham. One recorded the phase of maximum opposition, and one\nwas the outcome of the concluding approach of the antagonists. They were\ndebating club essays. One had been read to a club in Pembroke, a club\ncalled the ENQUIRERS, of which White also had been a member, and as he\nturned it over he found the circumstances of its reading coming back to\nhis memory. He had been present, and Carnac's share in the discussion\nwith his shrill voice and stumpy gestures would alone have sufficed to\nhave made it a memorable occasion. The later one had been read to the\ndaughter club of the ENQUIRERS, the SOCIAL ENQUIRERS, in the year after\nWhite had gone down, and it was new to him.\n\nBoth these papers were folded flat and neatly docketed; they were rather\nyellow and a little dog-eared, and with the outer sheet pencilled over\nwith puzzling or illegible scribblings, Benham's memoranda for his\nreply. White took the earlier essay in his hand. At the head of the\nfirst page was written in large letters, \"Go slowly, speak to the man\nat the back.\" It brought up memories of his own experiences, of rows of\ngaslit faces, and of a friendly helpful voice that said, \"Speak up?\"\n\nOf course this was what happened to every intelligent contemporary, this\nencounter with ideas, this restatement and ventilation of the old truths\nand the old heresies. Only in this way does a man make a view his own,\nonly so does he incorporate it. These are our real turning points.\nThe significant, the essential moments in the life of any one worth\nconsideration are surely these moments when for the first time he faces\ntowards certain broad ideas and certain broad facts. Life nowadays\nconsists of adventures among generalizations. In class-rooms after the\nlecture, in studies in the small hours, among books or during solitary\nwalks, the drama of the modern career begins. Suddenly a man sees\nhis line, his intention. Yet though we are all of us writing long\nnovels--White's world was the literary world, and that is how it looked\nto him--which profess to set out the lives of men, this part of the\njourney, this crucial passage among the Sphinxes, is still done--when it\nis done at all--slightly, evasively. Why?\n\nWhite fell back on his professionalism. \"It does not make a book. It\nmakes a novel into a treatise, it turns it into a dissertation.\"\n\nBut even as White said this to himself he knew it was wrong, and it slid\nout of his thoughts again. Was not this objection to the play of ideas\nmerely the expression of that conservative instinct which fights for\nevery old convention? The traditional novel is a love story and takes\nideas for granted, it professes a hero but presents a heroine. And to\nbegin with at least, novels were written for the reading of heroines.\nMiss Lydia Languish sets no great store upon the contents of a man's\nhead. That is just the stuffing of the doll. Eyes and heart are her\ngame. And so there is never any more sphinx in the story than a lady may\nimpersonate. And as inevitably the heroine meets a man. In his own first\nsuccess, White reflected, the hero, before he had gone a dozen pages,\nmet a very pleasant young woman very pleasantly in a sunlit thicket;\nthe second opened at once with a bicycle accident that brought two young\npeople together so that they were never afterwards disentangled;\nthe third, failing to produce its heroine in thirty pages, had to be\nrearranged. The next--\n\nWhite returned from an unprofitable digression to the matter before him.\n\n\n\n14\n\n\nThe first of Benham's early essays was written in an almost boyish hand,\nit was youthfully amateurish in its nervous disposition to definitions\nand distinctions, and in the elaborate linking of part to part. It was\ncalled TRUE DEMOCRACY. Manifestly it was written before the incident of\nthe Trinity Hall plates, and most of it had been done after Prothero's\nvisit to Chexington. White could feel that now inaudible interlocutor.\nAnd there were even traces of Sir Godfrey Marayne's assertion that\ndemocracy was contrary to biology. From the outset it was clear that\nwhatever else it meant, True Democracy, following the analogy of True\nPoliteness, True Courage, True Honesty and True Marriage, did not mean\ndemocracy at all. Benham was, in fact, taking Prothero's word, and\ntrying to impose upon it his own solidifying and crystallizing opinion\nof life.\n\nThey were not as yet very large or well-formed crystals. The proposition\nhe struggled to develop was this, that True Democracy did not mean an\nequal share in the government, it meant an equal opportunity to share in\nthe government. Men were by nature and in the most various ways unequal.\nTrue Democracy aimed only at the removal of artificial inequalities....\n\nIt was on the truth of this statement, that men were by nature unequal,\nthat the debate had turned. Prothero was passionately against the idea\nat that time. It was, he felt, separating himself from Benham more and\nmore. He spoke with a personal bitterness. And he found his chief ally\nin a rigorous and voluble Frenchman named Carnac, an aggressive Roman\nCatholic, who opened his speech by saying that the first aristocrat was\nthe devil, and shocked Prothero by claiming him as probably the only\nother sound Christian in the room. Several biologists were present, and\none tall, fair youth with a wearisome forefinger tried to pin Carnac\nwith questions.\n\n\"But you must admit some men are taller than others?\"\n\n\"Then the others are broader.\"\n\n\"Some are smaller altogether.\"\n\n\"Nimbler--it's notorious.\"\n\n\"Some of the smaller are less nimble than the others.\"\n\n\"Then they have better nightmares. How can you tell?\"\n\nThe biologist was temporarily incapacitated, and the talk went on over\nhis prostrate attempts to rally and protest.\n\nA second biologist seemed to Benham to come nearer the gist of the\ndispute when he said that they were not discussing the importance of\nmen, but their relative inequalities. Nobody was denying the equal\nimportance of everybody. But there was a virtue of this man and a virtue\nof that. Nobody could dispute the equal importance of every wheel in a\nmachine, of every atom in the universe. Prothero and Carnac were angry\nbecause they thought the denial of absolute equality was a denial of\nequal importance. That was not so. Every man mattered in his place. But\npolitically, or economically, or intellectually that might be a lowly\nplace....\n\nAt this point Carnac interrupted with a whooping and great violence, and\na volley of obscure French colloquialisms.\n\nHe was understood to convey that the speaker was a Jew, and did not in\nthe least mean what he was saying....\n\n\n15\n\n\nThe second paper was an altogether maturer and more characteristic\nproduction. It was no longer necessary to answer Prothero. Prothero had\nbeen incorporated. And Benham had fairly got away with his great idea.\nIt was evident to White that this paper had been worked over on several\noccasions since its first composition and that Benham had intended\nto make it a part of his book. There were corrections in pencil and\ncorrections in a different shade of ink, and there was an unfinished\nnew peroration, that was clearly the latest addition of all. Yet\nits substance had been there always. It gave the youth just grown\nto manhood, but anyhow fully grown. It presented the far-dreaming\nintellectualist shaped.\n\nBenham had called it ARISTOCRACY. But he was far away by now from\npolitical aristocracy.\n\nThis time he had not begun with definitions and generalizations,\nbut with a curiously subjective appeal. He had not pretended to be\ntheorizing at large any longer, he was manifestly thinking of his own\nlife and as manifestly he was thinking of life as a matter of difficulty\nand unexpected thwartings.\n\n\"We see life,\" he wrote, \"not only life in the world outside us, but\nlife in our own selves, as an immense choice of possibilities; indeed,\nfor us in particular who have come up here, who are not under any urgent\nnecessity to take this line or that, life is apparently pure choice. It\nis quite easy to think we are all going to choose the pattern of life we\nlike best and work it out in our own way.... And, meanwhile, there is no\ngreat hurry....\n\n\"I want to begin by saying that choice isn't so easy and so necessary as\nit seems. We think we are going to choose presently, and in the end we\nmay never choose at all. Choice needs perhaps more energy than we think.\nThe great multitude of older people we can observe in the world outside\nthere, haven't chosen either in the matter of the world outside, where\nthey shall go, what they shall do, what part they shall play, or in\nthe matter of the world within, what they will be and what they are\ndetermined they will never be. They are still in much the same state of\nsuspended choice as we seem to be in, but in the meanwhile THINGS HAPPEN\nTO THEM. And things are happening to us, things will happen to us, while\nwe still suppose ourselves in the wings waiting to be consulted about\nthe casting of the piece....\n\n\"Nevertheless this immense appearance of choice which we get in the\nundergraduate community here, is not altogether illusion; it is more\nreality than illusion even if it has not the stable and complete reality\nit appears to have. And it is more a reality for us than it was for our\nfathers, and much more a reality now than it was a few centuries ago.\nThe world is more confused and multitudinous than ever it was, the\npracticable world far wider, and ourselves far less under the pressure\nof inflexible moulding forces and inevitable necessities than any\npreceding generations. I want to put very clearly how I see the new\nworld, the present world, the world of novel choice to which our youth\nand inexperience faces, and I want to define to you a certain selection\nof choices which I am going to call aristocratic, and to which it is our\nmanifest duty and destiny as the elect and favoured sons of our race to\ndirect ourselves.\n\n\"It isn't any choice of Hercules I mean, any mere alternative whether\nwe will be, how shall I put it?--the bridegrooms of pleasure or the\nbridegrooms of duty. It is infinitely vaster and more subtly moral than\nthat. There are a thousand good lives possible, of which we may have\none, lives which are soundly good, or a thousand bad lives, if you like,\nlives which are thoroughly bad--that's the old and perpetual choice,\nthat has always been--but what is more evident to me and more remarkable\nand disconcerting is that there are nowadays ten thousand muddled lives\nlacking even so much moral definition, even so much consistency as is\nnecessary for us to call them either good or bad, there are planless\nindeterminate lives, more and more of them, opening out as the possible\nlives before us, a perfect wilderness between salvation and damnation,\na wilderness so vast and crowded that at last it seems as though the\nway to either hell or heaven would be lost in its interminable futility.\nSuch planless indeterminate lives, plebeian lives, mere lives, fill the\nworld, and the spectacle of whole nations, our whole civilization, seems\nto me to re-echo this planlessness, this indeterminate confusion of\npurpose. Plain issues are harder and harder to find, it is as if they\nhad disappeared. Simple living is the countryman come to town. We are\ndeafened and jostled and perplexed. There are so many things afoot that\nwe get nothing....\n\n\"That is what is in my mind when I tell you that we have to gather\nourselves together much more than we think. We have to clench ourselves\nupon a chosen end. We have to gather ourselves together out of the swill\nof this brimming world.\n\n\"Or--we are lost....\"\n\n(\"Swill of this brimming world,\" said White. \"Some of this sounds\nuncommonly like Prothero.\" He mused for a moment and then resumed his\nreading.)\n\n\"That is what I was getting at when, three years ago, I made an attack\nupon Democracy to the mother society of this society, an attack that I\nexpressed ill and failed to drive home. That is what I have come down\nnow to do my best to make plainer. This age of confusion is Democracy;\nit is all that Democracy can ever give us. Democracy, if it means\nanything, means the rule of the planless man, the rule of the unkempt\nmind. It means as a necessary consequence this vast boiling up of\ncollectively meaningless things.\n\n\"What is the quality of the common man, I mean of the man that is common\nto all of us, the man who is the Standard for such men as Carnac,\nthe man who seems to be the ideal of the Catholic Democrat? He is the\ncreature of a few fundamental impulses. He begins in blind imitation of\nthe life about him. He lusts and takes a wife, he hungers and tills\na field or toils in some other way to earn a living, a mere aimless\nliving, he fears and so he does not wander, he is jealous and stays by\nhis wife and his job, is fiercely yet often stupidly and injuriously\ndefensive of his children and his possessions, and so until he wearies.\nThen he dies and needs a cemetery. He needs a cemetery because he is so\nafraid of dissolution that even when he has ceased to be, he still wants\na place and a grave to hold him together and prevent his returning to\nthe All that made him. Our chief impression of long ages of mankind\ncomes from its cemeteries. And this is the life of man, as the common\nman conceives and lives it. Beyond that he does not go, he never\ncomprehends himself collectively at all, the state happens about him;\nhis passion for security, his gregarious self-defensiveness, makes him\naccumulate upon himself until he congests in cities that have no\nsense of citizenship and states that have no structure; the clumsy,\ninconsecutive lying and chatter of his newspapers, his hoardings and\nmusic-halls gives the measure of his congested intelligences, the\nconfusion of ugly, half empty churches and chapels and meeting-halls\ngauge the intensity of his congested souls, the tricks and slow\nblundering dishonesties of Diet and Congress and Parliament are his\nstatecraft and his wisdom....\n\n\"I do not care if this instant I am stricken dead for pride. I say here\nnow to you and to High Heaven that THIS LIFE IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.\nI know there is a better life than this muddle about us, a better life\npossible now. I know it. A better individual life and a better public\nlife. If I had no other assurances, if I were blind to the glorious\nintimations of art, to the perpetually widening promise of science,\nto the mysterious beckonings of beauty in form and colour and the\ninaccessible mockery of the stars, I should still know this from the\ninsurgent spirit within me....\n\n\"Now this better life is what I mean when I talk of Aristocracy. This\nidea of a life breaking away from the common life to something better,\nis the consuming idea in my mind.\n\n\"Constantly, recurrently, struggling out of the life of the farm and\nthe shop, the inn and the market, the street and the crowd, is something\nthat is not of the common life. Its way of thinking is Science, its\ndreaming is Art, its will is the purpose of mankind. It is not the\ncommon thing. But also it is not an unnatural thing. It is not as common\nas a rat, but it is no less natural than a panther.\n\n\"For it is as natural to be an explorer as it is to be a potato grower,\nit is rarer but it is as natural; it is as natural to seek explanations\nand arrange facts as it is to make love, or adorn a hut, or show\nkindness to a child. It is a folly I will not even dispute about, that\nman's only natural implement is the spade. Imagination, pride, exalted\ndesire are just as much Man, as are hunger and thirst and sexual\ncuriosities and the panic dread of unknown things....\n\n\"Now you see better what I mean about choice. Now you see what I am\ndriving at. We have to choose each one for himself and also each one for\nthe race, whether we will accept the muddle of the common life, whether\nwe ourselves will be muddled, weakly nothings, children of luck,\nsteering our artful courses for mean success and tawdry honours, or\nwhether we will be aristocrats, for that is what it amounts to, each\none in the measure of his personal quality an aristocrat, refusing to be\nrestrained by fear, refusing to be restrained by pain, resolved to\nknow and understand up to the hilt of his understanding, resolved to\nsacrifice all the common stuff of his life to the perfection of his\npeculiar gift, a purged man, a trained, selected, artificial man, not\nsimply free, but lordly free, filled and sustained by pride. Whether\nyou or I make that choice and whether you or I succeed in realizing\nourselves, though a great matter to ourselves, is, I admit, a small\nmatter to the world. But the great matter is this, that THE CHOICE IS\nBEING MADE, that it will continue to be made, and that all around us, so\nthat it can never be arrested and darkened again, is the dawn of human\npossibility....\"\n\n(White could also see his dead friend's face with its enthusiastic\npaleness, its disordered hair and the glowing darknesses in the eyes.\nOn such occasions Benham always had an expression of ESCAPE. Temporary\nescape. And thus would his hand have clutched the reading-desk; thus\nwould his long fingers have rustled these dry papers.)\n\n\"Man has reached a point when a new life opens before him....\n\n\"The old habitual life of man is breaking up all about us, and for the\nnew life our minds, our imaginations, our habits and customs are all\nunprepared....\n\n\"It is only now, after some years of study and living, that I begin to\nrealize what this tremendous beginning we call Science means to mankind.\nEvery condition that once justified the rules and imperatives, the\nmanners and customs, the sentiments, the morality, the laws and\nlimitations which make up the common life, has been or is being\ndestroyed.... Two or three hundred years more and all that life will be\nas much a thing past and done with as the life that was lived in the age\nof unpolished stone....\n\n\"Man is leaving his ancestral shelters and going out upon the greatest\nadventure that ever was in space or time, he is doing it now, he is\ndoing it in us as I stand here and read to you.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE SECOND ~~ THE YOUNG MAN ABOUT TOWN\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nThe oldest novel in the world at any rate, White reflected, was a story\nwith a hero and no love interest worth talking about. It was the story\nof Tobias and how he came out from the shelters of his youth into this\nmagic and intricate world. Its heroine was incidental, part of the\nspoil, a seven times relict....\n\nWhite had not read the book of Tobit for many years, and what he was\nreally thinking of was not that ancient story at all, but Botticelli's\npicture, that picture of the sunlit morning of life. When you say\n\"Tobias\" that is what most intelligent people will recall. Perhaps you\nwill remember how gaily and confidently the young man strides along with\nthe armoured angel by his side. Absurdly enough, Benham and his dream of\nhigh aristocracy reminded White of that....\n\n\"We have all been Tobias in our time,\" said White.\n\nIf White had been writing this chapter he would have in all probability\ncalled it THE TOBIAS STAGE, forgetful that there was no Tobit behind\nBenham and an entirely different Sara in front of him.\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nFrom Cambridge Benham came to London. For the first time he was to live\nin London. Never before had he been in London for more than a few days\nat a time. But now, guided by his mother's advice, he was to have a flat\nin Finacue street, just round the corner from Desborough Street, a flat\nvery completely and delightfully furnished under her supervision. It had\nan admirable study, in which she had arranged not only his books, but\na number of others in beautiful old leather bindings that it had\namused her extremely to buy; it had a splendid bureau and business-like\nletter-filing cabinets, a neat little drawing-room and a dining-room,\nwell-placed abundant electric lights, and a man called Merkle whom\nshe had selected very carefully and who she felt would not only see to\nBenham's comfort but keep him, if necessary, up to the mark.\n\nThis man Merkle seemed quite unaware that humanity \"here and now\"--even\nas he was engaged in meticulously putting out Benham's clothes--was\n\"leaving its ancestral shelters and going out upon the greatest\nadventure that ever was in space or time.\" If he had been told as much\nby Benham he would probably have said, \"Indeed, sir,\" and proceeded\naccurately with his duties. And if Benham's voice had seemed to call for\nany additional remark, he would probably have added, \"It's 'igh time,\nsir, something of the sort was done. Will you have the white wesket as\nbefore, sir, or a fresh one this evening?... Unless it's a very special\noccasion, sir.... Exactly, sir. THANK you, sir.\"\n\nAnd when her son was properly installed in his apartments Lady Marayne\ncame round one morning with a large experienced-looking portfolio and\nrendered an account of her stewardship of his estate that was already\nsome months overdue. It was all very confused and confusing, and there\nwere inexplicable incidents, a heavy overdraft at the bank for example,\nbut this was Sir Godfrey's fault, she explained. \"He never would help\nme with any of this business,\" she said. \"I've had to add sometimes for\nHOURS. But, of course, you are a man, and when you've looked through it\nall, I know you'll understand.\"\n\nHe did look through it enough to see that it was undesirable that he\nshould understand too explicitly, and, anyhow, he was manifestly\nvery well off indeed, and the circumstances of the case, even as\nhe understood them, would have made any businesslike book-keeping\nungracious. The bankers submitted the corroborating account of\nsecurities, and he found himself possessed of his unconditional six\nthousand a year, with, as she put it, \"the world at his feet.\" On the\nwhole it seemed more wonderful to him now than when he had first heard\nof it. He kissed her and thanked her, and left the portfolio open for\nMerkle's entirely honest and respectful but very exact inspection, and\nwalked back with her to Desborough Street, and all the while he was\ncraving to ask the one tremendous question he knew he would never ask,\nwhich was just how exactly this beneficent Nolan came in....\n\nOnce or twice in the small hours, and on a number of other occasions,\nthis unspeakable riddle assumed a portentous predominance in his mind.\nHe was forced back upon his inner consciousness for its consideration.\nHe could discuss it with nobody else, because that would have been\ndiscussing his mother.\n\nProbably most young men who find themselves with riches at large in the\nworld have some such perplexity as this mixed in with the gift. Such men\nas the Cecils perhaps not, because they are in the order of things, the\nrich young Jews perhaps not, because acquisition is their principle,\nbut for most other intelligent inheritors there must be this twinge of\nconscientious doubt. \"Why particularly am I picked out for so tremendous\nan advantage?\" If the riddle is not Nolan, then it is rent, or it is the\nsocial mischief of the business, or the particular speculative COUP that\nestablished their fortune.\n\n\"PECUNIA NON OLET,\" Benham wrote, \"and it is just as well. Or the\nwest-ends of the world would reek with deodorizers. Restitution is\ninconceivable; how and to whom? And in the meanwhile here we are lifted\nup by our advantage to a fantastic appearance of opportunity. Whether\nthe world looks to us or not to do tremendous things, it ought to look\nto us. And above all we ought to look to ourselves. RICHESSE OBLIGE.\"\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nIt is not to be supposed that Benham came to town only with a general\ntheory of aristocracy. He had made plans for a career. Indeed, he had\nplans for several careers. None of them when brought into contrast with\nthe great spectacle of London retained all the attractiveness that had\nsaturated them at their inception.\n\nThey were all more or less political careers. Whatever a democratic man\nmay be, Prothero and he had decided that an aristocratic man is a public\nman. He is made and protected in what he is by laws and the state and\nhis honour goes out to the state. The aristocrat has no right to be\na voluptuary or a mere artist or a respectable nonentity, or any such\npurely personal things. Responsibility for the aim and ordering of the\nworld is demanded from him as imperatively as courage.\n\nBenham's deliberate assumption of the equestrian role brought him\ninto contact with a new set of acquaintances, conscious of political\ndestinies. They were amiable, hard young men, almost affectedly\nunaffected; they breakfasted before dawn to get in a day's hunting, and\nthey saw to it that Benham's manifest determination not to discredit\nhimself did not lead to his breaking his neck. Their bodies were\nbeautifully tempered, and their minds were as flabby as Prothero's body.\nAmong them were such men as Lord Breeze and Peter Westerton, and that\ncurrent set of Corinthians who supposed themselves to be resuscitating\nthe Young England movement and Tory Democracy. Poor movements which\nindeed have never so much lived as suffered chronic resuscitation. These\nwere days when Tariff Reform was only an inglorious possibility for the\nTory Party, and Young England had yet to demonstrate its mental quality\nin an anti-socialist campaign. Seen from the perspectives of Cambridge\nand Chexington, the Tory party was still a credible basis for the\nadventure of a young man with an aristocratic theory in his mind.\n\nThese were the days when the strain and extremity of a dangerous\ncolonial war were fresh in people's minds, when the quality of\nthe public consciousness was braced up by its recent response to\nunanticipated demands. The conflict of stupidities that had caused\nthe war was overlaid and forgotten by a hundred thousand devotions,\nby countless heroic deaths and sufferings, by a pacification largely\nconceived and broadly handled. The nation had displayed a belated regard\nfor its honour and a sustained passion for great unities. It was still\npossible for Benham to regard the empire as a splendid opportunity,\nand London as the conceivable heart of the world. He could think of\nParliament as a career, and of a mingling of aristocratic socialism\nbased on universal service with a civilizing imperialism as a\npurpose....\n\nBut his thoughts had gone wider and deeper than that....\n\nAlready when Benham came to London he had begun to dream of\npossibilities that went beyond the accidental states and empires of\nto-day. Prothero's mind, replete with historical detail, could find\nnothing but absurdity in the alliances and dynasties and loyalties of\nour time. \"Patched up things, Benham, temporary, pretentious. All very\nwell for the undignified man, the democratic man, to take shelter under,\nall very well for the humourist to grin and bear, all very well for the\ncrowd and the quack, but not for the aristocrat--No!--his mind cuts like\nsteel and burns like fire. Lousy sheds they are, plastered hoardings...\nand such a damned nuisance too! For any one who wants to do honourable\nthings! With their wars and their diplomacies, their tariffs and\ntheir encroachments; all their humbugging struggles, their bloody and\nmonstrous struggles, that finally work out to no end at all.... If you\nare going for the handsome thing in life then the world has to be a\nunited world, Benham, as a matter of course. That was settled when\nthe railways and the telegraph came. Telephones, wireless telegraphy,\naeroplanes insist on it. We've got to mediatise all this stuff, all\nthese little crowns and boundaries and creeds, and so on, that stand\nin the way. Just as Italy had to be united in spite of all the rotten\nlittle dukes and princes and republics, just as Germany had to be united\nin spite of its scores of kingdoms and duchies and liberties, so now\nthe world. Things as they are may be fun for lawyers and politicians\nand court people and--douaniers; they may suit the loan-mongers and\nthe armaments shareholders, they may even be more comfortable for the\nmiddle-aged, but what, except as an inconvenience, does that matter to\nyou or me?\"\n\nProthero always pleased Benham when he swept away empires. There was\nalways a point when the rhetoric broke into gesture.\n\n\"We've got to sweep them away, Benham,\" he said, with a wide gesture of\nhis arm. \"We've got to sweep them all away.\"\n\nProthero helped himself to some more whiskey, and spoke hastily,\nbecause he was afraid some one else might begin. He was never safe from\ninterruption in his own room. The other young men present sucked at\ntheir pipes and regarded him doubtfully. They were never quite certain\nwhether Prothero was a prophet or a fool. They could not understand a\nmixed type, and he was so manifestly both.\n\n\"The only sane political work for an intelligent man is to get the\nworld-state ready. For that we have to prepare an aristocracy--\"\n\n\"Your world-state will be aristocratic?\" some one interpolated.\n\n\"Of course it will be aristocratic. How can uninformed men think all\nround the globe? Democracy dies five miles from the parish pump. It will\nbe an aristocratic republic of all the capable men in the world....\"\n\n\"Of course,\" he added, pipe in mouth, as he poured out his whiskey,\n\"it's a big undertaking. It's an affair of centuries....\"\n\nAnd then, as a further afterthought: \"All the more reason for getting to\nwork at it....\"\n\nIn his moods of inspiration Prothero would discourse through the tobacco\nsmoke until that great world-state seemed imminent--and Part Two in the\nTripos a thing relatively remote. He would talk until the dimly-lit room\nabout him became impalpable, and the young men squatting about it in\nelaborately careless attitudes caught glimpses of cities that are still\nto be, bridges in wild places, deserts tamed and oceans conquered,\nmankind no longer wasted by bickerings, going forward to the conquest of\nthe stars....\n\nAn aristocratic world-state; this political dream had already taken\nhold of Benham's imagination when he came to town. But it was a dream,\nsomething that had never existed, something that indeed may never\nmaterialize, and such dreams, though they are vivid enough in a study at\nnight, fade and vanish at the rustle of a daily newspaper or the\nsound of a passing band. To come back again.... So it was with Benham.\nSometimes he was set clearly towards this world-state that Prothero\nhad talked into possibility. Sometimes he was simply abreast of the\npatriotic and socially constructive British Imperialism of Breeze and\nWesterton. And there were moods when the two things were confused in his\nmind, and the glamour of world dominion rested wonderfully on the slack\nand straggling British Empire of Edward the Seventh--and Mr. Rudyard\nKipling and Mr. Chamberlain. He did go on for a time honestly\nentertaining both these projects in his mind, each at its different\nlevel, the greater impalpable one and the lesser concrete one within it.\nIn some unimaginable way he could suppose that the one by some miracle\nof ennoblement--and neglecting the Frenchman, the Russian, the German,\nthe American, the Indian, the Chinaman, and, indeed, the greater part of\nmankind from the problem--might become the other....\n\nAll of which is recorded here, without excess of comment, as it\nhappened, and as, in a mood of astonished reminiscences, he came finally\nto perceive it, and set it down for White's meditative perusal.\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nBut to the enthusiasm of the young, dreams have something of the\nsubstance of reality and realities, something of the magic of dreams.\nThe London to which Benham came from Cambridge and the disquisitions of\nProthero was not the London of a mature and disillusioned vision. It was\nLondon seen magnified and distorted through the young man's crystalline\nintentions. It had for him a quality of multitudinous, unquenchable\nactivity. Himself filled with an immense appetite for life, he was\nunable to conceive of London as fatigued. He could not suspect these\nstatesmen he now began to meet and watch, of jaded wills and petty\nspites, he imagined that all the important and influential persons in\nthis large world of affairs were as frank in their private lives and as\nunembarrassed in their financial relationships as his untainted self.\nAnd he had still to reckon with stupidity. He believed in the statecraft\nof leader-writers and the sincerity of political programmes. And so\nregarded, what an avenue to Empire was Whitehall! How momentous was the\nsunrise in St. James's Park, and how significant the clustering knot of\nlisteners and speakers beneath the tall column that lifts our Nelson to\nthe windy sky!\n\nFor a time Benham was in love with the idea of London. He got maps of\nLondon and books about London. He made plans to explore its various\nregions. He tried to grasp it all, from the conscious picturesqueness of\nits garden suburbs to the factories of Croydon, from the clerk-villadoms\nof Ealing to the inky streams of Bow. In those days there were passenger\nsteamboats that would take one from the meadows of Hampton Court past\nthe whole spectacle of London out to the shipping at Greenwich and the\ntowed liners, the incessant tugs, the heaving portals of the sea....\nHis time was far too occupied for him to carry out a tithe of these\nexpeditions he had planned, but he had many walks that bristled with\nimpressions. Northward and southward, eastward and westward a dreaming\nyoung man could wander into a wilderness of population, polite or\nsombre, poor, rich, or middle-class, but all ceaselessly active, all\nurgently pressing, as it seemed, to their part in the drama of the\ncoming years. He loved the late afternoon, when every artery is injected\nand gorged with the multitudinous home-going of the daily workers, he\nloved the time of lighting up, and the clustering excitements of the\nlate hours. And he went out southward and eastward into gaunt regions of\nreeking toil. As yet he knew nothing of the realities of industrialism.\nHe saw only the beauty of the great chimneys that rose against the\nsullen smoke-barred sunsets, and he felt only the romance of the lurid\nshuddering flares that burst out from squat stacks of brickwork and lit\nthe emptiness of strange and slovenly streets....\n\nAnd this London was only the foreground of the great scene upon which\nhe, as a prosperous, well-befriended young Englishman, was free to\nplay whatever part he could. This narrow turbid tidal river by which he\nwalked ran out under the bridges eastward beneath the grey-blue clouds\ntowards Germany, towards Russia, and towards Asia, which still seemed in\nthose days so largely the Englishman's Asia. And when you turned about\nat Blackfriars Bridge this sense of the round world was so upon you\nthat you faced not merely Westminster, but the icy Atlantic and America,\nwhich one could yet fancy was a land of Englishmen--Englishmen a little\nestranged. At any rate they assimilated, they kept the tongue. The\nshipping in the lower reaches below the Tower there carried the flags of\nevery country under the sky.... As he went along the riverside he met a\ngroup of dusky students, Chinese or Japanese. Cambridge had abounded in\nIndians; and beneath that tall clock tower at Westminster it seemed as\nthough the world might centre. The background of the Englishman's world\nreached indeed to either pole, it went about the earth, his background\nit was--for all that he was capable of doing. All this had awaited\nhim....\n\nIs it any wonder if a young man with an excitable imagination came at\ntimes to the pitch of audible threats? If the extreme indulgence of his\nopportunity and his sense of ability and vigour lifted his vanity at\nmoments to the kingly pitch? If he ejaculated and made a gesture or so\nas he went along the Embankment?\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nIn the disquisition upon choice that opened Benham's paper on\nARISTOCRACY, he showed himself momentarily wiser than his day-dreams.\nFor in these day-dreams he did seem to himself to be choosing among\nunlimited possibilities. Yet while he dreamt other influences were\ndirecting his movements. There were for instance his mother, Lady\nMarayne, who saw a very different London from what he did, and his\nmother Dame Nature, who cannot see London at all. She was busy in his\nblood as she is busy in the blood of most healthy young men; common\nexperience must fill the gaps for us; and patiently and thoroughly\nshe was preparing for the entrance of that heroine, whom not the most\nself-centred of heroes can altogether avoid....\n\nAnd then there was the power of every day. Benham imagined himself at\nlarge on his liberating steed of property while indeed he was mounted\non the made horse of Civilization; while he was speculating whither he\nshould go, he was already starting out upon the round. One hesitates\nupon the magnificent plan and devotion of one's lifetime and meanwhile\nthere is usage, there are engagements. Every morning came Merkle, the\nembodiment of the established routine, the herald of all that the world\nexpected and required Benham to be and do. Usually he awakened Benham\nwith the opening of his door and the soft tinkle of the curtain rings as\nhe let in the morning light. He moved softly about the room, gathering\nup and removing the crumpled hulls of yesterday; that done he reappeared\nat the bedside with a cup of admirable tea and one thin slice of\nbread-and-butter, reported on the day's weather, stood deferential for\ninstructions. \"You will be going out for lunch, sir. Very good, sir.\nWhite slips of course, sir. You will go down into the country in the\nafternoon? Will that be the serge suit, sir, or the brown?\"\n\nThese matters settled, the new aristocrat could yawn and stretch like\nany aristocrat under the old dispensation, and then as the sound of\nrunning water from the bathroom ceased, stick his toes out of bed.\n\nThe day was tremendously indicated. World-states and aristocracies of\nsteel and fire, things that were as real as coal-scuttles in Billy's\nrooms away there at Cambridge, were now remoter than Sirius.\n\nHe was expected to shave, expected to bath, expected to go in to\nthe bright warmth and white linen and silver and china of his\nbreakfast-table. And there he found letters and invitations, loaded with\nexpectation. And beyond the coffee-pot, neatly folded, lay the TIMES,\nand the DAILY NEWS and the TELEGRAPH all with an air of requiring his\nattention. There had been more fighting in Thibet and Mr. Ritchie had\nmade a Free Trade speech at Croydon. The Japanese had torpedoed another\nRussian ironclad and a British cruiser was ashore in the East Indies. A\nman had been found murdered in an empty house in Hoxton and the King\nhad had a conversation with General Booth. Tadpole was in for North\nWinchelsea, beating Taper by nine votes, and there had been a new cut\nin the Atlantic passenger rates. He was expected to be interested and\nexcited by these things.\n\nPresently the telephone bell would ring and he would hear the clear\nlittle voice of his mother full of imperative expectations. He would be\nround for lunch? Yes, he would be round to lunch. And the afternoon, had\nhe arranged to do anything with his afternoon? No!--put off Chexington\nuntil tomorrow. There was this new pianist, it was really an EXPERIENCE,\nand one might not get tickets again. And then tea at Panton's. It was\nrather fun at Panton's.... Oh!--Weston Massinghay was coming to lunch.\nHe was a useful man to know. So CLEVER.... So long, my dear little Son,\ntill I see you....\n\nSo life puts out its Merkle threads, as the poacher puts his hair noose\nabout the pheasant's neck, and while we theorize takes hold of us....\n\nIt came presently home to Benham that he had been down from Cambridge\nfor ten months, and that he was still not a step forward with the\nrealization of the new aristocracy. His political career waited. He had\ndone a quantity of things, but their net effect was incoherence. He had\nnot been merely passive, but his efforts to break away into creative\nrealities had added to rather than diminished his accumulating sense of\nfutility.\n\nThe natural development of his position under the influence of Lady\nMarayne had enormously enlarged the circle of his acquaintances. He had\ntaken part in all sorts of social occasions, and sat and listened to\na representative selection of political and literary and social\npersonages, he had been several times to the opera and to a great number\nand variety of plays, he had been attentively inconspicuous in several\nreally good week-end parties. He had spent a golden October in North\nItaly with his mother, and escaped from the glowing lassitude of\nVenice for some days of climbing in the Eastern Alps. In January, in an\noutbreak of enquiry, he had gone with Lionel Maxim to St. Petersburg and\nhad eaten zakuska, brightened his eyes with vodka, talked with a number\nof charming people of the war that was then imminent, listened to\ngipsy singers until dawn, careered in sledges about the most silent\nand stately of capitals, and returned with Lionel, discoursing upon\nautocracy and assassination, Japan, the Russian destiny, and the\ngovernment of Peter the Great. That excursion was the most after his\nheart of all the dispersed employments of his first year. Through the\nrest of the winter he kept himself very fit, and still further qualified\nthat nervous dislike for the horse that he had acquired from Prothero by\nhunting once a week in Essex. He was incurably a bad horseman; he rode\nwithout sympathy, he was unready and convulsive at hedges and ditches,\nand he judged distances badly. His white face and rigid seat and a\ncertain joylessness of bearing in the saddle earned him the singular\nnickname, which never reached his ears, of the \"Galvanized Corpse.\"\nHe got through, however, at the cost of four quite trifling spills\nand without damaging either of the horses he rode. And his physical\nself-respect increased.\n\nOn his writing-desk appeared a few sheets of manuscript that increased\nonly very slowly. He was trying to express his Cambridge view of\naristocracy in terms of Finacue Street, West.\n\nThe artistic and intellectual movements of London had made their\nvarious demands upon his time and energies. Art came to him with a\nnoble assumption of his interest and an intention that presently became\nunpleasantly obvious to sell him pictures that he did not want to buy\nand explain away pictures that he did. He bought one or two modern\nachievements, and began to doubt if art and aristocracy had any\nnecessary connection. At first he had accepted the assumption that they\nhad. After all, he reflected, one lives rather for life and things than\nfor pictures of life and things or pictures arising out of life and\nthings. This Art had an air of saying something, but when one came to\ngrips with it what had it to say? Unless it was Yah! The drama, and more\nparticularly the intellectual drama, challenged his attention. In the\nhands of Shaw, Barker, Masefield, Galsworthy, and Hankin, it, too, had\nan air of saying something, but he found it extremely difficult to join\non to his own demands upon life anything whatever that the intellectual\ndrama had the air of having said. He would sit forward in the front row\nof the dress-circle with his cheek on his hand and his brow slightly\nknit. His intentness amused observant people. The drama that did not\nprofess to be intellectual he went to with Lady Marayne, and usually\non first nights. Lady Marayne loved a big first night at St. James's\nTheatre or His Majesty's. Afterwards, perhaps, Sir Godfrey would join\nthem at a supper party, and all sorts of clever and amusing people would\nbe there saying keen intimate things about each other. He met Yeats, who\ntold amusing stories about George Moore, and afterwards he met George\nMoore, who told amusing stories about Yeats, and it was all, he felt,\ngreat fun for the people who were in it. But he was not in it, and he\nhad no very keen desire to be in it. It wasn't his stuff. He had,\nthough they were nowadays rather at the back of his mind, quite other\nintentions. In the meanwhile all these things took up his time and\ndistracted his attention.\n\nThere was, as yet, no practicable aviation to beguile a young man of\nspirit, but there were times when Benham found himself wondering whether\nthere might not be something rather creditable in the possession and\ncontrol of a motor-car of exceptional power. Only one might smash people\nup. Should an aristocrat be deterred by the fear of smashing people up?\nIf it is a selfish fear of smashing people up, if it is nerves rather\nthan pity? At any rate it did not come to the car.\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nAmong other things that delayed Benham very greatly in the development\nof his aristocratic experiments was the advice that was coming to him\nfrom every quarter. It came in extraordinary variety and volume, but\nalways it had one unvarying feature. It ignored and tacitly contradicted\nhis private intentions.\n\nWe are all of us disposed to be propagandists of our way of living, and\nthe spectacle of a wealthy young man quite at large is enough to excite\nthe most temperate of us without distinction of age or sex. \"If I were\nyou,\" came to be a familiar phrase in his ear. This was particularly the\ncase with political people; and they did it not only from the natural\ninfirmity of humanity, but because, when they seemed reluctant or\nsatisfied with him as he was, Lady Marayne egged them on.\n\nThere was a general assumption that he was to go into Parliament, and\nmost of his counsellors assumed further that on the whole his natural\nsympathies would take him into the Conservative party. But it was\npointed out to him that just at present the Liberal party was the party\nof a young man's opportunity; sooner or later the swing of the pendulum\nwhich would weed the Conservatives and proliferate Liberals was bound to\ncome, there was always more demand and opportunity for candidates on\nthe Liberal side, the Tariff Reformers were straining their ministerial\nmajority to the splitting point, and most of the old Liberal leaders had\ndied off during the years of exile. The party was no longer\ndominated; it would tolerate ideas. A young man who took a distinctive\nline--provided it was not from the party point of view a vexatious or\nimpossible line--might go very rapidly far and high. On the other hand,\nit was urged upon him that the Tariff Reform adventure called also\nfor youth and energy. But there, perhaps, there was less scope for\nthe distinctive line--and already they had Garvin. Quite a number\nof Benham's friends pointed out to him the value of working out some\nspecial aspect of our national political interests. A very useful\nspeciality was the Balkans. Mr. Pope, the well-known publicist, whose\nvery sound and considerable reputation was based on the East Purblow\nLabour Experiment, met Benham at lunch and proposed to go with him in\na spirit of instructive association to the Balkans, rub up their Greek\ntogether, and settle the problem of Albania. He wanted, he said, a\nforeign speciality to balance his East Purblow interest. But Lady Beach\nMandarin warned Benham against the Balkans; the Balkans were getting\nto be too handy for Easter and summer holidays, and now that there were\nseveral good hotels in Servia and Montenegro and Sofia, they were\nbeing overdone. Everybody went to the Balkans and came back with a pet\nnationality. She loathed pet nationalities. She believed most people\nloathed them nowadays. It was stale: it was GLADSTONIAN. She was all for\nspecialization in social reform. She thought Benham ought to join the\nFabian Society and consult the Webbs. Quite a number of able young men\nhad been placed with the assistance of the Webbs. They were, she said,\n\"a perfect fount....\" Two other people, independently of each other,\npointed out to Benham the helpfulness of a few articles in the\nhalf-crown monthlies....\n\n\"What are the assumptions underlying all this?\" Benham asked himself in\na phase of lucidity.\n\nAnd after reflection. \"Good God! The assumptions! What do they think\nwill satisfy me?...\"\n\nEverybody, however, did not point to Parliament. Several people seemed\nto think Travel, with a large T, was indicated. One distant cousin of\nSir Godfrey's, the kind of man of the world who has long moustaches, was\nfor big game shooting. \"Get right out of all this while you are young,\"\nhe said. \"There's nothing to compare with stopping a charging lion\nat twenty yards. I've done it, my boy. You can come back for all this\npow-wow afterwards.\" He gave the diplomatic service as a second choice.\n\"There you are,\" he said, \"first-rate social position, nothing to do,\ntheatres, operas, pretty women, colour, life. The best of good times.\nBarring Washington, that is. But Washington, they say, isn't as bad as\nit used to be--since Teddy has Europeanized 'em....\"\n\nEven the Reverend Harold Benham took a subdued but thoughtful share in\nhis son's admonition. He came up to the flat--due precautions were taken\nto prevent a painful encounter--he lunched at his son's new club, and he\nwas visibly oppressed by the contrast between the young man's youthful\nfortunes and his own. As visibly he bore up bravely. \"There are few men,\nPoff, who would not envy you your opportunities,\" he said. \"You have the\nFeast of Life spread out at your feet.... I hope you have had yourself\nput up for the Athenaeum. They say it takes years. When I was a young\nman--and ambitious--I thought that some day I might belong to the\nAthenaeum.... One has to learn....\"\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nAnd with an effect of detachment, just as though it didn't belong to\nthe rest of him at all, there was beginning a sort of backstairs and\nunderside to Benham's life. There is no need to discuss how inevitable\nthat may or may not be in the case of a young man of spirit and\nlarge means, nor to embark upon the discussion of the temptations and\nopportunities of large cities. Several ladies, of various positions and\nqualities, had reflected upon his manifest need of education. There was\nin particular Mrs. Skelmersdale, a very pretty little widow with hazel\neyes, black hair, a mobile mouth, and a pathetic history, who talked of\nold music to him and took him to a Dolmetsch concert in Clifford's Inn,\nand expanded that common interest to a general participation in\nhis indefinite outlook. She advised him about his probable\npolitics--everybody did that--but when he broke through his usual\nreserve and suggested views of his own, she was extraordinarily\nsympathetic. She was so sympathetic and in such a caressing way that\nshe created a temporary belief in her understanding, and it was quite\nimperceptibly that he was drawn into the discussion of modern ethical\nproblems. She herself was a rather stimulating instance of modern\nethical problems. She told him something of her own story, and then\ntheir common topics narrowed down very abruptly. He found he could help\nher in several ways. There is, unhappily, a disposition on the part of\nmany people, who ought to know better, to regard a role played by Joseph\nduring his earlier days in Egypt as a ridiculous one. This point of view\nbecame very inopportunely dominant in Benham's mind when he was lunching\nTETE A TETE with Mrs. Skelmersdale at her flat....\n\nThe ensuing intimacy was of an entirely concealed and respectable\nnature, but a certain increased preoccupation in his manner set Lady\nMarayne thinking. He had as a matter of fact been taken by surprise.\n\nStill he perceived that it is no excuse for a man that he has been taken\nby surprise. Surprises in one's own conduct ought not to happen. When\nthey do happen then an aristocrat ought to stick to what he had done. He\nwas now in a subtle and complicated relationship to Mrs. Skelmersdale,\na relationship in which her pride had become suddenly a matter of\ntremendous importance. Once he had launched himself upon this affair, it\nwas clear to him that he owed it to her never to humiliate her. And to\ngo back upon himself now would be a tremendous humiliation for her. You\nsee, he had helped her a little financially. And she looked to him, she\nwanted him....\n\nShe wasn't, he knew, altogether respectable. Indeed, poor dear, her\nethical problems, already a little worn, made her seem at times anything\nbut respectable. He had met her first one evening at Jimmy Gluckstein's\nwhen he was forming his opinion of Art. Her manifest want of interest\nin pictures had attracted him. And that had led to music. And to the\nmention of a Clementi piano, that short, gentle, sad, old, little sort\nof piano people will insist upon calling a spinet, in her flat.\n\nAnd so to this....\n\nIt was very wonderful and delicious, this first indulgence of sense.\n\nIt was shabby and underhand.\n\nThe great god Pan is a glorious god. (And so was Swinburne.) And what\ncan compare with the warmth of blood and the sheen of sunlit limbs?\n\nBut Priapus....\n\nShe was the most subtle, delightful and tender of created beings.\n\nShe had amazing streaks of vulgarity.\n\nAnd some astonishing friends.\n\nOnce she had seemed to lead the talk deliberately to money matters.\n\nShe loved him and desired him. There was no doubt of it.\n\nThere was a curious effect about her as though when she went round the\ncorner she would become somebody else. And a curious recurrent feeling\nthat round the corner there was somebody else.\n\nHe had an extraordinary feeling that his mother knew about this\nbusiness. This feeling came from nothing in her words or acts, but from\nsome indefinable change in her eyes and bearing towards him. But how\ncould she know?\n\nIt was unlikely that she and Mrs. Skelmersdale would ever meet, and it\nseemed to him that it would be a particularly offensive incident for\nthem to meet.\n\nThere were times now when life took on a grey and boring quality such\nas it had never had before he met Mrs. Skelmersdale, and the only\nremedy was to go to her. She could restore his nervous tranquillity, his\nfeeling of solidity and reality, his pride in himself. For a time, that\nis.\n\nNevertheless his mind was as a whole pervaded by the feeling that he\nought not to have been taken by surprise.\n\nAnd he had the clearest conviction in his mind that if now he could be\nput back again to the day before that lunch....\n\nNo! he should not have gone there to lunch.\n\nHe had gone there to see her Clementi piano.\n\nHad he or had he not thought beforehand of any other possibility?\n\nOn a point so vital his memory was curiously unsure.\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nThe worry and disorganization of Benham's life and thoughts increased as\nthe spring advanced. His need in some way to pull things together became\noverpowering. He began to think of Billy Prothero, more and more did it\nseem desirable to have a big talk with Billy and place everything that\nhad got disturbed. Benham thought of going to Cambridge for a week of\nexhaustive evenings. Small engagements delayed that expedition....\n\nThen came a day in April when all the world seemed wrong to Benham. He\nwas irritable; his will was unstable; whatever presented itself to be\ndone presented itself as undesirable; he could settle to nothing. He had\nbeen keeping away from Mrs. Skelmersdale and in the morning there came a\nlittle note from her designed to correct this abstention. She understood\nthe art of the attractive note. But he would not decide to go to her. He\nleft the note unanswered.\n\nThen came his mother at the telephone and it became instantly certain to\nBenham that he could not play the dutiful son that evening. He answered\nher that he could not come to dinner. He had engaged himself. \"Where?\"\n\n\"With some men.\"\n\nThere was a pause and then his mother's voice came, flattened by\ndisappointment. \"Very well then, little Poff. Perhaps I shall see you\nto-morrow.\"\n\nHe replaced the receiver and fretted back into his study, where the\nnotes on aristocracy lay upon his desk, the notes he had been pretending\nto work over all the morning.\n\n\"Damned liar!\" he said, and then, \"Dirty liar!\" He decided to lunch at\nthe club, and in the afternoon he was moved to telephone an appointment\nwith his siren. And having done that he was bound to keep it.\n\nAbout one o'clock in the morning he found himself walking back to\nFinacue Street. He was no longer a fretful conflict of nerves, but if\nanything he was less happy than he had been before. It seemed to him\nthat London was a desolate and inglorious growth.\n\nLondon ten years ago was much less nocturnal than it is now. And not so\nbrightly lit. Down the long streets came no traffic but an occasional\nhansom. Here and there a cat halted or bolted in the road. Near\nPiccadilly a policeman hovered artfully in a doorway, and then came a\nfew belated prostitutes waylaying the passers-by, and a few youths and\nmen, wearily lust driven.\n\nAs he turned up New Bond Street he saw a figure that struck him\nas familiar. Surely!--it was Billy Prothero! Or at any rate it was\nastonishingly like Billy Prothero. He glanced again and the likeness\nwas more doubtful. The man had his back to Benham, he was halting and\nlooking back at a woman.\n\nBy some queer flash of intuition it came to Benham that even if this\nwas not Prothero, still Prothero did these things. It might very well\nbe Prothero even, though, as he now saw, it wasn't. Everybody did these\nthings....\n\nIt came into Benham's head for the first time that life could be\ntiresome.\n\nThis Bond Street was a tiresome place; with its shops all shut and\nmuffled, its shops where in the crowded daytime one bought costly\nfurniture, costly clothes, costly scent, sweets, bibelots, pictures,\njewellery, presents of all sorts, clothes for Mrs. Skelmersdale, sweets\nfor Mrs. Skelmersdale, presents for Mrs. Skelmersdale, all the elaborate\nfittings and equipage of--THAT!\n\n\"Good night, dear,\" a woman drifted by him.\n\n\"I've SAID good night,\" he cried, \"I've SAID good night,\" and so went\non to his flat. The unquenchable demand, the wearisome insatiability\nof sex! When everything else has gone, then it shows itself bare in the\nbleak small hours. And at first it had seemed so light a matter! He went\nto bed, feeling dog-tired, he went to bed at an hour and with a finished\ncompleteness that Merkle would have regarded as entirely becoming in a\nyoung gentleman of his position.\n\nAnd a little past three o'clock in the morning he awoke to a mood of\nindescribable desolation. He awoke with a start to an agony of remorse\nand self-reproach.\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nFor a time he lay quite still staring at the darkness, then he groaned\nand turned over. Then, suddenly, like one who fancies he hears a strange\nnoise, he sat up in bed and listened. \"Oh, God!\" he said at last.\n\nAnd then: \"Oh! The DIRTINESS of life! The dirty muddle of life!\n\n\"What are we doing with life? What are we all doing with life?\n\n\"It isn't only this poor Milly business. This only brings it to a head.\nOf course she wants money....\"\n\nHis thoughts came on again.\n\n\"But the ugliness!\n\n\"Why did I begin it?\"\n\nHe put his hands upon his knees and pressed his eyes against the backs\nof his hands and so remained very still, a blankness beneath his own\nquestion.\n\nAfter a long interval his mind moved again.\n\nAnd now it was as if he looked upon his whole existence, he seemed to\nsee in a large, clear, cold comprehensiveness, all the wasted days, the\nfruitless activities, the futilities, the perpetual postponements\nthat had followed his coming to London. He saw it all as a joyless\nindulgence, as a confusion of playthings and undisciplined desires, as\na succession of days that began amiably and weakly, that became steadily\nmore crowded with ignoble and trivial occupations, that had sunken now\nto indignity and uncleanness. He was overwhelmed by that persuasion,\nwhich only freshly soiled youth can feel in its extreme intensity, that\nlife was slipping away from him, that the sands were running out, that\nin a little while his existence would be irretrievably lost.\n\nBy some trick of the imagination he saw life as an interminable Bond\nStreet, lit up by night lamps, desolate, full of rubbish, full of the\nvery best rubbish, trappings, temptations, and down it all he drove, as\nthe damned drive, wearily, inexplicably.\n\nWHAT ARE WE UP TO WITH LIFE! WHAT ARE WE MAKING OF LIFE!\n\nBut hadn't he intended to make something tremendous of life? Hadn't he\ncome to London trailing a glory?...\n\nHe began to remember it as a project. It was the project of a great\nWorld-State sustained by an aristocracy of noble men. He was to have\nbeen one of those men, too fine and far-reaching for the dull manoeuvers\nof such politics as rule the world to-day. The project seemed still\nlarge, still whitely noble, but now it was unlit and dead, and in the\nforeground he sat in the flat of Mrs. Skelmersdale, feeling dissipated\nand fumbling with his white tie. And she was looking tired. \"God!\" he\nsaid. \"How did I get there?\"\n\nAnd then suddenly he reached out his arms in the darkness and prayed\naloud to the silences.\n\n\"Oh, God! Give me back my visions! Give me back my visions!\"\n\nHe could have imagined he heard a voice calling upon him to come out\ninto life, to escape from the body of this death. But it was his own\nvoice that called to him....\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nThe need for action became so urgent in him, that he got right out of\nhis bed and sat on the edge of it. Something had to be done at once. He\ndid not know what it was but he felt that there could be no more sleep,\nno more rest, no dressing nor eating nor going forth before he came to\ndecisions. Christian before his pilgrimage began was not more certain of\nthis need of flight from the life of routine and vanities.\n\nWhat was to be done?\n\nIn the first place he must get away and think about it all, think\nhimself clear of all these--these immediacies, these associations and\nrelations and holds and habits. He must get back to his vision, get back\nto the God in his vision. And to do that he must go alone.\n\nHe was clear he must go alone. It was useless to go to Prothero, one\nweak man going to a weaker. Prothero he was convinced could help him not\nat all, and the strange thing is that this conviction had come to him\nand had established itself incontestably because of that figure at the\nstreet corner, which had for just one moment resembled Prothero. By some\nfantastic intuition Benham knew that Prothero would not only participate\nbut excuse. And he knew that he himself could endure no excuses. He\nmust cut clear of any possibility of qualification. This thing had to be\nstopped. He must get away, he must get free, he must get clean. In the\nextravagance of his reaction Benham felt that he could endure nothing\nbut solitary places and to sleep under the open sky.\n\nHe wanted to get right away from London and everybody and lie in the\nquiet darkness and stare up at the stars.\n\nHis plans grew so definite that presently he was in his dressing-gown\nand turning out the maps in the lower drawer of his study bureau. He\nwould go down into Surrey with a knapsack, wander along the North Downs\nuntil the Guildford gap was reached, strike across the Weald country to\nthe South Downs and then beat eastward. The very thought of it brought\na coolness to his mind. He knew that over those southern hills one could\nbe as lonely as in the wilderness and as free to talk to God. And there\nhe would settle something. He would make a plan for his life and end\nthis torment.\n\nWhen Merkle came in to him in the morning he was fast asleep.\n\nThe familiar curtain rings awakened Benham. He turned his head over,\nstared for a moment and then remembered.\n\n\"Merkle,\" he said, \"I am going for a walking tour. I am going off this\nmorning. Haven't I a rucksack?\"\n\n\"You 'ave a sort of canvas bag, sir, with pockets to it,\" said Merkle.\n\"Will you be needing the VERY 'eavy boots with 'obnails--Swiss, I fancy,\nsir--or your ordinary shooting boots?\"\n\n\"And when may I expect you back, sir?\" asked Merkle as the moment for\ndeparture drew near.\n\n\"God knows,\" said Benham, \"I don't.\"\n\n\"Then will there be any address for forwarding letters, sir?\"\n\nBenham hadn't thought of that. For a moment he regarded Merkle's\nscrupulous respect with a transient perplexity.\n\n\"I'll let you know, Merkle,\" he said. \"I'll let you know.\"\n\nFor some days at least, notes, telephone messages, engagements, all this\nfuss and clamour about nothing, should clamour for him in vain....\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\"But how closely,\" cried White, in a mood of cultivated enthusiasm; \"how\nclosely must all the poor little stories that we tell to-day follow\nin the footsteps of the Great Exemplars! A little while ago and the\nspringtime freshness of Tobias irradiated the page. Now see! it is\nChristian--.\"\n\nIndeed it looked extremely like Christian as Benham went up across the\nspringy turf from Epsom Downs station towards the crest of the hill.\nWas he not also fleeing in the morning sunlight from the City of\nDestruction? Was he not also seeking that better city whose name is\nPeace? And there was a bundle on his back. It was the bundle, I think,\nthat seized most firmly upon the too literary imagination of White.\n\nBut the analogy of the bundle was a superficial one. Benham had not\nthe slightest desire to lose it from his shoulders. It would have\ninconvenienced him very greatly if he had done so. It did not contain\nhis sins. Our sins nowadays are not so easily separated. It contained a\nlight, warm cape-coat he had bought in Switzerland and which he intended\nto wrap about him when he slept under the stars, and in addition\nMerkle had packed it with his silk pyjamas, an extra pair of stockings,\ntooth-brush, brush and comb, a safety razor.... And there were several\nsheets of the Ordnance map.\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nThe urgency of getting away from something dominated Benham to the\nexclusion of any thought of what he might be getting to. That muddle of\nhis London life had to be left behind. First, escape....\n\nOver the downs great numbers of larks were singing. It was warm April\nthat year and early. All the cloud stuff in the sky was gathered\ninto great towering slow-sailing masses, and the rest was blue of\nthe intensest. The air was so clean that Benham felt it clean in the\nsubstance of his body. The chestnuts down the hill to the right were\nflowering, the beeches were luminously green, and the oaks in the\nvalley foaming gold. And sometimes it was one lark filled his ears, and\nsometimes he seemed to be hearing all the larks for miles about him.\nPresently over the crest he would be out of sight of the grand stand and\nthe men exercising horses, and that brace of red-jacketed golfers....\n\nWhat was he to do?\n\nFor a time he could think of nothing to do except to keep up and out of\nthe valley. His whole being seemed to have come to his surfaces to look\nout at the budding of the year and hear the noise of the birds. And then\nhe got into a long road from which he had to escape, and trespassing\nsouthward through plantations he reached the steep edge of the hills\nand sat down over above a great chalk pit somewhere near Dorking and\nsurveyed all the tumbled wooded spaces of the Weald.... It is after all\nnot so great a country this Sussex, nor so hilly, from deepest valley to\nhighest crest is not six hundred feet, yet what a greatness of effect it\ncan achieve! There is something in those downland views which, like sea\nviews, lifts a mind out to the skies. All England it seemed was there to\nBenham's vision, and the purpose of the English, and his own purpose in\nthe world. For a long time he surveyed the large delicacy of the detail\nbefore him, the crests, the tree-protected houses, the fields and\nfarmsteads, the distant gleams of water. And then he became interested\nin the men who were working in the chalk pit down below.\n\nThey at any rate were not troubled with the problem of what to do with\ntheir lives.\n\n\n\n13\n\n\nBenham found his mind was now running clear, and so abundantly that he\ncould scarcely, he felt, keep pace with it. As he thought his flow of\nideas was tinged with a fear that he might forget what he was thinking.\nIn an instant, for the first time in his mental existence, he could have\nimagined he had discovered Labour and seen it plain. A little while ago\nand he had seemed a lonely man among the hills, but indeed he was not\nlonely, these men had been with him all the time, and he was free to\nwander, to sit here, to think and choose simply because those men down\nthere were not free. HE WAS SPENDING THEIR LEISURE.... Not once but\nmany times with Prothero had he used the phrase RICHESSE OBLIGE. Now\nhe remembered it. He began to remember a mass of ideas that had been\noverlaid and stifling within him. This was what Merkle and the club\nservants and the entertainments and engagements and his mother and\nthe artistic touts and the theatrical touts and the hunting and the\nelaboration of games and--Mrs. Skelmersdale and all that had clustered\nthickly round him in London had been hiding from him. Those men below\nthere had not been trusted to choose their work; they had been given it.\nAnd he had been trusted....\n\nAnd now to grapple with it! Now to get it clear! What work was he going\nto do? That settled, he would deal with his distractions readily enough.\nUntil that was settled he was lax and exposed to every passing breeze of\ninvitation.\n\n\"What work am I going to do? What work am I going to do?\" He repeated\nit.\n\nIt is the only question for the aristocrat. What amusement? That for\na footman on holiday. That for a silly child, for any creature that is\nkept or led or driven. That perhaps for a tired invalid, for a\ntoiler worked to a rag. But able-bodied amusement! The arms of Mrs.\nSkelmersdale were no worse than the solemn aimlessness of hunting, and\nan evening of dalliance not an atom more reprehensible than an evening\nof chatter. It was the waste of him that made the sin. His life in\nLondon had been of a piece together. It was well that his intrigue had\nset a light on it, put a point to it, given him this saving crisis of\nthe nerves. That, indeed, is the chief superiority of idle love-making\nover other more prevalent forms of idleness and self-indulgence; it\ndoes at least bear its proper label. It is reprehensible. It brings your\ncareless honour to the challenge of concealment and shabby evasions and\nlies....\n\nBut in this pellucid air things took their proper proportions again.\n\nAnd now what was he to do?\n\n\"Politics,\" he said aloud to the turf and the sky.\n\nIs there any other work for an aristocratic man?... Science? One\ncould admit science in that larger sense that sweeps in History, or\nPhilosophy. Beyond that whatever work there is is work for which men\nare paid. Art? Art is nothing aristocratic except when it is a means\nof scientific or philosophical expression. Art that does not argue nor\ndemonstrate nor discover is merely the craftsman's impudence.\n\nHe pulled up at this and reflected for a time with some distinguished\ninstances in his mind. They were so distinguished, so dignified, they\ntook their various arts with so admirable a gravity that the soul of\nthis young man recoiled from the verdicts to which his reasoning drove\nhim. \"It's not for me to judge them,\" he decided, \"except in relation\nto myself. For them there may be tremendous significances in Art. But\nif these do not appear to me, then so far as I am concerned they do not\nexist for me. They are not in my world. So far as they attempt to invade\nme and control my attitudes or my outlook, or to judge me in any way,\nthere is no question of their impudence. Impudence is the word for it.\nMy world is real. I want to be really aristocratic, really brave, really\npaying for the privilege of not being a driven worker. The things\nthe artist makes are like the things my private dream-artist makes,\nrelaxing, distracting. What can Art at its greatest be, pure Art that\nis, but a more splendid, more permanent, transmissible reverie! The very\nessence of what I am after is NOT to be an artist....\"\n\nAfter a large and serious movement through his mind he came back to\nScience, Philosophy or Politics as the sole three justifications for the\nusurpation of leisure.\n\nSo far as devotion to science went, he knew he had no specific aptitude\nfor any departmentalized subject, and equally he felt no natural call to\nphilosophy. He was left with politics....\n\n\"Or else, why shouldn't I go down there and pick up a shovel and set to\nwork? To make leisure for my betters....\"\n\nAnd now it was that he could take up the real trouble that more than\nanything else had been keeping him ineffective and the prey of every\nchance demand and temptation during the last ten months. He had not been\nable to get himself into politics, and the reason why he had not been\nable to do so was that he could not induce himself to fit in. Statecraft\nwas a remote and faded thing in the political life of the time; politics\nwas a choice of two sides in a game, and either side he found equally\nunattractive. Since he had come down from Cambridge the Tariff Reform\npeople had gone far to capture the Conservative party. There was little\nchance of a candidature for him without an adhesion to that. And\nhe could find nothing he could imagine himself working for in the\ndeclarations of the Tariff Reform people. He distrusted them, he\ndisliked them. They took all the light and pride out of imperialism,\nthey reduced it to a shabby conspiracy of the British and their colonies\nagainst foreign industrialism. They were violent for armaments and\nhostile to education. They could give him no assurance of any scheme of\ngrowth and unification, and no guarantees against the manifest dangers\nof economic disturbance and political corruption a tariff involves.\nImperialism without noble imaginations, it seemed to him, was simply\nnationalism with megalomania. It was swaggering, it was greed, it was\nGerman; its enthusiasm was forced, its nobility a vulgar lie. No. And\nwhen he turned to the opposite party he found little that was more\nattractive. They were prepared, it seemed, if they came into office, to\npull the legislature of the British Isles to pieces in obedience to the\nIrish demand for Home Rule, and they were totally unprepared with any\nscheme for doing this that had even a chance of success. In the twenty\nyears that had elapsed since Gladstone's hasty and disastrous essay in\npolitical surgery they had studied nothing, learnt nothing, produced no\nideas whatever in the matter. They had not had the time. They had just\nnegotiated, like the mere politicians they were, for the Nationalist\nvote. They seemed to hope that by a marvel God would pacify Ulster. Lord\nDunraven, Plunkett, were voices crying in the wilderness. The sides in\nthe party game would as soon have heeded a poet.... But unless Benham\nwas prepared to subscribe either to Home Rule or Tariff Reform there was\nno way whatever open to him into public life. He had had some decisive\nconversations. He had no illusions left upon that score....\n\nHere was the real barrier that had kept him inactive for ten months.\nHere was the problem he had to solve. This was how he had been left\nout of active things, a prey to distractions, excitements, idle\ntemptations--and Mrs. Skelmersdale.\n\nRunning away to shoot big game or explore wildernesses was no remedy.\nThat was just running away. Aristocrats do not run away. What of his\ndebt to those men down there in the quarry? What of his debt to the\nunseen men in the mines away in the north? What of his debt to the\nstokers on the liners, and to the clerks in the city? He reiterated the\ncardinal article of his creed: The aristocrat is a privileged man in\norder that he may be a public and political man.\n\nBut how is one to be a political man when one is not in politics?\n\nBenham frowned at the Weald. His ideas were running thin.\n\nHe might hammer at politics from the outside. And then again how? He\nwould make a list of all the things that he might do. For example he\nmight write. He rested one hand on his knee and lifted one finger and\nregarded it. COULD he write? There were one or two men who ran papers\nand seemed to have a sort of independent influence. Strachey, for\nexample, with his SPECTATOR; Maxse, with his NATIONAL REVIEW. But they\nwere grown up, they had formed their ideas. He had to learn first.\n\nHe lifted a second finger. How to learn? For it was learning that he had\nto do.\n\nWhen one comes down from Oxford or Cambridge one falls into the mistake\nof thinking that learning is over and action must begin. But until one\nperceives clearly just where one stands action is impossible.\n\nHow is one with no experience of affairs to get an experience of affairs\nwhen the door of affairs is closed to one by one's own convictions?\nOutside of affairs how can one escape being flimsy? How can one escape\nbecoming merely an intellectual like those wordy Fabians, those writers,\nposeurs, and sham publicists whose wrangles he had attended? And,\nmoreover, there is danger in the leisure of your intellectual. One\ncannot be always reading and thinking and discussing and inquiring....\nWOULD IT NOT BE BETTER AFTER ALL TO MAKE A CONCESSION, SWALLOW HOME RULE\nOR TARIFF REFORM, AND SO AT LEAST GET HIS HANDS ON THINGS?\n\nAnd then in a little while the party conflict would swallow him up?\n\nStill it would engage him, it would hold him. If, perhaps, he did not\nlet it swallow him up. If he worked with an eye open for opportunities\nof self-assertion....\n\nThe party game had not altogether swallowed \"Mr. Arthur.\"...\n\nBut every one is not a Balfour....\n\nHe reflected profoundly. On his left knee his left hand rested with\ntwo fingers held up. By some rapid mental alchemy these fingers had now\nbecome Home Rule and Tariff Reform. His right hand which had hitherto\ntaken no part in the controversy, had raised its index finger by\nimperceptible degrees. It had been raised almost subconsciously. And by\nstill obscurer processes this finger had become Mrs. Skelmersdale. He\nrecognized her sudden reappearance above the threshold of consciousness\nwith mild surprise. He had almost forgotten her share in these problems.\nHe had supposed her dismissed to an entirely subordinate position....\n\nThen he perceived that the workmen in the chalk pit far below had\nknocked off and were engaged upon their midday meal. He understood why\nhis mind was no longer moving forward with any alacrity.\n\nFood?\n\nThe question where he should eat arose abruptly and dismissed all other\nproblems from his mind. He unfolded a map. Here must be the chalk pit,\nhere was Dorking. That village was Brockham Green. Should he go down to\nDorking or this way over Box Hill to the little inn at Burford Bridge.\nHe would try the latter.\n\n\n\n14\n\n\nThe April sunset found our young man talking to himself for greater\nemphasis, and wandering along a turfy cart-track through a wilderness\nmysteriously planted with great bushes of rhododendra on the Downs above\nShere. He had eaten a belated lunch at Burford Bridge, he had got some\ntea at a little inn near a church with a splendid yew tree, and for the\nrest of the time he had wandered and thought. He had travelled perhaps a\ndozen or fifteen miles, and a good way from his first meditations above\nthe Dorking chalk pit.\n\nHe had recovered long ago from that remarkable conception of an active\nif dishonest political career as a means of escaping Mrs. Skelmersdale\nand all that Mrs. Skelmersdale symbolized. That would be just louting\nfrom one bad thing to another. He had to settle Mrs. Skelmersdale clean\nand right, and he had to do as exquisitely right in politics as he could\ndevise. If the public life of the country had got itself into a stupid\nantagonism of two undesirable things, the only course for a sane man of\nhonour was to stand out from the parties and try and get them back to\nsound issues again. There must be endless people of a mind with himself\nin this matter. And even if there were not, if he was the only man in\nthe world, he still had to follow his lights and do the right. And his\nbusiness was to find out the right....\n\nHe came back from these imaginative excursions into contemporary\npolitics with one idea confirmed in his mind, an idea that had been\nindeed already in his mind during his Cambridge days. This was the\nidea of working out for himself, thoroughly and completely, a political\nscheme, a theory of his work and duty in the world, a plan of the\nworld's future that should give a rule for his life. The Research\nMagnificent was emerging. It was an alarmingly vast proposal, but he\ncould see no alternative but submission, a plebeian's submission to the\ncurrents of life about him.\n\nLittle pictures began to flit before his imagination of the way in which\nhe might build up this tremendous inquiry. He would begin by hunting up\npeople, everybody who seemed to have ideas and promise ideas he would\nget at. He would travel far--and exhaustively. He would, so soon as\nthe ideas seemed to indicate it, hunt out facts. He would learn how the\nworld was governed. He would learn how it did its thinking. He would\nlive sparingly. (\"Not TOO sparingly,\" something interpolated.) He would\nwork ten or twelve hours a day. Such a course of investigation must\npass almost of its own accord into action and realization. He need not\ntrouble now how it would bring him into politics. Inevitably somewhere\nit would bring him into politics. And he would travel. Almost at once\nhe would travel. It is the manifest duty of every young aristocrat to\ntravel. Here he was, ruling India. At any rate, passively, through the\nmere fact of being English, he was ruling India. And he knew nothing of\nIndia. He knew nothing indeed of Asia. So soon as he returned to London\nhis preparations for this travel must begin, he must plot out the men to\nwhom he would go, and so contrive that also he would go round the world.\nPerhaps he would get Lionel Maxim to go with him. Or if Maxim could not\ncome, then possibly Prothero. Some one surely could be found, some one\nthinking and talking of statecraft and the larger idea of life. All the\nworld is not swallowed up in every day....\n\n\n\n15\n\n\nHis mind shifted very suddenly from these large proposals to an entirely\ndifferent theme. These mental landslips are not unusual when men are\nthinking hard and wandering. He found himself holding a trial upon\nhimself for Presumptuousness, for setting himself up against the wisdom\nof the ages, and the decisions of all the established men in the world,\nfor being in short a Presumptuous Sort of Ass. He was judge and jury\nand prosecutor, but rather inexplicably the defence was conducted in an\nirregular and undignified way by some inferior stratum of his being.\n\nAt first the defence contented itself with arguments that did at least\naim to rebut the indictment. The decisions of all the established men\nin the world were notoriously in conflict. However great was the gross\nwisdom of the ages the net wisdom was remarkably small. Was it after all\nso very immodest to believe that the Liberals were right in what they\nsaid about Tariff Reform, and the Tories right in their criticism of\nHome Rule?\n\nAnd then suddenly the defence threw aside its mask and insisted that\nBenham had to take this presumptuous line because there was no other\ntolerable line possible for him.\n\n\"Better die with the Excelsior chap up the mountains,\" the defence\ninterjected.\n\nThan what?\n\nConsider the quality Benham had already betrayed. He was manifestly\nincapable of a decent modest mediocre existence. Already he had ceased\nto be--if one may use so fine a word for genteel abstinence--virtuous.\nHe didn't ride well, he hadn't good hands, and he hadn't good hands for\nlife. He must go hard and harsh, high or low. He was a man who needed\nBITE in his life. He was exceptionally capable of boredom. He had been\nbored by London. Social occasions irritated him, several times he had\ncome near to gross incivilities, art annoyed him, sport was an effort,\nwholesome perhaps, but unattractive, music he loved, but it excited him.\nThe defendant broke the sunset calm by uttering amazing and improper\nphrases.\n\n\"I can't smug about in a state of falsified righteousness like these\nCrampton chaps.\n\n\"I shall roll in women. I shall rollick in women. If, that is, I stay in\nLondon with nothing more to do than I have had this year past.\n\n\"I've been sliding fast to it....\n\n\"NO! I'M DAMNED IF I DO!...\"\n\n\n\n16\n\n\nFor some time he had been bothered by a sense of something, something\nelse, awaiting his attention. Now it came swimming up into his\nconsciousness. He had forgotten. He was, of course, going to sleep out\nunder the stars.\n\nHe had settled that overnight, that was why he had this cloak in his\nrucksack, but he had settled none of the details. Now he must find some\nplace where he could lie down. Here, perhaps, in this strange forgotten\nwilderness of rhododendra.\n\nHe turned off from the track and wandered among the bushes. One might\nlie down anywhere here. But not yet; it was as yet barely twilight. He\nconsulted his watch. HALF-PAST SEVEN.\n\nNearly dinner-time....\n\nNo doubt Christian during the earlier stages of his pilgrimage noticed\nthe recurrence of the old familiar hours of his life of emptiness\nand vanity. Or rather of vanity--simply. Why drag in the thought of\nemptiness just at this point?...\n\nIt was very early to go to bed.\n\nHe might perhaps sit and think for a time. Here for example was a mossy\nbank, a seat, and presently a bed. So far there were only three stars\nvisible but more would come. He dropped into a reclining attitude. DAMP!\n\nWhen one thinks of sleeping out under the stars one is apt to forget the\ndew.\n\nHe spread his Swiss cloak out on the soft thick carpeting of herbs\nand moss, and arranged his knapsack as a pillow. Here he would lie and\nrecapitulate the thoughts of the day. (That squealing might be a\nyoung fox.) At the club at present men would be sitting about holding\nthemselves back from dinner. Excellent the clear soup always was at the\nclub! Then perhaps a Chateaubriand. That--what was that? Soft and large\nand quite near and noiseless. An owl!\n\nThe damp feeling was coming through his cloak. And this April night air\nhad a knife edge. Early ice coming down the Atlantic perhaps. It was\nwonderful to be here on the top of the round world and feel the icebergs\naway there. Or did this wind come from Russia? He wasn't quite clear\njust how he was oriented, he had turned about so much. Which was east?\nAnyhow it was an extremely cold wind.\n\nWhat had he been thinking? Suppose after all that ending with Mrs.\nSkelmersdale was simply a beginning. So far he had never looked sex in\nthe face....\n\nHe sat up and sneezed violently.\n\nIt would be ridiculous to start out seeking the clue to one's life and\nbe driven home by rheumatic fever. One should not therefore incur the\nrisk of rheumatic fever.\n\nSomething squealed in the bushes.\n\nIt was impossible to collect one's thoughts in this place. He stood up.\nThe night was going to be bitterly cold, savagely, cruelly cold....\n\nNo. There was no thinking to be done here, no thinking at all. He would\ngo on along the track and presently he would strike a road and so come\nto an inn. One can solve no problems when one is engaged in a struggle\nwith the elements. The thing to do now was to find that track again....\n\nIt took Benham two hours of stumbling and walking, with a little fence\nclimbing and some barbed wire thrown in, before he got down into Shere\nto the shelter of a friendly little inn. And then he negotiated a\nsatisfying meal, with beef-steak as its central fact, and stipulated for\na fire in his bedroom.\n\nThe landlord was a pleasant-faced man; he attended to Benham himself and\ndisplayed a fine sense of comfort. He could produce wine, a half-bottle\nof Australian hock, Big Tree brand No. 8, a virile wine, he thought of\nsardines to precede the meal, he provided a substantial Welsh rarebit\nby way of a savoury, he did not mind in the least that it was nearly ten\no'clock. He ended by suggesting coffee. \"And a liqueur?\"\n\nBenham had some Benedictine!\n\nOne could not slight such sympathetic helpfulness. The Benedictine was\ngenuine. And then came the coffee.\n\nThe cup of coffee was generously conceived and honestly made.\n\nA night of clear melancholy ensued....\n\n\n\n17\n\n\nHitherto Benham had not faced in any detail the problem of how to break\nwith Mrs. Skelmersdale. Now he faced it pessimistically. She would, he\nknew, be difficult to break with. (He ought never to have gone there\nto lunch.) There would be something ridiculous in breaking off. In all\nsorts of ways she might resist. And face to face with her he might\nfind himself a man divided against himself. That opened preposterous\npossibilities. On the other hand it was out of the question to do the\nbusiness by letter. A letter hits too hard; it lies too heavy on the\nwound it has made. And in money matters he could be generous. He must be\ngenerous. At least financial worries need not complicate her distresses\nof desertion. But to suggest such generosities on paper, in cold ink,\nwould be outrageous. And, in brief--he ought not to have gone there\nto lunch. After that he began composing letters at a great rate.\nDelicate--explanatory. Was it on the whole best to be explanatory?...\n\nIt was going to be a tremendous job, this breaking with her. And it had\nbegun so easily....\n\nThere was, he remembered with amazing vividness, a little hollow he had\nfound under her ear, and how when he kissed her there it always made her\nforget her worries and ethical problems for a time and turn to him....\n\n\"No,\" he said grimly, \"it must end,\" and rolled over and stared at the\nblack....\n\nLike an insidious pedlar, that old rascal whom young literary gentlemen\ncall the Great God Pan, began to spread his wares in the young man's\nmemory....\n\nAfter long and feverish wanderings of the mind, and some talking to\nhimself and walking about the room, he did at last get a little away\nfrom Mrs. Skelmersdale.\n\nHe perceived that when he came to tell his mother about this journey\naround the world there would be great difficulties. She would object\nvery strongly, and if that did not do then she would become extremely\nabusive, compare him to his father, cry bitterly, and banish him\nsuddenly and heartbrokenly from her presence for ever. She had done that\ntwice already--once about going to the opera instead of listening to\na lecture on Indian ethnology and once about a week-end in Kent.... He\nhated hurting his mother, and he was beginning to know now how easily\nshe was hurt. It is an abominable thing to hurt one's mother--whether\none has a justification or whether one hasn't.\n\nRecoiling from this, he was at once resumed by Mrs. Skelmersdale. Who\nhad in fact an effect of really never having been out of the room. But\nnow he became penitent about her. His penitence expanded until it was on\na nightmare scale. At last it blotted out the heavens. He felt like one\nof those unfortunate victims of religious mania who are convinced they\nhave committed the Sin against the Holy Ghost. (Why had he gone there\nto lunch? That was the key to it. WHY had he gone there to lunch?)... He\nbegan to have remorse for everything, for everything he had ever done,\nfor everything he had ever not done, for everything in the world. In a\nmoment of lucidity he even had remorse for drinking that stout honest\ncup of black coffee....\n\nAnd so on and so on and so on....\n\nWhen daylight came it found Benham still wide awake. Things crept\nmournfully out of the darkness into a reproachful clearness. The sound\nof birds that had been so delightful on the yesterday was now no longer\nagreeable. The thrushes, he thought, repeated themselves a great deal.\n\nHe fell asleep as it seemed only a few minutes before the landlord,\naccompanied by a great smell of frying bacon, came to call him.\n\n\n\n18\n\n\nThe second day opened rather dully for Benham. There was not an idea\nleft in his head about anything in the world. It was--SOLID. He walked\nthrough Bramley and Godalming and Witley and so came out upon the purple\nwaste of Hindhead. He strayed away from the road and found a sunny place\nof turf amidst the heather and lay down and slept for an hour or so. He\narose refreshed. He got some food at the Huts Inn on the Hindhead crest\nand went on across sunlit heathery wildernesses variegated by patches of\nspruce and fir and silver birch. And then suddenly his mental inanition\nwas at an end and his thoughts were wide and brave again. He was\nastonished that for a moment he could have forgotten that he was vowed\nto the splendid life.\n\n\"Continence by preoccupation;\" he tried the phrase....\n\n\"A man must not give in to fear; neither must he give in to sex. It's\nthe same thing really. The misleading of instinct.\"\n\nThis set the key of his thought throughout the afternoon--until Amanda\nhappened to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE THIRD ~~ AMANDA\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nAmanda happened to Benham very suddenly.\n\nFrom Haslemere he had gone on to further heaths and gorse beyond\nLiphook, and thence he had wandered into a pretty district beset\nwith Hartings. He had found himself upon a sandy ridge looking very\nbeautifully into a sudden steep valley that he learnt was Harting\nCoombe; he had been through a West Harting and a South Harting and read\nfinger-posts pointing to others of the clan; and in the evening, at\nthe foot of a steep hill where two roads met, he sat down to consider\nwhether he should go back and spend the night in one of the two\nkindly-looking inns of the latter place or push on over the South Downs\ntowards the unknown luck of Singleton or Chichester. As he sat down two\nbig retrievers, black and brown, came headlong down the road. The black\ncarried a stick, the brown disputed and pursued. As they came abreast of\nhim the foremost a little relaxed his hold, the pursuer grabbed at\nit, and in an instant the rivalry had flared to rage and a first-class\ndogfight was in progress.\n\nBenham detested dog-fights. He stood up, pale and distressed. \"Lie\ndown!\" he cried. \"Shut up, you brutes!\" and was at a loss for further\naction.\n\nThen it was Amanda leapt into his world, a light, tall figure of a girl,\nfluttering a short petticoat. Hatless she was, brown, flushed, and her\ndark hair tossing loose, and in a moment she had the snarling furious\ndogs apart, each gripped firmly by its collar. Then with a wriggle\nblack was loose and had closed again. Inspired by the best traditions of\nchivalry Benham came to her assistance. He was not expert with dogs. He\ngrasped the black dog under its ear. He was bitten in the wrist, rather\nin excitement than malice, and with a certain excess of zeal he was\nstrangling the brute before you could count ten.\n\nAmanda seized the fallen stick and whacked the dog she held, reasonably\nbut effectively until its yelps satisfied her. \"There!\" she said\npitching her victim from her, and stood erect again. She surveyed the\nproceedings of her helper for the first time.\n\n\"You needn't,\" she said, \"choke Sultan anymore.\"\n\n\"Ugh!\" she said, as though that was enough for Sultan. And peace was\nrestored.\n\n\"I'm obliged to you. But--... I say! He didn't bite you, did he? Oh,\nSULTAN!\"\n\nSultan tried to express his disgust at the affair. Rotten business.\nWhen a fellow is fighting one can't be meticulous. And if people come\ninterfering. Still--SORRY! So Sultan by his code of eye and tail.\n\n\"May I see?... Something ought to be done to this....\"\n\nShe took his wrist in her hand, and her cheek and eyelashes came within\na foot of his face.\n\nSome observant element in his composition guessed, and guessed quite\naccurately, that she was nineteen....\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nShe had an eyebrow like a quick stroke of a camel's-hair brush, she\nhad a glowing face, half childish imp, half woman, she had honest hazel\neyes, a voice all music, a manifest decision of character. And he must\nhave this bite seen to at once. She lived not five minutes away. He must\ncome with her.\n\nShe had an aunt who behaved like a mother and a mother who behaved like\na genteel visitor, and they both agreed with Amanda that although Mr.\nWalter Long and his dreadful muzzles and everything did seem to have\nstamped out rabies, yet you couldn't be too careful with a dog bite. A\ndog bite might be injurious in all sorts of ways--particularly\nSultan's bite. He was, they had to confess, a dog without refinement,\na coarse-minded omnivorous dog. Both the elder ladies insisted upon\nregarding Benham's wound as clear evidence of some gallant rescue of\nAmanda from imminent danger--\"she's always so RECKLESS with those dogs,\"\nas though Amanda was not manifestly capable of taking care of herself;\nand when he had been Listerined and bandaged, they would have it that he\nshould join them at their supper-dinner, which was already prepared and\nwaiting. They treated him as if he were still an undergraduate, they\ntook his arrangements in hand as though he was a favourite nephew. He\nmust stay in Harting that night. Both the Ship and the Coach and Horses\nwere excellent inns, and over the Downs there would be nothing for miles\nand miles....\n\nThe house was a little long house with a verandah and a garden in front\nof it with flint-edged paths; the room in which they sat and ate was\nlong and low and equipped with pieces of misfitting good furniture, an\naccidental-looking gilt tarnished mirror, and a sprinkling of old and\nmiddle-aged books. Some one had lit a fire, which cracked and spurted\nabout cheerfully in a motherly fireplace, and a lamp and some candles\ngot lit. Mrs. Wilder, Amanda's aunt, a comfortable dark broad-browed\nwoman, directed things, and sat at the end of the table and placed\nBenham on her right hand between herself and Amanda. Amanda's mother\nremained undeveloped, a watchful little woman with at least an eyebrow\nlike her daughter's. Her name, it seemed, was Morris. No servant\nappeared, but two cousins of a vague dark picturesqueness and with a\nstamp of thirty upon them, the first young women Benham had ever seen\ndressed in djibbahs, sat at the table or moved about and attended to the\nsimple needs of the service. The reconciled dogs were in the room and\nshifted inquiring noses from one human being to another.\n\nAmanda's people were so easy and intelligent and friendly, and\nBenham after his thirty hours of silence so freshly ready for human\nassociation, that in a very little while he could have imagined he had\nknown and trusted this household for years. He had never met such people\nbefore, and yet there was something about them that seemed familiar--and\nthen it occurred to him that something of their easy-going freedom was\nto be found in Russian novels. A photographic enlargement of somebody\nwith a vegetarian expression of face and a special kind of slouch hat\ngave the atmosphere a flavour of Socialism, and a press and tools and\nstamps and pigments on an oak table in the corner suggested some such\nsocialistic art as bookbinding. They were clearly 'advanced' people. And\nAmanda was tremendously important to them, she was their light, their\npride, their most living thing. They focussed on her. When he talked to\nthem all in general he talked to her in particular. He felt that some\nintroduction of himself was due to these welcoming people. He tried\nto give it mixed with an itinerary and a sketch of his experiences. He\npraised the heather country and Harting Coombe and the Hartings. He\ntold them that London had suddenly become intolerable--\"In the spring\nsunshine.\"\n\n\"You live in London?\" said Mrs. Wilder.\n\nYes. And he had wanted to think things out. In London one could do no\nthinking--\n\n\"Here we do nothing else,\" said Amanda.\n\n\"Except dog-fights,\" said the elder cousin.\n\n\"I thought I would just wander and think and sleep in the open air. Have\nyou ever tried to sleep in the open air?\"\n\n\"In the summer we all do,\" said the younger cousin. \"Amanda makes us. We\ngo out on to the little lawn at the back.\"\n\n\"You see Amanda has some friends at Limpsfield. And there they all go\nout and camp and sleep in the woods.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" reflected Mrs. Wilder, \"in April it must be different.\"\n\n\"It IS different,\" said Benham with feeling; \"the night comes five hours\ntoo soon. And it comes wet.\" He described his experiences and his flight\nto Shere and the kindly landlord and the cup of coffee. \"And after that\nI thought with a vengeance.\"\n\n\"Do you write things?\" asked Amanda abruptly, and it seemed to him with\na note of hope.\n\n\"No. No, it was just a private puzzle. It was something I couldn't get\nstraight.\"\n\n\"And you have got it straight?\" asked Amanda.\n\n\"I think so.\"\n\n\"You were making up your mind about something?\"\n\n\"Amanda DEAR!\" cried her mother.\n\n\"Oh! I don't mind telling you,\" said Benham.\n\nThey seemed such unusual people that he was moved to unusual\nconfidences. They had that effect one gets at times with strangers\nfreshly met as though they were not really in the world. And there was\nsomething about Amanda that made him want to explain himself to her\ncompletely.\n\n\"What I wanted to think about was what I should do with my life.\"\n\n\"Haven't you any WORK--?\" asked the elder cousin.\n\n\"None that I'm obliged to do.\"\n\n\"That's where a man has the advantage,\" said Amanda with the tone of\nprofound reflection. \"You can choose. And what are you going to do with\nyour life?\"\n\n\"Amanda,\" her mother protested, \"really you mustn't!\"\n\n\"I'm going round the world to think about it,\" Benham told her.\n\n\"I'd give my soul to travel,\" said Amanda.\n\nShe addressed her remark to the salad in front of her.\n\n\"But have you no ties?\" asked Mrs. Wilder.\n\n\"None that hold me,\" said Benham. \"I'm one of those unfortunates who\nneedn't do anything at all. I'm independent. You see my riddles. East\nand west and north and south, it's all my way for the taking. There's\nnot an indication.\"\n\n\"If I were you,\" said Amanda, and reflected. Then she half turned\nherself to him. \"I should go first to India,\" she said, \"and I should\nshoot, one, two, three, yes, three tigers. And then I would see\nFarukhabad Sikri--I was reading in a book about it yesterday--where the\njungle grows in the palaces; and then I would go right up the Himalayas,\nand then, then I would have a walking tour in Japan, and then I would\nsail in a sailing ship down to Borneo and Java and set myself up as a\nRanee--... And then I would think what I would do next.\"\n\n\"All alone, Amanda?\" asked Mrs. Wilder.\n\n\"Only when I shoot tigers. You and mother should certainly come to\nJapan.\"\n\n\"But Mr. Benham perhaps doesn't intend to shoot tigers, Amanda?\" said\nAmanda's mother.\n\n\"Not at once. My way will be a little different. I think I shall go\nfirst through Germany. And then down to Constantinople. And then I've\nsome idea of getting across Asia Minor and Persia to India. That would\ntake some time. One must ride.\"\n\n\"Asia Minor ought to be fun,\" said Amanda. \"But I should prefer India\nbecause of the tigers. It would be so jolly to begin with the tigers\nright away.\"\n\n\"It is the towns and governments and peoples I want to see rather than\ntigers,\" said Benham. \"Tigers if they are in the programme. But I want\nto find out about--other things.\"\n\n\"Don't you think there's something to be found out at home?\" said the\nelder cousin, blushing very brightly and speaking with the effort of one\nwho speaks for conscience' sake.\n\n\"Betty's a Socialist,\" Amanda said to Benham with a suspicion of\napology.\n\n\"Well, we're all rather that,\" Mrs. Wilder protested.\n\n\"If you are free, if you are independent, then don't you owe something\nto the workers?\" Betty went on, getting graver and redder with each\nword.\n\n\"It's just because of that,\" said Benham, \"that I am going round the\nworld.\"\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nHe was as free with these odd people as if he had been talking to\nProthero. They were--alert. And he had been alone and silent and full of\nthinking for two clear days. He tried to explain why he found Socialism\nat once obvious and inadequate....\n\nPresently the supper things got themselves put away and the talk moved\ninto a smaller room with several armchairs and a fire. Mrs. Wilder and\nthe cousins and Amanda each smoked a cigarette as if it were symbolical,\nand they were joined by a grave grey-bearded man with a hyphenated name\nand slightly Socratic manner, dressed in a very blue linen shirt\nand collar, a very woolly mustard-coloured suit and loose tie, and\nmanifestly devoted to one of those branches of exemplary domestic\ndecoration that grow upon Socialist soil in England. He joined Betty in\nthe opinion that the duty of a free and wealthy young man was to remain\nin England and give himself to democratic Socialism and the abolition\nof \"profiteering.\" \"Consider that chair,\" he said. But Benham had little\nfeeling for the craftsmanship of chairs.\n\nUnder cross-examination Mr. Rathbone-Sanders became entangled and\nprophetic. It was evident he had never thought out his \"democratic,\" he\nhad rested in some vague tangle of idealism from which Benham now set\nhimself with the zeal of a specialist to rout him. Such an argument\nsprang up as one meets with rarely beyond the happy undergraduate's\nrange. Everybody lived in the discussion, even Amanda's mother listened\nvisibly. Betty said she herself was certainly democratic and Mrs. Wilder\nhad always thought herself to be so, and outside the circle round the\nfire Amanda hovered impatiently, not quite sure of her side as yet, but\neager to come down with emphasis at the first flash of intimation.\n\nShe came down vehemently on Benham's.\n\nAnd being a very clear-cutting personality with an instinct for the\nmaterial rendering of things, she also came and sat beside him on the\nlittle square-cornered sofa.\n\n\"Of course, Mr. Rathbone-Sanders,\" she said, \"of course the world must\nbelong to the people who dare. Of course people aren't all alike, and\ndull people, as Mr. Benham says, and spiteful people, and narrow people\nhave no right to any voice at all in things....\"\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nIn saying this she did but echo Benham's very words, and all she\nsaid and did that evening was in quick response to Benham's earnest\nexpression of his views. She found Benham a delightful novelty. She\nliked to argue because there was no other talk so lively, and she had\nperhaps a lurking intellectual grudge against Mr. Rathbone-Sanders\nthat made her welcome an ally. Everything from her that night that even\nverges upon the notable has been told, and yet it sufficed, together\nwith something in the clear, long line of her limbs, in her voice,\nin her general physical quality, to convince Benham that she was the\nfreest, finest, bravest spirit that he had ever encountered.\n\nIn the papers he left behind him was to be found his perplexed\nendeavours to explain this mental leap, that after all his efforts still\nremained unexplained. He had been vividly impressed by the decision and\ncourage of her treatment of the dogs; it was just the sort of thing\nhe could not do. And there was a certain contagiousness in the petting\nadmiration with which her family treated her. But she was young and\nhealthy and so was he, and in a second mystery lies the key of the\nfirst. He had fallen in love with her, and that being so whatever he\nneeded that instantly she was. He needed a companion, clean and brave\nand understanding....\n\nIn his bed in the Ship that night he thought of nothing but her before\nhe went to sleep, and when next morning he walked on his way over\nthe South Downs to Chichester his mind was full of her image and of a\nhundred pleasant things about her. In his confessions he wrote, \"I felt\nthere was a sword in her spirit. I felt she was as clean as the wind.\"\n\nLove is the most chastening of powers, and he did not even remember now\nthat two days before he had told the wind and the twilight that he would\ncertainly \"roll and rollick in women\" unless there was work for him to\ndo. She had a peculiarly swift and easy stride that went with him in his\nthoughts along the turf by the wayside halfway and more to Chichester.\nHe thought always of the two of them as being side by side. His\nimagination became childishly romantic. The open down about him with its\nscrub of thorn and yew became the wilderness of the world, and through\nit they went--in armour, weightless armour--and they wore long swords.\nThere was a breeze blowing and larks were singing and something,\nsomething dark and tortuous dashed suddenly in headlong flight from\nbefore their feet. It was an ethical problem such as those Mrs.\nSkelmersdale nursed in her bosom. But at the sight of Amanda it had\nstraightened out--and fled....\n\nAnd interweaving with such imaginings, he was some day to record, there\nwere others. She had brought back to his memory the fancies that had\nbeen aroused in his first reading of Plato's REPUBLIC; she made him\nthink of those women Guardians, who were the friends and mates of men.\nHe wanted now to re-read that book and the LAWS. He could not remember\nif the Guardians were done in the LAWS as well as in the REPUBLIC. He\nwished he had both these books in his rucksack, but as he had not, he\ndecided he would hunt for them in Chichester. When would he see Amanda\nagain? He would ask his mother to make the acquaintance of these very\ninteresting people, but as they did not come to London very much it\nmight be some time before he had a chance of seeing her again.\nAnd, besides, he was going to America and India. The prospect of an\nexploration of the world was still noble and attractive; but he realized\nit would stand very much in the way of his seeing more of Amanda. Would\nit be a startling and unforgivable thing if presently he began to write\nto her? Girls of that age and spirit living in out-of-the-way villages\nhave been known to marry....\n\nMarriage didn't at this stage strike Benham as an agreeable aspect of\nAmanda's possibilities; it was an inconvenience; his mind was running\nin the direction of pedestrian tours in armour of no particular weight,\namidst scenery of a romantic wildness....\n\nWhen he had gone to the house and taken his leave that morning it had\nseemed quite in the vein of the establishment that he should be received\nby Amanda alone and taken up the long garden before anybody else\nappeared, to see the daffodils and the early apple-trees in blossom and\nthe pear-trees white and delicious.\n\nThen he had taken his leave of them all and made his social tentatives.\nDid they ever come to London? When they did they must let his people\nknow. He would so like them to know his mother, Lady Marayne. And so on\nwith much gratitude.\n\nAmanda had said that she and the dogs would come with him up the hill,\nshe had said it exactly as a boy might have said it, she had brought him\nup to the corner of Up Park and had sat down there on a heap of stones\nand watched him until he was out of sight, waving to him when he looked\nback. \"Come back again,\" she had cried.\n\nIn Chichester he found a little green-bound REPUBLIC in a second-hand\nbook-shop near the Cathedral, but there was no copy of the LAWS to\nbe found in the place. Then he was taken with the brilliant idea of\nsleeping the night in Chichester and going back next day via Harting to\nPetersfield station and London. He carried out this scheme and got to\nSouth Harting neatly about four o'clock in the afternoon. He found\nMrs. Wilder and Mrs. Morris and Amanda and the dogs entertaining Mr.\nRathbone-Sanders at tea, and they all seemed a little surprised, and,\nexcept Mr. Rathbone-Sanders, they all seemed pleased to see him again\nso soon. His explanation of why he hadn't gone back to London from\nChichester struck him as a little unconvincing in the cold light of Mr.\nRathbone-Sanders' eye. But Amanda was manifestly excited by his return,\nand he told them his impressions of Chichester and described the\nentertainment of the evening guest at a country inn and suddenly\nproduced his copy of the REPUBLIC. \"I found this in a book-shop,\" he\nsaid, \"and I brought it for you, because it describes one of the best\ndreams of aristocracy there has ever been dreamt.\"\n\nAt first she praised it as a pretty book in the dearest little binding,\nand then realized that there were deeper implications, and became\ngrave and said she would read it through and through, she loved such\nspeculative reading.\n\nShe came to the door with the others and stayed at the door after they\nhad gone in again. When he looked back at the corner of the road to\nPetersfield she was still at the door and waved farewell to him.\n\nHe only saw a light slender figure, but when she came back into the\nsitting-room Mr. Rathbone-Sanders noted the faint flush in her cheek and\nan unwonted abstraction in her eye.\n\nAnd in the evening she tucked her feet up in the armchair by the lamp\nand read the REPUBLIC very intently and very thoughtfully, occasionally\nturning over a page.\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nWhen Benham got back to London he experienced an unwonted desire to\nperform his social obligations to the utmost.\n\nSo soon as he had had some dinner at his club he wrote his South Harting\nfriends a most agreeable letter of thanks for their kindness to him. In\na little while he hoped he should see them again. His mother, too, was\nmost desirous to meet them.... That done, he went on to his flat and to\nvarious aspects of life for which he was quite unprepared.\n\nBut here we may note that Amanda answered him. Her reply came some four\ndays later. It was written in a square schoolgirl hand, it covered\nthree sheets of notepaper, and it was a very intelligent essay upon the\nREPUBLIC of Plato. \"Of course,\" she wrote, \"the Guardians are inhuman,\nbut it was a glorious sort of inhumanity. They had a spirit--like sharp\nknives cutting through life.\"\n\nIt was her best bit of phrasing and it pleased Benham very much.\nBut, indeed, it was not her own phrasing, she had culled it from a\ndisquisition into which she had led Mr. Rathbone-Sanders, and she had\nsent it to Benham as she might have sent him a flower.\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nBenham re-entered the flat from which he had fled so precipitately with\nthree very definite plans in his mind. The first was to set out upon\nhis grand tour of the world with as little delay as possible, to shut\nup this Finacue Street establishment for a long time, and get rid of\nthe soul-destroying perfections of Merkle. The second was to end his\nill-advised intimacy with little Mrs. Skelmersdale as generously and\ncheerfully as possible. The third was to bring Lady Marayne into social\nrelations with the Wilder and Morris MENAGE at South Harting. It did not\nstrike him that there was any incompatibility among these projects or\nany insurmountable difficulty in any of them until he was back in his\nflat.\n\nThe accumulation of letters, packages and telephone memoranda upon his\ndesk included a number of notes and slips to remind him that both Mrs.\nSkelmersdale and his mother were ladies of some determination. Even as\nhe stood turning over the pile of documents the mechanical vehemence of\nthe telephone filled him with a restored sense of the adverse will in\nthings. \"Yes, mam,\" he heard Merkle's voice, \"yes, mam. I will tell\nhim, mam. Will you keep possession, mam.\" And then in the doorway of the\nstudy, \"Mrs. Skelmersdale, sir. Upon the telephone, sir.\"\n\nBenham reflected with various notes in his hand. Then he went to the\ntelephone.\n\n\"You Wicked Boy, where have you been hiding?\"\n\n\"I've been away. I may have to go away again.\"\n\n\"Not before you have seen me. Come round and tell me all about it.\"\n\nBenham lied about an engagement.\n\n\"Then to-morrow in the morning.\"... Impossible.\n\n\"In the afternoon. You don't WANT to see me.\" Benham did want to see\nher.\n\n\"Come round and have a jolly little evening to-morrow night. I've got\nsome more of that harpsichord music. And I'm dying to see you. Don't you\nunderstand?\"\n\nFurther lies. \"Look here,\" said Benham, \"can you come and have a talk\nin Kensington Gardens? You know the place, near that Chinese garden.\nPaddington Gate....\"\n\nThe lady's voice fell to flatness. She agreed. \"But why not come to see\nme HERE?\" she asked.\n\nBenham hung up the receiver abruptly.\n\nHe walked slowly back to his study. \"Phew!\" he whispered to himself.\nIt was like hitting her in the face. He didn't want to be a brute,\nbut short of being a brute there was no way out for him from this\nentanglement. Why, oh! why the devil had he gone there to lunch?...\n\nHe resumed his examination of the waiting letters with a ruffled mind.\nThe most urgent thing about them was the clear evidence of gathering\nanger on the part of his mother. He had missed a lunch party at Sir\nGodfrey's on Tuesday and a dinner engagement at Philip Magnet's, quite\nan important dinner in its way, with various promising young Liberals,\non Wednesday evening. And she was furious at \"this stupid mystery.\nOf course you're bound to be found out, and of course there will be a\nscandal.\"... He perceived that this last note was written on his own\npaper. \"Merkle!\" he cried sharply.\n\n\"Yessir!\"\n\nMerkle had been just outside, on call.\n\n\"Did my mother write any of these notes here?\" he asked.\n\n\"Two, sir. Her ladyship was round here three times, sir.\"\n\n\"Did she see all these letters?\"\n\n\"Not the telephone calls, sir. I 'ad put them on one side. But.... It's\na little thing, sir.\"\n\nHe paused and came a step nearer. \"You see, sir,\" he explained with the\nfaintest flavour of the confidential softening his mechanical respect,\n\"yesterday, when 'er ladyship was 'ere, sir, some one rang up on the\ntelephone--\"\n\n\"But you, Merkle--\"\n\n\"Exactly, sir. But 'er ladyship said 'I'LL go to that, Merkle,' and just\nfor a moment I couldn't exactly think 'ow I could manage it, sir, and\nthere 'er ladyship was, at the telephone. What passed, sir, I couldn't\n'ear. I 'eard her say, 'Any message?' And I FANCY, sir, I 'eard 'er say,\n'I'm the 'ousemaid,' but that, sir, I think must have been a mistake,\nsir.\"\n\n\"Must have been,\" said Benham. \"Certainly--must have been. And the call\nyou think came from--?\"\n\n\"There again, sir, I'm quite in the dark. But of course, sir, it's\nusually Mrs. Skelmersdale, sir. Just about her time in the afternoon. On\nan average, sir....\"\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\"I went out of London to think about my life.\"\n\nIt was manifest that Lady Marayne did not believe him.\n\n\"Alone?\" she asked.\n\n\"Of course alone.\"\n\n\"STUFF!\" said Lady Marayne.\n\nShe had taken him into her own little sitting-room, she had thrown aside\ngloves and fan and theatre wrap, curled herself comfortably into the\nabundantly cushioned corner by the fire, and proceeded to a mixture of\ncross-examination and tirade that he found it difficult to make head\nagainst. She was vibrating between distressed solicitude and resentful\nanger. She was infuriated at his going away and deeply concerned at\nwhat could have taken him away. \"I was worried,\" he said. \"London is too\ncrowded to think in. I wanted to get myself alone.\"\n\n\"And there I was while you were getting yourself alone, as you call it,\nwearing my poor little brains out to think of some story to tell people.\nI had to stuff them up you had a sprained knee at Chexington, and for\nall I knew any of them might have been seeing you that morning. Besides\nwhat has a boy like you to worry about? It's all nonsense, Poff.\"\n\nShe awaited his explanations. Benham looked for a moment like his\nfather.\n\n\"I'm not getting on, mother,\" he said. \"I'm scattering myself. I'm\ngetting no grip. I want to get a better hold upon life, or else I do not\nsee what is to keep me from going to pieces--and wasting existence. It's\nrather difficult sometimes to tell what one thinks and feels--\"\n\nShe had not really listened to him.\n\n\"Who is that woman,\" she interrupted suddenly, \"Mrs. Fly-by-Night, or\nsome such name, who rings you up on the telephone?\"\n\nBenham hesitated, blushed, and regretted it.\n\n\"Mrs. Skelmersdale,\" he said after a little pause.\n\n\"It's all the same. Who is she?\"\n\n\"She's a woman I met at a studio somewhere, and I went with her to one\nof those Dolmetsch concerts.\"\n\nHe stopped.\n\nLady Marayne considered him in silence for a little while. \"All men,\"\nshe said at last, \"are alike. Husbands, sons and brothers, they are all\nalike. Sons! One expects them to be different. They aren't different.\nWhy should they be? I suppose I ought to be shocked, Poff. But I'm not.\nShe seems to be very fond of you.\"\n\n\"She's--she's very good--in her way. She's had a difficult life....\"\n\n\"You can't leave a man about for a moment,\" Lady Marayne reflected.\n\"Poff, I wish you'd fetch me a glass of water.\"\n\nWhen he returned she was looking very fixedly into the fire. \"Put it\ndown,\" she said, \"anywhere. Poff! is this Mrs. Helter-Skelter a discreet\nsort of woman? Do you like her?\" She asked a few additional particulars\nand Benham made his grudging admission of facts. \"What I still don't\nunderstand, Poff, is why you have been away.\"\n\n\"I went away,\" said Benham, \"because I want to clear things up.\"\n\n\"But why? Is there some one else?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You went alone? All the time?\"\n\n\"I've told you I went alone. Do you think I tell you lies, mother?\"\n\n\"Everybody tells lies somehow,\" said Lady Marayne. \"Easy lies or stiff\nones. Don't FLOURISH, Poff. Don't start saying things like a moral\nwindmill in a whirlwind. It's all a muddle. I suppose every one in\nLondon is getting in or out of these entanglements--or something of\nthe sort. And this seems a comparatively slight one. I wish it hadn't\nhappened. They do happen.\"\n\nAn expression of perplexity came into her face. She looked at him. \"Why\ndo you want to throw her over?\"\n\n\"I WANT to throw her over,\" said Benham.\n\nHe stood up and went to the hearthrug, and his mother reflected that\nthis was exactly what all men did at just this phase of a discussion.\nThen things ceased to be sensible.\n\nFrom overhead he said to her: \"I want to get away from this\ncomplication, this servitude. I want to do some--some work. I want to\nget my mind clear and my hands clear. I want to study government and the\nbig business of the world.\"\n\n\"And she's in the way?\"\n\nHe assented.\n\n\"You men!\" said Lady Marayne after a little pause. \"What queer beasts\nyou are! Here is a woman who is kind to you. She's fond of you. I could\ntell she's fond of you directly I heard her. And you amuse yourself with\nher. And then it's Gobble, Gobble, Gobble, Great Work, Hands Clear, Big\nBusiness of the World. Why couldn't you think of that before, Poff? Why\ndid you begin with her?\"\n\n\"It was unexpected....\"\n\n\"STUFF!\" said Lady Marayne for a second time. \"Well,\" she said, \"well.\nYour Mrs. Fly-by-Night,--oh it doesn't matter!--whatever she calls\nherself, must look after herself. I can't do anything for her. I'm not\nsupposed even to know about her. I daresay she'll find her consolations.\nI suppose you want to go out of London and get away from it all. I can\nhelp you there, perhaps. I'm tired of London too. It's been a tiresome\nseason. Oh! tiresome and disappointing! I want to go over to Ireland and\ntravel about a little. The Pothercareys want us to come. They've asked\nus twice....\"\n\nBenham braced himself to face fresh difficulties. It was amazing how\ndifferent the world could look from his mother's little parlour and from\nthe crest of the North Downs.\n\n\"But I want to start round the world,\" he cried with a note of acute\ndistress. \"I want to go to Egypt and India and see what is happening in\nthe East, all this wonderful waking up of the East, I know nothing of\nthe way the world is going--...\"\n\n\"India!\" cried Lady Marayne. \"The East. Poff, what is the MATTER with\nyou? Has something happened--something else? Have you been having a love\naffair?--a REAL love affair?\"\n\n\"Oh, DAMN love affairs!\" cried Benham. \"Mother!--I'm sorry, mother! But\ndon't you see there's other things in the world for a man than having\na good time and making love. I'm for something else than that. You've\ngiven me the splendidest time--...\"\n\n\"I see,\" cried Lady Marayne, \"I see. I've bored you. I might have known\nI should have bored you.\"\n\n\"You've NOT bored me!\" cried Benham.\n\nHe threw himself on the rug at her feet. \"Oh, mother!\" he said, \"little,\ndear, gallant mother, don't make life too hard for me. I've got to do my\njob, I've got to find my job.\"\n\n\"I've bored you,\" she wept.\n\nSuddenly she was weeping with all the unconcealed distressing grief of\na disappointed child. She put her pretty be-ringed little hands in front\nof her face and recited the accumulation of her woes.\n\n\"I've done all I can for you, planned for you, given all my time for you\nand I've BORED you.\"\n\n\"Mother!\"\n\n\"Don't come near me, Poff! Don't TOUCH me! All my plans. All my\nambitions. Friends--every one. You don't know all I've given up for\nyou....\"\n\nHe had never seen his mother weep before. Her self-abandonment amazed\nhim. Her words were distorted by her tears. It was the most terrible and\ndistressing of crises....\n\n\"Go away from me! How can you help me? All I've done has been a failure!\nFailure! Failure!\"\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nThat night the silences of Finacue Street heard Benham's voice again. \"I\nmust do my job,\" he was repeating, \"I must do my job. Anyhow....\"\n\nAnd then after a long pause, like a watchword and just a little\nunsurely: \"Aristocracy....\"\n\nThe next day his resolution had to bear the brunt of a second ordeal.\nMrs. Skelmersdale behaved beautifully and this made everything\ntormentingly touching and difficult. She convinced him she was really\nin love with him, and indeed if he could have seen his freshness and\nsimplicity through her experienced eyes he would have known there was\nsound reason why she should have found him exceptional. And when his\nclumsy hints of compensation could no longer be ignored she treated him\nwith a soft indignation, a tender resentment, that left him soft and\ntender. She looked at him with pained eyes and a quiver of the lips.\nWhat did he think she was? And then a little less credibly, did he think\nshe would have given herself to him if she hadn't been in love with him?\nPerhaps that was not altogether true, but at any rate it was altogether\ntrue to her when she said it, and it was manifest that she did not for\na moment intend him to have the cheap consolation of giving her money.\nBut, and that seemed odd to Benham, she would not believe, just as Lady\nMarayne would not believe, that there was not some other woman in the\ncase. He assured her and she seemed reassured, and then presently she\nwas back at exactly the same question. Would no woman ever understand\nthe call of Asia, the pride of duty, the desire for the world?\n\nOne sort of woman perhaps....\n\nIt was odd that for the first time now, in the sunshine of Kensington\nGardens, he saw the little gossamer lines that tell that thirty years\nand more have passed over a face, a little wrinkling of the eyelids, a\nlittle hardening of the mouth. How slight it is, how invisible it\nhas been, how suddenly it appears! And the sunshine of the warm April\nafternoon, heightened it may be by her determined unmercenary pose,\nbetrayed too the faintest hint of shabbiness in her dress. He had never\nnoticed these shadows upon her or her setting before and their effect\nwas to fill him with a strange regretful tenderness....\n\nPerhaps men only begin to love when they cease to be dazzled and admire.\nHe had thought she might reproach him, he had felt and feared she might\nset herself to stir his senses, and both these expectations had been\nunjust to her he saw, now that he saw her beside him, a brave, rather\nill-advised and unlucky little struggler, stung and shamed. He forgot\nthe particulars of that first lunch of theirs together and he remembered\nhis mother's second contemptuous \"STUFF!\"\n\nIndeed he knew now it had not been unexpected. Why hadn't he left this\nlittle sensitive soul and this little sensitive body alone? And since\nhe hadn't done so, what right had he now to back out of their common\nadventure? He felt a sudden wild impulse to marry Mrs. Skelmersdale, in\na mood between remorse and love and self-immolation, and then a sunlit\nyoung woman with a leaping stride in her paces, passed across his\nheavens, pointing to Asia and Utopia and forbidding even another thought\nof the banns....\n\n\"You will kiss me good-bye, dear, won't you?\" said Mrs. Skelmersdale,\nbrimming over. \"You will do that.\"\n\nHe couldn't keep his arm from her little shoulders. And as their lips\ntouched he suddenly found himself weeping also....\n\nHis spirit went limping from that interview. She chose to stay behind\nin her chair and think, she said, and each time he turned back she was\nsitting in the same attitude looking at him as he receded, and she had\none hand on the chair back and her arm drawn up to it. The third time he\nwaved his hat clumsily, and she started and then answered with her hand.\nThen the trees hid her....\n\nThis sex business was a damnable business. If only because it made one\nhurt women....\n\nHe had trampled on Mrs. Skelmersdale, he had hurt and disappointed\nhis mother. Was he a brute? Was he a cold-blooded prig? What was this\naristocracy? Was his belief anything more than a theory? Was he only\ndreaming of a debt to the men in the quarry, to the miners, to the men\nin the stokeholes, to the drudges on the fields? And while he dreamt he\nwounded and distressed real living creatures in the sleep-walk of his\ndreaming....\n\nSo long as he stuck to his dream he must at any rate set his face\nabsolutely against the establishment of any further relations with\nwomen.\n\nUnless they were women of an entirely different type, women hardened and\ntempered, who would understand.\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nSo Benham was able to convert the unfortunate Mrs. Skelmersdale into a\ntender but for a long time an entirely painful memory. But mothers are\nnot so easily disposed of, and more particularly a mother whose conduct\nis coloured deeply by an extraordinary persuasion of having paid for her\noffspring twice over. Nolan was inexplicable; he was, Benham understood\nquite clearly, never to be mentioned again; but somehow from the past\nhis shadow and his legacy cast a peculiar and perplexing shadow of\nundefined obligation upon Benham's outlook. His resolution to go round\nthe world carried on his preparations rapidly and steadily, but at the\nsame time his mother's thwarted and angry bearing produced a torture\nof remorse in him. It was constantly in his mind, like the suit of the\nimportunate widow, that he ought to devote his life to the little lady's\nhappiness and pride, and his reason told him that even if he wanted to\nmake this sacrifice he couldn't; the mere act of making it would produce\nso entirely catastrophic a revulsion. He could as soon have become a\ncroquet champion or the curate of Chexington church, lines of endeavour\nwhich for him would have led straightly and simply to sacrilegious\nscandal or manslaughter with a mallet.\n\nThere is so little measure in the wild atonements of the young that it\nwas perhaps as well for the Research Magnificent that the remorses of\nthis period of Benham's life were too complicated and scattered for a\ncumulative effect. In the background of his mind and less subdued\nthan its importance could seem to warrant was his promise to bring the\nWilder-Morris people into relations with Lady Marayne. They had been so\ndelightful to him that he felt quite acutely the slight he was putting\nupon them by this delay. Lady Marayne's moods, however, had been so\nuncertain that he had found no occasion to broach this trifling matter,\nand when at last the occasion came he perceived in the same instant the\nfullest reasons for regretting it.\n\n\"Ah!\" she said, hanging only for a moment, and then: \"you told me you\nwere alone!\"...\n\nHer mind leapt at once to the personification of these people as all\nthat had puzzled and baffled her in her son since his flight from\nLondon. They were the enemy, they had got hold of him.\n\n\"When I asked you if you were alone you pretended to be angry,\" she\nremembered with a flash. \"You said, 'Do I tell lies?'\"\n\n\"I WAS alone. Until-- It was an accident. On my walk I was alone.\"\n\nBut he flinched before her accusing, her almost triumphant, forefinger.\n\nFrom the instant she heard of them she hated these South Harting people\nunrestrainedly. She made no attempt to conceal it. Her valiant bantam\nspirit caught at this quarrel as a refuge from the rare and uncongenial\nache of his secession. \"And who are they? What are they? What sort of\npeople can they be to drag in a passing young man? I suppose this girl\nof theirs goes out every evening--Was she painted, Poff?\"\n\nShe whipped him with her questions as though she was slashing his face.\nHe became dead-white and grimly civil, answering every question as\nthough it was the sanest, most justifiable inquiry.\n\n\"Of course I don't know who they are. How should I know? What need is\nthere to know?\"\n\n\"There are ways of finding out,\" she insisted. \"If I am to go down and\nmake myself pleasant to these people because of you.\"\n\n\"But I implore you not to.\"\n\n\"And five minutes ago you were imploring me to! Of course I shall.\"\n\n\"Oh well!--well!\"\n\n\"One has to know SOMETHING of the people to whom one commits oneself,\nsurely.\"\n\n\"They are decent people; they are well-behaved people.\"\n\n\"Oh!--I'll behave well. Don't think I'll disgrace your casual\nacquaintances. But who they are, what they are, I WILL know....\"\n\nOn that point Lady Marayne was to score beyond her utmost expectations.\n\n\"Come round,\" she said over the telephone, two mornings later. \"I've\nsomething to tell you.\"\n\nShe was so triumphant that she was sorry for him. When it came to\ntelling him, she failed from her fierceness.\n\n\"Poff, my little son,\" she said, \"I'm so sorry I hardly know how to tell\nyou. Poff, I'm sorry. I have to tell you--and it's utterly beastly.\"\n\n\"But what?\" he asked.\n\n\"These people are dreadful people.\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"You've heard of the great Kent and Eastern Bank smash and the\nMarlborough Building Society frauds eight or nine years ago?\"\n\n\"Vaguely. But what has that to do with them?\"\n\n\"That man Morris.\"\n\nShe stopped short, and Benham nodded for her to go on.\n\n\"Her father,\" said Lady Marayne.\n\n\"But who was Morris? Really, mother, I don't remember.\"\n\n\"He was sentenced to seven years--ten years--I forget. He had done all\nsorts of dreadful things. He was a swindler. And when he went out of the\ndock into the waiting-room-- He had a signet ring with prussic acid in\nit--...\"\n\n\"I remember now,\" he said.\n\nA silence fell between them.\n\nBenham stood quite motionless on the hearthrug and stared very hard at\nthe little volume of Henley's poetry that lay upon the table.\n\nHe cleared his throat presently.\n\n\"You can't go and see them then,\" he said. \"After all--since I am going\nabroad so soon--... It doesn't so very much matter.\"\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nTo Benham it did not seem to be of the slightest importance that\nAmanda's father was a convicted swindler who had committed suicide.\nNever was a resolved and conscious aristocrat so free from the\nhereditary delusion. Good parents, he was convinced, are only an\nadvantage in so far as they have made you good stuff, and bad parents\nare no discredit to a son or daughter of good quality. Conceivably he\nhad a bias against too close an examination of origins, and he held that\nthe honour of the children should atone for the sins of the fathers and\nthe questionable achievements of any intervening testator. Not half a\ndozen rich and established families in all England could stand even the\nmost conventional inquiry into the foundations of their pride, and\nonly a universal amnesty could prevent ridiculous distinctions. But he\nbrought no accusation of inconsistency against his mother. She looked at\nthings with a lighter logic and a kind of genius for the acceptance\nof superficial values. She was condoned and forgiven, a rescued lamb,\nre-established, notoriously bright and nice, and the Morrises were\ndamned. That was their status, exclusion, damnation, as fixed as colour\nin Georgia or caste in Bengal. But if his mother's mind worked in that\nway there was no reason why his should. So far as he was concerned, he\ntold himself, it did not matter whether Amanda was the daughter of a\nswindler or the daughter of a god. He had no doubt that she herself had\nthe spirit and quality of divinity. He had seen it.\n\nSo there was nothing for it in the failure of his mother's civilities\nbut to increase his own. He would go down to Harting and take his leave\nof these amiable outcasts himself. With a certain effusion. He would do\nthis soon because he was now within sight of the beginning of his world\ntour. He had made his plans and prepared most of his equipment. Little\nremained to do but the release of Merkle, the wrappering and locking up\nof Finacue Street, which could await him indefinitely, and the buying of\ntickets. He decided to take the opportunity afforded by a visit of Sir\nGodfrey and Lady Marayne to the Blights, big iron people in the North of\nEngland of so austere a morality that even Benham was ignored by it. He\nannounced his invasion in a little note to Mrs. Wilder. He parted from\nhis mother on Friday afternoon; she was already, he perceived, a little\nreconciled to his project of going abroad; and contrived his arrival\nat South Harting for that sunset hour which was for his imagination the\nnatural halo of Amanda.\n\n\"I'm going round the world,\" he told them simply. \"I may be away for\ntwo years, and I thought I would like to see you all again before I\nstarted.\"\n\nThat was quite the way they did things.\n\nThe supper-party included Mr. Rathbone-Sanders, who displayed a curious\ntendency to drift in between Benham and Amanda, a literary youth with\na Byronic visage, very dark curly hair, and a number of extraordinarily\nmature chins, a girl-friend of Betty's who had cycled down from London,\nand who it appeared maintained herself at large in London by drawing for\nadvertisements, and a silent colourless friend of Mr. Rathbone-Sanders.\nThe talk lit by Amanda's enthusiasm circled actively round Benham's\nexpedition. It was clear that the idea of giving some years to thinking\nout one's possible work in the world was for some reason that remained\nobscure highly irritating to both Mr. Rathbone-Sanders and the Byronic\nyouth. Betty too regarded it as levity when there was \"so much to be\ndone,\" and the topic whacked about and rose to something like a\nwrangle, and sat down and rested and got up again reinvigorated, with\na continuity of interest that Benham had never yet encountered in any\nLondon gathering. He made a good case for his modern version of the\nGrand Tour, and he gave them something of his intellectual enthusiasm\nfor the distances and views, the cities and seas, the multitudinous wide\nspectacle of the world he was to experience. He had been reading about\nBenares and North China. As he talked Amanda, who had been animated at\nfirst, fell thoughtful and silent. And then it was discovered that the\nnight was wonderfully warm and the moon shining. They drifted out into\nthe garden, but Mr. Rathbone-Sanders was suddenly entangled and drawn\nback by Mrs. Wilder and the young woman from London upon some technical\npoint, and taken to the work-table in the corner of the dining-room to\nexplain. He was never able to get to the garden.\n\nBenham found himself with Amanda upon a side path, a little isolated by\nsome swaggering artichokes and a couple of apple trees and so forth from\nthe general conversation. They cut themselves off from the continuation\nof that by a little silence, and then she spoke abruptly and with the\nquickness of a speaker who has thought out something to say and fears\ninterruption: \"Why did you come down here?\"\n\n\"I wanted to see you before I went.\"\n\n\"You disturb me. You fill me with envy.\"\n\n\"I didn't think of that. I wanted to see you again.\"\n\n\"And then you will go off round the world, you will see the Tropics, you\nwill see India, you will go into Chinese cities all hung with vermilion,\nyou will climb mountains. Oh! men can do all the splendid things. Why do\nyou come here to remind me of it? I have never been anywhere, anywhere\nat all. I never shall go anywhere. Never in my life have I seen a\nmountain. Those Downs there--look at them!--are my highest. And while\nyou are travelling I shall think of you--and think of you....\"\n\n\"Would YOU like to travel?\" he asked as though that was an extraordinary\nidea.\n\n\"Do you think EVERY girl wants to sit at home and rock a cradle?\"\n\n\"I never thought YOU did.\"\n\n\"Then what did you think I wanted?\"\n\n\"What DO you want?\"\n\nShe held her arms out widely, and the moonlight shone in her eyes as she\nturned her face to him.\n\n\"Just what you want,\" she said; \"--THE WHOLE WORLD!\n\n\"Life is like a feast,\" she went on; \"it is spread before everybody and\nnobody must touch it. What am I? Just a prisoner. In a cottage garden.\nLooking for ever over a hedge. I should be happier if I couldn't look.\nI remember once, only a little time ago, there was a cheap excursion to\nLondon. Our only servant went. She had to get up at an unearthly hour,\nand I--I got up too. I helped her to get off. And when she was gone I\nwent up to my bedroom again and cried. I cried with envy for any one,\nany one who could go away. I've been nowhere--except to school at\nChichester and three or four times to Emsworth and Bognor--for eight\nyears. When you go\"--the tears glittered in the moonlight--\"I shall cry.\nIt will be worse than the excursion to London.... Ever since you were\nhere before I've been thinking of it.\"\n\nIt seemed to Benham that here indeed was the very sister of his spirit.\nHis words sprang into his mind as one thinks of a repartee. \"But why\nshouldn't you come too?\" he said.\n\nShe stared at him in silence. The two white-lit faces examined each\nother. Both she and Benham were trembling.\n\n\"COME TOO?\" she repeated.\n\n\"Yes, with me.\"\n\n\"But--HOW?\"\n\nThen suddenly she was weeping like a child that is teased; her troubled\neyes looked out from under puckered brows. \"You don't mean it,\" she\nsaid. \"You don't mean it.\"\n\nAnd then indeed he meant it.\n\n\"Marry me,\" he said very quickly, glancing towards the dark group at the\nend of the garden. \"And we will go together.\"\n\nHe seized her arm and drew her to him. \"I love you,\" he said. \"I love\nyour spirit. You are not like any one else.\"\n\nThere was a moment's hesitation.\n\nBoth he and she looked to see how far they were still alone.\n\nThen they turned their dusky faces to each other. He drew her still\ncloser.\n\n\"Oh!\" she said, and yielded herself to be kissed. Their lips touched,\nand for a moment he held her lithe body against his own.\n\n\"I want you,\" he whispered close to her. \"You are my mate. From the\nfirst sight of you I knew that....\"\n\nThey embraced--alertly furtive.\n\nThen they stood a little apart. Some one was coming towards them.\nAmanda's bearing changed swiftly. She put up her little face to his,\nconfidently and intimately.\n\n\"Don't TELL any one,\" she whispered eagerly shaking his arm to emphasize\nher words. \"Don't tell any one--not yet. Not for a few days....\"\n\nShe pushed him from her quickly as the shadowy form of Betty appeared in\na little path between the artichokes and raspberry canes.\n\n\"Listening to the nightingales?\" cried Betty.\n\n\"Yes, aren't they?\" said Amanda inconsecutively.\n\n\"That's our very own nightingale!\" cried Betty advancing. \"Do you hear\nit, Mr. Benham? No, not that one. That is a quite inferior bird that\nperforms in the vicarage trees....\"\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nWhen a man has found and won his mate then the best traditions demand\na lyrical interlude. It should be possible to tell, in that\necstatic manner which melts words into moonshine, makes prose almost\nuncomfortably rhythmic, and brings all the freshness of every spring\nthat ever was across the page, of the joyous exaltation of the happy\nlover. This at any rate was what White had always done in his novels\nhitherto, and what he would certainly have done at this point had he had\nthe telling of Benham's story uncontrolledly in his hands. But, indeed,\nindeed, in real life, in very truth, the heart has not this simplicity.\nOnly the heroes of romance, and a few strong simple clean-shaven\nAmericans have that much emotional integrity. (And even the Americans do\nat times seem to an observant eye to be putting in work at the job and\nkeeping up their gladness.) Benham was excited that night, but not\nin the proper bright-eyed, red-cheeked way; he did not dance down the\nvillage street of Harting to his harbour at the Ship, and the expression\nin his eyes as he sat on the edge of his bed was not the deep elemental\nwonder one could have wished there, but amazement. Do not suppose\nthat he did not love Amanda, that a rich majority of his being was not\ntriumphantly glad to have won her, that the image of the two armour-clad\nlovers was not still striding and flourishing through the lit wilderness\nof his imagination. For three weeks things had pointed him to this.\nThey would do everything together now, he and his mate, they would scale\nmountains together and ride side by side towards ruined cities across\nthe deserts of the World. He could have wished no better thing. But at\nthe same time, even as he felt and admitted this and rejoiced at it, the\nsky of his mind was black with consternation....\n\nIt is remarkable, White reflected, as he turned over the abundant but\nconfused notes upon this perplexing phase of Benham's development that\nlay in the third drawer devoted to the Second Limitation, how dependent\nhuman beings are upon statement. Man is the animal that states a case.\nHe lives not in things but in expressed ideas, and what was troubling\nBenham inordinately that night, a night that should have been devoted to\npurely blissful and exalted expectations, was the sheer impossibility of\nstating what had happened in any terms that would be tolerable either\nto Mrs. Skelmersdale or Lady Marayne. The thing had happened with the\nsuddenness of a revelation. Whatever had been going on in the less\nilluminated parts of his mind, his manifest resolution had been\nmerely to bid South Harting good-bye-- And in short they would never\nunderstand. They would accuse him of the meanest treachery. He could see\nhis mother's face, he could hear her voice saying, \"And so because of\nthis sudden infatuation for a swindler's daughter, a girl who runs about\nthe roads with a couple of retrievers hunting for a man, you must\nspoil all my plans, ruin my year, tell me a lot of pretentious stuffy\nlies....\" And Mrs. Skelmersdale too would say, \"Of course he just talked\nof the world and duty and all that rubbish to save my face....\"\n\nIt wasn't so at all.\n\nBut it looked so frightfully like it!\n\nCouldn't they realize that he had fled out of London before ever he had\nseen Amanda? They might be able to do it perhaps, but they never would.\nIt just happened that in the very moment when the edifice of his noble\nresolutions had been ready, she had stepped into it--out of nothingness\nand nowhere. She wasn't an accident; that was just the point upon which\nthey were bound to misjudge her; she was an embodiment. If only he could\nshow her to them as she had first shown herself to him, swift, light, a\nlittle flushed from running but not in the least out of breath, quick\nas a leopard upon the dogs.... But even if the improbable opportunity\narose, he perceived it might still be impossible to produce the Amanda\nhe loved, the Amanda of the fluttering short skirt and the clear\nenthusiastic voice. Because, already he knew she was not the only\nAmanda. There was another, there might be others, there was this\nperplexing person who had flashed into being at the very moment of their\nmutual confession, who had produced the entirely disconcerting demand\nthat nobody must be told. Then Betty had intervened. But that sub-Amanda\nand her carneying note had to be dealt with on the first occasion,\nbecause when aristocrats love they don't care a rap who is told and who\nis not told. They just step out into the light side by side....\n\n\"Don't tell any one,\" she had said, \"not for a few days....\"\n\nThis sub-Amanda was perceptible next morning again, flitting about in\nthe background of a glad and loving adventuress, a pre-occupied Amanda\nwho had put her head down while the real Amanda flung her chin up and\ncontemplated things on the Asiatic scale, and who was apparently engaged\nin disentangling something obscure connected with Mr. Rathbone-Sanders\nthat ought never to have been entangled....\n\n\"A human being,\" White read, \"the simplest human being, is a clustering\nmass of aspects. No man will judge another justly who judges everything\nabout him. And of love in particular is this true. We love not persons\nbut revelations. The woman one loves is like a goddess hidden in a\nshrine; for her sake we live on hope and suffer the kindred priestesses\nthat make up herself. The art of love is patience till the gleam\nreturns....\"\n\nSunday and Monday did much to develop this idea of the intricate\ncomplexity of humanity in Benham's mind. On Monday morning he went\nup from the Ship again to get Amanda alone and deliver his ultimatum\nagainst a further secrecy, so that he could own her openly and have no\nmore of the interventions and separations that had barred him from any\nintimate talk with her throughout the whole of Sunday. The front door\nstood open, the passage hall was empty, but as he hesitated whether he\nshould proclaim himself with the knocker or walk through, the door of\nthe little drawing-room flew open and a black-clad cylindrical clerical\nperson entirely unknown to Benham stumbled over the threshold, blundered\nblindly against him, made a sound like \"MOO\" and a pitiful gesture with\nhis arm, and fled forth....\n\nIt was a curate and he was weeping bitterly....\n\nBenham stood in the doorway and watched a clumsy broken-hearted flight\ndown the village street.\n\nHe had been partly told and partly left to infer, and anyhow he was\nbeginning to understand about Mr. Rathbone-Sanders. That he could\ndismiss. But--why was the curate in tears?\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nHe found Amanda standing alone in the room from which this young man\nhad fled. She had a handful of daffodils in her hand, and others were\nscattered over the table. She had been arranging the big bowl of flowers\nin the centre. He left the door open behind him and stopped short with\nthe table between them. She looked up at him--intelligently and calmly.\nHer pose had a divine dignity.\n\n\"I want to tell them now,\" said Benham without a word of greeting.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"tell them now.\"\n\nThey heard steps in the passage outside. \"Betty!\" cried Amanda.\n\nHer mother's voice answered, \"Do you want Betty?\"\n\n\"We want you all,\" answered Amanda. \"We have something to tell you....\"\n\n\"Carrie!\" they heard Mrs. Morris call her sister after an interval, and\nher voice sounded faint and flat and unusual. There was the soft hissing\nof some whispered words outside and a muffled exclamation. Then Mrs.\nWilder and Mrs. Morris and Betty came into the room. Mrs. Wilder came\nfirst, and Mrs. Morris with an alarmed face as if sheltering behind her.\n\"We want to tell you something,\" said Amanda.\n\n\"Amanda and I are going to marry each other,\" said Benham, standing in\nfront of her.\n\nFor an instant the others made no answer; they looked at each other.\n\n\"BUT DOES HE KNOW?\" Mrs. Morris said in a low voice.\n\nAmanda turned her eyes to her lover. She was about to speak, she seemed\nto gather herself for an effort, and then he knew that he did not want\nto hear her explanation. He checked her by a gesture.\n\n\"I KNOW,\" he said, and then, \"I do not see that it matters to us in the\nleast.\"\n\nHe went to her holding out both his hands to her.\n\nShe took them and stood shyly for a moment, and then the watchful\ngravity of her face broke into soft emotion. \"Oh!\" she cried and seized\nhis face between her hands in a passion of triumphant love and kissed\nhim.\n\nAnd then he found himself being kissed by Mrs. Morris.\n\nShe kissed him thrice, with solemnity, with thankfulness, with relief,\nas if in the act of kissing she transferred to him precious and entirely\nincalculable treasures.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FOURTH ~~ THE SPIRITED HONEYMOON\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nIt was a little after sunrise one bright morning in September that\nBenham came up on to the deck of the sturdy Austrian steamboat that was\nchurning its way with a sedulous deliberation from Spalato to Cattaro,\nand lit himself a cigarette and seated himself upon a deck chair. Save\nfor a yawning Greek sailor busy with a mop the first-class deck was\nempty.\n\nBenham surveyed the haggard beauty of the Illyrian coast. The mountains\nrose gaunt and enormous and barren to a jagged fantastic silhouette\nagainst the sun; their almost vertical slopes still plunged in blue\nshadow, broke only into a little cold green and white edge of olive\nterraces and vegetation and houses before they touched the clear blue\nwater. An occasional church or a house perched high upon some seemingly\ninaccessible ledge did but accentuate the vast barrenness of the land.\nIt was a land desolated and destroyed. At Ragusa, at Salona, at Spalato\nand Zara and Pola Benham had seen only variations upon one persistent\ntheme, a dwindled and uncreative human life living amidst the giant\nruins of preceding times, as worms live in the sockets of a skull.\nForward an unsavoury group of passengers still slumbered amidst\nfruit-peel and expectorations, a few soldiers, some squalid brigands\narmed with preposterous red umbrellas, a group of curled-up human lumps\nbrooded over by an aquiline individual caparisoned with brass like a\nhorse, his head wrapped picturesquely in a shawl. Benham surveyed these\nlast products of the \"life force\" and resumed his pensive survey of the\ncoast. The sea was deserted save for a couple of little lateen craft\nwith suns painted on their gaudy sails, sea butterflies that hung\nmotionless as if unawakened close inshore....\n\nThe travel of the last few weeks had impressed Benham's imagination\nprofoundly. For the first time in his life he had come face to face\nwith civilization in defeat. From Venice hitherward he had marked with\ncumulative effect the clustering evidences of effort spent and power\ncrumbled to nothingness. He had landed upon the marble quay of Pola and\nvisited its deserted amphitheatre, he had seen a weak provincial life\ngoing about ignoble ends under the walls of the great Venetian fortress\nand the still more magnificent cathedral of Zara; he had visited\nSpalato, clustered in sweltering grime within the ample compass of the\nwalls of Diocletian's villa, and a few troublesome sellers of coins and\niridescent glass and fragments of tessellated pavement and such-like\nloot was all the population he had found amidst the fallen walls and\nbroken friezes and columns of Salona. Down this coast there ebbed and\nflowed a mean residual life, a life of violence and dishonesty, peddling\ntrades, vendettas and war. For a while the unstable Austrian ruled\nthis land and made a sort of order that the incalculable chances of\ninternational politics might at any time shatter. Benham was drawing\nnear now to the utmost limit of that extended peace. Ahead beyond the\nmountain capes was Montenegro and, further, Albania and Macedonia,\nlands of lawlessness and confusion. Amanda and he had been warned of the\nimpossibility of decent travel beyond Cattaro and Cettinje but this had\nbut whetted her adventurousness and challenged his spirit. They were\ngoing to see Albania for themselves.\n\nThe three months of honeymoon they had been spending together had\ndeveloped many remarkable divergences of their minds that had not been\nin the least apparent to Benham before their marriage. Then their\ncommon resolve to be as spirited as possible had obliterated all minor\nconsiderations. But that was the limit of their unanimity. Amanda loved\nwild and picturesque things, and Benham strong and clear things; the\nvines and brushwood amidst the ruins of Salona that had delighted her\nhad filled him with a sense of tragic retrogression. Salona had revived\nagain in the acutest form a dispute that had been smouldering between\nthem throughout a fitful and lengthy exploration of north and central\nItaly. She could not understand his disgust with the mediaeval colour\nand confusion that had swamped the pride and state of the Roman empire,\nand he could not make her feel the ambition of the ruler, the essential\ndiscipline and responsibilities of his aristocratic idea. While his\nadventurousness was conquest, hers, it was only too manifest, was\nbrigandage. His thoughts ran now into the form of an imaginary\ndiscourse, that he would never deliver to her, on the decay of states,\non the triumphs of barbarians over rulers who will not rule, on the\nrelaxation of patrician orders and the return of the robber and assassin\nas lordship decays. This coast was no theatrical scenery for him; it was\na shattered empire. And it was shattered because no men had been found,\nunited enough, magnificent and steadfast enough, to hold the cities,\nand maintain the roads, keep the peace and subdue the brutish hates and\nsuspicions and cruelties that devastated the world.\n\nAnd as these thoughts came back into his mind, Amanda flickered up from\nbelow, light and noiseless as a sunbeam, and stood behind his chair.\n\nFreedom and the sight of the world had if possible brightened and\ninvigorated her. Her costume and bearing were subtly touched by the\nromance of the Adriatic. There was a flavour of the pirate in the cloak\nabout her shoulders and the light knitted cap of scarlet she had stuck\nupon her head. She surveyed his preoccupation for a moment, glanced\nforward, and then covered his eyes with her hands. In almost the same\nmovement she had bent down and nipped the tip of his ear between her\nteeth.\n\n\"Confound you, Amanda!\"\n\n\"You'd forgotten my existence, you star-gazing Cheetah. And then, you\nsee, these things happen to you!\"\n\n\"I was thinking.\"\n\n\"Well--DON'T.... I distrust your thinking. This coast is wilder and\ngrimmer than yesterday. It's glorious....\"\n\nShe sat down on the chair he unfolded for her.\n\n\"Is there nothing to eat?\" she asked abruptly.\n\n\"It is too early.\"\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\"This coast is magnificent,\" she said presently.\n\n\"It's hideous,\" he answered. \"It's as ugly as a heap of slag.\"\n\n\"It's nature at its wildest.\"\n\n\"That's Amanda at her wildest.\"\n\n\"Well, isn't it?\"\n\n\"No! This land isn't nature. It's waste. Not wilderness. It's the other\nend. Those hills were covered with forests; this was a busy civilized\ncoast just a little thousand years ago. The Venetians wasted it.\nThey cut down the forests; they filled the cities with a mixed mud of\npopulation, THAT stuff. Look at it\"!--he indicated the sleepers forward\nby a movement of his head.\n\n\"I suppose they WERE rather feeble people,\" said Amanda.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"The Venetians.\"\n\n\"They were traders--and nothing more. Just as we are. And when they were\nrich they got splendid clothes and feasted and rested. Much as we do.\"\n\nAmanda surveyed him. \"We don't rest.\"\n\n\"We idle.\"\n\n\"We are seeing things.\"\n\n\"Don't be a humbug, Amanda. We are making love. Just as they did. And\nit has been--ripping. In Salona they made love tremendously. They did\nnothing else until the barbarians came over the mountains....\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Amanda virtuously, \"we will do something else.\"\n\nHe made no answer and her expression became profoundly thoughtful. Of\ncourse this wandering must end. He had been growing impatient for some\ntime. But it was difficult, she perceived, to decide just what to do\nwith him....\n\nBenham picked up the thread of his musing.\n\nHe was seeing more and more clearly that all civilization was an effort,\nand so far always an inadequate and very partially successful effort.\nAlways it had been aristocratic, aristocratic in the sense that it was\nthe work of minorities, who took power, who had a common resolution\nagainst the inertia, the indifference, the insubordination and\ninstinctive hostility of the mass of mankind. And always the set-backs,\nthe disasters of civilization, had been failures of the aristocratic\nspirit. Why had the Roman purpose faltered and shrivelled? Every order,\nevery brotherhood, every organization carried with it the seeds of\nits own destruction. Must the idea of statecraft and rule perpetually\nreappear, reclothe itself in new forms, age, die, even as life\ndoes--making each time its almost infinitesimal addition to human\nachievement? Now the world is crying aloud for a renascence of the\nspirit that orders and controls. Human affairs sway at a dizzy height of\nopportunity. Will they keep their footing there, or stagger? We have\ngot back at last to a time as big with opportunity as the early empire.\nGiven only the will in men and it would be possible now to turn the\ndazzling accidents of science, the chancy attainments of the nineteenth\ncentury, into a sane and permanent possession, a new starting point....\nWhat a magnificence might be made of life!\n\nHe was aroused by Amanda's voice.\n\n\"When we go back to London, old Cheetah,\" she said, \"we must take a\nhouse.\"\n\nFor some moments he stared at her, trying to get back to their point of\ndivergence.\n\n\"Why?\" he asked at length.\n\n\"We must have a house,\" she said.\n\nHe looked at her face. Her expression was profoundly thoughtful, her\neyes were fixed on the slumbering ships poised upon the transparent\nwater under the mountain shadows.\n\n\"You see,\" she thought it out, \"you've got to TELL in London. You can't\njust sneak back there. You've got to strike a note of your own. With all\nthese things of yours.\"\n\n\"But how?\"\n\n\"There's a sort of little house, I used to see them when I was a girl\nand my father lived in London, about Brook Street and that part. Not\ntoo far north.... You see going back to London for us is just another\nadventure. We've got to capture London. We've got to scale it. We've\ngot advantages of all sorts. But at present we're outside. We've got to\nmarch in.\"\n\nHer clear hazel eyes contemplated conflicts and triumphs.\n\nShe was roused by Benham's voice.\n\n\"What the deuce are you thinking of, Amanda?\"\n\nShe turned her level eyes to his. \"London,\" she said. \"For you.\"\n\n\"I don't want London,\" he said.\n\n\"I thought you did. You ought to. I do.\"\n\n\"But to take a house! Make an invasion of London!\"\n\n\"You dear old Cheetah, you can't be always frisking about in the\nwilderness, staring at the stars.\"\n\n\"But I'm not going back to live in London in the old way, theatres,\ndinner-parties, chatter--\"\n\n\"Oh no! We aren't going to do that sort of thing. We aren't going to\njoin the ruck. We'll go about in holiday times all over the world. I\nwant to see Fusiyama. I mean to swim in the South Seas. With you. We'll\ndodge the sharks. But all the same we shall have to have a house in\nLondon. We have to be FELT there.\"\n\nShe met his consternation fairly. She lifted her fine eyebrows. Her\nlittle face conveyed a protesting reasonableness.\n\n\"Well, MUSTN'T we?\"\n\nShe added, \"If we want to alter the world we ought to live in the\nworld.\"\n\nSince last they had disputed the question she had thought out these new\nphrases.\n\n\"Amanda,\" he said, \"I think sometimes you haven't the remotest idea of\nwhat I am after. I don't believe you begin to suspect what I am up to.\"\n\nShe put her elbows on her knees, dropped her chin between her hands and\nregarded him impudently. She had a characteristic trick of looking up\nwith her face downcast that never failed to soften his regard.\n\n\"Look here, Cheetah, don't you give way to your early morning habit of\ncalling your own true love a fool,\" she said.\n\n\"Simply I tell you I will not go back to London.\"\n\n\"You will go back with me, Cheetah.\"\n\n\"I will go back as far as my work calls me there.\"\n\n\"It calls you through the voice of your mate and slave and doormat to\njust exactly the sort of house you ought to have.... It is the privilege\nand duty of the female to choose the lair.\"\n\nFor a space Benham made no reply. This controversy had been gathering\nfor some time and he wanted to state his view as vividly as possible.\nThe Benham style of connubial conversation had long since decided for\nemphasis rather than delicacy.\n\n\"I think,\" he said slowly, \"that this wanting to take London by storm is\na beastly VULGAR thing to want to do.\"\n\nAmanda compressed her lips.\n\n\"I want to work out things in my mind,\" he went on. \"I do not want to\nbe distracted by social things, and I do not want to be distracted by\npicturesque things. This life--it's all very well on the surface, but it\nisn't real. I'm not getting hold of reality. Things slip away from me.\nGod! but how they slip away from me!\"\n\nHe got up and walked to the side of the boat.\n\nShe surveyed his back for some moments. Then she went and leant over the\nrail beside him.\n\n\"I want to go to London,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't.\"\n\n\"Where do you want to go?\"\n\n\"Where I can see into the things that hold the world together.\"\n\n\"I have loved this wandering--I could wander always. But... Cheetah! I\ntell you I WANT to go to London.\"\n\nHe looked over his shoulder into her warm face. \"NO,\" he said.\n\n\"But, I ask you.\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\nShe put her face closer and whispered. \"Cheetah! big beast of my heart.\nDo you hear your mate asking for something?\"\n\nHe turned his eyes back to the mountains. \"I must go my own way.\"\n\n\"Haven't I, so far, invented things, made life amusing, Cheetah? Can't\nyou trust the leopard's wisdom?\"\n\nHe stared at the coast inexorably.\n\n\"I wonder,\" she whispered.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You ARE that, Cheetah, that lank, long, EAGER beast--.\"\n\nSuddenly with a nimble hand she had unbuttoned and rolled up the sleeve\nof her blouse. She stuck her pretty blue-veined arm before his eyes.\n\"Look here, sir, it was you, wasn't it? It was your powerful jaw\ninflicted this bite upon the arm of a defenceless young leopardess--\"\n\n\"Amanda!\"\n\n\"Well.\" She wrinkled her brows.\n\nHe turned about and stood over her, he shook a finger in her face and\nthere was a restrained intensity in his voice as he spoke.\n\n\"Look here, Amanda!\" he said, \"if you think that you are going to\nmake me agree to any sort of project about London, to any sort of\ncomplication of our lives with houses in smart streets and a campaign of\nsocial assertion--by THAT, then may I be damned for an uxorious fool!\"\n\nHer eyes met his and there was mockery in her eyes.\n\n\"This, Cheetah, is the morning mood,\" she remarked.\n\n\"This is the essential mood. Listen, Amanda--\"\n\nHe stopped short. He looked towards the gangway, they both looked. The\nmagic word \"Breakfast\" came simultaneously from them.\n\n\"Eggs,\" she said ravenously, and led the way.\n\nA smell of coffee as insistent as an herald's trumpet had called a truce\nbetween them.\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nTheir marriage had been a comparatively inconspicuous one, but since\nthat time they had been engaged upon a honeymoon of great extent and\nvariety. Their wedding had taken place at South Harting church in the\nmarked absence of Lady Marayne, and it had been marred by only one\nuntoward event. The Reverend Amos Pugh who, in spite of the earnest\nadvice of several friends had insisted upon sharing in the ceremony, had\nsuddenly covered his face with the sleeves of his surplice and fled with\na swift rustle to the vestry, whence an uproar of inadequately smothered\nsorrow came as an obligato accompaniment to the more crucial passages\nof the service. Amanda appeared unaware of the incident at the time,\nbut afterwards she explained things to Benham. \"Curates,\" she said, \"are\nsuch pent-up men. One ought, I suppose, to remember that. But he\nnever had anything to go upon at all--not anything--except his own\nimaginations.\"\n\n\"I suppose when you met him you were nice to him.\"\n\n\"I was nice to him, of course....\"\n\nThey drove away from Harting, as it were, over the weeping remains of\nthis infatuated divine. His sorrow made them thoughtful for a time, and\nthen Amanda nestled closer to her lover and they forgot about him, and\ntheir honeymoon became so active and entertaining that only very rarely\nand transitorily did they ever think of him again.\n\nThe original conception of their honeymoon had been identical with the\nplans Benham had made for the survey and study of the world, and it was\nthrough a series of modifications, replacements and additions that it\nbecame at last a prolonged and very picturesque tour in Switzerland,\nthe Austrian Tyrol, North Italy, and down the Adriatic coast. Amanda\nhad never seen mountains, and longed, she said, to climb. This took them\nfirst to Switzerland. Then, in spite of their exalted aims, the devotion\nof their lives to noble purposes, it was evident that Amanda had no\nintention of scamping the detail of love, and for that what background\nis so richly beautiful as Italy? An important aspect of the grand tour\nround the world as Benham had planned it, had been interviews, inquiries\nand conversations with every sort of representative and understanding\nperson he could reach. An unembarrassed young man who wants to know and\ndoes not promise to bore may reach almost any one in that way, he is as\nimpersonal as pure reason and as mobile as a letter, but the presence of\na lady in his train leaves him no longer unembarrassed. His approach has\nbecome a social event. The wife of a great or significant personage must\ntake notice or decide not to take notice. Of course Amanda was prepared\nto go anywhere, just as Benham's shadow; it was the world that was\nunprepared. And a second leading aspect of his original scheme had been\nthe examination of the ways of government in cities and the shifting\nand mixture of nations and races. It would have led to back streets, and\ninvolved and complicated details, and there was something in the fine\nflame of girlhood beside him that he felt was incompatible with those\nshadows and that dust. And also they were lovers and very deeply\nin love. It was amazing how swiftly that draggled shameful London\nsparrow-gamin, Eros, took heart from Amanda, and became wonderful,\nbeautiful, glowing, life-giving, confident, clear-eyed; how he changed\nfrom flesh to sweet fire, and grew until he filled the sky. So that you\nsee they went to Switzerland and Italy at last very like two ordinary\nyoung people who were not aristocrats at all, had no theory about the\nworld or their destiny, but were simply just ardently delighted with the\ndiscovery of one another.\n\nNevertheless Benham was for some time under a vague impression that in\na sort of way still he was going round the world and working out his\ndestinies.\n\nIt was part of the fascination of Amanda that she was never what he had\nsupposed her to be, and that nothing that he set out to do with her ever\nturned out as they had planned it. Her appreciations marched before her\nachievement, and when it came to climbing it seemed foolish to toil\nto summits over which her spirit had flitted days before. Their Swiss\nexpeditions which she had foreseen as glorious wanderings amidst the\nblue ice of crevasses and nights of exalted hardihood became a walking\ntour of fitful vigour and abundant fun and delight. They spent a long\nday on the ice of the Aletsch glacier, but they reached the inn on its\neastward side with magnificent appetites a little late for dinner.\n\nAmanda had revealed an unexpected gift for nicknames and pretty fancies.\nShe named herself the Leopard, the spotless Leopard; in some obscure\nway she intimated that the colour was black, but that was never to be\nadmitted openly, there was supposed to be some lurking traces of a rusty\nbrown but the word was spotless and the implication white, a dazzling\nwhite, she would play a thousand variations on the theme; in moments of\ndespondency she was only a black cat, a common lean black cat, and\nsacks and half-bricks almost too good for her. But Benham was always\na Cheetah. That had come to her as a revelation from heaven. But so\nclearly he was a Cheetah. He was a Hunting Leopard; the only beast that\nhas an up-cast face and dreams and looks at you with absent-minded eyes\nlike a man. She laced their journeys with a fantastic monologue telling\nin the third person what the Leopard and the Cheetah were thinking and\nseeing and doing. And so they walked up mountains and over passes and\nswam in the warm clear water of romantic lakes and loved each other\nmightily always, in chestnut woods and olive orchards and flower-starred\nalps and pine forests and awning-covered boats, and by sunset and\nmoonlight and starshine; and out of these agreeable solitudes they\ncame brown and dusty, striding side by side into sunlit entertaining\nfruit-piled market-places and envious hotels. For days and weeks\ntogether it did not seem to Benham that there was anything that mattered\nin life but Amanda and the elemental joys of living. And then the\nResearch Magnificent began to stir in him again. He perceived that Italy\nwas not India, that the clue to the questions he must answer lay in the\ncrowded new towns that they avoided, in the packed bookshops and the\ntalk of men, and not in the picturesque and flowery solitudes to which\ntheir lovemaking carried them.\n\nMoods began in which he seemed to forget Amanda altogether.\n\nThis happened first in the Certosa di Pavia whither they had gone one\nafternoon from Milan. That was quite soon after they were married. They\nhad a bumping journey thither in a motor-car, a little doubtful if\nthe excursion was worth while, and they found a great amazement in\nthe lavish beauty and decorative wealth of that vast church and its\nassociated cloisters, set far away from any population as it seemed in\na flat wilderness of reedy ditches and patchy cultivation. The\ndistilleries and outbuildings were deserted--their white walls were\ncovered by one monstrously great and old wisteria in flower--the soaring\nmarvellous church was in possession of a knot of unattractive guides.\nOne of these conducted them through the painted treasures of the gold\nand marble chapels; he was an elderly but animated person who evidently\nfound Amanda more wonderful than any church. He poured out great\naccumulations of information and compliments before her. Benham dropped\nbehind, went astray and was presently recovered dreaming in the great\ncloister. The guide showed them over two of the cells that opened\nthereupon, each a delightful house for a solitary, bookish and clean,\nand each with a little secret walled garden of its own. He was covertly\ntipped against all regulations and departed regretfully with a beaming\ndismissal from Amanda. She found Benham wondering why the Carthusians\nhad failed to produce anything better in the world than a liqueur. \"One\nmight have imagined that men would have done something in this beautiful\nquiet; that there would have come thought from here or will from here.\"\n\n\"In these dear little nests they ought to have put lovers,\" said Amanda.\n\n\"Oh, of course, YOU would have made the place Thelema....\"\n\nBut as they went shaking and bumping back along the evil road to Milan,\nhe fell into a deep musing. Suddenly he said, \"Work has to be done.\nBecause this order or that has failed, there is no reason why we should\nfail. And look at those ragged children in the road ahead of us, and\nthose dirty women sitting in the doorways, and the foul ugliness of\nthese gaunt nameless towns through which we go! They are what they are,\nbecause we are what we are--idlers, excursionists. In a world we ought\nto rule....\n\n\"Amanda, we've got to get to work....\"\n\nThat was his first display of this new mood, which presently became a\ncommon one. He was less and less content to let the happy hours slip\nby, more and more sensitive to the reminders in giant ruin and deserted\ncell, in a chance encounter with a string of guns and soldiers on their\nway to manoeuvres or in the sight of a stale newspaper, of a great\nworld process going on in which he was now playing no part at all. And\na curious irritability manifested itself more and more plainly, whenever\nhuman pettiness obtruded upon his attention, whenever some trivial\ndishonesty, some manifest slovenliness, some spiritless failure, a\ncheating waiter or a wayside beggar brought before him the shiftless,\nselfish, aimless elements in humanity that war against the great dream\nof life made glorious. \"Accursed things,\" he would say, as he flung some\nimportunate cripple at a church door a ten-centime piece; \"why were they\nborn? Why do they consent to live? They are no better than some chance\nfungus that is because it must.\"\n\n\"It takes all sorts to make a world,\" said Amanda.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said Benham. \"Where is the megatherium? That sort of\ncreature has to go. Our sort of creature has to end it.\"\n\n\"Then why did you give it money?\"\n\n\"Because-- I don't want the thing to be more wretched than it is. But if\nI could prevent more of them--... What am I doing to prevent them?\"\n\n\"These beggars annoy you,\" said Amanda after a pause. \"They do me. Let\nus go back into the mountains.\"\n\nBut he fretted in the mountains.\n\nThey made a ten days' tour from Macugnaga over the Monte Moro to Sass,\nand thence to Zermatt and back by the Theodule to Macugnaga. The sudden\napparition of douaniers upon the Monte Moro annoyed Benham, and he was\nalso irritated by the solemn English mountain climbers at Saas Fee.\nThey were as bad as golfers, he said, and reflected momentarily upon\nhis father. Amanda fell in love with Monte Rosa, she wanted to kiss its\nsnowy forehead, she danced like a young goat down the path to Mattmark,\nand rolled on the turf when she came to gentians and purple primulas.\nBenham was tremendously in love with her most of the time, but one\nday when they were sitting over the Findelen glacier his perceptions\nblundered for the first time upon the fundamental antagonism of their\nquality. She was sketching out jolly things that they were to do\ntogether, expeditions, entertainments, amusements, and adventures, with\na voluble swiftness, and suddenly in a flash his eyes were opened, and\nhe saw that she would never for a moment feel the quality that made life\nworth while for him. He saw it in a flash, and in that flash he made\nhis urgent resolve not to see it. From that moment forth his bearing was\npoisoned by his secret determination not to think of this, not to admit\nit to his mind. And forbidden to come into his presence in its proper\nform, this conflict of intellectual temperaments took on strange\ndisguises, and the gathering tension of his mind sought to relieve\nitself along grotesque irrelevant channels.\n\nThere was, for example, the remarkable affair of the drive from\nMacugnaga to Piedimulera.\n\nThey had decided to walk down in a leisurely fashion, but with the\nfatigues of the precipitous clamber down from Switzerland still upon\nthem they found the white road between rock above and gorge below\nwearisome, and the valley hot in the late morning sunshine, and already\nbefore they reached the inn they had marked for lunch Amanda had\nsuggested driving the rest of the way. The inn had a number of\nbrigand-like customers consuming such sustenance as garlic and salami\nand wine; it received them with an indifference that bordered on\ndisrespect, until the landlord, who seemed to be something of a beauty\nhimself, discovered the merits of Amanda. Then he became markedly\nattentive. He was a large, fat, curly-headed person with beautiful eyes,\na cherished moustache, and an air of great gentility, and when he had\nwelcomed his guests and driven off the slatternly waiting-maid, and\ngiven them his best table, and consented, at Amanda's request, to open a\nwindow, he went away and put on a tie and collar. It was an attention\nso conspicuous that even the group of men in the far corner noticed and\ncommented on it, and then they commented on Amanda and Benham,\nassuming an ignorance of Italian in the visitors that was only partly\njustifiable. \"Bellissima,\" \"bravissima,\" \"signorina,\" \"Inglesa,\" one\nneed not be born in Italy to understand such words as these. Also they\naddressed sly comments and encouragements to the landlord as he went to\nand fro.\n\nBenham was rather still and stiff during the meal, but it ill becomes\nan English aristocrat to discuss the manners of an alien population, and\nAmanda was amused by the effusion of the landlord and a little disposed\nto experiment upon him. She sat radiating light amidst the shadows.\n\nThe question of the vehicle was broached. The landlord was doubtful,\nthen an idea, it was manifestly a questionable idea, occurred to him.\nHe went to consult an obscure brown-faced individual in the corner,\ndisappeared, and the world without became eloquent. Presently he\nreturned and announced that a carozza was practicable. It had been\ndifficult, but he had contrived it. And he remained hovering over the\nconclusion of their meal, asking questions about Amanda's mountaineering\nand expressing incredulous admiration.\n\nHis bill, which he presented with an uneasy flourish, was large and\nincluded the carozza.\n\nHe ushered them out to the carriage with civilities and compliments. It\nhad manifestly been difficult and contrived. It was dusty and blistered,\nthere had been a hasty effort to conceal its recent use as a hen-roost,\nthe harness was mended with string. The horse was gaunt and scandalous,\na dirty white, and carried its head apprehensively. The driver had but\none eye, through which there gleamed a concentrated hatred of God and\nman.\n\n\"No wonder he charged for it before we saw it,\" said Benham.\n\n\"It's better than walking,\" said Amanda.\n\nThe company in the inn gathered behind the landlord and scrutinized\nAmanda and Benham intelligently. The young couple got in. \"Avanti,\" said\nBenham, and Amanda bestowed one last ineradicable memory on the bowing\nlandlord.\n\nBenham did not speak until just after they turned the first corner, and\nthen something portentous happened, considering the precipitous position\nof the road they were upon. A small boy appeared sitting in the grass\nby the wayside, and at the sight of him the white horse shied\nextravagantly. The driver rose in his seat ready to jump. But the crisis\npassed without a smash. \"Cheetah!\" cried Amanda suddenly. \"This isn't\nsafe.\" \"Ah!\" said Benham, and began to act with the vigour of one\nwho has long accumulated force. He rose in his place and gripped the\none-eyed driver by the collar. \"ASPETTO,\" he said, but he meant \"Stop!\"\nThe driver understood that he meant \"Stop,\" and obeyed.\n\nBenham wasted no time in parleying with the driver. He indicated to him\nand to Amanda by a comprehensive gesture that he had business with the\nlandlord, and with a gleaming appetite upon his face went running back\ntowards the inn.\n\nThe landlord was sitting down to a little game of dominoes with his\nfriends when Benham reappeared in the sunlight of the doorway. There was\nno misunderstanding Benham's expression.\n\nFor a moment the landlord was disposed to be defiant. Then he changed\nhis mind. Benham's earnest face was within a yard of his own, and a\nthreatening forefinger was almost touching his nose.\n\n\"Albergo cattivissimo,\" said Benham. \"Cattivissimo! Pranzo cattivissimo\n'orrido. Cavallo cattivissimo, dangerousissimo. Gioco abominablissimo,\ndamnissimo. Capisce. Eh?\" [*]\n\n     * This is vile Italian. It may--with a certain charity to\n     Benham--be rendered: \"The beastliest inn! The beastliest!\n     The beastliest, most awful lunch! The vilest horse! Most\n     dangerous! Abominable trick! Understand?\"\n\n\nThe landlord made deprecatory gestures.\n\n\"YOU understand all right,\" said Benham. \"Da me il argento per il\ncarozzo. Subito?\" [*]\n\n\n     * \"Give me back the money for the carriage. QUICKLY!\"\n\n\nThe landlord was understood to ask whether the signor no longer wished\nfor the carriage.\n\n\"SUBITO!\" cried Benham, and giving way to a long-restrained impulse\nseized the padrone by the collar of his coat and shook him vigorously.\n\nThere were dissuasive noises from the company, but no attempt at rescue.\nBenham released his hold.\n\n\"Adesso!\" said Benham. [*]\n\n     * \"NOW!\"\n\nThe landlord decided to disgorge. It was at any rate a comfort that the\nbeautiful lady was not seeing anything of this. And he could explain\nafterwards to his friends that the Englishman was clearly a lunatic,\ndeserving pity rather than punishment. He made some sound of protest,\nbut attempted no delay in refunding the money Benham had prepaid.\nOutside sounded the wheels of the returning carriage. They stopped.\nAmanda appeared in the doorway and discovered Benham dominant.\n\nHe was a little short of breath, and as she came in he was addressing\nthe landlord with much earnestness in the following compact sentences.\n\n\"Attendez! Ecco! Adesso noi andiamo con questa cattivissimo cavallo a\nPiedimulera. Si noi arrivero in safety, securo that is, pagaremo. Non\naltro. Si noi abbiamo accidento Dio--Dio have mercy on your sinful soul.\nSee! Capisce? That's all.\" [*]\n\n     * \"Now we will go with this beastly horse to Piedimulera. If\n     we get there safely I will pay. If we have an accident,\n     then--\"\n\nHe turned to Amanda. \"Get back into the thing,\" he said. \"We won't have\nthese stinking beasts think we are afraid of the job. I've just made\nsure he won't have a profit by it if we smash up. That's all. I might\nhave known what he was up to when he wanted the money beforehand.\"\nHe came to the doorway and with a magnificent gesture commanded the\nperplexed driver to turn the carriage.\n\nWhile that was being done he discoursed upon his adjacent\nfellow-creatures. \"A man who pays beforehand for anything in this filthy\nsort of life is a fool. You see the standards of the beast. They think\nof nothing but their dirty little tricks to get profit, their garlic,\ntheir sour wine, their games of dominoes, their moments of lust. They\ncrawl in this place like cockroaches in a warm corner of the fireplace\nuntil they die. Look at the scabby frontage of the house. Look at the\nmen's faces.... Yes. So! Adequato. Aspettate.... Get back into the\ncarriage, Amanda.\"\n\n\"You know it's dangerous, Cheetah. The horse is a shier. That man is\nblind in one eye.\"\n\n\"Get back into the carriage,\" said Benham, whitely angry. \"I AM GOING TO\nDRIVE!\"\n\n\"But--!\"\n\nJust for a moment Amanda looked scared. Then with a queer little laugh\nshe jumped in again.\n\nAmanda was never a coward when there was excitement afoot. \"We'll\nsmash!\" she cried, by no means woefully.\n\n\"Get up beside me,\" said Benham speaking in English to the driver but\nwith a gesture that translated him. Power over men radiated from\nBenham in this angry mood. He took the driver's seat. The little driver\nascended and then with a grim calmness that brooked no resistance Benham\nreached over, took and fastened the apron over their knees to prevent\nany repetition of the jumping out tactics.\n\nThe recovering landlord became voluble in the doorway.\n\n\"In Piedimulera pagero,\" said Benham over his shoulder and brought the\nwhip across the white outstanding ribs. \"Get up!\" said Benham.\n\nAmanda gripped the sides of the seat as the carriage started into\nmotion.\n\nHe laid the whip on again with such vigour that the horse forgot\naltogether to shy at the urchin that had scared it before.\n\n\"Amanda,\" said Benham leaning back. \"If we do happen to go over on THAT\nside, jump out. It's all clear and wide for you. This side won't matter\nso--\"\n\n\"MIND!\" screamed Amanda and recalled him to his duties. He was off the\nroad and he had narrowly missed an outstanding chestnut true.\n\n\"No, you don't,\" said Benham presently, and again their career became\nerratic for a time as after a slight struggle he replaced the apron over\nthe knees of the deposed driver. It had been furtively released. After\nthat Benham kept an eye on it that might have been better devoted to the\nroad.\n\nThe road went down in a series of curves and corners. Now and then there\nwere pacific interludes when it might have been almost any road. Then,\nagain, it became specifically an Italian mountain road. Now and then\nonly a row of all too infrequent granite stumps separated them from a\nsheer precipice. Some of the corners were miraculous, and once they had\na wheel in a ditch for a time, they shaved the parapet of a bridge over\na gorge and they drove a cyclist into a patch of maize, they narrowly\nmissed a goat and jumped three gullies, thrice the horse stumbled and\nwas jerked up in time, there were sickening moments, and withal they\ngot down to Piedimulera unbroken and unspilt. It helped perhaps that the\nbrake, with its handle like a barrel organ, had been screwed up before\nBenham took control. And when they were fairly on the level outside the\ntown Benham suddenly pulled up, relinquished the driving into the proper\nhands and came into the carriage with Amanda.\n\n\"Safe now,\" he said compactly.\n\nThe driver appeared to be murmuring prayers very softly as he examined\nthe brake.\n\nAmanda was struggling with profound problems. \"Why didn't you drive down\nin the first place?\" she asked. \"Without going back.\"\n\n\"The landlord annoyed me,\" he said. \"I had to go back.... I wish I had\nkicked him. Hairy beast! If anything had happened, you see, he would\nhave had his mean money. I couldn't bear to leave him.\"\n\n\"And why didn't you let HIM drive?\" She indicated the driver by a motion\nof the head.\n\n\"I was angry,\" said Benham. \"I was angry at the whole thing.\"\n\n\"Still--\"\n\n\"You see I think I did that because he might have jumped off if I hadn't\nbeen up there to prevent him--I mean if we had had a smash. I didn't\nwant him to get out of it.\"\n\n\"But you too--\"\n\n\"You see I was angry....\"\n\n\"It's been as good as a switchback,\" said Amanda after reflection. \"But\nweren't you a little careless about me, Cheetah?\"\n\n\"I never thought of you,\" said Benham, and then as if he felt that\ninadequate: \"You see--I was so annoyed. It's odd at times how annoyed\none gets. Suddenly when that horse shied I realized what a beastly\nbusiness life was--as those brutes up there live it. I want to clear out\nthe whole hot, dirty, little aimless nest of them....\"\n\n\"No, I'm sure,\" he repeated after a pause as though he had been\ndigesting something \"I wasn't thinking about you at all.\"\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nThe suppression of his discovery that his honeymoon was not in the least\nthe great journey of world exploration he had intended, but merely\nan impulsive pleasure hunt, was by no means the only obscured and\nrepudiated conflict that disturbed the mind and broke out upon the\nbehaviour of Benham. Beneath that issue he was keeping down a far more\nintimate conflict. It was in those lower, still less recognized depths\nthat the volcanic fire arose and the earthquakes gathered strength. The\nAmanda he had loved, the Amanda of the gallant stride and fluttering\nskirt was with him still, she marched rejoicing over the passes, and\na dearer Amanda, a soft whispering creature with dusky hair, who took\npossession of him when she chose, a soft creature who was nevertheless a\nfierce creature, was also interwoven with his life. But-- But there was\nnow also a multitude of other Amandas who had this in common that they\nroused him to opposition, that they crossed his moods and jarred upon\nhis spirit. And particularly there was the Conquering Amanda not so much\nproud of her beauty as eager to test it, so that she was not unmindful\nof the stir she made in hotel lounges, nor of the magic that may shine\nmemorably through the most commonplace incidental conversation. This\nAmanda was only too manifestly pleased to think that she made peasant\nlovers discontented and hotel porters unmercenary; she let her light\nshine before men. We lovers, who had deemed our own subjugation a\nprofound privilege, love not this further expansiveness of our lady's\nempire. But Benham knew that no aristocrat can be jealous; jealousy he\nheld to be the vice of the hovel and farmstead and suburban villa, and\nat an enormous expenditure of will he ignored Amanda's waving flags and\nroving glances. So, too, he denied that Amanda who was sharp and shrewd\nabout money matters, that flash of an Amanda who was greedy for presents\nand possessions, that restless Amanda who fretted at any cessation of\nexcitement, and that darkly thoughtful Amanda whom chance observations\nand questions showed to be still considering an account she had to\nsettle with Lady Marayne. He resisted these impressions, he shut them\nout of his mind, but still they worked into his thoughts, and presently\nhe could find himself asking, even as he and she went in step striding\nside by side through the red-scarred pinewoods in the most perfect\noutward harmony, whether after all he was so happily mated as he\ndeclared himself to be a score of times a day, whether he wasn't\ncatching glimpses of reality through a veil of delusion that grew\nthinner and thinner and might leave him disillusioned in the face of a\nrelationship--\n\nSometimes a man may be struck by a thought as though he had been struck\nin the face, and when the name of Mrs. Skelmersdale came into his head,\nhe glanced at his wife by his side as if it were something that\nshe might well have heard. Was this indeed the same thing as that?\nWonderful, fresh as the day of Creation, clean as flame, yet the same!\nWas Amanda indeed the sister of Mrs. Skelmersdale--wrought of clean\nfire, but her sister?...\n\nBut also beside the inimical aspects which could set such doubts afoot\nthere were in her infinite variety yet other Amandas neither very dear\nnor very annoying, but for the most part delightful, who entertained him\nas strangers might, Amandas with an odd twist which made them amusing to\nwatch, jolly Amandas who were simply irrelevant. There was for example\nAmanda the Dog Mistress, with an astonishing tact and understanding of\ndogs, who could explain dogs and the cock of their ears and the droop of\ntheir tails and their vanity and their fidelity, and why they looked up\nand why they suddenly went off round the corner, and their pride in\nthe sound of their voices and their dastardly thoughts and sniffing\nsatisfactions, so that for the first time dogs had souls for Benham to\nsee. And there was an Amanda with a striking passion for the sleekness\nand soft noses of horses. And there was an Amanda extremely garrulous,\nwho was a biographical dictionary and critical handbook to all the girls\nin the school she had attended at Chichester--they seemed a very girlish\nlot of girls; and an Amanda who was very knowing--knowing was the only\nword for it--about pictures and architecture. And these and all the\nother Amandas agreed together to develop and share this one quality\nin common, that altogether they pointed to no end, they converged on\nnothing. She was, it grew more and more apparent, a miscellany bound\nin a body. She was an animated discursiveness. That passion to get all\nthings together into one aristocratic aim, that restraint of purpose,\nthat imperative to focus, which was the structural essential of Benham's\nspirit, was altogether foreign to her composition.\n\nThere were so many Amandas, they were as innumerable as the\nVenuses--Cytherea, Cypria, Paphia, Popularia, Euploea, Area,\nVerticordia, Etaira, Basilea, Myrtea, Libertina, Freya, Astarte,\nPhilommedis, Telessigamma, Anadyomene, and a thousand others to whom men\nhave bowed and built temples, a thousand and the same, and yet it seemed\nto Benham there was still one wanting.\n\nThe Amanda he had loved most wonderfully was that Amanda in armour who\nhad walked with him through the wilderness of the world along the road\nto Chichester--and that Amanda came back to him no more.\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nAmanda too was making her observations and discoveries.\n\nThese moods of his perplexed her; she was astonished to find he was\nbecoming irritable; she felt that he needed a firm but gentle discipline\nin his deportment as a lover. At first he had been perfect....\n\nBut Amanda was more prepared for human inconsecutiveness than Benham,\nbecause she herself was inconsecutive, and her dissatisfaction with his\nirritations and preoccupation broadened to no general discontent. He had\nseemed perfect and he wasn't. So nothing was perfect. And he had to\nbe managed, just as one must manage a dog or a cousin or a mother or a\nhorse. Anyhow she had got him, she had no doubt that she held him by a\nthousand ties, the spotless leopard had him between her teeth, he was a\nprisoner in the dusk of her hair, and the world was all one vast promise\nof entertainment.\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nBut the raid into the Balkans was not the tremendous success she had\nexpected it to be. They had adventures, but they were not the richly\ncoloured, mediaeval affairs she had anticipated. For the most part until\nBenham broke loose beyond Ochrida they were adventures in discomfort. In\nthose remote parts of Europe inns die away and cease, and it had never\noccurred to Amanda that inns could die away anywhere. She had thought\nthat they just became very simple and natural and quaint. And she had\nthought that when benighted people knocked at a door it would presently\nopen hospitably. She had not expected shots at random from the window.\nAnd it is not usual in Albania generally for women, whether they are\nChristian or Moslem, to go about unveiled; when they do so it leads\nto singular manifestations. The moral sense of the men is shocked and\nstaggered, and they show it in many homely ways. Small boys at that\nage when feminine beauty does not yet prevail with them, pelt. Also\nin Mahometan districts they pelt men who do not wear fezzes, while\noccasionally Christians of the shawl-headed or skull-cap persuasions\nwill pelt a fez. Sketching is always a peltable or mobable offence,\nas being contrary to the Koran, and sitting down tempts the pelter.\nGenerally they pelt. The dogs of Albania are numerous, big, dirty, white\ndogs, large and hostile, and they attack with little hesitation. The\nwomen of Albania are secluded and remote, and indisposed to be of\nservice to an alien sister. Roads are infrequent and most bridges have\nbroken down. No bridge has been repaired since the later seventeenth\ncentury, and no new bridge has been made since the decline and fall of\nthe Roman Empire. There are no shops at all. The scenery is magnificent\nbut precipitous, and many of the high roads are difficult to trace. And\nthere is rain. In Albania there is sometimes very heavy rain.\n\nYet in spite of these drawbacks they spent some splendid hours in their\nexploration of that wild lost country beyond the Adriatic headlands.\nThere was the approach to Cattaro for example, through an arm of the\nsea, amazingly beautiful on either shore, that wound its way into\nthe wild mountains and ended in a deep blue bay under the tremendous\ndeclivity of Montenegro. The quay, with its trees and lateen craft, ran\nalong under the towers and portcullised gate of the old Venetian wall,\nwithin clustered the town, and then the fortifications zigzagged up\nsteeply to a monstrous fantastic fortress perched upon a great mountain\nheadland that overhung the town. Behind it the rocks, slashed to and fro\nwith the road to Cettinje, continued to ascend into blue haze, upward\nand upward until they became a purple curtain that filled half the\nheavens. The paved still town was squalid by day, but in the evening it\nbecame theatrically incredible, with an outdoor cafe amidst flowers\nand creepers, a Hungarian military band, a rabble of promenaders like a\nstage chorus in gorgeous costumes and a great gibbous yellow moon.\n\nAnd there was Kroia, which Benham and Amanda saw first through the\nbranches of the great trees that bordered the broad green track they\nwere following. The town and its castle were poised at a tremendous\nheight, sunlit and brilliant against a sombre mass of storm cloud, over\nvast cliffs and ravines. Kroia continued to be beautiful through a steep\nlaborious approach up to the very place itself, a clustering group\nof houses and bazaars crowned with a tower and a minaret, and from a\npainted corridor upon this crest they had a wonderful view of the great\nseaward levels, and even far away the blue sea itself stretching between\nScutari and Durazzo. The eye fell in succession down the stages of a\nvast and various descent, on the bazaars and tall minarets of the town,\non jagged rocks and precipices, on slopes of oak forest and slopes of\nolive woods, on blue hills dropping away beyond blue hills to the coast.\nAnd behind them when they turned they saw great mountains, sullenly\nmagnificent, cleft into vast irregular masses, dense with woods below\nand grim and desolate above....\n\nThese were unforgettable scenes, and so too was the wild lonely valley\nthrough which they rode to Ochrida amidst walnut and chestnut trees and\nscattered rocks, and the first vision of that place itself, with its\nfertile levels dotted with sheep and cattle, its castle and clustering\nmosques, its spacious blue lake and the great mountains rising up\ntowards Olympus under the sun. And there was the first view of the\nblue Lake of Presba seen between silvery beech stems, and that too had\nOlympus in the far background, plain now and clear and unexpectedly\nsnowy. And there were midday moments when they sat and ate under vines\nand heard voices singing very pleasantly, and there were forest glades\nand forest tracks in a great variety of beauty with mountains appearing\nthrough their parted branches, there were ilex woods, chestnut woods,\nbeech woods, and there were strings of heavily-laden mules staggering up\ntorrent-worn tracks, and strings of blue-swathed mysterious-eyed women\nwith burthens on their heads passing silently, and white remote houses\nand ruins and deep gorges and precipices and ancient half-ruinous\nbridges over unruly streams. And if there was rain there was also\nthe ending of rain, rainbows, and the piercing of clouds by the sun's\nincandescence, and sunsets and the moon, first full, then new and then\ngrowing full again as the holiday wore on.\n\nThey found tolerable accommodation at Cattaro and at Cettinje and at a\nplace halfway between them. It was only when they had secured a guide\nand horses, and pushed on into the south-east of Montenegro that they\nbegan to realize the real difficulties of their journey. They aimed for\na place called Podgoritza, which had a partially justifiable reputation\nfor an inn, they missed the road and spent the night in the open beside\na fire, rolled in the blankets they had very fortunately bought in\nCettinje. They supped on biscuits and Benham's brandy flask. It\nchanced to be a fine night, and, drawn like moths by the fire, four\nheavily-armed mountaineers came out of nowhere, sat down beside Benham\nand Amanda, rolled cigarettes, achieved conversation in bad Italian\nthrough the muleteer and awaited refreshment. They approved of the\nbrandy highly, they finished it, and towards dawn warmed to song. They\ndid not sing badly, singing in chorus, but it appeared to Amanda\nthat the hour might have been better chosen. In the morning they were\nagreeably surprised to find one of the Englishmen was an Englishwoman,\nand followed every accessible detail of her toilette with great\ninterest. They were quite helpful about breakfast when the trouble was\nput to them; two vanished over a crest and reappeared with some sour\nmilk, a slabby kind of bread, goat's cheese young but hardened, and\ncoffee and the means of making coffee, and they joined spiritedly in the\nensuing meal. It ought to have been extraordinarily good fun, this camp\nunder the vast heavens and these wild visitors, but it was not such fun\nas it ought to have been because both Amanda and Benham were extremely\ncold, stiff, sleepy, grubby and cross, and when at last they were back\nin the way to Podgoritza and had parted, after some present-giving\nfrom their chance friends, they halted in a sunlit grassy place, rolled\nthemselves up in their blankets and recovered their arrears of sleep.\n\nPodgoritza was their first experience of a khan, those oriental\nsubstitutes for hotels, and it was a deceptively good khan, indeed it\nwas not a khan at all, it was an inn; it provided meals, it had a kind\nof bar, or at any rate a row of bottles and glasses, it possessed an\nupper floor with rooms, separate rooms, opening on to a gallery. The\nroom had no beds but it had a shelf about it on which Amanda and Benham\nrolled up in their blankets and slept. \"We can do this sort of thing all\nright,\" said Amanda and Benham. \"But we mustn't lose the way again.\"\n\n\"In Scutari,\" said Benham, \"we will get an extra horse and a tent.\"\n\nThe way presently became a lake and they reached Scutari by boat towards\nthe dawn of the next day....\n\nThe extra horse involved the addition of its owner, a small suspicious\nLatin Christian, to the company, and of another horse for him and\nan ugly almost hairless boy attendant. Moreover the British consul\nprevailed with Benham to accept the services of a picturesque Arnaut\nCAVASSE, complete with a rifle, knives, and other implements and the\nname of Giorgio. And as they got up into the highlands beyond Scutari\nthey began to realize the deceitfulness of Podgoritza and the real truth\nabout khans. Their next one they reached after a rainy evening, and\nit was a cavernous room with a floor of indurated mud and full of\neye-stinging wood-smoke and wind and the smell of beasts, unpartitioned,\nwith a weakly hostile custodian from whom no food could be got but a\nlittle goat's flesh and bread. The meat Giorgio stuck upon a skewer in\ngobbets like cats-meat and cooked before the fire. For drink there was\ncoffee and raw spirits. Against the wall in one corner was a slab of\nwood rather like the draining board in a scullery, and on this the\nguests were expected to sleep. The horses and the rest of the party\ncamped loosely about the adjacent corner after a bitter dispute upon\nsome unknown point between the horse owner and the custodian.\n\nAmanda and Benham were already rolled up on their slanting board like a\ncouple of chrysalids when other company began to arrive through the open\ndoor out of the moonlight, drawn thither by the report of a travelling\nEnglishwoman.\n\nThey were sturdy men in light coloured garments adorned ostentatiously\nwith weapons, they moved mysteriously about in the firelit darknesses\nand conversed in undertones with Giorgio. Giorgio seemed to have\nconsiderable powers of exposition and a gift for social organization.\nPresently he came to Benham and explained that raki was available and\nthat hospitality would do no harm; Benham and Amanda sat up and various\nromantic figures with splendid moustaches came forward and shook hands\nwith him, modestly ignoring Amanda. There was drinking, in which Benham\nshared, incomprehensible compliments, much ineffective saying of \"BUONA\nNOTTE,\" and at last Amanda and Benham counterfeited sleep. This seemed\nto remove a check on the conversation and a heated discussion in tense\nundertones went on, it seemed interminably.... Probably very few aspects\nof Benham and Amanda were ignored.... Towards morning the twanging of a\nstring proclaimed the arrival of a querulous-faced minstrel with a sort\nof embryonic one-stringed horse-headed fiddle, and after a brief parley\nsinging began, a long high-pitched solo. The fiddle squealed pitifully\nunder the persuasion of a semicircular bow. Two heads were lifted\nenquiringly.\n\nThe singer had taken up his position at their feet and faced them. It\nwas a compliment.\n\n\"OH!\" said Amanda, rolling over.\n\nThe soloist obliged with three songs, and then, just as day was\nbreaking, stopped abruptly and sprawled suddenly on the floor as if he\nhad been struck asleep. He was vocal even in his sleep. A cock in the\nfar corner began crowing and was answered by another outside....\n\nBut this does not give a full account of the animation of the khan.\n\"OH!\" said Amanda, rolling over again with the suddenness of accumulated\nanger.\n\n\"They're worse than in Scutari,\" said Benham, understanding her trouble\ninstantly.\n\n\"It isn't days and nights we are having,\" said Benham a few days later,\n\"it's days and nightmares.\"\n\nBut both he and Amanda had one quality in common. The deeper their\ndiscomfort the less possible it was to speak of turning back from the\nitinerary they had planned....\n\nThey met no robbers, though an excited little English Levantine in\nScutari had assured them they would do so and told a vivid story of a\nride to Ipek, a delay on the road due to a sudden inexplicable lameness\nof his horse after a halt for refreshment, a political discussion that\ndelayed him, his hurry through the still twilight to make up for lost\ntime, the coming on of night and the sudden silent apparition out of\nthe darkness of the woods about the road of a dozen armed men each\nprotruding a gun barrel. \"Sometimes they will wait for you at a ford\nor a broken bridge,\" he said. \"In the mountains they rob for arms. They\nassassinate the Turkish soldiers even. It is better to go unarmed unless\nyou mean to fight for it.... Have you got arms?\"\n\n\"Just a revolver,\" said Benham.\n\nBut it was after that that he closed with Giorgio.\n\nIf they found no robbers in Albania, they met soon enough with\nbloodshed. They came to a village where a friend of a friend of\nGiorgio's was discovered, and they slept at his house in preference to\nthe unclean and crowded khan. Here for the first time Amanda made the\nacquaintance of Albanian women and was carried off to the woman's region\nat the top of the house, permitted to wash, closely examined, shown\na baby and confided in as generously as gesture and some fragments of\nItalian would permit. Benham slept on a rug on the first floor in a\ncorner of honour beside the wood fire. There had been much confused\nconversation and some singing, he was dog-tired and slept heavily,\nand when presently he was awakened by piercing screams he sat up in a\ndarkness that seemed to belong neither to time nor place....\n\nNear his feet was an ashen glow that gave no light.\n\nHis first perplexity gave way to dismay at finding no Amanda by his\nside. \"Amanda!\" he cried....\n\nHer voice floated down through a chink in the floor above. \"What can it\nbe, Cheetah?\"\n\nThen: \"It's coming nearer.\"\n\nThe screaming continued, heart-rending, eviscerating shrieks. Benham,\nstill confused, lit a match. All the men about him were stirring or\nsitting up and listening, their faces showing distorted and ugly in the\nflicker of his light. \"CHE E?\" he tried. No one answered. Then one\nby one they stood up and went softly to the ladder that led to the\nstable-room below. Benham struck a second match and a third.\n\n\"Giorgio!\" he called.\n\nThe cavasse made an arresting gesture and followed discreetly and\nnoiselessly after the others, leaving Benham alone in the dark.\n\nBenham heard their shuffling patter, one after the other, down the\nladder, the sounds of a door being unbarred softly, and then no other\nsound but that incessant shrieking in the darkness.\n\nHad they gone out? Were they standing at the door looking out into the\nnight and listening?\n\nAmanda had found the chink and her voice sounded nearer.\n\n\"It's a woman,\" she said.\n\nThe shrieking came nearer and nearer, long, repeated, throat-tearing\nshrieks. Far off there was a great clamour of dogs. And there was\nanother sound, a whisper--?\n\n\"RAIN!\"\n\nThe shrieks seemed to turn into a side street and receded. The tension\nof listening relaxed. Men's voices sounded below in question and answer.\nDogs close at hand barked shortly and then stopped enquiringly.\n\nBenham seemed to himself to be sitting alone for an interminable time.\nHe lit another match and consulted his watch. It was four o'clock and\nnearly dawn....\n\nThen slowly and stumbling up the ladder the men began to return to\nBenham's room.\n\n\"Ask them what it is,\" urged Amanda.\n\nBut for a time not even Giorgio would understand Benham's questions.\nThere seemed to be a doubt whether he ought to know. The shrieking\napproached again and then receded. Giorgio came and stood, a vague\nthoughtful figure, by the embers of the fire. Explanation dropped from\nhim reluctantly. It was nothing. Some one had been killed: that was all.\nIt was a vendetta. A man had been missing overnight, and this morning\nhis brother who had been prowling and searching with some dogs had found\nhim, or rather his head. It was on this side of the ravine, thrown over\nfrom the other bank on which the body sprawled stiffly, wet through, and\nnow growing visible in the gathering daylight. Yes--the voice was the\nman's wife. It was raining hard.... There would be shrieking for nine\ndays. Yes, nine days. Confirmation with the fingers when Benham still\nfought against the facts. Her friends and relatives would come and\nshriek too. Two of the dead man's aunts were among the best keeners in\nthe whole land. They could keen marvellously. It was raining too hard\nto go on.... The road would be impossible in rain.... Yes it was very\nmelancholy. Her house was close at hand. Perhaps twenty or thirty women\nwould join her. It was impossible to go on until it had stopped raining.\nIt would be tiresome, but what could one do?...\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nAs they sat upon the parapet of a broken bridge on the road between\nElbassan and Ochrida Benham was moved to a dissertation upon the\ncondition of Albania and the politics of the Balkan peninsula.\n\n\"Here we are,\" he said, \"not a week from London, and you see the sort\nof life that men live when the forces of civilization fail. We have been\nclose to two murders--\"\n\n\"Two?\"\n\n\"That little crowd in the square at Scutari-- That was a murder. I\ndidn't tell you at the time.\"\n\n\"But I knew it was,\" said Amanda.\n\n\"And you see the filth of it all, the toiling discomfort of it all.\nThere is scarcely a house here in all the land that is not filthier\nand viler than the worst slum in London. No man ventures far from his\nvillage without arms, everywhere there is fear. The hills are impassable\nbecause of the shepherd's dogs. Over those hills a little while ago a\nstranger was torn to pieces by dogs--and partially eaten. Amanda, these\ndogs madden me. I shall let fly at the beasts. The infernal indignity\nof it! But that is by the way. You see how all this magnificent country\nlies waste with nothing but this crawling, ugly mockery of human life.\"\n\n\"They sing,\" said Amanda.\n\n\"Yes,\" said Benham and reflected, \"they do sing. I suppose singing is\nthe last thing left to men. When there is nothing else you can still sit\nabout and sing. Miners who have been buried in mines will sing, people\ngoing down in ships.\"\n\n\"The Sussex labourers don't sing,\" said Amanda. \"These people sing\nwell.\"\n\n\"They would probably sing as well if they were civilized. Even if they\ndidn't I shouldn't care. All the rest of their lives is muddle and\ncruelty and misery. Look at the women. There was that party of bent\ncreatures we met yesterday, carrying great bundles, carrying even\nthe men's cloaks and pipes, while their rascal husbands and brothers\nswaggered behind. Look at the cripples we have seen and the mutilated\nmen. If we have met one man without a nose, we have met a dozen. And\nstunted people. All these people are like evil schoolboys; they do\nnothing but malicious mischief; there is nothing adult about them but\ntheir voices; they are like the heroic dreams of young ruffians in a\npenitentiary. You saw that man at Scutari in the corner of the bazaar,\nthe gorgeous brute, you admired him--.\"\n\n\"The man with the gold inlaid pistols and the diamonds on his yataghan.\nHe wanted to show them to us.\"\n\n\"Yes. You let him see you admired him.\"\n\n\"I liked the things on his stall.\"\n\n\"Well, he has killed nearly thirty people.\"\n\n\"In duels?\"\n\n\"Good Lord! NO! Assassinations. His shoemaker annoyed him by sending in\na bill. He went to the man's stall, found him standing with his child\nin his arms and blew out his brains. He blundered against a passer-by in\nthe road and shot him. Those are his feats. Sometimes his pistols go off\nin the bazaar just by accident.\"\n\n\"Does nobody kill him?\"\n\n\"I wanted to,\" said Benham and became thoughtful for a time. \"I think I\nought to have made some sort of quarrel. But then as I am an Englishman\nhe might have hesitated. He would have funked a strange beast like me.\nAnd I couldn't have shot him if he had hesitated. And if he hadn't--\"\n\n\"But doesn't a blood feud come down on him?\"\n\n\"It only comes down on his family. The shoemaker's son thought the\nmatter over and squared accounts by putting the muzzle of a gun into the\nsmall of the back of our bully's uncle. It was easier that way.... You\nsee you're dealing with men of thirteen years old or thereabouts, the\nboy who doesn't grow up.\"\n\n\"But doesn't the law--?\"\n\n\"There's no law. Only custom and the Turkish tax collector.\n\n\"You see this is what men are where there is no power, no discipline,\nno ruler, no responsibility. This is a masterless world. This is pure\ndemocracy. This is the natural state of men. This is the world of the\nbully and the brigand and assassin, the world of the mud-pelter and\nbrawler, the world of the bent woman, the world of the flea and the\nfly, the open drain and the baying dog. This is what the British\nsentimentalist thinks a noble state for men.\"\n\n\"They fight for freedom.\"\n\n\"They fight among each other. There are their private feuds and their\nvillage feuds and above all that great feud religion. In Albania there\nis only one religion and that is hate. But there are three churches for\nthe better cultivation of hate and cruelty, the Latin, the Greek and the\nMahometan.\"\n\n\"But no one has ever conquered these people.\"\n\n\"Any one could, the Servians, the Bulgarians, the Greeks, the Italians,\nthe Austrians. Why, they can't even shoot! It's just the balance of\npower and all that foolery keeps this country a roadless wilderness.\nGood God, how I tire of it! These men who swagger and stink, their\nbrawling dogs, their greasy priests and dervishes, the down-at-heel\nsoldiers, the bribery and robbery, the cheating over the money....\"\n\nHe slipped off the parapet, too impatient to sit any longer, and began\nto pace up and down in the road.\n\n\"One marvels that no one comes to clear up this country, one itches to\nbe at the job, and then one realizes that before one can begin here, one\nmust get to work back there, where the fools and pedants of WELT POLITIK\nscheme mischief one against another. This country frets me. I can't see\nany fun in it, can't see the humour of it. And the people away there\nknow no better than to play off tribe against tribe, sect against sect,\none peasant prejudice against another. Over this pass the foolery grows\ngrimmer and viler. We shall come to where the Servian plots against\nthe Bulgarian and the Greek against both, and the Turk, with spasmodic\nmassacres and indulgences, broods over the brew. Every division is\nsubdivided. There are two sorts of Greek church, Exarchic, Patriarchic,\nboth teaching by threat and massacre. And there is no one, no one, with\nthe sense to over-ride all these squalid hostilities. All those fools\naway there in London and Vienna and St. Petersburg and Rome take sides\nas though these beastly tribes and leagues and superstitions meant\nanything but blank, black, damnable ignorance. One fool stands up for\nthe Catholic Albanians, another finds heroes in the Servians, another\ntalks of Brave Little Montenegro, or the Sturdy Bulgarian, or the Heroic\nTurk. There isn't a religion in the whole Balkan peninsula, there isn't\na tribal or national sentiment that deserves a moment's respect from\na sane man. They're things like niggers' nose-rings and Chinese secret\nsocieties; childish things, idiot things that have to go. Yet there is\nno one who will preach the only possible peace, which is the peace of\nthe world-state, the open conspiracy of all the sane men in the world\nagainst the things that break us up into wars and futilities. And here\nam I--who have the light--WANDERING! Just wandering!\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders and came to stare at the torrent under the\nbridge.\n\n\"You're getting ripe for London, Cheetah,\" said Amanda softly.\n\n\"I want somehow to get to work, to get my hands on definite things.\"\n\n\"How can we get back?\"\n\nShe had to repeat her question presently.\n\n\"We can go on. Over the hills is Ochrida and then over another pass is\nPresba, and from there we go down into Monastir and reach a railway and\nget back to the world of our own times again.\"\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nBut before they reached the world of their own times Macedonia was to\nshow them something grimmer than Albania.\n\nThey were riding through a sunlit walnut wood beyond Ochrida when they\ncame upon the thing.\n\nThe first they saw of it looked like a man lying asleep on a grassy\nbank. But he lay very still indeed, he did not look up, he did not stir\nas they passed, the pose of his hand was stiff, and when Benham glanced\nback at him, he stifled a little cry of horror. For this man had no face\nand the flies had been busy upon him....\n\nBenham caught Amanda's bridle so that she had to give her attention to\nher steed.\n\n\"Ahead!\" he said, \"Ahead! Look, a village!\"\n\n(Why the devil didn't they bury the man? Why? And that fool Giorgio and\nthe others were pulling up and beginning to chatter. After all she might\nlook back.)\n\nThrough the trees now they could see houses. He quickened his pace and\njerked Amanda's horse forward....\n\nBut the village was a still one. Not a dog barked.\n\nHere was an incredible village without even a dog!\n\nAnd then, then they saw some more people lying about. A woman lay in\na doorway. Near her was something muddy that might have been a child,\nbeyond were six men all spread out very neatly in a row with their faces\nto the sky.\n\n\"Cheetah!\" cried Amanda, with her voice going up. \"They've been killed.\nSome one has killed them.\"\n\nBenham halted beside her and stared stupidly. \"It's a band,\" he said.\n\"It's--propaganda. Greeks or Turks or Bulgarians.\"\n\n\"But their feet and hands are fastened! And--... WHAT HAVE THEY BEEN\nDOING TO THEM?...\"\n\n\"I want to kill,\" cried Benham. \"Oh! I want to kill people. Come on,\nAmanda! It blisters one's eyes. Come away. Come away! Come!\"\n\nHer face was white and her eyes terror-stricken. She obeyed him\nmechanically. She gave one last look at those bodies....\n\nDown the deep-rutted soil of the village street they clattered. They\ncame to houses that had been set on fire....\n\n\"What is that hanging from a tree?\" cried Amanda. \"Oh, oh!\"\n\n\"Come on....\"\n\nBehind them rode the others scared and hurrying.\n\nThe sunlight had become the light of hell. There was no air but horror.\nAcross Benham's skies these fly-blown trophies of devilry dangled\nmockingly in the place of God. He had no thought but to get away.\n\nPresently they encountered a detachment of Turkish soldiers, very greasy\nand ragged, with worn-out boots and yellow faces, toiling up the stony\nroad belatedly to the village. Amanda and Benham riding one behind\nthe other in a stricken silence passed this labouring column without a\ngesture, but presently they heard the commander stopping and questioning\nGiorgio....\n\nThen Giorgio and the others came clattering to overtake them.\n\nGiorgio was too full to wait for questions. He talked eagerly to\nBenham's silence.\n\nIt must have happened yesterday, he explained. They were\nBulgarians--traitors. They had been converted to the Patriarchists by\nthe Greeks--by a Greek band, that is to say. They had betrayed one\nof their own people. Now a Bulgarian band had descended upon\nthem. Bulgarian bands it seemed were always particularly rough on\nBulgarian-speaking Patriarchists....\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nThat night they slept in a dirty little room in a peasant's house in\nResnia, and in the middle of the night Amanda woke up with a start and\nheard Benham talking. He seemed to be sitting up as he talked. But he\nwas not talking to her and his voice sounded strange.\n\n\"Flies,\" he said, \"in the sunlight!\"\n\nHe was silent for a time and then he repeated the same words.\n\nThen suddenly he began to declaim. \"Oh! Brutes together. Apes. Apes with\nknives. Have they no lord, no master, to save them from such things?\nThis is the life of men when no man rules.... When no man rules.... Not\neven himself.... It is because we are idle, because we keep our wits\nslack and our wills weak that these poor devils live in hell. These\nthings happen here and everywhere when the hand that rules grows\nweak. Away in China now they are happening. Persia. Africa.... Russia\nstaggers. And I who should serve the law, I who should keep order,\nwander and make love.... My God! may I never forget! May I never forget!\nFlies in the sunlight! That man's face. And those six men!\n\n\"Grip the savage by the throat.\n\n\"The weak savage in the foreign office, the weak savage at the party\nheadquarters, feud and indolence and folly. It is all one world. This\nand that are all one thing. The spites of London and the mutilations\nof Macedonia. The maggots that eat men's faces and the maggots that rot\ntheir minds. Rot their minds. Rot their minds. Rot their minds....\"\n\nTo Amanda it sounded like delirium.\n\n\"CHEETAH!\" she said suddenly between remonstrance and a cry of terror.\n\nThe darkness suddenly became quite still. He did not move.\n\nShe was afraid. \"Cheetah!\" she said again.\n\n\"What is it, Amanda?\"\n\n\"I thought--. Are you all right?\"\n\n\"Quite.\"\n\n\"But do you feel well?\"\n\n\"I've got this cold I caught in Ochrida. I suppose I'm feverish.\nBut--yes, I'm well.\"\n\n\"You were talking.\"\n\nSilence for a time.\n\n\"I was thinking,\" he said.\n\n\"You talked.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said after another long pause.\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nThe next morning Benham had a pink spot on either cheek, his eyes were\nfeverishly bright, he would touch no food and instead of coffee he\nwanted water. \"In Monastir there will be a doctor,\" he said. \"Monastir\nis a big place. In Monastir I will see a doctor. I want a doctor.\"\n\nThey rode out of the village in the freshness before sunrise and up long\nhills, and sometimes they went in the shade of woods and sometimes in\na flooding sunshine. Benham now rode in front, preoccupied, intent,\nregardless of Amanda, a stranger, and she rode close behind him\nwondering.\n\n\"When you get to Monastir, young man,\" she told him, inaudibly, \"you\nwill go straight to bed and we'll see what has to be done with you.\"\n\n\"AMMALATO,\" said Giorgio confidentially, coming abreast of her.\n\n\"MEDICO IN MONASTIR,\" said Amanda.\n\n\"SI,--MOLTI MEDICI, MONASTIR,\" Giorgio agreed.\n\nThen came the inevitable dogs, big white brutes, three in full cry\ncharging hard at Benham and a younger less enterprising beast running\nalong the high bank above yapping and making feints to descend.\n\nThe goatherd, reclining under the shadow of a rock, awaited Benham's\nembarrassment with an indolent malice.\n\n\"You UNCIVILIZED Beasts!\" cried Benham, and before Amanda could realize\nwhat he was up to, she heard the crack of his revolver and saw a puff\nof blue smoke drift away above his right shoulder. The foremost beast\nrolled over and the goatherd had sprung to his feet. He shouted with\nsomething between anger and dismay as Benham, regardless of the fact\nthat the other dogs had turned and were running back, let fly a second\ntime. Then the goatherd had clutched at the gun that lay on the grass\nnear at hand, Giorgio was bawling in noisy remonstrance and also getting\nready to shoot, and the horse-owner and his boy were clattering back\nto a position of neutrality up the stony road. \"BANG!\" came a flight\nof lead within a yard of Benham, and then the goatherd was in retreat\nbehind a rock and Giorgio was shouting \"AVANTI, AVANTI!\" to Amanda.\n\nShe grasped his intention and in another moment she had Benham's horse\nby the bridle and was leading the retreat. Giorgio followed close,\ndriving the two baggage mules before him.\n\n\"I am tired of dogs,\" Benham said. \"Tired to death of dogs. All savage\ndogs must be shot. All through the world. I am tired--\"\n\nTheir road carried them down through the rocky pass and then up a long\nslope in the open. Far away on the left they saw the goatherd running\nand shouting and other armed goatherds appearing among the rocks. Behind\nthem the horse-owner and his boy came riding headlong across the zone of\ndanger.\n\n\"Dogs must be shot,\" said Benham, exalted. \"Dogs must be shot.\"\n\n\"Unless they are GOOD dogs,\" said Amanda, keeping beside him with an eye\non his revolver.\n\n\"Unless they are good dogs to every one,\" said Benham.\n\nThey rushed along the road in a turbulent dusty huddle of horses and\nmules and riders. The horse-owner, voluble in Albanian, was trying\nto get past them. His boy pressed behind him. Giorgio in the rear had\nunslung his rifle and got it across the front of his saddle. Far\naway they heard the sound of a shot, and a kind of shudder in the air\noverhead witnessed to the flight of the bullet. They crested a rise and\nsuddenly between the tree boughs Monastir was in view, a wide stretch of\nwhite town, with many cypress and plane trees, a winding river with many\nwooden bridges, clustering minarets of pink and white, a hilly cemetery,\nand scattered patches of soldiers' tents like some queer white crop to\nsupplement its extensive barracks.\n\nAs they hurried down towards this city of refuge a long string of mules\nburthened with great bales of green stuff appeared upon a convergent\ntrack to the left. Besides the customary muleteers there were, by way of\nan escort, a couple of tattered Turkish soldiers. All these men watched\nthe headlong approach of Benham's party with apprehensive inquiry.\nGiorgio shouted some sort of information that made the soldiers brighten\nup and stare up the hill, and set the muleteers whacking and shouting at\ntheir convoy. It struck Amanda that Giorgio must be telling lies about\na Bulgarian band. In another moment Benham and Amanda found themselves\nswimming in a torrent of mules. Presently they overtook a small flock of\nfortunately nimble sheep, and picked up several dogs, dogs that happily\ndisregarded Benham in the general confusion. They also comprehended a\nsmall springless cart, two old women with bundles and an elderly Greek\npriest, before their dusty, barking, shouting cavalcade reached the\noutskirts of Monastir. The two soldiers had halted behind to cover the\nretreat.\n\nBenham's ghastly face was now bedewed with sweat and he swayed in his\nsaddle as he rode. \"This is NOT civilization, Amanda,\" he said, \"this is\nNOT civilization.\"\n\nAnd then suddenly with extraordinary pathos:\n\n\"Oh! I want to go to BED! I want to go to BED! A bed with sheets....\"\n\nTo ride into Monastir is to ride into a maze. The streets go nowhere in\nparticular. At least that was the effect on Amanda and Benham. It was\nas if Monastir too had a temperature and was slightly delirious. But at\nlast they found an hotel--quite a civilized hotel....\n\nThe doctor in Monastir was an Armenian with an ambition that outran his\ncapacity to speak English. He had evidently studied the language chiefly\nfrom books. He thought THESE was pronounced \"theser\" and THOSE was\npronounced \"thoser,\" and that every English sentence should be taken at\na rush. He diagnosed Benham's complaint in various languages and failed\nto make his meaning clear to Amanda. One combination of words he clung\nto obstinately, having clearly the utmost faith in its expressiveness.\nTo Amanda it sounded like, \"May, Ah! Slays,\" and it seemed to her that\nhe sought to intimate a probable fatal termination of Benham's fever.\nBut it was clear that the doctor was not satisfied that she understood.\nHe came again with a queer little worn book, a parallel vocabulary of\nhalf-a-dozen European languages.\n\nHe turned over the pages and pointed to a word. \"May! Ah! Slays!\" he\nrepeated, reproachfully, almost bitterly.\n\n\"Oh, MEASLES!\" cried Amanda....\n\nSo the spirited honeymoon passed its zenith.\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nThe Benhams went as soon as possible down to Smyrna and thence by way\nof Uskub tortuously back to Italy. They recuperated at the best hotel\nof Locarno in golden November weather, and just before Christmas they\nturned their faces back to England.\n\nBenham's plans were comprehensive but entirely vague; Amanda had not so\nmuch plans as intentions....\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FIFTH ~~ THE ASSIZE OF JEALOUSY\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nIt was very manifest in the disorder of papers amidst which White spent\nso many evenings of interested perplexity before this novel began to be\nwritten that Benham had never made any systematic attempt at editing\nor revising his accumulation at all. There were not only overlapping\ndocuments, in which he had returned again to old ideas and restated\nthem in the light of fresh facts and an apparent unconsciousness of his\nearlier effort, but there were mutually destructive papers, new views\nquite ousting the old had been tossed in upon the old, and the very\ndefinition of the second limitation, as it had first presented itself to\nthe writer, had been abandoned. To begin with, this second division\nhad been labelled \"Sex,\" in places the heading remained, no\neffective substitute had been chosen for some time, but there was\na closely-written memorandum, very much erased and written over and\namended, which showed Benham's early dissatisfaction with that crude\nrendering of what he had in mind. This memorandum was tacked to an\ninterrupted fragment of autobiography, a manuscript soliloquy in which\nBenham had been discussing his married life.\n\n\"It was not until I had been married for the better part of a year, and\nhad spent more than six months in London, that I faced the plain issue\nbetween the aims I had set before myself and the claims and immediate\nnecessities of my personal life. For all that time I struggled not so\nmuch to reconcile them as to serve them simultaneously....\"\n\nAt that the autobiography stopped short, and the intercalary note began.\n\nThis intercalary note ran as follows:\n\n\"I suppose a mind of my sort cannot help but tend towards\nsimplification, towards making all life turn upon some one dominant\nidea, complex perhaps in its reality but reducible at last to one\nconsistent simple statement, a dominant idea which is essential as\nnothing else is essential, which makes and sustains and justifies. This\nis perhaps the innate disposition of the human mind, at least of the\nEuropean mind--for I have some doubts about the Chinese. Theology\ndrives obstinately towards an ultimate unity in God, science towards\nan ultimate unity in law, towards a fundamental element and a universal\nmaterial truth from which all material truths evolve, and in matters of\nconduct there is the same tendency to refer to a universal moral law.\nNow this may be a simplification due to the need of the human mind to\ncomprehend, and its inability to do so until the load is lightened by\nneglecting factors. William James has suggested that on account of this,\ntheology may be obstinately working away from the truth, that the truth\nmay be that there are several or many in compatible and incommensurable\ngods; science, in the same search for unity, may follow divergent\nmethods of inquiry into ultimately uninterchangeable generalizations;\nand there may be not only not one universal moral law, but no effective\nreconciliation of the various rights and duties of a single individual.\nAt any rate I find myself doubtful to this day about my own personal\nsystems of right and wrong. I can never get all my life into one focus.\nIt is exactly like examining a rather thick section with a microscope of\nsmall penetration; sometimes one level is clear and the rest foggy and\nmonstrous, and sometimes another.\n\n\"Now the ruling ME, I do not doubt, is the man who has set his face\nto this research after aristocracy, and from the standpoint of this\nresearch it is my duty to subordinate all other considerations to\nthis work of clearing up the conception of rule and nobility in human\naffairs. This is my aristocratic self. What I did not grasp for a long\ntime, and which now grows clearer and clearer to me, is firstly that\nthis aristocratic self is not the whole of me, it has absolutely nothing\nto do with a pain in my ear or in my heart, with a scar on my hand or my\nmemory, and secondly that it is not altogether mine. Whatever knowledge\nI have of the quality of science, whatever will I have towards right,\nis of it; but if from without, from the reasoning or demonstration or\nreproof of some one else, there comes to me clear knowledge, clarified\nwill, that also is as it were a part of my aristocratic self coming\nhome to me from the outside. How often have I not found my own mind\nin Prothero after I have failed to find it in myself? It is, to be\nparadoxical, my impersonal personality, this Being that I have in common\nwith all scientific-spirited and aristocratic-spirited men. This it is\nthat I am trying to get clear from the great limitations of humanity.\nWhen I assert a truth for the sake of truth to my own discomfort or\ninjury, there again is this incompatibility of the aristocratic self and\nthe accepted, confused, conglomerate self of the unanalyzed man. The two\nhave a separate system of obligations. One's affections, compounded\nas they are in the strangest way of physical reactions and emotional\nassociations, one's implicit pledges to particular people, one's\ninvoluntary reactions, one's pride and jealousy, all that one might call\nthe dramatic side of one's life, may be in conflict with the definitely\nseen rightnesses of one's higher use....\"\n\nThe writing changed at this point.\n\n\"All this seems to me at once as old as the hills and too new to be\ntrue. This is like the conflict of the Superior Man of Confucius to\ncontrol himself, it is like the Christian battle of the spirit with the\nflesh, it savours of that eternal wrangle between the general and the\nparticular which is metaphysics, it was for this aristocratic self, for\nrighteousness' sake, that men have hungered and thirsted, and on this\npoint men have left father and mother and child and wife and followed\nafter salvation. This world-wide, ever-returning antagonism has filled\nthe world in every age with hermits and lamas, recluses and teachers,\ndevoted and segregated lives. It is a perpetual effort to get above the\nsimplicity of barbarism. Whenever men have emerged from the primitive\nbarbarism of the farm and the tribe, then straightway there has emerged\nthis conception of a specialized life a little lifted off the earth;\noften, for the sake of freedom, celibate, usually disciplined, sometimes\ndirected, having a generalized aim, beyond personal successes and bodily\ndesires. So it is that the philosopher, the scientifically concentrated\nman, has appeared, often, I admit, quite ridiculously at first, setting\nout upon the long journey that will end only when the philosopher is\nking....\n\n\"At first I called my Second Limitation, Sex. But from the outset I\nmeant more than mere sexual desire, lust and lustful imaginings, more\nthan personal reactions to beauty and spirited living, more even than\nwhat is called love. On the one hand I had in mind many appetites that\nare not sexual yet turn to bodily pleasure, and on the other there are\nelements of pride arising out of sex and passing into other regions,\nall the elements of rivalry for example, that have strained my first\ndefinition to the utmost. And I see now that this Second Limitation as I\nfirst imagined it spreads out without any definite boundary, to include\none's rivalries with old schoolfellows, for example, one's generosities\nto beggars and dependents, one's desire to avenge an injured friend,\none's point of honour, one's regard for the good opinion of an aunt and\none's concern for the health of a pet cat. All these things may enrich,\nbut they may also impede and limit the aristocratic scheme. I thought\nfor a time I would call this ill-defined and miscellaneous wilderness of\nlimitation the Personal Life. But at last I have decided to divide this\nvast territory of difficulties into two subdivisions and make one of\nthese Indulgence, meaning thereby pleasurable indulgence of sense or\nfeeling, and the other a great mass of self-regarding motives that\nwill go with a little stretching under the heading of Jealousy. I\nadmit motives are continually playing across the boundary of these\ntwo divisions, I should find it difficult to argue a case for my\nclassification, but in practice these two groupings have a quite\ndefinite meaning for me. There is pride in the latter group of impulses\nand not in the former; the former are always a little apologetic. Fear,\nIndulgence, Jealousy, these are the First Three Limitations of the soul\nof man. And the greatest of these is Jealousy, because it can use pride.\nOver them the Life Aristocratic, as I conceive it, marches to its end.\nIt saves itself for the truth rather than sacrifices itself romantically\nfor a friend. It justifies vivisection if thereby knowledge is won for\never. It upholds that Brutus who killed his sons. It forbids devotion to\nwomen, courts of love and all such decay of the chivalrous idea. And it\nresigns--so many things that no common Man of Spirit will resign. Its\nintention transcends these things. Over all the world it would maintain\njustice, order, a noble peace, and it would do this without indignation,\nwithout resentment, without mawkish tenderness or individualized\nenthusiasm or any queen of beauty. It is of a cold austere quality,\ncommanding sometimes admiration but having small hold upon the\naffections of men. So that it is among its foremost distinctions that\nits heart is steeled....\"\n\nThere this odd fragment ended and White was left to resume the\ninterrupted autobiography.\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nWhat moods, what passions, what nights of despair and gathering storms\nof anger, what sudden cruelties and amazing tendernesses are buried\nand hidden and implied in every love story! What a waste is there of\nexquisite things! So each spring sees a million glorious beginnings, a\nsunlit heaven in every opening leaf, warm perfection in every stirring\negg, hope and fear and beauty beyond computation in every forest tree;\nand in the autumn before the snows come they have all gone, of all\nthat incalculable abundance of life, of all that hope and adventure,\nexcitement and deliciousness, there is scarcely more to be found than\na soiled twig, a dirty seed, a dead leaf, black mould or a rotting\nfeather....\n\nWhite held the ten or twelve pencilled pages that told how Benham and\nAmanda drifted into antagonism and estrangement and as he held it he\nthought of the laughter and delight they must have had together, the\nexquisite excitements of her eye, the racing colour of her cheek, the\ngleams of light upon her skin, the flashes of wit between them, the\nsense of discovery, the high rare paths they had followed, the pools in\nwhich they had swum together. And now it was all gone into nothingness,\nthere was nothing left of it, nothing at all, but just those sheets of\nstatement, and it may be, stored away in one single mind, like things\nforgotten in an attic, a few neglected faded memories....\n\nAnd even those few sheets of statement were more than most love leaves\nbehind it. For a time White would not read them. They lay neglected on\nhis knee as he sat back in Benham's most comfortable chair and enjoyed\nan entirely beautiful melancholy.\n\nWhite too had seen and mourned the spring.\n\nIndeed, poor dear! he had seen and mourned several springs....\n\nWith a sigh he took up the manuscript and read Benham's desiccated story\nof intellectual estrangement, and how in the end he had decided to\nleave his wife and go out alone upon that journey of inquiry he had been\nplanning when first he met her.\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nAmanda had come back to England in a state of extravagantly vigorous\nwomanhood. Benham's illness, though it lasted only two or three\nweeks, gave her a sense of power and leadership for which she had been\nstruggling instinctively ever since they came together. For a time at\nLocarno he was lax-minded and indolent, and in that time she formed her\nbright and limited plans for London. Benham had no plans as yet but\nonly a sense of divergence, as though he was being pulled in opposite\ndirections by two irresistible forces. To her it was plain that he\nneeded occupation, some distinguished occupation, and she could imagine\nnothing better for him than a political career. She perceived he had\npersonality, that he stood out among men so that his very silences were\neffective. She loved him immensely, and she had tremendous ambitions for\nhim and through him.\n\nAnd also London, the very thought of London, filled her with appetite.\nHer soul thirsted for London. It was like some enormous juicy fruit\nwaiting for her pretty white teeth, a place almost large enough to give\nher avidity the sense of enough. She felt it waiting for her, household,\nservants, a carriage, shops and the jolly delight of buying and\npossessing things, the opera, first-nights, picture exhibitions, great\ndinner-parties, brilliant lunch parties, crowds seen from a point\nof vantage, the carriage in a long string of fine carriages with the\nlamplit multitude peering, Amanda in a thousand bright settings, in a\nthousand various dresses. She had had love; it had been glorious, it\nwas still glorious, but her love-making became now at times almost\nperfunctory in the contemplation of these approaching delights and\nsplendours and excitements.\n\nShe knew, indeed, that ideas were at work in Benham's head; but she\nwas a realist. She did not see why ideas should stand in the way of a\ncareer. Ideas are a brightness, the good looks of the mind. One talks\nideas, but THE THING THAT IS, IS THE THING THAT IS. And though she\nbelieved that Benham had a certain strength of character of his own, she\nhad that sort of confidence in his love for her and in the power of her\nendearments that has in it the assurance of a faint contempt. She had\nmingled pride and sense in the glorious realization of the power over\nhim that her wit and beauty gave her. She had held him faint with her\ndivinity, intoxicated with the pride of her complete possession, and she\ndid not dream that the moment when he should see clearly that she could\ndeliberately use these ultimate delights to rule and influence him,\nwould be the end of their splendour and her power. Her nature, which\nwas just a nest of vigorous appetites, was incapable of suspecting his\ngathering disillusionment until it burst upon her.\n\nNow with her attention set upon London ahead he could observe her.\nIn the beginning he had never seemed to be observing her at all, they\ndazzled one another; it seemed extraordinary now to him to note how much\nhe had been able to disregard. There were countless times still when he\nwould have dropped his observation and resumed that mutual exaltation\nvery gladly, but always now other things possessed her mind....\n\nThere was still an immense pleasure for him in her vigour; there was\nsomething delightful in her pounce, even when she was pouncing on things\nsuperficial, vulgar or destructive. She made him understand and share\nthe excitement of a big night at the opera, the glitter and prettiness\nof a smart restaurant, the clustering little acute adventures of a great\nreception of gay people, just as she had already made him understand and\nsympathize with dogs. She picked up the art world where he had laid\nit down, and she forced him to feel dense and slow before he rebelled\nagainst her multitudinous enthusiasms and admirations. South Harting had\nhad its little group of artistic people; it is not one of your sleepy\nvillages, and she slipped back at once into the movement. Those were\nthe great days of John, the days before the Post Impressionist outbreak.\nJohn, Orpen, Tonks, she bought them with vigour. Artistic circles began\nto revolve about her. Very rapidly she was in possession.... And among\nother desirable things she had, it seemed, pounced upon and captured\nLady Marayne.\n\nAt any rate it was clear that that awful hostile silence and aloofness\nwas to end. Benham never quite mastered how it was done. But Amanda\nhad gone in one morning to Desborough Street, very sweetly and\nchastely dressed, had abased herself and announced a possible (though\nsubsequently disproved) grandchild. And she had appreciated the little\nlady so highly and openly, she had so instantly caught and reproduced\nher tone, that her success, though only temporary in its completeness,\nwas immediate. In the afternoon Benham was amazed by the apparition of\nhis mother amidst the scattered unsettled furnishings of the new home\nAmanda had chosen in Lancaster Gate. He was in the hall, the door stood\nopen awaiting packing-cases from a van without. In the open doorway she\nshone, looking the smallest of dainty things. There was no effect of her\ncoming but only of her having arrived there, as a little blue butterfly\nwill suddenly alight on a flower.\n\n\"Well, Poff!\" said Lady Marayne, ignoring abysses, \"What are you up to\nnow, Poff? Come and embrace me....\"\n\n\"No, not so,\" she said, \"stiffest of sons....\"\n\nShe laid hold of his ears in the old fashion and kissed one eye.\n\n\"Congratulations, dear little Poff. Oh! congratulations! In heaps. I'm\nso GLAD.\"\n\nNow what was that for?\n\nAnd then Amanda came out upon the landing upstairs, saw the encounter\nwith an involuntary cry of joy, and came downstairs with arms wide open.\nIt was the first intimation he had of their previous meeting. He was for\nsome minutes a stunned, entirely inadequate Benham....\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nAt first Amanda knew nobody in London, except a few people in the\nHampstead Garden suburb that she had not the slightest wish to know, and\nthen very quickly she seemed to know quite a lot of people. The artistic\ncircle brought in people, Lady Marayne brought in people; they spread.\nIt was manifest the Benhams were a very bright young couple; he would\ncertainly do something considerable presently, and she was bright and\ndaring, jolly to look at and excellent fun, and, when you came to talk\nto her, astonishingly well informed. They passed from one hostess's hand\nto another: they reciprocated. The Clynes people and the Rushtones took\nher up; Mr. Evesham was amused by her, Lady Beach Mandarin proclaimed\nher charm like a trumpet, the Young Liberal people made jealous\nadvances, Lord Moggeridge found she listened well, she lit one of the\nbrightest weekend parties Lady Marayne had ever gathered at Chexington.\nAnd her descriptions of recent danger and adventure in Albania not\nonly entertained her hearers but gave her just that flavour of personal\ncourage which completes the fascination of a young woman. People in the\ngaps of a halting dinner-table conversation would ask: \"Have you met\nMrs. Benham?\"\n\nMeanwhile Benham appeared to be talking. A smiling and successful young\nwoman, who a year ago had been nothing more than a leggy girl with a\ngood lot of miscellaneous reading in her head, and vaguely engaged, or\nat least friendly to the pitch of engagement, to Mr. Rathbone-Sanders,\nmay be forgiven if in the full tide of her success she does not\naltogether grasp the intention of her husband's discourse. It seemed to\nher that he was obsessed by a responsibility for civilization and the\nidea that he was aristocratic. (Secretly she was inclined to doubt\nwhether he was justified in calling himself aristocratic; at the best\nhis mother was county-stuff; but still if he did there was no great\nharm in it nowadays.) Clearly his line was Tory-Democracy, social reform\nthrough the House of Lords and friendly intimacy with the more spirited\nyoung peers. And it was only very slowly and reluctantly that she\nwas forced to abandon this satisfactory solution of his problem. She\nreproduced all the equipment and comforts of his Finacue Street study in\ntheir new home, she declared constantly that she would rather forego\nany old social thing than interfere with his work, she never made him\ngo anywhere with her without first asking if his work permitted it. To\nrelieve him of the burthen of such social attentions she even made a fag\nor so. The making of fags out of manifestly stricken men, the keeping\nof tamed and hopeless admirers, seemed to her to be the most natural and\nreasonable of feminine privileges. They did their useful little services\nuntil it pleased the Lord Cheetah to come to his own. That was how she\nput it....\n\nBut at last he was talking to her in tones that could no longer be\nignored. He was manifestly losing his temper with her. There was a\nnovel austerity in his voice and a peculiar whiteness about his face on\ncertain occasions that lingered in her memory.\n\nHe was indeed making elaborate explanations. He said that what he wanted\nto do was to understand \"the collective life of the world,\" and that\nthis was not to be done in a West-End study. He had an extraordinary\ncontempt, it seemed, for both sides in the drama of British politics. He\nhad extravagant ideas of beginning in some much more fundamental way.\nHe wanted to understand this \"collective life of the world,\" because\nultimately he wanted to help control it. (Was there ever such nonsense?)\nThe practical side of this was serious enough, however; he was back at\nhis old idea of going round the earth. Later on that might be rather\na jolly thing to do, but not until they had struck root a little more\nsurely in London.\n\nAnd then with amazement, with incredulity, with indignation, she began\nto realize that he was proposing to go off by himself upon this vague\nextravagant research, that all this work she had been doing to make\na social place for him in London was as nothing to him, that he was\nthinking of himself as separable from her....\n\n\"But, Cheetah! How can you leave your spotless leopard? You would howl\nin the lonely jungle!\"\n\n\"Possibly I shall. But I am going.\"\n\n\"Then I shall come.\"\n\n\"No.\" He considered her reasons. \"You see you are not interested.\"\n\n\"But I am.\"\n\n\"Not as I am. You would turn it all into a jolly holiday. You don't want\nto see things as I want to do. You want romance. All the world is a show\nfor you. As a show I can't endure it. I want to lay hands on it.\"\n\n\"But, Cheetah!\" she said, \"this is separation.\"\n\n\"You will have your life here. And I shall come back.\"\n\n\"But, Cheetah! How can we be separated?\"\n\n\"We are separated,\" he said.\n\nHer eyes became round with astonishment. Then her face puckered.\n\n\"Cheetah!\" she cried in a voice of soft distress, \"I love you. What do\nyou mean?\"\n\nAnd she staggered forward, tear-blinded, and felt for his neck and\nshoulders, so that she might weep in his arms....\n\n\n\n5\n\n\n\"Don't say we are separated,\" she whispered, putting her still wet face\nclose to his.\n\n\"No. We're mates,\" he answered softly, with his arm about her.\n\n\"How could we ever keep away from each uvver?\" she whispered.\n\nHe was silent.\n\n\"How COULD we?\"\n\nHe answered aloud. \"Amanda,\" he said, \"I mean to go round the world.\"\n\nShe disentangled herself from his arm and sat up beside him.\n\n\"What is to become of me,\" she asked suddenly in a voice of despair,\n\"while you go round the world? If you desert me in London,\" she said,\n\"if you shame me by deserting me in London-- If you leave me, I will\nnever forgive you, Cheetah! Never.\" Then in an almost breathless voice,\nand as if she spoke to herself, \"Never in all my days.\"\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nIt was after that that Amanda began to talk about children. There was\nnothing involuntary about Amanda. \"Soon,\" she said, \"we must begin to\nthink of children. Not just now, but a little later. It's good to travel\nand have our fun, but life is unreal until there are children in the\nbackground. No woman is really content until she is a mother....\" And\nfor nearly a fortnight nothing more was said about that solitary journey\nround the world.\n\nBut children were not the only new topic in Amanda's talk. She set\nherself with an ingenious subtlety to remind her husband that there\nwere other men in the world. The convenient fags, sometimes a little\nembarrassed, found their inobtrusive services being brought into the\nlight before Benham's eyes. Most of them were much older men than\nhimself, elderly philanderers of whom it seemed to him no sane man need\nbe jealous, men often of forty or more, but one was a contemporary, Sir\nPhilip Easton, a man with a touch of Spanish blood and a suggestion of\nSpanish fire, who quite manifestly was very much in love with Amanda and\nof whom she spoke with a slight perceptible difference of manner that\nmade Benham faintly uneasy. He was ashamed of the feeling. Easton it\nseemed was a man of a peculiarly fine honour, so that Amanda could trust\nherself with him to an extent that would have been inadvisable with men\nof a commoner substance, and he had a gift of understanding and sympathy\nthat was almost feminine; he could cheer one up when one was lonely and\ndespondent. For Amanda was so methodical in the arrangement of her time\nthat even in the full rush of a London season she could find an hour\nnow and then for being lonely and despondent. And he was a liberal and\nunderstanding purchaser of the ascendant painters; he understood\nthat side of Amanda's interests, a side upon which Benham was notably\ndeficient....\n\n\"Amanda seems to like that dark boy, Poff; what is his name?--Sir Philip\nEaston?\" said Lady Marayne.\n\nBenham looked at her with a slightly hostile intelligence, and said\nnothing.\n\n\"When a man takes a wife, he has to keep her,\" said Lady Marayne.\n\n\"No,\" said Benham after consideration. \"I don't intend to be a\nwife-herd.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Wife-herd--same as goat-herd.\"\n\n\"Coarse, you are sometimes, Poff--nowadays.\"\n\n\"It's exactly what I mean. I can understand the kind of curator's\ninterest an Oriental finds in shepherding a large establishment, but\nto spend my days looking after one person who ought to be able to look\nafter herself--\"\n\n\"She's very young.\"\n\n\"She's quite grown up. Anyhow I'm not a moral nursemaid.\"\n\n\"If you leave her about and go abroad--\"\n\n\"Has she been talking to you, mother?\"\n\n\"The thing shows.\"\n\n\"But about my going abroad?\"\n\n\"She said something, my little Poff.\"\n\nLady Marayne suddenly perceived that beneath Benham's indifference\nwas something strung very tight, as though he had been thinking\ninordinately. He weighed his words before he spoke again. \"If Amanda\nchooses to threaten me with a sort of conditional infidelity, I don't\nsee that it ought to change the plans I have made for my life....\"\n\n\n\n7\n\n\n\"No aristocrat has any right to be jealous,\" Benham wrote. \"If he\nchances to be mated with a woman who does not see his vision or\nnaturally go his way, he has no right to expect her, much less to compel\nher to go his way. What is the use of dragging an unwilling companion\nthrough morasses of uncongenial thought to unsought ends? What is the\nuse of dragging even a willing pretender, who has no inherent will to\nseek and live the aristocratic life?\n\n\"But that does not excuse him from obedience to his own call....\"\n\nHe wrote that very early in his examination of the Third Limitation.\nAlready he had thought out and judged Amanda. The very charm of her,\nthe sweetness, the nearness and magic of her, was making him more grimly\nresolute to break away. All the elaborate process of thinking her\nover had gone on behind the mask of his silences while she had been\npreoccupied with her housing and establishment in London; it was with a\nsense of extraordinary injustice, of having had a march stolen upon her,\nof being unfairly trapped, that Amanda found herself faced by foregone\nconclusions. He was ready now even with the details of his project. She\nshould go on with her life in London exactly as she had planned it. He\nwould take fifteen hundred a year for himself and all the rest she might\nspend without check or stint as it pleased her. He was going round the\nworld for one or two years. It was even possible he would not go alone.\nThere was a man at Cambridge he might persuade to come with him, a don\ncalled Prothero who was peculiarly useful in helping him to hammer out\nhis ideas....\n\nTo her it became commandingly necessary that none of these things should\nhappen.\n\nShe tried to play upon his jealousy, but her quick instinct speedily\ntold her that this only hardened his heart. She perceived that she must\nmake a softer appeal. Now of a set intention she began to revive and\nimitate the spontaneous passion of the honeymoon; she perceived for the\nfirst time clearly how wise and righteous a thing it is for a woman to\nbear a child. \"He cannot go if I am going to have a child,\" she told\nherself. But that would mean illness, and for illness in herself or\nothers Amanda had the intense disgust natural to her youth. Yet even\nillness would be better than this intolerable publication of her\nhusband's ability to leave her side....\n\nShe had a wonderful facility of enthusiasm and she set herself forthwith\nto cultivate a philoprogenitive ambition, to communicate it to him. Her\ndread of illness disappeared; her desire for offspring grew.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I want to have children, but I must go round the world\nnone the less.\"\n\nShe argued with all the concentrated subtlety of her fine keen mind. She\nargued with persistence and repetition. And then suddenly so that she\nwas astonished at herself, there came a moment when she ceased to argue.\n\nShe stood in the dusk in a window that looked out upon the park, and she\nwas now so intent upon her purpose as to be still and self-forgetful;\nshe was dressed in a dinner-dress of white and pale green, that set off\nher slim erect body and the strong clear lines of her neck and shoulders\nvery beautifully, some greenish stones caught a light from without and\nflashed soft whispering gleams from amidst the misty darkness of her\nhair. She was going to Lady Marayne and the opera, and he was bound for\na dinner at the House with some young Liberals at which he was to meet\ntwo representative Indians with a grievance from Bengal. Husband and\nwife had but a few moments together. She asked about his company and he\ntold her.\n\n\"They will tell you about India.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nShe stood for a moment looking out across the lights and the dark green\ntrees, and then she turned to him.\n\n\"Why cannot I come with you?\" she asked with sudden passion. \"Why cannot\nI see the things you want to see?\"\n\n\"I tell you you are not interested. You would only be interested through\nme. That would not help me. I should just be dealing out my premature\nideas to you. If you cared as I care, if you wanted to know as I want to\nknow, it would be different. But you don't. It isn't your fault that\nyou don't. It happens so. And there is no good in forced interest, in\nprescribed discovery.\"\n\n\"Cheetah,\" she asked, \"what is it that you want to know--that I don't\ncare for?\"\n\n\"I want to know about the world. I want to rule the world.\"\n\n\"So do I.\"\n\n\"No, you want to have the world.\"\n\n\"Isn't it the same?\"\n\n\"No. You're a greedier thing than I am, you Black Leopard you--standing\nthere in the dusk. You're a stronger thing. Don't you know you're\nstronger? When I am with you, you carry your point, because you are more\nconcentrated, more definite, less scrupulous. When you run beside me\nyou push me out of my path.... You've made me afraid of you.... And so\nI won't go with you, Leopard. I go alone. It isn't because I don't love\nyou. I love you too well. It isn't because you aren't beautiful and\nwonderful....\"\n\n\"But, Cheetah! nevertheless you care more for this that you want than\nyou care for me.\"\n\nBenham thought of it. \"I suppose I do,\" he said.\n\n\"What is it that you want? Still I don't understand.\"\n\nHer voice had the break of one who would keep reasonable in spite of\npain.\n\n\"I ought to tell you.\"\n\n\"Yes, you ought to tell me.\"\n\n\"I wonder if I can tell you,\" he said very thoughtfully, and rested his\nhands on his hips. \"I shall seem ridiculous to you.\"\n\n\"You ought to tell me.\"\n\n\"I think what I want is to be king of the world.\"\n\nShe stood quite still staring at him.\n\n\"I do not know how I can tell you of it. Amanda, do you remember those\nbodies--you saw those bodies--those mutilated men?\"\n\n\"I saw them,\" said Amanda.\n\n\"Well. Is it nothing to you that those things happen?\"\n\n\"They must happen.\"\n\n\"No. They happen because there are no kings but pitiful kings. They\nhappen because the kings love their Amandas and do not care.\"\n\n\"But what can YOU do, Cheetah?\"\n\n\"Very little. But I can give my life and all my strength. I can give all\nI can give.\"\n\n\"But how? How can you help it--help things like that massacre?\"\n\n\"I can do my utmost to find out what is wrong with my world and rule it\nand set it right.\"\n\n\"YOU! Alone.\"\n\n\"Other men do as much. Every one who does so helps others to do so. You\nsee--... In this world one may wake in the night and one may resolve to\nbe a king, and directly one has resolved one is a king. Does that sound\nfoolishness to you? Anyhow, it's fair that I should tell you, though\nyou count me a fool. This--this kingship--this dream of the night--is\nmy life. It is the very core of me. Much more than you are. More than\nanything else can be. I mean to be a king in this earth. KING. I'm not\nmad.... I see the world staggering from misery to misery and there is\nlittle wisdom, less rule, folly, prejudice, limitation, the good things\ncome by chance and the evil things recover and slay them, and it is my\nworld and I am responsible. Every man to whom this light has come\nis responsible. As soon as this light comes to you, as soon as your\nkingship is plain to you, there is no more rest, no peace, no delight,\nexcept in work, in service, in utmost effort. As far as I can do it I\nwill rule my world. I cannot abide in this smug city, I cannot\nendure its self-complacency, its routine, its gloss of success, its\nrottenness.... I shall do little, perhaps I shall do nothing, but what I\ncan understand and what I can do I will do. Think of that wild beautiful\ncountry we saw, and the mean misery, the filth and the warring cruelty\nof the life that lives there, tragedy, tragedy without dignity; and\nthink, too, of the limitless ugliness here, and of Russia slipping\nfrom disorder to massacre, and China, that sea of human beings,\nsliding steadily to disaster. Do you think these are only things in the\nnewspapers? To me at any rate they are not things in newspapers; they\nare pain and failure, they are torment, they are blood and dust and\nmisery. They haunt me day and night. Even if it is utterly absurd I will\nstill do my utmost. It IS absurd. I'm a madman and you and my mother\nare sensible people.... And I will go my way.... I don't care for the\nabsurdity. I don't care a rap.\"\n\nHe stopped abruptly.\n\n\"There you have it, Amanda. It's rant, perhaps. Sometimes I feel it's\nrant. And yet it's the breath of life to me.... There you are.... At\nlast I've been able to break silence and tell you....\"\n\nHe stopped with something like a sob and stood regarding the dusky\nmystery of her face. She stood quite still, she was just a beautiful\noutline in the twilight, her face was an indistinctness under the black\nshadow of her hair, with eyes that were two patches of darkness.\n\nHe looked at his watch, lifting it close to his face to see the time.\nHis voice changed. \"Well--if you provoke a man enough, you see he makes\nspeeches. Let it be a lesson to you, Amanda. Here we are talking instead\nof going to our dinners. The car has been waiting ten minutes.\"\n\nAmanda, so still, was the most disconcerting of all Amandas....\n\nA strange exaltation seized upon her very suddenly. In an instant she\nhad ceased to plot against him. A vast wave of emotion swept her forward\nto a resolution that astonished her.\n\n\"Cheetah!\" she said, and the very quality of her voice had changed,\n\"give me one thing. Stay until June with me.\"\n\n\"Why?\" he asked.\n\nHer answer came in a voice so low that it was almost a whisper.\n\n\"Because--now--no, I don't want to keep you any more--I am not trying to\nhold you any more.... I want....\"\n\nShe came forward to him and looked up closely at his face.\n\n\"Cheetah,\" she whispered almost inaudibly, \"Cheetah--I didn't\nunderstand. But now--. I want to bear your child.\"\n\nHe was astonished. \"Old Leopard!\" he said.\n\n\"No,\" she answered, putting her hands upon his shoulders and drawing\nvery close to him, \"Queen---if I can be--to your King.\"\n\n\"You want to bear me a child!\" he whispered, profoundly moved.\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nThe Hindu agitators at the cavernous dinner under the House of Commons\ncame to the conclusion that Benham was a dreamer. And over against\nAmanda at her dinner-party sat Sir Sidney Umber, one of those men who\nknow that their judgments are quoted.\n\n\"Who is the beautiful young woman who is seeing visions?\" he asked of\nhis neighbour in confidential undertones....\n\nHe tittered. \"I think, you know, she ought to seem just SLIGHTLY aware\nthat the man to her left is talking to her....\"\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nA few days later Benham went down to Cambridge, where Prothero was now a\nfellow of Trinity and Brissenden Trust Lecturer....\n\nAll through Benham's writing there was manifest a persuasion that in\nsome way Prothero was necessary to his mind. It was as if he looked to\nProthero to keep him real. He suspected even while he obeyed that upward\nflourish which was his own essential characteristic. He had a peculiar\nfeeling that somehow that upward bias would betray him; that from\nexaltation he might presently float off, into the higher, the better,\nand so to complete unreality. He fled from priggishness and the terror\nof such sublimity alike to Prothero. Moreover, in relation to so many\nthings Prothero in a peculiar distinctive manner SAW. He had less\nself-control than Benham, less integrity of purpose, less concentration,\nand things that were before his eyes were by the very virtue of these\ndefects invariably visible to him. Things were able to insist upon\nthemselves with him. Benham, on the other hand, when facts contradicted\nhis purpose too stoutly, had a way of becoming blind to them. He\nrepudiated inconvenient facts. He mastered and made his world; Prothero\naccepted and recorded his. Benham was a will towards the universe where\nProthero was a perception and Amanda a confusing responsive activity.\nAnd it was because of his realization of this profound difference\nbetween them that he was possessed by the idea of taking Prothero with\nhim about the world, as a detachable kind of vision--rather like that\neye the Graiae used to hand one another....\n\nAfter the busy sunlit streets of Maytime Cambridge, Prothero's rooms in\nTrinity, their windows full of Gothic perspectives and light-soaked blue\nsky, seemed cool and quiet. A flavour of scholarship pervaded them--a\nlittle blended with the flavour of innumerable breakfasts nearly but not\ncompletely forgotten. Prothero's door had been locked against the world,\nand he had appeared after a slight delay looking a little puffy and only\napprehending who his visitor was after a resentful stare for the better\npart of a second. He might have been asleep, he might have been doing\nanything but the examination papers he appeared to be doing. The two men\nexchanged personal details; they had not met since some months before\nBenham' s marriage, and the visitor's eye went meanwhile from his host\nto the room and back to his host's face as though they were all aspects\nof the thing he was after, the Prothero humour, the earthly touch, the\ndistinctive Prothero flavour. Then his eye was caught by a large red,\nincongruous, meretricious-looking volume upon the couch that had an\nair of having been flung aside, VENUS IN GEM AND MARBLE, its cover\nproclaimed....\n\nHis host followed that glance and blushed. \"They send me all sorts of\ninappropriate stuff to review,\" he remarked.\n\nAnd then he was denouncing celibacy.\n\nThe transition wasn't very clear to Benham. His mind had been\npreoccupied by the problem of how to open his own large project.\nMeanwhile Prothero got, as it were, the conversational bit between his\nteeth and bolted. He began to say the most shocking things right away,\nso that Benham's attention was caught in spite of himself.\n\n\"Inflammatory classics.\"\n\n\"What's that?\"\n\n\"Celibacy, my dear Benham, is maddening me,\" said Prothero. \"I can't\nstand it any longer.\"\n\nIt seemed to Benham that somewhere, very far away, in another world,\nsuch a statement might have been credible. Even in his own life,--it was\nnow indeed a remote, forgotten stage--there had been something distantly\nakin....\n\n\"You're going to marry?\"\n\n\"I must.\"\n\n\"Who's the lady, Billy?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Venus.\"\n\nHis little red-brown eye met his friend's defiantly. \"So far as I know,\nit is Venus Anadyomene.\" A flash of laughter passed across his face\nand left it still angrier, still more indecorously defiant. \"I like her\nbest, anyhow. I do, indeed. But, Lord! I feel that almost any of them--\"\n\n\"Tut, tut!\" said Benham.\n\nProthero flushed deeply but stuck to his discourse.\n\n\"Wasn't it always your principle, Benham, to look facts in the face? I\nam not pronouncing an immoral principle. Your manner suggests I am. I\nam telling you exactly how I feel. That is how I feel. I want--Venus.\nI don't want her to talk to or anything of that sort.... I have been\nstudying that book, yes, that large, vulgar, red book, all the morning,\ninstead of doing any work. Would you like to see it?... NO!...\n\n\"This spring, Benham, I tell you, is driving me mad. It is a peculiarly\nerotic spring. I cannot sleep, I cannot fix my mind, I cannot attend\nto ordinary conversation. These feelings, I understand, are by no means\npeculiar to myself.... No, don't interrupt me, Benham; let me talk now\nthat the spirit of speech is upon me. When you came in you said, 'How\nare you?' I am telling you how I am. You brought it on yourself. Well--I\nam--inflamed. I have no strong moral or religious convictions to assist\nme either to endure or deny this--this urgency. And so why should I deny\nit? It's one of our chief problems here. The majority of my fellow\ndons who look at me with secretive faces in hall and court and\ncombination-room are in just the same case as myself. The fever in\noneself detects the fever in others. I know their hidden thoughts. Their\nfishy eyes defy me to challenge their hidden thoughts. Each covers his\nmiserable secret under the cloak of a wholesome manly indifference. A\ntattered cloak.... Each tries to hide his abandonment to this horrible\nvice of continence--\"\n\n\"Billy, what's the matter with you?\"\n\nProthero grimaced impatience. \"Shall I NEVER teach you not to be a\nhumbug, Benham?\" he screamed, and in screaming became calmer. \"Nature\ntaunts me, maddens me. My life is becoming a hell of shame. 'Get out\nfrom all these books,' says Nature, 'and serve the Flesh.' The Flesh,\nBenham. Yes--I insist--the Flesh. Do I look like a pure spirit? Is any\nman a pure spirit? And here am I at Cambridge like a lark in a cage,\nwith too much port and no Aspasia. Not that I should have liked\nAspasia.\"\n\n\"Mutual, perhaps, Billy.\"\n\n\"Oh! you can sneer!\"\n\n\"Well, clearly--Saint Paul is my authority--it's marriage, Billy.\"\n\nProthero had walked to the window. He turned round.\n\n\"I CAN'T marry,\" he said. \"The trouble has gone too far. I've lost my\nnerve in the presence of women. I don't like them any more. They come\nat one--done up in a lot of ridiculous clothes, and chattering about\nall sorts of things that don't matter....\" He surveyed his friend's\nthoughtful attitude. \"I'm getting to hate women, Benham. I'm beginning\nnow to understand the bitterness of spinsters against men. I'm beginning\nto grasp the unkindliness of priests. The perpetual denial. To you,\nhappily married, a woman is just a human being. You can talk to her,\nlike her, you can even admire her calmly; you've got, you see, no grudge\nagainst her....\"\n\nHe sat down abruptly.\n\nBenham, upon the hearthrug before the empty fireplace, considered him.\n\n\"Billy! this is delusion,\" he said. \"What's come over you?\"\n\n\"I'm telling you,\" said Prothero.\n\n\"No,\" said Benham.\n\nProthero awaited some further utterance.\n\n\"I'm looking for the cause of it. It's feeding, Billy. It's port and\nstimulants where there is no scope for action. It's idleness. I begin to\nsee now how much fatter you are, how much coarser.\"\n\n\"Idleness! Look at this pile of examination answers. Look at that filing\nsystem like an arsenal of wisdom. Useless wisdom, I admit, but anyhow\nnot idleness.\"\n\n\"There's still bodily idleness. No. That's your trouble. You're stuffy.\nYou've enlarged your liver. You sit in this room of a warm morning after\nan extravagant breakfast--. And peep and covet.\"\n\n\"Just eggs and bacon!\"\n\n\"Think of it! Coffee and toast it ought to be. Come out of it, Billy,\nand get aired.\"\n\n\"How can one?\"\n\n\"Easily. Come out of it now. Come for a walk, you Pig!\"\n\n\"It's an infernally warm morning.\n\n\"Walk with me to Grantchester.\"\n\n\"We might go by boat. You could row.\"\n\n\"WALK.\"\n\n\"I ought to do these papers.\"\n\n\"You weren't doing them.\"\n\n\"No....\"\n\n\"Walk with me to Grantchester. All this affliction of yours\nis--horrid--and just nothing at all. Come out of it! I want you to come\nwith me to Russia and about the world. I'm going to leave my wife--\"\n\n\"Leave your wife!\"\n\n\"Why not? And I came here hoping to find you clear-headed, and instead\nyou are in this disgusting state. I've never met anything in my life so\nhot and red and shiny and shameless. Come out of it, man! How can one\ntalk to you?\"\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\"You pull things down to your own level,\" said Benham as they went\nthrough the heat to Grantchester.\n\n\"I pull them down to truth,\" panted Prothero.\n\n\"Truth! As though being full of gross appetites was truth, and\ndiscipline and training some sort of falsity!\"\n\n\"Artificiality. And begetting pride, Benham, begetting a prig's pride.\"\n\nFor a time there was more than the heat of the day between them....\n\nThe things that Benham had come down to discuss were thrust into the\nbackground by the impassioned materialism of Prothero.\n\n\"I'm not talking of Love,\" he said, remaining persistently outrageous.\n\"I'm talking of physical needs. That first. What is the good of\narranging systems of morality and sentiment before you know what is\nphysically possible....\n\n\"But how can one disentangle physical and moral necessities?\"\n\n\"Then why don't we up and find out?\" said Billy.\n\nHe had no patience with the secrecy, the ignorance, the emotion that\nsurrounded these questions. We didn't worship our ancestors when it came\nto building bridges or working metals or curing disease or studying our\nindigestion, and why should we become breathless or wordless with\nawe and terror when it came to this fundamental affair? Why here in\nparticular should we give way to Holy Fear and stifled submission to\ntraditional suppressions and the wisdom of the ages? \"What is the wisdom\nof the ages?\" said Prothero. \"Think of the corners where that wisdom was\nborn.... Flea-bitten sages in stone-age hovels.... Wandering wise\nman with a rolling eye, a fakir under a tree, a Jewish sheik, an Arab\nepileptic....\"\n\n\"Would you sweep away the experience of mankind?\" protested Benham.\n\nThe experience of mankind in these matters had always been bitter\nexperience. Most of it was better forgotten. It didn't convince. It had\nnever worked things out. In this matter just as in every other matter\nthat really signified things had still to be worked out. Nothing had\nbeen worked out hitherto. The wisdom of the ages was a Cant. People had\nbeen too busy quarrelling, fighting and running away. There wasn't\nany digested experience of the ages at all. Only the mis-remembered\nhankey-pankey of the Dead Old Man.\n\n\"Is this love-making a physical necessity for most men and women or\nisn't it?\" Prothero demanded. \"There's a simple question enough, and is\nthere anything whatever in your confounded wisdom of the ages to tell\nme yes or no? Can an ordinary celibate be as healthy and vigorous as a\nmated man? Is a spinster of thirty-eight a healthy human being? Can she\nbe? I don't believe so. Then why in thunder do we let her be? Here am I\nat a centre of learning and wisdom and I don't believe so; and there is\nnothing in all our colleges, libraries and roomsfull of wiseacres here,\nto settle that plain question for me, plainly and finally. My life is a\ngrubby torment of cravings because it isn't settled. If sexual activity\nIS a part of the balance of life, if it IS a necessity, well let's set\nabout making it accessible and harmless and have done with it. Swedish\nexercises. That sort of thing. If it isn't, if it can be reduced and\ndone without, then let us set about teaching people HOW to control\nthemselves and reduce and get rid of this vehement passion. But all this\nmuffled mystery, this pompous sneak's way we take with it!\"\n\n\"But, Billy! How can one settle these things? It's a matter of\nidiosyncrasy. What is true for one man isn't true for another. There's\ninfinite difference of temperaments!\"\n\n\"Then why haven't we a classification of temperaments and a moral code\nfor each sort? Why am I ruled by the way of life that is convenient for\nRigdon the vegetarian and fits Bowler the saint like a glove? It isn't\nconvenient for me. It fits me like a hair-shirt. Of course there\nare temperaments, but why can't we formulate them and exercise the\nelementary charity of recognizing that one man's health in these matters\nis another man's death? Some want love and gratification and some don't.\nThere are people who want children and people who don't want to be\nbothered by children but who are full of vivid desires. There are\npeople whose only happiness is chastity, and women who would rather\nbe courtesans than mothers. Some of us would concentrate upon a\nsingle passion or a single idea; others overflow with a\nmiscellaneous--tenderness. Yes,--and you smile! Why spit upon and insult\na miscellaneous tenderness, Benham? Why grin at it? Why try every one\nby the standards that suit oneself? We're savages, Benham, shamefaced\nsavages, still. Shamefaced and persecuting.\n\n\"I was angry about sex by seventeen,\" he went on. \"Every year I live I\ngrow angrier.\"\n\nHis voice rose to a squeal of indignation as he talked.\n\n\"Think,\" he said, \"of the amount of thinking and feeling about sex\nthat is going on in Cambridge this morning. The hundreds out of these\nthousands full of it. A vast tank of cerebration. And we put none of it\ntogether; we work nothing out from that but poor little couplings and\ncasual stories, patchings up of situations, misbehaviours, blunders,\ndisease, trouble, escapes; and the next generation will start, and the\nnext generation after that will start with nothing but your wisdom of\nthe ages, which isn't wisdom at all, which is just awe and funk, taboos\nand mystery and the secretive cunning of the savage....\n\n\"What I really want to do is my work,\" said Prothero, going off quite\nunexpectedly again. \"That is why all this business, this incessant\ncraving and the shame of it and all makes me so infernally angry....\"\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\"There I'm with you,\" cried Benham, struggling out of the thick torrent\nof Prothero's prepossessions. \"What we want to do is our work.\"\n\nHe clung to his idea. He raised his voice to prevent Prothero getting\nthe word again.\n\n\"It's this, that you call Work, that I call--what do I call it?--living\nthe aristocratic life, which takes all the coarse simplicity out of\nthis business. If it was only submission.... YOU think it is only\nsubmission--giving way.... It isn't only submission. We'd manage sex all\nright, we'd be the happy swine our senses would make us, if we didn't\nknow all the time that there was something else to live for,\nsomething far more important. And different. Absolutely different\nand contradictory. So different that it cuts right across all these\nconsiderations. It won't fit in.... I don't know what this other thing\nis; it's what I want to talk about with you. But I know that it IS, in\nall my bones.... YOU know.... It demands control, it demands continence,\nit insists upon disregard.\"\n\nBut the ideas of continence and disregard were unpleasant ideas to\nProthero that day.\n\n\"Mankind,\" said Benham, \"is overcharged with this sex. It suffocates\nus. It gives life only to consume it. We struggle out of the urgent\nnecessities of a mere animal existence. We are not so much living as\nbeing married and given in marriage. All life is swamped in the love\nstory....\"\n\n\"Man is only overcharged because he is unsatisfied,\" said Prothero,\nsticking stoutly to his own view.\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nIt was only as they sat at a little table in the orchard at Grantchester\nafter their lunch that Benham could make head against Prothero and\nrecover that largeness of outlook which had so easily touched the\nimagination of Amanda. And then he did not so much dispose of Prothero's\ntroubles as soar over them. It is the last triumph of the human\nunderstanding to sympathize with desires we do not share, and to Benham\nwho now believed himself to be loved beyond the chances of life, who\nwas satisfied and tranquil and austerely content, it was impossible\nthat Prothero's demands should seem anything more than the grotesque and\nsqualid squealings of the beast that has to be overridden and rejected\naltogether. It is a freakish fact of our composition that these most\nintense feelings in life are just those that are most rapidly and\ncompletely forgotten; hate one may recall for years, but the magic\nof love and the flame of desire serve their purpose in our lives and\nvanish, leaving no trace, like the snows of Venice. Benham was still not\na year and a half from the meretricious delights of Mrs. Skelmersdale,\nand he looked at Prothero as a marble angel might look at a swine in its\nsty....\n\nWhat he had now in mind was an expedition to Russia. When at last he\ncould sufficiently release Prothero's attention, he unfolded the project\nthat had been developing steadily in him since his honeymoon experience.\n\nHe had discovered a new reason for travelling. The last country we can\nsee clearly, he had discovered, is our own country. It is as hard to see\none's own country as it is to see the back of one's head. It is too\nmuch behind us, too much ourselves. But Russia is like England with\neverything larger, more vivid, cruder; one felt that directly one walked\nabout St. Petersburg. St. Petersburg upon its Neva was like a savage\nuntamed London on a larger Thames; they were seagull-haunted tidal\ncities, like no other capitals in Europe. The shipping and buildings\nmingled in their effects. Like London it looked over the heads of\nits own people to a limitless polyglot empire. And Russia was an\naristocratic land, with a middle-class that had no pride in itself as a\nclass; it had a British toughness and incompetence, a British disregard\nof logic and meticulous care. Russia, like England, was outside Catholic\nChristendom, it had a state church and the opposition to that church was\nnot secularism but dissent. One could draw a score of such contrasted\nparallels. And now it was in a state of intolerable stress, that laid\nbare the elemental facts of a great social organization. It was having\nits South African war, its war at the other end of the earth, with a\ncertain defeat instead of a dubious victory....\n\n\"There is far more freedom for the personal life in Russia than in\nEngland,\" said Prothero, a little irrelevantly.\n\nBenham went on with his discourse about Russia....\n\n\"At the college of Troitzka,\" said Prothero, \"which I understand is a\nkind of monster Trinity unencumbered by a University, Binns tells me\nthat although there is a profession of celibacy within the walls, the\narrangements of the town and more particularly of the various hotels are\nconceived in a spirit of extreme liberality.\"\n\nBenham hardly attended at all to these interruptions.\n\nHe went on to point out the elemental quality of the Russian situation.\nHe led up to the assertion that to go to Russia, to see Russia, to try\nto grasp the broad outline of the Russian process, was the manifest duty\nof every responsible intelligence that was free to do as much. And so he\nwas going, and if Prothero cared to come too--\n\n\"Yes,\" said Prothero, \"I should like to go to Russia.\"\n\n\n\n13\n\n\nBut throughout all their travel together that summer Benham was never\nable to lift Prothero away from his obsession. It was the substance of\ntheir talk as the Holland boat stood out past waiting destroyers and\nwinking beacons and the lights of Harwich, into the smoothly undulating\ndarkness of the North Sea; it rose upon them again as they sat over\nthe cakes and cheese of a Dutch breakfast in the express for Berlin.\nProthero filled the Sieges Allee with his complaints against nature\nand society, and distracted Benham in his contemplation of Polish\nagriculture from the windows of the train with turgid sexual liberalism.\nSo that Benham, during this period until Prothero left him and until\nthe tragic enormous spectacle of Russia in revolution took complete\npossession of him, was as it were thinking upon two floors. Upon the one\nhe was thinking of the vast problems of a society of a hundred million\npeople staggering on the verge of anarchy, and upon the other he was\nperplexed by the feverish inattention of Prothero to the tremendous\nthings that were going on all about them. It was only presently when the\nserenity of his own private life began to be ruffled by disillusionment,\nthat he began to realize the intimate connexion of these two systems of\nthought. Yet Prothero put it to him plainly enough.\n\n\"Inattentive,\" said Prothero, \"of course I am inattentive. What is\nreally the matter with all this--this social mess people are in here, is\nthat nearly everybody is inattentive. These Big Things of yours, nobody\nis thinking of them really. Everybody is thinking about the Near Things\nthat concern himself.\"\n\n\"The bombs they threw yesterday? The Cossacks and the whips?\"\n\n\"Nudges. Gestures of inattention. If everybody was thinking of the Res\nPublica would there be any need for bombs?\"\n\nHe pursued his advantage. \"It's all nonsense to suppose people think of\npolitics because they are in 'em. As well suppose that the passengers on\na liner understand the engines, or soldiers a war. Before men can\nthink of to-morrow, they must think of to-day. Before they can think\nof others, they must be sure about themselves. First of all, food; the\nprivate, the personal economic worry. Am I safe for food? Then sex, and\nuntil one is tranquil and not ashamed, not irritated and dissatisfied,\nhow can one care for other people, or for next year or the Order of the\nWorld? How can one, Benham?\"\n\nHe seized the illustration at hand. \"Here we are in Warsaw--not a month\nafter bomb-throwing and Cossack charging. Windows have still to be\nmended, smashed doors restored. There's blood-stains still on some\nof the houses. There are hundreds of people in the Citadel and in the\nOchrana prison. This morning there were executions. Is it anything more\nthan an eddy in the real life of the place? Watch the customers in the\nshops, the crowd in the streets, the men in the cafes who stare at the\npassing women. They are all swallowed up again in their own business.\nThey just looked up as the Cossacks galloped past; they just shifted a\nbit when the bullets spat....\"\n\nAnd when the streets of Moscow were agog with the grotesque amazing\nadventure of the Potemkin mutineers, Prothero was in the full tide of\nthe private romance that severed him from Benham and sent him back to\nCambridge--changed.\n\nBefore they reached Moscow Benham was already becoming accustomed to\ndisregard Prothero. He was looking over him at the vast heaving trouble\nof Russia, which now was like a sea that tumbles under the hurrying\ndarknesses of an approaching storm. In those days it looked as though it\nmust be an overwhelming storm. He was drinking in the wide and massive\nRussian effects, the drifting crowds in the entangling streets, the\nhouses with their strange lettering in black and gold, the innumerable\nbarbaric churches, the wildly driven droshkys, the sombre red fortress\nof the Kremlin, with its bulbous churches clustering up into the sky,\nthe crosses, the innumerable gold crosses, the mad church of St. Basil,\ncarrying the Russian note beyond the pitch of permissible caricature,\nand in this setting the obscure drama of clustering, staring,\nsash-wearing peasants, long-haired students, sane-eyed women, a thousand\nvarieties of uniform, a running and galloping to and fro of messengers,\na flutter of little papers, whispers, shouts, shots, a drama elusive and\nportentous, a gathering of forces, an accumulation of tension going on\nto a perpetual clash and clamour of bells. Benham had brought letters of\nintroduction to a variety of people, some had vanished, it seemed. They\nwere \"away,\" the porters said, and they continued to be \"away,\"--it was\nthe formula, he learnt, for arrest; others were evasive, a few showed\nthemselves extraordinarily anxious to inform him about things, to\nexplain themselves and things about them exhaustively. One young student\ntook him to various meetings and showed him in great detail the scene of\nthe recent murder of the Grand Duke Sergius. The buildings opposite the\nold French cannons were still under repair. \"The assassin stood just\nhere. The bomb fell there, look! right down there towards the gate; that\nwas where they found his arm. He was torn to fragments. He was scraped\nup. He was mixed with the horses....\"\n\nEvery one who talked spoke of the outbreak of revolution as a matter of\ndays or at the utmost weeks. And whatever question Benham chose to\nask these talkers were prepared to answer. Except one. \"And after the\nrevolution,\" he asked, \"what then?...\" Then they waved their hands, and\nfailed to convey meanings by reassuring gestures.\n\nHe was absorbed in his effort to understand this universal ominous drift\ntowards a conflict. He was trying to piece together a process, if it\nwas one and the same process, which involved riots in Lodz, fighting at\nLibau, wild disorder at Odessa, remote colossal battlings in Manchuria,\nthe obscure movements of a disastrous fleet lost somewhere now in the\nIndian seas, steaming clumsily to its fate, he was trying to rationalize\nit all in his mind, to comprehend its direction. He was struggling\nstrenuously with the obscurities of the language in which these things\nwere being discussed about him, a most difficult language demanding new\nsets of visual images because of its strange alphabet. Is it any wonder\nthat for a time he failed to observe that Prothero was involved in some\nentirely disconnected affair.\n\nThey were staying at the big Cosmopolis bazaar in the Theatre Square.\nThither, through the doors that are opened by distraught-looking men\nwith peacocks' feathers round their caps, came Benham's friends and\nguides to take him out and show him this and that. At first Prothero\nalways accompanied Benham on these expeditions; then he began to make\nexcuses. He would stay behind in the hotel. Then when Benham returned\nProthero would have disappeared. When the porter was questioned about\nProthero his nescience was profound.\n\nOne night no Prothero was discoverable at any hour, and Benham, who\nwanted to discuss a project for going on to Kieff and Odessa, was\nalarmed.\n\n\"Moscow is a late place,\" said Benham's student friend. \"You need not\nbe anxious until after four or five in the morning. It will be quite\ntime--QUITE time to be anxious to-morrow. He may be--close at hand.\"\n\nWhen Benham hunted up Prothero in his room next morning he found him\nsleepy and irritable.\n\n\"I don't trouble if YOU are late,\" said Prothero, sitting up in his bed\nwith a red resentful face and crumpled hair. \"I wasn't born yesterday.\"\n\n\"I wanted to talk about leaving Moscow.\"\n\n\"I don't want to leave Moscow.\"\n\n\"But Odessa--Odessa is the centre of interest just now.\"\n\n\"I want to stay in Moscow.\"\n\nBenham looked baffled.\n\nProthero stuck up his knees and rested his night-shirted arms upon them.\n\"I don't want to leave Moscow,\" he said, \"and I'm not going to do so.\"\n\n\"But haven't we done--\"\n\nProthero interrupted. \"You may. But I haven't. We're not after the\nsame things. Things that interest you, Benham, don't interest me. I've\nfound--different things.\"\n\nHis expression was extraordinarily defiant.\n\n\"I want,\" he went on, \"to put our affairs on a different footing. Now\nyou've opened the matter we may as well go into it. You were good enough\nto bring me here.... There was a sort of understanding we were working\ntogether.... We aren't.... The long and short of it is, Benham, I want\nto pay you for my journey here and go on my own--independently.\"\n\nHis eye and voice achieved a fierceness that Benham found nearly\nincredible in him.\n\nSomething that had got itself overlooked in the press of other matters\njerked back into Benham's memory. It popped back so suddenly that for an\ninstant he wanted to laugh. He turned towards the window, picked his\nway among Prothero's carelessly dropped garments, and stood for a moment\nstaring into the square, with its drifting, assembling and dispersing\nfleet of trains and its long line of blue-coated IZVOSHTCHIKS. Then he\nturned.\n\n\"Billy,\" he said, \"didn't I see you the other evening driving towards\nthe Hermitage?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Prothero, and added, \"that's it.\"\n\n\"You were with a lady.\"\n\n\"And she IS a lady,\" said Prothero, so deeply moved that his face\ntwitched as though he was going to weep.\n\n\"She's a Russian?\"\n\n\"She had an English mother. Oh, you needn't stand there and look so\ndamned ironical! She's--she's a woman. She's a thing of kindness....\"\n\nHe was too full to go on.\n\n\"Billy, old boy,\" said Benham, distressed, \"I don't want to be\nironical--\"\n\nProthero had got his voice again.\n\n\"You'd better know,\" he said, \"you'd better know. She's one of those\nwomen who live in this hotel.\"\n\n\"Live in this hotel!\"\n\n\"On the fourth floor. Didn't you know? It's the way in most of these big\nRussian hotels. They come down and sit about after lunch and dinner. A\nwoman with a yellow ticket. Oh! I don't care. I don't care a rap. She's\nbeen kind to me; she's--she's dear to me. How are you to understand? I\nshall stop in Moscow. I shall take her to England. I can't live without\nher, Benham. And then-- And then you come worrying me to come to your\ndamned Odessa!\"\n\nAnd suddenly this extraordinary young man put his hands to his face\nas though he feared to lose it and would hold it on, and after an\napoplectic moment burst noisily into tears. They ran between his\nfingers. \"Get out of my room,\" he shouted, suffocatingly. \"What business\nhave you to come prying on me?\"\n\nBenham sat down on a chair in the middle of the room and stared\nround-eyed at his friend. His hands were in his pockets. For a time he\nsaid nothing.\n\n\"Billy,\" he began at last, and stopped again. \"Billy, in this country\nsomehow one wants to talk like a Russian. Billy, my dear--I'm not your\nfather, I'm not your judge. I'm--unreasonably fond of you. It's not my\nbusiness to settle what is right or wrong for you. If you want to stay\nin Moscow, stay in Moscow. Stay here, and stay as my guest....\"\n\nHe stopped and remained staring at his friend for a little space.\n\n\"I didn't know,\" said Prothero brokenly; \"I didn't know it was possible\nto get so fond of a person....\"\n\nBenham stood up. He had never found Prothero so attractive and so\nabominable in his life before.\n\n\"I shall go to Odessa alone, Billy. I'll make things all right here\nbefore I go....\"\n\nHe closed the door behind him and went in a state of profound thought to\nhis own room....\n\nPresently Prothero came to him with a vague inopportune desire to\nexplain what so evidently did not need explaining. He walked about the\nroom trying ways of putting it, while Benham packed.\n\nIn an unaccountable way Prothero's bristling little mind seemed to have\nshrunken to something sleek and small.\n\n\"I wish,\" he said, \"you could stay for a later train and have lunch and\nmeet her. She's not the ordinary thing. She's--different.\"\n\nBenham plumbed depths of wisdom. \"Billy,\" he said, \"no woman IS the\nordinary thing. They are all--different....\"\n\n\n\n14\n\n\nFor a time this affair of Prothero's seemed to be a matter as\ndisconnected from the Research Magnificent as one could imagine any\nmatter to be. While Benham went from Moscow and returned, and travelled\nhither and thither, and involved himself more and more in the endless\ntangled threads of the revolutionary movement in Russia, Prothero\nwas lost to all those large issues in the development of his personal\nsituation. He contributed nothing to Benham's thought except attempts at\ndiscouragement. He reiterated his declaration that all the vast\nstress and change of Russian national life was going on because it was\nuniversally disregarded. \"I tell you, as I told you before, that nobody\nis attending. You think because all Moscow, all Russia, is in the\npicture, that everybody is concerned. Nobody is concerned. Nobody cares\nwhat is happening. Even the men who write in newspapers and talk at\nmeetings about it don't care. They are thinking of their dinners, of\ntheir clothes, of their money, of their wives. They hurry home....\"\n\nThat was his excuse.\n\nManifestly it was an excuse.\n\nHis situation developed into remarkable complications of jealousy and\ndivided counsels that Benham found altogether incomprehensible. To\nBenham in those days everything was very simple in this business of\nlove. The aristocrat had to love ideally; that was all. He had to love\nAmanda. He and Amanda were now very deeply in love again, more in\nlove, he felt, than they had ever been before. They were now writing\nlove-letters to each other and enjoying a separation that was almost\nvoluptuous. She found in the epistolatory treatment of her surrender to\nhim and to the natural fate of women, a delightful exercise for her very\nconsiderable powers of expression. Life pointed now wonderfully to the\ngreat time ahead when there would be a Cheetah cub in the world, and\nmeanwhile the Cheetah loped about the wild world upon a mighty quest. In\nsuch terms she put it. Such foolishness written in her invincibly square\nand youthful hand went daily from London to Russia, and stacked up\nagainst his return in the porter's office at the Cosmopolis Bazaar or\npursued him down through the jarring disorders of south-west Russia, or\nwaited for him at ill-chosen post-offices that deflected his journeyings\nwastefully or in several instances went altogether astray. Perhaps they\nsupplied self-educating young strikers in the postal service with useful\nexercises in the deciphering of manuscript English. He wrote back five\nhundred different ways of saying that he loved her extravagantly....\n\nIt seemed to Benham in those days that he had found the remedy and\nsolution of all those sexual perplexities that distressed the world;\nHeroic Love to its highest note--and then you go about your business. It\nseemed impossible not to be happy and lift one's chin high and diffuse\na bracing kindliness among the unfortunate multitudes who stewed in\naffliction and hate because they had failed as yet to find this simple,\nculminating elucidation. And Prothero--Prothero, too, was now achieving\nthe same grand elementariness, out of his lusts and protests and general\nphysical squalor he had flowered into love. For a time it is true it\nmade rather an ineffective companion of him, but this was the mere\ngoose-stepping for the triumphal march; this way ultimately lay\nexaltation. Benham had had as yet but a passing glimpse of this\nAnglo-Russian, who was a lady and altogether unlike her fellows; he had\nseen her for a doubtful second or so as she and Prothero drove past him,\nand his impression was of a rather little creature, white-faced with\ndusky hair under a red cap, paler and smaller but with something in her,\na quiet alertness, that gave her a touch of kinship with Amanda. And\nif she liked old Prothero-- And, indeed, she must like old Prothero or\ncould she possibly have made him so deeply in love with her?\n\nThey must stick to each other, and then, presently, Prothero's soul\nwould wake up and face the world again. What did it matter what she had\nbeen?\n\nThrough stray shots and red conflict, long tediums of strained anxiety\nand the physical dangers of a barbaric country staggering towards\nrevolution, Benham went with his own love like a lamp within him\nand this affair of Prothero's reflecting its light, and he was quite\nprepared for the most sympathetic and liberal behaviour when he came\nback to Moscow to make the lady's acquaintance. He intended to help\nProthero to marry and take her back to Cambridge, and to assist by every\npossible means in destroying and forgetting the official yellow ticket\nthat defined her status in Moscow. But he reckoned without either\nProthero or the young lady in this expectation.\n\nIt only got to him slowly through his political preoccupations\nthat there were obscure obstacles to this manifest course. Prothero\nhesitated; the lady expressed doubts.\n\nOn closer acquaintance her resemblance to Amanda diminished. It was\nchiefly a similarity of complexion. She had a more delicate face than\nAmanda, and its youthful brightness was deadened; she had none of\nAmanda's glow, and she spoke her mother's language with a pretty halting\nlimp that was very different from Amanda's clear decisions.\n\nShe put her case compactly.\n\n\"I would not DO in Cambridge,\" she said with an infinitesimal glance at\nProthero.\n\n\"Mr. Benham,\" she said, and her manner had the gravity of a woman\nof affairs, \"now do you see me in Cambridge? Now do you see me? Kept\noutside the walls? In a little DATCHA? With no occupation? Just to amuse\nhim.\"\n\nAnd on another occasion when Prothero was not with her she achieved\nstill completer lucidity.\n\n\"I would come if I thought he wanted me to come,\" she said. \"But you see\nif I came he would not want me to come. Because then he would have me\nand so he wouldn't want me. He would just have the trouble. And I am not\nsure if I should be happy in Cambridge. I am not sure I should be happy\nenough to make him happy. It is a very learned and intelligent and\ncharming society, of course; but here, THINGS HAPPEN. At Cambridge\nnothing happens--there is only education. There is no revolution in\nCambridge; there are not even sinful people to be sorry for.... And\nhe says himself that Cambridge people are particular. He says they are\nliberal but very, very particular, and perhaps I could not always act my\npart well. Sometimes I am not always well behaved. When there is music I\nbehave badly sometimes, or when I am bored. He says the Cambridge people\nare so liberal that they do not mind what you are, but he says they are\nso particular that they mind dreadfully how you are what you are.... So\nthat it comes to exactly the same thing....\"\n\n\"Anna Alexievna,\" said Benham suddenly, \"are you in love with Prothero?\"\n\nHer manner became conscientiously scientific.\n\n\"He is very kind and very generous--too generous. He keeps sending for\nmore money--hundreds of roubles, I try to prevent him.\"\n\n\"Were you EVER in love?\"\n\n\"Of course. But it's all gone long ago. It was like being hungry. Only\nvery fine hungry. Exquisite hungry.... And then being disgusted....\"\n\n\"He is in love with you.\"\n\n\"What is love?\" said Anna. \"He is grateful. He is by nature grateful.\"\nShe smiled a smile, like the smile of a pale Madonna who looks down on\nher bambino.\n\n\"And you love nothing?\"\n\n\"I love Russia--and being alone, being completely alone. When I am dead\nperhaps I shall be alone. Not even my own body will touch me then.\"\n\nThen she added, \"But I shall be sorry when he goes.\"\n\nAfterwards Benham talked to Prothero alone. \"Your Anna,\" he said, \"is\nrather wonderful. At first, I tell you now frankly I did not like her\nvery much, I thought she looked 'used,' she drank vodka at lunch, she\nwas gay, uneasily; she seemed a sham thing. All that was prejudice. She\nthinks; she's generous, she's fine.\"\n\n\"She's tragic,\" said Prothero as though it was the same thing.\n\nHe spoke as though he noted an objection. His next remark confirmed this\nimpression. \"That's why I can't take her back to Cambridge,\" he said.\n\n\"You see, Benham,\" he went on, \"she's human. She's not really feminine.\nI mean, she's--unsexed. She isn't fitted to be a wife or a mother any\nmore. We've talked about the possible life in England, very plainly.\nI've explained what a household in Cambridge would mean.... It doesn't\nattract her.... In a way she's been let out from womanhood, forced out\nof womanhood, and I see now that when women are let out from womanhood\nthere's no putting them back. I could give a lecture on Anna. I see\nnow that if women are going to be wives and mothers and homekeepers and\nladies, they must be got ready for it from the beginning, sheltered,\nnever really let out into the wild chances of life. She has been.\nBitterly. She's REALLY emancipated. And it's let her out into a sort of\nnothingness. She's no longer a woman, and she isn't a man. She ought\nto be able to go on her own--like a man. But I can't take her back to\nCambridge. Even for her sake.\"\n\nHis perplexed eyes regarded Benham.\n\n\"You won't be happy in Cambridge--alone,\" said Benham.\n\n\"Oh, damnably not! But what can I do? I had at first some idea of coming\nto Moscow for good--teaching.\"\n\nHe paused. \"Impossible. I'm worth nothing here. I couldn't have kept\nher.\"\n\n\"Then what are you going to do, Billy?\"\n\n\"I don't KNOW what I'm going to do, I tell you. I live for the moment.\nTo-morrow we are going out into the country.\"\n\n\"I don't understand,\" said Benham with a gesture of resignation. \"It\nseems to me that if a man and woman love each other--well, they insist\nupon each other. What is to happen to her if you leave her in Moscow?\"\n\n\"Damnation! Is there any need to ask that?\"\n\n\"Take her to Cambridge, man. And if Cambridge objects, teach Cambridge\nbetter manners.\"\n\nProthero's face was suddenly transfigured with rage.\n\n\"I tell you she won't come!\" he said.\n\n\"Billy!\" said Benham, \"you should make her!\"\n\n\"I can't.\"\n\n\"If a man loves a woman he can make her do anything--\"\n\n\"But I don't love her like that,\" said Prothero, shrill with anger. \"I\ntell you I don't love her like that.\"\n\nThen he lunged into further deeps. \"It's the other men,\" he said, \"it's\nthe things that have been. Don't you understand? Can't you understand?\nThe memories--she must have memories--they come between us. It's\nsomething deeper than reason. It's in one's spine and under one's nails.\nOne could do anything, I perceive, for one's very own woman....\"\n\n\"MAKE her your very own woman, said the exponent of heroic love.\n\n\"I shirk deeds, Benham, but you shirk facts. How could any man make her\nhis very own woman now? You--you don't seem to understand--ANYTHING.\nShe's nobody's woman--for ever. That--that might-have-been has gone for\never.... It's nerves--a passion of the nerves. There's a cruelty in life\nand-- She's KIND to me. She's so kind to me....\"\n\nAnd then again Prothero was weeping like a vexed child.\n\n\n\n15\n\n\nThe end of Prothero's first love affair came to Benham in broken\nfragments in letters. When he looked for Anna Alexievna in December--he\nnever learnt her surname--he found she had left the Cosmopolis Bazaar\nsoon after Prothero's departure and he could not find whither she had\ngone. He never found her again. Moscow and Russia had swallowed her up.\n\nOf course she and Prothero parted; that was a foregone conclusion. But\nProthero's manner of parting succeeded in being at every phase a shock\nto Benham's ideas. It was clear he went off almost callously; it would\nseem there was very little crying. Towards the end it was evident that\nthe two had quarrelled. The tears only came at the very end of all. It\nwas almost as if he had got through the passion and was glad to go.\nThen came regret, a regret that increased in geometrical proportion with\nevery mile of distance.\n\nIn Warsaw it was that grief really came to Prothero. He had some hours\nthere and he prowled the crowded streets, seeing girls and women happy\nwith their lovers, abroad upon bright expeditions and full of delicious\nsecrets, girls and women who ever and again flashed out some instant\nresemblance to Anna....\n\nIn Berlin he stopped a night and almost decided that he would go back.\n\"But now I had the damned frontier,\" he wrote, \"between us.\"\n\nIt was so entirely in the spirit of Prothero, Benham thought, to let the\n\"damned frontier\" tip the balance against him.\n\nThen came a scrawl of passionate confession, so passionate that it\nseemed as if Prothero had been transfigured. \"I can't stand this\nbusiness,\" he wrote. \"It has things in it, possibilities of emotional\ndisturbance--you can have no idea! In the train--luckily I was alone in\nthe compartment--I sat and thought, and suddenly, I could not help it,\nI was weeping--noisy weeping, an uproar! A beastly German came and\nstood in the corridor to stare. I had to get out of the train. It is\ndisgraceful, it is monstrous we should be made like this....\n\n\"Here I am stranded in Hanover with nothing to do but to write to you\nabout my dismal feelings....\"\n\nAfter that surely there was nothing before a broken-hearted Prothero but\nto go on with his trailing wing to Trinity and a life of inappeasable\nregrets; but again Benham reckoned without the invincible earthliness of\nhis friend. Prothero stayed three nights in Paris.\n\n\"There is an extraordinary excitement about Paris,\" he wrote. \"A levity.\nI suspect the gypsum in the subsoil--some as yet undescribed\nradiations. Suddenly the world looks brightly cynical.... None of those\ntear-compelling German emanations....\n\n\"And, Benham, I have found a friend.\n\n\"A woman. Of course you will laugh, you will sneer. You do not\nunderstand these things.... Yet they are so simple. It was the strangest\naccident brought us together. There was something that drew us together.\nA sort of instinct. Near the Boulevard Poissoniere....\"\n\n\"Good heavens!\" said Benham. \"A sort of instinct!\"\n\n\"I told her all about Anna!\"\n\n\"Good Lord!\" cried Benham.\n\n\"She understood. Perfectly. None of your so-called 'respectable' women\ncould have understood.... At first I intended merely to talk to her....\"\n\nBenham crumpled the letter in his hand.\n\n\"Little Anna Alexievna!\" he said, \"you were too clean for him.\"\n\n\n\n16\n\n\nBenham had a vision of Prothero returning from all this foreign travel\nmeekly, pensively, a little sadly, and yet not without a kind of relief,\nto the grey mildness of Trinity. He saw him, capped and gowned,\nand restored to academic dignity again, nodding greetings, resuming\nfriendships.\n\nThe little man merged again into his rare company of discreet Benedicts\nand restrained celibates at the high tables. They ate on in their mature\nwisdom long after the undergraduates had fled. Presently they would\nwithdraw processionally to the combination room....\n\nThere would be much to talk about over the wine.\n\nBenham speculated what account Prothero would give of Moscow....\n\nHe laughed abruptly.\n\nAnd with that laugh Prothero dropped out of Benham's world for a space\nof years. There may have been other letters, but if so they were lost\nin the heaving troubles of a revolution-strained post-office. Perhaps\nto this day they linger sere and yellow in some forgotten pigeon-hole in\nKishinev or Ekaterinoslav....\n\n\n\n17\n\n\nIn November, after an adventure in the trader's quarter of Kieff which\nhad brought him within an inch of death, and because an emotional wave\nhad swept across him and across his correspondence with Amanda, Benham\nwent back suddenly to England and her. He wanted very greatly to see her\nand also he wanted to make certain arrangements about his property. He\nreturned by way of Hungary, and sent telegrams like shouts of excitement\nwhenever the train stopped for a sufficient time. \"Old Leopard, I am\ncoming, I am coming,\" he telegraphed, announcing his coming for the\nfourth time. It was to be the briefest of visits, very passionate, the\nmutual refreshment of two noble lovers, and then he was returning to\nRussia again.\n\nAmanda was at Chexington, and there he found her installed in the utmost\ndignity of expectant maternity. Like many other people he had been a\nlittle disposed to regard the bearing of children as a common human\nexperience; at Chexington he came to think of it as a rare and\nsacramental function. Amanda had become very beautiful in quiet, grey,\ndove-like tones; her sun-touched, boy's complexion had given way to\na soft glow of the utmost loveliness, her brisk little neck that had\nalways reminded him of the stalk of a flower was now softened and\nrounded; her eyes were tender, and she moved about the place in the\nmanner of one who is vowed to a great sacrifice. She dominated the\nscene, and Lady Marayne, with a certain astonishment in her eyes and\na smouldering disposition to irony, was the half-sympathetic,\nhalf-resentful priestess of her daughter-in-law's unparalleled\nimmolation. The MOTIF of motherhood was everywhere, and at his bedside\nhe found--it had been put there for him by Amanda--among much\nother exaltation of woman's mission, that most wonderful of all\nphiloprogenitive stories, Hudson's CRYSTAL AGE.\n\nEverybody at Chexington had an air of being grouped about the impending\nfact. An epidemic of internal troubles, it is true, kept Sir Godfrey in\nthe depths of London society, but to make up for his absence Mrs. Morris\nhad taken a little cottage down by the river and the Wilder girls were\nwith her, both afire with fine and subtle feelings and both, it seemed,\nand more particularly Betty, prepared to be keenly critical of Benham's\nattitude.\n\nHe did a little miss his cue in these exaltations, because he had\nreturned in a rather different vein of exaltation.\n\nIn missing it he was assisted by Amanda herself, who had at moments an\neffect upon him of a priestess confidentially disrobed. It was as if she\nput aside for him something official, something sincerely maintained,\nnecessary, but at times a little irksome. It was as if she was glad to\ntake him into her confidence and unbend. Within the pre-natal Amanda an\nimpish Amanda still lingered.\n\nThere were aspects of Amanda that it was manifest dear Betty must never\nknow....\n\nBut the real Amanda of that November visit even in her most unpontifical\nmoods did not quite come up to the imagined Amanda who had drawn him\nhome across Europe. At times she was extraordinarily jolly. They had two\nor three happy walks about the Chexington woods; that year the golden\nweather of October had flowed over into November, and except for a\ncarpet of green and gold under the horse-chestnuts most of the leaves\nwere still on the trees. Gleams of her old wanton humour shone on him.\nAnd then would come something else, something like a shadow across the\nworld, something he had quite forgotten since his idea of heroic love\nhad flooded him, something that reminded him of those long explanations\nwith Mr. Rathbone-Sanders that had never been explained, and of the\ncurate in the doorway of the cottage and his unaccountable tears.\n\nOn the afternoon of his arrival at Chexington he was a little surprised\nto find Sir Philip Easton coming through the house into the garden, with\nan accustomed familiarity. Sir Philip perceived him with a start that\nwas instantly controlled, and greeted him with unnatural ease.\n\nSir Philip, it seemed, was fishing and reading and playing cricket in\nthe neighbourhood, which struck Benham as a poor way of spending the\nsummer, the sort of soft holiday a man learns to take from scholars\nand literary men. A man like Sir Philip, he thought, ought to have been\naviating or travelling.\n\nMoreover, when Sir Philip greeted Amanda it seemed to Benham that there\nwas a flavour of established association in their manner. But then Sir\nPhilip was also very assiduous with Lady Marayne. She called him \"Pip,\"\nand afterwards Amanda called across the tennis-court to him, \"Pip!\" And\nthen he called her \"Amanda.\" When the Wilder girls came up to join the\ntennis he was just as brotherly....\n\nThe next day he came to lunch.\n\nDuring that meal Benham became more aware than he had ever been before\nof the peculiar deep expressiveness of this young man's eyes. They\nwatched him and they watched Amanda with a solicitude that seemed at\nonce pained and tender. And there was something about Amanda, a kind\nof hard brightness, an impartiality and an air of something undefinably\nsuspended, that gave Benham an intuitive certitude that that afternoon\nSir Philip would be spoken to privately, and that then he would pack up\nand go away in a state of illumination from Chexington. But before he\ncould be spoken to he contrived to speak to Benham.\n\nThey were left to smoke after lunch, and then it was he took advantage\nof a pause to commit his little indiscretion.\n\n\"Mrs. Benham,\" he said, \"looks amazingly well--extraordinarily well,\ndon't you think?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Benham, startled. \"Yes. She certainly keeps very well.\"\n\n\"She misses you terribly,\" said Sir Philip; \"it is a time when a woman\nmisses her husband. But, of course, she does not want to hamper your\nwork....\"\n\nBenham felt it was very kind of him to take so intimate an interest in\nthese matters, but on the spur of the moment he could find no better\nexpression for this than a grunt.\n\n\"You don't mind,\" said the young man with a slight catch in the breath\nthat might have been apprehensive, \"that I sometimes bring her books and\nflowers and things? Do what little I can to keep life interesting down\nhere? It's not very congenial.... She's so wonderful--I think she is the\nmost wonderful woman in the world.\"\n\nBenham perceived that so far from being a modern aristocrat he was\nreally a primitive barbarian in these matters.\n\n\"I've no doubt,\" he said, \"that my wife has every reason to be grateful\nfor your attentions.\"\n\nIn the little pause that followed Benham had a feeling that Sir Philip\nwas engendering something still more personal. If so, he might\nbe constrained to invert very gently but very firmly the bowl of\nchrysanthemums over Sir Philip's head, or kick him in an improving\nmanner. He had a ridiculous belief that Sir Philip would probably take\nanything of the sort very touchingly. He scrambled in his mind for some\nremark that would avert this possibility.\n\n\"Have you ever been in Russia?\" he asked hastily. \"It is the most\nwonderful country in Europe. I had an odd adventure near Kiev. During a\npogrom.\"\n\nAnd he drowned the developing situation in a flood of description....\n\nBut it was not so easy to drown the little things that were presently\nthrown out by Lady Marayne. They were so much more in the air....\n\n\n\n18\n\n\nSir Philip suddenly got out of the picture even as Benham had foreseen.\n\n\"Easton has gone away,\" he remarked three days later to Amanda.\n\n\"I told him to go. He is a bore with you about. But otherwise he is\nrather a comfort, Cheetah.\" She meditated upon Sir Philip. \"And he's an\nHONOURABLE man,\" she said. \"He's safe....\"\n\n\n\n19\n\n\nAfter that visit it was that the notes upon love and sex began in\nearnest. The scattered memoranda upon the perfectness of heroic love for\nthe modern aristocrat ended abruptly. Instead there came the first draft\nfor a study of jealousy. The note was written in pencil on Chexington\nnotepaper and manifestly that had been supported on the ribbed cover\nof a book. There was a little computation in the corner, converting\nforty-five degrees Reaumur into degrees Fahrenheit, which made White\nguess it had been written in the Red Sea. But, indeed, it had been\nwritten in a rather amateurishly stoked corridor-train on Benham's\njourney to the gathering revolt in Moscow....\n\n\"I think I have been disposed to underrate the force of sexual\njealousy.... I thought it was something essentially contemptible,\nsomething that one dismissed and put behind oneself in the mere effort\nto be aristocratic, but I begin to realize that it is not quite so\neasily settled with....\n\n\"One likes to know.... Possibly one wants to know too much.... In phases\nof fatigue, and particularly in phases of sleeplessness, when one\nis leaving all that one cares for behind, it becomes an irrational\ntorment....\n\n\"And it is not only in oneself that I am astonished by the power of this\nbase motive. I see, too, in the queer business of Prothero how strongly\njealousy, how strongly the sense of proprietorship, weighs with a\nman....\n\n\"There is no clear reason why one should insist upon another human being\nbeing one's ownest own--utterly one's own....\n\n\"There is, of course, no clear reason for most human motives....\n\n\"One does....\n\n\"There is something dishonouring in distrust--to both the distrusted and\nthe one who distrusts....\"\n\nAfter that, apparently, it had been too hot and stuffy to continue.\n\n\n\n20\n\n\nBenham did not see Amanda again until after the birth of their child.\nHe spent his Christmas in Moscow, watching the outbreak, the fitful\nfighting and the subsequent break-up, of the revolution, and taking\ncare of a lost and helpless English family whose father had gone astray\ntemporarily on the way home from Baku. Then he went southward to Rostov\nand thence to Astrakhan. Here he really began his travels. He determined\nto get to India by way of Herat and for the first time in his life\nrode out into an altogether lawless wilderness. He went on obstinately\nbecause he found himself disposed to funk the journey, and because\ndiscouragements were put in his way. He was soon quite cut off from all\nthe ways of living he had known. He learnt what it is to be flea-bitten,\nsaddle-sore, hungry and, above all, thirsty. He was haunted by a dread\nof fever, and so contrived strange torments for himself with overdoses\nof quinine. He ceased to be traceable from Chexington in March, and he\nreappeared in the form of a telegram from Karachi demanding news in May.\nHe learnt he was the father of a man-child and that all was well with\nAmanda.\n\nHe had not expected to be so long away from any communication with the\nouter world, and something in the nature of a stricken conscience took\nhim back to England. He found a second William Porphyry in the world,\ndominating Chexington, and Amanda tenderly triumphant and passionate,\nthe Madonna enthroned. For William Porphyry he could feel no emotion.\nWilliam Porphyry was very red and ugly and protesting, feeble and\naggressive, a matter for a skilled nurse. To see him was to ignore him\nand dispel a dream. It was to Amanda Benham turned again.\n\nFor some days he was content to adore his Madonna and listen to the\nfamiliar flatteries of her love. He was a leaner, riper man, Amanda\nsaid, and wiser, so that she was afraid of him....\n\nAnd then he became aware that she was requiring him to stay at her side.\n\"We have both had our adventures,\" she said, which struck him as an odd\nphrase.\n\nIt forced itself upon his obstinate incredulity that all those\nconceptions of heroic love and faithfulness he had supposed to be so\nclearly understood between them had vanished from her mind. She had\nabsolutely forgotten that twilight moment at the window which had seemed\nto him the crowning instant, the real marriage of their lives. It\nhad gone, it had left no recoverable trace in her. And upon his\ninterpretations of that he had loved her passionately for a year. She\nwas back at exactly the ideas and intentions that ruled her during their\nfirst settlement in London. She wanted a joint life in the social world\nof London, she demanded his presence, his attention, the daily practical\nevidences of love. It was all very well for him to be away when the\nchild was coming, but now everything was different. Now he must stay by\nher.\n\nThis time he argued no case. These issues he had settled for ever. Even\nan indignant dissertation from Lady Marayne, a dissertation that began\nwith appeals and ended in taunts, did not move him. Behind these things\nnow was India. The huge problems of India had laid an unshakeable hold\nupon his imagination. He had seen Russia, and he wanted to balance that\npicture by a vision of the east....\n\nHe saw Easton only once during a week-end at Chexington. The young man\ndisplayed no further disposition to be confidentially sentimental. But\nhe seemed to have something on his mind. And Amanda said not a word\nabout him. He was a young man above suspicion, Benham felt....\n\nAnd from his departure the quality of the correspondence of these\ntwo larger carnivores began to change. Except for the repetition of\naccustomed endearments, they ceased to be love letters in any sense of\nthe word. They dealt chiefly with the \"Cub,\" and even there Benham felt\npresently that the enthusiasm diminished. A new amazing quality for\nAmanda appeared--triteness. The very writing of her letters changed\nas though it had suddenly lost backbone. Her habitual liveliness\nof phrasing lost its point. Had she lost her animation? Was she ill\nunknowingly? Where had the light gone? It was as if her attention was\ndistracted.... As if every day when she wrote her mind was busy about\nsomething else.\n\nAbruptly at last he understood. A fact that had never been stated,\nnever formulated, never in any way admitted, was suddenly pointed to\nconvergently by a thousand indicating fingers, and beyond question\nperceived to be THERE....\n\nHe left a record of that moment of realization.\n\n\"Suddenly one night I woke up and lay still, and it was as if I had\nnever seen Amanda before. Now I saw her plainly, I saw her with that\nsame dreadful clearness that sometimes comes at dawn, a pitiless, a\nscientific distinctness that has neither light nor shadow....\n\n\"Of course,\" I said, and then presently I got up very softly....\n\n\"I wanted to get out of my intolerable, close, personal cabin. I wanted\nto feel the largeness of the sky. I went out upon the deck. We were off\nthe coast of Madras, and when I think of that moment, there comes back\nto me also the faint flavour of spice in the air, the low line of the\ncoast, the cool flooding abundance of the Indian moonlight, the swish\nof the black water against the side of the ship. And a perception of\ninfinite loss, as if the limitless heavens above this earth and below\nto the very uttermost star were just one boundless cavity from which\ndelight had fled....\n\n\"Of course I had lost her. I knew it with absolute certainty. I knew it\nfrom her insecure temperament, her adventurousness, her needs. I knew it\nfrom every line she had written me in the last three months. I knew it\nintuitively. She had been unfaithful. She must have been unfaithful.\n\n\"What had I been dreaming about to think that it would not be so?\"\n\n\n\n21\n\n\n\"Now let me write down plainly what I think of these matters. Let me\nbe at least honest with myself, whatever self-contradictions I may\nhave been led into by force of my passions. Always I have despised\njealousy....\n\n\"Only by the conquest of four natural limitations is the aristocratic\nlife to be achieved. They come in a certain order, and in that order the\nspirit of man is armed against them less and less efficiently. Of fear\nand my struggle against fear I have told already. I am fearful. I am a\nphysical coward until I can bring shame and anger to my assistance,\nbut in overcoming fear I have been helped by the whole body of human\ntradition. Every one, the basest creatures, every Hottentot, every\nstunted creature that ever breathed poison in a slum, knows that the\ninstinctive constitution of man is at fault here and that fear is\nshameful and must be subdued. The race is on one's side. And so there is\na vast traditional support for a man against the Second Limitation, the\nlimitation of physical indulgence. It is not so universal as the first,\nthere is a grinning bawling humour on the side of grossness, but common\npride is against it. And in this matter my temperament has been my help:\nI am fastidious, I eat little, drink little, and feel a shivering recoil\nfrom excess. It is no great virtue; it happens so; it is something in\nthe nerves of my skin. I cannot endure myself unshaven or in any way\nunclean; I am tormented by dirty hands or dirty blood or dirty memories,\nand after I had once loved Amanda I could not--unless some irrational\nimpulse to get equal with her had caught me--have broken my faith to\nher, whatever breach there was in her faith to me....\n\n\"I see that in these matters I am cleaner than most men and more easily\nclean; and it may be that it is in the vein of just that distinctive\nvirtue that I fell so readily into a passion of resentment and anger.\n\n\"I despised a jealous man. There is a traditional discredit of jealousy,\nnot so strong as that against cowardice, but still very strong. But\nthe general contempt of jealousy is curiously wrapped up with the\nsupposition that there is no cause for jealousy, that it is unreasonable\nsuspicion. Given a cause then tradition speaks with an uncertain\nvoice....\n\n\"I see now that I despised jealousy because I assumed that it was\nimpossible for Amanda to love any one but me; it was intolerable\nto imagine anything else, I insisted upon believing that she was as\nfastidious as myself and as faithful as myself, made indeed after my\nimage, and I went on disregarding the most obvious intimations that she\nwas not, until that still moment in the Indian Ocean, when silently,\ngently as a drowned body might rise out of the depths of a pool, that\nknowledge of love dead and honour gone for ever floated up into my\nconsciousness.\n\n\"And then I felt that Amanda had cheated me! Outrageously. Abominably.\n\n\"Now, so far as my intelligence goes, there is not a cloud upon this\nquestion. My demand upon Amanda was outrageous and I had no right\nwhatever to her love or loyalty. I must have that very clear....\n\n\"This aristocratic life, as I conceive it, must be, except accidentally\nhere and there, incompatible with the domestic life. It means going\nhither and thither in the universe of thought as much as in the universe\nof matter, it means adventure, it means movement and adventure that must\nneeds be hopelessly encumbered by an inseparable associate, it means\nself-imposed responsibilities that will not fit into the welfare of a\nfamily. In all ages, directly society had risen above the level of a\nbarbaric tribal village, this need of a release from the family for\ncertain necessary types of people has been recognized. It was\nmet sometimes informally, sometimes formally, by the growth and\nestablishment of special classes and orders, of priests, monks, nuns, of\npledged knights, of a great variety of non-family people, whose\nconcern was the larger collective life that opens out beyond the\nsimple necessities and duties and loyalties of the steading and of the\ncraftsman's house. Sometimes, but not always, that release took the form\nof celibacy; but besides that there have been a hundred institutional\nvariations of the common life to meet the need of the special man,\nthe man who must go deep and the man who must go far. A vowed celibacy\nceased to be a tolerable rule for an aristocracy directly the eugenic\nidea entered the mind of man, because a celibate aristocracy means the\nabandonment of the racial future to a proletariat of base unleaderly\nmen. That was plain to Plato. It was plain to Campanelea. It was plain\nto the Protestant reformers. But the world has never yet gone on to\nthe next step beyond that recognition, to the recognition of feminine\naristocrats, rulers and the mates of rulers, as untrammelled by domestic\nservitudes and family relationships as the men of their kind. That I see\nhas always been my idea since in my undergraduate days I came under the\nspell of Plato. It was a matter of course that my first gift to Amanda\nshould be his REPUBLIC. I loved Amanda transfigured in that dream....\n\n\"There are no such women....\n\n\"It is no excuse for me that I thought she was like-minded with myself.\nI had no sound reason for supposing that. I did suppose that. I did not\nperceive that not only was she younger than myself, but that while I\nhad been going through a mill of steely education, kept close, severely\nexercised, polished by discussion, she had but the weak training of a\nnot very good school, some scrappy reading, the vague discussions\nof village artists, and the draped and decorated novelties of the\n'advanced.' It all went to nothing on the impact of the world.... She\nshowed herself the woman the world has always known, no miracle, and\nthe alternative was for me to give myself to her in the ancient way, to\nserve her happiness, to control her and delight and companion her, or to\nlet her go.\n\n\"The normal woman centres upon herself; her mission is her own charm and\nher own beauty and her own setting; her place is her home. She demands\nthe concentration of a man. Not to be able to command that is her\nfailure. Not to give her that is to shame her. As I had shamed\nAmanda....\"\n\n\n\n22\n\n\n\"There are no such women.\" He had written this in and struck it out, and\nthen at some later time written it in again. There it stayed now as his\nlast persuasion, but it set White thinking and doubting. And, indeed,\nthere was another sheet of pencilled broken stuff that seemed to glance\nat quite another type of womanhood.\n\n\n\n23\n\n\n\"It is clear that the women aristocrats who must come to the remaking of\nthe world will do so in spite of limitations at least as great as those\nfrom which the aristocratic spirit of man escapes. These women must\nbecome aristocratic through their own innate impulse, they must be\nself-called to their lives, exactly as men must be; there is no making\nan aristocrat without a predisposition for rule and nobility. And they\nhave to discover and struggle against just exactly the limitations that\nwe have to struggle against. They have to conquer not only fear\nbut indulgence, indulgence of a softer, more insidious quality, and\njealousy--proprietorship....\n\n\"It is as natural to want a mate as to want bread, and a thousand times\nin my work and in my wanderings I have thought of a mate and desired a\nmate. A mate--not a possession. It is a need almost naively simple. If\nonly one could have a woman who thought of one and with one! Though\nshe were on the other side of the world and busied about a thousand\nthings....\n\n\"'WITH one,' I see it must be rather than 'OF one.' That 'of one' is\njust the unexpurgated egotistical demand coming back again....\n\n\"Man is a mating creature. It is not good to be alone. But mating means\na mate....\n\n\"We should be lovers, of course; that goes without saying....\n\n\"And yet not specialized lovers, not devoted, ATTENDING lovers. 'Dancing\nattendance'--as they used to say. We should meet upon our ways as the\ngreat carnivores do....\n\n\"That at any rate was a sound idea. Though we only played with it.\n\n\"But that mate desire is just a longing that can have no possible\nsatisfaction now for me. What is the good of dreaming? Life and chance\nhave played a trick upon my body and soul. I am mated, though I am\nmated to a phantom. I loved and I love Arnanda, not Easton's Amanda, but\nAmanda in armour, the Amanda of my dreams. Sense, and particularly the\nsense of beauty, lies deeper than reason in us. There can be no mate\nfor me now unless she comes with Amanda's voice and Amanda's face and\nAmanda's quick movements and her clever hands....\"\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n\"Why am I so ungrateful to her still for all the happiness she gave me?\n\n\"There were things between us two as lovers,--love, things more\nbeautiful than anything else in the world, things that set the mind\nhunting among ineffectual images in a search for impossible expression,\nimages of sunlight shining through blood-red petals, images of moonlight\nin a scented garden, of marble gleaming in the shade, of far-off\nwonderful music heard at dusk in a great stillness, of fairies dancing\nsoftly, of floating happiness and stirring delights, of joys as keen and\nsudden as the knife of an assassin, assassin's knives made out of tears,\ntears that are happiness, wordless things; and surprises, expectations,\ngratitudes, sudden moments of contemplation, the sight of a soft\neyelid closed in sleep, shadowy tones in the sound of a voice heard\nunexpectedly; sweet, dear magical things that I can find no words\nfor....\n\n\"If she was a goddess to me, should it be any affair of mine that she\nwas not a goddess to herself; that she could hold all this that has been\nbetween us more cheaply than I did? It does not change one jot of it for\nme. At the time she did not hold it cheaply. She forgets where I do not\nforget....\"\n\n\n\n25\n\n\nSuch were the things that Benham could think and set down.\n\nYet for whole days he was possessed by the thought of killing Amanda and\nhimself.\n\nHe did not at once turn homeward. It was in Ceylon that he dropped his\nwork and came home. At Colombo he found a heap of letters awaiting him,\nand there were two of these that had started at the same time. They had\nbeen posted in London on one eventful afternoon. Lady Marayne and Amanda\nhad quarrelled violently. Two earnest, flushed, quick-breathing women,\nfull of neat but belated repartee, separated to write their simultaneous\nletters. Each letter trailed the atmosphere of that truncated encounter.\nLady Marayne told her story ruthlessly. Amanda, on the other hand,\ngeneralized, and explained. Sir Philip's adoration of her was a\nlove-friendship, it was beautiful, it was pure. Was there no trust nor\ncourage in the world? She would defy all jealous scandal. She would not\neven banish him from her side. Surely the Cheetah could trust her. But\nthe pitiless facts of Lady Marayne went beyond Amanda's explaining. The\nlittle lady's dignity had been stricken. \"I have been used as a cloak,\"\nshe wrote.\n\nHer phrases were vivid. She quoted the very words of Amanda, words she\nhad overheard at Chexington in the twilight. They were no invention.\nThey were the very essence of Amanda, the lover. It was as sure as if\nBenham had heard the sound of her voice, as if he had peeped and seen,\nas if she had crept by him, stooping and rustling softly. It brought\nback the living sense of her, excited, flushed, reckless; his\nwild-haired Amanda of infinite delight.... All day those words of hers\npursued him. All night they flared across the black universe. He buried\nhis face in the pillows and they whispered softly in his ear.\n\nHe walked his room in the darkness longing to smash and tear.\n\nHe went out from the house and shook his ineffectual fists at the\nstirring quiet of the stars.\n\nHe sent no notice of his coming back. Nor did he come back with a\ndefinite plan. But he wanted to get at Amanda.\n\n\n\n26\n\n\nIt was with Amanda he had to reckon. Towards Easton he felt scarcely any\nanger at all. Easton he felt only existed for him because Amanda willed\nto have it so.\n\nSuch anger as Easton did arouse in him was a contemptuous anger. His\ndevotion filled Benham with scorn. His determination to serve Amanda at\nany price, to bear the grossest humiliations and slights for her,\nhis humility, his service and tenderness, his care for her moods and\nhappiness, seemed to Benham a treachery to human nobility. That rage\nagainst Easton was like the rage of a trade-unionist against a blackleg.\nAre all the women to fall to the men who will be their master-slaves and\nkeepers? But it was not simply that Benham felt men must be freed from\nthis incessant attendance; women too must free themselves from their\nalmost instinctive demand for an attendant....\n\nHis innate disposition was to treat women as responsible beings. Never\nin his life had he thought of a woman as a pretty thing to be fooled and\nwon and competed for and fought over. So that it was Amanda he wanted\nto reach and reckon with now, Amanda who had mated and ruled his senses\nonly to fling him into this intolerable pit of shame and jealous fury.\nBut the forces that were driving him home now were the forces below the\nlevel of reason and ideas, organic forces compounded of hate and desire,\nprofound aboriginal urgencies. He thought, indeed, very little as he\nlay in his berth or sulked on deck; his mind lay waste under a pitiless\ninvasion of exasperating images that ever and again would so wring him\nthat his muscles would tighten and his hands clench or he would find\nhimself restraining a snarl, the threat of the beast, in his throat.\n\nAmanda grew upon his imagination until she overshadowed the whole world.\nShe filled the skies. She bent over him and mocked him. She became a\nmystery of passion and dark beauty. She was the sin of the world. One\nbreathed her in the winds of the sea. She had taken to herself the\ngreatness of elemental things....\n\nSo that when at last he saw her he was amazed to see her, and see that\nshe was just a creature of common size and quality, a rather tired and\nvery frightened-looking white-faced young woman, in an evening-dress of\nunfamiliar fashion, with little common trinkets of gold and colour about\nher wrists and neck.\n\nIn that instant's confrontation he forgot all that had brought him\nhomeward. He stared at her as one stares at a stranger whom one has\ngreeted in mistake for an intimate friend.\n\nFor he saw that she was no more the Amanda he hated and desired to kill\nthan she had ever been the Amanda he had loved.\n\n\n\n27\n\n\nHe took them by surprise. It had been his intention to take them by\nsurprise. Such is the inelegance of the jealous state.\n\nHe reached London in the afternoon and put up at a hotel near Charing\nCross. In the evening about ten he appeared at the house in Lancaster\nGate. The butler was deferentially amazed. Mrs. Benham was, he said, at\na theatre with Sir Philip Easton, and he thought some other people also.\nHe did not know when she would be back. She might go on to supper. It\nwas not the custom for the servants to wait up for her.\n\nBenham went into the study that reduplicated his former rooms in Finacue\nStreet and sat down before the fire the butler lit for him. He sent the\nman to bed, and fell into profound meditation.\n\nIt was nearly two o'clock when he heard the sound of her latchkey and\nwent out at once upon the landing.\n\nThe half-door stood open and Easton's car was outside. She stood in\nthe middle of the hall and relieved Easton of the gloves and fan he was\ncarrying.\n\n\"Good-night,\" she said, \"I am so tired.\"\n\n\"My wonderful goddess,\" he said.\n\nShe yielded herself to his accustomed embrace, then started, stared, and\nwrenched herself out of his arms.\n\nBenham stood at the top of the stairs looking down upon them,\nwhite-faced and inexpressive. Easton dropped back a pace. For a moment\nno one moved nor spoke, and then very quietly Easton shut the half-door\nand shut out the noises of the road.\n\nFor some seconds Benham regarded them, and as he did so his spirit\nchanged....\n\nEverything he had thought of saying and doing vanished out of his mind.\n\nHe stuck his hands into his pockets and descended the staircase. When\nhe was five or six steps above them, he spoke. \"Just sit down here,\" he\nsaid, with a gesture of one hand, and sat down himself upon the stairs.\n\"DO sit down,\" he said with a sudden testiness as they continued\nstanding. \"I know all about this affair. Do please sit down and let us\ntalk.... Everybody's gone to bed long ago.\"\n\n\"Cheetah!\" she said. \"Why have you come back like this?\"\n\nThen at his mute gesture she sat down at his feet.\n\n\"I wish you would sit down, Easton,\" he said in a voice of subdued\nsavagery.\n\n\"Why have you come back?\" Sir Philip Easton found his voice to ask.\n\n\"SIT down,\" Benham spat, and Easton obeyed unwillingly.\n\n\"I came back,\" Benham went on, \"to see to all this. Why else? I\ndon't--now I see you--feel very fierce about it. But it has distressed\nme. You look changed, Amanda, and fagged. And your hair is untidy. It's\nas if something had happened to you and made you a stranger.... You two\npeople are lovers. Very natural and simple, but I want to get out of it.\nYes, I want to get out of it. That wasn't quite my idea, but now I see\nit is. It's queer, but on the whole I feel sorry for you. All of us,\npoor humans--. There's reason to be sorry for all of us. We're full\nof lusts and uneasiness and resentments that we haven't the will to\ncontrol. What do you two people want me to do to you? Would you like a\ndivorce, Amanda? It's the clean, straight thing, isn't it? Or would the\nscandal hurt you?\"\n\nAmanda sat crouched together, with her eyes on Benham.\n\n\"Give us a divorce,\" said Easton, looking to her to confirm him.\n\nAmanda shook her head.\n\n\"I don't want a divorce,\" she said.\n\n\"Then what do you want?\" asked Benham with sudden asperity.\n\n\"I don't want a divorce,\" she repeated. \"Why do you, after a long\nsilence, come home like this, abruptly, with no notice?\"\n\n\"It was the way it took me,\" said Benham, after a little interval.\n\n\"You have left me for long months.\"\n\n\"Yes. I was angry. And it was ridiculous to be angry. I thought I wanted\nto kill you, and now I see you I see that all I want to do is to help\nyou out of this miserable mess--and then get away from you. You two\nwould like to marry. You ought to be married.\"\n\n\"I would die to make Amanda happy,\" said Easton.\n\n\"Your business, it seems to me, is to live to make her happy. That you\nmay find more of a strain. Less tragic and more tiresome. I, on the\nother hand, want neither to die nor live for her.\" Amanda moved sharply.\n\"It's extraordinary what amazing vapours a lonely man may get into his\nhead. If you don't want a divorce then I suppose things might go on as\nthey are now.\"\n\n\"I hate things as they are now,\" said Easton. \"I hate this falsehood and\ndeception.\"\n\n\"You would hate the scandal just as much,\" said Amanda.\n\n\"I would not care what the scandal was unless it hurt you.\"\n\n\"It would be only a temporary inconvenience,\" said Benham. \"Every one\nwould sympathize with you.... The whole thing is so natural.... People\nwould be glad to forget very soon. They did with my mother.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Amanda, \"it isn't so easy as that.\"\n\nShe seemed to come to a decision.\n\n\"Pip,\" she said. \"I want to talk to--HIM--alone.\"\n\nEaston's brown eyes were filled with distress and perplexity. \"But why?\"\nhe asked.\n\n\"I do,\" she said.\n\n\"But this is a thing for US.\"\n\n\"Pip, I want to talk to him alone. There is something--something I can't\nsay before you....\"\n\nSir Philip rose slowly to his feet.\n\n\"Shall I wait outside?\"\n\n\"No, Pip. Go home. Yes,--there are some things you must leave to me.\"\n\nShe stood up too and turned so that she and Benham both faced the\nyounger man. The strangest uneasiness mingled with his resolve to be\nat any cost splendid. He felt--and it was a most unexpected and\ndisconcerting feeling--that he was no longer confederated with Amanda;\nthat prior, more fundamental and greater associations prevailed over his\nlittle new grip upon her mind and senses. He stared at husband and wife\naghast in this realization. Then his resolute romanticism came to his\nhelp. \"I would trust you--\" he began. \"If you tell me to go--\"\n\nAmanda seemed to measure her hold upon him.\n\nShe laid her hand upon his arm. \"Go, my dear Pip,\" she said. \"Go.\"\n\nHe had a moment of hesitation, of anguish, and it seemed to Benham\nas though he eked himself out with unreality, as though somewhen,\nsomewhere, he had seen something of the sort in a play and filled in a\ngap that otherwise he could not have supplied.\n\nThen the door had closed upon him, and Amanda, pale and darkly\ndishevelled, faced her husband, silently and intensely.\n\n\"WELL?\" said Benham.\n\nShe held out her arms to him.\n\n\"Why did you leave me, Cheetah? Why did you leave me?\"\n\n\n\n28\n\n\nBenham affected to ignore those proffered arms. But they recalled in\na swift rush the animal anger that had brought him back to England.\nTo remind him of desire now was to revive an anger stronger than any\ndesire. He spoke seeking to hurt her.\n\n\"I am wondering now,\" he said, \"why the devil I came back.\"\n\n\"You had to come back to me.\"\n\n\"I could have written just as well about these things.\"\n\n\"CHEETAH,\" she said softly, and came towards him slowly, stooping\nforward and looking into his eyes, \"you had to come back to see your old\nLeopard. Your wretched Leopard. Who has rolled in the dirt. And is still\nyours.\"\n\n\"Do you want a divorce? How are we to fix things, Amanda?\"\n\n\"Cheetah, I will tell you how we will fix things.\"\n\nShe dropped upon the step below him. She laid her hands with a\ndeliberate softness upon him, she gave a toss so that her disordered\nhair was a little more disordered, and brought her soft chin down to\ntouch his knees. Her eyes implored him.\n\n\"Cheetah,\" she said. \"You are going to forgive.\"\n\nHe sat rigid, meeting her eyes.\n\n\"Amanda,\" he said at last, \"you would be astonished if I kicked you away\nfrom me and trampled over you to the door. That is what I want to do.\"\n\n\"Do it,\" she said, and the grip of her hands tightened. \"Cheetah, dear!\nI would love you to kill me.\"\n\n\"I don't want to kill you.\"\n\nHer eyes dilated. \"Beat me.\"\n\n\"And I haven't the remotest intention of making love to you,\" he said,\nand pushed her soft face and hands away from him as if he would stand\nup.\n\nShe caught hold of him again. \"Stay with me,\" she said.\n\nHe made no effort to shake off her grip. He looked at the dark cloud of\nher hair that had ruled him so magically, and the memory of old delights\nmade him grip a great handful almost inadvertently as he spoke. \"Dear\nLeopard,\" he said, \"we humans are the most streaky of conceivable\nthings. I thought I hated you. I do. I hate you like poison. And also I\ndo not hate you at all.\"\n\nThen abruptly he was standing over her.\n\nShe rose to her knees.\n\n\"Stay here, old Cheetah!\" she said. \"This is your house. I am your\nwife.\"\n\nHe went towards the unfastened front door.\n\n\"Cheetah!\" she cried with a note of despair.\n\nHe halted at the door.\n\n\"Amanda, I will come to-morrow. I will come in the morning, in the sober\nLondon daylight, and then we will settle things.\"\n\nHe stared at her, and to her amazement he smiled. He spoke as one who\nremarks upon a quite unexpected fact....\n\n\"Never in my life, Amanda, have I seen a human being that I wanted so\nlittle to kill.\"\n\n\n\n29\n\n\nWhite found a fragment that might have been written within a week of\nthose last encounters of Benham and Amanda.\n\n\"The thing that astonished me most in Amanda was the change in her\nmental quality.\n\n\"With me in the old days she had always been a sincere person; she had\ndeceived me about facts, but she had never deceived me about herself.\nHer personal, stark frankness had been her essential strength. And it\nwas gone. I came back to find Amanda an accomplished actress, a thing\nof poses and calculated effects. She was a surface, a sham, a Lorelei.\nBeneath that surface I could not discover anything individual at all.\nFear and a grasping quality, such as God gave us all when he gave us\nhands; but the individual I knew, the humorous wilful Spotless Leopard\nwas gone. Whither, I cannot imagine. An amazing disappearance. Clean out\nof space and time like a soul lost for ever.\n\n\"When I went to see her in the morning, she was made up for a scene, she\nacted an intricate part, never for a moment was she there in reality....\n\n\"I have got a remarkable persuasion that she lost herself in this way,\nby cheapening love, by making base love to a lover she despised....\nThere can be no inequality in love. Give and take must balance. One must\nbe one's natural self or the whole business is an indecent trick, a vile\nuse of life! To use inferiors in love one must needs talk down to\nthem, interpret oneself in their insufficient phrases, pretend,\nsentimentalize. And it is clear that unless oneself is to be lost, one\nmust be content to leave alone all those people that one can reach\nonly by sentimentalizing. But Amanda--and yet somehow I love her for\nit still--could not leave any one alone. So she was always feverishly\nweaving nets of false relationship. Until her very self was forgotten.\nSo she will go on until the end. With Easton it had been necessary for\nher to key herself to a simple exalted romanticism that was entirely\ninsincere. She had so accustomed herself to these poses that her innate\ngestures were forgotten. She could not recover them; she could not\neven reinvent them. Between us there were momentary gleams as though\npresently we should be our frank former selves again. They were never\nmore than momentary....\"\n\nAnd that was all that this astonishing man had seen fit to tell of his\nlast parting from his wife.\n\nPerhaps he did Amanda injustice. Perhaps there was a stronger thread\nof reality in her desire to recover him than he supposed. Clearly he\nbelieved that under the circumstances Amanda would have tried to recover\nanybody.\n\nShe had dressed for that morning's encounter in a very becoming and\nintimate wrap of soft mauve and white silk, and she had washed and dried\nher dark hair so that it was a vapour about her face. She set herself\nwith a single mind to persuade herself and Benham that they were\ninseparable lovers, and she would not be deflected by his grim\ndetermination to discuss the conditions of their separation. When he\nasked her whether she wanted a divorce, she offered to throw over\nSir Philip and banish him for ever as lightly as a great lady might\nsacrifice an objectionable poodle to her connubial peace.\n\nBenham passed through perplexing phases, so that she herself began to\nfeel that her practice with Easton had spoilt her hands. His initial\ngrimness she could understand, and partially its breakdown into\nirritability. But she was puzzled by his laughter. For he laughed\nabruptly.\n\n\"You know, Amanda, I came home in a mood of tremendous tragedy. And\nreally,--you are a Lark.\"\n\nAnd then overriding her altogether, he told her what he meant to do\nabout their future and the future of their little son.\n\n\"You don't want a divorce and a fuss. Then I'll leave things. I perceive\nI've no intention of marrying any more. But you'd better do the straight\nthing. People forget and forgive. Especially when there is no one about\nmaking a fuss against you.\n\n\"Perhaps, after all, there is something to be said for shirking it.\nWe'll both be able to get at the boy then. You'll not hurt him, and\nI shall want to see him. It's better for the boy anyhow not to have a\ndivorce.\n\n\"I'll not stand in your way. I'll get a little flat and I shan't come\ntoo much to London, and when I do, you can get out of town. You must be\ndiscreet about Easton, and if people say anything about him, send them\nto me. After all, this is our private affair.\n\n\"We'll go on about money matters as we have been going. I trust to you\nnot to run me into overwhelming debts. And, of course, if at any time,\nyou do want to marry--on account of children or anything--if nobody\nknows of this conversation we can be divorced then....\"\n\nBenham threw out these decisions in little dry sentences while Amanda\ngathered her forces for her last appeal.\n\nIt was an unsuccessful appeal, and at the end she flung herself down\nbefore him and clung to his knees. He struggled ridiculously to get\nhimself clear, and when at last he succeeded she dropped prostrate on\nthe floor with her dishevelled hair about her.\n\nShe heard the door close behind him, and still she lay there, a dark\nGuinevere, until with a start she heard a step upon the thick carpet\nwithout. He had come back. The door reopened. There was a slight pause,\nand then she raised her face and met the blank stare of the second\nhousemaid. There are moments, suspended fragments of time rather than\nlinks in its succession, when the human eye is more intelligible than\nany words.\n\nThe housemaid made a rapid apologetic noise and vanished with a click of\nthe door.\n\n\"DAMN!\" said Amanda.\n\nThen slowly she rose to her knees.\n\nShe meditated through vast moments.\n\n\"It's a cursed thing to be a woman,\" said Amanda. She stood up. She put\nher hand on the telephone in the corner and then she forgot about it.\nAfter another long interval of thought she spoke.\n\n\"Cheetah!\" she said, \"Old Cheetah!...\n\n\"I didn't THINK it of you....\"\n\nThen presently with the even joyless movements of one who does a\nreasonable business, with something indeed of the manner of one who\npacks a trunk, she rang up Sir Philip Easton.\n\n\n\n30\n\n\nThe head chambermaid on the first floor of the Westwood Hotel in\nDanebury Street had a curious and perplexing glimpse of Benham's private\nprocesses the morning after this affair.\n\nBenham had taken Room 27 on the afternoon of his return to London. She\nhad seen him twice or three times, and he had struck her as a coldly\ndecorous person, tall, white-faced, slow speaking; the last man to\nbehave violently or surprise a head chambermaid in any way. On the\nmorning of his departure she was told by the first-floor waiter that the\noccupant of Room 26 had complained of an uproar in the night, and almost\nimmediately she was summoned to see Benham.\n\nHe was standing facing the door and in a position which did a little\nobscure the condition of the room behind him. He was carefully dressed,\nand his manner was more cold and decorous than ever. But one of his\nhands was tied up in a white bandage.\n\n\"I am going this morning,\" he said, \"I am going down now to breakfast. I\nhave had a few little accidents with some of the things in the room and\nI have cut my hand. I want you to tell the manager and see that they are\nproperly charged for on the bill.... Thank you.\"\n\nThe head chambermaid was left to consider the accidents.\n\nBenham's things were all packed up and the room had an air of having\nbeen straightened up neatly and methodically after a destructive\ncataclysm. One or two items that the chambermaid might possibly have\noverlooked in the normal course of things were carefully exhibited. For\nexample, the sheet had been torn into half a dozen strips and they were\nlying side by side on the bed. The clock on the mantelpiece had\nbeen knocked into the fireplace and then pounded to pieces. All the\nlooking-glasses in the room were smashed, apparently the electric lamp\nthat stood on the night table by the bedside had been wrenched off and\nflung or hammered about amidst the other breakables. And there was\na considerable amount of blood splashed about the room. The head\nchambermaid felt unequal to the perplexities of the spectacle and\nsummoned her most convenient friend, the head chambermaid on the third\nfloor, to her aid. The first-floor waiter joined their deliberations\nand several housemaids displayed a respectful interest in the matter.\nFinally they invoked the manager. He was still contemplating the scene\nof the disorder when the precipitate retreat of his subordinates warned\nhim of Benham's return.\n\nBenham was smoking a cigarette and his bearing was reassuringly\ntranquil.\n\n\"I had a kind of nightmare,\" he said. \"I am fearfully sorry to have\ndisarranged your room. You must charge me for the inconvenience as well\nas for the damage.\"\n\n\n\n31\n\n\n\"An aristocrat cannot be a lover.\"\n\n\"One cannot serve at once the intricacies of the wider issues of life\nand the intricacies of another human being. I do not mean that one may\nnot love. One loves the more because one does not concentrate one's\nlove. One loves nations, the people passing in the street, beasts hurt\nby the wayside, troubled scoundrels and university dons in tears....\n\n\"But if one does not give one's whole love and life into a woman's hands\nI do not think one can expect to be loved.\n\n\"An aristocrat must do without close personal love....\"\n\nThis much was written at the top of a sheet of paper. The writing ended\nhalfway down the page. Manifestly it was an abandoned beginning. And it\nwas, it seemed to White, the last page of all this confusion of matter\nthat dealt with the Second and Third Limitations. Its incompleteness\nmade its expression perfect....\n\nThere Benham's love experience ended. He turned to the great business\nof the world. Desire and Jealousy should deflect his life no more; like\nFear they were to be dismissed as far as possible and subdued when\nthey could not be altogether dismissed. Whatever stirrings of blood or\nimagination there were in him after that parting, whatever failures from\nthis resolution, they left no trace on the rest of his research, which\nwas concerned with the hates of peoples and classes and war and peace\nand the possibilities science unveils and starry speculations of what\nmankind may do.\n\n\n\n32\n\n\nBut Benham did not leave England again until he had had an encounter\nwith Lady Marayne.\n\nThe little lady came to her son in a state of extraordinary anger and\ndistress. Never had she seemed quite so resolute nor quite so hopelessly\ndispersed and mixed. And when for a moment it seemed to him that she was\nnot as a matter of fact dispersed and mixed at all, then with an instant\neagerness he dismissed that one elucidatory gleam. \"What are you doing\nin England, Poff?\" she demanded. \"And what are you going to do?\n\n\"Nothing! And you are going to leave her in your house, with your\nproperty and a lover. If that's it, Poff, why did you ever come back?\nAnd why did you ever marry her? You might have known; her father was a\nswindler. She's begotten of deceit. She'll tell her own story while you\nare away, and a pretty story she'll make of it.\"\n\n\"Do you want me to divorce her and make a scandal?\"\n\n\"I never wanted you to go away from her. If you'd stayed and watched her\nas a man should, as I begged you and implored you to do. Didn't I tell\nyou, Poff? Didn't I warn you?\"\n\n\"But now what am I to do?\"\n\n\"There you are! That's just a man's way. You get yourself into this\ntrouble, you follow your passions and your fancies and fads and then\nyou turn to me! How can I help you now, Poff? If you'd listened to me\nbefore!\"\n\nHer blue eyes were demonstratively round.\n\n\"Yes, but--\"\n\n\"I warned you,\" she interrupted. \"I warned you. I've done all I could\nfor you. It isn't that I haven't seen through her. When she came to me\nat first with that made-up story of a baby! And all about loving me like\nher own mother. But I did what I could. I thought we might still make\nthe best of a bad job. And then--. I might have known she couldn't leave\nPip alone.... But for weeks I didn't dream. I wouldn't dream. Right\nunder my nose. The impudence of it!\"\n\nHer voice broke. \"Such a horrid mess! Such a hopeless, horrid mess!\"\n\nShe wiped away a bright little tear....\n\n\"It's all alike. It's your way with us. All of you. There isn't a man\nin the world deserves to have a woman in the world. We do all we can\nfor you. We do all we can to amuse you, we dress for you and we talk for\nyou. All the sweet, warm little women there are! And then you go away\nfrom us! There never was a woman yet who pleased and satisfied a man,\nwho did not lose him. Give you everything and off you must go! Lovers,\nmothers....\"\n\nIt dawned upon Benham dimly that his mother's troubles did not deal\nexclusively with himself.\n\n\"But Amanda,\" he began.\n\n\"If you'd looked after her properly, it would have been right enough.\nPip was as good as gold until she undermined him.... A woman can't wait\nabout like an umbrella in a stand.... He was just a boy.... Only of\ncourse there she was--a novelty. It is perfectly easy to understand. She\nflattered him.... Men are such fools.\"\n\n\"Still--it's no good saying that now.\"\n\n\"But she'll spend all your money, Poff! She'll break your back with\ndebts. What's to prevent her? With him living on her! For that's what it\ncomes to practically.\"\n\n\"Well, what am I to do?\"\n\n\"You aren't going back without tying her up, Poff? You ought to stop\nevery farthing of her money--every farthing. It's your duty.\"\n\n\"I can't do things like that.\"\n\n\"But have you no Shame? To let that sort of thing go on!\"\n\n\"If I don't feel the Shame of it-- And I don't.\"\n\n\"And that money--. I got you that money, Poff! It was my money.\"\n\nBenham stared at her perplexed. \"What am I to do?\" he asked.\n\n\"Cut her off, you silly boy! Tie her up! Pay her through a solicitor.\nSay that if she sees him ONCE again--\"\n\nHe reflected. \"No,\" he said at last.\n\n\"Poff!\" she cried, \"every time I see you, you are more and more like\nyour father. You're going off--just as he did. That baffled, MULISH\nlook--priggish--solemn! Oh! it's strange the stuff a poor woman has to\nbring into the world. But you'll do nothing. I know you'll do nothing.\nYou'll stand everything. You--you Cuckold! And she'll drive by me,\nshe'll pass me in theatres with the money that ought to have been mine!\nOh! Oh!\"\n\nShe dabbed her handkerchief from one swimming eye to the other. But she\nwent on talking. Faster and faster, less and less coherently; more and\nmore wildly abusive. Presently in a brief pause of the storm Benham\nsighed profoundly....\n\nIt brought the scene to a painful end....\n\nFor weeks her distress pursued and perplexed him.\n\nHe had an extraordinary persuasion that in some obscure way he was in\ndefault, that he was to blame for her distress, that he owed her--he\ncould never define what he owed her.\n\nAnd yet, what on earth was one to do?\n\nAnd something his mother had said gave him the odd idea that he had\nmisjudged his father, that he had missed depths of perplexed and kindred\ngoodwill. He went down to see him before he returned to India. But if\nthere was a hidden well of feeling in Mr. Benham senior, it had been\nvery carefully boarded over. The parental mind and attention were\nentirely engaged in a dispute in the SCHOOL WORLD about the heuristic\nmethod. Somebody had been disrespectful to Martindale House and the\nthing was rankling almost unendurably. It seemed to be a relief to him\nto show his son very fully the essentially illogical position of his\nassailant. He was entirely inattentive to Benham's carefully made\nconversational opportunities. He would be silent at times while Benham\ntalked and then he would break out suddenly with: \"What seems to me\nso unreasonable, so ridiculous, in the whole of that fellow's second\nargument--if one can call it an argument--.... A man who reasons as he\ndoes is bound to get laughed at. If people will only see it....\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE SIXTH ~~ THE NEW HAROUN AL RASCHID\n\n\n\n1\n\n\nBenham corresponded with Amanda until the summer of 1913. Sometimes\nthe two wrote coldly to one another, sometimes with warm affection,\nsometimes with great bitterness. When he met White in Johannesburg\nduring the strike period of 1913, he was on his way to see her in London\nand to settle their relationship upon a new and more definite footing.\nIt was her suggestion that they should meet.\n\nAbout her he felt an enormous, inexorable, dissatisfaction. He could not\npersuade himself that his treatment of her and that his relations to\nher squared with any of his preconceptions of nobility, and yet at no\nprecise point could he detect where he had definitely taken an ignoble\nstep. Through Amanda he was coming to the full experience of life. Like\nall of us he had been prepared, he had prepared himself, to take life\nin a certain way, and life had taken him, as it takes all of us, in an\nentirely different and unexpected way.... He had been ready for noble\ndeeds and villainies, for achievements and failures, and here as the\ndominant fact of his personal life was a perplexing riddle. He could\nnot hate and condemn her for ten minutes at a time without a flow of\nexoneration; he could not think of her tolerantly or lovingly without\nimmediate shame and resentment, and with the utmost will in the world he\ncould not banish her from his mind.\n\nDuring the intervening years he had never ceased to have her in his\nmind; he would not think of her it is true if he could help it, but\noften he could not help it, and as a negative presence, as a thing\ndenied, she was almost more potent than she had been as a thing\naccepted. Meanwhile he worked. His nervous irritability increased, but\nit did not hinder the steady development of his Research.\n\nLong before his final parting from Amanda he had worked out his idea and\nmethod for all the more personal problems in life; the problems he put\ntogether under his headings of the first three \"Limitations.\" He\nhad resolved to emancipate himself from fear, indulgence, and that\ninstinctive preoccupation with the interests and dignity of self which\nhe chose to term Jealousy, and with the one tremendous exception of\nAmanda he had to a large extent succeeded. Amanda. Amanda. Amanda.\nHe stuck the more grimly to his Research to drown that beating in his\nbrain.\n\nEmancipation from all these personal things he held now to be a mere\nprelude to the real work of a man's life, which was to serve this dream\nof a larger human purpose. The bulk of his work was to discover and\ndefine that purpose, that purpose which must be the directing and\ncomprehending form of all the activities of the noble life. One cannot\nbe noble, he had come to perceive, at large; one must be noble to\nan end. To make human life, collectively and in detail, a thing more\ncomprehensive, more beautiful, more generous and coherent than it is\nto-day seemed to him the fundamental intention of all nobility. He\nbelieved more and more firmly that the impulses to make and help and\nsubserve great purposes are abundantly present in the world, that they\nare inhibited by hasty thinking, limited thinking and bad thinking, and\nthat the real ennoblement of human life was not so much a creation as a\nrelease. He lumped the preventive and destructive forces that keep men\ndispersed, unhappy, and ignoble under the heading of Prejudice, and\nhe made this Prejudice his fourth and greatest and most difficult\nlimitation. In one place he had written it, \"Prejudice or Divisions.\"\nThat being subdued in oneself and in the world, then in the measure of\nits subjugation, the new life of our race, the great age, the noble age,\nwould begin.\n\nSo he set himself to examine his own mind and the mind of the world\nabout him for prejudice, for hampering follies, disguised disloyalties\nand mischievous distrusts, and the great bulk of the papers that White\nstruggled with at Westhaven Street were devoted to various aspects of\nthis search for \"Prejudice.\" It seemed to White to be at once the most\nmagnificent and the most preposterous of enterprises. It was indeed no\nless than an enquiry into all the preventable sources of human failure\nand disorder.... And it was all too manifest to White also that the last\nplace in which Benham was capable of detecting a prejudice was at the\nback of his own head.\n\nUnder this Fourth Limitation he put the most remarkable array\nof influences, race-hatred, national suspicion, the evil side of\npatriotism, religious and social intolerance, every social consequence\nof muddle headedness, every dividing force indeed except the\npurely personal dissensions between man and man. And he developed a\nmetaphysical interpretation of these troubles. \"No doubt,\" he wrote in\none place, \"much of the evil between different kinds of men is due to\nuncultivated feeling, to natural bad feeling, but far more is it due to\nbad thinking.\" At times he seemed on the verge of the persuasion that\nmost human trouble is really due to bad metaphysics. It was, one must\nremark, an extraordinary journey he had made; he had started from\nchivalry and arrived at metaphysics; every knight he held must be a\nlogician, and ultimate bravery is courage of the mind. One thinks of his\ncoming to this conclusion with knit brows and balancing intentness\nabove whole gulfs of bathos--very much as he had once walked the Leysin\nBisse....\n\n\"Men do not know how to think,\" he insisted--getting along the\nplanks; \"and they will not realize that they do not know how to\nthink. Nine-tenths of the wars in the world have arisen out of\nmisconceptions.... Misconception is the sin and dishonour of the mind,\nand muddled thinking as ignoble as dirty conduct.... Infinitely more\ndisastrous.\"\n\nAnd again he wrote: \"Man, I see, is an over-practical creature, too\neager to get into action. There is our deepest trouble. He takes\nconclusions ready-made, or he makes them in a hurry. Life is so short\nthat he thinks it better to err than wait. He has no patience, no faith\nin anything but himself. He thinks he is a being when in reality he is\nonly a link in a being, and so he is more anxious to be complete than\nright. The last devotion of which he is capable is that devotion of\nthe mind which suffers partial performance, but insists upon exhaustive\nthought. He scamps his thought and finishes his performance, and before\nhe is dead it is already being abandoned and begun all over again by\nsome one else in the same egotistical haste....\"\n\nIt is, I suppose, a part of the general humour of life that these words\nshould have been written by a man who walked the plank to fresh ideas\nwith the dizziest difficulty unless he had Prothero to drag him forward,\nand who acted time after time with an altogether disastrous hastiness.\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nYet there was a kind of necessity in this journey of Benham's from the\ncocked hat and wooden sword of Seagate and his early shame at cowardice\nand baseness to the spiritual megalomania of his complete Research\nMagnificent. You can no more resolve to live a life of honour nowadays\nand abstain from social and political scheming on a world-wide scale,\nthan you can profess religion and refuse to think about God. In the past\nit was possible to take all sorts of things for granted and be loyal to\nunexamined things. One could be loyal to unexamined things because they\nwere unchallenged things. But now everything is challenged. By the\ntime of his second visit to Russia, Benham's ideas of conscious\nand deliberate aristocracy reaching out to an idea of universal\nresponsibility had already grown into the extraordinary fantasy that he\nwas, as it were, an uncrowned king in the world. To be noble is to\nbe aristocratic, that is to say, a ruler. Thence it follows that\naristocracy is multiple kingship, and to be an aristocrat is to partake\nboth of the nature of philosopher and king....\n\nYet it is manifest that the powerful people of this world are by no\nmeans necessarily noble, and that most modern kings, poor in quality,\npetty in spirit, conventional in outlook, controlled and limited,\nfall far short of kingship. Nevertheless, there IS nobility, there\nIS kingship, or this earth is a dustbin and mankind but a kind of\nskin-disease upon a planet. From that it is an easy step to this idea,\nthe idea whose first expression had already so touched the imagination\nof Amanda, of a sort of diffused and voluntary kingship scattered\nthroughout mankind. The aristocrats are not at the high table, the\nkings are not enthroned, those who are enthroned are but pretenders and\nSIMULACRA, kings of the vulgar; the real king and ruler is every man who\nsets aside the naive passions and self-interest of the common life for\nthe rule and service of the world.\n\nThis is an idea that is now to be found in much contemporary writing. It\nis one of those ideas that seem to appear simultaneously at many points\nin the world, and it is impossible to say now how far Benham was\nan originator of this idea, and how far he simply resonated to its\nexpression by others. It was far more likely that Prothero, getting it\nheaven knows where, had spluttered it out and forgotten it, leaving it\nto germinate in the mind of his friend....\n\nThis lordly, this kingly dream became more and more essential to\nBenham as his life went on. When Benham walked the Bisse he was just\na youngster resolved to be individually brave; when he prowled in the\njungle by night he was there for all mankind. With every year he became\nmore and more definitely to himself a consecrated man as kings are\nconsecrated. Only that he was self-consecrated, and anointed only in\nhis heart. At last he was, so to speak, Haroun al Raschid again, going\nunsuspected about the world, because the palace of his security would\nnot tell him the secrets of men's disorders. He was no longer a creature\nof circumstances, he was kingly, unknown, Alfred in the Camp of the\nDanes. In the great later accumulations of his Research the personal\nmatter, the introspection, the intimate discussion of motive, becomes\nless and less. He forgets himself in the exaltation of kingliness. He\nworries less and less over the particular rightness of his\ndefinite acts. In these later papers White found Benham abstracted,\nself-forgetful, trying to find out with an ever increased\nself-detachment, with an ever deepening regal solicitude, why there are\nmassacres, wars, tyrannies and persecutions, why we let famine, disease\nand beasts assail us, and want dwarf and cripple vast multitudes in the\nmidst of possible plenty. And when he found out and as far as he found\nout, he meant quite simply and earnestly to apply his knowledge....\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nThe intellectualism of Benham intensified to the end. His definition of\nPrejudice impressed White as being the most bloodless and philosophical\nformula that ever dominated the mind of a man.\n\n\"Prejudice,\" Benham had written, \"is that common incapacity of the human\nmind to understand that a difference in any respect is not a difference\nin all respects, reinforced and rendered malignant by an instinctive\nhostility to what is unlike ourselves. We exaggerate classification and\nthen charge it with mischievous emotion by referring it to ourselves.\"\nAnd under this comprehensive formula he proceeded to study and attack\nFamily Prejudice, National Prejudice, Race Prejudice, War, Class\nPrejudice, Professional Prejudice, Sex Prejudice, in the most\nindustrious and elaborate manner. Whether one regards one's self or\nothers he held that these prejudices are evil things. \"From the point\nof view of human welfare they break men up into wars and conflicts,\nmake them an easy prey to those who trade upon suspicion and hostility,\nprevent sane collective co-operations, cripple and embitter life. From\nthe point of view of personal aristocracy they make men vulgar, violent,\nunjust and futile. All the conscious life of the aristocrat must be a\nconstant struggle against false generalizations; it is as much his duty\nto free himself from that as from fear, indulgence, and jealousy; it is\na larger and more elaborate task, but it is none the less cardinal and\nessential. Indeed it is more cardinal and essential. The true knight has\nto be not only no coward, no self-pamperer, no egotist. He has to be a\nphilosopher. He has to be no hasty or foolish thinker. His judgment no\nmore than his courage is to be taken by surprise.\n\n\"To subdue fear, desire and jealousy, is the aristocrat's personal\naffair, it is his ritual and discipline, like a knight watching his\narms; but the destruction of division and prejudice and all their\nforms and establishments, is his real task, that is the common work of\nknighthood. It is a task to be done in a thousand ways; one man working\nby persuasion, another by example, this one overthrowing some crippling\nrestraint upon the freedom of speech and the spread of knowledge,\nand that preparing himself for a war that will shatter a tyrannous\npresumption. Most imaginative literature, all scientific investigation,\nall sound criticism, all good building, all good manufacture, all sound\npolitics, every honesty and every reasoned kindliness contribute to this\nrelease of men from the heat and confusions of our present world.\"\n\nIt was clear to White that as Benham progressed with this major part of\nhis research, he was more and more possessed by the idea that he was not\nmaking his own personal research alone, but, side by side with a vast,\nmasked, hidden and once unsuspected multitude of others; that this great\nidea of his was under kindred forms the great idea of thousands, that\nit was breaking as the dawn breaks, simultaneously to great numbers of\npeople, and that the time was not far off when the new aristocracy, the\ndisguised rulers of the world, would begin to realize their common\nbent and effort. Into these latter papers there creeps more and more\nfrequently a new phraseology, such expressions as the \"Invisible King\"\nand the \"Spirit of Kingship,\" so that as Benham became personally more\nand more solitary, his thoughts became more and more public and social.\n\nBenham was not content to define and denounce the prejudices of mankind.\nHe set himself to study just exactly how these prejudices worked, to get\nat the nature and habits and strengths of each kind of prejudice, and to\ndevise means for its treatment, destruction or neutralization. He had no\ngreat faith in the power of pure reasonableness; his psychological ideas\nwere modern, and he had grasped the fact that the power of most of the\ngreat prejudices that strain humanity lies deeper than the intellectual\nlevel. Consequently he sought to bring himself into the closest contact\nwith prejudices in action and prejudices in conflict in order to\ndiscover their sub-rational springs.\n\nA large proportion of that larger moiety of the material at Westhaven\nStreet which White from his extensive experience of the public patience\ndecided could not possibly \"make a book,\" consisted of notes and\ndiscussions upon the first-hand observations Benham had made in this\nor that part of the world. He began in Russia during the revolutionary\ntrouble of 1906, he went thence to Odessa, and from place to place in\nBessarabia and Kieff, where during a pogrom he had his first really\nilluminating encounter with race and culture prejudice. His examination\nof the social and political condition of Russia seems to have left him\nmuch more hopeful than was the common feeling of liberal-minded people\nduring the years of depression that followed the revolution of 1906, and\nit was upon the race question that his attention concentrated.\n\nThe Swadeshi outbreak drew him from Russia to India. Here in an entirely\ndifferent environment was another discord of race and culture, and\nhe found in his study of it much that illuminated and corrected his\nimpressions of the Russian issue. A whole drawer was devoted to a\ncomparatively finished and very thorough enquiry into human dissensions\nin lower Bengal. Here there were not only race but culture conflicts,\nand he could work particularly upon the differences between men of the\nsame race who were Hindus, Christians and Mahometans respectively.\nHe could compare the Bengali Mahometan not only with the Bengali\nBrahminist, but also with the Mahometan from the north-west. \"If one\ncould scrape off all the creed and training, would one find much the\nsame thing at the bottom, or something fundamentally so different that\nno close homogeneous social life and not even perhaps a life of just\ncompromise is possible between the different races of mankind?\"\n\nHis answer to that was a confident one. \"There are no such natural and\nunalterable differences in character and quality between any two sorts\nof men whatever, as would make their peaceful and kindly co-operation in\nthe world impossible,\" he wrote.\n\nBut he was not satisfied with his observations in India. He found the\nprevalence of caste ideas antipathetic and complicating. He went on\nafter his last parting from Amanda into China, it was the first of\nseveral visits to China, and thence he crossed to America. White found a\nnumber of American press-cuttings of a vehemently anti-Japanese quality\nstill awaiting digestion in a drawer, and it was clear to him that\nBenham had given a considerable amount of attention to the development\nof the \"white\" and \"yellow\" race hostility on the Pacific slope; but his\nchief interest at that time had been the negro. He went to Washington\nand thence south; he visited Tuskegee and Atlanta, and then went off at\na tangent to Hayti. He was drawn to Hayti by Hesketh Pritchard's vivid\nbook, WHERE BLACK RULES WHITE, and like Hesketh Pritchard he was able\nto visit that wonderful monument to kingship, the hidden fastness of La\nFerriere, the citadel built a century ago by the \"Black Napoleon,\" the\nEmperor Christophe. He went with a young American demonstrator from\nHarvard.\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nIt was a memorable excursion. They rode from Cap Haytien for a day's\njourney along dusty uneven tracks through a steaming plain of luxurious\nvegetation, that presented the strangest mixture of unbridled jungle\nwith populous country. They passed countless villages of thatched huts\nalive with curiosity and swarming with naked black children, and yet all\nthe time they seemed to be in a wilderness. They forded rivers, they had\nat times to force themselves through thickets, once or twice they\nlost their way, and always ahead of them, purple and sullen, the great\nmountain peak with La Ferriere upon its crest rose slowly out of the\nbackground until it dominated the landscape. Long after dark they\nblundered upon rather than came to the village at its foot where they\nwere to pass the night. They were interrogated under a flaring torch by\npeering ragged black soldiers, and passed through a firelit crowd into\nthe presence of the local commandant to dispute volubly about their\nright to go further. They might have been in some remote corner of\nNigeria. Their papers, laboriously got in order, were vitiated by the\nfact, which only became apparent by degrees, that the commandant could\nnot read. They carried their point with difficulty.\n\nBut they carried their point, and, watched and guarded by a hungry\nhalf-naked negro in a kepi and the remains of a sky-blue pair of\ntrousers, they explored one of the most exemplary memorials of\nimperialism that humanity has ever made. The roads and parks and\nprospects constructed by this vanished Emperor of Hayti, had long\nsince disappeared, and the three men clambered for hours up ravines and\nprecipitous jungle tracks, occasionally crossing the winding traces of\na choked and ruined road that had once been the lordly approach to his\nfastness. Below they passed an abandoned palace of vast extent, a palace\nwith great terraces and the still traceable outline of gardens, though\nthere were green things pushing between the terrace steps, and trees\nthrust out of the empty windows. Here from a belvedere of which the\nskull-like vestige still remained, the negro Emperor Christophe, after\nfourteen years of absolute rule, had watched for a time the smoke of the\nburning of his cane-fields in the plain below, and then, learning that\nhis bodyguard had deserted him, had gone in and blown out his brains.\n\nHe had christened the place after the best of examples, \"Sans Souci.\"\n\nBut the citadel above, which was to have been his last defence, he never\nused. The defection of his guards made him abandon that. To build it,\nthey say, cost Hayti thirty thousand lives. He had the true Imperial\nlavishness. So high it was, so lost in a wilderness of trees and bush,\nlooking out over a land relapsed now altogether to a barbarism of patch\nand hovel, so solitary and chill under the tropical sky--for even the\nguards who still watched over its suspected treasures feared to live in\nits ghostly galleries and had made hovels outside its walls--and at the\nsame time so huge and grandiose--there were walls thirty feet thick,\ngalleries with scores of rust-eaten cannon, circular dining-halls,\nking's apartments and queen's apartments, towering battlements and\ngreat arched doorways--that it seemed to Benham to embody the power and\npassing of that miracle of human history, tyranny, the helpless bowing\nof multitudes before one man and the transitoriness of such glories,\nmore completely than anything he had ever seen or imagined in the world\nbefore. Beneath the battlements--they are choked above with jungle grass\nand tamarinds and many flowery weeds--the precipice fell away a sheer\ntwo thousand feet, and below spread a vast rich green plain populous and\ndiversified, bounded at last by the blue sea, like an amethystine wall.\nOver this precipice Christophe was wont to fling his victims, and below\nthis terrace were bottle-shaped dungeons where men, broken and torn,\nthrust in at the neck-like hole above, starved and died: it was his\nheadquarters here, here he had his torture chambers and the means for\nnameless cruelties....\n\n\"Not a hundred years ago,\" said Benham's companion, and told the story\nof the disgraced favourite, the youth who had offended.\n\n\"Leap,\" said his master, and the poor hypnotized wretch, after one\nquestioning glance at the conceivable alternatives, made his last\ngesture of servility, and then stood out against the sky, swayed, and\nwith a convulsion of resolve, leapt and shot headlong down through the\nshimmering air.\n\nCame presently the little faint sound of his fall.\n\nThe Emperor satisfied turned away, unmindful of the fact that this\nprojectile he had launched had caught among the bushes below, and\npresently struggled and found itself still a living man. It could\nscramble down to the road and, what is more wonderful, hope for mercy.\nAn hour and it stood before Christophe again, with an arm broken and\nbloody and a face torn, a battered thing now but with a faint flavour of\npride in its bearing. \"Your bidding has been done, Sire,\" it said.\n\n\"So,\" said the Emperor, unappeased. \"And you live? Well-- Leap\nagain....\"\n\nAnd then came other stories. The young man told them as he had heard\nthem, stories of ferocious wholesale butcheries, of men standing along\nthe walls of the banqueting chamber to be shot one by one as the feast\nwent on, of exquisite and terrifying cruelties, and his one note of\nwonder, his refrain was, \"HERE! Not a hundred years ago.... It makes one\nalmost believe that somewhere things of this sort are being done now.\"\n\nThey ate their lunch together amidst the weedy flowery ruins. The\nlizards which had fled their coming crept out again to bask in the\nsunshine. The soldier-guide and guard scrabbled about with his black\nfingers in the ruinous and rifled tomb of Christophe in a search for\nsome saleable memento....\n\nBenham sat musing in silence. The thought of deliberate cruelty was\nalways an actual physical distress to him. He sat bathed in the dreamy\nafternoon sunlight and struggled against the pictures that crowded\ninto his mind, pictures of men aghast at death, and of fear-driven men\ntoiling in agony, and of the shame of extorted obedience and of cringing\nand crawling black figures, and the defiance of righteous hate beaten\ndown under blow and anguish. He saw eyes alight with terror and lips\nrolled back in agony, he saw weary hopeless flight before striding proud\ndestruction, he saw the poor trampled mangled dead, and he shivered in\nhis soul....\n\nHe hated Christophe and all that made Christophe; he hated pride, and\nthen the idea came to him that it is not pride that makes Christophes\nbut humility.\n\nThere is in the medley of man's composition, deeper far than his\nsuperficial working delusion that he is a separated self-seeking\nindividual, an instinct for cooperation and obedience. Every natural\nsane man wants, though he may want it unwittingly, kingly guidance, a\ndefinite direction for his own partial life. At the bottom of his heart\nhe feels, even if he does not know it definitely, that his life is\npartial. He is driven to join himself on. He obeys decision and the\nappearance of strength as a horse obeys its rider's voice. One thinks\nof the pride, the uncontrolled frantic will of this black ape of all\nEmperors, and one forgets the universal docility that made him possible.\nUsurpation is a crime to which men are tempted by human dirigibility.\nIt is the orderly peoples who create tyrants, and it is not so much\nrestraint above as stiff insubordination below that has to be taught to\nmen. There are kings and tyrannies and imperialisms, simply because of\nthe unkingliness of men.\n\nAnd as he sat upon the battlements of La Ferriere, Benham cast off from\nhis mind his last tolerance for earthly kings and existing States, and\nexpounded to another human being for the first time this long-cherished\ndoctrine of his of the Invisible King who is the lord of human destiny,\nthe spirit of nobility, who will one day take the sceptre and rule the\nearth.... To the young American's naive American response to any simply\nfelt emotion, he seemed with his white earnestness and his glowing eyes\na veritable prophet....\n\n\"This is the root idea of aristocracy,\" said Benham.\n\n\"I have never heard the underlying spirit of democracy, the real true\nThing in democracy, so thoroughly expressed,\" said the young American.\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nBenham's notes on race and racial cultures gave White tantalizing\nglimpses of a number of picturesque experiences. The adventure in Kieff\nhad first roused Benham to the reality of racial quality. He was caught\nin the wheels of a pogrom.\n\n\"Before that time I had been disposed to minimize and deny race. I still\nthink it need not prevent men from the completest social co-operation,\nbut I see now better than I did how difficult it is for any man to purge\nfrom his mind the idea that he is not primarily a Jew, a Teuton, or a\nKelt, but a man. You can persuade any one in five minutes that he or she\nbelongs to some special and blessed and privileged sort of human\nbeing; it takes a lifetime to destroy that persuasion. There are these\nconfounded differences of colour, of eye and brow, of nose or hair,\nsmall differences in themselves except that they give a foothold and\nfoundation for tremendous fortifications of prejudice and tradition, in\nwhich hostilities and hatreds may gather. When I think of a Jew's nose,\na Chinaman's eyes or a negro's colour I am reminded of that fatal little\npit which nature has left in the vermiform appendix, a thing no use in\nitself and of no significance, but a gathering-place for mischief. The\nextremest case of race-feeling is the Jewish case, and even here, I am\nconvinced, it is the Bible and the Talmud and the exertions of those\ninevitable professional champions who live upon racial feeling, far more\nthan their common distinction of blood, which holds this people together\nbanded against mankind.\"\n\nBetween the lines of such general propositions as this White read little\nscraps of intimation that linked with the things Benham let fall in\nJohannesburg to reconstruct the Kieff adventure.\n\nBenham had been visiting a friend in the country on the further side\nof the Dnieper. As they drove back along dusty stretches of road amidst\nfields of corn and sunflower and through bright little villages, they\nsaw against the evening blue under the full moon a smoky red glare\nrising from amidst the white houses and dark trees of the town. \"The\npogrom's begun,\" said Benham's friend, and was surprised when Benham\nwanted to end a pleasant day by going to see what happens after the\nbeginning of a pogrom.\n\nHe was to have several surprises before at last he left Benham in\ndisgust and went home by himself.\n\nFor Benham, with that hastiness that so flouted his exalted theories,\npassed rapidly from an attitude of impartial enquiry to active\nintervention. The two men left their carriage and plunged into\nthe network of unlovely dark streets in which the Jews and traders\nharboured.... Benham's first intervention was on behalf of a crouching\nand yelping bundle of humanity that was being dragged about and kicked\nat a street corner. The bundle resolved itself into a filthy little old\nman, and made off with extraordinary rapidity, while Benham remonstrated\nwith the kickers. Benham's tallness, his very Gentile face, his good\nclothes, and an air of tense authority about him had its effect, and\nthe kickers shuffled off with remarks that were partly apologies. But\nBenham's friend revolted. This was no business of theirs.\n\nBenham went on unaccompanied towards the glare of the burning houses.\n\nFor a time he watched. Black figures moved between him and the glare,\nand he tried to find out the exact nature of the conflict by enquiries\nin clumsy Russian. He was told that the Jews had insulted a religious\nprocession, that a Jew had spat at an ikon, that the shop of a cheating\nJew trader had been set on fire, and that the blaze had spread to the\nadjacent group of houses. He gathered that the Jews were running out of\nthe burning block on the other side \"like rats.\" The crowd was mostly\ncomposed of town roughs with a sprinkling of peasants. They were\nmischievous but undecided. Among them were a number of soldiers, and\nhe was surprised to see a policemen, brightly lit from head to foot,\nwatching the looting of a shop that was still untouched by the flames.\n\nHe held back some men who had discovered a couple of women's figures\nslinking along in the shadow beneath a wall. Behind his remonstrances\nthe Jewesses escaped. His anger against disorder was growing upon\nhim....\n\nLate that night Benham found himself the leading figure amidst a party\nof Jews who had made a counter attack upon a gang of roughs in a court\nthat had become the refuge of a crowd of fugitives. Some of the young\nJewish men had already been making a fight, rather a poor and hopeless\nfight, from the windows of the house near the entrance of the court, but\nit is doubtful if they would have made an effective resistance if it\nhad not been for this tall excited stranger who was suddenly shouting\ndirections to them in sympathetically murdered Russian. It was not that\nhe brought powerful blows or subtle strategy to their assistance, but\nthat he put heart into them and perplexity into his adversaries because\nhe was so manifestly non-partizan. Nobody could ever have mistaken\nBenham for a Jew. When at last towards dawn a not too zealous governor\ncalled out the troops and began to clear the streets of rioters, Benham\nand a band of Jews were still keeping the gateway of that court behind a\nhasty but adequate barricade of furniture and handbarrows.\n\nThe ghetto could not understand him, nobody could understand him, but it\nwas clear a rare and precious visitor had come to their rescue, and he\nwas implored by a number of elderly, dirty, but very intelligent-looking\nold men to stay with them and preserve them until their safety was\nassured.\n\nThey could not understand him, but they did their utmost to entertain\nhim and assure him of their gratitude. They seemed to consider him as\na representative of the British Government, and foreign intervention on\ntheir behalf is one of those unfortunate fixed ideas that no persecuted\nJews seem able to abandon.\n\nBenham found himself, refreshed and tended, sitting beside a wood fire\nin an inner chamber richly flavoured by humanity and listening to a\ndiscourse in evil but understandable German. It was a discourse upon the\nwrongs and the greatness of the Jewish people--and it was delivered by\na compact middle-aged man with a big black beard and long-lashed but\nanimated eyes. Beside him a very old man dozed and nodded approval. A\nnumber of other men crowded the apartment, including several who had\nhelped to hold off the rioters from the court. Some could follow the\ntalk and ever again endorsed the speaker in Yiddish or Russian; others\nlistened with tantalized expressions, their brows knit, their lips\nmoving.\n\nIt was a discourse Benham had provoked. For now he was at the very heart\nof the Jewish question, and he could get some light upon the mystery\nof this great hatred at first hand. He did not want to hear tales of\noutrages, of such things he knew, but he wanted to understand what was\nthe irritation that caused these things.\n\nSo he listened. The Jew dilated at first on the harmlessness and\nusefulness of the Jews.\n\n\"But do you never take a certain advantage?\" Benham threw out.\n\n\"The Jews are cleverer than the Russians. Must we suffer for that?\"\n\nThe spokesman went on to the more positive virtues of his race. Benham\nsuddenly had that uncomfortable feeling of the Gentile who finds a bill\nbeing made against him. Did the world owe Israel nothing for Philo,\nAron ben Asher, Solomon Gabriol, Halevy, Mendelssohn, Heine, Meyerbeer,\nRubinstein, Joachim, Zangwill? Does Britain owe nothing to Lord\nBeaconsfield, Montefiore or the Rothschilds? Can France repudiate her\ndebt to Fould, Gaudahaux, Oppert, or Germany to Furst, Steinschneider,\nHerxheimer, Lasker, Auerbach, Traube and Lazarus and Benfey?...\n\nBenham admitted under the pressure of urgent tones and gestures that\nthese names did undoubtedly include the cream of humanity, but was it\nnot true that the Jews did press a little financially upon the inferior\npeoples whose lands they honoured in their exile?\n\nThe man with the black beard took up the challenge bravely.\n\n\"They are merciful creditors,\" he said. \"And it is their genius to\npossess and control. What better stewards could you find for the wealth\nof nations than the Jews? And for the honours? That always had been the\nrole of the Jews--stewardship. Since the days of Joseph in Egypt....\"\n\nThen in a lower voice he went on to speak of the deficiencies of the\nGentile population. He wished to be just and generous but the truth was\nthe truth. The Christian Russians loved drink and laziness; they had no\nsense of property; were it not for unjust laws even now the Jews would\npossess all the land of South Russia....\n\nBenham listened with a kind of fascination. \"But,\" he said.\n\nIt was so. And with a confidence that aroused a protest or so from the\nonlookers, the Jewish apologist suddenly rose up, opened a safe close\nbeside the fire and produced an armful of documents.\n\n\"Look!\" he said, \"all over South Russia there are these!\"\n\nBenham was a little slow to understand, until half a dozen of these\npapers had been thrust into his hand. Eager fingers pointed, and several\nvoices spoke. These things were illegalities that might some day be\nlegal; there were the records of loans and hidden transactions that\nmight at any time put all the surrounding soil into the hands of the\nJew. All South Russia was mortgaged....\n\n\"But is it so?\" asked Benham, and for a time ceased to listen and stared\ninto the fire.\n\nThen he held up the papers in his hand to secure silence and, feeling\nhis way in unaccustomed German, began to speak and continued to speak in\nspite of a constant insurgent undertone of interruption from the Jewish\nspokesman.\n\nAll men, Benham said, were brothers. Did they not remember Nathan the\nWise?\n\n\"I did not claim him,\" said the spokesman, misunderstanding. \"He is a\ncharacter in fiction.\"\n\nBut all men are brothers, Benham maintained. They had to be merciful to\none another and give their gifts freely to one another. Also they had\nto consider each other's weaknesses. The Jews were probably justified\nin securing and administering the property of every community into which\nthey came, they were no doubt right in claiming to be best fitted for\nthat task, but also they had to consider, perhaps more than they did,\nthe feelings and vanities of the host population into which they brought\nthese beneficent activities. What was said of the ignorance, incapacity\nand vice of the Roumanians and Russians was very generally believed and\naccepted, but it did not alter the fact that the peasant, for all his\nincapacity, did like to imagine he owned his own patch and hovel and did\nhave a curious irrational hatred of debt....\n\nThe faces about Benham looked perplexed.\n\n\"THIS,\" said Benham, tapping the papers in his hand. \"They will not\nunderstand the ultimate benefit of it. It will be a source of anger\nand fresh hostility. It does not follow because your race has supreme\nfinancial genius that you must always follow its dictates to the\nexclusion of other considerations....\"\n\nThe perplexity increased.\n\nBenham felt he must be more general. He went on to emphasize the\nbrotherhood of man, the right to equal opportunity, equal privilege,\nfreedom to develop their idiosyncrasies as far as possible, unhindered\nby the idiosyncrasies of others. He could feel the sympathy and\nunderstanding of his hearers returning. \"You see,\" said Benham, \"you\nmust have generosity. You must forget ancient scores. Do you not see the\nworld must make a fresh beginning?\"\n\nHe was entirely convinced he had them with him. The heads nodded assent,\nthe bright eyes and lips followed the slow disentanglement of his bad\nGerman.\n\n\"Free yourselves and the world,\" he said.\n\nApplause.\n\n\"And so,\" he said breaking unconsciously into English, \"let us begin by\nburning these BEASTLY mortgages!\"\n\nAnd with a noble and dramatic gesture Benham cast his handful on the\nfire. The assenting faces became masks of horror. A score of hands\nclutched at those precious papers, and a yell of dismay and anger filled\nthe room. Some one caught at his throat from behind. \"Don't kill him!\"\ncried some one. \"He fought for us!\"\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nAn hour later Benham returned in an extraordinarily dishevelled\nand battered condition to his hotel. He found his friend in anxious\nconsultation with the hotel proprietor.\n\n\"We were afraid that something had happened to you,\" said his friend.\n\n\"I got a little involved,\" said Benham.\n\n\"Hasn't some one clawed your cheek?\"\n\n\"Very probably,\" said Benham.\n\n\"And torn your coat? And hit you rather heavily upon the neck?\"\n\n\"It was a complicated misunderstanding,\" said Benham. \"Oh! pardon! I'm\nrather badly bruised upon that arm you're holding.\"\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nBenham told the story to White as a jest against himself.\n\n\"I see now of course that they could not possibly understand my point of\nview,\" he said....\n\n\"I'm not sure if they quite followed my German....\n\n\"It's odd, too, that I remember saying, 'Let's burn these mortgages,'\nand at the time I'm almost sure I didn't know the German for\nmortgage....\"\n\nIt was not the only occasion on which other people had failed to\ngrasp the full intention behind Benham's proceedings. His aristocratic\nimpulses were apt to run away with his conceptions of brotherhood, and\ntime after time it was only too manifest to White that Benham's\npallid flash of anger had astonished the subjects of his disinterested\nobservations extremely. His explorations in Hayti had been terminated\nabruptly by an affair with a native policeman that had necessitated the\nintervention of the British Consul. It was begun with that suddenness\nthat was too often characteristic of Benham, by his hitting the\npoliceman. It was in the main street of Cap Haytien, and the policeman\nhad just clubbed an unfortunate youth over the head with the heavily\nloaded wooden club which is the normal instrument of Haytien discipline.\nHis blow was a repartee, part of a triangular altercation in which a\nlarge, voluble, mahogany-coloured lady whose head was tied up in a\nblue handkerchief played a conspicuous part, but it seemed to Benham an\nentirely unjustifiable blow.\n\nHe allowed an indignation with negro policemen in general that had been\ngathering from the very moment of his arrival at Port-au-Prince to carry\nhim away. He advanced with the kind of shout one would hurl at a dog,\nand smote the policeman to the earth with the stout stick that the\npeculiar social atmosphere of Hayti had disposed him to carry. By the\nlocal standard his blow was probably a trivial one, but the moral effect\nof his indignant pallor and a sort of rearing tallness about him\non these occasions was always very considerable. Unhappily these\ncharacteristics could have no effect on a second negro policeman who was\napproaching the affray from behind, and he felled Benham by a blow on\nthe shoulder that was meant for the head, and with the assistance of his\ncolleague overpowered him, while the youth and the woman vanished.\n\nThe two officials dragged Benham in a state of vehement protest to the\nlock-up, and only there, in the light of a superior officer's superior\nknowledge, did they begin to realize the grave fact of his British\ncitizenship.\n\nThe memory of the destruction of the Haytien fleet by a German gunboat\nwas still vivid in Port-au-Prince, and to that Benham owed it that in\nspite of his blank refusal to compensate the man he had knocked over, he\nwas after two days of anger, two days of extreme insanitary experience,\nand much meditation upon his unphilosophical hastiness, released.\n\nQuite a number of trivial incidents of a kindred sort diversified his\nenquiries into Indian conditions. They too turned for the most part\non his facile exasperation at any defiance of his deep-felt desire for\nhuman brotherhood. At last indeed came an affair that refused ultimately\nto remain trivial, and tangled him up in a coil that invoked newspaper\narticles and heated controversies.\n\nThe effect of India upon Benham's mind was a peculiar mixture of\nattraction and irritation. He was attracted by the Hindu spirit of\nintellectualism and the Hindu repudiation of brutality, and he was\ninfuriated by the spirit of caste that cuts the great world of India\ninto a thousand futile little worlds, all aloof and hostile one to the\nother. \"I came to see India,\" he wrote, \"and there is no India. There is\na great number of Indias, and each goes about with its chin in the air,\nquietly scorning everybody else.\"\n\nHis Indian adventures and his great public controversy on caste began\nwith a tremendous row with an Indian civil servant who had turned an\nIndian gentleman out of his first-class compartment, and culminated in\na disgraceful fracas with a squatting brown holiness at Benares, who had\nthrown aside his little brass bowlful of dinner because Benham's shadow\nhad fallen upon it.\n\n\"You unendurable snob!\" said Benham, and then lapsing into the forceful\nand inadvisable: \"By Heaven, you SHALL eat it!...\"\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nBenham's detestation of human divisions and hostilities was so deep in\nhis character as to seem almost instinctive. But he had too a very clear\nreason for his hostility to all these amazing breaks in human continuity\nin his sense of the gathering dangers they now involve. They had always,\nhe was convinced, meant conflict, hatred, misery and the destruction\nof human dignity, but the new conditions of life that have been brought\nabout by modern science were making them far more dangerous than they\nhad ever been before. He believed that the evil and horror of war was\nbecoming more and more tremendous with every decade, and that the free\nplay of national prejudice and that stupid filching ambitiousness\nthat seems to be inseparable from monarchy, were bound to precipitate\ncatastrophe, unless a real international aristocracy could be brought\ninto being to prevent it.\n\nIn the drawer full of papers labelled \"Politics,\" White found a paper\ncalled \"The Metal Beast.\" It showed that for a time Benham had been\ngreatly obsessed by the thought of the armaments that were in those days\npiling up in every country in Europe. He had gone to Essen, and at Essen\nhe had met a German who had boasted of Zeppelins and the great guns that\nwere presently to smash the effete British fleet and open the Imperial\nway to London.\n\n\"I could not sleep,\" he wrote, \"on account of this man and his talk and\nthe streak of hatred in his talk. He distressed me not because he seemed\nexceptional, but because he seemed ordinary. I realized that he was more\nhuman than I was, and that only killing and killing could come out of\nsuch humanity. I thought of the great ugly guns I had seen, and of the\nstill greater guns he had talked about, and how gloatingly he thought\nof the destruction they could do. I felt as I used to feel about that\ninfernal stallion that had killed a man with its teeth and feet, a\ndespairing fear, a sense of monstrosity in life. And this creature\nwho had so disturbed me was only a beastly snuffy little man in an\nill-fitting frock-coat, who laid his knife and fork by their tips on the\nedge of his plate, and picked his teeth with gusto and breathed into\nmy face as he talked to me. The commonest of representative men. I went\nabout that Westphalian country after that, with the conviction that\nheadless, soulless, blood-drinking metal monsters were breeding all\nabout me. I felt that science was producing a poisonous swarm, a nest\nof black dragons. They were crouching here and away there in France and\nEngland, they were crouching like beasts that bide their time, mewed\nup in forts, kennelled in arsenals, hooded in tarpaulins as hawks are\nhooded.... And I had never thought very much about them before, and\nthere they were, waiting until some human fool like that frock-coated\nthing of spite, and fools like him multiplied by a million, saw fit\nto call them out to action. Just out of hatred and nationalism and\nfaction....\"\n\nThen came a queer fancy.\n\n\"Great guns, mines, battleships, all that cruelty-apparatus; I see it\nmore and more as the gathering revenge of dead joyless matter for the\nhappiness of life. It is a conspiracy of the lifeless, an enormous\nplot of the rebel metals against sensation. That is why in particular\nhalf-living people seem to love these things. La Ferriere was a fastness\nof the kind of tyranny that passes out of human experience, the tyranny\nof the strong man over men. Essen comes, the new thing, the tyranny of\nthe strong machine....\n\n\"Science is either slave or master. These people--I mean the German\npeople and militarist people generally--have no real mastery over the\nscientific and economic forces on which they seem to ride. The monster\nof steel and iron carries Kaiser and Germany and all Europe captive. It\nhas persuaded them to mount upon its back and now they must follow the\nlogic of its path. Whither?... Only kingship will ever master that beast\nof steel which has got loose into the world. Nothing but the sense of\nunconquerable kingship in us all will ever dare withstand it.... Men\nmust be kingly aristocrats--it isn't MAY be now, it is MUST be--or,\nthese confederated metals, these things of chemistry and metallurgy,\nthese explosives and mechanisms, will trample the blood and life out of\nour race into mere red-streaked froth and filth....\"\n\nThen he turned to the question of this metallic beast's release. Would\nit ever be given blood?\n\n\"Men of my generation have been brought up in this threat of a great war\nthat never comes; for forty years we have had it, so that it is with\na note of incredulity that one tells oneself, 'After all this war may\nhappen. But can it happen?'\"\n\nHe proceeded to speculate upon the probability whether a great war would\never devastate western Europe again, and it was very evident to White\nthat he wanted very much to persuade himself against that idea. It was\ntoo disagreeable for him to think it probable. The paper was dated 1910.\nIt was in October, 1914, that White, who was still working upon the\nlaborious uncertain account of Benham's life and thought he has recently\npublished, read what Benham had written. Benham concluded that the\ncommon-sense of the world would hold up this danger until reason could\nget \"to the head of things.\"\n\n\"There are already mighty forces in Germany,\" Benham wrote, \"that will\nstruggle very powerfully to avoid a war. And these forces increase.\nBehind the coarseness and the threatenings, the melodrama and the\ndisplay of the vulgarer sort there arises a great and noble people.... I\nhave talked with Germans of the better kind.... You cannot have a whole\nnation of Christophes.... There also the true knighthood discovers\nitself.... I do not believe this war will overtake us.\"\n\n\"WELL!\" said White.\n\n\"I must go back to Germany and understand Germany better,\" the notes\nwent on.\n\nBut other things were to hold Benham back from that resolve. Other\nthings were to hold many men back from similar resolves until it was too\nlate for them....\n\n\"It is preposterous that these monstrous dangers should lower over\nEurope, because a certain threatening vanity has crept into the blood of\na people, because a few crude ideas go inadequately controlled.... Does\nno one see what that metallic beast will do if they once let it loose?\nIt will trample cities; it will devour nations....\"\n\nWhite read this on the 9th of October, 1914. One crumpled evening\npaper at his feet proclaimed in startled headlines: \"Rain of Incendiary\nShells. Antwerp Ablaze.\" Another declared untruthfully but impressively:\n\"Six Zeppelins drop Bombs over the Doomed City.\"\n\nHe had bought all the evening papers, and had read and re-read them and\nturned up maps and worried over strategic problems for which he had no\ndata at all--as every one did at that time--before he was able to go on\nwith Benham's manuscripts.\n\nThese pacific reassurances seemed to White's war-troubled mind like\nfinding a flattened and faded flower, a girl's love token, between the\npages of some torn and scorched and blood-stained book picked out from a\nheap of loot after rapine and murder had had their fill....\n\n\"How can we ever begin over again?\" said White, and sat for a long time\nstaring gloomily into the fire, forgetting forgetting, forgetting too\nthat men who are tired and weary die, and that new men are born to\nsucceed them....\n\n\"We have to begin over again,\" said White at last, and took up Benham's\npapers where he had laid them down....\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nOne considerable section of Benham's treatment of the Fourth Limitation\nwas devoted to what he called the Prejudices of Social Position. This\nsection alone was manifestly expanding into a large treatise upon the\npsychology of economic organization....\n\nIt was only very slowly that he had come to realize the important part\nplayed by economic and class hostilities in the disordering of\nhuman affairs. This was a very natural result of his peculiar social\ncircumstances. Most people born to wealth and ease take the established\nindustrial system as the natural method in human affairs; it is only\nvery reluctantly and by real feats of sympathy and disinterestedness\nthat they can be brought to realize that it is natural only in the sense\nthat it has grown up and come about, and necessary only because nobody\nis strong and clever enough to rearrange it. Their experience of it is\na satisfactory experience. On the other hand, the better off one is, the\nwider is one's outlook and the more alert one is to see the risks and\ndangers of international dissensions. Travel and talk to foreigners open\none's eyes to aggressive possibilities; history and its warnings become\nconceivable. It is in the nature of things that socialists and labour\nparties should minimize international obligations and necessities, and\nequally so that autocracies and aristocracies and plutocracies should be\nnegligent of and impatient about social reform.\n\nBut Benham did come to realize this broader conflict between worker and\ndirector, between poor man and possessor, between resentful humanity and\nenterprise, between unwilling toil and unearned opportunity. It is a far\nprofounder and subtler conflict than any other in human affairs. \"I can\nforesee a time,\" he wrote, \"when the greater national and racial hatreds\nmay all be so weakened as to be no longer a considerable source of human\nlimitation and misery, when the suspicions of complexion and language\nand social habit are allayed, and when the element of hatred and\naggression may be clean washed out of most religious cults, but I do not\nbegin to imagine a time, because I cannot imagine a method, when there\nwill not be great friction between those who employ, those who direct\ncollective action, and those whose part it is to be the rank and file in\nindustrialism. This, I know, is a limitation upon my confidence due\nvery largely to the restricted nature of my knowledge of this sort of\norganization. Very probably resentment and suspicion in the mass and\nself-seeking and dishonesty in the fortunate few are not so deeply\nseated, so necessary as they seem to be, and if men can be cheerfully\nobedient and modestly directive in war time, there is no reason why\nultimately they should not be so in the business of peace. But I do not\nunderstand the elements of the methods by which this state of affairs\ncan be brought about.\n\n\"If I were to confess this much to an intelligent working man I know\nthat at once he would answer 'Socialism,' but Socialism is no more a\nsolution of this problem than eating is a solution when one is lost in\nthe wilderness and hungry. Of course everybody with any intelligence\nwants Socialism, everybody, that is to say, wants to see all human\nefforts directed to the common good and a common end, but brought face\nto face with practical problems Socialism betrays a vast insufficiency\nof practical suggestions. I do not say that Socialism would not work,\nbut I do say that so far Socialists have failed to convince me that\nthey could work it. The substitution of a stupid official for a greedy\nproprietor may mean a vanished dividend, a limited output and no\nother human advantage whatever. Socialism is in itself a mere eloquent\ngesture, inspiring, encouraging, perhaps, but beyond that not very\nhelpful, towards the vast problem of moral and material adjustment\nbefore the race. That problem is incurably miscellaneous and intricate,\nand only by great multitudes of generous workers, one working at this\npoint and one at that, secretly devoted knights of humanity, hidden\nand dispersed kings, unaware of one another, doubting each his right\nto count himself among those who do these kingly services, is this\nelaborate rightening of work and guidance to be done.\"\n\nSo from these most fundamental social difficulties he came back to his\npanacea. All paths and all enquiries led him back to his conception of\naristocracy, conscious, self-disciplined, devoted, self-examining yet\nsecret, making no personal nor class pretences, as the supreme need not\nonly of the individual but the world.\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nIt was the Labour trouble in the Transvaal which had brought the two\nschoolfellows together again. White had been on his way to Zimbabwe.\nAn emotional disturbance of unusual intensity had driven him to seek\nconsolations in strange scenery and mysterious desolations. It was as if\nZimbabwe called to him. Benham had come to South Africa to see into the\nquestion of Indian immigration, and he was now on his way to meet Amanda\nin London. Neither man had given much heed to the gathering social\nconflict on the Rand until the storm burst about them. There had been\na few paragraphs in the papers about a dispute upon a point of labour\netiquette, a question of the recognition of Trade Union officials, a\nthing that impressed them both as technical, and then suddenly a long\nincubated quarrel flared out in rioting and violence, the burning of\nhouses and furniture, attacks on mines, attempts to dynamite trains.\nWhite stayed in Johannesburg because he did not want to be stranded up\ncountry by the railway strike that was among the possibilities of\nthe situation. Benham stayed because he was going to London very\nreluctantly, and he was glad of this justification for a few days'\ndelay. The two men found themselves occupying adjacent tables in the\nSherborough Hotel, and White was the first to recognize the other. They\ncame together with a warmth and readiness of intimacy that neither would\nhave displayed in London.\n\nWhite had not seen Benham since the social days of Amanda at Lancaster\nGate, and he was astonished at the change a few years had made in him.\nThe peculiar contrast of his pallor and his dark hair had become more\nmarked, his skin was deader, his features seemed more prominent and his\nexpression intenser. His eyes were very bright and more sunken under his\nbrows. He had suffered from yellow fever in the West Indies, and these\nit seemed were the marks left by that illness. And he was much more\ndetached from the people about him; less attentive to the small\nincidents of life, more occupied with inner things. He greeted White\nwith a confidence that White was one day to remember as pathetic.\n\n\"It is good to meet an old friend,\" Benham said. \"I have lost friends.\nAnd I do not make fresh ones. I go about too much by myself, and I do\nnot follow the same tracks that other people are following....\"\n\nWhat track was he following? It was now that White first heard of the\nResearch Magnificent. He wanted to know what Benham was doing, and\nBenham after some partial and unsatisfactory explanation of his interest\nin insurgent Hindoos, embarked upon larger expositions. \"It is, of\ncourse, a part of something else,\" he amplified. He was writing a book,\n\"an enormous sort of book.\" He laughed with a touch of shyness. It\nwas about \"everything,\" about how to live and how not to live. And\n\"aristocracy, and all sorts of things.\" White was always curious about\nother people's books. Benham became earnest and more explicit under\nencouragement, and to talk about his book was soon to talk about\nhimself. In various ways, intentionally and inadvertently, he told White\nmuch. These chance encounters, these intimacies of the train and hotel,\nwill lead men at times to a stark frankness of statement they would\nnever permit themselves with habitual friends.\n\nAbout the Johannesburg labour trouble they talked very little,\nconsidering how insistent it was becoming. But the wide propositions\nof the Research Magnificent, with its large indifference to immediate\noccurrences, its vast patience, its tremendous expectations, contrasted\nvery sharply in White's memory with the bitterness, narrowness and\nresentment of the events about them. For him the thought of that first\ndiscussion of this vast inchoate book into which Benham's life was\nflowering, and which he was ultimately to summarize, trailed with it a\nfringe of vivid little pictures; pictures of crowds of men hurrying\non bicycles and afoot under a lowering twilight sky towards murmuring\ncentres of disorder, of startling flares seen suddenly afar off, of the\nmuffled galloping of troops through the broad dusty street in the night,\nof groups of men standing and watching down straight broad roads, roads\nthat ended in groups of chimneys and squat buildings of corrugated iron.\nAnd once there was a marching body of white men in the foreground and a\ncomplicated wire fence, and a clustering mass of Kaffirs watching them\nover this fence and talking eagerly amongst themselves.\n\n\"All this affair here is little more than a hitch in the machinery,\"\nsaid Benham, and went back to his large preoccupation....\n\nBut White, who had not seen so much human disorder as Benham, felt that\nit was more than that. Always he kept the tail of his eye upon that\neventful background while Benham talked to him.\n\nWhen the firearms went off he may for the moment have even given the\nbackground the greater share of his attention....\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nIt was only as White burrowed through his legacy of documents that the\nfull values came to very many things that Benham said during these last\nconversations. The papers fitted in with his memories of their long\ntalks like text with commentary; so much of Benham's talk had repeated\nthe private writings in which he had first digested his ideas that it\nwas presently almost impossible to disentangle what had been said and\nunderstood at Johannesburg from the fuller statement of those patched\nand corrected manuscripts. The two things merged in White's mind as he\nread. The written text took upon itself a resonance of Benham's\nvoice; it eked out the hints and broken sentences of his remembered\nconversation.\n\nBut some things that Benham did not talk about at all, left by their\nmere marked absence an impression on White's mind. And occasionally\nafter Benham had been talking for a long time there would be an\noccasional aphasia, such as is often apparent in the speech of men who\nrestrain themselves from betraying a preoccupation. He would say nothing\nabout Amanda or about women in general, he was reluctant to speak of\nProthero, and another peculiarity was that he referred perhaps half a\ndozen times or more to the idea that he was a \"prig.\" He seemed to be\ndefending himself against some inner accusation, some unconquerable\ndoubt of the entire adventure of his life. These half hints and hints by\nomission exercised the quick intuitions of White's mind very keenly, and\nhe drew far closer to an understanding of Benham's reserves than Benham\never suspected....\n\nAt first after his parting from Amanda in London Benham had felt\ncompletely justified in his treatment of her. She had betrayed him and\nhe had behaved, he felt, with dignity and self-control. He had no doubt\nthat he had punished her very effectively, and it was only after he had\nbeen travelling in China with Prothero for some time and in the light\nof one or two chance phrases in her letters that he began to have doubts\nwhether he ought to have punished her at all. And one night at Shanghai\nhe had a dream in which she stood before him, dishevelled and tearful,\nhis Amanda, very intensely his Amanda, and said that she was dirty\nand shameful and spoilt for ever, because he had gone away from her.\nAfterwards the dream became absurd: she showed him the black leopard's\nfur as though it was a rug, and it was now moth-eaten and mangey, the\nleopard skin that had been so bright and wonderful such a little time\nago, and he awoke before he could answer her, and for a long time he\nwas full of unspoken answers explaining that in view of her deliberate\nunfaithfulness the position she took up was absurd. She had spoilt her\nown fur. But what was more penetrating and distressing in this dream was\nnot so much the case Amanda stated as the atmosphere of unconquerable\nintimacy between them, as though they still belonged to each other,\nsoul to soul, as though nothing that had happened afterwards could have\ndestroyed their common responsibility and the common interest of their\nfirst unstinted union. She was hurt, and of course he was hurt. He began\nto see that his marriage to Amanda was still infinitely more than a\ntechnical bond.\n\nAnd having perceived that much he presently began to doubt whether she\nrealized anything of the sort. Her letters fluctuated very much in tone,\nbut at times they were as detached and guarded as a schoolgirl writing\nto a cousin. Then it seemed to Benham an extraordinary fraud on her\npart that she should presume to come into his dream with an entirely\ndeceptive closeness and confidence. She began to sound him in these\nlatter letters upon the possibility of divorce. This, which he had been\nquite disposed to concede in London, now struck him as an outrageous\nsuggestion. He wrote to ask her why, and she responded exasperatingly\nthat she thought it was \"better.\" But, again, why better? It is\nremarkable that although his mind had habituated itself to the idea that\nEaston was her lover in London, her thought of being divorced, no doubt\nto marry again, filled him with jealous rage. She asked him to take\nthe blame in the divorce proceedings. There, again, he found himself\nungenerous. He did not want to do that. Why should he do that? As a\nmatter of fact he was by no means reconciled to the price he had paid\nfor his Research Magnificent; he regretted his Amanda acutely. He was\nregretting her with a regret that grew when by all the rules of life it\nought to be diminishing.\n\nIt was in consequence of that regret and his controversies with Prothero\nwhile they travelled together in China that his concern about what he\ncalled priggishness arose. It is a concern that one may suppose has a\nlittle afflicted every reasonably self-conscious man who has turned from\nthe natural passionate personal life to religion or to public service\nor any abstract devotion. These things that are at least more extensive\nthan the interests of flesh and blood have a trick of becoming\nunsubstantial, they shine gloriously and inspiringly upon the\nimagination, they capture one and isolate one and then they vanish out\nof sight. It is far easier to be entirely faithful to friend or lover\nthan it is to be faithful to a cause or to one's country or to a\nreligion. In the glow of one's first service that larger idea may be as\nclosely spontaneous as a handclasp, but in the darkness that comes as\nthe glow dies away there is a fearful sense of unreality. It was in such\ndark moments that Benham was most persecuted by his memories of Amanda\nand most distressed by this suspicion that the Research Magnificent was\na priggishness, a pretentious logomachy. Prothero could indeed hint as\nmuch so skilfully that at times the dream of nobility seemed an insult\nto the sunshine, to the careless laughter of children, to the good light\nin wine and all the warm happiness of existence. And then Amanda would\npeep out of the dusk and whisper, \"Of course if you could leave me--!\nWas I not LIFE? Even now if you cared to come back to me-- For I loved\nyou best and loved you still, old Cheetah, long after you had left me to\nfollow your dreams.... Even now I am drifting further into lies and the\nlast shreds of dignity drop from me; a dirty, lost, and shameful\nleopard I am now, who was once clean and bright.... You could come back,\nCheetah, and you could save me yet. If you would love me....\"\n\nIn certain moods she could wring his heart by such imagined speeches,\nthe very quality of her voice was in them, a softness that his ear had\nloved, and not only could she distress him, but when Benham was in this\nheartache mood, when once she had set him going, then his little mother\nalso would rise against him, touchingly indignant, with her blue eyes\nbright with tears; and his frowsty father would back towards him and\nsit down complaining that he was neglected, and even little Mrs.\nSkelmersdale would reappear, bravely tearful on her chair looking after\nhim as he slunk away from her through Kensington Gardens; indeed every\npersonal link he had ever had to life could in certain moods pull him\nback through the door of self-reproach Amanda opened and set him aching\nand accusing himself of harshness and self-concentration. The very\nkittens of his childhood revived forgotten moments of long-repented\nhardness. For a year before Prothero was killed there were these\nheartaches. That tragedy gave them their crowning justification. All\nthese people said in this form or that, \"You owed a debt to us, you\nevaded it, you betrayed us, you owed us life out of yourself, love and\nservices, and you have gone off from us all with this life that was\nours, to live by yourself in dreams about the rule of the world,\nand with empty phantoms of power and destiny. All this was\nintellectualization. You sacrificed us to the thin things of the mind.\nThere is no rule of the world at all, or none that a man like you\nmay lay hold upon. The rule of the world is a fortuitous result of\nincalculably multitudinous forces. But all of us you could have made\nhappier. You could have spared us distresses. Prothero died because of\nyou. Presently it will be the turn of your father, your mother--Amanda\nperhaps....\"\n\nHe made no written note of his heartaches, but he made several memoranda\nabout priggishness that White read and came near to understanding. In\nspite of the tugging at his heart-strings, Benham was making up his mind\nto be a prig. He weighed the cold uningratiating virtues of priggishness\nagainst his smouldering passion for Amanda, and against his obstinate\nsympathy for Prothero's grossness and his mother's personal pride, and\nhe made his choice. But it was a reluctant choice.\n\nOne fragment began in the air. \"Of course I had made myself responsible\nfor her life. But it was, you see, such a confoundedly energetic life,\nas vigorous and as slippery as an eel.... Only by giving all my strength\nto her could I have held Amanda.... So what was the good of trying to\nhold Amanda?...\n\n\"All one's people have this sort of claim upon one. Claims made by their\npride and their self-respect, and their weaknesses and dependences.\nYou've no right to hurt them, to kick about and demand freedom when\nit means snapping and tearing the silly suffering tendrils they have\nwrapped about you. The true aristocrat I think will have enough grasp,\nenough steadiness, to be kind and right to every human being and still\ndo the work that ought to be his essential life. I see that now.\nIt's one of the things this last year or so of loneliness has made me\nrealize; that in so far as I have set out to live the aristocratic life\nI have failed. Instead I've discovered it--and found myself out. I'm an\noverstrung man. I go harshly and continuously for one idea. I live as I\nride. I blunder through my fences, I take off too soon. I've no natural\nease of mind or conduct or body. I am straining to keep hold of a thing\ntoo big for me and do a thing beyond my ability. Only after Prothero's\ndeath was it possible for me to realize the prig I have always been,\nfirst as regards him and then as regards Amanda and my mother and every\none. A necessary unavoidable priggishness....\" I do not see how\ncertain things can be done without prigs, people, that is to say, so\nconcentrated and specialized in interest as to be a trifle inhuman, so\nresolved as to be rather rhetorical and forced.... All things must begin\nwith clumsiness, there is no assurance about pioneers....\n\n\"Some one has to talk about aristocracy, some one has to explain\naristocracy.... But the very essence of aristocracy, as I conceive it,\nis that it does not explain nor talk about itself....\n\n\"After all it doesn't matter what I am.... It's just a private vexation\nthat I haven't got where I meant to get. That does not affect the truth\nI have to tell....\n\n\"If one has to speak the truth with the voice of a prig, still one must\nspeak the truth. I have worked out some very considerable things in my\nresearch, and the time has come when I must set them out clearly and\nplainly. That is my job anyhow. My journey to London to release Amanda\nwill be just the end of my adolescence and the beginning of my real\nlife. It will release me from my last entanglement with the fellow\ncreatures I have always failed to make happy.... It's a detail in the\nwork.... And I shall go on.\n\n\"But I shall feel very like a man who goes back for a surgical\noperation.\n\n\"It's very like that. A surgical operation, and when it is over perhaps\nI shall think no more about it.\n\n\"And beyond these things there are great masses of work to be done. So\nfar I have but cleared up for myself a project and outline of living. I\nmust begin upon these masses now, I must do what I can upon the details,\nand, presently, I shall see more clearly where other men are working to\nthe same ends....\"\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nBenham's expedition to China with Prothero was essentially a wrestle\nbetween his high resolve to work out his conception of the noble life to\nthe utmost limit and his curiously invincible affection and sympathy for\nthe earthliness of that inglorious little don. Although Benham insisted\nupon the dominance of life by noble imaginations and relentless\nreasonableness, he would never altogether abandon the materialism of\nlife. Prothero had once said to him, \"You are the advocate of the brain\nand I of the belly. Only, only we respect each other.\" And at another\ntime, \"You fear emotions and distrust sensations. I invite them. You do\nnot drink gin because you think it would make you weep. But if I could\nnot weep in any other way I would drink gin.\" And it was under\nthe influence of Prothero that Benham turned from the haughty\nintellectualism, the systematized superiorities and refinements, the\ncaste marks and defensive dignities of India to China, that great\nteeming stinking tank of humorous yellow humanity.\n\nBenham had gone to Prothero again after a bout of elevated idealism.\nIt was only very slowly that he reconciled his mind to the idea of an\nentirely solitary pursuit of his aristocratic dream. For some time as\nhe went about the world he was trying to bring himself into relationship\nwith the advanced thinkers, the liberal-minded people who seemed to\npromise at least a mental and moral co-operation. Yet it is difficult to\nsee what co-operation was possible unless it was some sort of agreement\nthat presently they should all shout together. And it was after a\ncertain pursuit of Rabindranath Tagore, whom he met in Hampstead, that a\nhorror of perfect manners and perfect finish came upon him, and he fled\nfrom that starry calm to the rich uncleanness of the most undignified\nfellow of Trinity. And as an advocate and exponent of the richness of\nthe lower levels of life, as the declared antagonist of caste and of\nthe uttermost refinements of pride, Prothero went with Benham by way of\nSiberia to the Chinese scene.\n\nTheir controversy was perceptible at every dinner-table in their\nchoice of food and drink. Benham was always wary and Prothero always\nappreciative. It peeped out in the distribution of their time, in the\ndirection of their glances. Whenever women walked about, Prothero gave\nway to a sort of ethnological excitement. \"That girl--a wonderful racial\ntype.\" But in Moscow he was sentimental. He insisted on going again to\nthe Cosmopolis Bazaar, and when he had ascertained that Anna Alexievna\nhad vanished and left no trace he prowled the streets until the small\nhours.\n\nIn the eastward train he talked intermittently of her. \"I should have\ndefied Cambridge,\" he said.\n\nBut at every stopping station he got out upon the platform\nethnologically alert....\n\nTheoretically Benham was disgusted with Prothero. Really he was not\ndisgusted at all. There was something about Prothero like a sparrow,\nlike a starling, like a Scotch terrier.... These, too, are morally\nobjectionable creatures that do not disgust....\n\nProthero discoursed much upon the essential goodness of Russians. He\nsaid they were a people of genius, that they showed it in their faults\nand failures just as much as in their virtues and achievements. He\nextolled the \"germinating disorder\" of Moscow far above the \"implacable\ndiscipline\" of Berlin. Only a people of inferior imagination, a base\nmaterialist people, could so maintain its attention upon precision and\ncleanliness. Benham was roused to defence against this paradox. \"But all\nexaltation neglects,\" said Prothero. \"No religion has ever boasted that\nits saints were spick and span.\" This controversy raged between them in\nthe streets of Irkutsk. It was still burning while they picked their way\nthrough the indescribable filth of Pekin.\n\n\"You say that all this is a fine disdain for material things,\" said\nBenham. \"But look out there!\"\n\nApt to their argument a couple of sturdy young women came shuffling\nalong, cleaving the crowd in the narrow street by virtue of a single\nword and two brace of pails of human ordure.\n\n\"That is not a fine disdain for material things,\" said Benham. \"That is\nmerely individualism and unsystematic living.\"\n\n\"A mere phase of frankness. Only frankness is left to them now. The\nManchus crippled them, spoilt their roads and broke their waterways.\nEuropean intervention paralyses every attempt they make to establish\norder on their own lines. In the Ming days China did not reek.... And,\nanyhow, Benham, it's better than the silly waste of London....\"\n\nAnd in a little while Prothero discovered that China had tried Benham\nand found him wanting, centuries and dynasties ago.\n\nWhat was this new-fangled aristocratic man, he asked, but the ideal of\nConfucius, the superior person, \"the son of the King\"? There you had the\nvery essence of Benham, the idea of self-examination, self-preparation\nunder a vague Theocracy. (\"Vaguer,\" said Benham, \"for the Confucian\nHeaven could punish and reward.\") Even the elaborate sham modesty of the\ntwo dreams was the same. Benham interrupted and protested with heat. And\nthis Confucian idea of the son of the King, Prothero insisted, had been\nthe cause of China's paralysis. \"My idea of nobility is not traditional\nbut expectant,\" said Benham. \"After all, Confucianism has held together\na great pacific state far longer than any other polity has ever lasted.\nI'll accept your Confucianism. I've not the slightest objection to\nfinding China nearer salvation than any other land. Do but turn it round\nso that it looks to the future and not to the past, and it will be the\nbest social and political culture in the world. That, indeed, is what\nis happening. Mix Chinese culture with American enterprise and you will\nhave made a new lead for mankind.\"\n\nFrom that Benham drove on to discoveries. \"When a man thinks of the past\nhe concentrates on self; when he thinks of the future he radiates from\nself. Call me a neo-Confucian; with the cone opening forward away from\nme, instead of focussing on me....\"\n\n\"You make me think of an extinguisher,\" said Prothero.\n\n\"You know I am thinking of a focus,\" said Benham. \"But all your thought\nnow has become caricature.... You have stopped thinking. You are\nfighting after making up your mind....\"\n\nProthero was a little disconcerted by Benham's prompt endorsement of his\nChinese identification. He had hoped it would be exasperating. He tried\nto barb his offence. He amplified the indictment. All cultures must\nbe judged by their reaction and fatigue products, and Confucianism had\nproduced formalism, priggishness, humbug.... No doubt its ideals had had\ntheir successes; they had unified China, stamped the idea of universal\npeace and good manners upon the greatest mass of population in the\nworld, paved the way for much beautiful art and literature and living.\n\"But in the end, all your stern orderliness, Benham,\" said Prothero,\n\"only leads to me. The human spirit rebels against this everlasting\narmour on the soul. After Han came T'ang. Have you never read Ling Po?\nThere's scraps of him in English in that little book you have--what is\nit?--the LUTE OF JADE? He was the inevitable Epicurean; the Omar Khayyam\nafter the Prophet. Life must relax at last....\"\n\n\"No!\" cried Benham. \"If it is traditional, I admit, yes; but if it is\ncreative, no....\"\n\nUnder the stimulation of their undying controversy Benham was driven to\ncloser enquiries into Chinese thought. He tried particularly to get to\nmental grips with English-speaking Chinese. \"We still know nothing of\nChina,\" said Prothero. \"Most of the stuff we have been told about this\ncountry is mere middle-class tourists' twaddle. We send merchants from\nBrixton and missionaries from Glasgow, and what doesn't remind them of\nthese delectable standards seems either funny to them or wicked. I admit\nthe thing is slightly pot-bound, so to speak, in the ancient characters\nand the ancient traditions, but for all that, they KNOW, they HAVE, what\nall the rest of the world has still to find and get. When they begin to\nspeak and write in a modern way and handle modern things and break into\nthe soil they have scarcely touched, the rest of the world will find\njust how much it is behind.... Oh! not soldiering; the Chinese are not\nsuch fools as that, but LIFE....\"\n\nBenham was won to a half belief in these assertions.\n\nHe came to realize more and more clearly that while India dreams or\nwrestles weakly in its sleep, while Europe is still hopelessly and\nfoolishly given over to militant monarchies, racial vanities, delirious\nreligious feuds and an altogether imbecile fumbling with loaded\nguns, China, even more than America, develops steadily into a massive\npossibility of ordered and aristocratic liberalism....\n\nThe two men followed their associated and disconnected paths. Through\nBenham's chance speeches and notes, White caught glimpses, as one might\ncatch glimpses through a moving trellis, of that bilateral adventure. He\nsaw Benham in conversation with liberal-minded mandarins, grave-faced,\nbald-browed persons with disciplined movements, who sat with their hands\nthrust into their sleeves talking excellent English; while Prothero\npursued enquiries of an intenser, more recondite sort with gentlemen of\na more confidential type. And, presently, Prothero began to discover and\ndiscuss the merits of opium.\n\nFor if one is to disavow all pride and priggishness, if one is to\nfind the solution of life's problem in the rational enjoyment of one's\nsensations, why should one not use opium? It is art materialized.\nIt gives tremendous experiences with a minimum of exertion, and if\npresently its gifts diminish one need but increase the quantity.\nMoreover, it quickens the garrulous mind, and steadies the happiness of\nlove. Across the varied adventures of Benham's journey in China fell the\nshadow first of a suspicion and then of a certainty....\n\nThe perfected and ancient vices of China wrapped about Prothero like\nsome tainted but scented robe, and all too late Benham sought to drag\nhim away. And then in a passion of disgust turned from him.\n\n\"To this,\" cried Benham, \"one comes! Save for pride and fierceness!\"\n\n\"Better this than cruelty,\" said Prothero talking quickly and clearly\nbecause of the evil thing in his veins. \"You think that you are the only\nexplorer of life, Benham, but while you toil up the mountains I board\nthe house-boat and float down the stream. For you the stars, for me the\nmusic and the lanterns. You are the son of a mountaineering don, and I\nam a Chinese philosopher of the riper school. You force yourself beyond\nfear of pain, and I force myself beyond fear of consequences. What\nare we either of us but children groping under the black cloak of our\nMaker?--who will not blind us with his light. Did he not give us also\nthese lusts, the keen knife and the sweetness, these sensations that are\nlike pineapple smeared with saltpetre, like salted olives from heaven,\nlike being flayed with delight.... And did he not give us dreams\nfantastic beyond any lust whatever? What is the good of talking? Speak\nto your own kind. I have gone, Benham. I am lost already. There is\nno resisting any more, since I have drugged away resistance. Why then\nshould I come back? I know now the symphonies of the exalted nerves; I\ncan judge; and I say better lie and hear them to the end than come back\nagain to my old life, to my little tin-whistle solo, my--effort! My\nEFFORT!... I ruin my body. I know. But what of that?... I shall soon be\nthin and filthy. What of the grape-skin when one has had the pulp?\"\n\n\"But,\" said Benham, \"the cleanness of life!\"\n\n\"While I perish,\" said Prothero still more wickedly, \"I say good\nthings....\"\n\n\n\n13\n\n\nWhite had a vision of a great city with narrow crowded streets, hung\nwith lank banners and gay with vertical vermilion labels, and of a\npleasant large low house that stood in a garden on a hillside, a garden\nset with artificial stones and with beasts and men and lanterns of white\nporcelain, a garden which overlooked this city. Here it was that Benham\nstayed and talked with his host, a man robed in marvellous silks and\nsubtle of speech even in the European languages he used, and meanwhile\nProthero, it seemed, had gone down into the wickedness of the town\nbelow. It was a very great town indeed, spreading for miles along the\nbanks of a huge river, a river that divided itself indolently into three\nshining branches so as to make islands of the central portion of the\nplace. And on this river swarmed for ever a vast flotilla of ships and\nboats, boats in which people lived, boats in which they sought pleasure,\nmoored places of assembly, high-pooped junks, steamboats, passenger\nsampans, cargo craft, such a water town in streets and lanes, endless\nmiles of it, as no other part of the world save China can display. In\nthe daylight it was gay with countless sunlit colours embroidered upon\na fabric of yellow and brown, at night it glittered with a hundred\nthousand lights that swayed and quivered and were reflected quiveringly\nupon the black flowing waters.\n\nAnd while Benham sat and talked in the garden above came a messenger who\nwas for some reason very vividly realized by White's imagination. He was\na tall man with lack-lustre eyes and sunken cheeks that made his cheek\nbones very prominent, and gave his thin-lipped mouth something of the\ngeniality of a skull, and the arm he thrust out of his yellow robe to\nhand Prothero's message to Benham was lean as a pole. So he stood out in\nWhite's imagination, against the warm afternoon sky and the brown roofs\nand blue haze of the great town below, and was with one exception the\ndistinctest thing in the story. The message he bore was scribbled by\nProthero himself in a nerveless scrawl: \"Send a hundred dollars by this\nman. I am in a frightful fix.\"\n\nNow Benham's host had been twitting him with the European patronage of\nopium, and something in this message stirred his facile indignation.\nTwice before he had had similar demands. And on the whole they had\nseemed to him to be unreasonable demands. He was astonished that while\nhe was sitting and talking of the great world-republic of the future and\nthe secret self-directed aristocracy that would make it possible,\nhis own friend, his chosen companion, should thus, by this inglorious\nrequest and this ungainly messenger, disavow him. He felt a wave of\nintense irritation.\n\n\"No,\" he said, \"I will not.\"\n\nAnd he was too angry to express himself in any language understandable\nby his messenger.\n\nHis host intervened and explained after a few questions that the\noccasion was serious. Prothero, it seemed, had been gambling.\n\n\"No,\" said Benham. \"He is shameless. Let him do what he can.\"\n\nThe messenger was still reluctant to go.\n\nAnd scarcely had he gone before misgivings seized Benham.\n\n\"Where IS your friend?\" asked the mandarin.\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Benham.\n\n\"But they will keep him! They may do all sorts of things when they find\nhe is lying to them.\"\n\n\"Lying to them?\"\n\n\"About your help.\"\n\n\"Stop that man,\" cried Benham suddenly realizing his mistake. But\nwhen the servants went to stop the messenger their intentions were\nmisunderstood, and the man dashed through the open gate of the garden\nand made off down the winding road.\n\n\"Stop him!\" cried Benham, and started in pursuit, suddenly afraid for\nProthero.\n\nThe Chinese are a people of great curiosity, and a small pebble\nsometimes starts an avalanche....\n\nWhite pieced together his conception of the circles of disturbance that\nspread out from Benham's pursuit of Prothero's flying messenger.\n\nFor weeks and months the great town had been uneasy in all its ways\nbecause of the insurgent spirits from the south and the disorder from\nthe north, because of endless rumours and incessant intrigue. The stupid\nmanoeuvres of one European \"power\" against another, the tactlessness of\nmissionaries, the growing Chinese disposition to meet violence and force\nwith violence and force, had fermented and brewed the possibility of an\noutbreak. The sudden resolve of Benham to get at once to Prothero was\nlike the firing of a mine. This tall, pale-faced, incomprehensible\nstranger charging through the narrow streets that led to the\npleasure-boats in the south river seemed to many a blue-clad citizen\nlike the White Peril embodied. Behind him came the attendants of\nthe rich man up the hill; but they surely were traitors to help this\nstranger.\n\nBefore Benham could at all realize what was happening he found his way\nto the river-boat on which he supposed Prothero to be detained, barred\nby a vigorous street fight. Explanations were impossible; he joined in\nthe fight.\n\nFor three days that fight developed round the mystery of Prothero's\ndisappearance.\n\nIt was a complicated struggle into which the local foreign traders\non the river-front and a detachment of modern drilled troops from the\nup-river barracks were presently drawn. It was a struggle that was never\nclearly explained, and at the end of it they found Prothero's body flung\nout upon a waste place near a little temple on the river bank, stabbed\nwhile he was asleep....\n\nAnd from the broken fragments of description that Benham let fall, White\nhad an impression of him hunting for all those three days through the\nstrange places of a Chinese city, along narrow passages, over queer\nVenetian-like bridges, through the vast spaces of empty warehouses, in\nthe incense-scented darkness of temple yards, along planks that passed\nto the dark hulls of secret barges, in quick-flying boats that slipped\nnoiselessly among the larger craft, and sometimes he hunted alone,\nsometimes in company, sometimes black figures struggled in the darkness\nagainst dim-lit backgrounds and sometimes a swarm of shining yellow\nfaces screamed and shouted through the torn paper windows.... And\nthen at the end of this confused effect of struggle, this Chinese\nkinematograph film, one last picture jerked into place and stopped and\nstood still, a white wall in the sunshine come upon suddenly round a\ncorner, a dirty flagged passage and a stiff crumpled body that had for\nthe first time an inexpressive face....\n\n\n\n14\n\n\nBenham sat at a table in the smoking-room of the Sherborough Hotel\nat Johannesburg and told of these things. White watched him from an\narmchair. And as he listened he noted again the intensification of\nBenham's face, the darkness under his brows, the pallor of his skin, the\ntouch of red in his eyes. For there was still that red gleam in Benham's\neyes; it shone when he looked out of a darkness into a light. And he\nsat forward with his arms folded under him, or moved his long lean hand\nabout over the things on the table.\n\n\"You see,\" he said, \"this is a sort of horror in my mind. Things like\nthis stick in my mind. I am always seeing Prothero now, and it will take\nyears to get this scar off my memory again. Once before--about a horse,\nI had the same kind of distress. And it makes me tender, sore-minded\nabout everything. It will go, of course, in the long run, and it's just\nlike any other ache that lays hold of one. One can't cure it. One has to\nget along with it....\n\n\"I know, White, I ought to have sent that money, but how was I to know\nthen that it was so imperative to send that money?...\n\n\"At the time it seemed just pandering to his vices....\n\n\"I was angry. I shall never subdue that kind of hastiness altogether.\nIt takes me by surprise. Before the messenger was out of sight I had\nrepented....\n\n\"I failed him. I have gone about in the world dreaming of tremendous\nthings and failing most people. My wife too....\"\n\nHe stopped talking for a little time and folded his arms tight and\nstared hard in front of himself, his lips compressed.\n\n\"You see, White,\" he said, with a kind of setting of the teeth, \"this\nis the sort of thing one has to stand. Life is imperfect. Nothing can be\ndone perfectly. And on the whole--\" He spoke still more slowly, \"I would\ngo through again with the very same things that have hurt my people. If\nI had to live over again. I would try to do the things without hurting\nthe people, but I would do the things anyhow. Because I'm raw with\nremorse, it does not follow that on the whole I am not doing right.\nRight doing isn't balm. If I could have contrived not to hurt these\npeople as I have done, it would have been better, just as it would be\nbetter to win a battle without any killed or wounded. I was clumsy with\nthem and they suffered, I suffer for their suffering, but still I have\nto stick to the way I have taken. One's blunders are accidents. If\none thing is clearer than another it is that the world isn't\naccident-proof....\n\n\"But I wish I had sent those dollars to Prothero.... God! White, but\nI lie awake at night thinking of that messenger as he turned away....\nTrying to stop him....\n\n\"I didn't send those dollars. So fifty or sixty people were killed\nand many wounded.... There for all practical purposes the thing ends.\nPerhaps it will serve to give me a little charity for some other fool's\nhaste and blundering....\n\n\"I couldn't help it, White. I couldn't help it....\n\n\"The main thing, the impersonal thing, goes on. One thinks, one learns,\none adds one's contribution of experience and understanding. The spirit\nof the race goes on to light and comprehension. In spite of accidents.\nIn spite of individual blundering.\n\n\"It would be absurd anyhow to suppose that nobility is so easy as to\ncome slick and true on every occasion....\n\n\"If one gives oneself to any long aim one must reckon with minor\ndisasters. This Research I undertook grows and grows. I believe in it\nmore and more. The more it asks from me the more I give to it. When I\nwas a youngster I thought the thing I wanted was just round the corner.\nI fancied I would find out the noble life in a year or two, just what\nit was, just where it took one, and for the rest of my life I would live\nit. Finely. But I am just one of a multitude of men, each one going a\nlittle wrong, each one achieving a little right. And the noble life is\na long, long way ahead.... We are working out a new way of living for\nmankind, a new rule, a new conscience. It's no small job for all of us.\nThere must be lifetimes of building up and lifetimes of pulling down and\ntrying again. Hope and disappointments and much need for philosophy....\nI see myself now for the little workman I am upon this tremendous\nundertaking. And all my life hereafter goes to serve it....\"\n\nHe turned his sombre eyes upon his friend. He spoke with a grim\nenthusiasm. \"I'm a prig. I'm a fanatic, White. But I have something\nclear, something better worth going on with than any adventure of\npersonal relationship could possibly be....\"\n\nAnd suddenly he began to tell White as plainly as he could of the faith\nthat had grown up in his mind. He spoke with a touch of defiance, with\nthe tense force of a man who shrinks but overcomes his shame. \"I will\ntell you what I believe.\"\n\nHe told of his early dread of fear and baseness, and of the slow\ndevelopment, expansion and complication of his idea of self-respect\nuntil he saw that there is no honour nor pride for a man until he refers\nhis life to ends and purposes beyond himself. An aristocrat must be\nloyal. So it has ever been, but a modern aristocrat must also be\nlucid; there it is that one has at once the demand for kingship and the\nrepudiation of all existing states and kings. In this manner he had\ncome to his idea of a great world republic that must replace the little\nwarring kingdoms of the present, to the conception of an unseen kingship\nruling the whole globe, to his King Invisible, who is the Lord of Truth\nand all sane loyalty. \"There,\" he said, \"is the link of our order, the\nnew knighthood, the new aristocracy, that must at last rule the earth.\nThere is our Prince. He is in me, he is in you; he is latent in all\nmankind. I have worked this out and tried it and lived it, and I know\nthat outwardly and inwardly this is the way a man must live, or else be\na poor thing and a base one. On great occasions and small occasions I\nhave failed myself a thousand times, but no failure lasts if your faith\nlasts. What I have learnt, what I have thought out and made sure, I\nwant now to tell the world. Somehow I will tell it, as a book I suppose,\nthough I do not know if I shall ever be able to make a book. But I have\naway there in London or with me here all the masses of notes I have\nmade in my search for the life that is worth while living.... We who are\nself-appointed aristocrats, who are not ashamed of kingship, must speak\nto one another....\n\n\"We can have no organization because organizations corrupt....\n\n\"No recognition....\n\n\"But we can speak plainly....\"\n\n(As he talked his voice was for a space drowned by the jingle and voices\nof mounted police riding past the hotel.)\n\n\"But on one side your aristocracy means revolution,\" said White. \"It\nbecomes a political conspiracy.\"\n\n\"Manifestly. An open conspiracy. It denies the king upon the stamps and\nthe flag upon the wall. It is the continual proclamation of the Republic\nof Mankind.\"\n\n\n\n15\n\n\nThe earlier phases of violence in the Rand outbreak in 1913 were\nmanifest rather in the outskirts of Johannesburg than at the centre.\n\"Pulling out\" was going on first at this mine and then that, there were\nriots in Benoni, attacks on strike breakers and the smashing up of\na number of houses. It was not until July the 4th that, with the\nsuppression of a public meeting in the market-place, Johannesburg itself\nbecame the storm centre.\n\nBenham and White were present at this marketplace affair, a confused\ncrowded occasion, in which a little leaven of active men stirred through\na large uncertain multitude of decently dressed onlookers. The whole\nbig square was astir, a swaying crowd of men. A ramshackle platform\nimprovised upon a trolley struggled through the swarming straw hats to a\nstreet corner, and there was some speaking. At first it seemed as though\nmilitary men were using this platform, and then it was manifestly in\npossession of an excited knot of labour leaders with red rosettes. The\nmilitary men had said their say and got down. They came close by Benham,\npushing their way across the square. \"We've warned them,\" said one. A\nred flag, like some misunderstood remark at a tea-party, was fitfully\nvisible and incomprehensible behind the platform. Somebody was either\npitched or fell off the platform. One could hear nothing from the\nspeakers except a minute bleating....\n\nThen there were shouts that the police were charging. A number of\nmounted men trotted into the square. The crowd began a series of short\nrushes that opened lanes for the passage of the mounted police as they\nrode to and fro. These men trotted through the crowd, scattering knots\nof people. They carried pick-handles, but they did not seem to be\nhitting with them. It became clear that they aimed at the capture of\nthe trolley. There was only a feeble struggle for the trolley; it was\ncaptured and hauled through the scattered spectators in the square\nto the protection of a small impassive body of regular cavalry at the\nopposite corner. Then quite a number of people seemed to be getting\nexcited and fighting. They appeared to be vaguely fighting the\nfoot-police, and the police seemed to be vaguely pushing through\nthem and dispersing them. The roof of a little one-story shop became\nprominent as a centre of vigorous stone-throwing.\n\nIt was no sort of battle. Merely the normal inconsecutiveness of human\naffairs had become exaggerated and pugnacious. A meeting was being\nprevented, and the police engaged in the operation were being pelted or\nobstructed. Mostly people were just looking on.\n\n\"It amounts to nothing,\" said Benham. \"Even if they held a meeting, what\ncould happen? Why does the Government try to stop it?\"\n\nThe drifting and charging and a little booing went on for some time.\nEvery now and then some one clambered to a point of vantage, began\na speech and was pulled down by policemen. And at last across the\nconfusion came an idea, like a wind across a pond.\n\nThe strikers were to go to the Power Station.\n\nThat had the effect of a distinct move in the game. The Power Station\nwas the centre of Johannesburg's light and energy. There if anywhere it\nwould be possible to express one's disapproval of the administration,\none's desire to embarrass and confute it. One could stop all sorts of\nthings from the Power Station. At any rate it was a repartee to the\nsuppression of the meeting. Everybody seemed gladdened by a definite\nproject.\n\nBenham and White went with the crowd.\n\nAt the intersection of two streets they were held up for a time; the\nscattered drift of people became congested. Gliding slowly across the\nmass came an electric tram, an entirely unbattered tram with even its\nglass undamaged, and then another and another. Strikers, with the\nhappy expression of men who have found something expressive to do, were\nescorting the trams off the street. They were being meticulously careful\nwith them. Never was there less mob violence in a riot. They walked by\nthe captured cars almost deferentially, like rough men honoured by a\nreal lady's company. And when White and Benham reached the Power House\nthe marvel grew. The rioters were already in possession and going freely\nover the whole place, and they had injured nothing. They had stopped\nthe engines, but they had not even disabled them. Here too manifestly a\nmajority of the people were, like White and Benham, merely lookers-on.\n\n\"But this is the most civilized rioting,\" said Benham. \"It isn't\nrioting; it's drifting. Just as things drifted in Moscow. Because nobody\nhas the rudder....\n\n\"What maddens me,\" he said, \"is the democracy of the whole thing. White!\nI HATE this modern democracy. Democracy and inequality! Was there ever\nan absurder combination? What is the good of a social order in which the\nmen at the top are commoner, meaner stuff than the men underneath, the\nsame stuff, just spoilt, spoilt by prosperity and opportunity and the\nconceit that comes with advantage? This trouble wants so little, just\na touch of aristocracy, just a little cultivated magnanimity, just an\ninkling of responsibility, and the place might rise instantly out of all\nthis squalor and evil temper.... What does all this struggle here amount\nto? On one side unintelligent greed, unintelligent resentment on the\nother; suspicion everywhere....\n\n\"And you know, White, at bottom THEY ALL WANT TO BE DECENT!\n\n\"If only they had light enough in their brains to show them how.\nIt's such a plain job they have here too, a new city, the simplest\nindustries, freedom from war, everything to make a good life for men,\nprosperity, glorious sunshine, a kind of happiness in the air. And\nmismanagement, fear, indulgence, jealousy, prejudice, stupidity, poison\nit all. A squabble about working on a Saturday afternoon, a squabble\nembittered by this universal shadow of miner's phthisis that the masters\nwere too incapable and too mean to prevent.\n\n\"Oh, God!\" cried Benham, \"when will men be princes and take hold of\nlife? When will the kingship in us wake up and come to its own?... Look\nat this place! Look at this place!... The easy, accessible happiness!\nThe manifest prosperity. The newness and the sunshine. And the silly\nbitterness, the rage, the mischief and miseries!...\"\n\nAnd then: \"It's not our quarrel....\"\n\n\"It's amazing how every human quarrel draws one in to take sides.\nLife is one long struggle against the incidental. I can feel my anger\ngathering against the Government here in spite of my reason. I want to\ngo and expostulate. I have a ridiculous idea that I ought to go off to\nLord Gladstone or Botha and expostulate.... What good would it do?\nThey move in the magic circles of their own limitations, an official, a\npolitician--how would they put it?--'with many things to consider....'\n\n\"It's my weakness to be drawn into quarrels. It's a thing I have to\nguard against....\n\n\"What does it all amount to? It is like a fight between navvies in\na tunnel to settle the position of the Pole star. It doesn't concern\nus.... Oh! it doesn't indeed concern us. It's a scuffle in the darkness,\nand our business, the business of all brains, the only permanent good\nwork is to light up the world.... There will be mischief and hatred\nhere and suppression and then forgetfulness, and then things will go on\nagain, a little better or a little worse....\"\n\n\"I'm tired of this place, White, and of all such places. I'm tired of\nthe shouting and running, the beating and shooting. I'm sick of all the\nconfusions of life's experience, which tells only of one need amidst an\nendless multitude of distresses. I've seen my fill of wars and disputes\nand struggles. I see now how a man may grow weary at last of life and\nits disorders, its unreal exacting disorders, its blunders and its\nremorse. No! I want to begin upon the realities I have made for myself.\nFor they are the realities. I want to go now to some quiet corner\nwhere I can polish what I have learnt, sort out my accumulations, be\nundisturbed by these transitory symptomatic things....\n\n\"What was that boy saying? They are burning the STAR office.... Well,\nlet them....\"\n\nAnd as if to emphasize his detachment, his aversion, from the things\nthat hurried through the night about them, from the red flare in the\nsky and the distant shouts and revolver shots and scuffling flights down\nside streets, he began to talk again of aristocracy and the making of\ngreatness and a new great spirit in men. All the rest of his life, he\nsaid, must be given to that. He would say his thing plainly and honestly\nand afterwards other men would say it clearly and beautifully; here it\nwould touch a man and there it would touch a man; the Invisible King in\nus all would find himself and know himself a little in this and a little\nin that, and at last a day would come, when fair things and fine things\nwould rule the world and such squalor as this about them would be as\nimpossible any more for men as a Stone Age Corroboree....\n\nLate or soon?\n\nBenham sought for some loose large measure of time.\n\n\"Before those constellations above us have changed their shapes....\n\n\"Does it matter if we work at something that will take a hundred years\nor ten thousand years? It will never come in our lives, White. Not soon\nenough for that. But after that everything will be soon--when one comes\nto death then everything is at one's fingertips--I can feel that greater\nworld I shall never see as one feels the dawn coming through the last\ndarkness....\"\n\n\n\n16\n\n\nThe attack on the Rand Club began while Benham and White were at lunch\nin the dining-room at the Sherborough on the day following the burning\nof the STAR office. The Sherborough dining-room was on the first floor,\nand the Venetian window beside their table opened on to a verandah\nabove a piazza. As they talked they became aware of an excitement in the\nstreet below, shouting and running and then a sound of wheels and the\ntramp of a body of soldiers marching quickly. White stood up and looked.\n\"They're seizing the stuff in the gunshops,\" he said, sitting down\nagain. \"It's amazing they haven't done it before.\"\n\nThey went on eating and discussing the work of a medical mission at\nMukden that had won Benham's admiration....\n\nA revolver cracked in the street and there was a sound of glass\nsmashing. Then more revolver shots. \"That's at the big club at the\ncorner, I think,\" said Benham and went out upon the verandah.\n\nUp and down the street mischief was afoot. Outside the Rand Club in\nthe cross street a considerable mass of people had accumulated, and\nwas being hustled by a handful of khaki-clad soldiers. Down the street\npeople were looking in the direction of the market-place and then\nsuddenly a rush of figures flooded round the corner, first a froth\nof scattered individuals and then a mass, a column, marching with an\nappearance of order and waving a flag. It was a poorly disciplined body,\nit fringed out into a swarm of sympathizers and spectators upon the\nside walk, and at the head of it two men disputed. They seemed to be\ndiffering about the direction of the whole crowd. Suddenly one smote the\nother with his fist, a blow that hurled him sideways, and then turned\nwith a triumphant gesture to the following ranks, waving his arms in\nthe air. He was a tall lean man, hatless and collarless, greyhaired and\nwild-eyed. On he came, gesticulating gauntly, past the hotel.\n\nAnd then up the street something happened. Benham's attention was turned\nround to it by a checking, by a kind of catch in the breath, on the part\nof the advancing procession under the verandah.\n\nThe roadway beyond the club had suddenly become clear. Across it a dozen\nsoldiers had appeared and dismounted methodically and lined out, with\ntheir carbines in readiness. The mounted men at the club corner had\nvanished, and the people there had swayed about towards this new\nthreat. Quite abruptly the miscellaneous noises of the crowd ceased.\nUnderstanding seized upon every one.\n\nThese soldiers were going to fire....\n\nThe brown uniformed figures moved like automata; the rifle shots rang\nout almost in one report....\n\nThere was a rush in the crowd towards doorways and side streets, an\nenquiring pause, the darting back of a number of individuals into the\nroadway and then a derisive shouting. Nobody had been hit. The soldiers\nhad fired in the air.\n\n\"But this is a stupid game,\" said Benham. \"Why did they fire at all?\"\n\nThe tall man who had led the mob had run out into the middle of the\nroad. His commando was a little disposed to assume a marginal position,\nand it had to be reassured. He was near enough for Benham to see his\nface. For a time it looked anxious and thoughtful. Then he seemed to\njump to his decision. He unbuttoned and opened his coat wide as if\ndefying the soldiers. \"Shoot,\" he bawled, \"Shoot, if you dare!\"\n\nA little uniform movement of the soldiers answered him. The small figure\nof the officer away there was inaudible. The coat of the man below\nflapped like the wings of a crowing cock before a breast of dirty shirt,\nthe hoarse voice cracked with excitement, \"Shoot, if you dare. Shoot, if\nyou dare! See!\"\n\nCame the metallic bang of the carbines again, and in the instant the\nleader collapsed in the road, a sprawl of clothes, hit by half a dozen\nbullets. It was an extraordinary effect. As though the figure had been\ndeflated. It was incredible that a moment before this thing had been a\nman, an individual, a hesitating complicated purpose.\n\n\"Good God!\" cried Benham, \"but--this is horrible!\"\n\nThe heap of garments lay still. The red hand that stretched out towards\nthe soldiers never twitched.\n\nThe spectacular silence broke into a confusion of sounds, women\nshrieked, men cursed, some fled, some sought a corner from which they\nmight still see, others pressed forward. \"Go for the swine!\" bawled a\nvoice, a third volley rattled over the heads of the people, and in\nthe road below a man with a rifle halted, took aim, and answered the\nsoldiers' fire. \"Look out!\" cried White who was watching the soldiers,\nand ducked. \"This isn't in the air!\"\n\nCame a straggling volley again, like a man running a metal hammer very\nrapidly along iron corrugations, and this time people were dropping all\nover the road. One white-faced man not a score of yards away fell with\na curse and a sob, struggled up, staggered for some yards with blood\nrunning abundantly from his neck, and fell and never stirred again.\nAnother went down upon his back clumsily in the roadway and lay wringing\nhis hands faster and faster until suddenly with a movement like a sigh\nthey dropped inert by his side. A straw-hatted youth in a flannel suit\nran and stopped and ran again. He seemed to be holding something red and\nstrange to his face with both hands; above them his eyes were round\nand anxious. Blood came out between his fingers. He went right past\nthe hotel and stumbled and suddenly sprawled headlong at the opposite\ncorner. The majority of the crowd had already vanished into doorways and\nside streets. But there was still shouting and there was still a remnant\nof amazed and angry men in the roadway--and one or two angry women. They\nwere not fighting. Indeed they were unarmed, but if they had had weapons\nnow they would certainly have used them.\n\n\"But this is preposterous!\" cried Benham. \"Preposterous. Those soldiers\nare never going to shoot again! This must stop.\"\n\nHe stood hesitating for a moment and then turned about and dashed for\nthe staircase. \"Good Heaven!\" cried White. \"What are you going to do?\"\n\nBenham was going to stop that conflict very much as a man might go to\nstop a clock that is striking unwarrantably and amazingly. He was going\nto stop it because it annoyed his sense of human dignity.\n\nWhite hesitated for a moment and then followed, crying \"Benham!\"\n\nBut there was no arresting this last outbreak of Benham's all too\nimpatient kingship. He pushed aside a ducking German waiter who was\npeeping through the glass doors, and rushed out of the hotel. With\na gesture of authority he ran forward into the middle of the street,\nholding up his hand, in which he still held his dinner napkin clenched\nlike a bomb. White believes firmly that Benham thought he would be able\nto dominate everything. He shouted out something about \"Foolery!\"\n\nHaroun al Raschid was flinging aside all this sublime indifference to\ncurrent things....\n\nBut the carbines spoke again.\n\nBenham seemed to run unexpectedly against something invisible. He\nspun right round and fell down into a sitting position. He sat looking\nsurprised.\n\nAfter one moment of blank funk White drew out his pocket handkerchief,\nheld it arm high by way of a white flag, and ran out from the piazza of\nthe hotel.\n\n\n\n17\n\n\n\"Are you hit?\" cried White dropping to his knees and making himself as\ncompact as possible. \"Benham!\"\n\nBenham, after a moment of perplexed thought answered in a strange voice,\na whisper into which a whistling note had been mixed.\n\n\"It was stupid of me to come out here. Not my quarrel. Faults on both\nsides. And now I can't get up. I will sit here a moment and pull myself\ntogether. Perhaps I'm--I must be shot. But it seemed to come--inside\nme.... If I should be hurt. Am I hurt?... Will you see to that book of\nmine, White? It's odd. A kind of faintness.... What?\"\n\n\"I will see after your book,\" said White and glanced at his hand because\nit felt wet, and was astonished to discover it bright red. He forgot\nabout himself then, and the fresh flight of bullets down the street.\n\nThe immediate effect of this blood was that he said something more about\nthe book, a promise, a definite promise. He could never recall his\nexact words, but their intention was binding. He conveyed his absolute\nacquiescence with Benham's wishes whatever they were. His life for that\nmoment was unreservedly at his friend's disposal....\n\nWhite never knew if his promise was heard. Benham had stopped speaking\nquite abruptly with that \"What?\"\n\nHe stared in front of him with a doubtful expression, like a man who is\ngoing to be sick, and then, in an instant, every muscle seemed to give\nway, he shuddered, his head flopped, and White held a dead man in his\narms.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Research Magnificent, by H.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1139,"split":"test"}
