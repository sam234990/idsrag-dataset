Using smaller boats, the crew of Surprise tow the ship into a fog bank and evade pursuit. Meanwhile, Aubrey learns from a crewman who saw Acheron being built that it is heavier and faster than Surprise, and the senior officers consider the ship out of their class. Aubrey notes that such a ship could tip the balance of power in Napoleon's favour if allowed to plunder the British whaling fleet at will. He orders pursuit of Acheron, rather than returning to port for repairs. Acheron again ambushes Surprise, but Aubrey slips away in the night by using a clever decoy buoy and ships lamps.\nFollowing the privateer south, Surprise rounds Cape Horn and heads to the Galapagos Islands, where Aubrey is sure Acheron will prey on Britain's whaling fleet. The ship's doctor, Maturin, is interested in the islands' flora and fauna, and Aubrey promises his friend several days' exploration time. When Surprise reaches the Galapagos they recover the survivors of a whaling ship destroyed by Acheron. Realizing the ship is close, Aubrey hastily pursues the privateer. Maturin feels that Aubrey is going back on his word, and is following Acheron more out of pride than duty.\nMarine officer Captain Howard attempts to shoot an albatross, but accidentally hits Maturin. The surgeon's mate informs Aubrey that the bullet and a piece of cloth it took with it must be removed, but the operation should be performed on solid ground. Despite closing on Acheron, Aubrey turns around and takes the doctor back to the Galapagos. Maturin performs surgery on himself using a mirror. Giving up the pursuit of the privateer, Aubrey grants Maturin the chance to explore the island and gather specimens before they head for home. On crossing the island looking for a species of flightless cormorant, the doctor discovers Acheron anchored on the other side of the island. Abandoning most of his specimens, Maturin warns Aubrey, and Surprise readies for battle. Due to Acheron's sturdy hull, Surprise must get in close to deal damage. After observing the camouflage ability of one of Maturin's specimens\u2014a stick insect\u2014Aubrey disguises Surprise as a whaling ship; he hopes the French would move close to capture the valuable ship rather than destroy it. The Acheron falls for the disguise and is disabled. Aubrey leads boarding parties across the wreckage, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat before the ship is captured. Looking for the Acheron's captain, Aubrey is directed to the sickbay, where a French doctor tells him the captain is dead and offers Aubrey the commander's sword.\nAcheron and Surprise are repaired; while Surprise will remain in the Galapagos, the captured Acheron is to be taken to Valpara\u00edso. As Acheron sails away, Maturin mentions that their doctor had died months ago. Realising the French captain deceived him by pretending to be the ship's doctor, Aubrey gives the order to change course to intercept the Acheron and escort her to Valpara\u00edso, and for the crew to assume battle stations. Maturin is again denied the chance to explore the Galapagos, but Aubrey wryly notes that since the bird he seeks is flightless, \"it's not going anywhere\", and the two play a selection of Luigi Boccherini as the crew assumes battle stations and the Surprise turns in pursuit of the Acheron.\n<html>\n<head><title>Master and Commander Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Master and Commander script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Master and Commander script, Master and Commander movie script, Master and Commander film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

     Written by\n\n                 John Collee & Peter Weir\n\n\n\n\n<b>   1. THE OCEAN - DUSK\n<\/b>\n   From blackness, a pattern slowly emerges - shimmering,\n   abstract lines form into waves cresting above steep-sided\n   valleys of water.\n\n   Finally the picture settles into a high, wide shot of the\n   ocean and an adjacent coastline.\n\n   In a corner of the screen, the last rays of sunlight touch a\n   small, dark shape causing it to glow in the gathering\n   darkness: A three-masted sailing vessel.\n\n<b>   2. THE SHIP - DUSK\n<\/b>\n   [   ] She passes close enough to touch: hawsers as thick as a\n   man's trunk, massive black-painted timbers, muzzles of her\n   great guns projecting from every gun-port.\n\n   As the ship glides past and away from us, her name is\n   visible, picked out in dull gold on the transom - Surprise.\n\n<b>   3. ANOTHER ANGLE - DUSK\n<\/b>\n   The ship in silhouette - RUN CAPTION:\n\n           HMS Surprise\n           Armament: 28 guns Crew: 197 souls.\n           Location: Coast of Brazil, November 1806\n           Mission: Intercept and destroy French\n           Privateer, Acheron\n\n\n<b>   5.   THE GREAT CABIN - DUSK\n<\/b>\n   CAPTAIN JACK AUBREY, with his back to us, bends over the\n   table, studying charts.\n\n   His servant, KILLICK, a pig-tailed, ear-ringed man of\n   indeterminate age, refills the glass at his elbow.\n\n   JACK drinks. The glass catches the setting sun as it drops\n   below the great casement windows.\n\n   KILLICK lights a lamp, places it next to his captain and\n   retires.\n<b>                    JACK\n<\/b>          (Absently) Thankee Killick\n\n<b>   4. THE CHARTS:\n<\/b>\n   a beautifully drawn chart of the South American coastline.\n\n   Jack's hands place a second chart on top of the first,\n   bringing the north-east coast of Brazil into view. Then\n   another, each one enlarging the view of the preceding one.\n\n   On the final chart we can read navigational symbols and\n   detailed information in fine copperplate script:\n\n          6 fa. Shoals suddenly to half fa. Rocks\n          (exact position unknown). Hidden reef.\n\n<b>   6. BELOW DECKS - NIGHT\n<\/b>\n   Another lamp illuminates 1st lieutenant TOM PULLINGS, his\n   pleasant open face marred by a diagonal sabre scar running\n   from brow to chin.\n\n   He is making a final tour of inspection before lights out.\n\n<b>7. THE DOCTOR'S CABIN - NIGHT\n<\/b>\nDr STEPHEN MATURIN, a keen naturalist, sits at his desk\nsurrounded by specimen jars, books and scientific\ninstruments.\n\n<b>[   ]\n<\/b>\nTOM PULLINGS glances in as he moves past the cabin door, but\nthe doctor, placing weights on some finely-balanced\nstructure, is too engrossed to notice him.\n\n<b>8. MIDSHIPMAN'S BERTH - NIGHT\n<\/b>\nIn the quarters for the 'young gentlemen', boys trained from\nan early age to become officers, four lads play at marbles.\n\nPETER CALAMY (16) and LORD BLAKENEY (13) are arguing about\nwhether a marble was inside outside the circle as their berth\nmates BOYLE (15) and WILLIAMSON (14) wait for the game to\nresume.\n\n<b>                    BLAKENEY\n<\/b>          In\n<b>                      CALAMY\n<\/b>          Out.\n\n<b>                    BLAKENEY\n<\/b>          In.

It was in I say.\n\nThe lamp moves on, illuminating a fifth midshipman, much\nolder than the rest. This is HOLLOM, aged 24. He's a\nsensitive-looking fellow, idly strumming a guitar, glancing\nup briefly as TOM PULLINGS passes.\n\n<b>9. GUN-DECK - NIGHT\n<\/b>\nBy the galley stove at the forward end of the gun-deck a few\nof the foremast hands enjoy a last smoke and a mug of grog.\n\nFaster Doudle passes his mug to Higgins who guzzles it down\ngreedily\n\nOne man, BECKETT, sits shirtless while another, AWKWARD\nDAVIES, brow furrowed with concentration, tattoos the first\nlink of what will be a great chain round BECKETT's waist.\n\nJOE PLAICE, at 45 one of the oldest men on board, stops in\nthe middle of a story as PULLINGS passes, everyone knuckling\ntheir foreheads in deference to the officer.\n\n<b>10.

QUARTERDECK - NIGHT\n<\/b>\nPullings has joined the officer of the watch, 2nd Lieutenant\nMOWETT, a short tubular man in his early 20s.\n\nJACK climbs up a ladder and we see him properly for the first\ntime: a heavy-set man in his thirties, thick blonde hair\nclubbed at the back\n\nAt the binnacle, by the ship's great wheel. The helmsman,\nBONDEN - a London cockney with a boxer's face - gives JACK\ntheir current course.\n\nJACK nods, then moves to the gunwale with PULLINGS.

The\nbird drops low, flying right by STEPHEN.\n\nAgain a crackle of gunfire, but the bird is apparently\nuninjured, and it banks away, skimming the surface of the\nwater.\n\nSTEPHEN sags to the deck.

BONDEN fires a pistol by his ear, deafening JACK\nand killing the pikeman.\n\nTo either side, privateers are trying to reach them,\nshouting, swearing in English, French and Spanish.\n\nBullets and missiles rain down from above, killing friend and\nfoe alike.\n\nKILLICK is in the thick of it, a pistol in either hand, and\nfrom his lips a high-pitched blood-curdling scream.\n\nAWKWARD DAVIES is foaming at the mouth as he swings a meat-\ncleaver right and left.\n\n<b>286.

A moment's astonishment from HOWARD at the Doctor's\nsurprising skill.\n\nCALAMY fights his way to BLAKENEY who is down on his knees\nstabbing at the legs of the attackers.\n\n<b>290.

Men drown, others struggle to stay afloat,\nclinging to the mass of wreckage floating by the hull.\n\n<b>295.   WAIST OF THE SHIP\n<\/b>\nCheering from the Surprises, demands to surrender in many\nlanguages, some beg for mercy, others fight on.\n\n<b>296.

He smashes the\nchain off a locked-door, releasing a dozen or more prisoners.\n\nEverywhere signs of the lethal blast through the ship's\nstern, bodies, guns upended, shattered timbers.\n\nHe makes his way through to the Great Cabin.\n\n<b>297.
