Tyler Hawkins audits classes at NYU and works at the university bookstore. He has a strained relationship with his businessman father, Charles, because his older brother, Michael, committed suicide years before. Charles ignores his youngest child, Caroline, of whom Tyler is protective.\nOne night with his roommate, Aidan, Tyler gets involved in somebody else's fight and is arrested by Neil. Aiden calls Charles to bail Tyler out, but he does not stick around to have a conversation with his father. Aidan sees Neil dropping Ally off, realizing that she is his daughter. He approaches Tyler with the idea to get back at the detective by persuading him to sleep with and dump Ally. Tyler and Ally go to dinner, kiss at the end of the night, and continue seeing one another. While at Tyler's apartment, Aidan convinces the pair to go to a party, after which Ally is very drunk and ends up crashing there. The following day she and her father argue. Neil slaps her and Ally flees to Tyler's apartment.\nCaroline, a budding artist, is featured in an art show and Tyler asks his father to attend the show. Tyler confronts him in a board room filled with people, which causes his father to explode. Neil's partner recognizes Tyler with Ally on a train, so Neil breaks into Tyler's apartment and confronts him. Tyler provokes Neil by confessing to Aidan's plan and his initial reason for meeting Ally, which forces Tyler to confess to Ally. She leaves and returns home. Aidan visits Ally at her father's home to explain that he is to blame and Tyler is in love with her.\nCaroline is bullied by a classmates at a birthday party where they cut her hair off. Ally and Aidan visit Tyler's mother's apartment where Caroline is sobbing. Tyler accompanies his sister back to school and when her classmates tease her for her new haircut, Tyler turns violent and ends up in jail. Charles is impressed that Tyler stood up for his sister, and they connect. Charles asks Tyler to meet with the lawyers at his office.\nTyler spends the night with Ally and they reveal they love each other after making love. Charles takes Caroline to school. He calls Tyler to let him know this and tell him he'll be late. Tyler is happy his father is spending time with Caroline. He tells Charles he will wait in his office, He sees on Charles's computer, a slideshow of pictures of Tyler, Michael and Caroline when they were younger.\nAfter Charles drops Caroline off at school, she sits in her classroom, where the teacher writes the date on the blackboard as September 11, 2001. Tyler looks out the window of his father's office\u00e2\u0080\u0094which is revealed to be located on the 101st floor of the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Once the 9\/11 terrorist attacks begin, the rest of the family, Aidan and Ally look at the towers before the camera pans over the rubble, showing Tyler's diary. In a voice-over of his diary, Tyler reveals to Michael that he loves him, and he forgives him for killing himself. Tyler is buried next to Michael.\nSome time later, Caroline and Charles seem to have a healthy father-daughter relationship. Aidan, who has since gotten a tattoo of Tyler's name on his arm, is working hard in school and Ally gets on the subway at the same spot where her mother was killed .\n<html>\n<head><title>Remember Me Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Remember Me script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Remember Me script, Remember Me movie script, Remember Me film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

SMITH STREET STATION -- BROOKLYN -- NIGHT                 1\n<\/b><b>\n<\/b>    It's very late. It's quiet. Just the sounds of The City\n<b>\n<\/b>    LINDA SANTANA CRAIG, an attractive Hispanic woman in her\n    thirties, waits at the ELEVATED STATION for the F train.\n<b>\n<\/b>    Linda looks great. She's dressed festively but tastefully.\n    Next to her is her eleven year old DAUGHTER, ALICIA. She is\n    twirling about the platform, still jazzed from the birthday\n    party they attended in The City.\n<b>\n<\/b>    Alicia wears a black dress with a pink cardigan and has a pink\n    handbag. We notice a CHARM BRACELET with four-leaf clovers on\n    her right wrist.\n<b>\n<\/b>    The mother and daughter wait alone at one end of the station\n    platform.\n<b>\n<\/b>    TWO TEENAGE BOYS wait at the other end. They speak soft,\n    SLURRED SPANISH to each other.\n<b>\n<\/b>    Linda gives the boys a glance and evaluates. She watches them\n    as Alicia spits a wad of gum into her mom's open hand.\n<b>\n<\/b>    The Boys approach. Linda tenses. At the last second the boys\n    make a hard left turn and disappear down the stairwell. It's\n    quiet again. Linda relaxes, smiles at her daughter. The F\n    TRAIN is rounding the final bend into the station.\n<b>\n<\/b>    Their focus is on this train. It's getting closer, louder.\n<b>\n<\/b>    And so they don't see, don't hear the Boys coming back up the\n    stairwell behind them.\n<b>\n<\/b>    Not until the boys have the mother and daughter boxed in and\n    the one who can hardly grow a mustache is showing them his\n    gun.\n<b>\n<\/b>    Linda puts her arm around her daughter. Alicia looks\n    terrified.\n<b>\n<\/b>    The train roars INTO THE STATION as Linda quickly hands over\n    her purse, her watch. She hands over her engagement ring and\n    her wedding band.\n<b>\n<\/b>    One of the boys yanks Alicia's little purse away from her.\n<b>\n<\/b>    The other boy fumbles the wedding band. The ring CLANGS to\n    the ground and rolls to a stop a few feet away.\n<b>\n<\/b>    We hear MEN'S VOICES echoing up the stairwell.\n<b>\n<\/b>    Now the Boys are boxed in. And starting to panic.\n<b>                                                                2.\n<\/b><b>\n<\/b><b>\n<\/b><b>    -- THE TRAIN DOORS SLIDE OPEN --.\n<\/b><b>\n<\/b>    The Boys see their way out and step into the last empty rail\n    car, leaving the mother and daughter alone on the platform.\n<b>\n<\/b>    Through the window on the train, Linda stares at the boy\n    holding her daughter's purse, her face hardening into a MASK\n<b>    OF CONTEMPT.\n<\/b><b>\n<\/b>    The boy clocks it. Who does she think she is?\n<b>\n<\/b><b>    -- THE TRAIN DOORS BEGIN TO CLOSE --\n<\/b><b>\n<\/b>    When a HAND WITH TATTOOED KNUCKLES reaches out and stops the\n    car doors from closing.\n<b>\n<\/b>    A forearm and gun extend out of that last subway car ...\n    There's a muzzle flash... a distant POP... a cloud of smoke\n    ... a mist of blood... and Linda's body collapses on itself.\n<b>\n<\/b>    Alicia's face, shock, terror and blood.\n<b>\n<\/b><b>\n<\/b><b>2   EXT. SMITH STREET STATION -- LATER THAT NIGHT --   M.O.S        2\n<\/b><b>\n<\/b>    A WORKING CRIME SCENE, lots of uniforms and light, a white\n    sheet draped over Linda's body where it fell.\n<b>\n<\/b>    BLUE AND RED LIGHT dances against the stairwell wall where a\n    man is taking the stairs two at a time. Late thirties, big,\n    plain clothes, he is SERGEANT JAMES CRAIG. When he reaches\n    the platform, he stops.\n<b>\n<\/b>    Craig kneels before the white sheet. Peels it back. We stay\n    on him. We don't see what he sees. We just see how he sees\n    it. Then he turns...\n<b>\n<\/b>    THE WEDDING BAND. It's been tagged and numbered as evidence.\n    Craig picks it right out of the chalk outline and slips it\n    into his pocket.\n<b>\n<\/b>    Alicia, wrapped in a blanket, standing next to a round police\n    MATRON. The Matron is tenderly trying to clean Alicia's face.\n    Alicia locks eyes with Craig and stumbles towards him, her\n    legs not quite working.\n<b>\n<\/b>    Craig saves her from the stumble and envelops her, lifting\n    her as the blanket falls to the ground.\n<b>\n<\/b>    Alicia makes little gasping noises. Trying to speak but\n    can't.\n<b>\n<\/b>    Craig walking back now, carrying his entire world. He reaches\n    the stairwell and suddenly falls to one knee. Alicia gasps.\n<b>                                                                3.\n<\/b><b>\n<\/b><b>\n<\/b>    The closest UNIFORM puts a hand on his arm. A moment.\n    Composure. A deep breath. Then as quickly as he went down,\n    he's back up.\n<b>\n<\/b>    Craig looks back now, taking it all in. Is it real? Sees all\n    the cops looking at him, then begins down the stairs.\n<b>\n<\/b>    WE DRIFT UP above the station until we find ourselves with a\n    clear view of the southern tip of Manhattan, where the TWIN\n<b>    TOWERS STAND TALL.\n<\/b><b>\n<\/b><b>\n<\/b><b>3   INT.

A GUITAR is on his lap. Tyler has propped some well\n    worn, hand written pages of MUSIC against a box of off-brand\n    laundry detergent and is squinting at the notes, frustration\n    etched in his face.\n<b>\n<\/b>    A forgettable BLONDE lies sleeping on the bed.\n<b>\n<\/b>    Tyler, not a born musician, is trying to teach himself one of\n    the PHRASES OF MUSIC in front of him. He is completely lost\n    in the moment, with DEEP GROOVES in his fingers. By the\n    ASHTRAY next to him, we can tell he's been at this a couple\n    of hours.\n<b>\n<\/b>    The Blonde in the bed re: the ringing phone...\n<b>\n<\/b><b>                        BLONDE\n<\/b>                  (out of it)\n              Hello?\n<b>\n<\/b>    Tyler gropes around the floor with one hand until he finds the\n    phone, simultaneously glancing at the digital clock.

From the trees and the sky we know its LATE\n    SPRING\/EARLY SUMMER. A gorgeous day.\n<b>\n<\/b>    Tyler gets out of the cab, holding the rim of his empty\n    coffee cup in his teeth. He sorts a rumpled wad of singles\n    and hands some to the driver, who screeches into reverse.\n    Time is money.\n<b>\n<\/b>    Tyler crushes the coffee cup flat and slips it in his jacket\n    pocket then lights up a smoke.
