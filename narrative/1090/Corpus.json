He constantly watches the other officers gamble, but never plays himself. One night, Tomsky tells a story about his grandmother, an elderly countess. Many years ago, in France, she lost a fortune at cards, and then won it back with the secret of the three winning cards, which she learned from the notorious Count of St. Germain. Hermann becomes obsessed with obtaining the secret.\nThe countess (who is now 87 years old) has a young ward, Lizavyeta Ivanovna. Hermann sends love letters to Lizavyeta, and persuades her to let him into the house. There Hermann accosts the countess, demanding the secret. She first tells him that story was a joke, but Hermann refuses to believe her. He repeats his demands, but she does not speak. He draws a pistol and threatens her, and the old lady dies of fright. Hermann then flees to the apartment of Lizavyeta in the same building. There he confesses to have killed the countess by fright with his pistol. He defends himself by saying that the pistol was not loaded. He escapes from the house with the aid of Lizavyeta, who is disgusted to learn that his professions of love were a mask for greed.\nHermann attends the funeral of the countess, and is terrified to see the countess open her eyes in the coffin and look at him. Later that night, the ghost of the countess appears. The ghost names the secret three cards (three, seven, ace), tells him he must play just once each night and then orders him to marry Lizavyeta. Hermann takes his entire savings to Chekalinsky's salon, where wealthy men gamble for high stakes. On the first night, he bets it all on the three and wins. On the second night, he wins on the seven. On the third night, he bets on the ace \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but when cards are shown, he finds he has bet on the Queen of Spades, rather than the ace, and loses everything. When the Queen appears to wink at him, he is astonished by her remarkable resemblance to the old countess, and flees in terror. In a short conclusion, Pushkin writes that Lizavyeta marries the son of the Countess' former steward, a state official who makes a good salary. Hermann, however, goes mad and is committed to an asylum. He is installed in Room 17 at the Obukhov hospital; he answers no questions, but merely mutters with unusual rapidity: \"Three, seven, ace!

Twitchell\n\nCopyright, 1901, by The Current Literature Publishing Company\n\n\nAT the house of Naroumov, a cavalry officer, the long winter night had\nbeen passed in gambling. At five in the morning breakfast was served\nto the weary players. The winners ate with relish; the losers, on the\ncontrary, pushed back their plates and sat brooding gloomily. Under\nthe influence of the good wine, however, the conversation then became\ngeneral.\n\n\"Well, Sourine?\" said the host inquiringly.\n\n\"Oh, I lost as usual. My luck is abominable. No matter how cool I keep,\nI never win.\"\n\n\"How is it, Herman, that you never touch a card?\" remarked one of the\nmen, addressing a young officer of the Engineering Corps. \"Here you are\nwith the rest of us at five o'clock in the morning, and you have neither\nplayed nor bet all night.\"\n\n\"Play interests me greatly,\" replied the person addressed, \"but I hardly\ncare to sacrifice the necessaries of life for uncertain superfluities.\"\n\n\"Herman is a German, therefore economical; that explains it,\" said\nTomsky. \"But the person I can't quite understand is my grandmother, the\nCountess Anna Fedorovna.\"\n\n\"Why?\" inquired a chorus of voices.\n\n\"I can't understand why my grandmother never gambles.\"\n\n\"I don't see anything very striking in the fact that a woman of eighty\nrefuses to gamble,\" objected Naroumov.\n\n\"Have you never heard her story?\"\n\n\"No--\"\n\n\"Well, then, listen to it. To begin with, sixty years ago my grandmother\nwent to Paris, where she was all the fashion. People crowded each other\nin the streets to get a chance to see the 'Muscovite Venus,' as she was\ncalled. All the great ladies played faro, then. On one occasion, while\nplaying with the Duke of Orleans, she lost an enormous sum. She told her\nhusband of the debt, but he refused outright to pay it. Nothing could\ninduce him to change his mind on the subject, and grandmother was at\nher wits' ends. Finally, she remembered a friend of hers, Count\nSaint-Germain. You must have heard of him, as many wonderful stories\nhave been told about him. He is said to have discovered the elixir of\nlife, the philosopher's stone, and many other equally marvelous things.\nHe had money at his disposal, and my grandmother knew it. She sent him a\nnote asking him to come to see her. He obeyed her summons and found her\nin great distress. She painted the cruelty of her husband in the darkest\ncolors, and ended by telling the Count that she depended upon his\nfriendship and generosity.\n\n\"'I could lend you the money,' replied the Count, after a moment of\nthoughtfulness, 'but I know that you would not enjoy a moment's rest\nuntil you had returned it; it would only add to your embarrassment.\nThere is another way of freeing yourself.'\n\n\"'But I have no money at all,' insisted my grandmother.\n\n\"'There is no need of money. Listen to me.'\n\n\"The Count then told her a secret which any of us would give a good deal\nto know.\"\n\nThe young gamesters were all attention. Tomsky lit his pipe, took a few\nwhiffs, then continued:\n\n\"The next evening, grandmother appeared at Versailles at the Queen's\ngaming-table. The Duke of Orleans was the dealer. Grandmother made some\nexcuse for not having brought any money, and began to punt. She chose\nthree cards in succession, again and again, winning every time, and was\nsoon out of debt.\"\n\n\"A fable,\" remarked Herman; \"perhaps the cards were marked.\"\n\n\"I hardly think so,\" replied Tomsky, with an air of importance.\n\n\"So you have a grandmother who knows three winning cards, and you\nhaven't found out the magic secret.\"\n\n\"I must say I have not. She had four sons, one of them being my father,\nall of whom are devoted to play; she never told the secret to one of\nthem. But my uncle told me this much, on his word of honor. Tchaplitzky,\nwho died in poverty after having squandered millions, lost at one time,\nat play, nearly three hundred thousand rubles. He was desperate and\ngrandmother took pity on him. She told him the three cards, making him\nswear never to use them again. He returned to the game, staked fifty\nthousand rubles on each card, and came out ahead, after paying his\ndebts.\"\n\nAs day was dawning the party now broke up, each one draining his glass\nand taking his leave.\n\nThe Countess Anna Fedorovna was seated before her mirror in her\ndressing-room. Three women were assisting at her toilet. The old\nCountess no longer made the slightest pretensions to beauty, but she\nstill clung to all the habits of her youth, and spent as much time at\nher toilet as she had done sixty years before. At the window a young\ngirl, her ward, sat at her needlework.\n\n\"Good afternoon, grandmother,\" cried a young officer, who had just\nentered the room. \"I have come to ask a favor of you.\"\n\n\"What, Pavel?\"\n\n\"I want to be allowed to present one of my friends to you, and to take\nyou to the ball on Tuesday night.\"\n\n\"Take me to the ball and present him to me there.\"\n\nAfter a few more remarks the officer walked up to the window where\nLisaveta Ivanovna sat.\n\n\"Whom do you wish to present?\" asked the girl.\n\n\"Naroumov; do you know him?\"\n\n\"No; is he a soldier?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"An engineer?\"\n\n\"No; why do you ask?\"\n\nThe girl smiled and made no reply.\n\nPavel Tomsky took his leave, and, left to herself, Lisaveta glanced\nout of the window. Soon, a young officer appeared at the corner of the\nstreet; the girl blushed and bent her head low over her canvas.\n\nThis appearance of the officer had become a daily occurrence. The man\nwas totally unknown to her, and as she was not accustomed to coquetting\nwith the soldiers she saw on the street, she hardly knew how to explain\nhis presence. His persistence finally roused an interest entirely\nstrange to her. One day, she even ventured to smile upon her admirer,\nfor such he seemed to be.\n\nThe reader need hardly be told that the officer was no other than\nHerman, the would-be gambler, whose imagination had been strongly\nexcited by the story told by Tomsky of the three magic cards.\n\n\"Ah,\" he thought, \"if the old Countess would only reveal the secret to\nme. Why not try to win her good-will and appeal to her sympathy?\"\n\nWith this idea in mind, he took up his daily station before the house,\nwatching the pretty face at the window, and trusting to fate to bring\nabout the desired acquaintance.\n\nOne day, as Lisaveta was standing on the pavement about to enter the\ncarriage after the Countess, she felt herself jostled and a note was\nthrust into her hand. Turning, she saw the young officer at her elbow.\nAs quick as thought, she put the note in her glove and entered the\ncarriage. On her return from the drive, she hastened to her chamber to\nread the missive, in a state of excitement mingled with fear. It was\na tender and respectful declaration of affection, copied word for word\nfrom a German novel. Of this fact, Lisa was, of course, ignorant.\n\nThe young girl was much impressed by the missive, but she felt that\nthe writer must not be encouraged. She therefore wrote a few lines of\nexplanation and, at the first opportunity, dropped it, with the letter,\nout of the window. The officer hastily crossed the street, picked up the\npapers and entered a shop to read them.\n\nIn no wise daunted by this rebuff, he found the opportunity to send\nher another note in a few days. He received no reply, but, evidently\nunderstanding the female heart, he presevered, begging for an interview.\nHe was rewarded at last by the following:\n\n\"To-night we go to the ambassador's ball. We shall remain until two\no'clock. I can arrange for a meeting in this way. After our departure,\nthe servants will probably all go out, or go to sleep. At half-past\neleven enter the vestibule boldly, and if you see any one, inquire for\nthe Countess; if not, ascend the stairs, turn to the left and go on\nuntil you come to a door, which opens into her bedchamber. Enter\nthis room and behind a screen you will find another door leading to a\ncorridor; from this a spiral staircase leads to my sitting-room. I shall\nexpect to find you there on my return.\"\n\nHerman trembled like a leaf as the appointed hour drew near. He obeyed\ninstructions fully, and, as he met no one, he reached the old lady's\nbedchamber without difficulty. Instead of going out of the small door\nbehind the screen, however, he concealed himself in a closet to await\nthe return of the old Countess.\n\nThe hours dragged slowly by; at last he heard the sound of wheels.\nImmediately lamps were lighted and servants began moving about. Finally\nthe old woman tottered into the room, completely exhausted. Her women\nremoved her wraps and proceeded to get her in readiness for the night.\nHerman watched the proceedings with a curiosity not unmingled with\nsuperstitious fear. When at last she was attired in cap and gown, the\nold woman looked less uncanny than when she wore her ball-dress of blue\nbrocade.\n\nShe sat down in an easy chair beside a table, as she was in the habit\nof doing before retiring, and her women withdrew. As the old lady sat\nswaying to and fro, seemingly oblivious to her surroundings, Herman\ncrept out of his hiding-place.\n\nAt the slight noise the old woman opened her eyes, and gazed at the\nintruder with a half-dazed expression.\n\n\"Have no fear, I beg of you,\" said Herman, in a calm voice. \"I have not\ncome to harm you, but to ask a favor of you instead.\"\n\nThe Countess looked at him in silence, seemingly without comprehending\nhim. Herman thought she might be deaf, so he put his lips close to her\near and repeated his remark. The listener remained perfectly mute.\n\n\"You could make my fortune without its costing you anything,\" pleaded\nthe young man; \"only tell me the three cards which are sure to win,\nand--\"\n\nHerman paused as the old woman opened her lips as if about to speak.\n\n\"It was only a jest; I swear to you, it was only a jest,\" came from the\nwithered lips.\n\n\"There was no jesting about it. Remember Tchaplitzky, who, thanks to\nyou, was able to pay his debts.\"\n\nAn expression of interior agitation passed over the face of the old\nwoman; then she relapsed into her former apathy.\n\n\"Will you tell me the names of the magic cards, or not?\" asked Herman\nafter a pause.\n\nThere was no reply.\n\nThe young man then drew a pistol from his pocket, exclaiming: \"You old\nwitch, I'll force you to tell me!\"\n\nAt the sight of the weapon the Countess gave a second sign of life. She\nthrew back her head and put out her hands as if to protect herself; then\nthey dropped and she sat motionless.\n\nHerman grasped her arm roughly, and was about to renew his threats, when\nhe saw that she was dead!\n\n*****\n\nSeated in her room, still in her ball-dress, Lisaveta gave herself up to\nher reflections. She had expected to find the young officer there, but\nshe felt relieved to see that he was not.\n\nStrangely enough, that very night at the ball, Tomsky had rallied her\nabout her preference for the young officer, assuring her that he knew\nmore than she supposed he did.\n\n\"Of whom are you speaking?\" she had asked in alarm, fearing her\nadventure had been discovered.\n\n\"Of the remarkable man,\" was the reply. \"His name is Herman.\"\n\nLisa made no reply.\n\n\"This Herman,\" continued Tomsky, \"is a romantic character; he has the\nprofile of a Napoleon and the heart of a Mephistopheles. It is said he\nhas at least three crimes on his conscience. But how pale you are.\"\n\n\"It is only a slight headache. But why do you talk to me of this\nHerman?\"\n\n\"Because I believe he has serious intentions concerning you.\"\n\n\"Where has he seen me?\"\n\n\"At church, perhaps, or on the street.\"\n\nThe conversation was interrupted at this point, to the great regret of\nthe young girl. The words of Tomsky made a deep impression upon her, and\nshe realized how imprudently she had acted. She was thinking of all this\nand a great deal more when the door of her apartment suddenly opened,\nand Herman stood before her. She drew back at sight of him, trembling\nviolently.\n\n\"Where have you been?\" she asked in a frightened whisper.\n\n\"In the bedchamber of the Countess. She is dead,\" was the calm reply.\n\n\"My God! What are you saying?\" cried the girl.\n\n\"Furthermore, I believe that I was the cause of her death.\"\n\nThe words of Tomsky flashed through Lisa's mind.\n\nHerman sat down and told her all. She listened with a feeling of terror\nand disgust. So those passionate letters, that audacious pursuit were\nnot the result of tenderness and love. It was money that he desired. The\npoor girl felt that she had in a sense been an accomplice in the death\nof her benefactress. She began to weep bitterly. Herman regarded her in\nsilence.\n\n\"You are a monster!\" exclaimed Lisa, drying her eyes.\n\n\"I didn't intend to kill her; the pistol was not even loaded.\n\n\"How are you going to get out of the house?\" inquired Lisa. \"It is\nnearly daylight. I intended to show you the way to a secret staircase,\nwhile the Countess was asleep, as we would have to cross her chamber.\nNow I am afraid to do so.\"\n\n\"Direct me, and I will find the way alone,\" replied Herman.\n\nShe gave him minute instructions and a key with which to open the street\ndoor. The young man pressed the cold, inert hand, then went out.\n\nThe death of the Countess had surprised no one, as it had long been\nexpected. Her funeral was attended by every one of note in the\nvicinity. Herman mingled with the throng without attracting any especial\nattention. After all the friends had taken their last look at the dead\nface, the young man approached the bier. He prostrated himself on the\ncold floor, and remained motionless for a long time. He rose at last\nwith a face almost as pale as that of the corpse itself, and went up the\nsteps to look into the casket. As he looked down it seemed to him that\nthe rigid face returned his glance mockingly, closing one eye. He turned\nabruptly away, made a false step, and fell to the floor. He was picked\nup, and, at the same moment, Lisaveta was carried out in a faint.\n\nHerman did not recover his usual composure during the entire day. He\ndined alone at an out-of-the-way restaurant, and drank a great deal, in\nthe hope of stifling his emotion. The wine only served to stimulate his\nimagination. He returned home and threw himself down on his bed without\nundressing.\n\nDuring the night he awoke with a start; the moon shone into his chamber,\nmaking everything plainly visible. Some one looked in at the window,\nthen quickly disappeared. He paid no attention to this, but soon he\nheard the vestibule door open. He thought it was his orderly, returning\nlate, drunk as usual. The step was an unfamiliar one, and he heard the\nshuffling sound of loose slippers.\n\nThe door of his room opened, and a woman in white entered. She came\nclose to the bed, and the terrified man recognized the Countess.\n\n\"I have come to you against my will,\" she said abruptly; \"but I was\ncommanded to grant your request. The tray, seven, and ace in succession\nare the magic cards. Twenty-four hours must elapse between the use\nof each card, and after the three have been used you must never play\nagain.\"\n\nThe fantom then turned and walked away. Herman heard the outside door\nclose, and again saw the form pass the window.\n\nHe rose and went out into the hall, where his orderly lay asleep on the\nfloor. The door was closed. Finding no trace of a visitor, he returned\nto his room, lit his candle, and wrote down what he had just heard.\n\nTwo fixed ideas cannot exist in the brain at the same time any more than\ntwo bodies can occupy the same point in space. The tray, seven, and ace\nsoon chased away the thoughts of the dead woman, and all other thoughts\nfrom the brain of the young officer. All his ideas merged into a single\none: how to turn to advantage the secret paid for so dearly. He even\nthought of resigning his commission and going to Paris to force a\nfortune from conquered fate. Chance rescued him from his embarrassment.\n\n*****\n\nTchekalinsky, a man who had passed his whole life at cards, opened\na club at St. Petersburg. His long experience secured for him the\nconfidence of his companions, and his hospitality and genial humor\nconciliated society.\n\nThe gilded youth flocked around him, neglecting society, preferring the\ncharms of faro to those of their sweethearts. Naroumov invited Herman\nto accompany him to the club, and the young man accepted the invitation\nonly too willingly.\n\nThe two officers found the apartments full. Generals and statesmen\nplayed whist; young men lounged on sofas, eating ices or smoking. In\nthe principal salon stood a long table, at which about twenty men sat\nplaying faro, the host of the establishment being the banker.\n\nHe was a man of about sixty, gray-haired and respectable. His ruddy face\nshone with genial humor; his eyes sparkled and a constant smile hovered\naround his lips.\n\nNaroumov presented Herman. The host gave him a cordial handshake, begged\nhim not to stand upon ceremony, and returned, to his dealing. More than\nthirty cards were already on the table. Tchekalinsky paused after each\ncoup, to allow the punters time to recognize their gains or losses,\npolitely answering all questions and constantly smiling.\n\nAfter the deal was over, the cards were shuffled and the game began\nagain.\n\n\"Permit me to choose a card,\" said Herman, stretching out his hand over\nthe head of a portly gentleman, to reach a livret. The banker bowed\nwithout replying.\n\nHerman chose a card, and wrote the amount of his stake upon it with a\npiece of chalk.\n\n\"How much is that?\" asked the banker; \"excuse me, sir, but I do not see\nwell.\"\n\n\"Forty thousand rubles,\" said Herman coolly.\n\nAll eyes were instantly turned upon the speaker.\n\n\"He has lost his wits,\" thought Naroumov.\n\n\"Allow me to observe,\" said Tchekalinsky, with his eternal smile, \"that\nyour stake is excessive.\"\n\n\"What of it?\" replied Herman, nettled. \"Do you accept it or not?\"\n\nThe banker nodded in assent. \"I have only to remind you that the cash\nwill be necessary; of course your word is good, but in order to keep the\nconfidence of my patrons, I prefer the ready money.\"\n\nHerman took a bank-check from his pocket and handed it to his host. The\nlatter examined it attentively, then laid it on the card chosen.\n\nHe began dealing: to the right, a nine; to the left, a tray.\n\n\"The tray wins,\" said Herman, showing the card he held--a tray.\n\nA murmur ran through the crowd. Tchekalinsky frowned for a second only,\nthen his smile returned. He took a roll of bank-bills from his pocket\nand counted out the required sum. Herman received it and at once left\nthe table.\n\nThe next evening saw him at the place again. Every one eyed him\ncuriously, and Tchekalinsky greeted him cordially.\n\nHe selected his card and placed upon it his fresh stake. The banker\nbegan dealing: to the right, a nine; to the left, a seven.\n\nHerman then showed his card--a seven spot. The onlookers exclaimed,\nand the host was visibly disturbed. He counted out ninety-four-thousand\nrubles and passed them to Herman, who accepted them without showing the\nleast surprise, and at once withdrew.\n\nThe following evening he went again. His appearance was the signal for\nthe cessation of all occupation, every one being eager to watch the\ndevelopments of events. He selected his card--an ace.\n\nThe dealing began: to the right, a queen; to the left, an ace.\n\n\"The ace wins,\" remarked Herman, turning up his card without glancing at\nit.\n\n\"Your queen is killed,\" remarked Tchekalinsky quietly.\n\nHerman trembled; looking down, he saw, not the ace he had selected,\nbut the queen of spades. He could scarcely believe his eyes. It seemed\nimpossible that he could have made such a mistake. As he stared at the\ncard it seemed to him that the queen winked one eye at him mockingly.\n\n\"The old woman!\" he exclaimed involuntarily.\n\nThe croupier raked in the money while he looked on in stupid terror.\nWhen he left the table, all made way for him to pass; the cards were\nshuffled, and the gambling went on.\n\nHerman became a lunatic. He was confined at the hospital at Oboukov,\nwhere he spoke to no one, but kept constantly murmuring in a monotonous\ntone: \"The tray, seven, ace! The tray, seven, queen!\"\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Queen Of Spades, by \nAlexander Sergeievitch Poushkin\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE QUEEN OF SPADES ***\n\n***** This file should be named 23058.txt or 23058.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/3\/0\/5\/23058\/\n\nProduced by David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1090,"split":"train"}
