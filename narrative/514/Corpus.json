A lord has assaulted a \"gentle belle\" (line 8), causing her to reject him. He then proceeds to tell the story of this offence.\nWhile Belinda is still asleep, her guardian Sylph Ariel forewarns her that \"some dread event impends\". Belinda then awakes and gets ready for the day with the help of her maid, Betty. The Sylphs, though unseen, also contribute: \"These set the head, and those divide the hair, some fold the sleeve, whilst others plait the gown\" (146\u00e2\u0080\u0093147). Here Pope also describes Belinda's two locks of hair \"which graceful hung behind\". The Baron, one of Belinda's suitors, greatly admires these locks and conspires to steal one. Building an altar, he places on it \"all the trophies of his former loves\" (line 40), sets them on fire and fervently prays \"soon to obtain, and long possess\" (line 44) the lock.\nAriel, disturbed by the impending event although not knowing what it will be, summons many sylphs to him and instructs them to guard Belinda from anything that may befall her, whether she \"forget her prayers, or miss a masquerade, Or lost her heart, or necklace, at a ball\" (line 108\u00e2\u0080\u0093109). So protected, Belinda arrives at Hampton Court and is invited to play a game of ombre.\nThe conspiring Baron acquires a pair of scissors and tries to snip off one of her locks but is prevented by the watchful Sylphs. This happens three times, but in the end the Baron succeeds (also cutting a Sylph in two although Pope reassures us, parodying a passage in Paradise Lost, that \"airy substance soon unites again\" [line 152]). When Belinda discovers her lock is gone, she falls into a tantrum, while the Baron celebrates his victory.\nA gnome named Umbriel now journeys to the Cave of Spleen and from the Queen receives a bag of \"sighs, sobs, and passions, and the war of tongues\" (canto 4 line 84) and a vial filled \"with fainting fears, soft sorrows, melting griefs, and flowing tears\" (line 85\u00e2\u0080\u009386) and brings them to Belinda. Finding her dejected in the arms of the woman Thalestris, he pours the contents over them both.\nMany people, moved by Belinda's grief, demand the lock back, but the Baron is unrepentant and refuses. Clarissa admonishes them to keep their good humour, but they will not listen and instead a court battle ensues between the nobles, with glares, songs and wits as weapons. Belinda fights with the Baron and throws snuff up his nose to subdue him. When she demands that he restore the lock, however, it is nowhere to be found. It has been made a constellation and is destined to outlast the contestants.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfProject Gutenberg's The Rape of the Lock and Other Poems, by Alexander Pope\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

With this purpose he has included in\naddition to 'The Rape of the Lock', the 'Essay on Criticism' as\nfurnishing the standard by which Pope himself expected his work to be\njudged, the 'First Epistle' of the 'Essay on Man' as a characteristic\nexample of his didactic poetry, and the 'Epistle to Arbuthnot', both for\nits exhibition of Pope's genius as a satirist and for the picture it\ngives of the poet himself. To these are added the famous close of the\n'Dunciad', the 'Ode to Solitude', a specimen of Pope's infrequent lyric\nnote, and the 'Epitaph on Gay'.\n\nThe first edition of 'The Rape of the Lock' has been given as an\nappendix in order that the student may have the opportunity of comparing\nthe two forms of this poem, and of realizing the admirable art with\nwhich Pope blended old and new in the version that is now the only one\nknown to the average reader. The text throughout is that of the Globe\nEdition prepared by Professor A. W. Ward.\n\nThe editor can lay no claim to originality in the notes with which he\nhas attempted to explain and illustrate these poems. He is indebted at\nevery step to the labors of earlier editors, particularly to Elwin,\nCourthope, Pattison, and Hales. If he has added anything of his own, it\nhas been in the way of defining certain words whose meaning or\nconnotation has changed since the time of Pope, and in paraphrasing\ncertain passages to bring out a meaning which has been partially\nobscured by the poet's effort after brevity and concision.\n\nIn the general introduction the editor has aimed not so much to recite\nthe facts of Pope's life as to draw the portrait of a man whom he\nbelieves to have been too often misunderstood and misrepresented. The\nspecial introductions to the various poems are intended to acquaint the\nstudent with the circumstances under which they were composed, to trace\ntheir literary genesis and relationships, and, whenever necessary, to\ngive an outline of the train of thought which they embody.\n\nIn conclusion the editor would express the hope that his labors in the\npreparation of this book may help, if only in some slight degree, to\nstimulate the study of the work of a poet who, with all his limitations,\nremains one of the abiding glories of English literature, and may\ncontribute not less to a proper appreciation of a man who with all his\nfaults was, on the evidence of those who knew him best, not only a great\npoet, but a very human and lovable personality.\n\nT.

Accepted almost\non his first appearance as one of the leading poets of the day, he\nrapidly became recognized as the foremost man of letters of his age. He\nheld this position throughout his life, and for over half a century\nafter his death his works were considered not only as masterpieces, but\nas the finest models of poetry. With the change of poetic temper that\noccurred at the beginning of the nineteenth century Pope's fame was\novershadowed. The romantic poets and critics even raised the question\nwhether Pope was a poet at all. And as his poetical fame diminished, the\nharsh judgments of his personal character increased. It is almost\nincredible with what exulting bitterness critics and editors of Pope\nhave tracked out and exposed his petty intrigues, exaggerated his\ndelinquencies, misrepresented his actions, attempted in short to blast\nhis character as a man.\n\nBoth as a man and as a poet Pope is sadly in need of a defender to-day.\nAnd a defense is by no means impossible. The depreciation of Pope's\npoetry springs, in the main, from an attempt to measure it by other\nstandards than those which he and his age recognized. The attacks upon\nhis character are due, in large measure, to a misunderstanding of the\nspirit of the times in which he lived and to a forgetfulness of the\nspecial circumstances of his own life. Tried in a fair court by\nimpartial judges Pope as a poet would be awarded a place, if not among\nthe noblest singers, at least high among poets of the second order. And\nthe flaws of character which even his warmest apologist must admit would\non the one hand be explained, if not excused, by circumstances, and on\nthe other more than counterbalanced by the existence of noble qualities\nto which his assailants seem to have been quite blind.\n\nAlexander Pope was born in London on May 21, 1688. His father was a\nRoman Catholic linen draper, who had married a second time. Pope was the\nonly child of this marriage, and seems to have been a delicate,\nsweet-tempered, precocious, and, perhaps, a rather spoiled child.\n\nPope's religion and his chronic ill-health are two facts of the highest\nimportance to be taken into consideration in any study of his life or\njudgment of his character. The high hopes of the Catholics for a\nrestoration of their religion had been totally destroyed by the\nRevolution of 1688. During all Pope's lifetime they were a sect at once\nfeared, hated, and oppressed by the severest laws. They were excluded\nfrom the schools and universities, they were burdened with double taxes,\nand forbidden to acquire real estate. All public careers were closed to\nthem, and their property and even their persons were in times of\nexcitement at the mercy of informers. In the last year of Pope's life a\nproclamation was issued forbidding Catholics to come within ten miles of\nLondon, and Pope himself, in spite of his influential friends, thought\nit wise to comply with this edict. A fierce outburst of persecution\noften evokes in the persecuted some of the noblest qualities of human\nnature; but a long-continued and crushing tyranny that extends to all\nthe details of daily life is only too likely to have the most\nunfortunate results on those who are subjected to it. And as a matter of\nfact we find that the well-to-do Catholics of Pope's day lived in an\natmosphere of disaffection, political intrigue, and evasion of the law,\nmost unfavorable for the development of that frank, courageous, and\npatriotic spirit for the lack of which Pope himself has so often been\nmade the object of reproach.\n\nIn a well-known passage of the 'Epistle to Arbuthnot', Pope has spoken\nof his life as one long disease. He was in fact a humpbacked dwarf, not\nover four feet six inches in height, with long, spider-like legs and\narms. He was subject to violent headaches, and his face was lined and\ncontracted with the marks of suffering. In youth he so completely ruined\nhis health by perpetual studies that his life was despaired of, and only\nthe most careful treatment saved him from an early death. Toward the\nclose of his life he became so weak that he could neither dress nor\nundress without assistance. He had to be laced up in stiff stays in\norder to sit erect, and wore a fur doublet and three pairs of stockings\nto protect himself against the cold. With these physical defects he had\nthe extreme sensitiveness of mind that usually accompanies chronic ill\nhealth, and this sensitiveness was outraged incessantly by the brutal\ncustoms of the age. Pope's enemies made as free with his person as with\nhis poetry, and there is little doubt that he felt the former attacks\nthe more bitterly of the two. Dennis, his first critic, called him \"a\nshort squab gentleman, the very bow of the God of love; his outward form\nis downright monkey.\" A rival poet whom he had offended hung up a rod in\na coffee house where men of letters resorted, and threatened to whip\nPope like a naughty child if he showed his face there. It is said,\nthough perhaps not on the best authority, that when Pope once forgot\nhimself so far as to make love to Lady Mary Wortley Montague, the lady's\nanswer was \"a fit of immoderate laughter.\" In an appendix to the\n'Dunciad' Pope collected some of the epithets with which his enemies had\npelted him, \"an ape,\" \"an ass,\" \"a frog,\" \"a coward,\" \"a fool,\" \"a\nlittle abject thing.\" He affected, indeed, to despise his assailants,\nbut there is only too good evidence that their poisoned arrows rankled\nin his heart. Richardson, the painter, found him one day reading the\nlatest abusive pamphlet. \"These things are my diversion,\" said the poet,\nstriving to put the best face on it; but as he read, his friends saw his\nfeatures \"writhen with anguish,\" and prayed to be delivered from all\nsuch \"diversions\" as these. Pope's enemies and their savage abuse are\nmostly forgotten to-day. Pope's furious retorts have been secured to\nimmortality by his genius. It would have been nobler, no doubt, to have\nanswered by silence only; but before one condemns Pope it is only fair\nto realize the causes of his bitterness.\n\nPope's education was short and irregular. He was taught the rudiments of\nLatin and Greek by his family priest, attended for a brief period a\nschool in the country and another in London, and at the early age of\ntwelve left school altogether, and settling down at his father's house\nin the country began to read to his heart's delight. He roamed through\nthe classic poets, translating passages that pleased him, went up for a\ntime to London to get lessons in French and Italian, and above all read\nwith eagerness and attention the works of older English poets,--Spenser,\nWaller, and Dryden. He had already, it would seem, determined to become\na poet, and his father, delighted with the clever boy's talent, used to\nset him topics, force him to correct his verses over and over, and\nfinally, when satisfied, dismiss him with the praise, \"These are good\nrhymes.\" He wrote a comedy, a tragedy, an epic poem, all of which he\nafterward destroyed and, as he laughingly confessed in later years, he\nthought himself \"the greatest genius that ever was.\"\n\nPope was not alone, however, in holding a high opinion of his talents.\nWhile still a boy in his teens he was taken up and patronized by a\nnumber of gentlemen, Trumbull, Walsh, and Cromwell, all dabblers in\npoetry and criticism. He was introduced to the dramatist Wycherly,\nnearly fifty years his senior, and helped to polish some of the old\nman's verses. His own works were passed about in manuscript from hand to\nhand till one of them came to the eyes of Dryden's old publisher,\nTonson. Tonson wrote Pope a respectful letter asking for the honor of\nbeing allowed to publish them. One may fancy the delight with which the\nsixteen-year-old boy received this offer. It is a proof of Pope's\npatience as well as his precocity that he delayed three years before\naccepting it. It was not till 1709 that his first published verses, the\n'Pastorals', a fragment translated from Homer, and a modernized version\nof one of the 'Canterbury Tales', appeared in Tonson's 'Miscellany'.\n\nWith the publication of the 'Pastorals', Pope embarked upon his life as\na man of letters. They seem to have brought him a certain recognition,\nbut hardly fame. That he obtained by his next poem, the 'Essay on\nCriticism', which appeared in 1711. It was applauded in the 'Spectator',\nand Pope seems about this time to have made the acquaintance of Addison\nand the little senate which met in Button's coffee house. His poem the\n'Messiah' appeared in the 'Spectator' in May 1712; the first draft of\n'The Rape of the Lock' in a poetical miscellany in the same year, and\nAddison's request, in 1713, that he compose a prologue for the tragedy\nof 'Cato' set the final stamp upon his rank as a poet.\n\nPope's friendly relations with Addison and his circle were not, however,\nlong continued. In the year 1713 he gradually drew away from them and\ncame under the influence of Swift, then at the height of his power in\npolitical and social life. Swift introduced him to the brilliant Tories,\npoliticians and lovers of letters, Harley, Bolingbroke, and Atterbury,\nwho were then at the head of affairs. Pope's new friends seem to have\ntreated him with a deference which he had never experienced before, and\nwhich bound him to them in unbroken affection. Harley used to regret\nthat Pope's religion rendered him legally incapable of holding a\nsinecure office in the government, such as was frequently bestowed in\nthose days upon men of letters, and Swift jestingly offered the young\npoet twenty guineas to become a Protestant. But now, as later, Pope was\nfirmly resolved not to abandon the faith of his parents for the sake of\nworldly advantage. And in order to secure the independence he valued so\nhighly he resolved to embark upon the great work of his life, the\ntranslation of Homer.\n\n\"What led me into that,\" he told a friend long after, \"was purely the\nwant of money. I had then none; not even to buy books.\" It seems that\nabout this time, 1713, Pope's father had experienced some heavy\nfinancial losses, and the poet, whose receipts in money had so far been\nby no means in proportion to the reputation his works had brought him,\nnow resolved to use that reputation as a means of securing from the\npublic a sum which would at least keep him for life from poverty or the\nnecessity of begging for patronage. It is worth noting that Pope was the\nfirst Englishman of letters who threw himself thus boldly upon the\npublic and earned his living by his pen.\n\nThe arrangements for the publication and sale of Pope's translation of\nHomer were made with care and pushed on with enthusiasm. He issued in\n1713 his proposals for an edition to be published by subscription, and\nhis friends at once became enthusiastic canvassers. We have a\ncharacteristic picture of Swift at this time, bustling about a crowded\nante-chamber, and informing the company that the best poet in England\nwas Mr. Pope (a Papist) who had begun a translation of Homer for which\nthey must all subscribe, \"for,\" says he, \"the author shall not begin to\nprint till I have a thousand guineas for him.\" The work was to be in six\nvolumes, each costing a guinea. Pope obtained 575 subscribers, many of\nwhom took more than one set. Lintot, the publisher, gave Pope \u00c2\u00a31200 for\nthe work and agreed to supply the subscription copies free of charge. As\na result Pope made something between \u00c2\u00a35000 and \u00c2\u00a36000, a sum absolutely\nunprecedented in the history of English literature, and amply sufficient\nto make him independent for life.\n\nBut the sum was honestly earned by hard and wearisome work. Pope was no\nGreek scholar; it is said, indeed, that he was just able to make out the\nsense of the original with a translation. And in addition to the fifteen\nthousand lines of the 'Iliad', he had engaged to furnish an introduction\nand notes. At first the magnitude of the undertaking frightened him.\n\"What terrible moments,\" he said to Spence, \"does one feel after one has\nengaged for a large work. In the beginning of my translating the\n'Iliad', I wished anybody would hang me a hundred times. It sat so\nheavily on my mind at first that I often used to dream of it and do\nsometimes still.\" In spite of his discouragement, however, and of the\nill health which so constantly beset him, Pope fell gallantly upon his\ntask, and as time went on came almost to enjoy it. He used to translate\nthirty or forty verses in the morning before rising and, in his own\ncharacteristic phrase, \"piddled over them for the rest of the day.\" He\nused every assistance possible, drew freely upon the scholarship of\nfriends, corrected and recorrected with a view to obtaining clearness\nand point, and finally succeeded in producing a version which not only\nsatisfied his own critical judgment, but was at once accepted by the\nEnglish-speaking world as the standard translation of Homer.\n\nThe first volume came out in June, 1715, and to Pope's dismay and wrath\na rival translation appeared almost simultaneously. Tickell, one of\nAddison's \"little senate,\" had also begun a translation of the 'Iliad',\nand although he announced in the preface that he intended to withdraw in\nfavor of Pope and take up a translation of the 'Odyssey', the poet's\nsuspicions were at once aroused. And they were quickly fanned into a\nflame by the gossip of the town which reported that Addison, the\nrecognized authority in literary criticism, pronounced Tickell's version\n\"the best that ever was in any language.\" Rumor went so far, in fact, as\nto hint pretty broadly that Addison himself was the author, in part, at\nleast, of Tickell's book; and Pope, who had been encouraged by Addison\nto begin his long task, felt at once that he had been betrayed. His\nresentment was all the more bitter since he fancied that Addison, now at\nthe height of his power and prosperity in the world of letters and of\npolitics, had attempted to ruin an enterprise on which the younger man\nhad set all his hopes of success and independence, for no better reason\nthan literary jealousy and political estrangement. We know now that Pope\nwas mistaken, but there was beyond question some reason at the time for\nhis thinking as he did, and it is to the bitterness which this incident\ncaused in his mind that we owe the famous satiric portrait of Addison as\nAtticus.\n\nThe last volume of the 'Iliad' appeared in the spring of 1720, and in it\nPope gave a renewed proof of his independence by dedicating the whole\nwork, not to some lord who would have rewarded him with a handsome\npresent, but to his old acquaintance, Congreve, the last survivor of the\nbrilliant comic dramatists of Dryden's day. And now resting for a time\nfrom his long labors, Pope turned to the adornment and cultivation of\nthe little house and garden that he had leased at Twickenham.\n\nPope's father had died in 1717, and the poet, rejecting politely but\nfirmly the suggestion of his friend, Atterbury, that he might now turn\nProtestant, devoted himself with double tenderness to the care of his\naged and infirm mother. He brought her with him to Twickenham, where she\nlived till 1733, dying in that year at the great age of ninety-one. It\nmay have been partly on her account that Pope pitched upon Twickenham as\nhis abiding place. Beautifully situated on the banks of the Thames, it\nwas at once a quiet country place and yet of easy access to London, to\nHampton Court, or to Kew. The five acres of land that lay about the\nhouse furnished Pope with inexhaustible entertainment for the rest of\nhis life. He \"twisted and twirled and harmonized\" his bit of ground\n\"till it appeared two or three sweet little lawns opening and opening\nbeyond one another, the whole surrounded by impenetrable woods.\"\nFollowing the taste of his times in landscape gardening, he adorned his\nlawns with artificial mounds, a shell temple, an obelisk, and a\ncolonnade. But the crowning glory was the grotto, a tunnel decorated\nfantastically with shells and bits of looking-glass, which Pope dug\nunder a road that ran through his grounds. Here Pope received in state,\nand his house and garden was for years the center of the most brilliant\nsociety in England. Here Swift came on his rare visits from Ireland, and\nBolingbroke on his return from exile. Arbuthnot, Pope's beloved\nphysician, was a frequent visitor, and Peterborough, one of the most\ndistinguished of English soldiers, condescended to help lay out the\ngarden. Congreve came too, at times, and Gay, the laziest and most\ngood-natured of poets. Nor was the society of women lacking at these\ngatherings. Lady Mary Wortley Montague, the wittiest woman in England,\nwas often there, until her bitter quarrel with the poet; the grim old\nDuchess of Marlborough appeared once or twice in Pope's last years; and\nthe Princess of Wales came with her husband to inspire the leaders of\nthe opposition to the hated Walpole and the miserly king. And from first\nto last, the good angel of the place was the blue-eyed, sweet-tempered\nPatty Blount, Pope's best and dearest friend.\n\nNot long after the completion of the 'Iliad', Pope undertook to edit\nShakespeare, and completed the work in 1724. The edition is, of course,\nquite superseded now, but it has its place in the history of\nShakespearean studies as the first that made an effort, though irregular\nand incomplete, to restore the true text by collation and conjecture. It\nhas its place, too, in the story of Pope's life, since the bitter\ncriticism which it received, all the more unpleasant to the poet since\nit was in the main true, was one of the principal causes of his writing\nthe 'Dunciad'. Between the publication of his edition of Shakespeare,\nhowever, and the appearance of the 'Dunciad', Pope resolved to complete\nhis translation of Homer, and with the assistance of a pair of friends,\ngot out a version of the Odyssey in 1725. Like the 'Iliad', this was\npublished by subscription, and as in the former case the greatest men in\nEngland were eager to show their appreciation of the poet by filling up\nhis lists. Sir Robert Walpole, the great Whig statesman, took ten\ncopies, and Harley, the fallen Tory leader, put himself, his wife, and\nhis daughter down for sixteen. Pope made, it is said, about \u00c2\u00a33700 by\nthis work.\n\nIn 1726, Swift visited Pope and encouraged him to complete a satire\nwhich he seems already to have begun on the dull critics and hack\nwriters of the day. For one cause or another its publication was\ndeferred until 1728, when it appeared under the title of the 'Dunciad'.\nHere Pope declared open war upon his enemies. All those who had attacked\nhis works, abused his character, or scoffed at his personal deformities,\nwere caricatured as ridiculous and sometimes disgusting figures in a\nmock epic poem celebrating the accession of a new monarch to the throne\nof Dullness. The 'Dunciad' is little read to-day except by professed\nstudents of English letters, but it made, naturally enough, a great stir\nat the time and vastly provoked the wrath of all the dunces whose names\nit dragged to light. Pope has often been blamed for stooping to such\nignoble combat, and in particular for the coarseness of his abuse, and\nfor his bitter jests upon the poverty of his opponents. But it must be\nremembered that no living writer had been so scandalously abused as\nPope, and no writer that ever lived was by nature so quick to feel and\nto resent insult. The undoubted coarseness of the work is in part due to\nthe gross license of the times in speech and writing, and more\nparticularly to the influence of Swift, at this time predominant over\nPope. And in regard to Pope's trick of taunting his enemies with\npoverty, it must frankly be confessed that he seized upon this charge as\na ready and telling weapon. Pope was at heart one of the most charitable\nof men. In the days of his prosperity he is said to have given away one\neighth of his income. And he was always quick to succor merit in\ndistress; he pensioned the poet Savage and he tried to secure patronage\nfor Johnson. But for the wretched hack writers of the common press who\nhad barked against him he had no mercy, and he struck them with the\nfirst rod that lay ready to his hands.\n\nDuring his work on the 'Dunciad', Pope came into intimate relations with\nBolingbroke, who in 1725 had returned from his long exile in France and\nhad settled at Dawley within easy reach of Pope's villa at Twickenham.\nBolingbroke was beyond doubt one of the most brilliant and stimulating\nminds of his age. Without depth of intellect or solidity of character,\nhe was at once a philosopher, a statesman, a scholar, and a fascinating\ntalker. Pope, who had already made his acquaintance, was delighted to\nrenew and improve their intimacy, and soon came wholly under the\ninfluence of his splendid friend. It is hardly too much to say that all\nthe rest of Pope's work is directly traceable to Bolingbroke. The 'Essay\non Man' was built up on the precepts of Bolingbroke's philosophy; the\n'Imitations of Horace' were undertaken at Bolingbroke's suggestion; and\nthe whole tone of Pope's political and social satire during the years\nfrom 1731 to 1738 reflects the spirit of that opposition to the\nadministration of Walpole and to the growing influence of the commercial\nclass, which was at once inspired and directed by Bolingbroke. And yet\nit is exactly in the work of this period that we find the best and with\nperhaps one exception, the 'Essay on Man', the most original, work of\nPope. He has obtained an absolute command over his instrument of\nexpression. In his hands the heroic couplet sings, and laughs, and\nchats, and thunders. He has turned from the ignoble warfare with the\ndunces to satirize courtly frivolity and wickedness in high places. And\nmost important of all to the student of Pope, it is in these last works\nthat his personality is most clearly revealed. It has been well said\nthat the best introduction to the study of Pope, the man, is to get the\n'Epistle to Arbuthnot' by heart.\n\nPope gradually persuaded himself that all the works of these years, the\n'Essay on Man', the 'Satires, Epistles', and 'Moral Essays', were but\nparts of one stupendous whole. He told Spence in the last years of his\nlife: \"I had once thought of completing my ethic work in four\nbooks.--The first, you know, is on the Nature of Man [the 'Essay on\nMan']; the second would have been on knowledge and its limits--here\nwould have come in an Essay on Education, part of which I have inserted\nin the 'Dunciad' ['i.e.' in the Fourth Book, published in 1742]. The\nthird was to have treated of Government, both ecclesiastical and\ncivil--and this was what chiefly stopped my going on. I could not have\nsaid what 'I would' have said without provoking every church on the face\nof the earth; and I did not care for living always in boiling\nwater.--This part would have come into my 'Brutus' [an epic poem which\nPope never completed], which is planned already. The fourth would have\nbeen on Morality; in eight or nine of the most concerning branches of\nit.\"\n\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, to believe that Pope with his\nirregular methods of work and illogical habit of thought had planned so\nvast and elaborate a system before he began its execution. It is far\nmore likely that he followed his old method of composing on the\ninspiration of the moment, and produced the works in question with\nlittle thought of their relation or interdependence. But in the last\nyears of his life, when he had made the acquaintance of Warburton, and\nwas engaged in reviewing and perfecting the works of this period, he\nnoticed their general similarity in form and spirit, and, possibly under\nWarburton's influence, conceived the notion of combining and\nsupplementing them to form that \"Greater Essay on Man\" of which he spoke\nto Spence, and of which Warburton himself has given us a detailed\naccount.\n\nWarburton, a wide-read, pompous, and polemical clergyman, had introduced\nhimself to the notice of Pope by a defense of the philosophical and\nreligious principles of the 'Essay on Man'. In spite of the influence of\nthe free-thinking Bolingbroke, Pope still remained a member of the\nCatholic church and sincerely believed himself to be an orthodox, though\nliberal, Christian, and he had, in consequence, been greatly\ndisconcerted by a criticism of his poem published in Switzerland and\nlately translated into English. Its author, Pierre de Crousaz,\nmaintained, and with a considerable degree of truth, that the principles\nof Pope's poem if pushed to their logical conclusion were destructive to\nreligion and would rank their author rather among atheists than\ndefenders of the faith. The very word \"atheist\" was at that day\nsufficient to put the man to whom it was applied beyond the pale of\npolite society, and Pope, who quite lacked the ability to refute in\nlogical argument the attack of de Crousaz, was proportionately delighted\nwhen Warburton came forward in his defense, and in a series of letters\nasserted that Pope's whole intention was to vindicate the ways of God to\nman, and that de Crousaz had mistaken his purpose and misunderstood his\nlanguage. Pope's gratitude to his defender knew no bounds; he declared\nthat Warburton understood the 'Essay' better than he did himself; he\npronounced him the greatest critic he ever knew, secured an introduction\nto him, introduced him to his own rich and influential friends, in short\nmade the man's fortune for him outright. When the University of Oxford\nhesitated to give Warburton, who had never attended a university, the\ndegree of D.D., Pope declined to accept the degree of D.C.L. which had\nbeen offered him at the same time, and wrote the Fourth Book of the\n'Dunciad' to satirize the stupidity of the university authorities. In\nconjunction with Warburton he proceeded further to revise the whole\npoem, for which his new friend wrote notes and a ponderous introduction,\nand made the capital mistake of substituting the frivolous, but clever,\nColley Gibber, with whom he had recently become embroiled, for his old\nenemy, Theobald, as the hero. And the last year of his life was spent in\ngetting out new editions of his poems accompanied by elaborate\ncommentaries from the pen of Warburton.\n\nIn the spring of 1744, it was evident that Pope was failing fast. In\naddition to his other ailments he was now attacked by an asthmatical\ndropsy, which no efforts of his physicians could remove. Yet he\ncontinued to work almost to the last, and distributed copies of his\n'Ethic Epistles' to his friends about three weeks before his death, with\nthe smiling remark that like the dying Socrates he was dispensing his\nmorality among his friends. His mind began to wander; he complained that\nhe saw all things as through a curtain, and told Spence once \"with a\nsmile of great pleasure and with the greatest softness\" that he had seen\na vision. His friends were devoted in their attendance. Bolingbroke sat\nweeping by his chair, and on Spence's remarking how Pope with every\nrally was always saying something kindly of his friends, replied: \"I\nnever in my life knew a man that had so tender a heart for his\nparticular friends, or a more general friendship for mankind. I have\nknown him these thirty years; and value myself more for that man's love\nthan\"--here his head dropped and his voice broke in tears. It was\nnoticed that whenever Patty Blount came into the room, the dying flame\nof life flashed up in a momentary glow. At the very end a friend\nreminded Pope that as a professed Catholic he ought to send for a\npriest. The dying man replied that he did not believe it essential, but\nthanked him for the suggestion. When the priest appeared, Pope attempted\nto rise from his bed that he might receive the sacrament kneeling, and\nthe priest came out from the sick room \"penetrated to the last degree\nwith the state of mind in which he found his penitent, resigned and\nwrapt up in the love of God and man.\" The hope that sustained Pope to\nthe end was that of immortality. \"I am so certain of the soul's being\nimmortal,\" he whispered, almost with his last breath, \"that I seem to\nfeel it within me, as it were by intuition.\" He died on the evening of\nMay 30, so quietly that his friends hardly knew that the end had come.\nHe was buried in Twickenham Church, near the monument he had erected to\nhis parents, and his coffin was carried to the grave by six of the\npoorest men of the parish.\n\nIt is plain even from so slight a sketch as this that the common\nconception of Pope as \"the wicked wasp of Twickenham,\" a bitter,\njealous, and malignant spirit, is utterly out of accord with the facts\nof his life. Pope's faults of character lie on the surface, and the most\nperceptible is that which has done him most harm in the eyes of\nEnglish-speaking men. He was by nature, perhaps by training also,\nuntruthful. If he seldom stooped to an outright lie, he never hesitated\nto equivocate; and students of his life have found that it is seldom\npossible to take his word on any point where his own works or interests\nwere concerned. I have already (p. x) attempted to point out the\nprobable cause of this defect; and it is, moreover, worth while to\nremark that Pope's manifold intrigues and evasions were mainly of the\ndefensive order. He plotted and quibbled not so much to injure others as\nto protect himself. To charge Pope with treachery to his friends, as has\nsometimes been done, is wholly to misunderstand his character.\n\nAnother flaw, one can hardly call it a vice, in Pope's character was his\nconstant practice of considering everything that came in his way as\ncopy. It was this which led him to reclaim his early letters from his\nfriends, to alter, rewrite, and redate them, utterly unconscious of the\ntrouble which he was preparing for his future biographers. The letters,\nhe thought, were good reading but not so good as he could make them, and\nhe set to work to improve them with all an artist's zeal, and without a\ntrace of a historian's care for facts. It was this which led him to\nembody in his description of a rich fool's splendid house and park\ncertain unmistakable traces of a living nobleman's estate and to start\nin genuine amazement and regret when the world insisted on identifying\nthe nobleman and the fool. And when Pope had once done a good piece of\nwork, he had all an artist's reluctance to destroy it. He kept bits of\nverse by him for years and inserted them into appropriate places in his\npoems. This habit it was that brought about perhaps the gravest charge\nthat has ever been made against Pope, that of accepting \u00c2\u00a31000 to\nsuppress a satiric portrait of the old Duchess of Marlborough, and yet\nof publishing it in a revision of a poem that he was engaged on just\nbefore his death. The truth seems to be that Pope had drawn this\nportrait in days when he was at bitter enmity with the Duchess, and\nafter the reconcilement that took place, unwilling to suppress it\nentirely, had worked it over, and added passages out of keeping with the\nfirst design, but pointing to another lady with whom he was now at odds.\nPope's behavior, we must admit, was not altogether creditable, but it\nwas that of an artist reluctant to throw away good work, not that of a\nruffian who stabs a woman he has taken money to spare.\n\nFinally Pope was throughout his life, and notably in his later years,\nthe victim of an irritable temper and a quick, abusive tongue. His\nirritability sprang in part, we may believe, from his physical\nsufferings, even more, however, from the exquisitely sensitive heart\nwhich made him feel a coarse insult as others would a blow. And of the\ncoarseness of the insults that were heaped upon Pope no one except the\ncareful student of his life can have any conception. His genius, his\nmorals, his person, his parents, and his religion were overwhelmed in\none indiscriminate flood of abuse. Too high spirited to submit tamely to\nthese attacks, too irritable to laugh at them, he struck back, and his\nweapon was personal satire which cut like a whip and left a brand like a\nhot iron. And if at times, as in the case of Addison, Pope was mistaken\nin his object and assaulted one who was in no sense his enemy, the fault\nlies not so much in his alleged malice as in the unhappy state of\nwarfare in which he lived.\n\nOver against the faults of Pope we may set more than one noble\ncharacteristic. The sensitive heart and impulsive temper that led him so\noften into bitter warfare, made him also most susceptible to kindness\nand quick to pity suffering. He was essentially of a tender and loving\nnature, a devoted son, and a loyal friend, unwearied in acts of kindness\nand generosity. His ruling passion, to use his own phrase, was a\ndevotion to letters, and he determined as early and worked as diligently\nto make himself a poet as ever Milton did. His wretched body was\ndominated by a high and eager mind, and he combined in an unparalleled\ndegree the fiery energy of the born poet with the tireless patience of\nthe trained artist.\n\nBut perhaps the most remarkable characteristic of Pope is his manly\nindependence. In an age when almost without exception his fellow-writers\nstooped to accept a great man's patronage or sold their talents into the\nslavery of politics, Pope stood aloof from patron and from party. He\nrepeatedly declined offers of money that were made him, even when no\ncondition was attached. He refused to change his religion, though he was\nfar from being a devout Catholic, in order to secure a comfortable\nplace. He relied upon his genius alone for his support, and his genius\ngave him all that he asked, a modest competency. His relations with his\nrich and powerful friends were marked by the same independent spirit. He\nnever cringed or flattered, but met them on even terms, and raised\nhimself by merit alone from his position as the unknown son of an humble\nshopkeeper to be the friend and associate of the greatest fortunes and\nmost powerful minds in England. It is not too much to say that the\ncareer of a man of letters as we know it to-day, a career at once\nhonorable and independent, takes its rise from the life and work of\nAlexander Pope.\n\nThe long controversies that have raged about Pope's rank as a poet seem\nat last to be drawing to a close; and it has become possible to strike a\nbalance between the exaggerated praise of his contemporaries and the\nreckless depreciation of romantic critics. That he is not a poet of the\nfirst order is plain, if for no other reason than that he never produced\na work in any of the greatest forms of poetry. The drama, the epic, the\nlyric, were all outside his range. On the other hand, unless a\ndefinition of poetry be framed--and Dr. Johnson has well remarked that\n\"to circumscribe poetry by a definition will only show the narrowness of\nthe definer\"--which shall exclude all gnomic and satiric verse, and so\ndebar the claims of Hesiod, Juvenal, and Boileau, it is impossible to\ndeny that Pope is a true poet. Certain qualities of the highest poet\nPope no doubt lacked, lofty imagination, intense passion, wide human\nsympathy. But within the narrow field which he marked out for his own he\napproaches perfection as nearly as any English poet, and Pope's merit\nconsists not merely in the smoothness of his verse or the polish of\nseparate epigrams, as is so often stated, but quite as much in the vigor\nof his conceptions and the unity and careful proportion of each poem as\na whole. It is not too much to say that 'The Rape of the Lock' is one of\nthe best-planned poems in any language. It is as symmetrical and\nexquisitely finished as a Grecian temple.\n\nHistorically Pope represents the fullest embodiment of that spirit which\nbegan to appear in English literature about the middle of the\nseventeenth century, and which we are accustomed to call the \"classical\"\nspirit. In essence this movement was a protest against the irregularity\nand individual license of earlier poets. Instead of far-fetched wit and\nfanciful diction, the classical school erected the standards of common\nsense in conception and directness in expression. And in so doing they\nrestored poetry which had become the diversion of the few to the\npossession of the many. Pope, for example, is preeminently the poet of\nhis time. He dealt with topics that were of general interest to the\nsociety in which he lived; he pictured life as he saw it about him. And\nthis accounts for his prompt and general acceptance by the world of his\nday.\n\nFor the student of English literature Pope's work has a threefold value.\nIt represents the highest achievement of one of the great movements in\nthe developments of English verse. It reflects with unerring accuracy\nthe life and thought of his time--not merely the outward life of beau\nand belle in the days of Queen Anne, but the ideals of the age in art,\nphilosophy, and politics. And finally it teaches as hardly any other\nbody of English verse can be said to do, the perennial value of\nconscious and controlling art. Pope's work lives and will live while\nEnglish poetry is read, not because of its inspiration, imagination, or\ndepth of thought, but by its unity of design, vigor of expression, and\nperfection of finish--by those qualities, in short, which show the poet\nas an artist in verse.\n\n\n\nCHIEF DATES IN POPE'S LIFE\n\n1688 Born, May 21.\n\n1700 Moves to Binfield.\n\n1709 'Pastorals'.\n\n1711 'Essay on Criticism'.\n\n1711-12 Contributes to 'Spectator'.\n\n1712 'Rape of the Lock', first form.\n\n1713 'Windsor Forest'.\n\n1713  Issues proposals for translation of Homer.\n\n1714 'Rape of the Lock', second form.\n\n1715 First volume of the 'Iliad'.\n\n1715 'Temple of Fame'.\n\n1717 Pope's father dies.\n\n1717 'Works', including some new poems.\n\n1719 Settles at Twickenham.\n\n1720 Sixth and last volume of the 'Iliad'.\n\n1722 Begins translation of 'Odyssey'.\n\n1725 Edits Shakespeare.\n\n1726 Finishes translation of 'Odyssey'.\n\n1727-8 'Miscellanies' by Pope and Swift.\n\n1728-9 'Dunciad'.\n\n1731-2 'Moral Essays': 'Of Taste', 'Of the Use of Riches'.\n\n1733-4 'Essay on Man'.\n\n1733-8 'Satires and Epistles'.\n\n1735 'Works'.\n\n1735 'Letters' published by Curll.\n\n1741 'Works in Prose'; vol.

ARABELLA FERMOR\n\nMADAM,\n\nIt will be in vain to deny that I have some regard for this piece, since\nI dedicate it to You. Yet you may bear me witness, it was intended only\nto divert a few young Ladies, who have good sense and good humour enough\nto laugh not only at their sex's little unguarded follies, but at their\nown. But as it was communicated with the air of a Secret, it soon found\nits way into the world. An imperfect copy having been offer'd to a\nBookseller, you had the good-nature for my sake to consent to the\npublication of one more correct: This I was forc'd to, before I had\nexecuted half my design, for the Machinery was entirely wanting to\ncompleat it.\n\nThe Machinery, Madam, is a term invented by the Critics, to signify that\npart which the Deities, Angels, or D\u00c3\u00a6mons are made to act in a Poem:\nFor the ancient Poets are in one respect like many modern Ladies: let an\naction be never so trivial in itself, they always make it appear of the\nutmost importance. These Machines I determined to raise on a very new\nand odd foundation, the Rosicrucian doctrine of Spirits.\n\nI know how disagreeable it is to make use of hard words before a Lady;\nbut't is so much the concern of a Poet to have his works understood, and\nparticularly by your Sex, that you must give me leave to explain two or\nthree difficult terms.\n\nThe Rosicrucians are a people I must bring you acquainted with. The best\naccount I know of them is in a French book call'd 'Le Comte de\nGabalis', which both in its title and size is so like a Novel, that\nmany of the Fair Sex have read it for one by mistake. According to these\nGentlemen, the four Elements are inhabited by Spirits, which they call\nSylphs, Gnomes, Nymphs, and Salamanders. The Gnomes or D\u00c3\u00a6mons of Earth\ndelight in mischief; but the Sylphs whose habitation is in the Air, are\nthe best-condition'd creatures imaginable. For they say, any mortals may\nenjoy the most intimate familiarities with these gentle Spirits, upon a\ncondition very easy to all true Adepts, an inviolate preservation of\nChastity.\n\nAs to the following Canto's, all the passages of them are as fabulous,\nas the Vision at the beginning, or the Transformation at the end;\n(except the loss of your Hair, which I always mention with reverence).\nThe Human persons are as fictitious as the airy ones; and the character\nof Belinda, as it is now manag'd, resembles you in nothing but in\nBeauty.\n\nIf this Poem had as many Graces as there are in your Person, or in your\nMind, yet I could never hope it should pass thro' the world half so\nUncensur'd as You have done. But let its fortune be what it will, mine\nis happy enough, to have given me this occasion of assuring you that I\nam, with the truest esteem, Madam,\n\nYour most obedient, Humble Servant,\n\nA. Pope\n\n\n\n\n\nCANTO I\n\n\n  What dire offence from am'rous causes springs,\n  What mighty contests rise from trivial things,\n  I sing--This verse to CARYL, Muse! is due:\n  This, ev'n Belinda may vouchsafe to view:\n  Slight is the subject, but not so the praise,                    5\n  If She inspire, and He approve my lays.\n\n  Say what strange motive, Goddess! could compel\n  A well-bred Lord t' assault a gentle Belle?\n  O say what stranger cause, yet unexplor'd,\n  Could make a gentle Belle reject a Lord?                        10\n  In tasks so bold, can little men engage,\n  And in soft bosoms dwells such mighty Rage?\n\n  Sol thro' white curtains shot a tim'rous ray,\n  And oped those eyes that must eclipse the day:\n  Now lap-dogs give themselves the rousing shake,                 15\n  And sleepless lovers, just at twelve, awake:\n  Thrice rung the bell, the slipper knock'd the ground,\n  And the press'd watch return'd a silver sound.\n  Belinda still her downy pillow prest,\n  Her guardian SYLPH prolong'd the balmy rest:                    20\n  'Twas He had summon'd to her silent bed\n  The morning-dream that hover'd o'er her head;\n  A Youth more glitt'ring than a Birth-night Beau,\n  (That ev'n in slumber caus'd her cheek to glow)\n  Seem'd to her ear his winning lips to lay,                      25\n  And thus in whispers said, or seem'd to say.\n\n  Fairest of mortals, thou distinguish'd care\n  Of thousand bright Inhabitants of Air!\n  If e'er one vision touch.'d thy infant thought,\n  Of all the Nurse and all the Priest have taught;

                    130\n  From each she nicely culls with curious toil,\n  And decks the Goddess with the glitt'ring spoil.\n  This casket India's glowing gems unlocks,\n  And all Arabia breathes from yonder box.\n  The Tortoise here and Elephant unite,                          135\n  Transformed to combs, the speckled, and the white.\n  Here files of pins extend their shining rows,\n  Puffs, Powders, Patches, Bibles, Billet-doux.\n  Now awful Beauty puts on all its arms;\n  The fair each moment rises in her charms,                      140\n  Repairs her smiles, awakens ev'ry grace,\n  And calls forth all the wonders of her face;\n  Sees by degrees a purer blush arise,\n  And keener lightnings quicken in her eyes.\n  The busy Sylphs surround their darling care,                   145\n  These set the head, and those divide the hair,\n  Some fold the sleeve, whilst others plait the gown:\n  And Betty's prais'd for labours not her own.\n\n\n\n\n\nCANTO II\n\n\n  Not with more glories, in th' etherial plain,\n  The Sun first rises o'er the purpled main,\n  Than, issuing forth, the rival of his beams\n  Launch'd on the bosom of the silver Thames.\n  Fair Nymphs, and well-drest Youths around her shone.             5\n  But ev'ry eye was fix'd on her alone.\n  On her white breast a sparkling Cross she wore,\n  Which Jews might kiss, and Infidels adore.\n  Her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose,\n  Quick as her eyes, and as unfix'd as those:                     10\n  Favours to none, to all she smiles extends;\n  Oft she rejects, but never once offends.\n  Bright as the sun, her eyes the gazers strike,\n  And, like the sun, they shine on all alike.\n  Yet graceful ease, and sweetness void of pride,                 15\n  Might hide her faults, if Belles had faults to hide:\n  If to her share some female errors fall,\n  Look on her face, and you'll forget 'em all.\n\n  This Nymph, to the destruction of mankind,\n  Nourish'd two Locks, which graceful hung behind                 20\n  In equal curls, and well conspir'd to deck\n  With shining ringlets the smooth iv'ry neck.\n  Love in these labyrinths his slaves detains,\n  And mighty hearts are held in slender chains.\n  With hairy springes we the birds betray,                        25\n  Slight lines of hair surprise the finny prey,\n  Fair tresses man's imperial race ensnare,\n  And beauty draws us with a single hair.\n\n  Th' advent'rous Baron the bright locks admir'd;\n  He saw, he wish'd, and to the prize aspir'd.                    30\n  Resolv'd to win, he meditates the way,\n  By force to ravish, or by fraud betray;\n  For when success a Lover's toil attends,\n  Few ask, if fraud or force attain'd his ends.\n\n  For this, ere Phoebus rose, he had implor'd                     35\n  Propitious heav'n, and ev'ry pow'r ador'd,\n  But chiefly Love--to Love an Altar built,\n  Of twelve vast French Romances, neatly gilt.\n  There lay three garters, half a pair of gloves;\n  And all the trophies of his former loves;                       40\n  With tender Billet-doux he lights the pyre,\n  And breathes three am'rous sighs to raise the fire.\n  Then prostrate falls, and begs with ardent eyes\n  Soon to obtain, and long possess the prize:\n  The pow'rs gave ear, and granted half his pray'r,               45\n  The rest, the winds dispers'd in empty air.\n\n  But now secure the painted vessel glides,\n  The sun-beams trembling on the floating tides:\n  While melting music steals upon the sky,\n  And soften'd sounds along the waters die;                       50\n  Smooth flow the waves, the Zephyrs gently play,\n  Belinda smil'd, and all the world was gay.\n  All but the Sylph--with careful thoughts opprest,\n  Th' impending woe sat heavy on his breast.\n  He summons strait his Denizens of air;                          55\n  The lucid squadrons round the sails repair:\n  Soft o'er the shrouds a\u00c3\u00abrial whispers breathe,\n  That seem'd but Zephyrs to the train beneath.\n  Some to the sun their insect-wings unfold,\n  Waft on the breeze, or sink in clouds of gold;                  60\n  Transparent forms, too fine for mortal sight,\n  Their fluid bodies half dissolv'd in light,\n  Loose to the wind their airy garments flew,\n  Thin glitt'ring textures of the filmy dew,\n  Dipt in the richest tincture of the skies,                      65\n  Where light disports in ever-mingling dyes,\n  While ev'ry beam new transient colours flings,\n  Colours that change whene'er they wave their wings.\n  Amid the circle, on the gilded mast,\n  Superior by the head, was Ariel plac'd;                         70\n  His purple pinions op'ning to the sun,\n  He rais'd his azure wand, and thus begun.\n\n  Ye Sylphs and Sylphids, to your chief give ear!\n  Fays, Fairies, Genii, Elves, and D\u00c3\u00a6mons, hear!\n  Ye know the spheres and various tasks assign'd                  75\n  By laws eternal to th' a\u00c3\u00abrial kind.\n  Some in the fields of purest \u00c3\u0086ther play,\n  And bask and whiten in the blaze of day.\n  Some guide the course of wand'ring orbs on high,\n  Or roll the planets thro' the boundless sky.                    80\n  Some less refin'd, beneath the moon's pale light\n  Pursue the stars that shoot athwart the night,\n  Or suck the mists in grosser air below,\n  Or dip their pinions in the painted bow,\n  Or brew fierce tempests on the wintry main,                     85\n  Or o'er the glebe distil the kindly rain.\n  Others on earth o'er human race preside,\n  Watch all their ways, and all their actions guide:\n  Of these the chief the care of Nations own,\n  And guard with Arms divine the British Throne.                  90\n\n  Our humbler province is to tend the Fair,\n  Not a less pleasing, tho' less glorious care;\n  To save the powder from too rude a gale,\n  Nor let th' imprison'd-essences exhale;\n  To draw fresh colours from the vernal flow'rs;                  95\n  To steal from rainbows e'er they drop in show'rs\n  A brighter wash; to curl their waving hairs,\n  Assist their blushes, and inspire their airs;\n  Nay oft, in dreams, invention we bestow,\n  To change a Flounce, or add a Furbelow.                        100\n\n  This day, black Omens threat the brightest Fair,\n  That e'er deserv'd a watchful spirit's care;\n  Some dire disaster, or by force, or slight;\n  But what, or where, the fates have wrapt in night.\n  Whether the nymph shall break Diana's law,                     105\n  Or some frail China jar receive a flaw;\n  Or stain her honour or her new brocade;\n  Forget her pray'rs, or miss a masquerade;\n  Or lose her heart, or necklace, at a ball;\n  Or whether Heav'n has doom'd that Shock must fall.             110\n  Haste, then, ye spirits! to your charge repair:\n  The flutt'ring fan be Zephyretta's care;\n  The drops to thee, Brillante, we consign;\n  And, Momentilla, let the watch be thine;\n  Do thou, Crispissa, tend her fav'rite Lock;                    115\n  Ariel himself shall be the guard of Shock.\n\n  To fifty chosen Sylphs, of special note,\n  We trust th' important charge, the Petticoat:\n  Oft have we known that seven-fold fence to fail,\n  Tho' stiff with hoops, and arm'd with ribs of whale;           120\n  Form a strong line about the silver bound,\n  And guard the wide circumference around.\n\n  Whatever spirit, careless of his charge,\n  His post neglects, or leaves the fair at large,\n  Shall feel sharp vengeance soon o'ertake his sins,             125\n  Be stopp'd in vials, or transfix'd with pins;\n  Or plung'd in lakes of bitter washes lie,\n  Or wedg'd whole ages in a bodkin's eye:\n  Gums and Pomatums shall his flight restrain,\n  While clogg'd he beats his silken wings in vain;               130\n  Or Alum styptics with contracting pow'r\n  Shrink his thin essence like a rivel'd flow'r:\n  Or, as Ixion fix'd, the wretch shall feel\n  The giddy motion of the whirling Mill,\n  In fumes of burning Chocolate shall glow,                      135\n  And tremble at the sea that froths below!\n\n  He spoke; the spirits from the sails descend;\n  Some, orb in orb, around the nymph extend;\n  Some thrid the mazy ringlets of her hair;\n  Some hang upon the pendants of her ear:                        140\n  With beating hearts the dire event they wait,\n  Anxious, and trembling for the birth of Fate.\n\n\n\n\n\nCANTO III\n\n\n  Close by those meads, for ever crown'd with flow'rs,\n  Where Thames with pride surveys his rising tow'rs,\n  There stands a structure of majestic frame,\n  Which from the neighb'ring Hampton takes its name.\n  Here Britain's statesmen oft the fall foredoom                   5\n  Of foreign Tyrants and of Nymphs at home;\n  Here thou, great ANNA! whom three realms obey.\n  Dost sometimes counsel take--and sometimes Tea.\n\n  Hither the heroes and the nymphs resort,\n  To taste awhile the pleasures of a Court;                       10\n  In various talk th' instructive hours they past,\n  Who gave the ball, or paid the visit last;\n  One speaks the glory of the British Queen,\n  And one describes a charming Indian screen;\n  A third interprets motions, looks, and eyes;                    15\n  At ev'ry word a reputation dies.\n  Snuff, or the fan, supply each pause of chat,\n  With singing, laughing, ogling, and _all that_.\n\n  Mean while, declining from the noon of day,\n  The sun obliquely shoots his burning ray;                       20\n  The hungry Judges soon the sentence sign,\n  And wretches hang that jury-men may dine;\n  The merchant from th' Exchange returns in peace,\n  And the long labours of the Toilet cease.\n  Belinda now, whom thirst of fame invites,                       25\n  Burns to encounter two advent'rous Knights,\n  At Ombre singly to decide their doom;\n  And swells her breast with conquests yet to come.\n  Straight the three bands prepare in arms to join,\n  Each band the number of the sacred nine.                        30\n\n  Soon as she spreads her hand, th' a\u00c3\u00abrial guard\n  Descend, and sit on each important card:\n  First Ariel perch'd upon a Matadore,\n  Then each, according to the rank they bore;\n  For Sylphs, yet mindful of their ancient race,                  35\n  Are, as when women, wondrous fond of place.\n  Behold, four Kings in majesty rever'd,\n  With hoary whiskers and a forky beard;\n  And four fair Queens whose hands sustain a flow'r,\n  Th' expressive emblem of their softer pow'r;                    40\n  Four Knaves in garbs succinct, a trusty band,\n  Caps on their heads, and halberts in their hand;\n  And particolour'd troops, a shining train,\n  Draw forth to combat on the velvet plain.\n\n  The skilful Nymph reviews her force with care:                  45\n  Let Spades be trumps! she said, and trumps they were.\n\n  Now move to war her sable Matadores,\n  In show like leaders of the swarthy Moors.\n  Spadillio first, unconquerable Lord!\n  Led off two captive trumps, and swept the board.                50\n  As many more Manillio forc'd to yield,\n  And march'd a victor from the verdant field.\n  Him Basto follow'd, but his fate more hard\n  Gain'd but one trump and one Plebeian card.\n  With his broad sabre next, a chief in years,                    55\n  The hoary Majesty of Spades appears,\n  Puts forth one manly leg, to sight reveal'd,\n  The rest, his many-colour'd robe conceal'd.\n  The rebel Knave, who dares his prince engage,\n  Proves the just victim of his royal rage.                       60\n  Ev'n mighty Pam, that Kings and Queens o'erthrew\n  And mow'd down armies in the fights of Lu,\n  Sad chance of war! now destitute of aid,\n  Falls undistinguish'd by the victor spade!\n\n  Thus far both armies to Belinda yield;                          65\n  Now to the Baron fate inclines the field.\n  His warlike Amazon her host invades,\n  Th' imperial consort of the crown of Spades.\n  The Club's black Tyrant first her victim dy'd,\n  Spite of his haughty mien, and barb'rous pride:                 70\n  What boots the regal circle on his head,\n  His giant limbs, in state unwieldy spread;\n  That long behind he trails his pompous robe,\n  And, of all monarchs, only grasps the globe?\n\n  The Baron now his Diamonds pours apace;                         75\n  Th' embroider'd King who shows but half his face,\n  And his refulgent Queen, with pow'rs combin'd\n  Of broken troops an easy conquest find.\n  Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, in wild disorder seen,\n  With throngs promiscuous strow the level green.                 80\n  Thus when dispers'd a routed army runs,\n  Of Asia's troops, and Afric's sable sons,\n  With like confusion different nations fly,\n  Of various habit, and of various dye,\n  The pierc'd battalions dis-united fall,                         85\n  In heaps on heaps; one fate o'erwhelms them all.\n\n  The Knave of Diamonds tries his wily arts,\n  And wins (oh shameful chance!) the Queen of Hearts.\n  At this, the blood the virgin's cheek forsook,\n  A livid paleness spreads o'er all her look;                     90\n  She sees, and trembles at th' approaching ill,\n  Just in the jaws of ruin, and Codille.\n  And now (as oft in some distemper'd State)\n  On one nice Trick depends the gen'ral fate.\n  An Ace of Hearts steps forth: The King unseen                   95\n  Lurk'd in her hand, and mourn'd his captive Queen:\n  He springs to Vengeance with an eager pace,\n  And falls like thunder on the prostrate Ace.\n  The nymph exulting fills with shouts the sky;\n  The walls, the woods, and long canals reply.                   100\n\n  Oh thoughtless mortals! ever blind to fate,\n  Too soon dejected, and too soon elate.\n  Sudden, these honours shall be snatch'd away,\n  And curs'd for ever this victorious day.\n\n  For lo! the board with cups and spoons is crown'd,             105\n  The berries crackle, and the mill turns round;\n  On shining Altars of Japan they raise\n  The silver lamp; the fiery spirits blaze:\n  From silver spouts the grateful liquors glide,\n  While China's earth receives the smoking tide:                 110\n  At once they gratify their scent and taste,\n  And frequent cups prolong the rich repast.\n  Straight hover round the Fair her airy band;\n  Some, as she sipp'd, the fuming liquor fann'd,\n  Some o'er her lap their careful plumes display'd,              115\n  Trembling, and conscious of the rich brocade.\n  Coffee, (which makes the politician wise,\n  And see thro' all things with his half-shut eyes)\n  Sent up in vapours to the Baron's brain\n  New Stratagems, the radiant Lock to gain.                      120\n  Ah cease, rash youth! desist ere't is too late,\n  Fear the just Gods, and think of Scylla's Fate!\n  Chang'd to a bird, and sent to flit in air,\n  She dearly pays for Nisus' injur'd hair!\n\n  But when to mischief mortals bend their will,                  125\n  How soon they find fit instruments of ill!\n  Just then, Clarissa drew with tempting grace\n  A two-edg'd weapon from her shining case:\n  So Ladies in Romance assist their Knight,\n  Present the spear, and arm him for the fight.                  130\n  He takes the gift with rev'rence, and extends\n  The little engine on his fingers' ends;\n  This just behind Belinda's neck he spread,\n  As o'er the fragrant steams she bends her head.\n  Swift to the Lock a thousand Sprites repair,                   135\n  A thousand wings, by turns, blow back the hair;\n  And thrice they twitch'd the diamond in her ear;\n  Thrice she look'd back, and thrice the foe drew near.\n  Just in that instant, anxious Ariel sought\n  The close recesses of the Virgin's thought;                    140\n  As on the nosegay in her breast reclin'd,\n  He watch'd th' Ideas rising in her mind,\n  Sudden he view'd, in spite of all her art,\n  An earthly Lover lurking at her heart.\n  Amaz'd, confus'd, he found his pow'r expir'd,                  145\n  Resign'd to fate, and with a sigh retir'd.\n\n  The Peer now spreads the glitt'ring Forfex wide,\n  T' inclose the Lock; now joins it, to divide.\n  Ev'n then, before the fatal engine clos'd,\n  A wretched Sylph too fondly interpos'd;                        150\n  Fate urg'd the shears, and cut the Sylph in twain,\n  (But airy substance soon unites again)\n  The meeting points the sacred hair dissever\n  From the fair head, for ever, and for ever!\n\n  Then flash'd the living lightning from her eyes,               155\n  And screams of horror rend th' affrighted skies.\n  Not louder shrieks to pitying heav'n are cast,\n  When husbands, or when lapdogs breathe their last;\n  Or when rich China vessels fall'n from high,\n  In glitt'ring dust and painted fragments lie!                  160\n\n  Let wreaths of triumph now my temples twine\n  (The victor cry'd) the glorious Prize is mine!\n  While fish in streams, or birds delight in air,\n  Or in a coach and six the British Fair,\n  As long as Atalantis shall be read,                            165\n  Or the small pillow grace a Lady's bed,\n  While visits shall be paid on solemn days,\n  When num'rous wax-lights in bright order blaze,\n  While nymphs take treats, or assignations give,\n  So long my honour, name, and praise shall live!                170\n  What Time would spare, from Steel receives its date,\n  And monuments, like men, submit to fate!\n  Steel could the labour of the Gods destroy,\n  And strike to dust th' imperial tow'rs of Troy;\n  Steel could the works of mortal pride confound,                175\n  And hew triumphal arches to the ground.\n  What wonder then, fair nymph! thy hairs should feel,\n  The conqu'ring force of unresisted steel?\n\n\n\n\n\nCANTO IV\n\n\n  But anxious cares the pensive nymph oppress'd,\n  And secret passions labour'd in her breast.\n  Not youthful kings in battle seiz'd alive,\n  Not scornful virgins who their charms survive,\n  Not ardent lovers robb'd of all their bliss,                     5\n  Not ancient ladies when refus'd a kiss,\n  Not tyrants fierce that unrepenting die,\n  Not Cynthia when her manteau's pinn'd awry,\n  E'er felt such rage, resentment, and despair,\n  As thou, sad Virgin! for thy ravish'd Hair.                     10\n\n  For, that sad moment, when the Sylphs withdrew\n  And Ariel weeping from Belinda flew,\n  Umbriel, a dusky, melancholy sprite,\n  As ever sully'd the fair face of light,\n  Down to the central earth, his proper scene,                    15\n  Repair'd to search the gloomy Cave of Spleen.\n\n  Swift on his sooty pinions flits the Gnome,\n  And in a vapour reach'd the dismal dome.\n  No cheerful breeze this sullen region knows,\n  The dreaded East is all the wind that blows.                    20\n  Here in a grotto, shelter'd close from air,\n  And screen'd in shades from day's detested glare,\n  She sighs for ever on her pensive bed,\n  Pain at her side, and Megrim at her head.\n\n  Two handmaids wait the throne: alike in place,                  25\n  But diff'ring far in figure and in face.\n  Here stood Ill-nature like an ancient maid,\n  Her wrinkled form in black and white array'd;\n  With store of pray'rs, for mornings, nights, and noons,\n  Her hand is fill'd; her bosom with lampoons.                    30\n\n  There Affectation, with a sickly mien,\n  Shows in her cheek the roses of eighteen,\n  Practis'd to lisp, and hang the head aside.\n  Faints into airs, and languishes with pride,\n  On the rich quilt sinks with becoming woe,                      35\n  Wrapt in a gown, for sickness, and for show.\n  The fair ones feel such maladies as these,\n  When each new night-dress gives a new disease.\n\n  A constant Vapour o'er the palace flies;\n  Strange phantoms rising as the mists arise;                     40\n  Dreadful, as hermit's dreams in haunted shades,\n  Or bright, as visions of expiring maids.\n  Now glaring fiends, and snakes on rolling spires,\n  Pale spectres, gaping tombs, and purple fires:\n  Now lakes of liquid gold, Elysian scenes,                       45\n  And crystal domes, and angels in machines.\n\n  Unnumber'd throngs on every side are seen,\n  Of bodies chang'd to various forms by Spleen.\n  Here living Tea-pots stand, one arm held out,\n  One bent; the handle this, and that the spout:                  50\n  A Pipkin there, like Homer's Tripod walks;\n  Here sighs a Jar, and there a Goose-pie talks;\n  Men prove with child, as pow'rful fancy works,\n  And maids turn'd bottles, call aloud for corks.\n\n  Safe past the Gnome thro' this fantastic band,                  55\n  A branch of healing Spleenwort in his hand.\n  Then thus address'd the pow'r: \"Hail, wayward Queen!\n  Who rule the sex to fifty from fifteen:\n  Parent of vapours and of female wit,\n  Who give th' hysteric, or poetic fit,                           60\n  On various tempers act by various ways,\n  Make some take physic, others scribble plays;\n  Who cause the proud their visits to delay,\n  And send the godly in a pet to pray.\n  A nymph there is, that all thy pow'r disdains,                  65\n  And thousands more in equal mirth maintains.\n  But oh! if e'er thy Gnome could spoil a grace,\n  Or raise a pimple on a beauteous face,\n  Like Citron-waters matrons cheeks inflame,\n  Or change complexions at a losing game;                         70\n  If e'er with airy horns I planted heads,\n  Or rumpled petticoats, or tumbled beds,\n  Or caus'd suspicion when no soul was rude,\n  Or discompos'd the head-dress of a Prude,\n  Or e'er to costive lap-dog gave disease,                        75\n  Which not the tears of brightest eyes could ease:\n  Hear me, and touch Belinda with chagrin,\n  That single act gives half the world the spleen.\"\n\n  The Goddess with a discontented air\n  Seems to reject him, tho' she grants his pray'r.                80\n  A wond'rous Bag with both her hands she binds,\n  Like that where once Ulysses held the winds;\n  There she collects the force of female lungs,\n  Sighs, sobs, and passions, and the war of tongues.\n  A Vial next she fills with fainting fears,                      85\n  Soft sorrows, melting griefs, and flowing tears.\n  The Gnome rejoicing bears her gifts away,\n  Spreads his black wings, and slowly mounts to day.\n\n  Sunk in Thalestris' arms the nymph he found,\n  Her eyes dejected and her hair unbound.                         90\n  Full o'er their heads the swelling bag he rent,\n  And all the Furies issu'd at the vent.\n  Belinda burns with more than mortal ire,\n  And fierce Thalestris fans the rising fire.\n  \"O wretched maid!\" she spread her hands, and cry'd,             95\n  (While Hampton's echoes, \"Wretched maid!\" reply'd)\n  \"Was it for this you took such constant care\n  The bodkin, comb, and essence to prepare?\n  For this your locks in paper durance bound,\n  For this with tort'ring irons wreath'd around?                 100\n  For this with fillets strain'd your tender head,\n  And bravely bore the double loads of lead?\n  Gods! shall the ravisher display your hair,\n  While the Fops envy, and the Ladies stare!\n  Honour forbid! at whose unrivall'd shrine                      105\n  Ease, pleasure, virtue, all our sex resign.\n  Methinks already I your tears survey,\n  Already hear the horrid things they say,\n  Already see you a degraded toast,\n  And all your honour in a whisper lost!                         110\n  How shall I, then, your helpless fame defend?\n  'T will then be infamy to seem your friend!\n  And shall this prize, th' inestimable prize,\n  Expos'd thro' crystal to the gazing eyes,\n  And heighten'd by the diamond's circling rays,                 115\n  On that rapacious hand for ever blaze?\n  Sooner shall grass in Hyde-park Circus grow,\n  And wits take lodgings in the sound of Bow;\n  Sooner let earth, air, sea, to Chaos fall,\n  Men, monkeys, lap-dogs, parrots, perish all!\"                  120\n\n  She said; then raging to Sir Plume repairs,\n  And bids her Beau demand the precious hairs;\n  (Sir Plume of amber snuff-box justly vain,\n  And the nice conduct of a clouded cane)\n  With earnest eyes, and round unthinking face,                  125\n  He first the snuff-box open'd, then the case,\n  And thus broke out--\"My Lord, why, what the devil?\n  \"Z--ds! damn the lock! 'fore Gad, you must be civil!\n  Plague on't!'t is past a jest--nay prithee, pox!\n  Give her the hair\"--he spoke, and rapp'd his box.              130\n\n  \"It grieves me much\" (reply'd the Peer again)\n  \"Who speaks so well should ever speak in vain.\n  But by this Lock, this sacred Lock I swear,\n  (Which never more shall join its parted hair;\n  Which never more its honours shall renew,                      135\n  Clipp'd from the lovely head where late it grew)\n  That while my nostrils draw the vital air,\n  This hand, which won it, shall for ever wear.\"\n  He spoke, and speaking, in proud triumph spread\n  The long-contended honours of her head.                        140\n\n  But Umbriel, hateful Gnome! forbears not so;\n  He breaks the Vial whence the sorrows flow.\n  Then see! the nymph in beauteous grief appears,\n  Her eyes half-languishing, half-drown'd in tears;\n  On her heav'd bosom hung her drooping head,                    145\n  Which, with a sigh, she rais'd; and thus she said.\n  \"For ever curs'd be this detested day,\n  Which snatch'd my best, my fav'rite curl away!\n  Happy!

frail beauty must decay,                       25\n  Curl'd or uncurl'd, since Locks will turn to grey;\n  Since painted, or not painted, all shall fade,\n  And she who scorns a man, must die a maid;\n  What then remains but well our pow'r to use,\n  And keep good-humour still whate'er we lose?                    30\n  And trust me, dear! good-humour can prevail,\n  When airs, and flights, and screams, and scolding fail.\n  Beauties in vain their pretty eyes may roll;\n  Charms strike the sight, but merit wins the soul.\"\n\n  So spoke the Dame, but no applause ensu'd;                      35\n  Belinda frown'd, Thalestris call'd her Prude.\n  \"To arms, to arms!\" the fierce Virago cries,\n  And swift as lightning to the combat flies.\n  All side in parties, and begin th' attack;\n  Fans clap, silks rustle, and tough whalebones crack;            40\n  Heroes' and Heroines' shouts confus'dly rise,\n  And bass, and treble voices strike the skies.\n  No common weapons in their hands are found,\n  Like Gods they fight, nor dread a mortal wound.\n\n  So when bold Homer makes the Gods engage,                       45\n  And heav'nly breasts with human passions rage;\n  'Gainst Pallas, Mars; Latona, Hermes arms;\n  And all Olympus rings with loud alarms:\n  Jove's thunder roars, heav'n trembles all around,\n  Blue Neptune storms, the bellowing deeps resound:               50\n  Earth shakes her nodding tow'rs, the ground gives way.\n  And the pale ghosts start at the flash of day!\n\n  Triumphant Umbriel on a sconce's height\n  Clapp'd his glad wings, and sate to view the fight:\n  Propp'd on the bodkin spears, the Sprites survey                55\n  The growing combat, or assist the fray.\n\n  While thro' the press enrag'd Thalestris flies,\n  And scatters death around from both her eyes,\n  A Beau and Witling perish'd in the throng,\n  One died in metaphor, and one in song.                          60\n  \"O cruel nymph! a living death I bear,\"\n  Cry'd Dapperwit, and sunk beside his chair.\n  A mournful glance Sir Fopling upwards cast,\n  \"Those eyes are made so killing\"--was his last.\n  Thus on M\u00c3\u00a6ander's flow'ry margin lies                           65\n  Th' expiring Swan, and as he sings he dies.\n\n  When bold Sir Plume had drawn Clarissa down,\n  Chloe stepp'd in, and kill'd him with a frown;\n  She smil'd to see the doughty hero slain,\n  But, at her smile, the Beau reviv'd again.                      70\n\n  Now Jove suspends his golden scales in air,\n  Weighs the Men's wits against the Lady's hair;\n  The doubtful beam long nods from side to side;\n  At length the wits mount up, the hairs subside.\n\n  See, fierce Belinda on the Baron flies,                         75\n  With more than usual lightning in her eyes:\n  Nor fear'd the Chief th' unequal fight to try,\n  Who sought no more than on his foe to die.\n  But this bold Lord with manly strength endu'd,\n  She with one finger and a thumb subdu'd:                        80\n  Just where the breath of life his nostrils drew,\n  A charge of Snuff the wily virgin threw;\n  The Gnomes direct, to ev'ry atom just,\n  The pungent grains of titillating dust.\n  Sudden, with starting tears each eye o'erflows,                 85\n  And the high dome re-echoes to his nose.\n\n  Now meet thy fate, incens'd Belinda cry'd,\n  And drew a deadly bodkin from her side.\n  (The same, his ancient personage to deck,\n  Her great great grandsire wore about his neck,                  90\n  In three seal-rings; which after, melted down,\n  Form'd a vast buckle for his widow's gown:\n  Her infant grandame's whistle next it grew,\n  The bells she jingled, and the whistle blew;\n  Then in a bodkin grac'd her mother's hairs,                     95\n  Which long she wore, and now Belinda wears.)\n\n  \"Boast not my fall\" (he cry'd) \"insulting foe!\n  Thou by some other shalt be laid as low,\n  Nor think, to die dejects my lofty mind:\n  All that I dread is leaving you behind!                        100\n  Rather than so, ah let me still survive,\n  And burn in Cupid's flames--but burn alive.\"\n\n  \"Restore the Lock!\" she cries; and all around\n  \"Restore the Lock!\" the vaulted roofs rebound.\n  Not fierce Othello in so loud a strain                         105\n  Roar'd for the handkerchief that caus'd his pain.\n  But see how oft ambitious aims are cross'd,\n  And chiefs contend 'till all the prize is lost!\n  The Lock, obtain'd with guilt, and kept with pain,\n  In ev'ry place is sought, but sought in vain:                  110\n  With such a prize no mortal must be blest,\n  So heav'n decrees! with heav'n who can contest?\n\n  Some thought it mounted to the Lunar sphere,\n  Since all things lost on earth are treasur'd there.\n  There Hero's wits are kept in pond'rous vases,                 115\n  And beau's in snuff-boxes and tweezer-cases.\n  There broken vows and death-bed alms are found,\n  And lovers' hearts with ends of riband bound,\n  The courtier's promises, and sick man's pray'rs,\n  The smiles of harlots, and the tears of heirs,                 120\n  Cages for gnats, and chains to yoke a flea,\n  Dry'd butterflies, and tomes of casuistry.\n\n  But trust the Muse--she saw it upward rise,\n  Tho' mark'd by none but quick, poetic eyes:\n  (So Rome's great founder to the heav'ns withdrew,              125\n  To Proculus alone confess'd in view)\n  A sudden Star, it shot thro' liquid air,\n  And drew behind a radiant trail of hair.\n  Not Berenice's Locks first rose so bright,\n  The heav'ns bespangling with dishevell'd light.                130\n  The Sylphs behold it kindling as it flies,\n  And pleas'd pursue its progress thro' the skies.\n\n  This the Beau monde shall from the Mall survey,\n  And hail with music its propitious ray.\n  This the blest Lover shall for Venus take,                     135\n  And send up vows from Rosamonda's lake.\n  This Partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies,\n  When next he looks thro' Galileo's eyes;\n  And hence th' egregious wizard shall foredoom\n  The fate of Louis, and the fall of Rome.                       140\n\n  Then cease, bright Nymph! to mourn thy ravish'd hair,\n  Which adds new glory to the shining sphere!\n  Not all the tresses that fair head can boast,\n  Shall draw such envy as the Lock you lost.\n  For, after all the murders of your eye,                        145\n  When, after millions slain, yourself shall die:\n  When those fair suns shall set, as set they must,\n  And all those tresses shall be laid in dust,\n  This Lock, the Muse shall consecrate to fame,\n  And 'midst the stars inscribe Belinda's name.                  150\n\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS OF THE ESSAY ON CRITICISM\n\n\nPART I\n\n\nIntroduction.

                      55\n  Thus in the soul while memory prevails,\n  The solid pow'r of understanding fails;\n  Where beams of warm imagination play,\n  The memory's soft figures melt away.\n  One science only will one genius fit;                             60\n  So vast is art, so narrow human wit:\n  Not only bounded to peculiar arts,\n  But oft in those confin'd to single parts.\n  Like kings we lose the conquests gain'd before,\n  By vain ambition still to make them more;                         65\n  Each might his sev'ral province well command,\n  Would all but stoop to what they understand.\n\n  First follow Nature, and your judgment frame\n  By her just standard, which is still the same:\n  Unerring NATURE, still divinely bright,                           70\n  One clear, unchang'd, and universal light,\n  Life, force, and beauty, must to all impart,\n  At once the source, and end, and test of Art.\n  Art from that fund each just supply provides,\n  Works without show, and without pomp presides:                    75\n  In some fair body thus th' informing soul\n  With spirits feeds, with vigour fills the whole,\n  Each motion guides, and ev'ry nerve sustains;\n  Itself unseen, but in th' effects, remains.\n  Some, to whom Heav'n in wit has been profuse,                     80\n  Want as much more, to turn it to its use;\n  For wit and judgment often are at strife,\n  Tho' meant each other's aid, like man and wife.\n  'T is more to guide, than spur the Muse's steed;\n  Restrain his fury, than provoke his speed;                        85\n  The winged courser, like a gen'rous horse,\n  Shows most true mettle when you check his course.\n\n  Those RULES of old discovered, not devis'd,\n  Are Nature still, but Nature methodiz'd;\n  Nature, like liberty, is but restrain'd                           90\n  By the same laws which first herself ordain'd.\n\n  Hear how learn'd Greece her useful rules indites,\n  When to repress, and when indulge our flights:\n  High on Parnassus' top her sons she show'd,\n  And pointed out those arduous paths they trod;                    95\n  Held from afar, aloft, th' immortal prize,\n  And urg'd the rest by equal steps to rise.\n  Just precepts thus from great examples giv'n,\n  She drew from them what they deriv'd from Heav'n.\n  The gen'rous Critic fann'd the Poet's fire,                      100\n  And taught the world with reason to admire.\n  Then Criticism the Muse's handmaid prov'd,\n  To dress her charms, and make her more belov'd:\n  But following wits from that intention stray'd,\n  Who could not win the mistress, woo'd the maid;                  105\n  Against the Poets their own arms they turn'd,\n  Sure to hate most the men from whom they learn'd.\n  So modern 'Pothecaries, taught the art\n  By Doctor's bills to play the Doctor's part,\n  Bold in the practice of mistaken rules,                          110\n  Prescribe, apply, and call their masters fools.\n  Some on the leaves of ancient authors prey,\n  Nor time nor moths e'er spoil'd so much as they.\n  Some drily plain, without invention's aid,\n  Write dull receipts how poems may be made.                       115\n  These leave the sense, their learning to display,\n  And those explain the meaning quite away.\n\n  You then whose judgment the right course would steer,\n  Know well each ANCIENT'S proper character;\n  His fable, subject, scope in ev'ry page;                         120\n  Religion, Country, genius of his Age:\n  Without all these at once before your eyes,\n  Cavil you may, but never criticize.\n  Be Homer's works your study and delight,\n  Read them by day, and meditate by night;                         125\n  Thence form your judgment, thence your maxims bring,\n  And trace the Muses upward to their spring.\n  Still with itself compar'd, his text peruse;\n  And let your comment be the Mantuan Muse.\n\n  When first young Maro in his boundless mind                      130\n  A work t' outlast immortal Rome design'd,\n  Perhaps he seem'd above the critic's law,\n  And but from Nature's fountains scorn'd to draw:\n  But when t' examine ev'ry part he came,\n  Nature and Homer were, he found, the same.                       135\n  Convinc'd, amaz'd, he checks the bold design;\n  And rules as strict his labour'd work confine,\n  As if the Stagirite o'erlook'd each line.\n  Learn hence for ancient rules a just esteem;\n  To copy nature is to copy them.                                  140\n\n  Some beauties yet no Precepts can declare,\n  For there's a happiness as well as care.\n  Music resembles Poetry, in each\n  Are nameless graces which no methods teach,\n  And which a master-hand alone can reach.                         145\n  If, where the rules not far enough extend,\n  (Since rules were made but to promote their end)\n  Some lucky Licence answer to the full\n  Th' intent propos'd, that Licence is a rule.\n  Thus Pegasus, a nearer way to take,                              150\n  May boldly deviate from the common track;\n  From vulgar bounds with brave disorder part,\n  And snatch a grace beyond the reach of art,\n  Which without passing thro' the judgment, gains\n  The heart, and all its end at once attains.                      155\n  In prospects thus, some objects please our eyes,\n  Which out of nature's common order rise,\n  The shapeless rock, or hanging precipice.\n  Great wits sometimes may gloriously offend,\n  And rise to faults true Critics dare not mend.                  160\n  But tho' the Ancients thus their rules invade,\n  (As Kings dispense with laws themselves have made)\n  Moderns, beware! or if you must offend\n  Against the precept, ne'er transgress its End;\n  Let it be seldom, and compell'd by need;                        165\n  And have, at least, their precedent to plead.\n  The Critic else proceeds without remorse,\n  Seizes your fame, and puts his laws in force.\n  I know there are, to whose presumptuous thoughts\n  Those freer beauties, ev'n in them, seem faults.                170\n  Some figures monstrous and mis-shap'd appear,\n  Consider'd singly, or beheld too near,\n  Which, but proportion'd to their light, or place,\n  Due distance reconciles to form and grace.\n  A prudent chief not always must display                         175\n  His pow'rs in equal ranks, and fair array.\n  But with th' occasion and the place comply,\n  Conceal his force, nay seem sometimes to fly.\n  Those oft are stratagems which error seem,\n  Nor is it Homer nods, but we that dream.                        180\n\n  Still green with bays each ancient Altar stands,\n  Above the reach of sacrilegious hands;\n  Secure from Flames, from Envy's fiercer rage,\n  Destructive War, and all-involving Age.\n  See, from each clime the learn'd their incense bring!           185\n  Hear, in all tongues consenting P\u00c3\u00a6ans ring!\n  In praise so just let ev'ry voice be join'd,\n  And fill the gen'ral chorus of mankind.\n  Hail, Bards triumphant! born in happier days;\n  Immortal heirs of universal praise!                             190\n  Whose honours with increase of ages grow,\n  As streams roll down, enlarging as they flow;\n  Nations unborn your mighty names shall sound,\n  And worlds applaud that must not yet be found!\n  Oh may some spark of your celestial fire,                       195\n  The last, the meanest of your sons inspire,\n  (That on weak wings, from far, pursues your flights;\n  Glows while he reads, but trembles as he writes)\n  To teach vain Wits a science little known,\n  T' admire superior sense, and doubt their own!                  200\n\n  Of all the Causes which conspire to blind\n  Man's erring judgment, and misguide the mind,\n  What the weak head with strongest bias rules,\n  Is _Pride_, the never-failing voice of fools.\n  Whatever nature has in worth denied,                            205\n  She gives in large recruits of needful pride;\n  For as in bodies, thus in souls, we find\n  What wants in blood and spirits, swell'd with wind:\n  Pride, where wit fails, steps in to our defence,\n  And fills up all the mighty Void of sense.                      210\n  If once right reason drives that cloud away,\n  Truth breaks upon us with resistless day.\n  Trust not yourself; but your defects to know,\n  Make use of ev'ry friend--and ev'ry foe.\n\n  A _little learning_ is a dang'rous thing;                       215\n  Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring.\n  There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain,\n  And drinking largely sobers us again.\n  Fir'd at first sight with what the Muse imparts,\n  In fearless youth we tempt the heights of Arts,                 220\n  While from the bounded level of our mind\n  Short views we take, nor see the lengths behind;\n  But more advanc'd, behold with strange surprise\n  New distant scenes of endless science rise!\n  So pleas'd at first the tow'ring Alps we try,                   225\n  Mount o'er the vales, and seem to tread the sky,\n  Th' eternal snows appear already past,\n  And the first clouds and mountains seem the last;\n  But, those attain'd, we tremble to survey\n  The growing labours of the lengthen'd way,                      230\n  Th' increasing prospect tires our wand'ring eyes,\n  Hills peep o'er hills, and Alps on Alps arise!\n\n  A perfect Judge will read each work of Wit\n  With the same spirit that its author writ:\n  Survey the WHOLE, nor seek slight faults to find                235\n  Where nature moves, and rapture warms the mind;\n  Nor lose, for that malignant dull delight,\n  The gen'rous pleasure to be charm'd with Wit.\n  But in such lays as neither ebb, nor flow,\n  Correctly cold, and regularly low,                              240\n  That shunning faults, one quiet tenour keep,\n  We cannot blame indeed--but we may sleep.\n  In wit, as nature, what affects our hearts\n  Is not th' exactness of peculiar parts;\n  'Tis not a lip, or eye, we beauty call,                         245\n  But the joint force and full result of all.\n  Thus when we view some well-proportion'd dome,\n  (The world's just wonder, and ev'n thine, O Rome!)\n  No single parts unequally surprize,\n  All comes united to th' admiring eyes;                          250\n  No monstrous height, or breadth, or length appear;\n  The Whole at once is bold, and regular.\n\n  Whoever thinks a faultless piece to see,\n  Thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er shall be.\n  In every work regard the writer's End,                          255\n  Since none can compass more than they intend;\n  And if the means be just, the conduct true,\n  Applause, in spight of trivial faults, is due;\n  As men of breeding, sometimes men of wit,\n  T' avoid great errors, must the less commit:                    260\n  Neglect the rules each verbal Critic lays,\n  For not to know some trifles, is a praise.\n  Most Critics, fond of some subservient art,\n  Still make the Whole depend upon a Part:\n  They talk of principles, but notions prize,                     265\n  And all to one lov'd Folly sacrifice.\n\n  Once on a time, La Mancha's Knight, they say,\n  A certain bard encount'ring on the way,\n  Discours'd in terms as just, with looks as sage,\n  As e'er could Dennis of the Grecian stage;                      270\n  Concluding all were desp'rate sots and fools,\n  Who durst depart from Aristotle's rules.\n  Our Author, happy in a judge so nice,\n  Produc'd his Play, and begg'd the Knight's advice;\n  Made him observe the subject, and the plot,                     275\n  The manners, passions, unities; what not?\n  All which, exact to rule, were brought about,\n  Were but a Combat in the lists left out.\n  \"What! leave the Combat out?\" exclaims the Knight;\n  Yes, or we must renounce the Stagirite.                         280\n  \"Not so, by Heav'n\" (he answers in a rage),\n  \"Knights, squires, and steeds, must enter on the stage.\"\n  So vast a throng the stage can ne'er contain.\n  \"Then build a new, or act it in a plain.\"\n\n  Thus Critics, of less judgment than caprice,                    285\n  Curious not knowing, not exact but nice,\n  Form short Ideas; and offend in arts\n  (As most in manners) by a love to parts.\n\n  Some to _Conceit_ alone their taste confine,\n  And glitt'ring thoughts struck out at ev'ry line;               290\n  Pleas'd with a work where nothing's just or fit;\n  One glaring Chaos and wild heap of wit.\n  Poets like painters, thus, unskill'd to trace\n  The naked nature and the living grace,\n  With gold and jewels cover ev'ry part,                          295\n  And hide with ornaments their want of art.\n  True Wit is Nature to advantage dress'd,\n  What oft was thought, but ne'er so well express'd;\n  Something, whose truth convinc'd at sight we find,\n  That gives us back the image of our mind.                       300\n  As shades more sweetly recommend the light,\n  So modest plainness sets off sprightly wit.\n  For works may have more wit than does 'em good,\n  As bodies perish thro' excess of blood.\n\n  Others for Language all their care express,                     305\n  And value books, as women men, for Dress:\n  Their praise is still--the Style is excellent:\n  The Sense, they humbly take upon content.\n  Words are like leaves; and where they most abound,\n  Much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found,                    310\n  False Eloquence, like the prismatic glass,\n  Its gaudy colours spreads on ev'ry place;\n  The face of Nature we no more survey,\n  All glares alike, without distinction gay:\n  But true expression, like th' unchanging Sun,                   315\n  Clears and improves whate'er it shines upon,\n  It gilds all objects, but it alters none.\n  Expression is the dress of thought, and still\n  Appears more decent, as more suitable;\n  A vile conceit in pompous words express'd,                      320\n  Is like a clown in regal purple dress'd:\n  For diff'rent styles with diff'rent subjects sort,\n  As several garbs with country, town, and court.\n\n  Some by old words to fame have made pretence,\n  Ancients in phrase, mere moderns in their sense;                325\n  Such labour'd nothings, in so strange a style,\n  Amaze th' unlearn'd, and make the learned smile.\n  Unlucky, as Fungoso in the play,          }\n  These sparks with awkward vanity display  }\n  What the fine gentleman wore yesterday;   }                     330\n  And but so mimic ancient wits at best,\n  As apes our grandsires, in their doublets drest.\n  In words, as fashions, the same rule will hold;\n  Alike fantastic, if too new, or old:\n  Be not the first by whom the new are try'd,                     335\n  Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.\n\n  But most by Numbers judge a Poet's song;\n  And smooth or rough, with them is right or wrong:\n  In the bright Muse though thousand charms conspire,\n  Her voice is all these tuneful fools admire;                    340\n  Who haunt Parnassus but to please their ear,     }\n  Not mend their minds; as some to Church repair,  }\n  Not for the doctrine, but the music there.       }\n  These equal syllables alone require,\n  Tho' oft the ear the open vowe's tire;                          345\n  While expletives their feeble aid do join;\n  And ten low words oft creep in one dull line:\n  While they ring round the same unvary'd chimes,\n  With sure returns of still expected rhymes;\n  Where-e'er you find \"the cooling western breeze,\"               350\n  In the next line, it \"whispers through the trees:\"\n  If crystal streams \"with pleasing murmurs creep,\"\n  The reader's threaten'd (not in vain) with \"sleep:\"\n  Then, at the last and only couplet fraught\n  With some unmeaning thing they call a thought,                  355\n  A needless Alexandrine ends the song\n  That, like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along.\n  Leave such to tune their own dull rhymes, and know\n  What's roundly smooth or languishingly slow;\n  And praise the easy vigour of a line,                           360\n  Where Denham's strength, and Waller's sweetness join.\n  True ease in writing comes from art, not chance,\n  As those move easiest who have learn'd to dance.\n  'Tis not enough no harshness gives offence,\n  The sound must seem an Echo to the sense:                       365\n  Soft is the strain when Zephyr gently blows,\n  And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows;\n  But when loud surges lash the sounding shore,\n  The hoarse, rough verse should like the torrent roar:\n  When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw,             370\n  The line too labours, and the words move slow;\n  Not so, when swift Camilla scours the plain,\n  Flies o'er th' unbending corn, and skims along the main.\n  Hear how Timotheus' varied lays surprize,\n  And bid alternate passions fall and rise!                       375\n  While, at each change, the son of Libyan Jove\n  Now burns with glory, and then melts with love,\n  Now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow,\n  Now sighs steal out, and tears begin to flow:\n  Persians and Greeks like turns of nature found,                 380\n  And the world's victor stood subdu'd by Sound!\n  The pow'r of Music all our hearts allow,\n  And what Timotheus was, is DRYDEN now.\n\n  Avoid Extremes; and shun the fault of such,\n  Who still are pleas'd too little or too much.                   385\n  At ev'ry trifle scorn to take offence,\n  That always shows great pride, or little sense;\n  Those heads, as stomachs, are not sure the best,\n  Which nauseate all, and nothing can digest.\n  Yet let not each gay Turn thy rapture move;                     390\n  For fools admire, but men of sense approve:\n  As things seem large which we thro' mists descry,\n  Dulness is ever apt to magnify.\n\n  Some foreign writers, some our own despise;\n  The Ancients only, or the Moderns prize.                        395\n  Thus Wit, like Faith, by each man is apply'd\n  To one small sect, and all are damn'd beside.\n  Meanly they seek the blessing to confine,\n  And force that sun but on a part to shine,\n  Which not alone the southern wit sublimes,                      400\n  But ripens spirits in cold northern climes;\n  Which from the first has shone on ages past,\n  Enlights the present, and shall warm the last;\n  Tho' each may feel increases and decays,\n  And see now clearer and now darker days.                        405\n  Regard not then if Wit be old or new,\n  But blame the false, and value still the true.\n\n  Some ne'er advance a Judgment of their own,\n  But catch the spreading notion of the Town;\n  They reason and conclude by precedent,                          410\n  And own stale nonsense which they ne'er invent.\n  Some judge of author's names, not works, and then\n  Nor praise nor blame the writings, but the men.\n  Of all this servile herd the worst is he\n  That in proud dulness joins with Quality,                       415\n  A constant Critic at the great man's board,\n  To fetch and carry nonsense for my Lord.\n  What woful stuff this madrigal would be,\n  In some starv'd hackney sonneteer, or me?\n  But let a Lord once own the happy lines,                        420\n  How the wit brightens! how the style refines!\n  Before his sacred name flies ev'ry fault,\n  And each exalted stanza teems with thought!\n\n  The Vulgar thus through Imitation err;\n  As oft the Learn'd by being singular;                           425\n  So much they scorn the crowd, that if the throng\n  By chance go right, they purposely go wrong;\n  So Schismatics the plain believers quit,\n  And are but damn'd for having too much wit.\n  Some praise at morning what they blame at night;                430\n  But always think the last opinion right.\n  A Muse by these is like a mistress us'd,\n  This hour she's idoliz'd, the next abus'd;\n  While their weak heads like towns unfortify'd,\n  'Twixt sense and nonsense daily change their side.              435\n  Ask them the cause; they're wiser still, they say;\n  And still to-morrow's wiser than to-day.\n  We think our fathers fools, so wise we grow,\n  Our wiser sons, no doubt, will think us so.\n  Once School-divines this zealous isle o'er-spread;

ST. JOHN LORD BOLINGBROKE\n\n\n\nTHE DESIGN\n\n\nHaving proposed to write some pieces on Human Life and Manners, such as\n(to use my Lord Bacon's expression) _come home to Men's Business and\nBosoms_, I thought it more satisfactory to begin with considering _Man_\nin the abstract, his _Nature_ and his _State_; since, to prove any moral\nduty, to enforce any moral precept, or to examine the perfection or\nimperfection of any creature whatsoever, it is necessary first to know\nwhat _condition_ and _relation_ it is placed in, and what is the proper\nend and purpose of its _being_.\n\nThe science of Human Nature is, like all other sciences, reduced to a\n_few clear points_: There are not _many certain truths_ in this world.\nIt is therefore in the Anatomy of the mind as in that of the Body; more\ngood will accrue to mankind by attending to the large, open, and\nperceptible parts, than by studying too much such finer nerves and\nvessels, the conformations and uses of which will for ever escape our\nobservation. The _disputes_ are all upon these last, and, I will venture\nto say, they have less sharpened the _wits_ than the _hearts_ of men\nagainst each other, and have diminished the practice, more than advanced\nthe theory of Morality. If I could flatter myself that this Essay has\nany merit, it is in steering betwixt the extremes of doctrines seemingly\nopposite, in passing over terms utterly unintelligible, and in forming a\n_temperate_ yet not _inconsistent_, and a _short_ yet not _imperfect_\nsystem of Ethics.\n\nThis I might have done in prose, but I chose verse, and even rhyme, for\ntwo reasons. The one will appear obvious; that principles, maxims, or\nprecepts so written, both strike the reader more strongly at first, and\nare more easily retained by him afterwards: The other may seem odd, but\nis true, I found I could express them more _shortly_ this way than in\nprose itself; and nothing is more certain, than that much of the _force_\nas well as _grace_ of arguments or instructions, depends on their\n_conciseness_. I was unable to treat this part of my subject more in\n_detail_, without becoming dry and tedious; or more _poetically_,\nwithout sacrificing perspicuity to ornament, without wandring from the\nprecision, or breaking the chain of reasoning: If any man can unite all\nthese without diminution of any of them, I freely confess he will\ncompass a thing above my capacity.\n\nWhat is now published, is only to be considered as a _general Map_ of\nMAN, marking out no more than the _greater parts_, their _extent_, their\n_limits_, and their _connection_, and leaving the particular to be more\nfully delineated in the charts which are to follow. Consequently, these\nEpistles in their progress (if I have health and leisure to make any\nprogress) will be less dry, and more susceptible of poetical ornament. I\nam here only opening the _fountains_, and clearing the passage. To\ndeduce the _rivers_, to follow them in their course, and to observe\ntheir effects, may be a task more agreeable.\n\nP.\n\n\n\n\n\nARGUMENT OF EPISTLE I\n\n\nOf the Nature and State of Man, with respect to the UNIVERSE.\n\n\n_Of_ Man _in the abstract_.\n\n\nI.   v. 17 &c.    _That we can judge only with regard to our_ own\n                  system, _being ignorant of the_ relations _of\n                  systems and things_.\n\nII.  v. 35, &c.   _That Man is not to be deemed_ imperfect, _but a Being\n                  suited to his_ place _and_ rank _in the creation,\n                  agreeable to the_ general Order _of things, and\n                  conformable to_ Ends _and_ Relations _to him unknown_.\n\nIII. v. 77, &c.   _That it is partly upon his_ ignorance _of_ future\n                  _events, and partly upon the_ hope _of a_ future\n                  _state, that all his happiness in the present\n                  depends_.\n\nIV.  v. 109, &c. _The_ pride _of aiming at more knowledge, and\n                 pretending to more Perfections, the cause of Man's\n                 error and misery.

JOHN! leave all meaner things\n        To low ambition, and the pride of Kings.\n        Let us (since Life can little more supply\n        Than just to look about us and to die)\n        Expatiate free o'er all this scene of Man;                  5\n        A mighty maze! but not without a plan;\n        A Wild, where weeds and flow'rs promiscuous shoot;\n        Or Garden, tempting with forbidden fruit.\n        Together let us beat this ample field,\n        Try what the open, what the covert yield;                  10\n        The latent tracts, the giddy heights, explore\n        Of all who blindly creep, or sightless soar;\n        Eye Nature's walks, shoot Folly as it flies,\n        And catch the Manners living as they rise;\n        Laugh where we must, be candid where we can;               15\n        But vindicate the ways of God to Man.\n\nI.      Say first, of God above, or Man below,\n        What can we reason, but from what we know?\n        Of Man, what see we but his station here,\n        From which to reason, or to which refer?                   20\n        Thro' worlds unnumber'd tho' the God be known,\n        'Tis ours to trace him only in our own.\n        He, who thro' vast immensity can pierce,\n        See worlds on worlds compose one universe,\n        Observe how system into system runs,                       25\n        What other planets circle other suns,\n        What vary'd Being peoples ev'ry star,\n        May tell why Heav'n has made us as we are.\n        But of this frame the bearings, and the ties,\n        The strong connexions, nice dependencies,                  30\n        Gradations just, has thy pervading soul\n        Look'd thro'? or can a part contain the whole?\n\n        Is the great chain, that draws all to agree,\n        And drawn supports, upheld by God, or thee?\n\nII.     Presumptuous Man! the reason wouldst thou find,            35\n        Why form'd so weak, so little, and so blind?\n        First, if thou canst, the harder reason guess,\n        Why form'd no weaker, blinder, and no less?\n        Ask of thy mother earth, why oaks are made\n        Taller or stronger than the weeds they shade?              40\n        Or ask of yonder argent fields above,\n        Why JOVE'S satellites are less than JOVE?\n\n        Of Systems possible, if 'tis confest\n        That Wisdom infinite must form the best,\n        Where all must full or not coherent be,                    45\n        And all that rises, rise in due degree;\n        Then, in the scale of reas'ning life, 'tis plain,\n        There must be, somewhere, such a rank as Man:\n        And all the question (wrangle e'er so long)\n        Is only this, if God has plac'd him wrong?                 50\n\n        Respecting Man, whatever wrong we call,\n        May, must be right, as relative to all.\n        In human works, tho' labour'd on with pain,\n        A thousand movements scarce one purpose gain;\n        In God's, one single can its end produce;                  55\n        Yet serves to second too some other use.\n        So Man, who here seems principal alone,\n        Perhaps acts second to some sphere unknown,\n        Touches some wheel, or verges to some goal;\n        'Tis but a part we see, and not a whole.                   60\n\n        When the proud steed shall know why Man restrains\n        His fiery course, or drives him o'er the plains:\n        When the dull Ox, why now he breaks the clod,\n        Is now a victim, and now \u00c3\u0086gypt's God:\n        Then shall Man's pride and dulness comprehend              65\n        His actions', passions', being's, use and end;\n        Why doing, suff'ring, check'd, impell'd; and why\n        This hour a slave, the next a deity.\n\n        Then say not Man's imperfect, Heav'n in fault;\n        Say rather, Man's as perfect as he ought:                  70\n        His knowledge measur'd to his state and place;\n        His time a moment, and a point his space.\n        If to be perfect in a certain sphere,\n        What matter, soon or late, or here or there?\n        The blest to day is as completely so,                      75\n        As who began a thousand years ago.\n\nIII.    Heav'n from all creatures hides the book of Fate,\n        All but the page prescrib'd, their present state:\n        From brutes what men, from men what spirits know:\n        Or who could suffer Being here below?                      80\n        The lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to-day,\n        Had he thy Reason, would he skip and play?\n        Pleas'd to the last, he crops the flow'ry food,\n        And licks the hand just rais'd to shed his blood.\n        Oh blindness to the future! kindly giv'n,                  85\n        That each may fill the circle mark'd by Heav'n:\n        Who sees with equal eye, as God of all,\n        A hero perish, or a sparrow fall,\n        Atoms or systems into ruin hurl'd,\n        And now a bubble burst, and now a world.                   90\n\n        Hope humbly then: with trembling pinions soar;\n        Wait the great teacher Death; and God adore.\n        What future bliss, he gives not thee to know,\n        But gives that Hope to be thy blessing now.\n        Hope springs eternal in the human breast:                  95\n        Man never Is, but always To be blest:\n        The soul, uneasy and confin'd from home,\n        Rests and expatiates in a life to come.\n\n        Lo, the poor Indian! whose untutor'd mind\n        Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind:             100\n        His soul, proud Science never taught to stray\n        Far as the solar walk, or milky way;\n        Yet simple Nature to his hope has giv'n,\n        Behind the cloud-topt hill, an humbler heav'n;\n        Some safer world in depth of woods embrac'd,              105\n        Some happier island in the watry waste,\n        Where slaves once more their native land behold,\n        No fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold.\n        To Be, contents his natural desire,\n        He asks no Angel's wing, no Seraph's fire;                110\n        But thinks, admitted to that equal sky,\n        His faithful dog shall bear him company.\n\nIV.     Go, wiser thou! and, in thy scale of sense,\n        Weight thy Opinion against Providence;\n        Call imperfection what thou fancy'st such,                115\n        Say, here he gives too little, there too much:\n        Destroy all Creatures for thy sport or gust,\n        Yet cry, If Man's unhappy, God's unjust;\n        If Man alone engross not Heav'n's high care,\n        Alone made perfect here, immortal there:                  120\n        Snatch from his hand the balance and the rod,\n        Re-judge his justice, be the God of God.\n        In Pride, in reas'ning Pride, our error lies;\n        All quit their sphere, and rush into the skies.\n\n        Pride still is aiming at the blest abodes,                125\n        Men would be Angels, Angels would be Gods.\n        Aspiring to be Gods, if Angels fell,\n        Aspiring to be Angels, Men rebel:\n        And who but wishes to invert the laws\n        Of ORDER, sins against th' Eternal Cause.                 130\n\nV.      Ask for what end the heav'nly bodies shine,\n        Earth for whose use? Pride answers, \"'Tis for mine:\n        For me kind Nature wakes her genial Pow'r,\n        Suckles each herb, and spreads out ev'ry flow'r;\n        Annual for me, the grape, the rose renew                  135\n        The juice nectareous, and the balmy dew;\n        For me, the mine a thousand treasures brings;\n        For me, health gushes from a thousand springs;\n        Seas roll to waft me, suns to light me rise;\n        My foot-stool earth, my canopy the skies.\"                140\n\n        But errs not Nature from his gracious end,\n        From burning suns when livid deaths descend,\n        When earthquakes swallow, or when tempests sweep\n        Towns to one grave, whole nations to the deep?\n        \"No, ('tis reply'd) the first Almighty Cause              145\n        Acts not by partial, but by gen'ral laws;\n        Th' exceptions few; some change since all began:\n        And what created perfect?\"--Why then Man?\n        If the great end be human Happiness,\n        Then Nature deviates; and can Man do less?                150\n        As much that end a constant course requires\n        Of show'rs and sun-shine, as of Man's desires;\n        As much eternal springs and cloudless skies,\n        As Men for ever temp'rate, calm, and wise.\n        If plagues or earthquakes break not Heav'n's design,      155\n        Why then a Borgia, or a Catiline?\n        Who knows but he, whose hand the lightning forms,\n        Who heaves old Ocean, and who wings the storms;\n        Pours fierce Ambition in a C\u00c3\u00a6sar's mind,\n        Or turns young Ammon loose to scourge mankind?            160\n        From pride, from pride, our very reas'ning springs;\n        Account for moral, as for nat'ral things:\n        Why charge we Heav'n in those, in these acquit?\n        In both, to reason right is to submit.\n\n        Better for Us, perhaps, it might appear,                  165\n        Were there all harmony, all virtue here;\n        That never air or ocean felt the wind;\n        That never passion discompos'd the mind.\n        But ALL subsists by elemental strife;\n        And Passions are the elements of Life.                    170\n        The gen'ral ORDER, since the whole began,\n        Is kept in Nature, and is kept in Man.\n\nVI.     What would this Man? Now upward will he soar,\n        And little less than Angel, would be more;\n        Now looking downwards, just as griev'd appears            175\n        To want the strength of bulls, the fur of bears.\n        Made for his use all creatures if he call,\n        Say what their use, had he the pow'rs of all?\n        Nature to these, without profusion, kind,\n        The proper organs, proper pow'rs assign'd;                180\n        Each seeming want compensated of course,\n        Here with degrees of swiftness, there of force;\n        All in exact proportion to the state;\n        Nothing to add, and nothing to abate.\n        Each beast, each insect, happy in its own:                185\n        Is Heav'n unkind to Man, and Man alone?\n        Shall he alone, whom rational we call,\n        Be pleas'd with nothing, if not bless'd with all?\n\n        The bliss of Man (could Pride that blessing find)\n        Is not to act or think beyond mankind;                    190\n        No pow'rs of body or of soul to share,\n        But what his nature and his state can bear.\n        Why has not Man a microscopic eye?\n        For this plain reason, Man is not a Fly.\n        Say what the use, were finer optics giv'n,                195\n        T' inspect a mite, not comprehend the heav'n?\n        Or touch, if tremblingly alive all o'er,\n        To smart and agonize at every pore?\n        Or quick effluvia darting thro' the brain,\n        Die of a rose in aromatic pain?                           200\n        If Nature thunder'd in his op'ning ears,\n        And stunn'd him with the music of the spheres,\n        How would he wish that Heav'n had left him still\n        The whisp'ring Zephyr, and the purling rill?\n        Who finds not Providence all good and wise,               205\n        Alike in what it gives, and what denies?\n\nVII.    Far as Creation's ample range extends,\n        The scale of sensual, mental pow'rs ascends:\n        Mark how it mounts, to Man's imperial race,\n        From the green myriads in the peopled grass:            210\n        What modes of sight betwixt each wide extreme,\n        The mole's dim curtain, and the lynx's beam:\n        Of smell, the headlong lioness between,\n        And hound sagacious on the tainted green:\n        Of hearing, from the life that fills the Flood,        215\n        To that which warbles thro' the vernal wood:\n        The spider's touch, how exquisitely fine!\n        Feels at each thread, and lives along the line:\n        In the nice bee, what sense so subtly true\n        From pois'nous herbs extracts the healing dew?         220\n        How Instinct varies in the grov'lling swine,\n        Compar'd, half-reas'ning elephant, with thine!\n        'Twixt that, and Reason, what a nice barrier,\n        For ever sep'rate, yet for ever near!\n        Remembrance and Reflection how ally'd;                 225\n        What thin partitions Sense from Thought divide:\n        And Middle natures, how they long to join,\n        Yet never pass th' insuperable line!\n        Without this just gradation, could they be\n        Subjected, these to those, or all to thee?             230\n        The pow'rs of all subdu'd by thee alone,\n        Is not thy Reason all these pow'rs in one?\n\nVIII.   See, thro' this air, this ocean, and this earth,\n        All matter quick, and bursting into birth.\n        Above, how high, progressive life may go!              235\n        Around, how wide! how deep extend below!\n        Vast chain of Being! which from God began,\n        Natures ethereal, human, angel, man,\n        Beast, bird, fish, insect, what no eye can see,\n        No glass can reach; from Infinite to thee,             240\n        From thee to Nothing.--On superior pow'rs\n        Were we to press, inferior might on ours:\n        Or in the full creation leave a void,\n        Where, one step broken, the great scale's destroy'd:\n        From Nature's chain whatever link you strike,          245\n        Tenth or ten thousandth, breaks the chain alike.\n\n        And, if each system in gradation roll\n        Alike essential to th' amazing Whole,\n        The least confusion but in one, not all\n        That system only, but the Whole must fall.             250\n        Let Earth unbalanc'd from her orbit fly,\n        Planets and Suns run lawless thro' the sky;\n        Let ruling Angels from their spheres be hurl'd,\n        Being on Being wreck'd, and world on world;\n        Heav'n's whole foundations to their centre nod,        255\n        And Nature tremble to the throne of God.\n        All this dread ORDER break--for whom? for thee?\n        Vile worm!--Oh Madness!

I had no\nthoughts of publishing it, till it pleased some Persons of Rank and\nFortune (the Authors of _Verses to the Imitator of Horace_, and of an\n_Epistle to a Doctor of Divinity from a Nobleman at Hampton Court_) to\nattack, in a very extraordinary manner, not only my Writings (of which,\nbeing public, the Public is judge), but my P_erson, Morals_, and\n_Family_, whereof, to those who know me not, a truer information may be\nrequisite. Being divided between the necessity to say something of\n_myself_, and my own laziness to undertake so awkward a task, I thought\nit the shortest way to put the last hand to this Epistle. If it have any\nthing pleasing, it will be that by which I am most desirous to please,\nthe _Truth_ and the _Sentiment_; and if any thing offensive, it will be\nonly to those I am least sorry to offend, _the vicious_ or _the\nungenerous_.\n\nMany will know their own pictures in it, there being not a circumstance\nbut what is true; but I have, for the most part, spared their _Names_,\nand they may escape being laughed at, if they please.\n\nI would have some of them know, it was owing to the request of the\nlearned and candid Friend to whom it is inscribed, that I make not as\nfree use of theirs as they have done of mine. However, I shall have this\nadvantage, and honour, on my side, that whereas, by their proceeding,\nany abuse may be directed at any man, no injury can possibly be done by\nmine, since a nameless character can never be found out, but by its\n_truth_ and _likeness_.\n\nP.\n\n\n\n\n\n  P. shut, shut the door, good John! fatigu'd, I said,\n  Tie up the knocker, say I'm sick, I'm dead.\n  The Dog-star rages! nay't is past a doubt,\n  All Bedlam, or Parnassus, is let out:\n  Fire in each eye, and papers in each hand,                        5\n  They rave, recite, and madden round the land.\n\n  What walls can guard me, or what shade can hide?\n  They pierce my thickets, thro' my Grot they glide;\n  By land, by water, they renew the charge;\n  They stop the chariot, and they board the barge.                 10\n  No place is sacred, not the Church is free;\n  Ev'n Sunday shines no Sabbath-day to me;\n  Then from the Mint walks forth the Man of rhyme,\n  Happy to catch me just at Dinner-time.\n\n  Is there a Parson, much bemus'd in beer,                         15\n  A maudlin Poetess, a rhyming Peer,\n  A Clerk, foredoom'd his father's soul to cross,\n  Who pens a Stanza, when he should _engross_?\n  Is there, who, lock'd from ink and paper, scrawls\n  With desp'rate charcoal round his darken'd walls?                20\n  All fly to TWIT'NAM, and in humble strain\n  Apply to me, to keep them mad or vain.\n  Arthur, whose giddy son neglects the Laws,\n  Imputes to me and my damn'd works the cause:\n  Poor Cornus sees his frantic wife elope,                         25\n  And curses Wit, and Poetry, and Pope.\n\n  Friend to my Life!

A fortunate chance threw in his\nway a subject exactly suited to his tastes and powers. He seized upon\nit, dashed off his first sketch in less than a fortnight, and published\nit anonymously in a 'Miscellany' issued by Lintot in 1712. But the theme\nhad taken firm root in his mind. Dissatisfied with his first treatment\nof it, he determined, against the advice of the best critic of the day,\nto recast the work, and lift it from a mere society 'jeu d'esprit' into\nan elaborate mock-heroic poem. He did so and won a complete success.\nEven yet, however, he was not completely satisfied and from time to time\nhe added a touch to his work until he finally produced the finished\npicture which we know as 'The Rape of the Lock'. As it stands, it is an\nalmost flawless masterpiece, a brilliant picture and light-hearted\nmockery of the gay society of Queen Anne's day, on the whole the most\nsatisfactory creation of Pope's genius, and, perhaps, the best example\nof the mock-heroic in any literature.\n\nThe occasion which gave rise to 'The Rape of the Lock' has been so often\nrelated that it requires only a brief restatement. Among the Catholic\nfamilies of Queen Anne's day, who formed a little society of their own,\nMiss Arabella Fermor was a reigning belle. In a youthful frolic which\noverstepped the bounds of propriety Lord Petre, a young nobleman of her\nacquaintance, cut off a lock of her hair. The lady was offended, the two\nfamilies took up the quarrel, a lasting estrangement, possibly even a\nduel, was threatened. At this juncture a common friend of the two\nfamilies, a Mr. Caryll, nephew of a well-known Jacobite exile for whom\nhe is sometimes mistaken, suggested to Pope \"to write a poem to make a\njest of it,\" and so kill the quarrel with laughter. Pope consented,\nwrote his first draft of 'The Rape of the Lock', and passed it about in\nmanuscript. Pope says himself that it had its effect in the two\nfamilies; certainly nothing more is heard of the feud. How Miss Fermor\nreceived the poem is a little uncertain. Pope complains in a letter\nwritten some months after the poem had appeared in print that \"the\ncelebrated lady is offended.\" According to Johnson she liked the verses\nwell enough to show them to her friends, and a niece of hers said years\nafterward that Mr. Pope's praise had made her aunt \"very troublesome and\nconceited.\" It is not improbable that Belinda was both flattered and\noffended. Delighted with the praise of her beauty she may none the less\nhave felt called upon to play the part of the offended lady when the\npoem got about and the ribald wits of the day began to read into it\ndouble meanings which reflected upon her reputation. To soothe her\nruffled feelings Pope dedicated the second edition of the poem to her in\na delightful letter in which he thanked her for having permitted the\npublication of the first edition to forestall an imperfect copy offered\nto a bookseller, declared that the character of Belinda resembled her in\nnothing but in beauty, and affirmed that he could never hope that his\npoem should pass through the world half so uncensured as she had done.\nIt would seem that the modern critics who have undertaken to champion\nMiss Fermor against what they are pleased to term the revolting behavior\nof the poet are fighting a needless battle. A pretty girl who would long\nsince have been forgotten sat as an unconscious model to a great poet;\nhe made her the central figure in a brilliant picture and rendered her\nname immortal. That is the whole story, and when carping critics begin\nto search the poem for the improprieties of conduct to which they say\nPope alluded, one has but to answer in Pope's own words.\n\n  If to her share some female errors fall,\n  Look on her face, and you'll forget 'em all.\n\nPope's statement in the dedication that he had been forced into\npublishing the first draft of the poem before his design of enlarging it\nwas half executed is probably to be taken, like many of his statements,\nwith a sufficient grain of salt. Pope had a curious habit of protesting\nthat he was forced into publishing his letters, poems, and other\ntrifles, merely to forestall the appearance of unauthorized editions. It\nis more likely that it was the undoubted success of 'The Rape of the\nLock' in its first form which gave him the idea of working up the sketch\ninto a complete mock-heroic poem.\n\nExamples of such a poem were familiar enough to Pope. Not to go back to\nthe pseudo-Homeric mock epic which relates the battle of the frogs and\nmice, Vida in Italy and Boileau in France, with both of whom Pope, as\nthe 'Essay on Criticism' shows, was well acquainted, had done work of\nthis kind. Vida's description of the game of chess in his 'Scacchia\nLudus' certainly gave him the model for the game of ombre in the third\ncanto of 'The Rape of the Lock'; Boileau's 'Lutrin' probably suggested\nto him the idea of using the mock-heroic for the purposes of satire.\n\nNow it was a dogma of the critical creed of the day, which Pope devoutly\naccepted, that every epic must have a well-recognized \"machinery.\"\nMachinery, as he kindly explained to Miss Fermor, was a \"term invented\nby the critics to signify that part which the deities, angels, or demons\nare made to act in a poem,\" in short for the whole supernatural element.\nSuch machinery was quite wanting in the first draft of the Rape; it must\nbe supplied if the poem was to be a true epic, even of the comic kind.\nAnd the machinery must be of a nature which would lend itself to the\nlight satiric tone of the poem. What was it to be? The employment of\nwhat we may call Christian machinery, the angels and devils of Tasso and\nMilton, was, of course, out of the question. The employment of the\nclassic machinery was almost as impossible. It would have been hard for\nsuch an admirer of the classics as Pope to have taken the deities of\nOlympus otherwise than seriously. And even if he had been able to treat\nthem humorously, the humor would have been a form of burlesque quite at\nvariance with what he had set out to accomplish. For Pope's purpose,\nspringing naturally from the occasion which set him to writing the\n'Rape', was not to burlesque what was naturally lofty by exhibiting it\nin a degraded light, but to show the true littleness of the trivial by\ntreating it in a grandiose and mock-heroic fashion, to make the quarrel\nover the stolen lock ridiculous by raising it to the plane of the epic\ncontest before the walls of Troy.\n\nIn his perplexity a happy thought, little less in fact than an\ninspiration of genius, came to Pope. He had been reading a book by a\nclever French abb\u00c3\u00a9 treating in a satiric fashion of the doctrines of the\nso-called Rosicrucians, in particular of their ideas of elemental\nspirits and the influence of these spirits upon human affairs. Here was\nthe machinery he was looking for made to his hand. There would be no\nburlesque in introducing the Rosicrucian sylphs and gnomes into a\nmock-heroic poem, for few people, certainly not the author of the 'Comte\nde Gabalis', took them seriously. Yet the widespread popularity of this\nbook, to say nothing of the existence of certain Rosicrucian societies,\nhad rendered their names familiar to the society for which Pope wrote.\nHe had but to weave them into the action of his poem, and the brilliant\nlittle sketch of society was transformed into a true mock-epic.\n\nThe manner in which this interweaving was accomplished is one of the\nmost satisfactory evidences of Pope's artistic genius. He was proud of\nit himself. \"The making the machinery, and what was published before,\nhit so well together, is,\" he told Spencer, \"I think, one of the\ngreatest proofs of judgment of anything I ever did.\" And he might well\nbe proud. Macaulay, in a well-known passage, has pointed out how seldom\nin the history of literature such a recasting of a poem has been\nsuccessfully accomplished. But Pope's revision of 'The Rape of the Lock'\nwas so successful that the original form was practically done away with.\nNo one reads it now but professed students of the literature of Queen\nAnne's time. And so artfully has the new matter been woven into the old\nthat if the recasting of 'The Rape of the Lock' were not a commonplace\neven in school histories of English literature, not one reader in a\nhundred would suspect that the original sketch had been revised and\nenlarged to more than twice its length. It would be an interesting task\nfor the student to compare the two forms printed in this edition, to\nnote exactly what has been added, and the reasons for its addition, and\nto mark how Pope has smoothed the junctures and blended the old and the\nnew. Nothing that he could do would admit him more intimately to the\nsecrets of Pope's mastery of his art.\n\nA word must be said in closing as to the merits of 'The Rape of the\nLock' and its position in English literature. In the first place it is\nan inimitable picture of one phase, at least, of the life of the time,\nof the gay, witty, heartless society of Queen Anne's day. Slowly\nrecovering from the licentious excesses of the Restoration, society at\nthis time was perhaps unmoral rather than immoral. It was quite without\nideals, unless indeed the conventions of \"good form\" may be dignified by\nthat name. It lacked the brilliant enthusiasm of Elizabethan times as\nwell as the religious earnestness of the Puritans and the devotion to\npatriotic and social ideals which marked a later age. Nothing, perhaps,\nis more characteristic of the age than its attitude toward women. It\naffected indeed a tone of high-flown adoration which thinly veiled a\ncynical contempt. It styled woman a goddess and really regarded her as\nlittle better than a doll. The passion of love had fallen from the high\nestate it once possessed and become the mere relaxation of the idle\nmoments of a man of fashion.\n\nIn the comedies of Congreve, for example, a lover even if honestly in\nlove thinks it as incumbent upon him to make light of his passion before\nhis friends as to exaggerate it in all the forms of affected compliment\nbefore his mistress.\n\nIn 'The Rape of the Lock' Pope has caught and fixed forever the\natmosphere of this age. It is not the mere outward form and\ncircumstance, the manners and customs, the patching, powdering, ogling,\ngambling, of the day that he has reproduced, though his account of these\nwould alone suffice to secure the poem immortality as a contribution to\nthe history of society. The essential spirit of the age breathes from\nevery line. No great English poem is at once so brilliant and so empty,\nso artistic, and yet so devoid of the ideals on which all high art\nrests. It is incorrect, I think, to consider Pope in 'The Rape of the\nLock' as the satirist of his age. He was indeed clever enough to\nperceive its follies, and witty enough to make sport of them, but it is\nmuch to be doubted whether he was wise enough at this time to raise his\neyes to anything better. In the social satires of Pope's great admirer,\nByron, we are at no loss to perceive the ideal of personal liberty which\nthe poet opposes to the conventions he tears to shreds. Is it possible\nto discover in 'The Rape of the Lock' any substitute for Belinda's\nfancies and the Baron's freaks? The speech of Clarissa which Pope\ninserted as an afterthought to point the moral of the poem recommends\nBelinda to trust to merit rather than to charms. But \"merit\" is\nexplicitly identified with good humor, a very amiable quality, but\nhardly of the highest rank among the moral virtues. And the avowed end\nand purpose of \"merit\" is merely to preserve what beauty gains, the\nflattering attentions of the other sex,--surely the lowest ideal ever\nset before womankind. The truth is, I think, that 'The Rape of the Lock'\nrepresents Pope's attitude toward the social life of his time in the\nperiod of his brilliant youth. He was at once dazzled, amused, and\ndelighted by the gay world in which he found himself. The apples of\npleasure had not yet turned to ashes on his lips, and it is the poet's\nsympathy with the world he paints which gives to the poem the air, most\ncharacteristic of the age itself, of easy, idle, unthinking gayety. We\nwould not have it otherwise. There are sermons and satires in abundance\nin English literature, but there is only one 'Rape of the Lock'.\n\nThe form of the poem is in perfect correspondence with its spirit. There\nis an immense advance over the 'Essay on Criticism' in ease, polish, and\nbalance of matter and manner. And it is not merely in matters of detail\nthat the supremacy of the latter poem is apparent. 'The Rape of the\nLock' is remarkable among all Pope's longer poems as the one complete\nand perfect whole. It is no mosaic of brilliant epigrams, but an organic\ncreation. It is impossible to detach any one of its witty paragraphs and\nread it with the same pleasure it arouses when read in its proper\nconnection. Thalestris' call to arms and Clarissa's moral reproof are\nintegral parts of the poem. And as a result, perhaps, of its essential\nunity 'The Rape of the Lock' bears witness to the presence of a power in\nPope that we should hardly have suspected from his other works, the\npower of dramatic characterization. Elsewhere he has shown himself a\nmaster of brilliant portraiture, but Belinda, the Baron, and Thalestris\nare something more than portraits. They are living people, acting and\nspeaking with admirable consistency. Even the little sketch of Sir Plume\nis instinct with life.\n\nFinally 'The Rape of the Lock', in its limitations and defects, no less\nthan in its excellencies, represents a whole period of English poetry,\nthe period which reaches with but few exceptions from Dryden to\nWordsworth. The creed which dominated poetic composition during this\nperiod is discussed in the introduction to the Essay on Criticism, (see\np. 103) and is admirably illustrated in that poem itself. Its repression\nof individuality, its insistence upon the necessity of following in the\nfootsteps of the classic poets, and of checking the outbursts of\nimagination by the rules of common sense, simply incapacitated the poets\nof the period from producing works of the highest order. And its\ninsistence upon man as he appeared in the conventional, urban society of\nthe day as the one true theme of poetry, its belief that the end of\npoetry was to instruct and improve either by positive teaching or by\nnegative satire, still further limited its field. One must remember in\nattempting an estimate of 'The Rape of the Lock' that it was composed\nwith an undoubting acceptance of this creed and within all these\nnarrowing limitations. And when this is borne in mind, it is hardly too\nmuch to say that the poem attains the highest point possible. In its\ntreatment of the supernatural it is as original as a poem could be at\nthat day. The brilliancy of its picture of contemporary society could\nnot be heightened by a single stroke. Its satire is swift and keen, but\nnever ill natured. And the personality of Pope himself shines through\nevery line. Johnson advised authors who wished to attain a perfect style\nto give their days and nights to a study of Addison. With equal justice\none might advise students who wish to catch the spirit of our so-called\nAugustan age, and to realize at once the limitations and possibilities\nof its poetry, to devote themselves to the study of 'The Rape of the\nLock'.\n\n\n\n\nDEDICATION\n\n'Mrs. Arabella':\n\nthe title of Mrs. was still given in Pope's time to unmarried ladies as\nsoon as they were old enough to enter society.\n\n\n'the Rosicrucian doctrine':\n\nthe first mention of the Rosicrucians is in a book published in Germany\nin 1614, inviting all scholars to join the ranks of a secret society\nsaid to have been founded two centuries before by a certain Christian\nRosenkreuz who had mastered the hidden wisdom of the East. It seems\nprobable that this book was an elaborate hoax, but it was taken\nseriously at the time, and the seventeenth century saw the formation of\nnumerous groups of \"Brothers of the Rosy Cross.\" They dabbled in\nalchemy, spiritualism, and magic, and mingled modern science with\nsuperstitions handed down from ancient times. Pope probably knew nothing\nmore of them than what he had read in 'Le Comte de Gabalis'.\n\nThis was the work of a French abb\u00c3\u00a9, de Montfaucon Villars (1635-1673),\nwho was well known in his day both as a preacher and a man of letters.\nIt is really a satire upon the fashionable mystical studies, but treats\nin a tone of pretended seriousness of secret sciences, of elemental\nspirits, and of their intercourse with men. It was translated into\nEnglish in 1680 and again in 1714.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO I\n\nLines '1-2'\n\nPope opens his mock-epic with the usual epic formula, the statement of\nthe subject. Compare the first lines of the 'Iliad', the '\u00c3\u0086neid', and\n'Paradise Lost'. In l. 7 he goes on to call upon the \"goddess,\" i.e. the\nmuse, to relate the cause of the rape. This, too, is an epic formula.\nCompare '\u00c3\u0086neid', I, 8, and 'Paradise Lost', I, 27-33.\n\n\n'3 Caryl':\n\nsee Introduction, p. 83. In accordance with his wish his name was not\nprinted in the editions of the poem that came out in Pope's lifetime,\nappearing there only as C----or C----l.\n\n\n'4 Belinda':\n\na name used by Pope to denote Miss Fermor, the heroine of 'The Rape of\nthe Lock'.\n\n\n'12'\n\nThis line is almost a translation of a line in the '\u00c3\u0086neid' (I, 11),\nwhere Virgil asks if it be possible that such fierce passions (as\nJuno's) should exist in the minds of gods.\n\n\n'13 Sol':\n\na good instance of the fondness which Pope shared with most poets of his\ntime for giving classical names to objects of nature. This trick was\nsupposed to adorn and elevate poetic diction. Try to find other\ninstances of this in 'The Rape of the Lock'.\n\nWhy is the sun's ray called \"tim'rous\"?\n\n\n'16'\n\nIt was an old convention that lovers were so troubled by their passion\nthat they could not sleep. In the 'Prologue to the Canterbury Tales'\n(ll. 97-98), Chaucer says of the young squire:\n\n  So hote he lovede, that by nightertale\n  He sleep namore than dooth a nightingale.\n\nPope, of course, is laughing at the easy-going lovers of his day who in\nspite of their troubles sleep very comfortably till noon.\n\n\n'17'\n\nThe lady on awaking rang a little hand-bell that stood on a table by her\nbed to call her maid. Then as the maid did not appear at once she tapped\nimpatiently on the floor with the heel of her slipper. The watch in the\nnext line was a repeater.\n\n\n'19'\n\nAll the rest of this canto was added in the second edition of the poem.\nSee pp. 84-86. Pope did not notice that he describes Belinda as waking\nin I. 14 and still asleep and dreaming in ll. 19-116.\n\n\n'20 guardian Sylph':\n\ncompare ll. 67-78.\n\n\n'23 a Birth-night Beau':\n\na fine gentleman in his best clothes, such as he would wear at a ball on\nthe occasion of a royal birthday.\n\n\n'30'\n\nThe nurse would have told Belinda the old tales of fairies who danced by\nmoonlight on rings in the greensward, and dropped silver coins into the\nshoes of tidy little maids. The priest, on the other hand, would have\nrepeated to her the legend of St. Cecilia and her guardian angel who\nonce appeared in bodily form to her husband holding two rose garlands\ngathered in Paradise, or of St. Dorothea, who sent an angel messenger\nwith a basket of heavenly fruits and flowers to convert the pagan\nTheophilus.\n\n\n'42 militia':\n\nused here in the general sense of \"soldiery.\"\n\n\n'44 the box':\n\nin the theater.\n\n\n'the ring':\n\nthe drive in Hyde Park, where the ladies of society took the air.\n\n\n'46 a chair':\n\na sedan chair in which ladies used to be carried about. Why is Belinda\ntold to scorn it?\n\n\n'50'\n\nWhat is the meaning of \"vehicles\" in this line?\n\n\n'56 Ombre':\n\nthe fashionable game of cards in Pope's day. See his account of a game\nin Canto III and the notes on that passage.\n\n\n'57-67'\n\nSee 'Introduction', p. 85.\n\n\n'69-70'\n\nCompare 'Paradise Lost', I, 423-431.\n\n\n'79'\n\nconscious of their face: proud of their beauty.\n\n\n'81 These':\n\nthe gnomes who urge the vain beauties to disdain all offers of love and\nplay the part of prudes.\n\n\n'85 garters, stars, and coronets':\n\nthe garter is the badge of the Knights of the Garter, an order founded\nby Edward III, to which only noble princes and noblemen of the highest\nrank were admitted. \"Stars\" are the jeweled decorations worn by members\nof other noble orders. \"Coronets\" are the inferior crowns worn by\nprinces and nobles, not by sovereigns.\n\n\n'86 \"Your Grace\"':\n\nthe title bestowed in England on a duchess--The idea in this passage,\nll. 83-86, is that the gnomes fill the girls' minds with hopes of a\nsplendid marriage and so induce them to \"deny love.\"\n\n\n'94 impertinence':\n\npurposeless flirtation.\n\n\n'97-98 Florio ... Damon':\n\npoetic names for fine gentlemen; no special individuals are meant.\n\n\n'100' Why is a woman's heart called a \"toy-shop\"?\n\n\n'101 Sword-knots':\n\ntassels worn at the hilts of swords. In Pope's day every gentleman\ncarried a sword, and these sword-knots were often very gay.\n\n\n'105 who thy protection claim':\n\nwhat is the exact meaning of his phrase?\n\n\n'108 thy ruling Star':\n\nthe star that controls thy destinies, a reference to the old belief in\nastrology.\n\n\n'115 Shock':\n\nBelinda's pet dog. His name would seem to show that he was a\nrough-haired terrier.\n\n\n'118'\n\nDoes this line mean that Belinda had never seen a billet-doux before?\n\n\n'119 Wounds, Charms, and Ardors':\n\nthe usual language of a love-letter at this time.\n\n\n'124 the Cosmetic pow'rs':\n\nthe deities that preside over a lady's toilet. Note the playful satire\nwith which Pope describes Belinda's toilet as if it were a religious\nceremony. Who is \"th' inferior priestess\" in l. 127?\n\n\n'131 nicely':\n\ncarefully.\n\n\n'134 Arabia':\n\nfamous for its perfumes.\n\n\n'145 set the head':\n\narrange the head-dress.\n\n\n'147 Betty':\n\nBelinda's maid.\n\n\n\nCANTO II\n\n'4 Launch'd':\n\nembarked.\n\n\n'25 springes':\n\nsnares.\n\n\n'26 the finny prey':\n\na characteristic instance of Pope's preference or circumlocution to a\ndirect phrase.\n\n\n'35-36'\n\nA regular formula in classical epics. In Virgil (XI, 794-795) Phoebus\ngrants part of the prayer of Arruns; the other part he scatters to the\nlight winds.\n\n\n'38 vast French Romances':\n\nthese romances were the customary reading of society in Pope's day when\nthere were as yet no English novels. Some of them were of enormous\nlength. Addison found several of them in a typical lady's library, great\nfolio volumes, finely bound in gilt ('Spectator', 37).\n\n\n'58 All but the Sylph':\n\nso in Homer (1-25), while all the rest of the army is sleeping Agamemnon\nis disturbed by fear of the doom impending over the Greeks at the hands\nof Hector.\n\n\n'60 Waft':\n\nwave, or flutter.\n\n\n'70 Superior by the head':\n\nso in Homer ('Iliad', III, 225-227) Ajax is described as towering over\nthe other Greeks by head and shoulders.\n\n\n'73 sylphids':\n\na feminine form of \"sylphs.\"\n\n\n'74'\n\nThis formal opening of Ariel's address to his followers is a parody of a\npassage in 'Paradise Lost', V, 600-601.\n\n\n'75 spheres':\n\n\neither \"worlds\" or in a more general sense \"regions.\"\n\n'79'\n\nWhat are the \"wandering orbs,\" and how do they differ from planets in l.\n80?\n\n\n'97 a wash':\n\na lotion for the complexion.\n\n\n'105'\n\nDiana, the virgin huntress, was in a peculiar sense the goddess of\nchastity.\n\n\n'106 China jar':\n\nthe taste for collecting old china was comparatively new in England at\nthis time. It had been introduced from Holland by Queen Anne's sister,\nQueen Mary, and was eagerly caught up by fashionable society.\n\n\n'113 The drops':\n\nthe diamond earrings.\n\n\n'118 the Petticoat':\n\nthe huge hoop skirt which had recently become fashionable. Addison, in a\nhumorous paper in the 'Tatler' (No. 116), describes one as about\ntwenty-four yards in circumference.\n\n\n'128 bodkin':\n\na large needle.\n\n\n'133 rivel'd':\n\nan obsolete raiment of \"obrivelled.\"\n\n\n'133 Ixion':\n\naccording to classical mythology Ixion was punished for his sins by\nbeing bound forever upon a whirling wheel.\n\n\n'134 Mill':\n\nthe mill in which cakes of chocolate were ground up preparatory to\nmaking the beverage.\n\n\n'138 orb in orb':\n\nin concentric circles.\n\n\n'139 thrid':\n\na variant form of \"thread.\"\n\n\n\nCANTO III\n\n'3 a structure':\n\nHampton Court, a palace on the Thames, a few miles above London. It was\nbegun by Wolsey, and much enlarged by William III. Queen Anne visited it\noccasionally, and cabinet meetings were sometimes held there. Pope\ninsinuates (l. 6) that the statesmen who met in these councils were as\ninterested in the conquest of English ladies as of foreign enemies.\n\n\n'8'\n\nTea was still in Queen Anne's day a luxury confined to the rich. It\ncost, in 1710, from twelve to twenty-eight shillings per pound.\n\n\n'9 The heroes and the nymphs':\n\nthe boating party which started for Hampton Court in Canto II.\n\n\n'17'\n\nSnuff-taking had just become fashionable at this time. The practice is\nsaid to date from 1702, when an English admiral brought back fifty tons\nof snuff found on board some Spanish ships which he had captured in Vigo\nBay.\n\nIn the 'Spectator' for August 8, 1711, a mock advertisement is inserted\nprofessing to teach \"the exercise of the snuff-box according to the most\nfashionable airs and motions,\" and in the number for April 4, 1712,\nSteele protests against \"an impertinent custom the fine women have\nlately fallen into of taking snuff.\"\n\n\n'22 dine':\n\nthe usual dinner hour in Queen Anne's reign was about 3 P.M. Fashionable\npeople dined at 4, or later. This allowed the fashionable lady who rose\nat noon time to do a little shopping and perform \"the long labours of\nthe toilet.\"\n\n\n'26 two ... Knights':\n\none of these was the baron, see l. 66.\n\n\n'27 Ombre':\n\na game of cards invented in Spain. It takes its name from the Spanish\nphrase originally used by the player who declared trumps: \"Yo soy\nl'hombre,\" 'i.e.' I am the man. It could be played by three, five, or\nnine players, but the usual number was three as here. Each of these\nreceived nine cards, and one of them named the trump and thus became the\n\"ombre,\" who played against the two others. If either of the ombre's\nopponents took more tricks than the ombre, it was \"codille\" (l. 92).\nThis meant that the opponent took the stake and the ombre had to replace\nit for the next hand.\n\nA peculiar feature of ombre is the rank, or value, of the cards. The\nthree best cards were called \"matadores,\" a Spanish word meaning\n\"killers.\" The first of these matadores was \"Spadillio,\" the ace of\nspades; the third was \"Basto,\" the ace of clubs. The second, \"Manillio,\"\nvaried according to the suit. If a black suit were declared, Maniilio\nwas the two of trumps; if a red suit, Manillio was the seven of trumps.\nIt is worth noting also that the red aces were inferior to the face\ncards of their suits except when a red suit was trump.\n\nA brief analysis of the game played on this occasion will clear up the\npassage and leave the reader free to admire the ingenuity with which\nPope has described the contest in terms of epic poetry.\n\nBelinda declares spades trumps and so becomes the \"ombre.\" She leads one\nafter the other the three matadores; and takes three tricks. She then\nleads the next highest card, the king of spades, and wins a fourth\ntrick. Being out of trumps she now leads the king of clubs; but the\nbaron, who has actually held more spades than Belinda, trumps it with\nthe queen of spades. All the trumps are now exhausted and the baron's\nlong suit of diamonds is established. He takes the sixth, seventh, and\neighth tricks with the king, queen, and knave of diamonds, respectively.\nEverything now depends on the last trick, since Belinda and the baron\neach have taken four. The baron leads the ace of hearts and Belinda\ntakes it with the king, thus escaping \"codille\" and winning the stake.\n\n\n'30 the sacred nine':\n\nthe nine Muses.\n\n\n'41 succint':\n\ntucked up.\n\n\n'54 one Plebeian card':\n\none of Belinda's opponents is now out of trumps and discards a low card\non her lead.\n\n\n'61 Pam':\n\na term applied to the knave of clubs which was always the highest card\nin Lu, another popular game of that day.\n\n\n'74 the globe':\n\nthe jeweled ball which forms one of the regalia of a monarch. The aspect\nof playing cards has changed not a little since Pope's day, but the\nglobe is still to be seen on the king of clubs.\n\n\n'79 Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts':\n\nthese are the losing cards played by Belinda and the third player on the\nbaron's winning diamonds.\n\n\n'99'\n\nPope's old enemy, Dennis, objected to the impropriety of Belinda's\nfilling the sky with exulting shouts, and some modern critics have been\nfoolish enough to echo his objection. The whole scene is a masterpiece\nof the mock-heroic. The game is a battle, the cards are warriors, and\nBelinda's exclamations of pleasure at winning are in the same fashion\nmagnified into the cheers of a victorious army.\n\n\n'100 long canals':\n\nthe canals which run through the splendid gardens of Hampton Court, laid\nout by William III in the Dutch fashion.\n\n\n'106 The berries crackle':\n\nit would seem from this phrase that coffee was at that time roasted as\nwell as ground in the drawing-room. In a letter written shortly after\nthe date of this poem Pope describes Swift as roasting coffee \"with his\nown hands in an engine made for that purpose.\"\n\nCoffee had been introduced into England about the middle of the\nseventeenth century. In 1657 a barber who had opened one of the first\ncoffeehouses in London was indicted for \"making and selling a sort of\nliquor called coffee, as a great nuisance and prejudice of the\nneighborhood.\" In Pope's time there were nearly three thousand\ncoffee-houses in London.\n\n\n'The mill':\n\nthe coffee-mill.\n\n\n'107 Altars of Japan':\n\njapanned stands for the lamps.\n\n\n'117-118'\n\nThe parenthesis in these lines contains a hit at the would-be omniscient\npoliticians who haunted the coffee-houses of Queen Anne's day, and who\nprofessed their ability to see through all problems of state with their\neyes half-shut. Pope jestingly attributes their wisdom to the inspiring\npower of coffee.\n\n\n'122 Scylla':\n\nthe daughter of King Nisus in Grecian legends. Nisus had a purple hair\nand so long as it was untouched he was unconquerable. Scylla fell in\nlove with one of his enemies and pulled out the hair while Nisus slept.\nFor this crime she was turned into a bird. The story is told in full in\nOvid's 'Metamorphoses', Bk. VIII.\n\n\n'127 Clarissa':\n\nit does not appear that Pope had any individual lady in mind. We do not\nknow, at least, that any lady instigated or aided Lord Petre to cut off\nthe lock.\n\n\n'144 An earthly Lover':\n\nwe know nothing of any love affair of Miss Fermor's. Pope mentions the\n\"earthly lover\" here to account for Ariel's desertion of Belinda, for he\ncould only protect her so long as she \"rejected mankind\"; compare Canto\nI, ll. 67-68.\n\n\n'147 Forfex':\n\na Latin word meaning scissors.\n\n\n'152'\n\nPope borrowed this idea from Milton, who represents the wound inflicted\non Satan, by the Archangel Michael as healing immediately--\n\n  Th' ethereal substance closed\n  Not long divisible.\n\n--'Paradise Lost', VI, 330-331.\n\n\n'165 Atalantis': 'The New Atalantis',\n\na four-volume \"cornucopia of scandal\" involving almost every public\ncharacter of the day, was published by a Mrs. Manley in 1709. It was\nvery widely read. The Spectator found it, along with a key which\nrevealed the identities of its characters, in the lady's library already\nmentioned ('Spectator', No. 37).\n\n\n'166 the small pillow':\n\na richly decorated pillow which fashionable ladies used to prop them up\nin bed when they received morning visits from gentlemen. Addison gives\nan account of such a visit in the 'Spectator', No. 45.\n\n\n'167 solemn days':\n\ndays of marriage or mourning, on which at this time formal calls were\npaid.\n\n\n'173 the labour of the gods':\n\nthe walls of Troy built by Apollo and Neptune for King Laomedon.\n\n\n'178 unresisted':\n\nirresistible.\n\n\n\nCANTO IV\n\n'8 Cynthia':\n\na fanciful name for any fashionable lady. No individual is meant.\n\n'manteau':\n\na loose upper garment for women.\n\n\n'16 Spleen':\n\nthe word is used here as a personification of melancholy, or low\nspirits. It was not an uncommon affectation in England at this time. A\nletter to the 'Spectator', No. 53, calls it \"the distemper of the great\nand the polite.\"\n\n\n'17 the Gnome':\n\nUmbriel, who in accordance with his nature now proceeds to stir up\ntrouble. Compare Canto I, ll. 63-64.\n\n\n'20'\n\nThe bitter east wind which put every one into a bad humor was supposed\nto be one of the main causes of the spleen.\n\n\n'23 She':\n\nthe goddess of the spleen. Compare l. 79.\n\n\n'84 Megrim':\n\nheadache.\n\n\n'29 store':\n\na large supply.\n\n\n'38 night-dress':\n\nthe modern dressing-gown. The line means that whenever a fashionable\nbeauty bought a new dressing-gown she pretended to be ill in order to\nshow her new possession to sympathetic friends who called on her.\n\n\n'40 phantoms':\n\nthese are the visions, dreadful or delightful, of the disordered\nimagination produced by spleen.\n\n\n'43 snakes on rolling spires':\n\nlike the serpent which Milton describes in 'Paradise Lost', IX, 501-502,\n\"erect amidst his circling spires.\"\n\n\n'46 angels in machines':\n\nangels coming to help their votaries. The word \"machine\" here has an\nold-fashioned technical sense. It was first used to describe the\napparatus by which a god was let down upon the stage of the Greek\ntheater. Since a god was only introduced at a critical moment to help\nthe distressed hero, the phrase, \"deus ex machina,\" came to mean a god\nwho rendered aid. Pope transfers it here to angels.\n\n\n'47 throngs':\n\nPope now describes the mad fancies of people so affected by spleen as to\nimagine themselves transformed to inanimate objects.\n\n\n'51 pipkin':\n\na little jar. Homer ('Iliad', XVIII, 373-377) tells how Vulcan had made\ntwenty wonderful tripods on living wheels that moved from place to place\nof their own accord.\n\n\n'52'\n\nPope in a note to this poem says that a lady of his time actually\nimagined herself to be a goose-pie.\n\n\n'56 A branch':\n\nso \u00c3\u0086neas bore a magic branch to protect him when he descended to the\ninfernal regions ('\u00c3\u0086neid', VI, 136-143).\n\n'Spleenwort':\n\na sort of fern which was once supposed to be a remedy against the spleen.\n\n\n'58 the sex':\n\nwomen.\n\n\n'59 vapours':\n\na form of spleen to which women were supposed to be peculiarly liable,\nsomething like our modern hysteria. It seems to have taken its name from\nthe fogs of England which were thought to cause it.\n\n\n'65 a nymph':\n\nBelinda, who had always been so light-hearted that she had never been a\nvictim of the spleen.\n\n\n'89 Citron-waters':\n\na liqueur made by distilling brandy with the rind of citrons. It was a\nfashionable drink for ladies at this time.\n\n\n'71'\n\nMade men suspicious of their wives.\n\n\n'82 Ulysses':\n\nHomer ('Odyssey', X, 1-25) tells how \u00c3\u0086olus, the god of the winds, gave\nUlysses a wallet of oxhide in which all the winds that might oppose his\njourney homeward were closely bound up.\n\n\n'89 Thalestris':\n\nthe name of a warlike queen of the Amazons. Pope uses it here for a\nfriend of Belinda's, who excites her to revenge herself for the rape of\nher lock. It is said that this friend was a certain Mrs. Morley.\n\n\n'102 loads of lead':\n\ncurl papers used to be fastened with strips of lead.\n\n\n'105 Honour':\n\nfemale reputation.\n\n\n'109 toast':\n\na slang term in Pope's day for a reigning beauty whose health was\nregularly drunk by her admirers. Steele ('Tatler', No. 24) says that the\nterm had its rise from an accident that happened at Bath in the reign of\nCharles II. A famous beauty was bathing there in public, and one of her\nadmirers filled a glass with the water in which she stood and drank her\nhealth.\n\n  \"There was in the place,\" says Steele \"a gay fellow, half-fuddled, who\n  offered to jump in, and swore though he liked not the liquor, he would\n  have the Toast. He was opposed in his resolution; yet this whim gave\n  foundation to the present honor which is done to the lady we mention\n  in our liquors, who has ever since been called a TOAST.\"\n\nTo understand the point of the story one must know that it was an old\ncustom to put a bit of toast in hot drinks.\n\nIn this line in the poem Thalestris insinuates that if Belinda submits\ntamely to the rape of the lock, her position as a toast will be\nforfeited.\n\n\n'113-116'\n\nThalestris supposes that the baron will have the lock set in a ring\nunder a bit of crystal. Old-fashioned hair-rings of this kind are still\nto be seen.\n\n\n'117 Hyde-park Circus':\n\nthe Ring of Canto I, l. 44. Grass was not likely to grow there so long\nas it remained the fashionable place to drive.\n\n\n'118 in the sound of Bow':\n\nwithin hearing of the bells of the church of St. Mary le Bow in\nCheapside. So far back as Ben Jonson's time (Eastward Ho, I, ii, 36) it\nwas the mark of the unfashionable middle-class citizen to live in this\nquarter. A \"wit\" in Queen Anne's day would have scorned to lodge there.\n\n\n'121 Sir Plume':\n\nthis was Sir George Brown, brother of Mrs. Morley (Thalestris). He was\nnot unnaturally offended at the picture drawn of him in this poem. Pope\ntold a friend many years later that\n\n  \"nobody was angry but Sir George Brown, and he was a good deal so, and\n  for a long time. He could not bear that Sir Plume should talk nothing\n  but nonsense.\"\n\n\n'124 a clouded cane':\n\na cane of polished wood with cloudlike markings. In the 'Tatler', Mr.\nBickerstaff sits in judgment on canes, and takes away a cane, \"curiously\nclouded, with a transparent amber head, and a blue ribband to hang upon\nhis wrist,\" from a young gentleman as a piece of idle foppery. There are\nsome amusing remarks on the \"conduct\" of canes in the same essay.\n\n\n'133'\n\nThe baron's oath is a parody of the oath of Achilles ('Iliad', I, 234).\n\n\n'142'\n\nThe breaking of the bottle of sorrows, etc., is the cause of Belinda's\nchange of mood from wrath as in l. 93 to tears, 143-144.\n\n\n'155 the gilt Chariot':\n\nthe painted and gilded coach in which ladies took the air in London.\n\n\n'156 Bohea:'\n\ntea, the name comes from a range of hills in China where a certain kind\nof tea was grown.\n\n\n'162 the patch-box:'\n\nthe box which held the little bits of black sticking-plaster with which\nladies used to adorn their faces. According to Addison ('Spectator', No.\n81), ladies even went so far in this fad as to patch on one side of the\nface or the other, according to their politics.\n\n\n\n\nCANTO V\n\n'5 the Trojan:'\n\n\u00c3\u0086neas, who left Carthage in spite of the wrath of Dido and the\nentreaties of her sister Anna.\n\n\n'7-36'\n\nPope inserted these lines in a late revision in 1717, in order, as he\nsaid, to open more clearly the moral of the poem. The speech of Clarissa\nis a parody of a famous speech by Sarpedon in the 'Iliad', XII, 310-328.\n\n\n'14'\n\nAt this time the gentlemen always sat in the side boxes of the theater;\nthe ladies in the front boxes.\n\n\n'20'\n\nAs vaccination had not yet been introduced, small-pox was at this time a\nterribly dreaded scourge.\n\n\n'23'\n\nIn the 'Spectator', No. 23, there is inserted a mock advertisement,\nprofessing to teach the whole art of ogling, the church ogle, the\nplayhouse ogle, a flying ogle fit for the ring, etc.\n\n\n'24'\n\nPainting the face was a common practice of the belles of this time. 'The\nSpectator', No. 41, contains a bitter attack on the painted ladies whom\nit calls the \"Picts.\"\n\n\n'37 virago:'\n\na fierce, masculine woman, here used for Thalestris.\n\n\n'45'\n\nIn the 'Iliad' (Bk. XX) the gods are represented as taking sides for the\nGreeks and Trojans and fighting among themselves. Pallas opposes Ares,\nor Mars; and Hermes, Latona.\n\n\n'48 Olympus:'\n\nthe hill on whose summit the gods were supposed to dwell, often used for\nheaven itself.\n\n\n'50 Neptune:'\n\nused here for the sea over which Neptune presided.\n\n\n'53 a sconce's height:'\n\nthe top of an ornamental bracket for holding candles.\n\n\n'61'\n\nExplain the metaphor in this line.\n\n\n'64'\n\nThe quotation is from a song in an opera called 'Camilla'.\n\n\n'65'\n\nThe M\u00c3\u00a6ander is a river in Asia Minor. Ovid ('Heroides', VII, 1-2)\nrepresents the swan as singing his death-song on its banks.\n\n\n'68'\n\nChloe: a fanciful name. No real person is meant.\n\n\n'71'\n\nThe figure of Jove weighing the issue of a battle in his scales is found\nin the 'Iliad', VIII, 69-73. Milton imitated it in 'Paradise Lost', IX,\n996-1004. When the men's wits mounted it showed that they were lighter,\nless important, than the lady's hair, and so were destined to lose the\nbattle.\n\n\n'89-96'\n\nThis pedigree of Belinda's bodkin is a parody of Homer's account of\nAgamemnon's scepter ('Iliad', II, 100-108).\n\n\n'105-106'\n\nIn Shakespeare's play Othello fiercely demands to see a handkerchief\nwhich he has given his wife, and takes her inability to show it to him\nas a proof of her infidelity.\n\n\n'113'\n\nthe lunar sphere: it was an old superstition that everything lost on\nearth went to the moon. An Italian poet, Ariosto, uses this notion in a\npoem with which Pope was familiar ('Orlando Furioso', Canto XXXIV), and\nfrom which he borrowed some of his ideas for the cave of Spleen.\n\n\n'122'\n\nWhy does Pope include \"tomes of casuistry\" in this collection?\n\n\n'125'\n\nThere was a legend that Romulus never died, but had been caught up to\nthe skies in a storm. Proculus, a Roman senator, said that Romulus had\ndescended from heaven and spoken to him and then ascended again (Livy,\nI, 16).\n\n\n'129' Berenice's Locks:\n\nBerenice was an Egyptian queen who dedicated a lock of hair for her\nhusband's safe return from war. It was said afterward to have become a\nconstellation, and a Greek poet wrote some verses on the marvel.\n\n\n'132'\n\nWhy were the Sylphs pleased?\n\n\n'133' the Mall:\n\nthe upper side of St. James's park in London, a favorite place at this\ntime for promenades.\n\n\n'136' Rosamonda's lake:\n\na pond near one of the gates of St. James's park, a favorite rendezvous\nfor lovers.\n\n\n'137' Partridge:\n\nan almanac maker of Pope's day who was given to prophesying future\nevents. Shortly before this poem was written Swift had issued a mock\nalmanac foretelling that Partridge would die on a certain day. When that\nday came Swift got out a pamphlet giving a full account of Partridge's\ndeath. In spite of the poor man's protests, Swift and his friends kept\non insisting that he was dead. He was still living, however, when Pope\nwrote this poem. Why does Pope call him \"th' egregious wizard\"?\n\n\n'138' Galileo's eyes:\n\nthe telescope, first used by the Italian astronomer Galileo.\n\n\n'140' Louis XIV of France,\n\nthe great enemy of England at this time\n\n'--Rome:'\n\nhere used to denote the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n\n'143 the shining sphere:'\n\nan allusion to the old notion that all the stars were set in one sphere\nin the sky. Belinda's lost lock, now a star, is said to add a new light\nto this sphere.\n\n\n147 What are the \"fair suns\"?\n\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\nAN ESSAY ON CRITICISM\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe 'Essay on Criticism' was the first really important work that Pope\ngave to the world. He had been composing verses from early boyhood, and\nhad actually published a set of 'Pastorals' which had attracted some\nattention. He was already known to the literary set of London\ncoffeehouses as a young man of keen wit and high promise, but to the\nreading public at large he was as yet an unknown quantity. With the\nappearance of the 'Essay', Pope not only sprang at once into the full\nlight of publicity, but seized almost undisputed that position as the\nfirst of living English poets which he was to retain unchallenged till\nhis death. Even after his death down to the Romantic revival, in fact,\nPope's supremacy was an article of critical faith, and this supremacy\nwas in no small measure founded upon the acknowledged merits of the\n'Essay on Criticism.' Johnson, the last great representative of Pope's\nown school of thought in matters literary, held that the poet had never\nexcelled this early work and gave it as his deliberate opinion that if\nPope had written nothing else, the 'Essay' would have placed him among\nthe first poets and the first critics. The 'Essay on Criticism' is\nhardly an epoch-making poem, but it certainly \"made\" Alexander Pope.\n\nThe poem was published anonymously in the spring of 1711, when Pope was\ntwenty-three years old. There has been considerable dispute as to the\ndate of its composition; but the facts seem to be that it was begun in\n1707 and finished in 1709 when Pope had it printed, not for publication,\nbut for purposes of further correction. As it stands, therefore, it\nrepresents a work planned at the close of Pope's precocious youth, and\nexecuted and polished in the first flush of his manhood. And it is quite\nfair to say that considering the age of its author the 'Essay on\nCriticism' is one of the most remarkable works in English.\n\nNot that there is anything particularly original about the 'Essay.' On\nthe contrary, it is one of the most conventional of all Pope's works. It\nhas nothing of the lively fancy of 'The Rape of the Lock', little or\nnothing of the personal note which stamps the later satires and epistles\nas so peculiarly Pope's own. Apart from its brilliant epigrammatic\nexpression the 'Essay on Criticism' might have been written by almost\nany man of letters in Queen Anne's day who took the trouble to think a\nlittle about the laws of literature, and who thought about those laws\nstrictly in accordance with the accepted conventions of his time. Pope\nis not in the least to be blamed for this lack of originality. Profound\noriginal criticism is perhaps the very last thing to be expected of a\nbrilliant boy, and Pope was little more when he planned this work. But\nboy as he was, he had already accomplished an immense amount of\ndesultory reading, not only in literature proper, but in literary\ncriticism as well. He told Spence in later years that in his youth he\nhad gone through all the best critics, naming especially Quintilian,\nRapin, and Bossu. A mere cursory reading of the Essay shows that he had\nalso studied Horace, Vida, and Boileau. Before he began to write he had,\nso he told Spence, \"digested all the matter of the poem into prose.\" In\nother words, then, the 'Essay on Criticism' is at once the result of\nPope's early studies, the embodiment of the received literary doctrines\nof his age, and, as a consecutive study of his poems shows, the\nprogramme in accordance with which, making due allowance for certain\nexceptions and inconsistencies, he evolved the main body of his work.\n\nIt would, however, be a mistake to treat, as did Pope's first editor,\nthe 'Essay on Criticism' as a methodical, elaborate, and systematic\ntreatise. Pope, indeed, was flattered to have a scholar of such\nrecognized authority as Warburton to interpret his works, and permitted\nhim to print a commentary upon the 'Essay', which is quite as long and\ninfinitely duller than the original. But the true nature of the poem is\nindicated by its title. It is not an 'Art of Poetry' such as Boileau\ncomposed, but an 'Essay'. And by the word \"essay,\" Pope meant exactly\nwhat Bacon did,--a tentative sketch, a series of detached thoughts upon\na subject, not a complete study or a methodical treatise. All that we\nknow of Pope's method of study, habit of thought, and practice of\ncomposition goes to support this opinion. He read widely but\ndesultorily; thought swiftly and brilliantly, but illogically and\ninconsistently; and composed in minute sections, on the backs of letters\nand scraps of waste paper, fragments which he afterward united, rather\nthan blended, to make a complete poem, a mosaic, rather than a picture.\n\nYet the 'Essay' is by no means the \"collection of independent maxims\ntied together by the printer, but having no natural order,\" which De\nQuincey pronounced it to be. It falls naturally into three parts. The\nfirst deals with the rules derived by classic critics from the practice\nof great poets, and ever since of binding force both in the composition\nand in the criticism of poetry. The second analyzes with admirable\nsagacity the causes of faulty criticism as pride, imperfect learning,\nprejudice, and so on. The third part discusses the qualities which a\ntrue critic should possess, good taste, learning, modesty, frankness,\nand tact, and concludes with a brief sketch of the history of criticism\nfrom Aristotle to Walsh. This is the general outline of the poem,\nsufficient, I think, to show that it is not a mere bundle of poetic\nformulae. But within these broad limits the thought of the poem wanders\nfreely, and is quite rambling, inconsistent, and illogical enough to\nshow that Pope is not formulating an exact and definitely determined\nsystem of thought.\n\nSuch indeed was, I fancy, hardly his purpose. It was rather to give\nclear, vivid, and convincing expression to certain ideas which were at\nthat time generally accepted as orthodox in the realm of literary\ncriticism. No better expression of these ideas can be found anywhere\nthan in the 'Essay' itself, but a brief statement in simple prose of\nsome of the most important may serve as a guide to the young student of\nthe essay.\n\nIn the first place, the ultimate source alike of poetry and criticism is\na certain intuitive faculty, common to all men, though more highly\ndeveloped in some than others, called Reason, or, sometimes, Good Sense.\nThe first rule for the budding poet or critic is \"Follow Nature.\" This,\nby the way, sounds rather modern, and might be accepted by any romantic\npoet. But by \"Nature\" was meant not at all the natural impulses of the\nindividual, but those rules founded upon the natural and common reason\nof mankind which the ancient critics had extracted and codified from the\npractice of the ancient poets. Pope says explicitly \"to follow nature is\nto follow them;\" and he praises Virgil for turning aside from his own\noriginal conceptions to imitate Homer, for:\n\n  Nature and Homer were, he found, the same.\n\nCertain exceptions to these rules were, indeed, allowable,--severer\ncritics than Pope, by the way, absolutely denied this,--but only to the\nancient poets. The moderns must not dare to make use of them, or at the\nvery best moderns must only venture upon such exceptions to the rules as\nclassic precedents would justify. Inasmuch as all these rules were\ndiscovered and illustrated in ancient times, it followed logically that\nthe great breach with antiquity, which is called the Middle Ages, was a\nperiod of hopeless and unredeemed barbarism, incapable of bringing forth\nany good thing. The light of literature began to dawn again with the\nrevival of learning at the Renaissance, but the great poets of the\nRenaissance, Spenser and Shakespeare, for example, were \"irregular,\"\nthat is, they trusted too much to their individual powers and did not\naccept with sufficient humility the orthodox rules of poetry. This\ndogma, by the way, is hardly touched upon in the 'Essay', but is\nelaborated with great emphasis in Pope's later utterance on the\nprinciples of literature, the well-known 'Epistle to Augustus'. Finally\nwith the establishment of the reign of Reason in France under Louis XIV,\nand in England a little later, the full day had come, and literary sins\nof omission and commission that might be winked at in such an untutored\ngenius as Shakespeare were now unpardonable. This last dogma explains\nthe fact that in the brief sketch of the history of criticism which\nconcludes the 'Essay', Pope does not condescend to name an English poet\nor critic prior to the reign of Charles II.\n\nIt would be beside the purpose to discuss these ideas to-day or to\nattempt an elaborate refutation of their claims to acceptance. Time has\ndone its work upon them, and the literary creed of the wits of Queen\nAnne's day is as antiquated as their periwigs and knee-breeches. Except\nfor purposes of historical investigation it is quite absurd to take the\n'Essay on Criticism' seriously.\n\nAnd yet it has even for us of to-day a real value. Our age absolutely\nlacks a standard of literary criticism; and of all standards the one\nleast likely to be accepted is that of Pope and his fellow-believers.\nIndividual taste reigns supreme in this democratic age, and one man's\njudgment is as good as, perhaps a little better than, another's. But\neven this democratic and individual age may profit by turning back for a\ntime to consider some of the general truths, as valid to-day as ever, to\nwhich Pope gave such inimitable expression, or to study the outlines of\nthat noble picture of the true critic which St. Beuve declared every\nprofessed critic should frame and hang up in his study. An age which\nseems at times upon the point of throwing classical studies overboard as\nuseless lumber might do far worse than listen to the eloquent tribute\nwhich the poet pays to the great writers of antiquity. And finally\nnothing could be more salutary for an age in which literature itself has\ncaught something of the taint of the prevailing commercialism than to\nbathe itself again in that spirit of sincere and disinterested love of\nletters which breathes throughout the 'Essay' and which, in spite of all\nhis errors, and jealousies, and petty vices, was the master-passion of\nAlexander Pope.\n\n\n\n'6 censure:'\n\nthe word has here its original meaning of \"judge,\" not its modern \"judge\nseverely\" or \"blame.\"\n\n\n'8'\n\nBecause each foolish poem provokes a host of foolish commentators and\ncritics.\n\n\n'15-16'\n\nThis assertion that only a good writer can be a fair critic is not to be\naccepted without reservation.\n\n\n'17'\n\nThe word \"wit\" has a number of different meanings in this poem, and the\nstudent should be careful to discriminate between them. It means\n\n1) mind, intellect, l. 61;\n2) learning, culture, l 727;\n3) imagination, genius, l. 82;\n4) the power to discover amusing analogies, or the apt expression of\nsuch an analogy, ll. 449, 297;\n5) a man possessed of wit in its various significations, l. 45;\nthis last form usually occurs in the plural, ll. 104, 539.\n\n\n'26 the maze of schools:'\n\nthe labyrinth of conflicting systems of thought, especially of criticism.\n\n\n'21 coxcombs ... fools:'\n\nwhat is the difference in meaning between these words in this passage?\n\n\n'30-31'\n\nIn this couplet Pope hits off the spiteful envy of conceited critics\ntoward successful writers. If the critic can write himself, he hates the\nauthor as a rival; if he cannot, he entertains against him the deep\ngrudge an incapable man so often cherishes toward an effective worker.\n\n\n'34 M\u00c3\u00a6vius:'\n\na poetaster whose name has been handed down by Virgil and Horace. His\nname, like that of his associate, Bavius, has become a by-word for a\nwretched scribbler.\n\n'Apollo':\n\nhere thought of as the god of poetry. The true poet was inspired by\nApollo; but a poetaster like M\u00c3\u00a6vius wrote without inspiration, as it\nwere, in spite of the god.\n\n\n'40-43'\n\nPope here compares \"half-learned\" critics to the animals which old\nwriters reported were bred from the Nile mud. In 'Antony and Cleopatra',\nfor example, Lepidus says, \"Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your\nmud by the operation of your sun; so is your crocodile.\" Pope thinks of\nthese animals as in the unformed stage, part \"kindled into life, part a\nlump of mud.\" So these critics are unfinished things for which no proper\nname can be found. \"Equivocal generation\" is the old term used to denote\nspontaneous generation of this sort. Pope applies it here to critics\nwithout proper training who spring spontaneously from the mire of\nignorance.\n\n\n'44 tell:'\n\ncount.\n\n\n'45'\n\nThe idea is that a vain wit's tongue could out-talk a hundred ordinary\nmen's.\n\n\n'53 pretending wit:'\n\npresuming, or ambitious mind.\n\n\n'56-58 memory ... understanding imagination.'\n\nThis is the old threefold division of the human mind. Pope means that\nwhere one of these faculties is above the average in any individual,\nanother of them is sure to fall below. Is this always the case?\n\n\n'63 peculiar arts:'\n\nspecial branches of knowledge.\n\n\n'73'\n\nIn what sense can nature be called the source, the end, and the test of\nart?\n\n\n'76 th' informing soul:'\n\nthe soul which not only dwells in, but animates\nand molds the body.\n\n\n'80-81'\n\nWhat two meanings are attached to \"wit\" in this couplet?\n\n\n'84 'Tis more:'\n\nit is more important.\n\n'the Muse's steed:'\n\nPegasus, the winged horse of Greek mythology, was supposed to be the\nhorse of the Muses and came to be considered a symbol of poetic genius.\n\n\n'86 gen'rous:'\n\nhigh-bred.\n\n\n'88'\n\nWhat is the difference between \"discovered\" and \"devised\"?\n\n\n'94 Parnassus' top:'\n\nthe Muses were supposed to dwell on the top of Parnassus, a mountain in\nGreece. Great poets are here thought of as having climbed the mountain\nto dwell with the Muses.\n\n\n'96'\n\nWhat is (cf. text) \"the immortal prize\"?\n\n\n'99 She',\n\ni.e. learned Greece, especially Greek criticism, which obtained the\nrules of poetry from the practice of great poets, and, as it were,\nsystematized their inspiration.\n\n\n'104 following wits':\n\nlater scholars.\n\n\n'105'\n\nWhat is meant by \"the mistress\" and \"the maid\" in this line?\n\n\n'109 Doctor's bills:'\n\nprescriptions.\n\n\n'112'\n\nThese are the prosy commentators on great poets, whose dreary notes\noften disgust readers with the original.\n\n\n'120 fable:'\n\nplot.\n\n\n'123'\n\nWhat is the difference between \"cavil\" and \"criticise\"?\n\n\n'129 the Mantuan Muse:'\n\nthe poetry of Virgil, which Pope thinks the best commentary on Homer. In\nwhat sense is this to be understood?\n\n\n'130 Maro:'\n\nVirgil, whose full name was Publius Vergilius Maro, Pope here praises\nVirgil's well-known imitation of Homer. Since \"nature and Homer were the\nsame,\" a young poet like Virgil could do nothing better than copy Homer.\n\n\n'138 the Stagirite:'\n\nAristotle, a native of Stagyra, was the first and one of the greatest of\nliterary critics. His \"rules\" were drawn from the practice of great\npoets, and so, according to Pope, to imitate Homer was to obey the\n\"ancient rules.\"\n\n\n'141'\n\nThere are some beauties in poetry which cannot be explained by criticism.\n\n\n'142 happiness:'\n\nused here to express the peculiar charm of spontaneous poetic expression\nas contrasted with \"care,\" 'i.e.' the art of revising and improving,\nwhich can be taught.\n\n\n'152 vulgar bounds:'\n\nthe limitations imposed upon ordinary writers.\n\n\n'157 out of ... rise:'\n\nsurpass the ordinary scenes of nature.\n\n\n'159 Great wits:'\n\npoets of real genius.\n\n\n'160 faults:'\n\nhere used in the sense of irregularities, exceptions to the rules of\npoetry. When these are justified by the poet's genius, true critics do\nnot presume to correct them. In many editions this couplet comes after\nl. 151. This was Pope's first arrangement, but he later shifted it to\nits present position.\n\n\n'162 As Kings:'\n\nthe Stuart kings claimed the right to \"dispense with laws,\" that is, to\nset them aside in special instances. In 1686 eleven out of twelve\nEnglish judges decided in a test case that \"it is a privilege\ninseparably connected with the sovereignty of the king to dispense with\npenal laws, and that according to his own judgment.\" The English people\nvery naturally felt that such a privilege opened the door to absolute\nmonarchy, and after the fall of James II, Parliament declared in 1689\nthat \"the pretended power of suspending of laws ... without the consent\nof Parliament, is illegal.\"\n\n\n'164 its End:'\n\nthe purpose of every law of poetry, namely, to please the reader. This\npurpose must not be \"transgressed,\" 'i.e.' forgotten by those who wish\nto make exceptions to these laws.\n\n\n'166 their precedent:'\n\nthe example of classic poets.\n\n\n'179 stratagems ... error:'\n\nthings in the classic poets which to carping critics seem faults are\noften clever devices to make a deeper impression on the reader.\n\n\n'180 Homer nods:'\n\nHorace in his 'Art of Poetry' used this figure to imply that even the\ngreatest poet sometimes made mistakes. Pope very neatly suggests that it\nmay be the critic rather than the poet who is asleep.\n\n\n'181 each ancient Altar:'\n\nused here to denote the works of the great classic writers. The whole\npassage down to l. 200 is a noble outburst of enthusiasm for the poets\nwhom Pope had read so eagerly in early youth.\n\n\n'186 consenting P\u00c3\u00a6ans:'\n\nunanimous hymns of praise.\n\n\n'194 must ... found:'\n\nare not destined to be discovered till some future time.\n\n\n'196'\n\nWho is \"the last, the meanest of your sons\"?\n\n\n'203 bias:'\n\nmental bent, or inclination.\n\n\n'208'\n\nThis line is based upon physiological theories which are now obsolete.\nAccording to these wind or air supplied the lack of blood or of animal\nspirits in imperfectly constituted bodies. To such bodies Pope compares\nthose ill-regulated minds where a deficiency of learning and natural\nability is supplied by self-conceit.\n\n\n'216' The Pierian spring:\n\nthe spring of the Muses, who were called Pierides in Greek mythology. It\nis used here as a symbol for learning, particularly for the study of\nliterature.\n\n\n'222' the lengths behind:\n\nthe great spaces of learning that lie behind the first objects of our\nstudy.\n\n\n'225-232'\n\nThis fine simile is one of the best expressions in English verse of the\nmodesty of the true scholar, due to his realization of the boundless\nextent of knowledge. It was such a feeling that led Sir Isaac Newton to\nsay after all his wonderful discoveries,\n\n  \"I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to\n  have been only like a boy playing on the seashore and diverting myself\n  in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than\n  ordinary whilst the great ocean of truth lay all the time undiscovered\n  before me.\"\n\n\n'244' peculiar parts:\n\nindividual parts.\n\n\n'248 ev'n thine, O Rome:'\n\nthere are so many splendid churches in Rome that an inhabitant of this\ncity would be less inclined than a stranger to wonder at the perfect\nproportions of any of them. But there are two, at least, the Pantheon\nand St. Peter's, which might justly evoke the admiration even of a\nRoman. It was probably of one of these that Pope was thinking.\n\n\n'265'\n\nWhat is the difference between \"principles\" and \"notions\" in this line?\n\n\n'265 La Mancha's Knight:'\n\nDon Quixote. The anecdote that follows is not taken from Cervantes'\nnovel, but from a continuation of it by an author calling himself\nAvellanada. The story is that Don Quixote once fell in with a scholar\nwho had written a play about a persecuted queen of Bohemia. Her\ninnocence in the original story was established by a combat in the\nlists, but this the poet proposed to omit as contrary to the rules of\nAristotle. The Don, although professing great respect for Aristotle,\ninsisted that the combat was the best part of the story and must be\nacted, even if a special theater had to be built for the purpose, or the\nplay given in the open fields. Pope quotes this anecdote to show how\nsome critics in spite of their professed acceptance of general rules are\nso prejudiced in favor of a minor point as to judge a whole work of art\nfrom one standpoint only.\n\n\n'270 Dennis:'\n\nJohn Dennis, a playwright and critic of Pope's time. Pope and he were\nengaged in frequent quarrels, but this first reference to him in Pope's\nworks is distinctly complimentary. The line probably refers to some\nremarks by Dennis on the Grecian stage in his 'Impartial Critic', a\npamphlet published in 1693.\n\n\n'273 nice:'\n\ndiscriminating; in l. 286 the meaning is \"over-scrupulous, finicky.\"\n\n\n'276 unities:'\n\naccording to the laws of dramatic composition generally accepted in\nPope's day, a play must observe the unities of subject, place, and time.\nThat is, it must have one main theme, not a number of diverse stories,\nfor its plot; all the scenes must be laid in one place, or as nearly so\nas possible; and the action must be begun and finished within the space\nof twenty-four hours.\n\n\n'286 Curious:'\n\nfastidious, over-particular.\n\n\n'288 by a love to parts:'\n\nby too diligent attention to particular parts of a work of art, which\nhinders them from forming a true judgment of the work as a whole.\n\n\n'289 Conceit:'\n\nan uncommon or fantastic expression of thought. \"Conceits\" had been much\nsought after by the poets who wrote in the first half of the seventeenth\ncentury.\n\n'297 True Wit:'\n\nhere opposed to the \"conceit\" of which Pope has been speaking. It is\ndefined as a natural idea expressed in fit words.\n\n\n'299 whose truth ... find:'\n\nof whose truth we find ourselves at once convinced.\n\n\n'308 take upon content:'\n\ntake for granted.\n\n\n'311-317'\n\nShow how Pope uses the simile of the \"prismatic glass\" to distinguish\nbetween \"false eloquence\" and \"true expression.\"\n\n\n'319 decent:'\n\nbecoming.\n\n\n'328 Fungoso:'\n\na character in Ben Jonson's 'Every Man out of his Humour'. He is the son\nof a miserly farmer, and tries hard, though all in vain, to imitate the\ndress and manners of a fine gentleman.\n\n'329 These sparks:'\n\nthese would-be dandies.\n\n\n'337 Numbers:'\n\nrhythm, meter.\n\n\n'341 haunt Parnassus:\n\nread poetry.--ear:' note that in Pope's day this word rhymed with\n\"repair\" and \"there.\"\n\n\n'344 These:'\n\ncritics who care for the meter only in poetry insist on the proper\nnumber of syllables in a line, no matter what sort of sound or sense\nresults. For instance, they do not object to a series of \"open vowels,\"\n'i.e.' hiatuses caused by the juxtaposition of such words as \"tho\" and\n\"oft,\" \"the\" and \"ear.\" Line 345 is composed especially to show how\nfeeble a rhythm results from such a succession of \"open vowels.\" They do\nnot object to bolstering up a line with \"expletives,\" such as \"do\" in l.\n346, nor to using ten \"low words,\" 'i.e.' short, monosyllabic words to\nmake up a line.\n\n\n'347'\n\nWith this line Pope passes unconsciously from speaking of bad critics to\ndenouncing some of the errors of bad poets, who keep on using hackneyed\nphrases and worn-out metrical devices.\n\n\n'356 Alexandrine:'\n\na line of six iambic feet, such as l. 357, written especially to\nillustrate this form. Why does Pope use the adjective \"needless\" here?\n\n\n'361 Denham's strength ... Waller's sweetness:'\n\nWaller and Denham were poets of the century before Pope; they are almost\nforgotten to-day, but were extravagantly admired in his time. Waller\nbegan and Denham continued the fashion of writing in \"closed\" heroic\ncouplets, 'i.e.' in verses where the sense is for the most part\ncontained within one couplet and does not run over into the next as had\nbeen the fashion in earlier verse. Dryden said that \"the excellence and\ndignity of rhyme were never fully known till Mr. Waller taught it,\" and\nthe same critic spoke of Denham's poetry as \"majestic and correct.\"\n\n\n'370 Ajax:'\n\none of the heroes of the 'Iliad'. He is represented more than once as\nhurling huge stones at his enemies. Note that Pope has endeavored in\nthis and the following line to convey the sense of effort and struggle.\nWhat means does he employ? Do you think he succeeds?\n\n\n'372 Camilla:'\n\na heroine who appears in the latter part of the '\u00c3\u0086neid' fighting against\nthe Trojan invaders of Italy. Virgil says that she was so swift of foot\nthat she might have run over a field of wheat without breaking the\nstalks, or across the sea without wetting her feet. Pope attempts in l.\n373 to reproduce in the sound and movement of his verse the sense of\nswift flight.\n\n\n'374 Timotheus:'\n\na Greek poet and singer who was said to have played and sung before\nAlexander the Great. The reference in this passage is to Dryden's famous\npoem, 'Alexander's Feast'.\n\n\n'376 the son of Libyan Jove:'\n\nAlexander the Great, who boasted that he was the son of Jupiter. The\nfamous oracle of Jupiter Ammon situated in the Libyan desert was visited\nby Alexander, who was said to have learned there the secret of his\nparentage.\n\n\n'383 Dryden:'\n\nthis fine compliment is paid to a poet whom Pope was proud to\nacknowledge as his master. \"I learned versification wholly from Dryden's\nworks,\" he once said. Pope's admiration for Dryden dated from early\nyouth, and while still a boy he induced a friend to take him to see the\nold poet in his favorite coffee-house.\n\n\n'391' admire:\n\nnot used in our modern sense, but in its original meaning, \"to wonder\nat.\" According to Pope, it is only fools who are lost in wonder at the\nbeauties of a poem; wise men \"approve,\" 'i.e.' test and pronounce them\ngood.\n\n\n'396-397'\n\nPope acknowledged that in these lines he was alluding to the\nuncharitable belief of his fellow-Catholics that all outside the fold of\nthe Catholic church were sure to be damned.\n\n\n'400 sublimes:'\n\npurifies.\n\n\n'404 each:'\n\neach age.\n\n\n'415 joins with Quality:'\n\ntakes sides with \"the quality,\" 'i.e.' people of rank.\n\n\n'429'\n\nAre so clever that they refuse to accept the common and true belief, and\nso forfeit their salvation.\n\n\n'441 Sentences:'\n\nthe reference is to a mediaeval treatise on Theology, by Peter Lombard,\ncalled the 'Book of Sentences'. It was long used as a university\ntext-book.\n\n\n'444 Scotists and Thomists:'\n\nmediaeval scholars, followers respectively of Duns Scotus and Thomas\nAquinas. A long dispute raged between their disciples. In this couplet\nPope points out that the dispute is now forgotten, and the books of the\nold disputants lie covered with cobwebs in Duck-lane, a street in London\nwhere second-hand books were sold in Pope's day. He calls the cobwebs\n\"kindred,\" because the arguments of Thomists and Scotists were as fine\nspun as a spider's web.\n\n\n'449'\n\n\"The latest fashionable folly is the test, or the proof, of a quick,\nup-to-date wit.\" In other words, to be generally accepted an author must\naccept the current fashion, foolish though it may be.\n\n\n'457'\n\nThis was especially true in Pope's day when literature was so closely\nconnected with politics that an author's work was praised or blamed not\nupon its merits, but according to his, and the critic's, politics.\n\n\n'459 Parsons, Critics, Beaus':\n\nDryden, the head of English letters in the generation before Pope, had\nbeen bitterly assailed on various charges by parsons, like Jeremy\nCollier, critics like Milbourn, and fine gentlemen like the Duke of\nBuckingham. But his works remained when the jests that were made against\nthem were forgotten.\n\n\n'463'\n\nSir Richard Blackmore, a famous doctor in Dryden's day, was also a very\ndull and voluminous writer. He attacked Dryden in a poem called 'A\nSatire against Wit'. Luke Milbourn was a clergyman of the same period,\nwho abused Dryden's translation of Virgil.\n\n\n'465 Zoilus':\n\na Greek critic who attacked Homer.\n\n\n'481'\n\nThe English language and the public taste had changed very rapidly\nduring the century preceding Pope. He imagined that these changes would\ncontinue so that no poet's reputation would last longer than a man's\nlife, \"bare threescore,\" and Dryden's poetry would come to be as hard to\nunderstand and as little read as Chaucer's at that time. It is worth\nnoting that both Dryden and Pope rewrote parts of Chaucer in modern\nEnglish.\n\n\n'506-507'\n\nExplain why \"wit\" is feared by wicked men and shunned by the virtuous,\nhated by fools, and \"undone\" or ruined by knaves.\n\n\n'521 sacred':\n\naccursed, like the Latin 'sacer'.\n\n\n'527 spleen':\n\nbad temper.\n\n\n'534 the fat age':\n\nthe reign of Charles II, as ll. 536-537 show, when literature became\nnotoriously licentious.\n\n\n'538 Jilts ... statesmen':\n\nloose women like Lady Castlemaine and the Duchess of Portsmouth had\ngreat influence on the politics of Charles II's time, and statesmen of\nthat day like Buckingham and Etheredge wrote comedies.\n\n\n'541 Mask':\n\nit was not uncommon in Restoration times for ladies to wear a mask in\npublic, especially at the theater. Here the word is used to denote the\nwoman who wore a mask.\n\n\n'544 a Foreign reign':\n\nthe reign of William III, a Dutchman.

Many ancient writings were erased,\nfor example, in order to get parchment for monkish chronicles and\ncommentaries.\n\n\n'693 Erasmus:'\n\nperhaps the greatest scholar of the Renaissance. Pope calls him the\n\"glory of the priesthood\" on account of his being a monk of such\nextraordinary learning, and \"the shame\" of his order, because he was so\nabused by monks in his lifetime. Is this a good antithesis?\n\n\n'697 Leo's golden days:'\n\nthe pontificate of Leo X (1513-1521). Leo himself was a generous patron\nof art and learning.

Pope was sincerely\nattached to him, and this tribute to his dead friend is marked by deep\nand genuine feeling.\n\n\n'738 short excursions:'\n\nsuch as this 'Essay on Criticism' instead of longer and more ambitious\npoems which Pope planned and in part executed in his boyhood.

It corresponds closely to his\nearly work, the 'Essay on Criticism'. Like the earlier work, the 'Essay\non Man' is a didactic poem, written primarily to diffuse and popularize\ncertain ideas of the poet. As in the earlier work these ideas are by no\nmeans original with Pope, but were the common property of a school of\nthinkers in his day. As in the 'Essay on Criticism', Pope here attempts\nto show that these ideas have their origin in nature and are consistent\nwith the common sense of man. And finally the merit of the later work,\neven more than of the earlier, is due to the force and brilliancy of\ndetached passages rather than to any coherent, consistent, and\nwell-balanced system which it presents.\n\nThe close of the seventeenth century and beginning of the eighteenth was\nmarked by a change of ground in the sphere of religious controversy. The\nold debates between the Catholic and Protestant churches gradually died\nout as these two branches of Western Christianity settled down in quiet\npossession of the territory they still occupy. In their place arose a\nvigorous controversy on the first principles of religion in general, on\nthe nature of God, the origin of evil, the place of man in the universe,\nand the respective merits of optimism and pessimism as philosophic\ntheories. The controversialists as a rule either rejected or neglected\nthe dogmas of revealed religion and based their arguments upon real or\nsupposed facts of history, physical nature, and the mental processes and\nmoral characteristics of man. In this controversy the two parties at\ntimes were curiously mingled. Orthodox clergymen used arguments which\njustified a strong suspicion of their orthodoxy; and avowed freethinkers\nbitterly disclaimed the imputation of atheism and wrote in terms that\nmight be easily adopted by a devout believer.\n\nInto this controversy Pope was led by his deepening intimacy with\nBolingbroke, who had returned from France in 1725 and settled at his\ncountry place within a few miles of Twickenham. During his long exile\nBolingbroke had amused himself with the study of moral philosophy and\nnatural religion, and in his frequent intercourse with Pope he poured\nout his new-found opinions with all the fluency, vigor, and polish which\nmade him so famous among the orators and talkers of the day.\nBolingbroke's views were for that time distinctly heterodox, and, if\nlogically developed, led to complete agnosticism. But he seems to have\navoided a complete statement of his ideas to Pope, possibly for fear of\nshocking or frightening the sensitive little poet who still remained a\nprofessed Catholic. Pope, however, was very far from being a strict\nCatholic, and indeed prided himself on the breadth and liberality of his\nopinions. He was, therefore, at once fascinated and stimulated by the\neloquent conversation of Bolingbroke, and resolved to write a\nphilosophical poem in which to embody the ideas they held in common.\nBolingbroke approved of the idea, and went so far as to furnish the poet\nwith seven or eight sheets of notes \"to direct the plan in general and\nto supply matter for particular epistles.\" Lord Bathurst, who knew both\nPope and Bolingbroke, went so far as to say in later years that the\n'Essay' was originally composed by Bolingbroke in prose and that Pope\nonly put it into verse. But this is undoubtedly an exaggeration of what\nPope himself frankly acknowledged, that the poem was composed under the\ninfluence of Bolingbroke, that in the main it reflected his opinions,\nand that Bolingbroke had assisted him in the general plan and in\nnumerous details. Very properly, therefore, the poem is addressed to\nBolingbroke and begins and closes with a direct address to the poet's\n\"guide, philosopher, and friend.\"\n\nIn substance the 'Essay on Man' is a discussion of the moral order of\nthe world. Its purpose is \"to vindicate the ways of God to man,\" and it\nmay therefore be regarded as an attempt to confute the skeptics who\nargued from the existence of evil in the world and the wretchedness of\nman's existence to the impossibility of belief in an all-good and\nall-wise God. It attempts to do this, not by an appeal to revelation or\nthe doctrines of Christianity, but simply on the basis of a common-sense\ninterpretation of the facts of existence.\n\nA brief outline of the poem will show the general tenor of Pope's\nargument.\n\nThe first epistle deals with the nature and state of man with respect to\nthe universe. It insists on the limitations of man's knowledge, and the\nconsequent absurdity of his presuming to murmur against God. It teaches\nthat the universe was not made for man, but that man with all his\napparent imperfections is exactly fitted to the place which he occupies\nin the universe. In the physical universe all things work together for\ngood, although certain aspects of nature seem evil to man, and likewise\nin the moral universe all things, even man's passions and crimes conduce\nto the general good of the whole. Finally it urges calm submission and\nacquiescence in what is hard to understand, since \"one truth is\nclear,--whatever is, is right.\"\n\nThe second epistle deals with the nature of man as an individual. It\nbegins by urging men to abandon vain questionings of God's providence\nand to take up the consideration of their own natures, for \"the proper\nstudy of mankind is man.\" Pope points out that the two cardinal\nprinciples of man's nature are self-love and reason, the first an\nimpelling, the second a regulating power. The aim of both these\nprinciples is pleasure, by which Pope means happiness, which he takes\nfor the highest good. Each man is dominated by a master passion, and it\nis the proper function of reason to control this passion for good and to\nmake it bear fruit in virtue. No man is wholly virtuous or vicious, and\nHeaven uses the mingled qualities of men to bind them together in mutual\ninterdependence, and makes the various passions and imperfections of\nmankind serve the general good. And the final conclusion is that \"though\nman's a fool, yet God is wise.\"\n\nThe third epistle treats of the nature of man with respect to society.\nAll creatures, Pope asserts, are bound together and live not for\nthemselves alone, but man is preeminently a social being. The first\nstate of man was the state of nature when he lived in innocent ignorance\nwith his fellow-creatures. Obeying the voice of nature, man learned to\ncopy and improve upon the instincts of the animals, to build, to plow,\nto spin, to unite in societies like those of ants and bees. The first\nform of government was patriarchal; then monarchies arose in which\nvirtue, \"in arms or arts,\" made one man ruler over many. In either case\nthe origin of true government as of true religion was love. Gradually\nforce crept in and uniting with superstition gave rise to tyranny and\nfalse religions. Poets and patriots, however, restored the ancient faith\nand taught power's due use by showing the necessity of harmony in the\nstate. Pope concludes by asserting the folly of contention for forms of\ngovernment or modes of faith. The common end of government as of\nreligion is the general good. It may be noticed in passing that Pope's\naccount of the evolution of society bears even less relation to\nhistorical facts than does his account of the development of literature\nin the 'Essay on Criticism.'\n\nThe last epistle discusses the nature of happiness, \"our being's end and\naim.\" Happiness is attainable by all men who think right and mean well.\nIt consists not in individual, but in mutual pleasure. It does not\nconsist in external things, mere gifts of fortune, but in health, peace,\nand competence. Virtuous men are, indeed, subject to calamities of\nnature; but God cannot be expected to suspend the operation of general\nlaws to spare the virtuous. Objectors who would construct a system in\nwhich all virtuous men are blest, are challenged to define the virtuous\nand to specify what is meant by blessings. Honors, nobility, fame,\nsuperior talents, often merely serve to make their possessors unhappy.\nVirtue alone is happiness, and virtue consists in a recognition of the\nlaws of Providence, and in love for one's fellow-man.\n\nEven this brief outline will show, I think, some of the inconsistencies\nand omissions of Pope's train of thought. A careful examination of his\narguments in detail would be wholly out of place here. The reader who\nwishes to pursue the subject further may consult Warburton's elaborate\nvindication of Pope's argument, and Elwin's equally prosy refutation, or\nbetter still the admirable summary by Leslie Stephen in the chapter on\nthis poem in his life of Pope ('English Men of Letters'). No one is now\nlikely to turn to the writer of the early eighteenth century for a\nsystem of the universe, least of all to a writer so incapable of exact\nor systematic thinking as Alexander Pope. If the 'Essay on Man' has any\nclaim to be read to-day, it must be as a piece of literature pure and\nsimple. For philosophy and poetry combined, Browning and Tennyson lie\nnearer to our age and mode of thought than Pope.\n\nEven regarded as a piece of literature the 'Essay on Man' cannot, I\nthink, claim the highest place among Pope's works. It obtained, indeed,\na success at home and abroad such as was achieved by no other English\npoem until the appearance of 'Childe Harold'. It was translated into\nFrench, German, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, and Latin. It was imitated\nby Wieland, praised by Voltaire, and quoted by Kant. But this success\nwas due in part to the accuracy with which it reflected ideas which were\nthe common property of its age, in part to the extraordinary vigor and\nfinish of its epigrams, which made it one of the most quotable of\nEnglish poems. But as a whole the Essay is not a great poem. The poet is\nevidently struggling with a subject that is too weighty for him, and at\ntimes he staggers and sinks beneath his burden. The second and third\nbooks in particular are, it must be confessed, with the exception of one\nor two fine outbursts, little better than dull, and dullness is not a\nquality one is accustomed to associate with Pope. The 'Essay on Man'\nlacks the bright humor and imaginative artistry of 'The Rape of the\nLock,' and the lively portraiture, vigorous satire, and strong personal\nnote of the 'Moral Epistles' and 'Imitations of Horace'. Pope is at his\nbest when he is dealing with a concrete world of men and women as they\nlived and moved in the London of his day; he is at his worst when he is\nattempting to seize and render abstract ideas.\n\nYet the 'Essay on Man' is a very remarkable work. In the first place, it\nshows Pope's wonderful power of expression. No one can read the poem for\nthe first time without meeting on page after page phrases and epigrams\nwhich have become part of the common currency of our language. Pope's\n\"precision and firmness of touch,\" to quote the apt statement of Leslie\nStephen, \"enables him to get the greatest possible meaning into a narrow\ncompass. He uses only one epithet, but it is the right one.\" Even when\nthe thought is commonplace enough, the felicity of the expression gives\nit a new and effective force. And there are whole passages where Pope\nrises high above the mere coining of epigrams. As I have tried to show\nin my notes he composed by separate paragraphs, and when he chances upon\na topic that appeals to his imagination or touches his heart, we get an\noutburst of poetry that shines in splendid contrast to the prosaic\nplainness of its surroundings. Such, for example, are the noble verses\nthat tell of the immanence of God in his creation at the close of the\nfirst epistle, or the magnificent invective against tyranny and\nsuperstition in the third (ll. 241-268).\n\nFinally the 'Essay on Man' is of interest in what it tells us of Pope\nhimself. Mr. Elwin's idea that in the 'Essay on Man' Pope, \"partly the\ndupe, partly the accomplice of Bolingbroke,\" was attempting craftily to\nundermine the foundations of religion, is a notion curiously compounded\nof critical blindness and theological rancor. In spite of all its\nincoherencies and futilities the 'Essay' is an honest attempt to express\nPope's opinions, borrowed in part, of course, from his admired friend,\nbut in part the current notions of his age, on some of the greatest\nquestions that have perplexed the mind of man. And Pope's attitude\ntoward the questions is that of the best minds of his day, at once\nreligious, independent, and sincere. He acknowledges the omnipotence and\nbenevolence of God, confesses the limitations and imperfections of human\nknowledge, teaches humility in the presence of unanswerable problems,\nurges submission to Divine Providence, extols virtue as the true source\nof happiness, and love of man as an essential of virtue. If we study the\n'Essay on Man' as the reasoned argument of a philosopher, we shall turn\nfrom it with something like contempt; if we read it as the expression of\na poet's sentiments, we shall, I think, leave it with an admiration\nwarmer than before for a character that has been so much abused and so\nlittle understood as that of Pope.\n\n\n\nTHE DESIGN\n\n'2 Bacon's expression:'\n\nin the dedication of his 'Essays' (1625) to Buckingham, Bacon speaks of\nthem as the most popular of his writings, \"for that, as it seems, they\ncome home to men's business and bosoms.\"\n\n\n'11 anatomy:' dissection.\n\n\nEPISTLE I\n\n'1 St. John:'\n\nHenry St. John, Lord Bolingbroke, Pope's \"guide, philosopher, and\nfriend,\" under whose influence the 'Essay on Man' was composed.\n\n\n'5 expatiate:'\n\nrange, wander.\n\n\n'6'\n\nPope says that this line alludes to the subject of this first Epistle,\n\"the state of man here and hereafter, disposed by Providence, though to\nhim unknown.\" The next two lines allude to the main topics of the three\nremaining epistles, \"the constitution of the human mind ... the\ntemptations of misapplied self-love, and the wrong pursuits of power,\npleasure, and false happiness.\"\n\n\n'9 beat ... field:'\n\nthe metaphor is drawn from hunting. Note how it is elaborated in the\nfollowing lines.\n\n\n'12 blindly creep ... sightless soar:'\n\nthe first are the ignorant and indifferent; those who \"sightless soar\"\nare the presumptuous who reason blindly about things too high for human\nknowledge.\n\n\n'15 candid:'\n\nlenient, free from harsh judgments.\n\n\n'16'\n\nAn adaptation of a well-known line of Milton's 'Paradise Lost', l, 26.\n\n\n'17-23'\n\nPope lays down as the basis of his system that all argument about man or\nGod must be based upon what we know of man's present life, and of God's\nworkings in this world of ours.\n\n\n'29 this frame:'\n\nthe universe. Compare 'Hamlet', II, ii, 310, \"this goodly frame, the\nearth.\"\n\n\n'30 nice dependencies:'\n\nsubtle inter-relations.\n\n\n'31 Gradations just:'\n\nexact shades of difference.\n\n\n'32 a part:'\n\nthe mind of man, which is but a part of the whole universe.\n\n\n'33 the great chain:'\n\naccording to Homer, Jove, the supreme God, sustained the whole creation\nby a golden chain. Milton also makes use of this idea of the visible\nuniverse as linked to heaven in a golden chain, 'Paradise Lost', II,\n1004-1006, and 1051-1052.\n\n\n'41 yonder argent fields:'\n\nthe sky spangled with silvery stars. The phrase is borrowed from Milton,\n'Paradise Lost', III, 460.\n\n\n'42 Jove:'\n\nthe planet Jupiter.\n\n'satellites:'\n\nPope preserves here the Latin pronunciation, four syllables, with the\naccent on the antepenult.\n\n\n'43-50.'\n\nPope here takes it for granted that our universe, inasmuch as it is the\nwork of God's infinite wisdom, must be the best system possible. If this\nbe granted, he says, it is plain that man must have a place somewhere in\nthis system, and the only question is whether \"God has placed him wrong.\"\n\n\n'45'\n\nEvery grade in creation must be complete, so as to join with that which\nis beneath and with that which is above it or there would be a lack of\ncoherency, a break, somewhere in the system.\n\n\n'47 reas'ning life:'\n\nconscious mental life.\n\n\n'51-60'\n\nPope argues here that since man is a part of the best possible system,\nwhatever seems wrong in him must be right when considered in relation to\nthe whole order of the universe. It is only our ignorance of this order\nwhich keeps us from realizing this fact.\n\n\n'55 one single:'\n\nthe word \"movement\" is understood after \"single.\"\n\n\n'61-68'\n\nPope here illustrates his preceding argument by analogy. We can know no\nmore of God's purpose in the ordering of our lives than the animals can\nknow of our ordering of theirs.\n\n\n'64 \u00c3\u0086gypt's God:'\n\nOne of the gods of the Egyptians was the sacred bull, Apis.\n\n\n'68 a deity:'\n\nworshiped as a god, like the Egyptian kings and Roman emperors.\n\n\n'69-76'\n\nPope now goes on to argue that on the basis of what has been proved we\nought not to regard man as an imperfect being, but rather as one who is\nperfectly adapted to his place in the universe. His knowledge, for\nexample, is measured by the brief time he has to live and the brief\nspace he can survey.\n\n\n'69 fault:'\n\npronounced in Pope's day as rhyming with \"ought.\"\n\n\n'73-76'\n\nThese lines are really out of place. They first appeared after l. 98;\nthen Pope struck them out altogether. Just before his death he put them\ninto their present place on the advice of Warburton, who probably\napproved of them because of their reference to a future state of bliss.\nIt is plain that they interfere with the regular argument of the poem.\n\n\n'79'\n\nThis line is grammatically dependent upon \"hides,\" l. 77.\n\n\n'81 riot:'\n\nused here in the sense of \"luxurious life.\" The lamb is slain to provide\nfor some feast.\n\n\n'86 Heav'n:'\n\n'i.e.' God. Hence the relative \"who\" in the next line.\n\n\n'92-98'\n\nPope urges man to comfort himself with hope, seeing that he cannot know\nthe future.\n\n\n'93 \"What future bliss:\"\n\nthe words \"shall be\" are to be understood after this phrase.\n\n\n'96'\n\nPoint out the exact meaning of this familiar line.\n\n\n'97 from home:'\n\naway from its true home, the life to come. This line represents one of\nthe alterations which Warburton induced Pope to make. The poet first\nwrote \"confined at home,\" thus representing this life as the home of the\nsoul. His friend led him to make the change in order to express more\nclearly his belief in the soul's immortality.\n\n\n'89'\n\nShow how \"rests\" and \"expatiates\" in this line contrast with \"uneasy\"\nand \"confined\" in l. 97.\n\n\n'99-112'\n\nIn this famous passage Pope shows how the belief in immortality is found\neven among the most ignorant tribes. This is to Pope an argument that\nthe soul must be immortal, since only Nature, or God working through\nNature, could have implanted this conception in the Indian's mind.\n\n\n'102 the solar walk:'\n\nthe sun's path in the heavens.\n\n'the milky way:'\n\nsome old philosophers held that the souls of good men went thither after\ndeath.\n\n\nPope means that the ignorant Indian had no conception of a heaven\nreserved for the just such as Greek sages and Christian believers have.\nAll he believes in is \"an humbler heaven,\" where he shall be free from\nthe evils of this life. Line 108 has special reference to the tortures\ninflicted upon the natives of Mexico and Peru by the avaricious Spanish\nconquerors.\n\n\n'109-110'\n\nHe is contented with a future existence, without asking for the glories\nof the Christian's heaven.\n\n\n'111 equal sky:'\n\nimpartial heaven, for the heaven of the Indians was open to all men,\ngood or bad.\n\n\n'113-130'\n\nIn this passage Pope blames those civilized men who, though they should\nbe wiser than the Indian, murmur against the decrees of God. The\nimperative verbs \"weigh,\" \"call,\" \"say,\" etc., are used satirically.\n\n\n'113 scale of sense:'\n\nthe scale, or means of judgment, which our senses give us.\n\n\n'117 gust:'\n\nthe pleasure of taste.\n\n\n'120'\n\nThe murmurers are dissatisfied that man is not at once perfect in his\npresent state and destined to immortality, although such gifts have been\ngiven to no other creature.\n\n\n'123 reas'ning Pride:'\n\nthe pride of the intellect which assumes to condemn God's providence.\n\n\n'131-172'\n\nIn this passage Pope imagines a dialogue between one of the proud\nmurmurers he has described and himself. His opponent insists that the\nworld was made primarily for man's enjoyment (ll. 132-140). Pope asks\nwhether nature does not seem to swerve from this end of promoting human\nhappiness in times of pestilence, earthquake, and tempest (ll. 141-144).\nThe other answers that these are only rare exceptions to the general\nlaws, due perhaps to some change in nature since the world began (ll.\n145-148). Pope replies by asking why there should not be exceptions in\nthe moral as well as in the physical world; may not great villains be\ncompared to terrible catastrophes in nature (ll. 148-156)? He goes on to\nsay that no one but God can answer this question, that our human\nreasoning springs from pride, and that the true course of reasoning is\nsimply to submit (ll. 156-164). He then suggests that \"passions,\" by\nwhich he means vices, are as necessary a part of the moral order as\nstorms of the physical world (ll. 165-172).\n\n\n'142 livid deaths':\n\npestilence.\n\n\n'143-144'\n\nPope was perhaps thinking of a terrible earthquake and flood that had\ncaused great loss of life in Chili the year before this poem appeared.\n\n\n'150 Then Nature deviates':\n\nNature departs from her regular order on such occasions as these\ncatastrophes.\n\n\n'151' that end:\n\nhuman happiness, as in l. 149.\n\n\n'156'\n\nC\u00c3\u00a6sar Borgia, the wicked son of Pope Alexander VI, and Catiline are\nmentioned here as portents in the moral world parallel to plagues and\nearthquakes in the physical.\n\n\n'160 young Ammon':\n\nAlexander the Great.

He points out that all animals, man included, have powers\nsuited to their position in the world (ll. 179-188), and asserts that if\nman had keener senses than he now has, he would be exposed to evils from\nwhich he now is free (ll. 193-203).\n\n\n'176 To want':\n\nto lack.\n\n'177'\n\nParaphrase this line in prose.\n\n\n'181 compensated':\n\naccented on the antepenult.\n\n\n'183 the state':\n\nthe place which the creature occupies in the natural world.\n\n\n'195 finer optics':\n\nkeener power of sight.\n\n\n'197 touch':\n\na noun, subject of \"were given,\" understood from l. 195.\n\n\n'199 quick effluvia':\n\npungent odors. The construction is very condensed here; \"effluvia\" may\nbe regarded like \"touch\" as a subject of \"were given\" (l. 195); but one\nwould expect rather a phrase to denote a keener sense of smell than man\nnow possesses.\n\n\n'202 music of the spheres':\n\nit was an old belief that the stars and planets uttered musical notes as\nthey moved along their courses. These notes made up the \"harmony of the\nspheres.\" Shakespeare ('Merchant of Venice', V, 64-5) says that our\nsenses are too dull to hear it. Pope, following a passage in Cicero's\n'Somnium Scipionis', suggests that this music is too loud for human\nsenses.\n\n\n'207-232'\n\nPope now goes on to show how in the animal world there is an exact\ngradation of the faculties of sense and of the powers of instinct. Man\nalone is endowed with reason which is more than equivalent to all these\npowers and makes him lord over all animals.\n\n\n'212'\n\nThe mole is almost blind; the lynx was supposed to be the most\nkeen-sighted of animals.\n\n\n'213-214'\n\nThe lion was supposed by Pope to hunt by sight alone as the dog by\nscent. What does he mean by \"the tainted green\"?\n\n\n'215-216'\n\nFishes are almost deaf, while birds are very quick of hearing.\n\n\n'219 nice:'\n\nkeenly discriminating.\n\n'healing dew:'\n\nhealthful honey.\n\n\n'221-222'\n\nThe power of instinct which is barely perceptible in the pig amounts\nalmost to the power of reason in the elephant.\n\n\n'223 barrier:'\n\npronounced like the French 'barri\u00c3\u00a8re', as a word of two syllables with\nthe accent on the last.\n\n\n'226 Sense ...

The exact sense is not very clear.\n\n\n'233-258'\n\nIn this passage Pope insists that the chain of being stretches unbroken\nfrom God through man to the lowest created forms. If any link in this\nchain were broken, as would happen if men possessed higher faculties\nthan are now assigned them, the whole universe would be thrown into\nconfusion. This is another answer to those who complain of the\nimperfections of man's nature.\n\n\n'234 quick:'\n\nliving. Pope does not discriminate between organic and inorganic matter.\n\n\n'240 glass:'\n\nmicroscope.\n\n\n'242-244'\n\nInferior beings might then press upon us. If they did not, a fatal gap\nwould be left by our ascent in the scale.\n\n\n'247 each system:'\n\nPope imagines the universe to be composed of an infinite number of\nsystems like ours. Since each of these is essential to the orderly\narrangement of the universe, any disorder such as he has imagined would\nhave infinitely destructive consequences. These are described in ll.\n251-257.\n\n\n'267-280'\n\nIn these lines Pope speaks of God as the soul of the world in an\noutburst of really exalted enthusiasm that is rare enough in his work.\n\n\n'269 That:'\n\na relative pronoun referring to \"soul,\" l. 268.\n\n\n'270 th' ethereal frame:' the heavens.\n\n\n'276 as perfect in a hair as heart:'\n\nthis has been called \"a vile antithesis,\" on the ground that there is no\nreason why hair and heart should be contrasted. But Pope may have had in\nmind the saying of Christ. \"the very hairs of your head are all\nnumbered.\" The hairs are spoken of here as the least important part of\nthe body; the heart, on the other hand, has always been thought of as\nthe most important organ. There is, therefore, a real antithesis between\nthe two.\n\n\n'278 Seraph ... burns:'\n\nthe seraphim according to old commentators are on fire with the love of\nGod.\n\n\n'280 equals all:'\n\nmakes all things equal. This does not seem consistent with the idea of\nthe gradations of existence which Pope has been preaching throughout\nthis Epistle. Possibly it means that all things high and low are filled\nalike with the divine spirit and in this sense all things are equal. But\none must not expect to find exact and consistent philosophy in the\n'Essay on Man'.\n\n\n'281-294'\n\nHere Pope sums up the argument of this Epistle, urging man to recognize\nhis ignorance, to be content with his seeming imperfections, and to\nrealize that \"whatever is, is right.\"\n\n\n'282 Our proper bliss:'\n\nour happiness as men.\n\n\n'283 point:'\n\nappointed place in the universe.\n\n\n'286 Secure:'\n\nsure.\n\n\n'289'\n\nHobbes, an English philosopher with whose work Pope was, no doubt,\nacquainted, says, \"Nature is the art whereby God governs the world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\nAN EPISTLE TO DR ARBUTHNOT\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\nNext to 'The Rape of the Lock', I think, the 'Epistle to Arbuthnot' is\nthe most interesting and the most important of Pope's poems--the most\nimportant since it shows the master poet of the age employing his\nripened powers in the field most suitable for their display, that of\npersonal satire, the most interesting, because, unlike his former\nsatiric poem the 'Dunciad', it is not mere invective, but gives us, as\nno other poem of Pope's can be said to do, a portrait of the poet\nhimself.\n\nLike most of Pope's poems, the 'Epistle to Arbuthnot' owes its existence\nto an objective cause. This was the poet's wish to justify himself\nagainst a series of savage attacks, which had recently been directed\nagainst him. If Pope had expected by the publication of the 'Dunciad' to\ncrush the herd of scribblers who had been for years abusing him, he must\nhave been woefully disappointed. On the contrary, the roar of insult and\ncalumny rose louder than ever, and new voices were added to the chorus.\nIn the year 1733 two enemies entered the field against Pope such as he\nhad never yet had to encounter--enemies of high social position, of\nacknowledged wit, and of a certain, though as the sequel proved quite\ninadequate, talent for satire. These were Lady Mary Wortley Montague and\nLord John Hervey.\n\nLady Mary had been for years acknowledged as one of the wittiest, most\nlearned, and most beautiful women of her day. Pope seems to have met her\nin 1715 and at once joined the train of her admirers. When she\naccompanied her husband on his embassy to Constantinople in the\nfollowing year, the poet entered into a long correspondence with her,\nprotesting in the most elaborate fashion his undying devotion. On her\nreturn he induced her to settle with her husband at Twickenham. Here he\ncontinued his attentions, half real, half in the affected gallantry of\nthe day, until, to quote the lady's own words to her daughter many years\nafter, \"at some ill-chosen time when she least expected what romancers\ncall a declaration, he made such passionate love to her, as, in spite of\nher utmost endeavours to be angry and look grave, provoked an immoderate\nfit of laughter,\" and, she added, from that moment Pope became her\nimplacable enemy. Certainly by the time Pope began to write the\n'Dunciad' he was so far estranged from his old friend that he permitted\nhimself in that poem a scoffing allusion to a scandal in which she had\nrecently become involved. The lady answered, or the poet thought that\nshe did, with an anonymous pamphlet, 'A Pop upon Pope', describing a\ncastigation, wholly imaginary, said to have been inflicted upon the poet\nas a proper reward for his satire. After this, of course, all hope of a\nreconciliation was at an end, and in his satires and epistles Pope\nrepeatedly introduced Lady Mary under various titles in the most\noffensive fashion. In his first 'Imitation of Horace', published in\nFebruary, 1733, he referred in the most unpardonable manner to a certain\nSappho, and the dangers attendant upon any acquaintance with her. Lady\nMary was foolish enough to apply the lines to herself and to send a\ncommon friend to remonstrate with Pope. He coolly replied that he was\nsurprised that Lady Mary should feel hurt, since the lines could only\napply to certain women, naming four notorious scribblers, whose lives\nwere as immoral as their works. Such an answer was by no means\ncalculated to turn away the lady's wrath, and for an ally in the\ncampaign of anonymous abuse that she now planned she sought out her\nfriend Lord Hervey. John Hervey, called by courtesy Lord Hervey, the\nsecond son of the Earl of Bristol, was one of the most prominent figures\nat the court of George II. He had been made vice-chamberlain of the\nroyal household in 1730, and was the intimate friend and confidential\nadviser of Queen Caroline. Clever, affable, unprincipled, and cynical,\nhe was a perfect type of the Georgian courtier to whom loyalty,\npatriotism, honesty, and honor were so many synonyms for folly. He was\neffeminate in habits and appearance, but notoriously licentious; he\naffected to scoff at learning but made some pretense to literature, and\nhad written 'Four Epistles after the Manner of Ovid', and numerous\npolitical pamphlets. Pope, who had some slight personal acquaintance\nwith him, disliked his political connections and probably despised his\nverses, and in the 'Imitation' already mentioned had alluded to him\nunder the title of Lord Fanny as capable of turning out a thousand lines\nof verse a day. This was sufficient cause, if cause were needed, to\ninduce Hervey to join Lady Mary in her warfare against Pope.\n\nThe first blow was struck in an anonymous poem, probably the combined\nwork of the two allies, called 'Verses addressed to the Imitator of\nHorace', which appeared in March, 1733, and it was followed up in August\nby an 'Epistle from a Nobleman to a Doctor of Divinity', which also\nappeared anonymously, but was well known to be the work of Lord Hervey.\nIn these poems Pope was abused in the most unmeasured terms. His work\nwas styled a mere collection of libels; he had no invention except in\ndefamation; he was a mere pretender to genius. His morals were not left\nunimpeached; he was charged with selling other men's work printed in his\nname,--a gross distortion of his employing assistants in the translation\nof the 'Odyssey',--he was ungrateful, unjust, a foe to human kind, an\nenemy like the devil to all that have being. The noble authors, probably\nwell aware how they could give the most pain, proceeded to attack his\nfamily and his distorted person. His parents were obscure and vulgar\npeople; and he himself a wretched outcast:\n\n  with the emblem of [his] crooked mind\n  Marked on [his] back like Cain by God's own hand.\n\nAnd to cap the climax, as soon as these shameful libels were in print,\nLord Hervey bustled off to show them to the Queen and to laugh with her\nover the fine way in which he had put down the bitter little poet.\n\nIn order to understand and appreciate Pope's reception of these attacks,\nwe must recall to ourselves the position in which he lived. He was a\nCatholic, and I have already (Introduction, p. x) called attention to\nthe precarious, tenure by which the Catholics of his time held their\ngoods, their persons, their very lives, in security. He was the intimate\nof Bolingbroke, of all men living the most detested by the court, and\nhis noble friends were almost without exception the avowed enemies of\nthe court party. Pope had good reason to fear that the malice of his\nenemies might not be content to stop with abusive doggerel. But he was\nnot in the least intimidated. On the contrary, he broke out in a fine\nflame of wrath against Lord Hervey, whom he evidently considered the\nchief offender, challenged his enemy to disavow the 'Epistle', and on\nhis declining to do so, proceeded to make what he called \"a proper\nreply\" in a prose 'Letter to a Noble Lord'. This masterly piece of\nsatire was passed about from hand to hand, but never printed. We are\ntold that Sir Robert Walpole, who found Hervey a convenient tool in\ncourt intrigues, bribed Pope not to print it by securing a good position\nin France for one of the priests who had watched over the poet's youth.\nIf this story be true, and we have Horace Walpole's authority for it, we\nmay well imagine that the entry of the bribe, like that of Uncle Toby's\noath, was blotted out by a tear from the books of the Recording Angel.\n\nBut Pope was by no means disposed to let the attacks go without an\nanswer of some kind, and the particular form which his answer took seems\nto have been suggested by a letter from Arbuthnot. \"I make it my last\nrequest,\" wrote his beloved physician, now sinking fast under the\ndiseases that brought him to the grave, \"that you continue that noble\ndisdain and abhorrence of vice, which you seem so naturally endued with,\nbut still with a due regard to your own safety; and study more to reform\nthan to chastise, though the one often cannot be effected without the\nother.\" \"I took very kindly your advice,\" Pope replied, \"... and it has\nworked so much upon me considering the time and state you gave it in,\nthat I determined to address to you one of my epistles written by\npiecemeal many years, and which I have now made haste to put together;\nwherein the question is stated, what were, and are my motives of\nwriting, the objections to them, and my answers.\" In other words, the\n'Epistle to Arbuthnot' which we see that Pope was working over at the\ndate of this letter, August 25, 1734, was, in the old-fashioned phrase,\nhis 'Apologia', his defense of his life and work.\n\nAs usual, Pope's account of his work cannot be taken literally. A\ncomparison of dates shows that the 'Epistle' instead of having been\n\"written by piecemeal many years\" is essentially the work of one\nimpulse, the desire to vindicate his character, his parents, and his\nwork from the aspersions cast upon them by Lord Hervey and Lady Mary.\nThe exceptions to this statement are two, or possibly three, passages\nwhich we know to have been written earlier and worked into the poem with\ninfinite art.\n\nThe first of these is the famous portrait of Addison as Atticus. I have\nalready spoken of the reasons that led to Pope's breach with Addison\n(Introduction, p. xv); and there is good reason to believe that this\nportrait sprang directly from Pope's bitter feeling toward the elder\nwriter for his preference of Tickell's translation. The lines were\ncertainly written in Addison's lifetime, though we may be permitted to\ndoubt whether Pope really did send them to him, as he once asserted.\nThey did not appear in print, however, till four years after Addison's\ndeath, when they were printed apparently without Pope's consent in a\nvolume of miscellanies. It is interesting to note that in this form the\nfull name \"Addison\" appeared in the last line. Some time later Pope\nacknowledged the verses and printed them with a few changes in his\n'Miscellany' of 1727, substituting the more decorous \"A---n\" for the\n\"Addison\" of the first text. Finally he worked over the passage again\nand inserted it, for a purpose that will be shown later, in the 'Epistle\nto Arbuthnot'.\n\nIt is not worth while to discuss here the justice or injustice of this\nfamous portrait. In fact, the question hardly deserves to be raised. The\npassage is admittedly a satire, and a satire makes no claim to be a just\nand final sentence. Admitting, as we must, that Pope was in the wrong in\nhis quarrel with Addison, we may well admit that he has not done him\nfull justice. But we must equally admit that the picture is drawn with\nwonderful skill, that praise and blame are deftly mingled, and that the\nsatire is all the more severe because of its frank admission of the\ngreat man's merits. And it must also be said that Pope has hit off some\nof the faults of Addison's character,--his coldness, his\nself-complacency, his quiet sneer, his indulgence of flattering\nfools--in a way that none of his biographers have done. That Pope was\nnot blind to Addison's chief merit as an author is fully shown by a\npassage in a later poem, less well known than the portrait of Atticus,\nbut well worth quotation. After speaking of the licentiousness of\nliterature in Restoration days, he goes on to say:\n\n  In our own (excuse some courtly stains)\n  No whiter page than Addison's remains,\n  He from the taste obscene reclaims our youth,\n  And sets the passions on the side of truth,\n  Forms the soft bosom with the gentlest art,\n  And pours each human virtue in the heart.\n\n  'Epistle to Augustus, II'. 215-220.\n\nIf Pope was unjust to Addison the man, he at least made amends to\nAddison the moralist.\n\nThe second passage that may have had an independent existence before the\n'Epistle' was conceived is the portrait of Bufo, ll. 229-247. There is\nreason to believe that this attack was first aimed at Bubb Doddington, a\ncourtier of Hervey's class, though hardly of so finished a type, to whom\nPope alludes as Bubo in l. 278. When Pope was working on the 'Epistle',\nhowever, he saw an opportunity to vindicate his own independence of\npatronage by a satiric portrait of the great Maecenas of his younger\ndays, Lord Halifax, who had ventured some foolish criticisms on Pope's\ntranslation of the 'Iliad', and seems to have expected that the poet\nshould dedicate the great work to him in return for an offer of a\npension which he made and Pope declined. There is no reason to believe\nthat Pope cherished any very bitter resentment toward Halifax. On the\ncontrary, in a poem published some years after the 'Epistle' he boasted\nof his friendship with Halifax, naming him outright, and adding in a\nnote that the noble lord was no less distinguished by his love of\nletters than his abilities in Parliament.\n\nThe third passage, a tender reference to his mother's age and weakness,\nwas written at least as early as 1731,--Mrs. Pope died in 1733,--and was\nincorporated in the 'Epistle' to round it off with a picture of the poet\nabsorbed in his filial duties at the very time that Hervey and Lady Mary\nwere heaping abuse upon him, as a monster devoid of all good qualities.\nAnd now having discussed the various insertions in the 'Epistle', let us\nlook for a moment at the poem as a whole, and see what is the nature of\nPope's defense of himself and of his reply to his enemies.\n\nIt is cast in the form of a dialogue between the poet himself and\nArbuthnot. Pope begins by complaining of the misfortunes which his\nreputation as a successful man of letters has brought upon him. He is a\nmark for all the starving scribblers of the town who besiege him for\nadvice, recommendations, and hard cash. Is it not enough to make a man\nwrite 'Dunciads?' Arbuthnot warns him against the danger of making foes\n(ll. 101- 104), but Pope replies that his flatterers are even more\nintolerable than his open enemies. And with a little outburst of\nimpatience, such as we may well imagine him to have indulged in during\nhis later years, he cries:\n\n  Why did I write? What sin to me unknown\n  Dipt me in ink, my parents' or my own?\n\nand begins with l. 125 his poetical autobiography. He tells of his first\nchildish efforts, of poetry taken up \"to help me thro' this long disease\nmy life,\" and then goes on to speak of the noble and famous friends who\nhad praised his early work and urged him to try his fortune in the open\nfield of letters. He speaks of his first poems, the 'Pastorals' and\n'Windsor Forest', harmless as Hervey's own verses, and tells how even\nthen critics like Dennis fell foul of him. Rival authors hated him, too,\nespecially such pilfering bards as Philips. This he could endure, but\nthe coldness and even jealousy of such a man as Addison--and here\nappears the famous portrait of Atticus--was another matter, serious\nenough to draw tears from all lovers of mankind.\n\nPassing on (l. 213) to the days of his great success when his 'Homer'\nwas the talk of the town, he asserts his ignorance of all the arts of\npuffery and his independence of mutual admiration societies. He left\nthose who wished a patron to the tender mercies of Halifax, who fed fat\non flattery and repaid his flatterers merely with a good word or a seat\nat his table. After all, the poet could afford to lose the society of\nBufo's toadies while such a friend as Gay was left him (l. 254).\n\nAfter an eloquent expression of his wish for independence (ll. 261-270),\nhe goes on to speak of the babbling friends who insist that he is always\nmeditating some new satire, and persist in recognizing some wretched\npoetaster's lampoon as his. And so by a natural transition Pope comes to\nspeak of his own satiric poems and their aims. He says, and rightly,\nthat he has never attacked virtue or innocence. He reserves his lash for\nthose who trample on their neighbors and insult \"fallen worth,\" for cold\nor treacherous friends, liars, and babbling blockheads. Let Sporus\n(Hervey) tremble (l. 303). Arbuthnot interposes herewith an ejaculation\nof contemptuous pity; is it really worth the poet's while to castigate\nsuch a slight thing as Hervey, that \"mere white curd\"? But Pope has\nsuffered too much from Hervey's insolence to stay his hand, and he now\nproceeds to lay on the lash with equal fury and precision, drawing blood\nat every stroke, until we seem to see the wretched fop writhing and\nshrieking beneath the whip. And then with a magnificent transition he\ngoes on (ll. 332-337) to draw a portrait of himself. Here, he says in\neffect, is the real man that Sporus has so maligned. The portrait is\nidealized, of course; one could hardly expect a poet speaking in his own\ndefense in reply to venomous attacks to dissect his own character with\nthe stern impartiality of the critics of the succeeding century, but it\nis in all essentials a portrait at once impressive and true.\n\nArbuthnot again interrupts (l. 358) to ask why he spares neither the\npoor nor the great in his satire, and Pope replies that he hates knaves\nin every rank of life. Yet by nature, he insists, he is of an easy\ntemper, more readily deceived than angered, and in a long catalogue of\ninstances he illustrates his own patience and good nature (ll. 366-385).\nIt must be frankly confessed that these lines do not ring true. Pope\nmight in the heat of argument convince himself that he was humble and\nslow to wrath, but he has never succeeded in convincing his readers.\n\nWith l. 382 Pope turns to the defense of his family, which, as we have\nseen, his enemies had abused as base and obscure. He draws a noble\npicture of his dead father, \"by nature honest, by experience wise\"\nsimple, modest, and temperate, and passes to the description of himself\nwatching over the last years of his old mother, his sole care to\n\n  Explore the thought, explain the asking eye\n  And keep a while one parent from the sky.\n\nIf the length of days which Heaven has promised those who honor father\nand mother fall to his lot, may Heaven preserve him such a friend as\nArbuthnot to bless those days. And Arbuthnot closes the dialogue with a\nword which is meant, I think, to sum up the whole discussion and to\npronounce the verdict that Pope's life had been good and honorable.\n\n  Whether that blessing [1] be deny'd or giv'n,\n  Thus far was right, the rest belongs to Heav'n.\n\nIt seems hardly necessary to point out the merits of so patent a\nmasterpiece as the 'Epistle to Arbuthnot'. In order to enjoy it to the\nfull, indeed, one must know something of the life of the author, of the\ncircumstances under which it was written, and, in general, of the social\nand political life of the time. But even without this special knowledge\nno reader can fail to appreciate the marvelous ease, fluency, and\npoignancy of this admirable satire. There is nothing like it in our\nlanguage except Pope's other satires, and of all his satires it is, by\ncommon consent, easily the first. It surpasses the satiric poetry of\nDryden in pungency and depth of feeling as easily as it does that of\nByron in polish and artistic restraint. Its range of tone is remarkable.\nAt times it reads like glorified conversation, as in the opening lines;\nat times it flames and quivers with emotion, as in the assault on\nHervey, or in the defense of his parents. Even in the limited field of\nsatiric portraiture there is a wide difference between the manner in\nwhich Pope has drawn the portrait of Atticus and that of Sporus. The\nlatter is a masterpiece of pure invective; no allowances are made, no\nlights relieve the darkness of the shadows, the portrait is frankly\ninhuman. It is the product of an unrestrained outburst of bitter\npassion. The portrait of Atticus, on the other hand, was, as we know,\nthe work of years. It is the product not of an outburst of fury, but of\na slowly growing and intense dislike, which, while recognizing the\nmerits of its object, fastened with peculiar power upon his faults and\nweaknesses. The studious restraint which controls the satirist's hand\nmakes it only the more effective. We know well enough that the portrait\nis not a fair one, but we are forced to remind ourselves of this at\nevery step to avoid the spell which Pope's apparent impartiality casts\nover our judgments. The whole passage reads not so much like the heated\nplea of an advocate as the measured summing-up of a judge, and the last\ncouplet falls on our ears with the inevitability of a final sentence.\nBut the peculiar merit of the 'Epistle to Arbuthnot' consists neither in\nthe ease and polish of its style, nor in the vigor and effectiveness of\nits satire, but in the insight it gives us into the heart and mind of\nthe poet himself. It presents an ideal picture of Pope, the man and the\nauthor, of his life, his friendships, his love of his parents, his\nliterary relationships and aims. And it is quite futile to object, as\nsome critics have done, that this picture is not exactly in accordance\nwith the known facts of Pope's life. No great man can be tried and\njudged on the mere record of his acts. We must know the circumstances\nthat shaped these, and the motives that inspired them. A man's ideals,\nif genuinely held and honestly followed, are perhaps even more valuable\ncontributions to our final estimate of the man himself than all he did\nor left undone.\n\n  All I could never be,\n  All, men ignored in me,\n  This, I was worth to God, whose wheel the pitcher shaped.\n\nAnd in the 'Epistle to Arbuthnot' we recognize in Pope ideals of\nindependence, of devotion to his art, of simple living, of loyal\nfriendship, and of filial piety which shine in splendid contrast with\nthe gross, servile, and cynically immoral tone of the age and society in\nwhich he lived.\n\n\n\n[Footnote 1: i. e. the blessing of Arbuthnot's future companionship,\nfor which Pope (l. 413) had just prayed.]\n\n\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDr. John Arbuthnot, one of Pope's most intimate friends, had been\nphysician to Queen Anne, and was a man of letters as well as a doctor.\nArbuthnot, Pope, and Swift had combined to get out a volume of\nMiscellanies in 1737.

As they could\nnot be arrested anywhere on Sunday, Pope represents them as taking that\nday to inflict their visits on him.\n\n\n'15 Parson:'\n\nprobably a certain Eusden, who had some pretensions to letters, but who\nruined himself by drink.\n\n\n'17 Clerk:'\n\na law clerk.\n\n\n'18 engross:'\n\nwrite legal papers.\n\n\n'19-20'\n\nAn imaginary portrait of a mad poet who keeps on writing verses even in\nhis cell in Bedlam. Pope may have been thinking of Lee, a dramatist of\nDryden's day who was confined for a time in this asylum.\n\n\n'23 Arthur:'\n\nArthur Moore, a member of Parliament for some years and well known in\nLondon society. His \"giddy son,\" James Moore, who took the name of Moore\nSmythe, dabbled in letters and was a bitter enemy of Pope.\n\n\n'25 Cornus:'\n\nRobert Lord Walpole, whose wife deserted him in 1734. Horace Walpole\nspeaks of her as half mad.\n\n\n'31 sped:'\n\ndone for.\n\n\n'40'\n\nPope's counsel to delay the publication of the works read to him is\nborrowed from Horace: \"nonumque prematur in annum\" '(Ars Poetica, 388).'\n\n\n'41 Drury-lane,'\n\nlike Grub Street, a haunt of poor authors at this time.\n\n\n'43 before Term ends:'\n\nbefore the season is over; that is, as soon as the poem is written.\n\n\n'48 a Prologue:'\n\nfor a play. Of course a prologue by the famous Mr. Pope would be of\ngreat value to a poor and unknown dramatist.\n\n\n'49 Pitholeon:'\n\nthe name of a foolish poet mentioned by Horace. Pope uses it here for\nhis enemy Welsted, mentioned in l. 373.--'his Grace:' the title given a\nDuke in Great Britain. The Duke here referred to is said to be the Duke\nof Argyle, one of the most influential of the great Whig lords.\n\n\n'53 Curll':\n\na notorious publisher of the day, and an enemy of Pope. The implication\nis that if Pope will not grant Pitholeon's request, the latter will\naccept Curll's invitation and concoct a new libel against the poet.\n\n\n'60'\n\nPope was one of the few men of letters of his day who had not written a\nplay, and he was at this time on bad terms with certain actors.\n\n\n'62'\n\nBernard Lintot, the publisher of Pope's translation of Homer.\n\n\n'66 go snacks':\n\nshare the profits. Pope represents the unknown dramatist as trying to\nbribe him to give a favorable report of the play.\n\n\n'69 Midas':\n\nan old legend tells us that Midas was presented with a pair of ass's\nears by an angry god whose music he had slighted. His barber, or,\nChaucer says, his queen, discovered the change which Midas had tried to\nconceal, and unable to keep the secret whispered it to the reeds in the\nriver, who straightway spread the news abroad.\n\n\n'75'\n\nWith this line Arbuthnot is supposed to take up the conversation. This\nis indicated here and elsewhere by the letter A.\n\n\n'79 Dunciad':\n\nsee Introduction, p. xviii.\n\n\n'85 Codrus':\n\na name borrowed from Juvenal to denote a foolish poet. Pope uses it here\nfor some conceited dramatist who thinks none the less of himself because\nhis tragedy is rejected with shouts of laughter.\n\n\n'96'\n\nExplain the exact meaning of this line.\n\n\n'97 Bavius':\n\na stock name for a bad poet. See note on 'Essay on Criticism', l. 34.\n\n\n'98 Philips':\n\nAmbrose Philips, author among other things of a set of 'Pastorals' that\nappeared in the same volume with Pope, 1709. Pope and he soon became\nbitter enemies. He was patronized by a Bishop Boulter.\n\n\n'99 Sappho':\n\nHere as elsewhere Pope uses the name of the Greek poetess for his enemy,\nLady Mary Wortley Montague.\n\n\n'109 Grubstreet':\n\na wretched street in London, inhabited in Pope's day by hack writers,\nmost of whom were his enemies.\n\n\n'111 Curll'\n\n(see note to l. 53) had printed a number of Pope's letters without the\npoet's consent some years before this poem was written.\n\n\n'113-132'\n\nPope here describes the flatterers who were foolish enough to pay him\npersonal compliments. They compare him to Horace who was short like\nPope, though fat, and who seems to have suffered from colds; also to\nAlexander, one of whose shoulders was higher than the other, and to\nOvid, whose other name, Naso, might indicate that long noses were a\ncharacteristic feature of his family. Pope really had large and\nbeautiful eyes. Maro, l. 122, is Virgil.\n\n\n'123'\n\nWith this line Pope begins an account of his life as a poet. For his\nprecocity, see Introduction, p. xii.\n\n\n'129 ease:'\n\namuse, entertain.\n\n\n'friend, not Wife:'\n\nthe reference is, perhaps, to Martha Blount, Pope's friend, and may have\nbeen meant as a contradiction of his reported secret marriage to her.\n\n\n'132 to bear:'\n\nto endure the pains and troubles of an invalid's life.\n\n\n'133 Granville:'\n\nGeorge Granville, Lord Lansdowne, a poet and patron of letters to whom\nPope had dedicated his 'Windsor Forest.'\n\n\n'134 Walsh:'\n\nsee note on 'Essay on Criticism,' l. 729.\n\n\n'135 Garth:'\n\nSir Samuel Garth, like Arbuthnot, a doctor, a man of letters, and an\nearly friend of Pope.\n\n\n'137'\n\nCharles Talbot, Duke of Shrewsbury; John, Lord Somers; and John\nSheffield, Duke of Buckingham; all leading statesmen and patrons of\nliterature in Queen Anne's day.\n\n\n'138 Rochester:'\n\nFrancis Atterbury, Bishop of Rochester, an intimate friend of Pope.\n\n\n'139 St. John:'\n\nBolingbroke. For Pope's relations with him, see introduction to the\n'Essay on Man,' p. 116.\n\n\n'143'\n\nGilbert Burnet and John Oldmixon had written historical works from the\nWhig point of view. Roger Cooke, a now forgotten writer, had published a\n'Detection of the Court and State of England.' Pope in a note on this\nline calls them all three authors of secret and scandalous history.\n\n\n'146'\n\nThe reference is to Pope's early descriptive poems, the 'Pastorals' and\n'Windsor Forest.'\n\n\n'147 gentle Fanny's:'\n\na sneer at Lord Hervey's verses. See the introduction to this poem, p.\n126.\n\n\n'149 Gildon:'\n\na critic of the time who had repeatedly attacked Pope. The poet told\nSpence that he had heard Addison gave Gildon ten pounds to slander him.\n\n\n'151 Dennis:'\n\nsee note on 'Essay on Criticism.' l. 270.\n\n\n'156 kiss'd the rod:'\n\nPope was sensible enough to profit by the criticisms even of his\nenemies. He corrected several passages in the 'Essay on Criticism' which\nDennis had properly found fault with.\n\n\n'162 Bentley:'\n\nthe most famous scholar of Pope's day. Pope disliked him because of his\ncriticism of the poet's translation of the 'Iliad', \"good verses, but\nnot Homer.\" The epithet \"slashing\" refers to Bentley's edition of\n'Paradise Lost' in which he altered and corrected the poet's text to\nsuit his own ideas.\n\n'Tibbalds':\n\nLewis Theobald (pronounced Tibbald), a scholar who had attacked Pope's\nedition of Shakespeare. Pope calls him \"piddling\" because of his\nscrupulous attention to details.\n\n\n'177 The Bard':\n\nPhilips, see note on l. 98. Pope claimed that Philips's 'Pastorals' were\nplagiarized from Spenser, and other poets. Philips, also, translated\nsome 'Persian Tales' for the low figure of half a crown apiece.\n\n\n'187 bade translate':\n\nsuggested that they translate other men's work, since they could write\nnothing valuable of their own.\n\n\n'188 Tate':\n\na poetaster of the generation before Pope. He is remembered as the part\nauthor of a doggerel version of the Psalms.\n\n\n'191-212'\n\nFor a discussion of this famous passage, see introduction to the\n'Epistle' p. 130.\n\n\n'196 the Turk':\n\nit was formerly the practice for a Turkish monarch when succeeding to\nthe throne to have all his brothers murdered so as to do away with\npossible rivals.\n\n\n'199 faint praise':\n\nAddison was hearty enough when he cared to praise his friends. Pope is\nthinking of the coldness with which Addison treated his 'Pastorals' as\ncompared to those of Philips.\n\n\n'206 oblig'd':\n\nnote the old-fashioned pronunciation to rhyme with \"besieged.\"\n\n\n'207 Cato':\n\nan unmistakable allusion to Addison's tragedy in which the famous Roman\nappears laying down the law to the remnants of the Senate.\n\n\n'209 Templars':\n\nstudents of law at the \"Temple\" in London who prided themselves on their\ngood taste in literature. A body of them came on purpose to applaud\n'Cato' on the first night.\n\n'raise':\n\nexalt, praise.\n\n\n'211-212 laugh ... weep':\n\nexplain the reason for these actions.\n\n'Atticus':\n\nAddison's name was given in the first version of this passage. Then it\nwas changed to \"A---n.\" Addison had been mentioned in the 'Spectator'\n(No. 150) under the name of Atticus as \"in every way one of the greatest\ngeniuses the age has produced.\"\n\n\n'213 rubric on the walls':\n\nLintot, Pope's old publisher, used to stick up the titles of new books\nin red letters on the walls of his shop.\n\n\n'214 with claps':\n\nwith clap-bills, posters.\n\n\n'215 smoking:'\n\nhot from the press.\n\n\n'220 George:'\n\nGeorge II, king of England at this time. His indifference to literature\nwas notorious.\n\n\n'228 Bufo:'\n\nthe picture of a proud but grudging patron of letters which follows was\nfirst meant for Bubb Doddington, a courtier and patron of letters at the\ntime the poem was written. In order to connect it more closely with the\ntime of which he was writing, Pope added ll. 243-246, which pointed to\nCharles Montague, Earl of Halifax. Halifax was himself a poet and\naffected to be a great patron of poetry, but his enemies accused him of\nonly giving his clients \"good words and good dinners.\" Pope tells an\namusing story of Montague's comments on his translation of the 'Iliad'\n(Spence, 'Anecdotes', p. 134). But Halifax subscribed for ten copies of\nthe translation, so that Pope, at least, could not complain of his lack\nof generosity.\n\n'Castalian state:'\n\nthe kingdom of poets.\n\n\n'232'\n\nHis name was coupled with that of Horace as a poet and critic.\n\n\n'234 Pindar without a head:'\n\nsome headless statue which Bufo insisted was a genuine classic figure of\nPindar, the famous Greek lyric poet.\n\n\n'237 his seat:'\n\nhis country seat.\n\n\n'242 paid in kind:'\n\nWhat does this phrase mean?\n\n\n'243'\n\nDryden died in 1700. He had been poor and obliged to work hard for a\nliving in his last years, but hardly had to starve. Halifax offered to\npay the expenses of his funeral and contribute five hundred pounds for a\nmonument, and Pope not unreasonably suggests that some of this bounty\nmight have been bestowed on Dryden in his lifetime.\n\n\n'249'\n\nWhen a politician wants a writer to put in a day's work in defending\nhim. Walpole, for example, who cared nothing for poetry, spent large\nsums in retaining writers to defend him in the journals and pamphlets of\nthe day.\n\n\n'254'\n\nJohn Gay, the author of some very entertaining verses, was an intimate\nfriend of Pope. On account of some supposed satirical allusions his\nopera 'Polly' was refused a license, and when his friends, the Duke and\nDuchess of Queensberry (see l. 260) solicited subscriptions for it in\nthe palace, they were driven from the court. Gay died in 1732, and Pope\nwrote an epitaph for his tomb in Westminster Abbey. It is to this that\nhe alludes in l. 258.\n\n\n'274'\n\nBalbus is said to mean the Earl of Kinnoul, at one time an acquaintance\nof Pope and Swift.\n\n\n'278'\n\nSir William Yonge, a Whig politician whom Pope disliked. He seems to\nhave written occasional verses. Bubo is Bubo Doddington (see note on l\n230).\n\n\n'297-298'\n\nIn the Fourth Moral Essay, published in 1731 as an 'Epistle to the Earl\nof Burlington', Pope had given a satirical description of a nobleman's\nhouse and grounds, adorned and laid out at vast expense, but in bad\ntaste. Certain features of this description were taken from Canons, the\nsplendid country place of the Duke of Chandos, and the duke was at once\nidentified by a scandal-loving public with the Timon of the poem. In the\ndescription Pope speaks of the silver bell which calls worshipers to\nTimon's chapel, and of the soft Dean preaching there \"who never mentions\nHell to ears polite.\" In this passage of the 'Epistle to Arbuthnot' he\nis protesting against the people who swore that they could identify the\nbell and the Dean as belonging to the chapel at Canons.\n\n\n'303 Sporus':\n\na favorite of Nero, used here for Lord Hervey. See introduction to this\npoem, p. 128.\n\n\n'304 ass's milk':\n\nHervey was obliged by bad health to keep a strict diet, and a cup of\nass's milk was his daily drink.\n\n\n'308 painted child':\n\nHervey was accustomed to paint his face like a woman.\n\n\n'317-319'\n\nPope is thinking of Milton's striking description of Satan \"squat like a\ntoad\" by the ear of the sleeping Eve ('Paradise Lost', IV, 800). In this\npassage \"Eve\" refers to Queen Caroline with whom Hervey was on intimate\nterms. It is said that he used to have a seat in the queen's hunting\nchaise \"where he sat close behind her perched at her ear.\"\n\n\n'322 now master up, now miss':\n\nPope borrowed this telling phrase from a pamphlet against Hervey written\nby Pulteney, a political opponent, in which the former is called \"a\npretty little master-miss.\"\n\n\n'326 the board':\n\nthe Council board where Hervey sat as member of the Privy Council.\n\n\n'328-329'\n\nAn allusion to the old pictures of the serpent in Eden with a snake's\nbody and a woman's, or angel's, face.\n\n\n'330 parts':\n\ntalents, natural gifts.\n\n\n'338-339'\n\nAn allusion to Pope's abandoning the imaginative topics to his early\npoems, as the 'Pastorals' and 'The Rape of the Lock', and turning to\ndidactic verse as in the 'Essay on Man', and the 'Moral Epistles'.\n\n\n'347'\n\nAn allusion to a story circulated, in an abusive pamphlet called 'A Pop\nupon Pope', that the poet had been whipped for his satire and that he\nhad cried like a child.\n\n\n'349'\n\nDull and scandalous poems printed under Pope's name, or attributed to\nhim by his enemies.\n\n\n'351 the pictur'd shape':\n\nPope was especially hurt by the caricatures which exaggerated his\npersonal deformity.\n\n\n'353 A friend in exile':\n\nprobably Bishop Atterbury, then in exile for his Jacobite opinions.\n\n\n'354-355'\n\nAnother reference to Hervey who was suspected of poisoning the mind of\nthe King against Pope.\n\n\n'361 Japhet':\n\nJaphet Crooke, a notorious forger of the time. He died in prison in\n1734, after having had his nose slit and ears cropped for his crimes;\nsee below, l. 365.\n\n\n'363 Knight of the post':\n\na slang term for a professional witness ready to, swear to anything for\nmoney. A knight of the shire, on the other hand, is the representative\nof a county in the House of Commons.\n\n\n'367 bit':\n\ntricked, taken in, a piece of Queen Anne slang. The allusion is probably\nto the way in which Lady Mary Wortley Montague allowed Pope to make love\nto her and then laughed at him.\n\n\n'369 friend to his distress':\n\nin 1733, when old Dennis was in great poverty, a play was performed for\nhis benefit, for which Pope obligingly wrote a prologue.\n\n\n'371'\n\nColley Gibber, actor and poet laureate. Pope speaks as if it were an act\nof condescension for him to have drunk with Gibber.--'Moore': James\nMoore Smythe (see note on l. 23), whom Pope used to meet at the house of\nthe Blounts. He wrote a comedy, 'The Rival Modes', in which he\nintroduced six lines that Pope had written. Pope apparently had given\nhim leave to do so, and then retracted his permission. But Moore used\nthem without the permission and an undignified quarrel arose as to the\ntrue authorship of the passage.\n\n\n'373 Welsted',\n\na hack writer of the day, had falsely charged Pope with being\nresponsible for the death of the lady who is celebrated in Pope's 'Elegy\nto the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady'.\n\n\n'374-375'\n\nThere is an allusion here that has never been fully explained. Possibly\nthe passage refers to Teresa Blount whom Pope suspected of having\ncirculated slanderous reports concerning his relations with her sister.\n\n\n'376-377'\n\nSuffered Budgell to attribute to his (Pope's) pen the slanderous gossip\nof the 'Grub Street Journal',--a paper to which Pope did, as a matter of\nfact, contribute--and let him (Budgell) write anything he pleased except\nhis (Pope's) will. Budgell, a distant cousin of Addison's, fell into bad\nhabits after his friend's death. He was strongly suspected of having\nforged a will by which Dr. Tindal of Oxford left him a considerable sum\nof money. He finally drowned himself in the Thames.\n\n\n'378 the two Curlls':\n\nCurll, the bookseller, and Lord Hervey whom Pope here couples with him\nbecause of Hervey's vulgar abuse of Pope's personal deformities and\nobscure parentage.\n\n\n'380 Yet why':\n\nWhy should they abuse Pope's inoffensive parents? Compare the following\nlines.\n\n\n'383'\n\nMoore's own mother was suspected of loose conduct.\n\n\n'386-388 Of gentle blood ... each parent':\n\nPope asserted, perhaps incorrectly, that his father belonged to a\ngentleman's family, the head of which was the Earl of Downe. His mother\nwas the daughter of a Yorkshire gentleman, who lost two sons in the\nservice of Charles I (cf. l. 386).\n\n\n'389 Bestia':\n\nprobably the elder Horace Walpole, who was in receipt of a handsome\npension.\n\n\n'391'\n\nAn allusion to Addison's unhappy marriage with the Countess of Warwick.\n\n\n'393 The good man':\n\nPope's father, who as a devout Roman Catholic refused to take the oath\nof allegiance (cf. l. 395), or risk the equivocations sanctioned by the\n\"schoolmen,\" 'i.e'. the Catholic casuists of the day (l. 398).\n\n\n'404 Friend':\n\nArbuthnot, to whom the epistle is addressed.\n\n\n'405-411'\n\nThe first draft of these appeared in a letter to Aaron Hill, September\n3, 1731, where Pope speaks of having sent them \"the other day to a\nparticular friend,\" perhaps the poet Thomson. Mrs. Pope, who was very\nold and feeble, was of course alive when they were first written, but\ndied more than a year before the passage appeared in its revised form in\nthis 'Epistle'.\n\n\n'412'\n\nAn allusion to the promise contained in the fifth commandment.\n\n\n'415 served a Queen':\n\nArbuthnot had been Queen Anne's doctor, but was driven out of his rooms\nin the palace after her death.\n\n\n'416 that blessing':\n\nlong life for Arbuthnot. It was, in fact, denied, for he died a month or\nso after the appearance of the 'Epistle'.\n\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nNOTES ON\n\n\nODE ON SOLITUDE\n\nPope says that this delightful little poem was written at the early age\nof twelve. It first appeared in a letter to his friend, Henry Cromwell,\ndated July 17, 1709. There are several variations between this first\nform and that in which it was finally published, and it is probable that\nPope thought enough of his boyish production to subject it to repeated\nrevision. Its spirit is characteristic of a side of Pope's nature that\nis often forgotten. He was, indeed, the poet of the society of his day,\nurban, cultured, and pleasure-loving; but to the end of his days he\nretained a love for the quiet charm of country life which he had come to\nfeel in his boyhood at Binfield, and for which he early withdrew from\nthe whirl and dissipations of London to the groves and the grotto of his\nvilla at Twickenham.\n\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\nNOTES ON\n\n\nTHE DESCENT OF DULLNESS\n\nIn the fourth book of the 'Dunciad', Pope abandons the satire on the\npretenders to literary fame which had run through the earlier books, and\nflies at higher game. He represents the Goddess Dullness as \"coming in\nher majesty to destroy Order and Science, and to substitute the Kingdom\nof the Dull upon earth.\" He attacks the pedantry and formalism of\nuniversity education in his day, the dissipation and false taste of the\ntraveled gentry, the foolish pretensions to learning of collectors and\nvirtuosi, and the daringly irreverent speculations of freethinkers and\ninfidels. At the close of the book he represents the Goddess as\ndismissing her worshipers with a speech which she concludes with \"a yawn\nof extraordinary virtue.\" Under its influence \"all nature nods,\" and\npulpits, colleges, and Parliament succumb. The poem closes with the\nmagnificent description of the descent of Dullness and her final\nconquest of art, philosophy, and religion. It is said that Pope himself\nadmired these lines so much that he could not repeat them without his\nvoice faltering with emotion. \"And well it might, sir,\" said Dr. Johnson\nwhen this anecdote was repeated to him, \"for they are noble lines.\" And\nThackeray in his lecture on Pope in 'The English Humorists' says:\n\n  \"In these astonishing lines Pope reaches, I think, to the very\n  greatest height which his sublime art has attained, and shows himself\n  the equal of all poets of all times. It is the brightest ardor, the\n  loftiest assertion of truth, the most generous wisdom, illustrated by\n  the noblest poetic figure, and spoken in words the aptest, grandest,\n  and most harmonious.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\nEPITAPH ON GAY\n\nJohn Gay, the idlest, best-natured, and best-loved man of letters of his\nday, was the special friend of Pope. His early work, 'The Shepherd's\nWeek', was planned as a parody on the 'Pastorals' of Pope's rival,\nAmbrose Philips, and Pope assisted him in the composition of his\nluckless farce, 'Three Hours after Marriage'. When Gay's opera 'Polly'\nwas forbidden by the licenser, and Gay's patrons, the Duke and Duchess\nof Queensberry, were driven from court for soliciting subscriptions for\nhim, Pope warmly espoused his cause. Gay died in 1732 and was buried in\nWestminster Abbey. Pope's epitaph for his tomb was first published in\nthe quarto edition of Pope's works in 1735--Johnson, in his discussion\nof Pope's epitaphs ('Lives of the Poets'), devotes a couple of pages of\nsomewhat captious criticism to these lines; but they have at least the\nvirtue of simplicity and sincerity, and are at once an admirable\nportrait of the man and a lasting tribute to the poet Gay.\n\n\n\n\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX\n\n\nTHE RAPE OF THE LOCK\n\n\n      Nolueram, Belinda, tuos violare capillos\n      Sed juvat, hoc precibus me tribuisse tuis.\n\n      MART.\n\n\n\nFIRST EDITION\n\n\n\n\nCANTO I\n\n\n  What dire offence from am'rous causes springs,\n  What mighty quarrels rise from trivial things,\n  I sing--This verse to C--l, Muse!

could compel\n  A well-bred lord t' assault a gentle belle?\n  O say what stranger cause, yet unexplored,\n  Could make a gentle belle reject a lord?                        10\n  And dwells such rage in softest bosoms then,\n  And lodge such daring souls in little men?\n\n  Sol through white curtains did his beams display,\n  And ope'd those eyes which brighter shine than they,\n  Shock just had giv'n himself the rousing shake,                 15\n  And nymphs prepared their chocolate to take;\n  Thrice the wrought slipper knocked against the ground,\n  And striking watches the tenth hour resound.\n  Belinda rose, and midst attending dames,\n  Launched on the bosom of the silver Thames:                     20\n  A train of well-dressed youths around her shone,\n  And ev'ry eye was fixed on her alone:\n  On her white breast a sparkling cross she wore\n  Which Jews might kiss and infidels adore.\n  Her lively looks a sprightly mind disclose,                     25\n  Quick as her eyes, and as unfixed as those:\n  Favours to none, to all she smiles extends;\n  Oft she rejects, but never once offends.\n  Bright as the sun, her eyes the gazers strike,\n  And, like the sun, they shine on all alike.                     30\n  Yet graceful ease, and sweetness void of pride,\n  Might hide her faults, if belles had faults to hide:\n  If to her share some female errors fall,\n  Look on her face, and you'll forgive 'em all.\n\n  This nymph, to the destruction of mankind,                      35\n  Nourished two locks, which graceful hung behind\n  In equal curls, and well conspired to deck\n  With shining ringlets her smooth iv'ry neck.\n  Love in these labyrinths his slaves detains,\n  And mighty hearts are held in slender chains.                   40\n  With hairy springes we the birds betray,\n  Slight lines of hair surprise the finny prey,\n  Fair tresses man's imperial race insnare,\n  And beauty draws us with a single hair.\n\n  Th' adventurous baron the bright locks admired;                 45\n  He saw, he wished, and to the prize aspired.\n  Resolved to win, he meditates the way,\n  By force to ravish, or by fraud betray;\n  For when success a lover's toil attends,\n  Few ask if fraud or force attained his ends.                    50\n\n  For this, ere Phoebus rose, he had implored\n  Propitious heav'n, and every pow'r adored,\n  But chiefly Love--to Love an altar built,\n  Of twelve vast French romances, neatly gilt.\n  There lay the sword-knot Sylvia's hands had sewn                55\n  With Flavia's busk that oft had wrapped his own:\n  A fan, a garter, half a pair of gloves,\n  And all the trophies of his former loves.\n  With tender billets-doux he lights the pire,\n  And breathes three am'rous sighs to raise the fire.             60\n  Then prostrate falls, and begs with ardent eyes\n  Soon to obtain, and long possess the prize:\n  The pow'rs gave ear, and granted half his pray'r,\n  The rest the winds dispersed in empty air.\n\n  Close by those meads, for ever crowned with flow'rs,            65\n  Where Thames with pride surveys his rising tow'rs,\n  There stands a structure of majestic frame,\n  Which from the neighb'ring Hampton takes its name.\n  Here Britain's statesmen oft the fall foredoom\n  Of foreign tyrants, and of nymphs at home;                      70\n  Here thou, great Anna! whom three realms obey,\n  Dost sometimes counsel take--and sometimes tea.\n\n  Hither our nymphs and heroes did resort,\n  To taste awhile the pleasures of a court;\n  In various talk the cheerful hours they passed,                 75\n  Of who was bit, or who capotted last;\n  This speaks the glory of the British queen,\n  And that describes a charming Indian screen;\n  A third interprets motions, looks, and eyes;\n  At ev'ry word a reputation dies.                                80\n  Snuff, or the fan, supply each pause of chat,\n  With singing, laughing, ogling, and all that.\n\n  Now when, declining from the noon of day,\n  The sun obliquely shoots his burning ray;\n  When hungry judges soon the sentence sign,                      85\n  And wretches hang that jurymen may dine;\n  When merchants from th' Exchange return in peace,\n  And the long labours of the toilet cease,\n  The board's with cups and spoons, alternate, crowned,\n  The berries crackle, and the mill turns round;                  90\n  On shining altars of Japan they raise\n  The silver lamp, and fiery spirits blaze:\n  From silver spouts the grateful liquors glide,\n  While China's earth receives the smoking tide.\n  At once they gratify their smell and taste,                     95\n  While frequent cups prolong the rich repast.\n  Coffee (which makes the politician wise,\n  And see through all things with his half-shut eyes)\n  Sent up in vapours to the baron's brain\n  New stratagems, the radiant lock to gain.                      100\n  Ah cease, rash youth! desist ere't is too late,\n  Fear the just gods, and think of Scylla's fate!\n  Changed to a bird, and sent to flit in air,\n  She dearly pays for Nisus' injured hair!\n\n  But when to mischief mortals bend their mind,                  105\n  How soon fit instruments of ill they find!\n  Just then, Clarissa drew with tempting grace\n  A two-edged weapon from her shining case:\n  So ladies, in romance, assist their knight,\n  Present the spear, and arm him for the fight;                  110\n  He takes the gift with rev'rence, and extends\n  The little engine on his fingers' ends;\n  This just behind Belinda's neck he spread,\n  As o'er the fragrant steams she bends her head.\n  He first expands the glitt'ring forfex wide                    115\n  T' enclose the lock; then joins it, to divide;\n  One fatal stroke the sacred hair does sever\n  From the fair head, for ever, and for ever!\n\n  The living fires come flashing from her eyes,\n  And screams of horror rend th' affrighted skies.               120\n  Not louder shrieks by dames to heav'n are cast,\n  When husbands die, or lapdogs breathe their last;\n  Or when rich china vessels, fall'n from high,\n  In glitt'ring dust and painted fragments lie!\n\n  \"Let wreaths of triumph now my temples twine,\"                 125\n  The victor cried, \"the glorious prize is mine!\n  While fish in streams, or birds delight in air,\n  Or in a coach and six the British fair,\n  As long as Atalantis shall be read,\n  Or the small pillow grace a lady's bed,                        130\n  While visits shall be paid on solemn days,\n  When num'rous wax-lights in bright order blaze,\n  While nymphs take treats, or assignations give,\n  So long my honour, name, and praise shall live!\"\n\n  What time would spare, from steel receives its date,           135\n  And monuments, like men, submit to fate!\n  Steel did the labour of the gods destroy,\n  And strike to dust th' aspiring tow'rs of Troy;\n  Steel could the works of mortal pride confound,\n  And hew triumphal arches to the ground.                        140\n  What wonder then, fair nymph! thy hairs should feel\n  The conqu'ring force of unresisted steel?\n\n\n\n\n\nCANTO II\n\n\n  But anxious cares the pensive nymph oppressed,\n  And secret passions laboured in her breast.\n  Not youthful kings in battle seized alive,\n  Not scornful virgins who their charms survive,\n  Not ardent lover robbed of all his bliss,                       5\n  Not ancient lady when refused a kiss,\n  Not tyrants fierce that unrepenting die,\n  Not Cynthia when her manteau's pinned awry,\n  E'er felt such rage, resentment, and despair,\n  As thou, sad virgin! for thy ravished hair.                    10\n\n  While her racked soul repose and peace requires,\n  The fierce Thalestris fans the rising fires.\n  \"O wretched maid!\" she spread her hands, and cried,\n  (And Hampton's echoes, \"Wretched maid!\" replied)\n  \"Was it for this you took such constant care                   15\n  Combs, bodkins, leads, pomatums to prepare?\n  For this your locks in paper durance bound?\n  For this with tort'ring irons wreathed around?\n  Oh had the youth been but content to seize\n  Hairs less in sight, or any hairs but these!                   20\n  Gods! shall the ravisher display this hair,\n  While the fops envy, and the ladies stare!\n  Honour forbid! at whose unrivalled shrine\n  Ease, pleasure, virtue, all, our sex resign.\n  Methinks already I your tears survey,                          25\n  Already hear the horrid things they say,\n  Already see you a degraded toast,\n  And all your honour in a whisper lost!\n  How shall I, then, your helpless fame defend?\n  'T will then be infamy to seem your friend!                    30\n  And shall this prize, th' inestimable prize,\n  Exposed through crystal to the gazing eyes,\n  And heightened by the diamond's circling rays,\n  On that rapacious hand for ever blaze?\n  Sooner shall grass in Hyde Park Circus grow,                   35\n  And wits take lodgings in the sound of Bow;\n  Sooner let earth, air, sea, to chaos fall,\n  Men, monkeys, lapdogs, parrots, perish all!\"\n\n  She said; then raging to Sir Plume repairs,\n  And bids her beau demand the precious hairs:                   40\n  Sir Plume, of amber snuff-box justly vain,\n  And the nice conduct of a clouded cane,\n  With earnest eyes, and round unthinking face,\n  He first the snuff-box opened, then the case,\n  And thus broke out--\"My lord, why, what the devil!             45\n  Zounds! damn the lock! 'fore Gad, you must be civil!\n  Plague on't! 't is past a jest--nay, prithee, pox!\n  Give her the hair.\"--He spoke, and rapped his box.\n\n  \"It grieves me much,\" replied the peer again,\n  \"Who speaks so well should ever speak in vain:                 50\n  But by this lock, this sacred lock, I swear,\n  (Which never more shall join its parted hair;\n  Which never more its honours shall renew,\n  Clipped from the lovely head where once it grew)\n  That, while my nostrils draw the vital air,                    55\n  This hand, which won it, shall for ever wear.\"\n  He spoke, and speaking, in proud triumph spread\n  The long-contended honours of her head.\n\n  But see! the nymph in sorrow's pomp appears,\n  Her eyes half-languishing, half drowned in tears;              60\n  Now livid pale her cheeks, now glowing red\n  On her heaved bosom hung her drooping head,\n  Which with a sigh she raised, and thus she said:\n  \"For ever cursed be this detested day,\n  Which snatched my best, my fav'rite curl away;                 65\n  Happy! ah ten times happy had I been,\n  If Hampton Court these eyes had never seen!\n  Yet am not I the first mistaken maid,\n  By love of courts to num'rous ills betrayed.\n  O had I rather unadmired remained                              70\n  In some lone isle, or distant northern land,\n  Where the gilt chariot never marked the way,\n  Where none learn ombre, none e'er taste bohea!\n  There kept my charms concealed from mortal eye,\n  Like roses, that in deserts bloom and die.                     75\n  What moved my mind with youthful lords to roam?\n  O had I stayed, and said my pray'rs at home!\n  'Twas this the morning omens did foretell,\n  Thrice from my trembling hand the patchbox fell;\n  The tott'ring china shook without a wind,                      80\n  Nay, Poll sat mute, and Shock was most unkind!\n  See the poor remnants of this slighted hair!\n  My hands shall rend what ev'n thy own did spare:\n  This in two sable ringlets taught to break,\n  Once gave new beauties to the snowy neck;                      85\n  The sister-lock now sits uncouth, alone,\n  And in its fellow's fate foresees its own;\n  Uncurled it hangs, the fatal shears demands,\n  And tempts once more thy sacrilegious hands.\"\n\n  She said: the pitying audience melt in tears;                  90\n  But fate and Jove had stopped the baron's ears.\n  In vain Thalestris with reproach assails,\n  For who can move when fair Belinda fails?\n  Not half so fixed the Trojan could remain,\n  While Anna begged and Dido raged in vain.                      95\n  \"To arms, to arms!\" the bold Thalestris cries,\n  And swift as lightning to the combat flies.\n  All side in parties, and begin th' attack;\n  Fans clap, silks rustle, and tough whalebones crack;\n  Heroes' and heroines' shouts confus'dly rise,                 100\n  And bass and treble voices strike the skies;\n  No common weapons in their hands are found,\n  Like gods they fight, nor dread a mortal wound.\n\n  So when bold Homer makes the gods engage,\n  And heav'nly breasts with human passions rage,                105\n  'Gainst Pallas, Mars; Latona, Hermes arms,\n  And all Olympus rings with loud alarms;\n  Jove's thunder roars, heav'n trembles all around,\n  Blue Neptune storms, the bellowing deeps resound:\n  Earth shakes her nodding tow'rs, the ground gives way,        110\n  And the pale ghosts start at the flash of day!\n\n  While through the press enraged Thalestris flies,\n  And scatters death around from both her eyes,\n  A beau and witling perished in the throng,\n  One died in metaphor, and one in song.                        115\n  \"O cruel nymph; a living death I bear,\"\n  Cried Dapperwit, and sunk beside his chair.\n  A mournful glance Sir Fopling upwards cast,\n  \"Those eyes are made so killing\"--was his last.\n  Thus on M\u00c3\u00a6ander's flow'ry margin lies                         120\n  Th' expiring swan, and as he sings he dies.\n\n  As bold Sir Plume had drawn Clarissa down,\n  Chloe stepped in, and killed him with a frown;\n  She smiled to see the doughty hero slain,\n  But at her smile the beau revived again.                      125\n\n  Now Jove suspends his golden scales in air,\n  Weighs the men's wits against the lady's hair;\n  The doubtful beam long nods from side to side;\n  At length the wits mount up, the hairs subside.\n\n  See fierce Belinda on the baron flies,                        130\n  With more than usual lightning in her eyes:\n  Nor feared the chief th' unequal fight to try,\n  Who sought no more than on his foe to die.\n  But this bold lord, with manly strength endued,\n  She with one finger and a thumb subdued:                      135\n  Just where the breath of life his nostrils drew,\n  A charge of snuff the wily virgin threw;\n  Sudden, with starting tears each eye o'erflows,\n  And the high dome re-echoes to his nose.\n\n  \"Now meet thy fate,\" th' incensed virago cried,               140\n  And drew a deadly bodkin from her side.\n\n  \"Boast not my fall,\" he said, \"insulting foe!\n  Thou by some other shalt be laid as low;\n  Nor think to die dejects my lofty mind;\n  All that I dread is leaving you behind!                       145\n  Rather than so, ah let me still survive,\n  And still burn on, in Cupid's flames, alive.\"\n\n  \"Restore the lock!\" she cries; and all around\n  \"Restore the lock!\" the vaulted roofs rebound.\n  Not fierce Othello in so loud a strain                        150\n  Roared for the handkerchief that caused his pain.\n  But see how oft ambitious aims are crossed,\n  And chiefs contend till all the prize is lost!\n  The lock, obtained with guilt, and kept with pain,\n  In ev'ry place is sought, but sought in vain:                 155\n  With such a prize no mortal must be blessed,\n  So heav'n decrees! with heav'n who can contest?\n  Some thought it mounted to the lunar sphere,\n  Since all that man e'er lost is treasured there.\n  There heroes' wits are kept in pond'rous vases,               160\n  And beaux' in snuff-boxes and tweezer-cases.\n  There broken vows, and death-bed alms are found,\n  And lovers' hearts with ends of ribbon bound,\n  The courtier's promises, and sick man's pray'rs,\n  The smiles of harlots, and the tears of heirs,                165\n  Cages for gnats, and chains to yoke a flea,\n  Dried butterflies, and tomes of casuistry.\n\n  But trust the muse--she saw it upward rise,\n  Though marked by none but quick poetic eyes:\n  (Thus Rome's great founder to the heav'ns withdrew,           170\n  To Proculus alone confessed in view)\n  A sudden star, it shot through liquid air,\n  And drew behind a radiant trail of hair.\n  Not Berenice's locks first rose so bright,\n  The skies bespangling with dishevelled light.                 175\n  This the beau monde shall from the Mall survey,    }\n  As through the moonlight shade they nightly stray, }\n  And hail with music its propitious ray;            }\n  This Partridge soon shall view in cloudless skies,\n  When next he looks through Galileo's eyes;                    180\n  And hence th' egregious wizard shall foredoom\n  The fate of Louis, and the fall of Rome.\n\n  Then cease, bright nymph! to mourn thy ravished hair,\n  Which adds new glory to the shining sphere!\n  Not all the tresses that fair head can boast,                 185\n  Shall draw such envy as the lock you lost.\n  For after all the murders of your eye,\n  When, after millions slain, yourself shall die;\n  When those fair suns shall set, as set they must,\n  And all those tresses shall be laid in dust,                  190\n  This lock the muse shall consecrate to fame,\n  And 'midst the stars inscribe Belinda's name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Rape of the Lock and Other Poems, by \nAlexander Pope\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK RAPE OF LOCK AND OTHER POEMS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 9800-8.txt or 9800-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/9\/8\/0\/9800\/\n\nProduced by Clytie Siddall, Charles Aldarondo, Tiffany\nVergon and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":514,"split":"train"}
