Their eyes glanced level, and were fastened upon the waves that swept toward them. These waves were of the hue of slate, save for the tops, which were of foaming white, and all of the men knew the colors of the sea. The horizon narrowed and widened, and dipped and rose, and at all times its edge was jagged with waves that seemed thrust up in points like rocks.\n\"The Open Boat\" is divided into seven sections, each told mainly from the point of view of the correspondent, based upon Crane himself. The first part introduces the four characters\u00e2\u0080\u0094the correspondent, a condescending observer detached from the rest of the group; the captain, who is injured and morose at having lost his ship, yet capable of leadership; the cook, fat and comical, but optimistic that they will be rescued; and the oiler, Billie, who is physically the strongest, and the only one in the story referred to by name. The four are survivors of a shipwreck, which occurred before the beginning of the story, and are drifting at sea in a small dinghy.\nIn the following four sections, the moods of the men fluctuate from anger at their desperate situation, to a growing empathy for one another and the sudden realization that nature is indifferent to their fates. The men become fatigued and bicker with one another; nevertheless, the oiler and the correspondent take turns rowing toward shore, while the cook bails water to keep the boat afloat. When they see a lighthouse on the horizon, their hope is tempered with the realization of the danger of trying to reach it. Their hopes dwindle further when, after seeing a man waving from shore, and what may or may not be another boat, they fail to make contact. The correspondent and the oiler continue to take turns rowing, while the others sleep fitfully during the night. The correspondent then notices a shark swimming near the boat, but he does not seem to be bothered by it as one would expect. In the penultimate chapter, the correspondent wearily recalls a verse from the poem \"Bingen on the Rhine\" by Caroline Norton, in which a \"soldier of the Legion\" dies far from home.\nThe final chapter begins with the men's resolution to abandon the floundering dinghy they have occupied for thirty hours and to swim ashore. As they begin the long swim to the beach, Billie the oiler, the strongest of the four, swims ahead of the others; the captain advances towards the shore while still holding onto the boat, and the cook uses a surviving oar. The correspondent is trapped by a local current, but is eventually able to swim on. After three of the men safely reach the shore and are met by a group of rescuers, they find Billie dead, his body washed up on the beach.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Open Boat and Other Stories, by Stephen\nCrane\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

Their eyes glanced level, and\nwere fastened upon the waves that swept toward them. These waves were\nof the hue of slate, save for the tops, which were of foaming white,\nand all of the men knew the colours of the sea. The horizon narrowed\nand widened, and dipped and rose, and at all times its edge was jagged\nwith waves that seemed thrust up in points like rocks.\n\nMany a man ought to have a bath-tub larger than the boat which here\nrode upon the sea. These waves were most wrongfully and barbarously\nabrupt and tall, and each froth-top was a problem in small boat\nnavigation.\n\nThe cook squatted in the bottom and looked with both eyes at the six\ninches of gunwale which separated him from the ocean. His sleeves were\nrolled over his fat forearms, and the two flaps of his unbuttoned vest\ndangled as he bent to bail out the boat. Often he said: \"Gawd! That was\na narrow clip.\" As he remarked it he invariably gazed eastward over the\nbroken sea.\n\nThe oiler, steering with one of the two oars in the boat, sometimes\nraised himself suddenly to keep clear of water that swirled in over the\nstern. It was a thin little oar and it seemed often ready to snap.\n\nThe correspondent, pulling at the other oar, watched the waves and\nwondered why he was there.\n\nThe injured captain, lying in the bow, was at this time buried in that\nprofound dejection and indifference which comes, temporarily at least,\nto even the bravest and most enduring when, willy nilly, the firm\nfails, the army loses, the ship goes down. The mind of the master of a\nvessel is rooted deep in the timbers of her, though he commanded for a\nday or a decade, and this captain had on him the stern impression of\na scene in the greys of dawn of seven turned faces, and later a stump\nof a top-mast with a white ball on it that slashed to and fro at the\nwaves, went low and lower, and down. Thereafter there was something\nstrange in his voice. Although steady, it was deep with mourning, and\nof a quality beyond oration or tears.\n\n\"Keep 'er a little more south, Billie,\" said he.\n\n\"'A little more south,' sir,\" said the oiler in the stern.\n\nA seat in this boat was not unlike a seat upon a bucking broncho, and,\nby the same token, a broncho is not much smaller. The craft pranced\nand reared, and plunged like an animal. As each wave came, and she\nrose for it, she seemed like a horse making at a fence outrageously\nhigh. The manner of her scramble over these walls of water is a mystic\nthing, and, moreover, at the top of them were ordinarily these problems\nin white water, the foam racing down from the summit of each wave,\nrequiring a new leap, and a leap from the air. Then, after scornfully\nbumping a crest, she would slide, and race, and splash down a long\nincline, and arrive bobbing and nodding in front of the next menace.\n\nA singular disadvantage of the sea lies in the fact that after\nsuccessfully surmounting one wave you discover that there is another\nbehind it just as important and just as nervously anxious to do\nsomething effective in the way of swamping boats. In a ten-foot dingey\none can get an idea of the resources of the sea in the line of waves\nthat is not probable to the average experience which is never at sea in\na dingey. As each slaty wall of water approached, it shut all else from\nthe view of the men in the boat, and it was not difficult to imagine\nthat this particular wave was the final outburst of the ocean, the last\neffort of the grim water. There was a terrible grace in the move of the\nwaves, and they came in silence, save for the snarling of the crests.\n\nIn the wan light, the faces of the men must have been grey. Their eyes\nmust have glinted in strange ways as they gazed steadily astern. Viewed\nfrom a balcony, the whole thing would doubtlessly have been weirdly\npicturesque. But the men in the boat had no time to see it, and if they\nhad had leisure there were other things to occupy their minds. The sun\nswung steadily up the sky, and they knew it was broad day because the\ncolour of the sea changed from slate to emerald-green, streaked with\namber lights, and the foam was like tumbling snow. The process of the\nbreaking day was unknown to them. They were aware only of this effect\nupon the colour of the waves that rolled toward them.\n\nIn disjointed sentences the cook and the correspondent argued as to the\ndifference between a life-saving station and a house of refuge. The\ncook had said: \"There's a house of refuge just north of the Mosquito\nInlet Light, and as soon as they see us, they'll come off in their boat\nand pick us up.\"\n\n\"As soon as who see us?\" said the correspondent.\n\n\"The crew,\" said the cook.\n\n\"Houses of refuge don't have crews,\" said the correspondent. \"As I\nunderstand them, they are only places where clothes and grub are stored\nfor the benefit of shipwrecked people. They don't carry crews.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, they do,\" said the cook.\n\n\"No, they don't,\" said the correspondent.\n\n\"Well, we're not there yet, anyhow,\" said the oiler, in the stern.\n\n\"Well,\" said the cook, \"perhaps it's not a house of refuge that\nI'm thinking of as being near Mosquito Inlet Light. Perhaps it's a\nlife-saving station.\"\n\n\"We're not there yet,\" said the oiler, in the stern.\n\n\n                   II\n\nAs the boat bounced from the top of each wave, the wind tore through\nthe hair of the hatless men, and as the craft plopped her stern down\nagain the spray slashed past them. The crest of each of these waves was\na hill, from the top of which the men surveyed, for a moment, a broad\ntumultuous expanse, shining and wind-riven. It was probably splendid.\nIt was probably glorious, this play of the free sea, wild with lights\nof emerald and white and amber.\n\n\"Bully good thing it's an on-shore wind,\" said the cook. \"If not, where\nwould we be? Wouldn't have a show.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" said the correspondent.\n\nThe busy oiler nodded his assent.\n\nThen the captain, in the bow, chuckled in a way that expressed humour,\ncontempt, tragedy, all in one. \"Do you think we've got much of a show\nnow, boys?\" said he.\n\nWhereupon the three were silent, save for a trifle of hemming and\nhawing. To express any particular optimism at this time they felt to be\nchildish and stupid, but they all doubtless possessed this sense of the\nsituation in their mind. A young man thinks doggedly at such times. On\nthe other hand, the ethics of their condition was decidedly against any\nopen suggestion of hopelessness. So they were silent.\n\n\"Oh, well,\" said the captain, soothing his children, \"we'll get ashore\nall right.\"\n\nBut there was that in his tone which made them think, so the oiler\nquoth: \"Yes! If this wind holds!\"\n\nThe cook was bailing: \"Yes! If we don't catch hell in the surf.\"\n\nCanton flannel gulls flew near and far. Sometimes they sat down on the\nsea, near patches of brown sea-weed that rolled over the waves with a\nmovement like carpets on a line in a gale. The birds sat comfortably in\ngroups, and they were envied by some in the dingey, for the wrath of\nthe sea was no more to them than it was to a covey of prairie chickens\na thousand miles inland. Often they came very close and stared at the\nmen with black bead-like eyes. At these times they were uncanny and\nsinister in their unblinking scrutiny, and the men hooted angrily at\nthem, telling them to be gone. One came, and evidently decided to\nalight on the top of the captain's head. The bird flew parallel to\nthe boat and did not circle, but made short sidelong jumps in the\nair in chicken-fashion. His black eyes were wistfully fixed upon the\ncaptain's head. \"Ugly brute,\" said the oiler to the bird. \"You look as\nif you were made with a jack-knife.\" The cook and the correspondent\nswore darkly at the creature. The captain naturally wished to knock\nit away with the end of the heavy painter; but he did not dare do it,\nbecause anything resembling an emphatic gesture would have capsized\nthis freighted boat, and so with his open hand, the captain gently and\ncarefully waved the gull away. After it had been discouraged from the\npursuit the captain breathed easier on account of his hair, and others\nbreathed easier because the bird struck their minds at this time as\nbeing somehow grewsome and ominous.\n\nIn the meantime the oiler and the correspondent rowed. And also they\nrowed.\n\nThey sat together in the same seat, and each rowed an oar. Then the\noiler took both oars; then the correspondent took both oars; then the\noiler; then the correspondent. They rowed and they rowed. The very\nticklish part of the business was when the time came for the reclining\none in the stern to take his turn at the oars. By the very last star\nof truth, it is easier to steal eggs from under a hen than it was to\nchange seats in the dingey. First the man in the stern slid his hand\nalong the thwart and moved with care, as if he were of S\u00c3\u00a8vres. Then the\nman in the rowing seat slid his hand along the other thwart. It was\nall done with the most extraordinary care. As the two sidled past each\nother, the whole party kept watchful eyes on the coming wave, and the\ncaptain cried: \"Look out now! Steady there!\"\n\nThe brown mats of sea-weed that appeared from time to time were like\nislands, bits of earth. They were travelling, apparently, neither one\nway nor the other. They were, to all intents, stationary. They informed\nthe men in the boat that it was making progress slowly toward the land.\n\nThe captain, rearing cautiously in the bow, after the dingey soared on\na great swell, said that he had seen the lighthouse at Mosquito Inlet.\nPresently the cook remarked that he had seen it. The correspondent was\nat the oars then, and for some reason he too wished to look at the\nlighthouse, but his back was toward the far shore and the waves were\nimportant, and for some time he could not seize an opportunity to turn\nhis head. But at last there came a wave more gentle than the others,\nand when at the crest of it he swiftly scoured the western horizon.\n\n\"See it?\" said the captain.\n\n\"No,\" said the correspondent slowly, \"I didn't see anything.\"\n\n\"Look again,\" said the captain. He pointed. \"It's exactly in that\ndirection.\"\n\nAt the top of another wave, the correspondent did as he was bid, and\nthis time his eyes chanced on a small still thing on the edge of the\nswaying horizon. It was precisely like the point of a pin. It took an\nanxious eye to find a lighthouse so tiny.\n\n\"Think we'll make it, captain?\"\n\n\"If this wind holds and the boat don't swamp, we can't do much else,\"\nsaid the captain.\n\nThe little boat, lifted by each towering sea, and splashed viciously\nby the crests, made progress that in the absence of sea-weed was not\napparent to those in her. She seemed just a wee thing wallowing,\nmiraculously top-up, at the mercy of five oceans. Occasionally, a great\nspread of water, like white flames, swarmed into her.\n\n\"Bail her, cook,\" said the captain serenely.\n\n\"All right, captain,\" said the cheerful cook.\n\n\n                   III\n\nIt would be difficult to describe the subtle brotherhood of men that\nwas here established on the seas. No one said that it was so. No one\nmentioned it. But it dwelt in the boat, and each man felt it warm him.\nThey were a captain, an oiler, a cook, and a correspondent, and they\nwere friends, friends in a more curiously iron-bound degree than may\nbe common. The hurt captain, lying against the water-jar in the bow,\nspoke always in a low voice and calmly, but he could never command\na more ready and swiftly obedient crew than the motley three of the\ndingey. It was more than a mere recognition of what was best for the\ncommon safety. There was surely in it a quality that was personal\nand heartfelt. And after this devotion to the commander of the boat\nthere was this comradeship that the correspondent, for instance, who\nhad been taught to be cynical of men, knew even at the time was the\nbest experience of his life. But no one said that it was so. No one\nmentioned it.\n\n\"I wish we had a sail,\" remarked the captain. \"We might try my overcoat\non the end of an oar and give you two boys a chance to rest.\" So the\ncook and the correspondent held the mast and spread wide the overcoat.\nThe oiler steered, and the little boat made good way with her new rig.\nSometimes the oiler had to scull sharply to keep a sea from breaking\ninto the boat, but otherwise sailing was a success.\n\nMeanwhile the lighthouse had been growing slowly larger. It had now\nalmost assumed colour, and appeared like a little grey shadow on the\nsky. The man at the oars could not be prevented from turning his head\nrather often to try for a glimpse of this little grey shadow.\n\nAt last, from the top of each wave the men in the tossing boat could\nsee land. Even as the lighthouse was an upright shadow on the sky,\nthis land seemed but a long black shadow on the sea. It certainly was\nthinner than paper. \"We must be about opposite New Smyrna,\" said the\ncook, who had coasted this shore often in schooners. \"Captain, by the\nway, I believe they abandoned that life-saving station there about a\nyear ago.\"\n\n\"Did they?\" said the captain.\n\nThe wind slowly died away. The cook and the correspondent were not now\nobliged to slave in order to hold high the oar. But the waves continued\ntheir old impetuous swooping at the dingey, and the little craft,\nno longer under way, struggled woundily over them. The oiler or the\ncorrespondent took the oars again.\n\nShipwrecks are _\u00c3\u00a0 propos_ of nothing. If men could only train for them\nand have them occur when the men had reached pink condition, there\nwould be less drowning at sea. Of the four in the dingey none had slept\nany time worth mentioning for two days and two nights previous to\nembarking in the dingey, and in the excitement of clambering about the\ndeck of a foundering ship they had also forgotten to eat heartily.\n\nFor these reasons, and for others, neither the oiler nor the\ncorrespondent was fond of rowing at this time. The correspondent\nwondered ingenuously how in the name of all that was sane could\nthere be people who thought it amusing to row a boat. It was not an\namusement; it was a diabolical punishment, and even a genius of mental\naberrations could never conclude that it was anything but a horror to\nthe muscles and a crime against the back. He mentioned to the boat in\ngeneral how the amusement of rowing struck him, and the weary-faced\noiler smiled in full sympathy. Previously to the foundering, by the\nway, the oiler had worked double-watch in the engine-room of the ship.\n\n\"Take her easy, now, boys,\" said the captain. \"Don't spend yourselves.\nIf we have to run a surf you'll need all your strength, because we'll\nsure have to swim for it. Take your time.\"\n\nSlowly the land arose from the sea. From a black line it became a line\nof black and a line of white, trees and sand. Finally, the captain\nsaid that he could make out a house on the shore. \"That's the house of\nrefuge, sure,\" said the cook. \"They'll see us before long, and come out\nafter us.\"\n\nThe distant lighthouse reared high. \"The keeper ought to be able to\nmake us out now, if he's looking through a glass,\" said the captain.\n\"He'll notify the life-saving people.\"\n\n\"None of those other boats could have got ashore to give word of the\nwreck,\" said the oiler, in a low voice. \"Else the life-boat would be\nout hunting us.\"\n\nSlowly and beautifully the land loomed out of the sea. The wind came\nagain. It had veered from the north-east to the south-east. Finally,\na new sound struck the ears of the men in the boat. It was the low\nthunder of the surf on the shore. \"We'll never be able to make the\nlighthouse now,\" said the captain. \"Swing her head a little more north,\nBillie,\" said he.\n\n\"'A little more north,' sir,\" said the oiler.\n\nWhereupon the little boat turned her nose once more down the wind, and\nall but the oarsman watched the shore grow. Under the influence of this\nexpansion doubt and direful apprehension was leaving the minds of the\nmen. The management of the boat was still most absorbing, but it could\nnot prevent a quiet cheerfulness. In an hour, perhaps, they would be\nashore.\n\nTheir backbones had become thoroughly used to balancing in the boat,\nand they now rode this wild colt of a dingey like circus men. The\ncorrespondent thought that he had been drenched to the skin, but\nhappening to feel in the top pocket of his coat, he found therein eight\ncigars. Four of them were soaked with sea-water; four were perfectly\nscatheless. After a search, somebody produced three dry matches, and\nthereupon the four waifs rode impudently in their little boat, and with\nan assurance of an impending rescue shining in their eyes, puffed at\nthe big cigars and judged well and ill of all men. Everybody took a\ndrink of water.\n\n\n                   IV\n\n\"Cook,\" remarked the captain, \"there don't seem to be any signs of life\nabout your house of refuge.\"\n\n\"No,\" replied the cook. \"Funny they don't see us!\"\n\nA broad stretch of lowly coast lay before the eyes of the men. It was\nof dunes topped with dark vegetation. The roar of the surf was plain,\nand sometimes they could see the white lip of a wave as it spun up the\nbeach. A tiny house was blocked out black upon the sky. Southward, the\nslim lighthouse lifted its little grey length.\n\nTide, wind, and waves were swinging the dingey northward. \"Funny they\ndon't see us,\" said the men.\n\nThe surf's roar was here dulled, but its tone was, nevertheless,\nthunderous and mighty. As the boat swam over the great rollers, the men\nsat listening to this roar. \"We'll swamp sure,\" said everybody.\n\nIt is fair to say here that there was not a life-saving station within\ntwenty miles in either direction, but the men did not know this fact,\nand in consequence they made dark and opprobrious remarks concerning\nthe eyesight of the nation's life-savers. Four scowling men sat in the\ndingey and surpassed records in the invention of epithets.\n\n\"Funny they don't see us.\"\n\nThe light-heartedness of a former time had completely faded. To their\nsharpened minds it was easy to conjure pictures of all kinds of\nincompetency and blindness and, indeed, cowardice. There was the shore\nof the populous land, and it was bitter and bitter to them that from it\ncame no sign.\n\n\"Well,\" said the captain, ultimately, \"I suppose we'll have to make a\ntry for ourselves. If we stay out here too long, we'll none of us have\nstrength left to swim after the boat swamps.\"\n\nAnd so the oiler, who was at the oars, turned the boat straight for\nthe shore. There was a sudden tightening of muscles. There was some\nthinking.\n\n\"If we don't all get ashore--\" said the captain. \"If we don't all get\nashore, I suppose you fellows know where to send news of my finish?\"\n\nThey then briefly exchanged some addresses and admonitions. As\nfor the reflections of the men, there was a great deal of rage in\nthem. Perchance they might be formulated thus: \"If I am going to be\ndrowned--if I am going to be drowned--if I am going to be drowned, why,\nin the name of the seven mad gods who rule the sea, was I allowed to\ncome thus far and contemplate sand and trees? Was I brought here merely\nto have my nose dragged away as I was about to nibble the sacred cheese\nof life? It is preposterous. If this old ninny-woman, Fate, cannot do\nbetter than this, she should be deprived of the management of men's\nfortunes. She is an old hen who knows not her intention. If she has\ndecided to drown me, why did she not do it in the beginning and save\nme all this trouble? The whole affair is absurd.... But no, she cannot\nmean to drown me. She dare not drown me. She cannot drown me. Not\nafter all this work.\" Afterward the man might have had an impulse to\nshake his fist at the clouds: \"Just you drown me, now, and then hear\nwhat I call you!\"\n\nThe billows that came at this time were more formidable. They seemed\nalways just about to break and roll over the little boat in a turmoil\nof foam. There was a preparatory and long growl in the speech of them.\nNo mind unused to the sea would have concluded that the dingey could\nascend these sheer heights in time. The shore was still afar. The oiler\nwas a wily surfman. \"Boys,\" he said swiftly, \"she won't live three\nminutes more, and we're too far out to swim. Shall I take her to sea\nagain, captain?\"\n\n\"Yes! Go ahead!\" said the captain.\n\nThis oiler, by a series of quick miracles, and fast and steady\noarsmanship, turned the boat in the middle of the surf and took her\nsafely to sea again.\n\nThere was a considerable silence as the boat bumped over the furrowed\nsea to deeper water. Then somebody in gloom spoke. \"Well, anyhow, they\nmust have seen us from the shore by now.\"\n\nThe gulls went in slanting flight up the wind toward the grey desolate\neast. A squall, marked by dingy clouds, and clouds brick-red, like\nsmoke from a burning building, appeared from the south-east.\n\n\"What do you think of those life-saving people? Ain't they peaches?\"\n\n\"Funny they haven't seen us.\"\n\n\"Maybe they think we're out here for sport! Maybe they think we're\nfishin'. Maybe they think we're damned fools.\"\n\nIt was a long afternoon. A changed tide tried to force them southward,\nbut wind and wave said northward. Far ahead, where coast-line, sea, and\nsky formed their mighty angle, there were little dots which seemed to\nindicate a city on the shore.\n\n\"St. Augustine?\"\n\nThe captain shook his head. \"Too near Mosquito Inlet.\"\n\nAnd the oiler rowed, and then the correspondent rowed. Then the oiler\nrowed. It was a weary business. The human back can become the seat of\nmore aches and pains than are registered in books for the composite\nanatomy of a regiment. It is a limited area, but it can become the\ntheatre of innumerable muscular conflicts, tangles, wrenches, knots,\nand other comforts.\n\n\"Did you ever like to row, Billie?\" asked the correspondent.\n\n\"No,\" said the oiler. \"Hang it.\"\n\nWhen one exchanged the rowing-seat for a place in the bottom of the\nboat, he suffered a bodily depression that caused him to be careless\nof everything save an obligation to wiggle one finger. There was cold\nsea-water swashing to and fro in the boat, and he lay in it. His\nhead, pillowed on a thwart, was within an inch of the swirl of a wave\ncrest, and sometimes a particularly obstreperous sea came in-board\nand drenched him once more. But these matters did not annoy him. It\nis almost certain that if the boat had capsized he would have tumbled\ncomfortably out upon the ocean as if he felt sure that it was a great\nsoft mattress.\n\n\"Look! There's a man on the shore!\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"There! See 'im? See 'im?\"\n\n\"Yes, sure! He's walking along.\"\n\n\"Now he's stopped. Look! He's facing us!\"\n\n\"He's waving at us!\"\n\n\"So he is! By thunder!\"\n\n\"Ah, now we're all right! Now we're all right! There'll be a boat out\nhere for us in half-an-hour.\"\n\n\"He's going on. He's running. He's going up to that house there.\"\n\nThe remote beach seemed lower than the sea, and it required a searching\nglance to discern the little black figure. The captain saw a floating\nstick and they rowed to it. A bath-towel was by some weird chance in\nthe boat, and, tying this on the stick, the captain waved it. The\noarsman did not dare turn his head, so he was obliged to ask questions.\n\n\"What's he doing now?\"\n\n\"He's standing still again. He's looking, I think.... There he goes\nagain. Towards the house.... Now he's stopped again.\"\n\n\"Is he waving at us?\"\n\n\"No, not now! he was, though.\"\n\n\"Look! There comes another man!\"\n\n\"He's running.\"\n\n\"Look at him go, would you.\"\n\n\"Why, he's on a bicycle. Now he's met the other man. They're both\nwaving at us. Look!\"\n\n\"There comes something up the beach.\"\n\n\"What the devil is that thing?\"\n\n\"Why, it looks like a boat.\"\n\n\"Why, certainly it's a boat.\"\n\n\"No, it's on wheels.\"\n\n\"Yes, so it is. Well, that must be the life-boat. They drag them along\nshore on a wagon.\"\n\n\"That's the life-boat, sure.\"\n\n\"No, by ----, it's--it's an omnibus.\"\n\n\"I tell you it's a life-boat.\"\n\n\"It is not! It's an omnibus. I can see it plain. See? One of these big\nhotel omnibuses.\"\n\n\"By thunder, you're right. It's an omnibus, sure as fate. What do you\nsuppose they are doing with an omnibus? Maybe they are going around\ncollecting the life-crew, hey?\"\n\n\"That's it, likely. Look! There's a fellow waving a little black flag.\nHe's standing on the steps of the omnibus. There come those other two\nfellows. Now they're all talking together. Look at the fellow with the\nflag. Maybe he ain't waving it.\"\n\n\"That ain't a flag, is it? That's his coat. Why certainly, that's his\ncoat.\"\n\n\"So it is. It's his coat. He's taken it off and is waving it around his\nhead. But would you look at him swing it.\"\n\n\"Oh, say, there isn't any life-saving station there. That's just a\nwinter resort hotel omnibus that has brought over some of the boarders\nto see us drown.\"\n\n\"What's that idiot with the coat mean? What's he signaling, anyhow?\"\n\n\"It looks as if he were trying to tell us to go north. There must be a\nlife-saving station up there.\"\n\n\"No! He thinks we're fishing. Just giving us a merry hand. See? Ah,\nthere, Willie.\"\n\n\"Well, I wish I could make something out of those signals. What do you\nsuppose he means?\"\n\n\"He don't mean anything. He's just playing.\"\n\n\"Well, if he'd just signal us to try the surf again, or to go to sea\nand wait, or go north, or go south, or go to hell--there would be some\nreason in it. But look at him. He just stands there and keeps his coat\nrevolving like a wheel. The ass!\"\n\n\"There come more people.\"\n\n\"Now there's quite a mob. Look! Isn't that a boat?\"\n\n\"Where? Oh, I see where you mean. No, that's no boat.\"\n\n\"That fellow is still waving his coat.\"\n\n\"He must think we like to see him do that. Why don't he quit it? It\ndon't mean anything.\"\n\n\"I don't know. I think he is trying to make us go north. It must be\nthat there's a life-saving station there somewhere.\"\n\n\"Say, he ain't tired yet. Look at 'im wave.\"\n\n\"Wonder how long he can keep that up. He's been revolving his coat ever\nsince he caught sight of us. He's an idiot. Why aren't they getting men\nto bring a boat out? A fishing boat--one of those big yawls--could come\nout here all right. Why don't he do something?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's all right, now.\"\n\n\"They'll have a boat out here for us in less than no time, now that\nthey've seen us.\"\n\nA faint yellow tone came into the sky over the low land. The shadows on\nthe sea slowly deepened. The wind bore coldness with it, and the men\nbegan to shiver.\n\n\"Holy smoke!\" said one, allowing his voice to express his impious mood,\n\"if we keep on monkeying out here! If we've got to flounder out here\nall night!\"\n\n\"Oh, we'll never have to stay here all night! Don't you worry. They've\nseen us now, and it won't be long before they'll come chasing out after\nus.\"\n\nThe shore grew dusky. The man waving a coat blended gradually into this\ngloom, and it swallowed in the same manner the omnibus and the group of\npeople. The spray, when it dashed uproariously over the side, made the\nvoyagers shrink and swear like men who were being branded.\n\n\"I'd like to catch the chump who waved the coat. I feel like soaking\nhim one, just for luck.\"\n\n\"Why? What did he do?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing, but then he seemed so damned cheerful.\"\n\nIn the meantime the oiler rowed, and then the correspondent rowed, and\nthen the oiler rowed. Grey-faced and bowed forward, they mechanically,\nturn by turn, plied the leaden oars. The form of the lighthouse had\nvanished from the southern horizon, but finally a pale star appeared,\njust lifting from the sea. The streaked saffron in the west passed\nbefore the all-merging darkness, and the sea to the east was black. The\nland had vanished, and was expressed only by the low and drear thunder\nof the surf.\n\n\"If I am going to be drowned--if I am going to be drowned--if I am\ngoing to be drowned, why, in the name of the seven mad gods who rule\nthe sea, was I allowed to come thus far and contemplate sand and\ntrees? Was I brought here merely to have my nose dragged away as I was\nabout to nibble the sacred cheese of life?\"\n\nThe patient captain, drooped over the water-jar, was sometimes obliged\nto speak to the oarsman.\n\n\"Keep her head up! Keep her head up!\"\n\n\"'Keep her head up,' sir.\" The voices were weary and low.\n\nThis was surely a quiet evening. All save the oarsman lay heavily and\nlistlessly in the boat's bottom. As for him, his eyes were just capable\nof noting the tall black waves that swept forward in a most sinister\nsilence, save for an occasional subdued growl of a crest.\n\nThe cook's head was on a thwart, and he looked without interest at the\nwater under his nose. He was deep in other scenes. Finally he spoke.\n\"Billie,\" he murmured, dreamfully, \"what kind of pie do you like best?\"\n\n\n                   V\n\n\"Pie,\" said the oiler and the correspondent, agitatedly. \"Don't talk\nabout those things, blast you!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the cook, \"I was just thinking about ham sandwiches,\nand----\"\n\nA night on the sea in an open boat is a long night. As darkness settled\nfinally, the shine of the light, lifting from the sea in the south,\nchanged to full gold. On the northern horizon a new light appeared, a\nsmall bluish gleam on the edge of the waters. These two lights were the\nfurniture of the world. Otherwise there was nothing but waves.\n\nTwo men huddled in the stern, and distances were so magnificent in\nthe dingey that the rower was enabled to keep his feet partly warmed\nby thrusting them under his companions. Their legs indeed extended\nfar under the rowing-seat until they touched the feet of the captain\nforward. Sometimes, despite the efforts of the tired oarsman, a wave\ncame piling into the boat, an icy wave of the night, and the chilling\nwater soaked them anew. They would twist their bodies for a moment and\ngroan, and sleep the dead sleep once more, while the water in the boat\ngurgled about them as the craft rocked.\n\nThe plan of the oiler and the correspondent was for one to row until he\nlost the ability, and then arouse the other from his sea-water couch in\nthe bottom of the boat.\n\nThe oiler plied the oars until his head drooped forward, and the\noverpowering sleep blinded him. And he rowed yet afterward. Then he\ntouched a man in the bottom of the boat, and called his name. \"Will you\nspell me for a little while?\" he said, meekly.\n\n\"Sure, Billie,\" said the correspondent, awakening and dragging himself\nto a sitting position. They exchanged places carefully, and the oiler,\ncuddling down in the sea-water at the cook's side, seemed to go to\nsleep instantly.\n\nThe particular violence of the sea had ceased. The waves came without\nsnarling. The obligation of the man at the oars was to keep the boat\nheaded so that the tilt of the rollers would not capsize her, and to\npreserve her from filling when the crests rushed past. The black waves\nwere silent and hard to be seen in the darkness. Often one was almost\nupon the boat before the oarsman was aware.\n\nIn a low voice the correspondent addressed the captain. He was not sure\nthat the captain was awake, although this iron man seemed to be always\nawake. \"Captain, shall I keep her making for that light north, sir?\"\n\nThe same steady voice answered him. \"Yes. Keep it about two points off\nthe port bow.\"\n\nThe cook had tied a life-belt around himself in order to get even the\nwarmth which this clumsy cork contrivance could donate, and he seemed\nalmost stove-like when a rower, whose teeth invariably chattered wildly\nas soon as he ceased his labour, dropped down to sleep.\n\nThe correspondent, as he rowed, looked down at the two men sleeping\nunder-foot. The cook's arm was around the oiler's shoulders, and, with\ntheir fragmentary clothing and haggard faces, they were the babes of\nthe sea, a grotesque rendering of the old babes in the wood.\n\nLater he must have grown stupid at his work, for suddenly there was a\ngrowling of water, and a crest came with a roar and a swash into the\nboat, and it was a wonder that it did not set the cook afloat in his\nlife-belt. The cook continued to sleep, but the oiler sat up, blinking\nhis eyes and shaking with the new cold.\n\n\"Oh, I'm awful sorry, Billie,\" said the correspondent contritely.\n\n\"That's all right, old boy,\" said the oiler, and lay down again and was\nasleep.\n\nPresently it seemed that even the captain dozed, and the correspondent\nthought that he was the one man afloat on all the oceans. The wind had\na voice as it came over the waves, and it was sadder than the end.\n\nThere was a long, loud swishing astern of the boat, and a gleaming\ntrail of phosphorescence, like blue flame, was furrowed on the black\nwaters. It might have been made by a monstrous knife.\n\nThen there came a stillness, while the correspondent breathed with the\nopen mouth and looked at the sea.\n\nSuddenly there was another swish and another long flash of bluish\nlight, and this time it was alongside the boat, and might almost have\nbeen reached with an oar. The correspondent saw an enormous fin speed\nlike a shadow through the water, hurling the crystalline spray and\nleaving the long glowing trail.\n\nThe correspondent looked over his shoulder at the captain. His face was\nhidden, and he seemed to be asleep. He looked at the babes of the sea.\nThey certainly were asleep. So, being bereft of sympathy, he leaned a\nlittle way to one side and swore softly into the sea.\n\nBut the thing did not then leave the vicinity of the boat. Ahead or\nastern, on one side or the other, at intervals long or short, fled the\nlong sparkling streak, and there was to be heard the whiroo of the dark\nfin. The speed and power of the thing was greatly to be admired. It cut\nthe water like a gigantic and keen projectile.\n\nThe presence of this biding thing did not affect the man with the same\nhorror that it would if he had been a picnicker. He simply looked at\nthe sea dully and swore in an undertone.\n\nNevertheless, it is true that he did not wish to be alone. He wished\none of his companions to awaken by chance and keep him company with it.\nBut the captain hung motionless over the water-jar, and the oiler and\nthe cook in the bottom of the boat were plunged in slumber.\n\n\n                   VI\n\n\"If I am going to be drowned--if I am going to be drowned--if I am\ngoing to be drowned, why, in the name of the seven mad gods who rule\nthe sea, was I allowed to come thus far and contemplate sand and trees?\"\n\nDuring this dismal night, it may be remarked that a man would conclude\nthat it was really the intention of the seven mad gods to drown him,\ndespite the abominable injustice of it. For it was certainly an\nabominable injustice to drown a man who had worked so hard, so hard.\nThe man felt it would be a crime most unnatural. Other people had\ndrowned at sea since galleys swarmed with painted sails, but still----\n\nWhen it occurs to a man that nature does not regard him as important,\nand that she feels she would not maim the universe by disposing of\nhim, he at first wishes to throw bricks at the temple, and he hates\ndeeply the fact that there are no bricks and no temples. Any visible\nexpression of nature would surely be pelleted with his jeers.\n\nThen, if there be no tangible thing to hoot he feels, perhaps, the\ndesire to confront a personification and indulge in pleas, bowed to one\nknee, and with hands supplicant, saying: \"Yes, but I love myself.\"\n\nA high cold star on a winter's night is the word he feels that she says\nto him. Thereafter he knows the pathos of his situation.\n\nThe men in the dingey had not discussed these matters, but each had, no\ndoubt, reflected upon them in silence and according to his mind. There\nwas seldom any expression upon their faces save the general one of\ncomplete weariness. Speech was devoted to the business of the boat.\n\nTo chime the notes of his emotion, a verse mysteriously entered the\ncorrespondent's head. He had even forgotten that he had forgotten this\nverse, but it suddenly was in his mind.\n\n    \"A soldier of the Legion lay dying in Algiers,\n    There was lack of woman's nursing, there was dearth of woman's tears;\n    But a comrade stood beside him, and he took that comrade's hand,\n    And he said: 'I shall never see my own, my native land.'\"\n\nIn his childhood, the correspondent had been made acquainted with the\nfact that a soldier of the Legion lay dying in Algiers, but he had\nnever regarded the fact as important. Myriads of his school-fellows had\ninformed him of the soldier's plight, but the dinning had naturally\nended by making him perfectly indifferent. He had never considered it\nhis affair that a soldier of the Legion lay dying in Algiers, nor had\nit appeared to him as a matter for sorrow. It was less to him than the\nbreaking of a pencil's point.\n\nNow, however, it quaintly came to him as a human, living thing. It was\nno longer merely a picture of a few throes in the breast of a poet,\nmeanwhile drinking tea and warming his feet at the grate; it was an\nactuality--stern, mournful, and fine.\n\nThe correspondent plainly saw the soldier. He lay on the sand with his\nfeet out straight and still. While his pale left hand was upon his\nchest in an attempt to thwart the going of his life, the blood came\nbetween his fingers. In the far Algerian distance, a city of low square\nforms was set against a sky that was faint with the last sunset hues.\nThe correspondent, plying the oars and dreaming of the slow and slower\nmovements of the lips of the soldier, was moved by a profound and\nperfectly impersonal comprehension. He was sorry for the soldier of the\nLegion who lay dying in Algiers.\n\nThe thing which had followed the boat and waited, had evidently grown\nbored at the delay. There was no longer to be heard the slash of the\ncut-water, and there was no longer the flame of the long trail. The\nlight in the north still glimmered, but it was apparently no nearer to\nthe boat. Sometimes the boom of the surf rang in the correspondent's\nears, and he turned the craft seaward then and rowed harder. Southward,\nsome one had evidently built a watch-fire on the beach. It was too low\nand too far to be seen, but it made a shimmering, roseate reflection\nupon the bluff back of it, and this could be discerned from the boat.\nThe wind came stronger, and sometimes a wave suddenly raged out like\na mountain-cat, and there was to be seen the sheen and sparkle of a\nbroken crest.\n\nThe captain, in the bow, moved on his water-jar and sat erect. \"Pretty\nlong night,\" he observed to the correspondent. He looked at the shore.\n\"Those life-saving people take their time.\"\n\n\"Did you see that shark playing around?\"\n\n\"Yes, I saw him. He was a big fellow, all right.\"\n\n\"Wish I had known you were awake.\"\n\nLater the correspondent spoke into the bottom of the boat.\n\n\"Billie!\" There was a slow and gradual disentanglement. \"Billie, will\nyou spell me?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said the oiler.\n\nAs soon as the correspondent touched the cold comfortable sea-water in\nthe bottom of the boat, and had huddled close to the cook's life-belt\nhe was deep in sleep, despite the fact that his teeth played all the\npopular airs. This sleep was so good to him that it was but a moment\nbefore he heard a voice call his name in a tone that demonstrated the\nlast stages of exhaustion. \"Will you spell me?\"\n\n\"Sure, Billie.\"\n\nThe light in the north had mysteriously vanished, but the\ncorrespondent took his course from the wide-awake captain.\n\nLater in the night they took the boat farther out to sea, and the\ncaptain directed the cook to take one oar at the stern and keep the\nboat facing the seas. He was to call out if he should hear the thunder\nof the surf. This plan enabled the oiler and the correspondent to get\nrespite together. \"We'll give those boys a chance to get into shape\nagain,\" said the captain. They curled down and, after a few preliminary\nchatterings and trembles, slept once more the dead sleep. Neither\nknew they had bequeathed to the cook the company of another shark, or\nperhaps the same shark.\n\nAs the boat caroused on the waves, spray occasionally bumped over the\nside and gave them a fresh soaking, but this had no power to break\ntheir repose. The ominous slash of the wind and the water affected them\nas it would have affected mummies.\n\n\"Boys,\" said the cook, with the notes of every reluctance in his voice,\n\"she's drifted in pretty close. I guess one of you had better take\nher to sea again.\" The correspondent, aroused, heard the crash of the\ntoppled crests.\n\nAs he was rowing, the captain gave him some whisky-and-water, and this\nsteadied the chills out of him. \"If I ever get ashore and anybody shows\nme even a photograph of an oar----\"\n\nAt last there was a short conversation.\n\n\"Billie.... Billie, will you spell me?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said the oiler.\n\n\n                   VII\n\nWhen the correspondent again opened his eyes, the sea and the sky\nwere each of the grey hue of the dawning. Later, carmine and gold\nwas painted upon the waters. The morning appeared finally, in its\nsplendour, with a sky of pure blue, and the sunlight flamed on the tips\nof the waves.\n\nOn the distant dunes were set many little black cottages, and a tall\nwhite windmill reared above them. No man, nor dog, nor bicycle appeared\non the beach. The cottages might have formed a deserted village.\n\nThe voyagers scanned the shore. A conference was held in the boat.\n\"Well,\" said the captain, \"if no help is coming we might better try\na run through the surf right away. If we stay out here much longer\nwe will be too weak to do anything for ourselves at all.\" The others\nsilently acquiesced in this reasoning. The boat was headed for the\nbeach. The correspondent wondered if none ever ascended the tall\nwind-tower, and if then they never looked seaward. This tower was a\ngiant, standing with its back to the plight of the ants. It represented\nin a degree, to the correspondent, the serenity of nature amid the\nstruggles of the individual--nature in the wind, and nature in the\nvision of men. She did not seem cruel to him then, nor beneficent, nor\ntreacherous, nor wise. But she was indifferent, flatly indifferent. It\nis, perhaps, plausible that a man in this situation, impressed with\nthe unconcern of the universe, should see the innumerable flaws of his\nlife, and have them taste wickedly in his mind and wish for another\nchance. A distinction between right and wrong seems absurdly clear to\nhim, then, in this new ignorance of the grave-edge, and he understands\nthat if he were given another opportunity he would mend his conduct and\nhis words, and be better and brighter during an introduction or at a\ntea.\n\n\"Now, boys,\" said the captain, \"she is going to swamp, sure. All we can\ndo is to work her in as far as possible, and then when she swamps, pile\nout and scramble for the beach. Keep cool now, and don't jump until she\nswamps sure.\"\n\nThe oiler took the oars. Over his shoulders he scanned the surf.\n\"Captain,\" he said, \"I think I'd better bring her about, and keep her\nhead-on to the seas and back her in.\"\n\n\"All right, Billie,\" said the captain. \"Back her in.\" The oiler swung\nthe boat then and, seated in the stern, the cook and the correspondent\nwere obliged to look over their shoulders to contemplate the lonely and\nindifferent shore.\n\nThe monstrous in-shore rollers heaved the boat high until the men were\nagain enabled to see the white sheets of water scudding up the slanted\nbeach. \"We won't get in very close,\" said the captain. Each time a man\ncould wrest his attention from the rollers, he turned his glance toward\nthe shore, and in the expression of the eyes during this contemplation\nthere was a singular quality. The correspondent, observing the others,\nknew that they were not afraid, but the full meaning of their glances\nwas shrouded.\n\nAs for himself, he was too tired to grapple fundamentally with the\nfact. He tried to coerce his mind into thinking of it, but the mind\nwas dominated at this time by the muscles, and the muscles said they\ndid not care. It merely occurred to him that if he should drown it\nwould be a shame.\n\nThere were no hurried words, no pallor, no plain agitation. The men\nsimply looked at the shore. \"Now, remember to get well clear of the\nboat when you jump,\" said the captain.\n\nSeaward the crest of a roller suddenly fell with a thunderous crash,\nand the long white comber came roaring down upon the boat.\n\n\"Steady now,\" said the captain. The men were silent. They turned their\neyes from the shore to the comber and waited. The boat slid up the\nincline, leaped at the furious top, bounced over it, and swung down the\nlong back of the wave. Some water had been shipped and the cook bailed\nit out.\n\nBut the next crest crashed also. The tumbling boiling flood of white\nwater caught the boat and whirled it almost perpendicular. Water\nswarmed in from all sides. The correspondent had his hands on the\ngunwale at this time, and when the water entered at that place he\nswiftly withdrew his fingers, as if he objected to wetting them.\n\nThe little boat, drunken with this weight of water, reeled and snuggled\ndeeper into the sea.\n\n\"Bail her out, cook! Bail her out,\" said the captain.\n\n\"All right, captain,\" said the cook.\n\n\"Now, boys, the next one will do for us, sure,\" said the oiler. \"Mind\nto jump clear of the boat.\"\n\nThe third wave moved forward, huge, furious, implacable. It fairly\nswallowed the dingey, and almost simultaneously the men tumbled into\nthe sea. A piece of life-belt had lain in the bottom of the boat, and\nas the correspondent went overboard he held this to his chest with his\nleft hand.\n\nThe January water was icy, and he reflected immediately that it was\ncolder than he had expected to find it off the coast of Florida. This\nappeared to his dazed mind as a fact important enough to be noted at\nthe time. The coldness of the water was sad; it was tragic. This fact\nwas somehow so mixed and confused with his opinion of his own situation\nthat it seemed almost a proper reason for tears. The water was cold.\n\nWhen he came to the surface he was conscious of little but the noisy\nwater. Afterward he saw his companions in the sea. The oiler was\nahead in the race. He was swimming strongly and rapidly. Off to the\ncorrespondent's left, the cook's great white and corked back bulged out\nof the water, and in the rear the captain was hanging with his one good\nhand to the keel of the overturned dingey.\n\nThere is a certain immovable quality to a shore, and the correspondent\nwondered at it amid the confusion of the sea.\n\nIt seemed also very attractive, but the correspondent knew that it was\na long journey, and he paddled leisurely. The piece of life-preserver\nlay under him, and sometimes he whirled down the incline of a wave as\nif he were on a hand-sled.\n\nBut finally he arrived at a place in the sea where travel was beset\nwith difficulty. He did not pause swimming to inquire what manner of\ncurrent had caught him, but there his progress ceased. The shore was\nset before him like a bit of scenery on a stage, and he looked at it\nand understood with his eyes each detail of it.\n\nAs the cook passed, much farther to the left, the captain was calling\nto him, \"Turn over on your back, cook! Turn over on your back and use\nthe oar.\"\n\n\"All right, sir.\" The cook turned on his back, and, paddling with an\noar, went ahead as if he were a canoe.\n\nPresently the boat also passed to the left of the correspondent with\nthe captain clinging with one hand to the keel. He would have appeared\nlike a man raising himself to look over a board fence, if it were\nnot for the extraordinary gymnastics of the boat. The correspondent\nmarvelled that the captain could still hold to it.\n\nThey passed on, nearer to shore--the oiler, the cook, the captain--and\nfollowing them went the water-jar, bouncing gaily over the seas.\n\nThe correspondent remained in the grip of this strange new enemy--a\ncurrent. The shore, with its white slope of sand and its green bluff,\ntopped with little silent cottages, was spread like a picture before\nhim. It was very near to him then, but he was impressed as one who in a\ngallery looks at a scene from Brittany or Holland.\n\nHe thought: \"I am going to drown? Can it be possible? Can it be\npossible? Can it be possible?\" Perhaps an individual must consider his\nown death to be the final phenomenon of nature.\n\nBut later a wave perhaps whirled him out of this small deadly current,\nfor he found suddenly that he could again make progress toward the\nshore. Later still, he was aware that the captain, clinging with one\nhand to the keel of the dingey, had his face turned away from the shore\nand toward him, and was calling his name. \"Come to the boat! Come to\nthe boat!\"\n\nIn his struggle to reach the captain and the boat, he reflected that\nwhen one gets properly wearied, drowning must really be a comfortable\narrangement, a cessation of hostilities accompanied by a large degree\nof relief, and he was glad of it, for the main thing in his mind for\nsome moments had been horror of the temporary agony. He did not wish to\nbe hurt.\n\nPresently he saw a man running along the shore. He was undressing with\nmost remarkable speed. Coat, trousers, shirt, everything flew magically\noff him.\n\n\"Come to the boat,\" called the captain.\n\n\"All right, captain.\" As the correspondent paddled, he saw the captain\nlet himself down to bottom and leave the boat. Then the correspondent\nperformed his one little marvel of the voyage. A large wave caught him\nand flung him with ease and supreme speed completely over the boat and\nfar beyond it. It struck him even then as an event in gymnastics, and\na true miracle of the sea. An overturned boat in the surf is not a\nplaything to a swimming man.\n\nThe correspondent arrived in water that reached only to his waist, but\nhis condition did not enable him to stand for more than a moment. Each\nwave knocked him into a heap, and the under-tow pulled at him.\n\nThen he saw the man who had been running and undressing, and undressing\nand running, come bounding into the water. He dragged ashore the cook,\nand then waded towards the captain, but the captain waved him away, and\nsent him to the correspondent. He was naked, naked as a tree in winter,\nbut a halo was about his head, and he shone like a saint. He gave a\nstrong pull, and a long drag, and a bully heave at the correspondent's\nhand. The correspondent, schooled in the minor formul\u00c3\u00a6, said: \"Thanks,\nold man.\" But suddenly the man cried: \"What's that?\" He pointed a swift\nfinger. The correspondent said: \"Go.\"\n\nIn the shallows, face downward, lay the oiler. His forehead touched\nsand that was periodically, between each wave, clear of the sea.\n\nThe correspondent did not know all that transpired afterward. When he\nachieved safe ground he fell, striking the sand with each particular\npart of his body. It was as if he had dropped from a roof, but the thud\nwas grateful to him.\n\nIt seems that instantly the beach was populated with men with blankets,\nclothes, and flasks, and women with coffee-pots and all the remedies\nsacred to their minds. The welcome of the land to the men from the sea\nwas warm and generous, but a still and dripping shape was carried\nslowly up the beach, and the land's welcome for it could only be the\ndifferent and sinister hospitality of the grave.\n\nWhen it came night, the white waves paced to and fro in the moonlight,\nand the wind brought the sound of the great sea's voice to the men on\nshore, and they felt that they could then be interpreters.\n\n\n\n\n          A MAN AND SOME OTHERS\n\n\n                   I\n\nDark mesquit spread from horizon to horizon. There was no house or\nhorseman from which a mind could evolve a city or a crowd. The world\nwas declared to be a desert and unpeopled. Sometimes, however, on\ndays when no heat-mist arose, a blue shape, dim, of the substance\nof a spectre's veil, appeared in the south-west, and a pondering\nsheep-herder might remember that there were mountains.\n\nIn the silence of these plains the sudden and childish banging of a\ntin pan could have made an iron-nerved man leap into the air. The sky\nwas ever flawless; the manoeuvring of clouds was an unknown pageant;\nbut at times a sheep-herder could see, miles away, the long, white\nstreamers of dust rising from the feet of another's flock, and the\ninterest became intense.\n\nBill was arduously cooking his dinner, bending over the fire, and\ntoiling like a blacksmith. A movement, a flash of strange colour,\nperhaps, off in the bushes, caused him suddenly to turn his head.\nPresently he arose, and, shading his eyes with his hand, stood\nmotionless and gazing. He perceived at last a Mexican sheep-herder\nwinding through the brush toward his camp.\n\n\"Hello!\" shouted Bill.\n\nThe Mexican made no answer, but came steadily forward until he was\nwithin some twenty yards. There he paused, and, folding his arms,\ndrew himself up in the manner affected by the villain in the play.\nHis serape muffled the lower part of his face, and his great sombrero\nshaded his brow. Being unexpected and also silent, he had something of\nthe quality of an apparition; moreover, it was clearly his intention to\nbe mysterious and devilish.\n\nThe American's pipe, sticking carelessly in the corner of his mouth,\nwas twisted until the wrong side was uppermost, and he held his\nfrying-pan poised in the air. He surveyed with evident surprise this\napparition in the mesquit. \"Hello, Jos\u00c3\u00a9!\" he said; \"what's the matter?\"\n\nThe Mexican spoke with the solemnity of funeral tollings: \"Beel,\nyou mus' geet off range. We want you geet off range. We no like.\nUn'erstan'? We no like.\"\n\n\"What you talking about?\" said Bill. \"No like what?\"\n\n\"We no like you here. Un'erstan'? Too mooch. You mus' geet out. We no\nlike. Un'erstan'?\"\n\n\"Understand? No; I don't know what the blazes you're gittin' at.\"\nBill's eyes wavered in bewilderment, and his jaw fell. \"I must git out?\nI must git off the range? What you givin' us?\"\n\nThe Mexican unfolded his serape with his small yellow hand. Upon his\nface was then to be seen a smile that was gently, almost caressingly\nmurderous. \"Beel,\" he said, \"geet out!\"\n\nBill's arm dropped until the frying-pan was at his knee. Finally he\nturned again toward the fire. \"Go on, you dog-gone little yaller rat!\"\nhe said over his shoulder. \"You fellers can't chase me off this range.\nI got as much right here as anybody.\"\n\n\"Beel,\" answered the other in a vibrant tone, thrusting his head\nforward and moving one foot, \"you geet out or we keel you.\"\n\n\"Who will?\" said Bill.\n\n\"I--and the others.\" The Mexican tapped his breast gracefully.\n\nBill reflected for a time, and then he said: \"You ain't got no manner\nof license to warn me off'n this range, and I won't move a rod.\nUnderstand? I've got rights, and I suppose if I don't see 'em through,\nno one is likely to give me a good hand and help me lick you fellers,\nsince I'm the only white man in half a day's ride. Now, look; if you\nfellers try to rush this camp, I'm goin' to plug about fifty per cent.\nof the gentlemen present, sure. I'm goin' in for trouble, an' I'll\ngit a lot of you. 'Nuther thing: if I was a fine valuable caballero\nlike you, I'd stay in the rear till the shootin' was done, because I'm\ngoin' to make a particular p'int of shootin' you through the chest.\" He\ngrinned affably, and made a gesture of dismissal.\n\nAs for the Mexican, he waved his hands in a consummate expression\nof indifference. \"Oh, all right,\" he said. Then, in a tone of deep\nmenace and glee, he added: \"We will keel you eef you no geet. They have\ndecide'.\"\n\n\"They have, have they?\" said Bill. \"Well, you tell them to go to the\ndevil!\"\n\n\n                   II\n\nBill had been a mine-owner in Wyoming, a great man, an aristocrat,\none who possessed unlimited credit in the saloons down the gulch. He\nhad the social weight that could interrupt a lynching or advise a bad\nman of the particular merits of a remote geographical point. However,\nthe fates exploded the toy balloon with which they had amused Bill,\nand on the evening of the same day he was a professional gambler with\nill-fortune dealing him unspeakable irritation in the shape of three\nbig cards whenever another fellow stood pat. It is well here to inform\nthe world that Bill considered his calamities of life all dwarfs in\ncomparison with the excitement of one particular evening, when three\nkings came to him with criminal regularity against a man who always\nfilled a straight. Later he became a cow-boy, more weirdly abandoned\nthan if he had never been an aristocrat. By this time all that remained\nof his former splendour was his pride, or his vanity, which was one\nthing which need not have remained. He killed the foreman of the ranch\nover an inconsequent matter as to which of them was a liar, and the\nmidnight train carried him eastward. He became a brakeman on the Union\nPacific, and really gained high honours in the hobo war that for many\nyears has devastated the beautiful railroads of our country. A creature\nof ill-fortune himself, he practised all the ordinary cruelties upon\nthese other creatures of ill-fortune. He was of so fierce a mien that\ntramps usually surrendered at once whatever coin or tobacco they had\nin their possession; and if afterward he kicked them from the train,\nit was only because this was a recognized treachery of the war upon\nthe hoboes. In a famous battle fought in Nebraska in 1879, he would\nhave achieved a lasting distinction if it had not been for a deserter\nfrom the United States army. He was at the head of a heroic and\nsweeping charge, which really broke the power of the hoboes in that\ncountry for three months; he had already worsted four tramps with\nhis own coupling-stick, when a stone thrown by the ex-third baseman\nof F Troop's nine laid him flat on the prairie, and later enforced\na stay in the hospital in Omaha. After his recovery he engaged with\nother railroads, and shuffled cars in countless yards. An order to\nstrike came upon him in Michigan, and afterward the vengeance of the\nrailroad pursued him until he assumed a name. This mask is like the\ndarkness in which the burglar chooses to move. It destroys many of the\nhealthy fears. It is a small thing, but it eats that which we call our\nconscience. The conductor of No. 419 stood in the caboose within two\nfeet of Bill's nose, and called him a liar. Bill requested him to use\na milder term. He had not bored the foreman of Tin Can Ranch with any\nsuch request, but had killed him with expedition. The conductor seemed\nto insist, and so Bill let the matter drop.\n\nHe became the bouncer of a saloon on the Bowery in New York. Here most\nof his fights were as successful as had been his brushes with the\nhoboes in the West. He gained the complete admiration of the four clean\nbar-tenders who stood behind the great and glittering bar. He was an\nhonoured man. He nearly killed Bad Hennessy, who, as a matter of fact,\nhad more reputation than ability, and his fame moved up the Bowery and\ndown the Bowery.\n\nBut let a man adopt fighting as his business, and the thought grows\nconstantly within him that it is his business to fight. These phrases\nbecame mixed in Bill's mind precisely as they are here mixed; and let\na man get this idea in his mind, and defeat begins to move toward him\nover the unknown ways of circumstances. One summer night three sailors\nfrom the U.S.S. _Seattle_ sat in the saloon drinking and attending to\nother people's affairs in an amiable fashion. Bill was a proud man\nsince he had thrashed so many citizens, and it suddenly occurred to him\nthat the loud talk of the sailors was very offensive. So he swaggered\nupon their attention, and warned them that the saloon was the flowery\nabode of peace and gentle silence. They glanced at him in surprise, and\nwithout a moment's pause consigned him to a worse place than any stoker\nof them knew. Whereupon he flung one of them through the side door\nbefore the others could prevent it. On the sidewalk there was a short\nstruggle, with many hoarse epithets in the air, and then Bill slid\ninto the saloon again. A frown of false rage was upon his brow, and\nhe strutted like a savage king. He took a long yellow night-stick from\nbehind the lunch-counter, and started importantly toward the main doors\nto see that the incensed seamen did not again enter.\n\nThe ways of sailormen are without speech, and, together in the street,\nthe three sailors exchanged no word, but they moved at once. Landsmen\nwould have required two years of discussion to gain such unanimity. In\nsilence, and immediately, they seized a long piece of scantling that\nlay handily. With one forward to guide the battering-ram, and with two\nbehind him to furnish the power, they made a beautiful curve, and came\ndown like the Assyrians on the front door of that saloon.\n\nMystic and still mystic are the laws of fate. Bill, with his kingly\nfrown and his long night-stick, appeared at precisely that moment\nin the doorway. He stood like a statue of victory; his pride was at\nits zenith; and in the same second this atrocious piece of scantling\npunched him in the bulwarks of his stomach, and he vanished like a\nmist. Opinions differed as to where the end of the scantling landed\nhim, but it was ultimately clear that it landed him in south-western\nTexas, where he became a sheep-herder.\n\nThe sailors charged three times upon the plate-glass front of the\nsaloon, and when they had finished, it looked as if it had been the\nvictim of a rural fire company's success in saving it from the flames.\nAs the proprietor of the place surveyed the ruins, he remarked that\nBill was a very zealous guardian of property. As the ambulance surgeon\nsurveyed Bill, he remarked that the wound was really an excavation.\n\n\n                   III\n\nAs his Mexican friend tripped blithely away, Bill turned with a\nthoughtful face to his frying-pan and his fire. After dinner he drew\nhis revolver from its scarred old holster, and examined every part of\nit. It was the revolver that had dealt death to the foreman, and it\nhad also been in free fights in which it had dealt death to several or\nnone. Bill loved it because its allegiance was more than that of man,\nhorse, or dog. It questioned neither social nor moral position; it\nobeyed alike the saint and the assassin. It was the claw of the eagle,\nthe tooth of the lion, the poison of the snake; and when he swept\nit from its holster, this minion smote where he listed, even to the\nbattering of a far penny. Wherefore it was his dearest possession, and\nwas not to be exchanged in south-western Texas for a handful of rubies,\nnor even the shame and homage of the conductor of No. 419.\n\nDuring the afternoon he moved through his monotony of work and leisure\nwith the same air of deep meditation. The smoke of his supper-time fire\nwas curling across the shadowy sea of mesquit when the instinct of the\nplainsman warned him that the stillness, the desolation, was again\ninvaded. He saw a motionless horseman in black outline against the\npallid sky. The silhouette displayed serape and sombrero, and even the\nMexican spurs as large as pies. When this black figure began to move\ntoward the camp, Bill's hand dropped to his revolver.\n\nThe horseman approached until Bill was enabled to see pronounced\nAmerican features, and a skin too red to grow on a Mexican face. Bill\nreleased his grip on his revolver.\n\n\"Hello!\" called the horseman.\n\n\"Hello!\" answered Bill.\n\nThe horseman cantered forward. \"Good evening,\" he said, as he again\ndrew rein.\n\n\"Good evenin',\" answered Bill, without committing himself by too much\ncourtesy.\n\nFor a moment the two men scanned each other in a way that is not\nill-mannered on the plains, where one is in danger of meeting\nhorse-thieves or tourists.\n\nBill saw a type which did not belong in the mesquit. The young fellow\nhad invested in some Mexican trappings of an expensive kind. Bill's\neyes searched the outfit for some sign of craft, but there was none.\nEven with his local regalia, it was clear that the young man was of a\nfar, black Northern city. He had discarded the enormous stirrups of\nhis Mexican saddle; he used the small English stirrup, and his feet\nwere thrust forward until the steel tightly gripped his ankles. As\nBill's eyes travelled over the stranger, they lighted suddenly upon the\nstirrups and the thrust feet, and immediately he smiled in a friendly\nway. No dark purpose could dwell in the innocent heart of a man who\nrode thus on the plains.\n\nAs for the stranger, he saw a tattered individual with a tangle of hair\nand beard, and with a complexion turned brick-colour from the sun and\nwhisky. He saw a pair of eyes that at first looked at him as the wolf\nlooks at the wolf, and then became childlike, almost timid, in their\nglance. Here was evidently a man who had often stormed the iron walls\nof the city of success, and who now sometimes valued himself as the\nrabbit values his prowess.\n\nThe stranger smiled genially, and sprang from his horse. \"Well, sir, I\nsuppose you will let me camp here with you to-night?\"\n\n\"Eh?\" said Bill.\n\n\"I suppose you will let me camp here with you to-night?\"\n\nBill for a time seemed too astonished for words. \"Well,\"--he answered,\nscowling in inhospitable annoyance--\"well, I don't believe this here is\na good place to camp to-night, mister.\"\n\nThe stranger turned quickly from his saddle-girth.\n\n\"What?\" he said in surprise. \"You don't want me here? You don't want me\nto camp here?\"\n\nBill's feet scuffled awkwardly, and he looked steadily at a cactus\nplant. \"Well, you see, mister,\" he said, \"I'd like your company well\nenough, but--you see, some of these here greasers are goin' to chase\nme off the range to-night; and while I might like a man's company all\nright, I couldn't let him in for no such game when he ain't got nothin'\nto do with the trouble.\"\n\n\"Going to chase you off the range?\" cried the stranger.\n\n\"Well, they said they were goin' to do it,\" said Bill.\n\n\"And--great heavens! will they kill you, do you think?\"\n\n\"Don't know. Can't tell till afterwards. You see, they take some feller\nthat's alone like me, and then they rush his camp when he ain't quite\nready for 'em, and ginerally plug 'im with a sawed-off shot-gun load\nbefore he has a chance to git at 'em. They lay around and wait for\ntheir chance, and it comes soon enough. Of course a feller alone like\nme has got to let up watching some time. Maybe they ketch 'im asleep.\nMaybe the feller gits tired waiting, and goes out in broad day, and\nkills two or three just to make the whole crowd pile on him and settle\nthe thing. I heard of a case like that once. It's awful hard on a man's\nmind--to git a gang after him.\"\n\n\"And so they're going to rush your camp to-night?\" cried the stranger.\n\"How do you know? Who told you?\"\n\n\"Feller come and told me.\"\n\n\"And what are you going to do? Fight?\"\n\n\"Don't see nothin' else to do,\" answered Bill gloomily, still staring\nat the cactus plant.\n\nThere was a silence. Finally the stranger burst out in an amazed cry.\n\"Well, I never heard of such a thing in my life! How many of them are\nthere?\"\n\n\"Eight,\" answered Bill. \"And now look-a-here; you ain't got no manner\nof business foolin' around here just now, and you might better lope\noff before dark. I don't ask no help in this here row. I know your\nhappening along here just now don't give me no call on you, and you\nbetter hit the trail.\"\n\n\"Well, why in the name of wonder don't you go get the sheriff?\" cried\nthe stranger.\n\n\"Oh, h----!\" said Bill.\n\n\n                   IV\n\nLong, smoldering clouds spread in the western sky, and to the east\nsilver mists lay on the purple gloom of the wilderness.\n\nFinally, when the great moon climbed the heavens and cast its ghastly\nradiance upon the bushes, it made a new and more brilliant crimson of\nthe campfire, where the flames capered merrily through its mesquit\nbranches, filling the silence with the fire chorus, an ancient melody\nwhich surely bears a message of the inconsequence of individual\ntragedy--a message that is in the boom of the sea, the sliver of the\nwind through the grass-blades, the silken clash of hemlock boughs.\n\nNo figures moved in the rosy space of the camp, and the search of the\nmoonbeams failed to disclose a living thing in the bushes. There was no\nowl-faced clock to chant the weariness of the long silence that brooded\nupon the plain.\n\nThe dew gave the darkness under the mesquit a velvet quality that\nmade air seem nearer to water, and no eye could have seen through it\nthe black things that moved like monster lizards toward the camp. The\nbranches, the leaves, that are fain to cry out when death approaches in\nthe wilds, were frustrated by these uncanny bodies gliding with the\nfinesse of the escaping serpent. They crept forward to the last point\nwhere assuredly no frantic attempt of the fire could discover them, and\nthere they paused to locate the prey. A romance relates the tale of the\nblack cell hidden deep in the earth, where, upon entering, one sees\nonly the little eyes of snakes fixing him in menaces. If a man could\nhave approached a certain spot in the bushes, he would not have found\nit romantically necessary to have his hair rise. There would have been\na sufficient expression of horror in the feeling of the death-hand at\nthe nape of his neck and in his rubber knee-joints.\n\nTwo of these bodies finally moved toward each other until for each\nthere grew out of the darkness a face placidly smiling with tender\ndreams of assassination. \"The fool is asleep by the fire, God be\npraised!\" The lips of the other widened in a grin of affectionate\nappreciation of the fool and his plight. There was some signaling in\nthe gloom, and then began a series of subtle rustlings, interjected\noften with pauses, during which no sound arose but the sound of faint\nbreathing.\n\nA bush stood like a rock in the stream of firelight, sending its long\nshadow backward. With painful caution the little company travelled\nalong this shadow, and finally arrived at the rear of the bush. Through\nits branches they surveyed for a moment of comfortable satisfaction a\nform in a grey blanket extended on the ground near the fire. The smile\nof joyful anticipation fled quickly, to give place to a quiet air of\nbusiness. Two men lifted shot-guns with much of the barrels gone, and\nsighting these weapons through the branches, pulled trigger together.\n\nThe noise of the explosions roared over the lonely mesquit as if these\nguns wished to inform the entire world; and as the grey smoke fled,\nthe dodging company back of the bush saw the blanketed form twitching;\nwhereupon they burst out in chorus in a laugh, and arose as merry as a\nlot of banqueters. They gleefully gestured congratulations, and strode\nbravely into the light of the fire.\n\nThen suddenly a new laugh rang from some unknown spot in the darkness.\nIt was a fearsome laugh of ridicule, hatred, ferocity. It might have\nbeen demoniac. It smote them motionless in their gleeful prowl, as the\nstern voice from the sky smites the legendary malefactor. They might\nhave been a weird group in wax, the light of the dying fire on their\nyellow faces, and shining athwart their eyes turned toward the darkness\nwhence might come the unknown and the terrible.\n\nThe thing in the grey blanket no longer twitched; but if the knives in\ntheir hands had been thrust toward it, each knife was now drawn back,\nand its owner's elbow was thrown upward, as if he expected death from\nthe clouds.\n\nThis laugh had so chained their reason that for a moment they had no\nwit to flee. They were prisoners to their terror. Then suddenly the\nbelated decision arrived, and with bubbling cries they turned to run;\nbut at that instant there was a long flash of red in the darkness, and\nwith the report one of the men shouted a bitter shout, spun once, and\ntumbled headlong. The thick bushes failed to impede the route of the\nothers.\n\nThe silence returned to the wilderness. The tired flames faintly\nillumined the blanketed thing and the flung corpse of the marauder, and\nsang the fire chorus, the ancient melody which bears the message of the\ninconsequence of human tragedy.\n\n\n                   V\n\n\"Now you are worse off than ever,\" said the young man, dry-voiced and\nawed.\n\n\"No, I ain't,\" said Bill rebelliously. \"I'm one ahead.\"\n\nAfter reflection, the stranger remarked, \"Well, there's seven more.\"\n\nThey were cautiously and slowly approaching the camp. The sun was\nflaring its first warming rays over the grey wilderness. Upreared\ntwigs, prominent branches, shone with golden light, while the shadows\nunder the mesquit were heavily blue.\n\nSuddenly the stranger uttered a frightened cry. He had arrived at a\npoint whence he had, through openings in the thicket, a clear view of a\ndead face.\n\n\"Gosh!\" said Bill, who at the next instant had seen the thing; \"I\nthought at first it was that there Jos\u00c3\u00a9. That would have been queer,\nafter what I told 'im yesterday.\"\n\nThey continued their way, the stranger wincing in his walk, and Bill\nexhibiting considerable curiosity.\n\nThe yellow beams of the new sun were touching the grim hues of the\ndead Mexican's face, and creating there an inhuman effect, which made\nhis countenance more like a mask of dulled brass. One hand, grown\ncuriously thinner, had been flung out regardlessly to a cactus bush.\n\nBill walked forward and stood looking respectfully at the body. \"I know\nthat feller; his name is Miguel. He----\"\n\nThe stranger's nerves might have been in that condition when there\nis no backbone to the body, only a long groove. \"Good heavens!\" he\nexclaimed, much agitated; \"don't speak that way!\"\n\n\"What way?\" said Bill. \"I only said his name was Miguel.\"\n\nAfter a pause the stranger said:\n\n\"Oh, I know; but----\" He waved his hand. \"Lower your voice, or\nsomething. I don't know. This part of the business rattles me, don't\nyou see?\"\n\n\"Oh, all right,\" replied Bill, bowing to the other's mysterious\nmood. But in a moment he burst out violently and loud in the most\nextraordinary profanity, the oaths winging from him as the sparks go\nfrom the funnel.\n\nHe had been examining the contents of the bundled grey blanket, and\nhe had brought forth, among other things, his frying-pan. It was now\nonly a rim with a handle; the Mexican volley had centered upon it. A\nMexican shot-gun of the abbreviated description is ordinarily loaded\nwith flat-irons, stove-lids, lead pipe, old horseshoes, sections of\nchain, window weights, railroad sleepers and spikes, dumb-bells, and\nany other junk which may be at hand. When one of these loads encounters\na man vitally, it is likely to make an impression upon him, and a\ncooking-utensil may be supposed to subside before such an assault of\ncuriosities.\n\nBill held high his desecrated frying-pan, turning it this way and that\nway. He swore until he happened to note the absence of the stranger. A\nmoment later he saw him leading his horse from the bushes. In silence\nand sullenly the young man went about saddling the animal. Bill said,\n\"Well, goin' to pull out?\"\n\nThe stranger's hands fumbled uncertainly at the throat-latch. Once\nhe exclaimed irritably, blaming the buckle for the trembling of his\nfingers. Once he turned to look at the dead face with the light of the\nmorning sun upon it. At last he cried, \"Oh, I know the whole thing was\nall square enough--couldn't be squarer--but--somehow or other, that\nman there takes the heart out of me.\" He turned his troubled face for\nanother look. \"He seems to be all the time calling me a--he makes me\nfeel like a murderer.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Bill, puzzling, \"you didn't shoot him, mister; I shot him.\"\n\n\"I know; but I feel that way, somehow. I can't get rid of it.\"\n\nBill considered for a time; then he said diffidently, \"Mister, you're a\neddycated man, ain't you?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"You're what they call a--a eddycated man, ain't you?\"\n\nThe young man, perplexed, evidently had a question upon his lips, when\nthere was a roar of guns, bright flashes, and in the air such hooting\nand whistling as would come from a swift flock of steam-boilers. The\nstranger's horse gave a mighty, convulsive spring, snorting wildly in\nits sudden anguish, fell upon its knees, scrambled afoot again, and was\naway in the uncanny death run known to men who have seen the finish of\nbrave horses.\n\n\"This comes from discussin' things,\" cried Bill angrily.\n\nHe had thrown himself flat on the ground facing the thicket whence had\ncome the firing. He could see the smoke winding over the bush-tops.\nHe lifted his revolver, and the weapon came slowly up from the ground\nand poised like the glittering crest of a snake. Somewhere on his face\nthere was a kind of smile, cynical, wicked, deadly, of a ferocity which\nat the same time had brought a deep flush to his face, and had caused\ntwo upright lines to glow in his eyes.\n\n\"Hello, Jos\u00c3\u00a9!\" he called, amiable for satire's sake. \"Got your old\nblunderbusses loaded up again yet?\"\n\nThe stillness had returned to the plain. The sun's brilliant rays swept\nover the sea of mesquit, painting the far mists of the west with faint\nrosy light, and high in the air some great bird fled toward the south.\n\n\"You come out here,\" called Bill, again addressing the landscape, \"and\nI'll give you some shootin' lessons. That ain't the way to shoot.\"\nReceiving no reply, he began to invent epithets and yell them at\nthe thicket. He was something of a master of insult, and, moreover,\nhe dived into his memory to bring forth imprecations tarnished with\nage, unused since fluent Bowery days. The occupation amused him, and\nsometimes he laughed so that it was uncomfortable for his chest to be\nagainst the ground.\n\nFinally the stranger, prostrate near him, said wearily, \"Oh, they've\ngone.\"\n\n\"Don't you believe it,\" replied Bill, sobering swiftly. \"They're there\nyet--every man of 'em.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"Because I do. They won't shake us so soon. Don't put your head up, or\nthey'll get you, sure.\"\n\nBill's eyes, meanwhile, had not wavered from their scrutiny of the\nthicket in front. \"They're there all right; don't you forget it. Now\nyou listen.\" So he called out: \"Jos\u00c3\u00a9! Ojo, Jos\u00c3\u00a9! Speak up, _hombre_! I\nwant have talk. Speak up, you yaller cuss, you!\"\n\nWhereupon a mocking voice from off in the bushes said, \"Se\u00c3\u00b1or?\"\n\n\"There,\" said Bill to his ally; \"didn't I tell you? The whole batch.\"\nAgain he lifted his voice. \"Jos\u00c3\u00a9--look--ain't you gittin' kinder tired?\nYou better go home, you fellers, and git some rest.\"\n\nThe answer was a sudden furious chatter of Spanish, eloquent with\nhatred, calling down upon Bill all the calamities which life holds. It\nwas as if some one had suddenly enraged a cageful of wild cats. The\nspirits of all the revenges which they had imagined were loosened at\nthis time, and filled the air.\n\n\"They're in a holler,\" said Bill, chuckling, \"or there'd be shootin'.\"\n\nPresently he began to grow angry. His hidden enemies called him nine\nkinds of coward, a man who could fight only in the dark, a baby who\nwould run from the shadows of such noble Mexican gentlemen, a dog that\nsneaked. They described the affair of the previous night, and informed\nhim of the base advantage he had taken of their friend. In fact,\nthey in all sincerity endowed him with every quality which he no less\nearnestly believed them to possess. One could have seen the phrases\nbite him as he lay there on the ground fingering his revolver.\n\n\n                   VI\n\nIt is sometimes taught that men do the furious and desperate thing from\nan emotion that is as even and placid as the thoughts of a village\nclergyman on Sunday afternoon. Usually, however, it is to be believed\nthat a panther is at the time born in the heart, and that the subject\ndoes not resemble a man picking mulberries.\n\n\"B' G----!\" said Bill, speaking as from a throat filled with dust,\n\"I'll go after 'em in a minute.\"\n\n\"Don't you budge an inch!\" cried the stranger, sternly. \"Don't you\nbudge!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Bill, glaring at the bushes--\"well--\"\n\n\"Put your head down!\" suddenly screamed the stranger, in white alarm.\nAs the guns roared, Bill uttered a loud grunt, and for a moment leaned\npanting on his elbow, while his arm shook like a twig. Then he upreared\nlike a great and bloody spirit of vengeance, his face lighted with the\nblaze of his last passion. The Mexicans came swiftly and in silence.\n\nThe lightning action of the next few moments was of the fabric of\ndreams to the stranger. The muscular struggle may not be real to the\ndrowning man. His mind may be fixed on the far, straight shadows back\nof the stars, and the terror of them. And so the fight, and his part in\nit, had to the stranger only the quality of a picture half drawn. The\nrush of feet, the spatter of shots, the cries, the swollen faces seen\nlike masks on the smoke, resembled a happening of the night.\n\nAnd yet afterward certain lines, forms, lived out so strongly from the\nincoherence that they were always in his memory.\n\nHe killed a man, and the thought went swiftly by him, like the feather\non the gale, that it was easy to kill a man.\n\nMoreover, he suddenly felt for Bill, this grimy sheep-herder, some deep\nform of idolatry. Bill was dying, and the dignity of last defeat, the\nsuperiority of him who stands in his grave, was in the pose of the lost\nsheep-herder.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThe stranger sat on the ground idly mopping the sweat and powder-stain\nfrom his brow. He wore the gentle idiot smile of an aged beggar as he\nwatched three Mexicans limping and staggering in the distance. He noted\nat this time that one who still possessed a serape had from it none\nof the grandeur of the cloaked Spaniard, but that against the sky the\nsilhouette resembled a cornucopia of childhood's Christmas.\n\nThey turned to look at him, and he lifted his weary arm to menace them\nwith his revolver. They stood for a moment banded together, and hooted\ncurses at him.\n\nFinally he arose, and, walking some paces, stooped to loosen Bill's\ngrey hands from a throat. Swaying as if slightly drunk, he stood\nlooking down into the still face.\n\nStruck suddenly with a thought, he went about with dulled eyes on the\nground, until he plucked his gaudy blanket from where it lay dirty from\ntrampling feet. He dusted it carefully, and then returned and laid it\nover Bill's form. There he again stood motionless, his mouth just agape\nand the same stupid glance in his eyes, when all at once he made a\ngesture of fright and looked wildly about him.\n\nHe had almost reached the thicket when he stopped, smitten with alarm.\nA body contorted, with one arm stiff in the air, lay in his path.\nSlowly and warily he moved around it, and in a moment the bushes,\nnodding and whispering, their leaf-faces turned toward the scene\nbehind him, swung and swung again into stillness and the peace of the\nwilderness.\n\n\n\n\n     THE BRIDE COMES TO YELLOW SKY\n\n\n                   I\n\nThe great Pullman was whirling onward with such dignity of motion\nthat a glance from the window seemed simply to prove that the plains\nof Texas were pouring eastward. Vast flats of green grass, dull-hued\nspaces of mesquit and cactus, little groups of frame houses, woods of\nlight and tender trees, all were sweeping into the east, sweeping over\nthe horizon, a precipice.\n\nA newly-married pair had boarded this train at San Antonio. The man's\nface was reddened from many days in the wind and sun, and a direct\nresult of his new black clothes was that his brick-coloured hands were\nconstantly performing in a most conscious fashion. From time to time\nhe looked down respectfully at his attire. He sat with a hand on each\nknee, like a man waiting in a barber's shop. The glances he devoted to\nother passengers were furtive and shy.\n\nThe bride was not pretty, nor was she very young. She wore a dress\nof blue cashmere, with small reservations of velvet here and there,\nand with steel buttons abounding. She continually twisted her head\nto regard her puff-sleeves, very stiff, straight, and high. They\nembarrassed her. It was quite apparent that she had cooked, and that\nshe expected to cook, dutifully. The blushes caused by the careless\nscrutiny of some passengers as she had entered the car were strange\nto see upon this plain, under-class countenance, which was drawn in\nplacid, almost emotionless lines.\n\nThey were evidently very happy. \"Ever been in a parlour-car before?\" he\nasked, smiling with delight.\n\n\"No,\" she answered; \"I never was. It's fine, ain't it?\"\n\n\"Great. And then, after a while, we'll go forward to the diner, and get\na big lay-out. Finest meal in the world. Charge, a dollar.\"\n\n\"Oh, do they?\" cried the bride. \"Charge a dollar? Why, that's too\nmuch--for us--ain't it, Jack?\"\n\n\"Not this trip, anyhow,\" he answered bravely. \"We're going to go the\nwhole thing.\"\n\nLater, he explained to her about the train. \"You see, it's a thousand\nmiles from one end of Texas to the other, and this train runs right\nacross it, and never stops but four times.\"\n\nHe had the pride of an owner. He pointed out to her the dazzling\nfittings of the coach, and, in truth, her eyes opened wider as she\ncontemplated the sea-green figured velvet, the shining brass, silver,\nand glass, the wood that gleamed as darkly brilliant as the surface\nof a pool of oil. At one end a bronze figure sturdily held a support\nfor a separated chamber, and at convenient places on the ceiling were\nfrescoes in olive and silver.\n\nTo the minds of the pair, their surroundings reflected the glory of\ntheir marriage that morning in San Antonio. This was the environment\nof their new estate, and the man's face, in particular, beamed with\nan elation that made him appear ridiculous to the negro porter. This\nindividual at times surveyed them from afar with an amused and superior\ngrin. On other occasions he bullied them with skill in ways that did\nnot make it exactly plain to them that they were being bullied. He\nsubtly used all the manners of the most unconquerable kind of snobbery.\nHe oppressed them, but of this oppression they had small knowledge, and\nthey speedily forgot that unfrequently a number of travellers covered\nthem with stares of derisive enjoyment. Historically there was supposed\nto be something infinitely humorous in their situation.\n\n\"We are due in Yellow Sky at 3.42,\" he said, looking tenderly into her\neyes.\n\n\"Oh, are we?\" she said, as if she had not been aware of it.\n\nTo evince surprise at her husband's statement was part of her wifely\namiability. She took from a pocket a little silver watch, and as she\nheld it before her, and stared at it with a frown of attention, the new\nhusband's face shone.\n\n\"I bought it in San Anton' from a friend of mine,\" he told her\ngleefully.\n\n\"It's seventeen minutes past twelve,\" she said, looking up at him with\na kind of shy and clumsy coquetry.\n\nA passenger, noting this play, grew excessively sardonic, and winked at\nhimself in one of the numerous mirrors.\n\nAt last they went to the dining-car. Two rows of negro waiters in\ndazzling white suits surveyed their entrance with the interest, and\nalso the equanimity, of men who had been forewarned. The pair fell to\nthe lot of a waiter who happened to feel pleasure in steering them\nthrough their meal. He viewed them with the manner of a fatherly pilot,\nhis countenance radiant with benevolence. The patronage entwined with\nthe ordinary deference was not palpable to them. And yet as they\nreturned to their coach they showed in their faces a sense of escape.\n\nTo the left, miles down a long purple slope, was a little ribbon of\nmist, where moved the keening Rio Grande. The train was approaching it\nat an angle, and the apex was Yellow Sky. Presently it was apparent\nthat as the distance from Yellow Sky grew shorter, the husband became\ncommensurately restless. His brick-red hands were more insistent in\ntheir prominence. Occasionally he was even rather absent-minded and far\naway when the bride leaned forward and addressed him.\n\nAs a matter of truth, Jack Potter was beginning to find the shadow of a\ndeed weigh upon him like a leaden slab. He, the town-marshal of Yellow\nSky, a man known, liked, and feared in his corner, a prominent person,\nhad gone to San Antonio to meet a girl he believed he loved, and there,\nafter the usual prayers, had actually induced her to marry him without\nconsulting Yellow Sky for any part of the transaction. He was now\nbringing his bride before an innocent and unsuspecting community.\n\nOf course, people in Yellow Sky married as it pleased them in\naccordance with a general custom, but such was Potter's thought of his\nduty to his friends, or of their idea of his duty, or of an unspoken\nform which does not control men in these matters, that he felt he was\nheinous. He had committed an extraordinary crime. Face to face with\nthis girl in San Antonio, and spurred by his sharp impulse, he had gone\nheadlong over all the social hedges. At San Antonio he was like a man\nhidden in the dark. A knife to sever any friendly duty, any form, was\neasy to his hand in that remote city. But the hour of Yellow Sky, the\nhour of daylight, was approaching.\n\nHe knew full well that his marriage was an important thing to his\ntown. It could only be exceeded by the burning of the new hotel. His\nfriends would not forgive him. Frequently he had reflected upon the\nadvisability of telling them by telegraph, but a new cowardice had been\nupon him. He feared to do it. And now the train was hurrying him toward\na scene of amazement, glee, reproach. He glanced out of the window at\nthe line of haze swinging slowly in toward the train.\n\nYellow Sky had a kind of brass band which played painfully to the\ndelight of the populace. He laughed without heart as he thought of it.\nIf the citizens could dream of his prospective arrival with his bride,\nthey would parade the band at the station, and escort them, amid\ncheers and laughing congratulations, to his adobe home.\n\nHe resolved that he would use all the devices of speed and plainscraft\nin making the journey from the station to his house. Once within that\nsafe citadel, he could issue some sort of a vocal bulletin, and then\nnot go among the citizens until they had time to wear off a little of\ntheir enthusiasm.\n\nThe bride looked anxiously at him. \"What's worrying you, Jack?\"\n\nHe laughed again. \"I'm not worrying, girl. I'm only thinking of Yellow\nSky.\"\n\nShe flushed in comprehension.\n\nA sense of mutual guilt invaded their minds, and developed a finer\ntenderness. They looked at each other with eyes softly aglow. But\nPotter often laughed the same nervous laugh. The flush upon the bride's\nface seemed quite permanent.\n\nThe traitor to the feelings of Yellow Sky narrowly watched the speeding\nlandscape.\n\n\"We're nearly there,\" he said.\n\nPresently the porter came and announced the proximity of Potter's home.\nHe held a brush in his hand, and, with all his airy superiority gone,\nhe brushed Potter's new clothes, as the latter slowly turned this way\nand that way. Potter fumbled out a coin, and gave it to the porter as\nhe had seen others do. It was a heavy and muscle-bound business, as\nthat of a man shoeing his first horse.\n\nThe porter took their bag, and, as the train began to slow, they moved\nforward to the hooded platform of the car. Presently the two engines\nand their long string of coaches rushed into the station of Yellow Sky.\n\n\"They have to take water here,\" said Potter, from a constricted throat,\nand in mournful cadence as one announcing death. Before the train\nstopped his eye had swept the length of the platform, and he was glad\nand astonished to see there was no one upon it but the station-agent,\nwho, with a slightly hurried and anxious air, was walking toward the\nwater-tanks. When the train had halted, the porter alighted first and\nplaced in position a little temporary step.\n\n\"Come on, girl,\" said Potter, hoarsely.\n\nAs he helped her down, they each laughed on a false note. He took the\nbag from the negro, and bade his wife cling to his arm. As they slunk\nrapidly away, his hang-dog glance perceived that they were unloading\nthe two trunks, and also that the station-agent, far ahead, near the\nbaggage-car, had turned, and was running toward him, making gestures.\nHe laughed, and groaned as he laughed, when he noted the first effect\nof his marital bliss upon Yellow Sky. He gripped his wife's arm firmly\nto his side, and they fled. Behind them the porter stood chuckling\nfatuously.\n\n\n                   II\n\nThe California Express on the Southron Railway was due at Yellow Sky\nin twenty-one minutes. There were six men at the bar of the Weary\nGentleman saloon. One was a drummer, who talked a great deal and\nrapidly; three were Texans, who did not care to talk at that time;\nand two were Mexican sheep-herders, who did not talk as a general\npractice in the Weary Gentleman saloon. The bar-keeper's dog lay on the\nboard-walk that crossed in front of the door. His head was on his paws,\nand he glanced drowsily here and there with the constant vigilance of\na dog that is kicked on occasion. Across the sandy street were some\nvivid green grass plots, so wonderful in appearance amid the sands that\nburned near them in a blazing sun, that they caused a doubt in the\nmind. They exactly resembled the grass-mats used to represent lawns on\nthe stage. At the cooler end of the railway-station a man without a\ncoat sat in a tilted chair and smoked his pipe. The fresh-cut bank of\nthe Rio Grande circled near the town, and there could be seen beyond it\na great plum-coloured plain of mesquit.\n\nSave for the busy drummer and his companions in the saloon, Yellow Sky\nwas dozing. The new-comer leaned gracefully upon the bar, and recited\nmany tales with the confidence of a bard who has come upon a new field.\n\n\"And at the moment that the old man fell down-stairs, with the bureau\nin his arms, the old woman was coming up with two scuttles of coal,\nand, of course----\"\n\nThe drummer's tale was interrupted by a young man who suddenly appeared\nin the open door. He cried--\n\n\"Scratchy Wilson's drunk, and has turned loose with both hands.\"\n\nThe two Mexicans at once set down their glasses, and faded out of the\nrear entrance of the saloon.\n\nThe drummer, innocent and jocular, answered--\n\n\"All right, old man. S'pose he has. Come and have a drink, anyhow.\"\n\nBut the information had made such an obvious cleft in every skull in\nthe room, that the drummer was obliged to see its importance. All had\nbecome instantly morose.\n\n\"Say,\" said he, mystified, \"what is this?\"\n\nHis three companions made the introductory gesture of eloquent speech,\nbut the young man at the door forestalled them.\n\n\"It means, my friend,\" he answered, as he came into the saloon, \"that\nfor the next two hours this town won't be a health resort.\"\n\nThe bar-keeper went to the door, and locked and barred it. Reaching\nout of the window, he pulled in heavy wooden shutters and barred them.\nImmediately a solemn, chapel-like gloom was upon the place. The drummer\nwas looking from one to another.\n\n\"But say,\" he cried, \"what is this, anyhow? You don't mean there is\ngoing to be a gun-fight?\"\n\n\"Don't know whether there'll be a fight or not,\" answered one man\ngrimly. \"But there'll be some shootin'--some good shootin'.\"\n\nThe young man who had warned them waved his hand. \"Oh, there'll be a\nfight, fast enough, if any one wants it. Anybody can get a fight out\nthere in the street. There's a fight just waiting.\"\n\nThe drummer seemed to be swayed between the interest of a foreigner,\nand a perception of personal danger.\n\n\"What did you say his name was?\" he asked.\n\n\"Scratchy Wilson,\" they answered in chorus.\n\n\"And will he kill anybody? What are you going to do? Does this happen\noften? Does he rampage round like this once a week or so? Can he break\nin that door?\"\n\n\"No, he can't break down that door,\" replied the bar-keeper. \"He's\ntried it three times. But when he comes you'd better lay down on the\nfloor, stranger. He's dead sure to shoot at it, and a bullet may come\nthrough.\"\n\nThereafter the drummer kept a strict eye on the door. The time had not\nyet been called for him to hug the floor, but as a minor precaution he\nsidled near to the wall.\n\n\"Will he kill anybody?\" he said again.\n\nThe men laughed low and scornfully at the question.\n\n\"He's out to shoot, and he's out for trouble. Don't see any good in\nexperimentin' with him.\"\n\n\"But what do you do in a case like this? What do you do?\"\n\nA man responded--\"Why, he and Jack Potter----\"\n\nBut, in chorus, the other men interrupted--\"Jack Potter's in San\nAnton'.\"\n\n\"Well, who is he? What's he got to do with it?\"\n\n\"Oh, he's the town-marshal. He goes out and fights Scratchy when he\ngets on one of these tears.\"\n\n\"Whow!\" said the drummer, mopping his brow. \"Nice job he's got.\"\n\nThe voices had toned away to mere whisperings. The drummer wished to\nask further questions, which were born of an increasing anxiety and\nbewilderment, but when he attempted them, the men merely looked at him\nin irritation, and motioned him to remain silent. A tense waiting hush\nwas upon them. In the deep shadows of the room their eyes shone as\nthey listened for sounds from the street. One man made three gestures\nat the bar-keeper, and the latter, moving like a ghost, handed him a\nglass and a bottle. The man poured a full glass of whisky, and set down\nthe bottle noiselessly. He gulped the whisky in a swallow, and turned\nagain toward the door in immovable silence. The drummer saw that the\nbar-keeper, without a sound, had taken a Winchester from beneath the\nbar. Later, he saw this individual beckoning to him, so he tip-toed\nacross the room.\n\n\"You better come with me back of the bar.\"\n\n\"No, thanks,\" said the drummer, perspiring. \"I'd rather be where I can\nmake a break for the back-door.\"\n\nWhereupon the man of bottles made a kindly but peremptory gesture.\nThe drummer obeyed it, and finding himself seated on a box, with his\nhead below the level of the bar, balm was laid upon his soul at sight\nof various zinc and copper fittings that bore a resemblance to plate\narmour. The bar-keeper took a seat comfortably upon an adjacent box.\n\n\"You see,\" he whispered, \"this here Scratchy Wilson is a wonder with a\ngun--a perfect wonder--and when he goes on the war-trail, we hunt our\nholes--naturally. He's about the last one of the old gang that used\nto hang out along the river here. He's a terror when he's drunk. When\nhe's sober he's all right--kind of simple--wouldn't hurt a fly--nicest\nfellow in town. But when he's drunk--whoo!\"\n\nThere were periods of stillness.\n\n\"I wish Jack Potter was back from San Anton',\" said the bar-keeper. \"He\nshot Wilson up once--in the leg--and he would sail in and pull out the\nkinks in this thing.\"\n\nPresently they heard from a distance the sound of a shot, followed\nby three wild yells. It instantly removed a bond from the men in the\ndarkened saloon. There was a shuffling of feet. They looked at each\nother.\n\n\"Here he comes,\" they said.\n\n\n                   III\n\nA man in a maroon-coloured flannel shirt, which had been purchased for\npurposes of decoration, and made, principally, by some Jewish women\non the east side of New York, rounded a corner and walked into the\nmiddle of the main street of Yellow Sky. In either hand the man held\na long, heavy blue-black revolver. Often he yelled, and these cries\nrang through a semblance of a deserted village, shrilly flying over\nthe roofs in a volume that seemed to have no relation to the ordinary\nvocal strength of a man. It was as if the surrounding stillness formed\nthe arch of a tomb over him. These cries of ferocious challenge rang\nagainst walls of silence. And his boots had red tops with gilded\nimprints, of the kind beloved in winter by little sledging boys on the\nhillsides of New England.\n\nThe man's face flamed in a rage begot of whisky. His eyes, rolling and\nyet keen for ambush, hunted the still door-ways and windows. He walked\nwith the creeping movement of the midnight cat. As it occurred to him,\nhe roared menacing information. The long revolvers in his hands were\nas easy as straws; they were moved with an electric swiftness. The\nlittle fingers of each hand played sometimes in a musician's way. Plain\nfrom the low collar of the shirt, the cords of his neck straightened\nand sank as passion moved him. The only sounds were his terrible\ninvitations. The calm adobes preserved their demeanour at the passing\nof this small thing in the middle of the street.\n\nThere was no offer of fight--no offer of fight. The man called to the\nsky. There were no attractions. He bellowed and fumed and swayed his\nrevolver here and everywhere.\n\nThe dog of the bar-keeper of the Weary Gentleman saloon had not\nappreciated the advance of events. He yet lay dozing in front of his\nmaster's door. At sight of the dog, the man paused and raised his\nrevolver humorously. At sight of the man, the dog sprang up and walked\ndiagonally away, with a sullen head and growling. The man yelled,\nand the dog broke into a gallop. As it was about to enter an alley,\nthere was a loud noise, a whistling, and something spat the ground\ndirectly before it. The dog screamed, and, wheeling in terror, galloped\nheadlong in a new direction. Again there was a noise, a whistling, and\nsand was kicked viciously before it. Fear-stricken, the dog turned and\nflurried like an animal in a pen. The man stood laughing, his weapons\nat his hips.\n\nUltimately the man was attracted by the closed door of the Weary\nGentleman saloon. He went to it, and, hammering with a revolver,\ndemanded drink.\n\nThe door remaining imperturbable, he picked a bit of paper from the\nwalk, and nailed it to the framework with a knife. He then turned his\nback contemptuously upon this popular resort, and, walking to the\nopposite side of the street and spinning there on his heel quickly and\nlithely, fired at the bit of paper. He missed it by a half-inch. He\nswore at himself, and went away. Later, he comfortably fusiladed the\nwindows of his most intimate friend. The man was playing with this\ntown. It was a toy for him.\n\nBut still there was no offer of fight. The name of Jack Potter, his\nancient antagonist, entered his mind, and he concluded that it would be\na glad thing if he should go to Potter's house, and, by bombardment,\ninduce him to come out and fight. He moved in the direction of his\ndesire, chanting Apache scalp music.\n\nWhen he arrived at it, Potter's house presented the same still, calm\nfront as had the other adobes. Taking up a strategic position, the\nman howled a challenge. But this house regarded him as might a great\nstone god. It gave no sign. After a decent wait, the man howled further\nchallenges, mingling with them wonderful epithets.\n\nPresently there came the spectacle of a man churning himself into\ndeepest rage over the immobility of a house. He fumed at it as the\nwinter wind attacks a prairie cabin in the north. To the distance there\nshould have gone the sound of a tumult like the fighting of two hundred\nMexicans. As necessity bade him, he paused for breath or to reload his\nrevolvers.\n\n\n                   IV\n\nPotter and his bride walked sheepishly and with speed. Sometimes they\nlaughed together shamefacedly and low.\n\n\"Next corner, dear,\" he said finally.\n\nThey put forth the efforts of a pair walking bowed against a strong\nwind. Potter was about to raise a finger to point the first appearance\nof the new home, when, as they circled the corner, they came face to\nface with a man in a maroon-coloured shirt, who was feverishly pushing\ncartridges into a large revolver. Upon the instant the man dropped this\nrevolver to the ground, and, like lightning, whipped another from its\nholster. The second weapon was aimed at the bridegroom's chest.\n\nThere was a silence. Potter's mouth seemed to be merely a grave for his\ntongue. He exhibited an instinct to at once loosen his arm from the\nwoman's grip, and he dropped the bag to the sand. As for the bride, her\nface had gone as yellow as old cloth. She was a slave to hideous rites,\ngazing at the apparitional snake.\n\nThe two men faced each other at a distance of three paces. He of the\nrevolver smiled with a new and quiet ferocity. \"Tried to sneak up on\nme!\" he said. \"Tried to sneak up on me!\" His eyes grew more baleful. As\nPotter made a slight movement, the man thrust his revolver venomously\nforward. \"No; don't you do it, Jack Potter. Don't you move a finger\ntowards a gun just yet. Don't you move an eyelash. The time has come\nfor me to settle with you, and I'm going to do it my own way, and loaf\nalong with no interferin'. So if you don't want a gun bent on you, just\nmind what I tell you.\"\n\nPotter looked at his enemy. \"I ain't got a gun on me, Scratchy,\" he\nsaid. \"Honest, I ain't.\" He was stiffening and steadying, but yet\nsomewhere at the back of his mind a vision of the Pullman floated--the\nsea-green figured velvet, the shining brass, silver, and glass, the\nwood that gleamed as darkly brilliant as the surface of a pool of\noil--all the glory of their marriage, the environment of the new estate.\n\n\"You know I fight when it comes to fighting, Scratchy Wilson, but I\nain't got a gun on me. You'll have to do all the shootin' yourself.\"\n\nHis enemy's face went livid. He stepped forward, and lashed his weapon\nto and fro before Potter's chest.\n\n\"Don't you tell me you ain't got no gun on you, you whelp. Don't tell\nme no lie like that. There ain't a man in Texas ever seen you without\nno gun. Don't take me for no kid.\"\n\nHis eyes blazed with light and his throat worked like a pump.\n\n\"I ain't takin' you for no kid,\" answered Potter. His heels had not\nmoved an inch backward. \"I'm takin' you for a ---- fool. I tell you I\nain't got a gun, and I ain't. If you're goin' to shoot me up, you'd\nbetter begin now. You'll never get a chance like this again.\"\n\nSo much enforced reasoning had told on Wilson's rage. He was calmer.\n\n\"If you ain't got a gun, why ain't you got a gun?\" he sneered. \"Been to\nSunday school?\"\n\n\"I ain't got a gun because I've just come from San Anton' with my wife.\nI'm married,\" said Potter. \"And if I'd thought there was going to be\nany galoots like you prowling around when I brought my wife home, I'd\nhad a gun, and don't you forget it.\"\n\n\"Married!\" said Scratchy, not at all comprehending.\n\n\"Yes, married! I'm married,\" said Potter, distinctly.\n\n\"Married!\" said Scratchy; seeming for the first time he saw the\ndrooping drowning woman at the other man's side. \"No!\" he said. He\nwas like a creature allowed a glimpse of another world. He moved a\npace backward, and his arm with the revolver dropped to his side. \"Is\nthis--is this the lady?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes, this is the lady,\" answered Potter.\n\nThere was another period of silence.\n\n\"Well,\" said Wilson at last, slowly, \"I s'pose it's all off now?\"\n\n\"It's all off if you say so, Scratchy. You know I didn't make the\ntrouble.\"\n\nPotter lifted his valise.\n\n\"Well, I 'low it's off, Jack,\" said Wilson. He was looking at the\nground. \"Married!\" He was not a student of chivalry; it was merely that\nin the presence of this foreign condition he was a simple child of the\nearlier plains. He picked up his starboard revolver, and placing both\nweapons in their holsters, he went away. His feet made funnel-shaped\ntracks in the heavy sand.\n\n\n\n\n            THE WISE MEN\n\n\nThey were youths of subtle mind. They were very wicked according to\nreport, and yet they managed to have it reflect great credit upon them.\nThey often had the well-informed and the great talkers of the American\ncolony engaged in reciting their misdeeds, and facts relating to their\nsins were usually told with a flourish of awe and fine admiration.\n\nOne was from San Francisco and one was from New York, but they\nresembled each other in appearance. This is an idiosyncrasy of\ngeography.\n\nThey were never apart in the City of Mexico, at any rate, excepting\nperhaps when one had retired to his hotel for a respite, and then the\nother was usually camped down at the office sending up servants with\nclamorous messages. \"Oh, get up and come on down.\"\n\nThey were two lads--they were called the kids--and far from their\nmothers. Occasionally some wise man pitied them, but he usually was\nalone in his wisdom. The other folk frankly were transfixed at the\nsplendour of the audacity and endurance of these kids.\n\n\"When do those boys ever sleep?\" murmured a man as he viewed them\nentering a caf\u00c3\u00a9 about eight o'clock one morning. Their smooth infantile\nfaces looked bright and fresh enough, at any rate. \"Jim told me he saw\nthem still at it about 4.30 this morning.\"\n\n\"Sleep!\" ejaculated a companion in a glowing voice. \"They never sleep!\nThey go to bed once in every two weeks.\" His boast of it seemed almost\na personal pride.\n\n\"They'll end with a crash, though, if they keep it up at this pace,\"\nsaid a gloomy voice from behind a newspaper.\n\nThe Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Colorado has a front of white and gold, in which is set\nlarger plate-glass windows than are commonly to be found in Mexico.\nTwo little wings of willow flip-flapping incessantly serve as doors.\nUnder them small stray dogs go furtively into the caf\u00c3\u00a9, and are shied\ninto the street again by the waiters. On the side-walk there is always\na decorative effect of loungers, ranging from the newly-arrived and\nsuperior tourist to the old veteran of the silver mines bronzed by\nviolent suns. They contemplate with various shades of interest the show\nof the street--the red, purple, dusty white, glaring forth against the\nwalls in the furious sunshine.\n\nOne afternoon the kids strolled into the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Colorado. A half-dozen\nof the men who sat smoking and reading with a sort of Parisian effect\nat the little tables which lined two sides of the room, looked up and\nbowed smiling, and although this coming of the kids was anything but an\nunusual event, at least a dozen men wheeled in their chairs to stare\nafter them. Three waiters polished tables, and moved chairs noisily,\nand appeared to be eager. Distinctly these kids were of importance.\n\nBehind the distant bar, the tall form of old Pop himself awaited them\nsmiling with broad geniality. \"Well, my boys, how are you?\" he cried in\na voice of profound solicitude. He allowed five or six of his customers\nto languish in the care of Mexican bartenders, while he himself gave\nhis eloquent attention to the kids, lending all the dignity of a great\nevent to their arrival. \"How are the boys to-day, eh?\"\n\n\"You're a smooth old guy,\" said one, eying him. \"Are you giving us this\nwelcome so we won't notice it when you push your worst whisky at us?\"\n\nPop turned in appeal from one kid to the other kid. \"There, now, hear\nthat, will you?\" He assumed an oratorical pose. \"Why, my boys, you\nalways get the best that this house has got.\"\n\n\"Yes, we do!\" The kids laughed. \"Well, bring it out, anyhow, and if\nit's the same you sold us last night, we'll grab your cash register and\nrun.\"\n\nPop whirled a bottle along the bar and then gazed at it with a rapt\nexpression. \"Fine as silk,\" he murmured. \"Now just taste that, and if\nit isn't the best whisky you ever put in your face, why I'm a liar,\nthat's all.\"\n\nThe kids surveyed him with scorn, and poured their allowances. Then\nthey stood for a time insulting Pop about his whisky. \"Usually it\ntastes exactly like new parlour furniture,\" said the San Francisco\nkid. \"Well, here goes, and you want to look out for your cash\nregister.\"\n\n\"Your health, gentlemen,\" said Pop with a grand air, and as he wiped\nhis bristling grey moustaches he wagged his head with reference to the\ncash register question. \"I could catch you before you got very far.\"\n\n\"Why, are you a runner?\" said one derisively.\n\n\"You just bank on me, my boy,\" said Pop, with deep emphasis. \"I'm a\nflier.\"\n\nThe kids sat down their glasses suddenly and looked at him. \"You must\nbe,\" they said. Pop was tall and graceful and magnificent in manner,\nbut he did not display those qualities of form which mean speed in the\nanimal. His hair was grey; his face was round and fat from much living.\nThe buttons of his glittering white waistcoat formed a fine curve, so\nthat if the concave surface of a piece of barrel-hoop had been laid\nagainst Pop it would have touched every button. \"You must be,\" observed\nthe kids again.\n\n\"Well, you can laugh all you like, but--no jolly now, boys, I tell you\nI'm a winner. Why, I bet you I can skin anything in this town on a\nsquare go. When I kept my place in Eagle Pass there wasn't anybody who\ncould touch me. One of these sure things came down from San Anton'. Oh,\nhe was a runner he was. One of these people with wings. Well, I skinned\n'im. What? Certainly I did. Never touched me.\"\n\nThe kids had been regarding him in grave silence, but at this moment\nthey grinned, and said quite in chorus, \"Oh, you old liar!\"\n\nPop's voice took on a whining tone of earnestness. \"Boys, I'm telling\nit to you straight. I'm a flier.\"\n\nOne of the kids had had a dreamy cloud in his eye and he cried out\nsuddenly--\"Say, what a joke to play this on Freddie.\"\n\nThe other jumped ecstatically. \"Oh, wouldn't it though. Say he wouldn't\ndo a thing but howl! He'd go crazy.\"\n\nThey looked at Pop as if they longed to be certain that he was, after\nall, a runner. \"Now, Pop, on the level,\" said one of them wistfully,\n\"can you run?\"\n\n\"Boys,\" swore Pop, \"I'm a peach! On the dead level, I'm a peach.\"\n\n\"By golly, I believe the old Indian can run,\" said one to the other, as\nif they were alone in confidence.\n\n\"That's what I can,\" cried Pop.\n\nThe kids said--\"Well, so long, old man.\" They went to a table and sat\ndown. They ordered a salad. They were always ordering salads. This was\nbecause one kid had a wild passion for salads, and the other didn't\ncare. So at any hour of the day they might be seen ordering a salad.\nWhen this one came they went into a sort of executive session. It was\na very long consultation. Men noted it. Occasionally the kids laughed\nin supreme enjoyment of something unknown. The low rumble of wheels\ncame from the street. Often could be heard the parrot-like cries of\ndistant vendors. The sunlight streamed through the green curtains, and\nmade little amber-coloured flitterings on the marble floor. High up\namong the severe decorations of the ceiling--reminiscent of the days\nwhen the great building was a palace--a small white butterfly was\nwending through the cool air spaces. The long billiard hall led back\nto a vague gloom. The balls were always clicking, and one could see\ncountless crooked elbows. Beggars slunk through the wicker doors, and\nwere ejected by the nearest waiter. At last the kids called Pop to them.\n\n\"Sit down, Pop. Have a drink.\" They scanned him carefully. \"Say now,\nPop, on your solemn oath, can you run?\"\n\n\"Boys,\" said Pop piously, and raising his hand, \"I can run like a\nrabbit.\"\n\n\"On your oath?\"\n\n\"On my oath.\"\n\n\"Can you beat Freddie?\"\n\nPop appeared to look at the matter from all sides. \"Well, boys,\nI'll tell you. No man is ever cock-sure of anything in this world,\nand I don't want to say that I can best any man, but I've seen\nFreddie run, and I'm ready to swear I can beat him. In a hundred\nyards I'd just about skin 'im neat--you understand, just about neat.\nFreddie is a good average runner, but I--you understand--I'm just--a\nlittle--bit--better.\" The kids had been listening with the utmost\nattention. Pop spoke the latter part slowly and meanfully. They thought\nhe intended them to see his great confidence.\n\nOne said--\"Pop, if you throw us in this thing, we'll come here and\ndrink for two weeks without paying. We'll back you and work a josh on\nFreddie! But O!--if you throw us!\"\n\nTo this menace Pop cried--\"Boys, I'll make the run of my life! On my\noath!\"\n\nThe salad having vanished, the kids arose. \"All right, now,\" they\nwarned him. \"If you play us for duffers, we'll get square. Don't you\nforget it.\"\n\n\"Boys, I'll give you a race for your money. Book on that. I may\nlose--understand, I may lose--no man can help meeting a better man. But\nI think I can skin him, and I'll give you a run for your money, you\nbet.\"\n\n\"All right, then. But, look here,\" they told him, \"you keep your face\nclosed. Nobody gets in on this but us. Understand?\"\n\n\"Not a soul,\" Pop declared. They left him, gesturing a last warning\nfrom the wicker doors.\n\nIn the street they saw Benson, his cane gripped in the middle,\nstrolling through the white-clothed jabbering natives on the shady\nside. They semaphored to him eagerly. He came across cautiously, like a\nman who ventures into dangerous company.\n\n\"We're going to get up a race. Pop and Fred. Pop swears he can skin\n'im. This is a tip. Keep it dark. Say, won't Freddie be hot?\"\n\nBenson looked as if he had been compelled to endure these exhibitions\nof insanity for a century. \"Oh, you fellows are off. Pop can't beat\nFreddie. He's an old bat. Why, it's impossible. Pop can't beat Freddie.\"\n\n\"Can't he? Want to bet he can't?\" said the kids. \"There now, let's\nsee--you're talking so large.\"\n\n\"Well, you----\"\n\n\"Oh, bet. Bet or else close your trap. That's the way.\"\n\n\"How do you know you can pull off the race? Seen Freddie?\"\n\n\"No, but----\"\n\n\"Well, see him then. Can't bet with no race arranged. I'll bet with you\nall right--all right. I'll give you fellows a tip though--you're a pair\nof asses. Pop can't run any faster than a brick school-house.\"\n\nThe kids scowled at him and defiantly said--\"Can't he?\" They left him\nand went to the Casa Verde. Freddie, beautiful in his white jacket, was\nholding one of his innumerable conversations across the bar. He smiled\nwhen he saw them. \"Where you boys been?\" he demanded, in a paternal\ntone. Almost all the proprietors of American caf\u00c3\u00a9s in the city used to\nadopt a paternal tone when they spoke to the kids.\n\n\"Oh, been 'round,'\" they replied.\n\n\"Have a drink?\" said the proprietor of the Casa Verde, forgetting his\nother social obligations. During the course of this ceremony one of the\nkids remarked--\n\n\"Freddie, Pop says he can beat you running.\"\n\n\"Does he?\" observed Freddie without excitement. He was used to various\nsnares of the kids.\n\n\"That's what. He says he can leave you at the wire and not see you\nagain.\"\n\n\"Well, he lies,\" replied Freddie placidly.\n\n\"And I'll bet you a bottle of wine that he can do it, too.\"\n\n\"Rats!\" said Freddie.\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" pursued a kid. \"You can throw bluffs all you\nlike, but he can lose you in a hundred yards' dash, you bet.\"\n\nFreddie drank his whisky, and then settled his elbows on the bar.\n\n\"Say, now, what do you boys keep coming in here with some pipe-story\nall the time for? You can't josh me. Do you think you can scare me\nabout Pop? Why, I know I can beat him. He can't run with me. Certainly\nnot. Why, you fellows are just jollying me.\"\n\n\"Are we though!\" said the kids. \"You daren't bet the bottle of wine.\"\n\n\"Oh, of course I can bet you a bottle of wine,\" said Freddie\ndisdainfully. \"Nobody cares about a bottle of wine, but----\"\n\n\"Well, make it five then,\" advised one of the kids.\n\nFreddie hunched his shoulders. \"Why, certainly I will. Make it ten if\nyou like, but----\"\n\n\"We do,\" they said.\n\n\"Ten, is it? All right; that goes.\" A look of weariness came over\nFreddie's face. \"But you boys are foolish. I tell you Pop is an old\nman. How can you expect him to run? Of course, I'm no great runner, but\nthen I'm young and healthy and--and a pretty smooth runner too. Pop is\nold and fat, and then he doesn't do a thing but tank all day. It's a\ncinch.\"\n\nThe kids looked at him and laughed rapturously. They waved their\nfingers at him. \"Ah, there!\" they cried. They meant that they had made\na victim of him.\n\nBut Freddie continued to expostulate. \"I tell you he couldn't win--an\nold man like him. You're crazy. Of course, I know you don't care about\nten bottles of wine, but, then--to make such bets as that. You're\ntwisted.\"\n\n\"Are we, though?\" cried the kids in mockery. They had precipitated\nFreddie into a long and thoughtful treatise on every possible chance\nof the thing as he saw it. They disputed with him from time to time,\nand jeered at him. He laboured on through his argument. Their childish\nfaces were bright with glee.\n\nIn the midst of it Wilburson entered. Wilburson worked; not too much,\nthough. He had hold of the Mexican end of a great importing house of\nNew York, and as he was a junior partner, he worked. But not too much,\nthough. \"What's the howl?\" he said.\n\nThe kids giggled. \"We've got Freddie rattled.\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Freddie, turning to him, \"these two Indians are trying to\ntell me that Pop can beat me running.\"\n\n\"Like the devil,\" said Wilburson, incredulously.\n\n\"Well, can't he?\" demanded a kid.\n\n\"Why, certainly not,\" said Wilburson, dismissing every possibility of\nit with a gesture. \"That old bat? Certainly not. I'll bet fifty dollars\nthat Freddie----\"\n\n\"Take you,\" said a kid.\n\n\"What?\" said Wilburson, \"that Freddie won't beat Pop?\"\n\nThe kid that had spoken now nodded his head.\n\n\"That Freddie won't beat Pop?\" repeated Wilburson.\n\n\"Yes. It's a go?\"\n\n\"Why, certainly,\" retorted Wilburson. \"Fifty? All right.\"\n\n\"Bet you five bottles on the side,\" ventured the other kid.\n\n\"Why, certainly,\" exploded Wilburson wrathfully. \"You fellows must\ntake me for something easy. I'll take all those kinds of bets I can\nget. Cer--tain--ly.\"\n\nThey settled the details. The course was to be paced off on the asphalt\nof one of the adjacent side-streets, and then, at about eleven o'clock\nin the evening, the match would be run. Usually in Mexico the streets\nof a city grow lonely and dark but a little after nine o'clock. There\nare occasional lurking figures, perhaps, but no crowds, lights and\nnoise. The course would doubtless be undisturbed. As for the policeman\nin the vicinity, they--well, they were conditionally amiable.\n\nThe kids went to see Pop; they told him of the arrangement, and then in\ndeep tones they said, \"Oh, Pop, if you throw us!\"\n\nPop appeared to be a trifle shaken by the weight of responsibility\nthrust upon him, but he spoke out bravely. \"Boys, I'll pinch that race.\nNow you watch me. I'll pinch it.\"\n\nThe kids went then on some business of their own, for they were not\nseen again till evening. When they returned to the neighbourhood of\nthe Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Colorado the usual stream of carriages was whirling along the\ncalle. The wheels hummed on the asphalt, and the coachmen towered in\ntheir great sombreros. On the sidewalk a gazing crowd sauntered, the\nbetter class self-satisfied and proud, in their Derby hats and cut-away\ncoats, the lower classes muffling their dark faces in their blankets,\nslipping along in leather sandals. An electric light sputtered and\nfumed over the throng. The afternoon shower had left the pave wet and\nglittering. The air was still laden with the odour of rain on flowers,\ngrass, leaves.\n\nIn the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Colorado a cosmopolitan crowd ate, drank, played billiards,\ngossiped, or read in the glaring yellow light. When the kids entered a\nlarge circle of men that had been gesticulating near the bar greeted\nthem with a roar.\n\n\"Here they are now!\"\n\n\"Oh, you pair of peaches!\"\n\n\"Say, got any more money to bet with?\" Colonel Hammigan, grinning,\npushed his way to them. \"Say, boys, we'll all have a drink on you now\nbecause you won't have any money after eleven o'clock. You'll be going\ndown the back stairs in your stocking feet.\"\n\nAlthough the kids remained unnaturally serene and quiet, argument in\nthe Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Colorado became tumultuous. Here and there a man who did not\nintend to bet ventured meekly that perchance Pop might win, and the\nothers swarmed upon him in a whirlwind of angry denial and ridicule.\n\nPop, enthroned behind the bar, looked over at this storm with a shadow\nof anxiety upon his face. This widespread flouting affected him, but\nthe kids looked blissfully satisfied with the tumult they had stirred.\n\nBlanco, honest man, ever worrying for his friends, came to them. \"Say,\nyou fellows, you aren't betting too much? This thing looks kind of\nshaky, don't it?\"\n\nThe faces of the kids grew sober, and after consideration one\nsaid--\"No, I guess we've got a good thing, Blanco. Pop is going to\nsurprise them, I think.\"\n\n\"Well, don't----\"\n\n\"All right, old boy. We'll watch out.\"\n\nFrom time to time the kids had much business with certain orange, red,\nblue, purple, and green bills. They were making little memoranda on the\nback of visiting cards. Pop watched them closely, the shadow still upon\nhis face. Once he called to them, and when they came he leaned over the\nbar and said intensely--\"Say, boys, remember, now--I might lose this\nrace. Nobody can ever say for sure, and if I do, why----\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all right, Pop,\" said the kids, reassuringly. \"Don't mind\nit. Do your derndest, and let it go at that.\"\n\nWhen they had left him, however, they went to a corner to consult.\n\"Say, this is getting interesting. Are you in deep?\" asked one\nanxiously of his friend.\n\n\"Yes, pretty deep,\" said the other stolidly. \"Are you?\"\n\n\"Deep as the devil,\" replied the other in the same tone.\n\nThey looked at each other stonily and went back to the crowd. Benson\nhad just entered the caf\u00c3\u00a9. He approached them with a gloating smile of\nvictory. \"Well, where's all that money you were going to bet?\"\n\n\"Right here,\" said the kids, thrusting into their waistcoat pockets.\n\nAt eleven o'clock a curious thing was learned. When Pop and Freddie,\nthe kids and all, came to the little side street, it was thick with\npeople. It seemed that the news of this race had spread like the wind\namong the Americans, and they had come to witness the event. In the\ndarkness the crowd moved, mumbling in argument.\n\nThe principals--the kids and those with them--surveyed this scene with\nsome dismay. \"Say--here's a go.\" Even then a policeman might be seen\napproaching, the light from his little lantern flickering on his white\ncap, gloves, brass buttons, and on the butt of the old-fashioned Colt's\nrevolver which hung at his belt. He addressed Freddie in swift Mexican.\nFreddie listened, nodding from time to time. Finally Freddie turned to\nthe others to translate. \"He says he'll get into trouble if he allows\nthis race when all this crowd is here.\"\n\nThere was a murmur of discontent. The policeman looked at them with an\nexpression of anxiety on his broad, brown face.\n\n\"Oh, come on. We'll go hold it on some other fellow's beat,\" said one\nof the kids. The group moved slowly away debating. Suddenly the other\nkid cried, \"I know! The Paseo!\"\n\n\"By jiminy,\" said Freddie, \"just the thing. We'll get a cab and go out\nto the Paseo. S-s-h! Keep it quiet; we don't want all this mob.\"\n\nLater they tumbled into a cab--Pop, Freddie, the kids, old Colonel\nHammigan and Benson. They whispered to the men who had wagered, \"The\nPaseo.\" The cab whirled away up the black street. There were occasional\ngrunts and groans, cries of \"Oh, get off me feet,\" and of \"Quit! you're\nkilling me.\" Six people do not have fun in one cab. The principals\nspoke to each other with the respect and friendliness which comes to\ngood men at such times. Once a kid put his head out of the window and\nlooked backward. He pulled it in again and cried, \"Great Scott! Look at\nthat, would you!\"\n\nThe others struggled to do as they were bid, and afterwards shouted,\n\"Holy smoke! Well, I'll be blowed! Thunder and turf!\"\n\nGalloping after them came innumerable cabs, their lights twinkling,\nstreaming in a great procession through the night.\n\n\"The street is full of them,\" ejaculated the old colonel.\n\nThe Paseo de la Reforma is the famous drive of the city of Mexico,\nleading to the Castle of Chapultepec, which last ought to be well known\nin the United States.\n\nIt is a fine broad avenue of macadam with a much greater quality of\ndignity than anything of the kind we possess in our own land. It seems\nof the old world, where to the beauty of the thing itself is added the\nsolemnity of tradition and history, the knowledge that feet in buskins\ntrod the same stones, that cavalcades of steel thundered there before\nthe coming of carriages.\n\nWhen the Americans tumbled out of their cabs the giant bronzes of Aztec\nand Spaniard loomed dimly above them like towers. The four roads of\npoplar trees rustled weirdly off there in the darkness. Pop took out\nhis watch and struck a match. \"Well, hurry up this thing. It's almost\nmidnight.\"\n\nThe other cabs came swarming, the drivers lashing their horses, for\nthese Americans, who did all manner of strange things, nevertheless\nalways paid well for it. There was a mighty hubbub then in the\ndarkness. Five or six men began to pace the distance and quarrel.\nOthers knotted their handkerchiefs together to make a tape. Men were\nswearing over bets, fussing and fuming about the odds. Benson came to\nthe kids swaggering. \"You're a pair of asses.\" The cabs waited in a\nsolid block down the avenue. Above the crowd the tall statues hid their\nvisages in the night.\n\nAt last a voice floated through the darkness. \"Are you ready there?\"\nEverybody yelled excitedly. The men at the tape pulled it out straight.\n\"Hold it higher, Jim, you fool,\" and silence fell then upon the throng.\nMen bended down trying to pierce the deep gloom with their eyes. From\nout at the starting point came muffled voices. The crowd swayed and\njostled.\n\nThe racers did not come. The crowd began to fret, its nerves burning.\n\"Oh, hurry up,\" shrilled some one.\n\nThe voice called again--\"Ready there?\" Everybody replied--\"Yes, all\nready. Hurry up!\"\n\nThere was a more muffled discussion at the starting point. In the crowd\na man began to make a proposition. \"I'll bet twenty--\" but the crowd\ninterrupted with a howl. \"Here they come!\" The thickly-packed body of\nmen swung as if the ground had moved. The men at the tape shouldered\nmadly at their fellows, bawling, \"Keep back! Keep back!\"\n\nFrom the distance came the noise of feet pattering furiously. Vague\nforms flashed into view for an instant. A hoarse roar broke from the\ncrowd. Men bended and swayed and fought. The kids back near the tape\nexchanged another stolid look. A white form shone forth. It grew like a\nspectre. Always could be heard the wild patter. A scream broke from the\ncrowd. \"By Gawd, it's Pop! Pop! Pop's ahead!\"\n\nThe old man spun towards the tape like a madman, his chin thrown back,\nhis grey hair flying. His legs moved like oiled machinery. And as he\nshot forward a howl as from forty cages of wild animals went toward the\nimperturbable chieftains in bronze. The crowd flung themselves forward.\n\"Oh, you old Indian! You savage! Did anybody ever see such running?\"\n\n\"Ain't he a peach! Well!\"\n\n\"Where's the kids? H-e-y, kids!\"\n\n\"Look at him, would you? Did you ever think?\" These cries flew in the\nair blended in a vast shout of astonishment and laughter.\n\nFor an instant the whole tragedy was in view. Freddie, desperate, his\nteeth shining, his face contorted, whirling along in deadly effort,\nwas twenty feet behind the tall form of old Pop, who, dressed only\nin his--only in his underclothes--gained with each stride. One grand\ninsane moment, and then Pop had hurled himself against the tape--victor!\n\nFreddie, fallen into the arms of some men, struggled with his breath,\nand at last managed to stammer--\n\n\"Say, can't--can't--that old--old--man run!\"\n\nPop, puffing and heaving, could only gasp--\"Where's my shoes? Who's got\nmy shoes?\"\n\nLater Freddie scrambled panting through the crowd, and held out his\nhand. \"Good man, Pop!\" And then he looked up and down the tall, stout\nform. \"Hell! who would think you could run like that?\"\n\nThe kids were surrounded by a crowd, laughing tempestuously.\n\n\"How did you know he could run?\"\n\n\"Why didn't you give me a line on him?\"\n\n\"Say--great snakes!--you fellows had a nerve to bet on Pop.\"\n\n\"Why, I was cock-sure he couldn't win.\"\n\n\"Oh, you fellows must have seen him run before.\"\n\n\"Who would ever think it?\"\n\nBenson came by, filling the midnight air with curses. They turned to\njibe him.\n\n\"What's the matter, Benson?\"\n\n\"Somebody pinched my handkerchief. I tied it up in that string. Damn\nit.\"\n\nThe kids laughed blithely. \"Why, hello! Benson,\" they said.\n\nThere was a great rush for cabs. Shouting, laughing, wondering, the\ncrowd hustled into their conveyances, and the drivers flogged their\nhorses toward the city again.\n\n\"Won't Freddie be crazy! Say, he'll be guyed about this for years.\"\n\n\"But who would ever think that old tank could run so?\"\n\nOne cab had to wait while Pop and Freddie resumed various parts of\ntheir clothing.\n\nAs they drove home, Freddie said--\"Well, Pop, you beat me.\"\n\nPop said--\"That's all right, old man.\"\n\nThe kids, grinning, said--\"How much did you lose, Benson?\"\n\nBenson said defiantly--\"Oh, not so much. How much did you win?\"\n\n\"Oh, not so much.\"\n\nOld Colonel Hammigan, squeezed down in a corner, had apparently been\nreviewing the event in his mind, for he suddenly remarked, \"Well, I'm\ndamned!\"\n\nThey were late in reaching the Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Colorado, but when they did, the\nbottles were on the bar as thick as pickets on a fence.\n\n\n\n\n          THE FIVE WHITE MICE\n\n\nFreddie was mixing a cock-tail. His hand with the long spoon was\nwhirling swiftly, and the ice in the glass hummed and rattled like a\ncheap watch. Over by the window, a gambler, a millionaire, a railway\nconductor, and the agent of a vast American syndicate were playing\nseven-up. Freddie surveyed them with the ironical glance of a man who\nis mixing a cock-tail.\n\nFrom time to time a swarthy Mexican waiter came with his tray from the\nrooms at the rear, and called his orders across the bar. The sounds\nof the indolent stir of the city, awakening from its siesta, floated\nover the screens which barred the sun and the inquisitive eye. From\nthe far-away kitchen could be heard the roar of the old French _chef_,\ndriving, herding, and abusing his Mexican helpers.\n\nA string of men came suddenly in from the street. They stormed up to\nthe bar. There were impatient shouts. \"Come now, Freddie, don't stand\nthere like a portrait of yourself. Wiggle!\" Drinks of many kinds and\ncolours, amber, green, mahogany, strong and mild, began to swarm\nupon the bar with all the attendants of lemon, sugar, mint and ice.\nFreddie, with Mexican support, worked like a sailor in the provision\nof them, sometimes talking with that scorn for drink and admiration for\nthose who drink which is the attribute of a good bar-keeper.\n\nAt last a man was afflicted with a stroke of dice-shaking. A herculean\ndiscussion was waging, and he was deeply engaged in it, but at the\nsame time he lazily flirted the dice. Occasionally he made great\ncombinations. \"Look at that, would you?\" he cried proudly. The others\npaid little heed. Then violently the craving took them. It went along\nthe line like an epidemic, and involved them all. In a moment they had\narranged a carnival of dice-shaking with money penalties and liquid\nprizes. They clamorously made it a point of honour with Freddie that\nhe should play and take his chance of sometimes providing this large\ngroup with free refreshment. With bended heads like football players,\nthey surged over the tinkling dice, jostling, cheering, and bitterly\narguing. One of the quiet company playing seven-up at the corner table\nsaid profanely that the row reminded him of a bowling contest at a\npicnic.\n\nAfter the regular shower, many carriages rolled over the smooth calle,\nand sent a musical thunder through the Casa Verde. The shop-windows\nbecame aglow with light, and the walks were crowded with youths, callow\nand ogling, dressed vainly according to superstitious fashions. The\npolicemen had muffled themselves in their gnome-like cloaks, and placed\ntheir lanterns as obstacles for the carriages in the middle of the\nstreet. The city of Mexico gave forth the deep organ-mellow tones of\nits evening resurrection.\n\nBut still the group at the bar of the Casa Verde were shaking dice.\nThey had passed beyond shaking for drinks for the crowd, for Mexican\ndollars, for dinners, for the wine at dinner. They had even gone to\nthe trouble of separating the cigars and cigarettes from the dinner's\nbill, and causing a distinct man to be responsible for them. Finally\nthey were aghast. Nothing remained in sight of their minds which\neven remotely suggested further gambling. There was a pause for deep\nconsideration.\n\n\"Well----\"\n\n\"Well----\"\n\nA man called out in the exuberance of creation. \"I know! Let's shake\nfor a box to-night at the circus! A box at the circus!\" The group was\nprofoundly edified. \"That's it! That's it! Come on now! Box at the\ncircus!\" A dominating voice cried--\"Three dashes--high man out!\" An\nAmerican, tall, and with a face of copper red from the rays that flash\namong the Sierra Madres and burn on the cactus deserts, took the little\nleathern cup and spun the dice out upon the polished wood. A fascinated\nassemblage hung upon the bar-rail. Three kings turned their pink faces\nupward. The tall man flourished the cup, burlesquing, and flung the\ntwo other dice. From them he ultimately extracted one more pink king.\n\"There,\" he said. \"Now, let's see! Four kings!\" He began to swagger in\na sort of provisional way.\n\nThe next man took the cup, and blew softly in the top of it. Poising\nit in his hand, he then surveyed the company with a stony eye and\npaused. They knew perfectly well that he was applying the magic of\ndeliberation and ostentatious indifference, but they could not wait in\ntranquillity during the performance of all these rites. They began to\ncall out impatiently. \"Come now--hurry up.\" At last the man, with a\ngesture that was singularly impressive, threw the dice. The others set\nup a howl of joy. \"Not a pair!\" There was another solemn pause. The men\nmoved restlessly. \"Come, now, go ahead!\" In the end, the man, induced\nand abused, achieved something that was nothing in the presence of four\nkings. The tall man climbed on the foot-rail and leaned hazardously\nforward. \"Four kings! My four kings are good to go out,\" he bellowed\ninto the middle of the mob, and although in a moment he did pass into\nthe radiant region of exemption, he continued to bawl advice and scorn.\n\nThe mirrors and oiled woods of the Casa Verde were now dancing with\nblue flashes from a great buzzing electric lamp. A host of quiet\nmembers of the Anglo-Saxon colony had come in for their pre-dinner\ncock-tails. An amiable person was exhibiting to some tourists this\npopular American saloon. It was a very sober and respectable time of\nday. Freddie reproved courageously the dice-shaking brawlers, and, in\nreturn, he received the choicest advice in a tumult of seven combined\nvocabularies. He laughed; he had been compelled to retire from the\ngame, but he was keeping an interested, if furtive, eye upon it.\n\nDown at the end of the line there was a youth at whom everybody railed\nfor his flaming ill-luck. At each disaster, Freddie swore from behind\nthe bar in a sort of affectionate contempt. \"Why, this kid has had no\nluck for two days. Did you ever see such throwin'?\"\n\nThe contest narrowed eventually to the New York kid and an individual\nwho swung about placidly on legs that moved in nefarious circles. He\nhad a grin that resembled a bit of carving. He was obliged to lean\ndown and blink rapidly to ascertain the facts of his venture, but fate\npresented him with five queens. His smile did not change, but he puffed\ngently like a man who has been running.\n\nThe others, having emerged unscathed from this part of the conflict,\nwaxed hilarious with the kid. They smote him on either shoulders.\n\"We've got you stuck for it, kid! You can't beat that game! Five\nqueens!\"\n\nUp to this time the kid had displayed only the temper of the gambler,\nbut the cheerful hoots of the players, supplemented now by a ring of\nguying non-combatants, caused him to feel profoundly that it would be\nfine to beat the five queens. He addressed a gambler's slogan to the\ninterior of the cup.\n\n    \"Oh, five white mice of chance,\n    Shirts of wool and corduroy pants,\n    Gold and wine, women and sin,\n    All for you if you let me come in--\n    Into the house of chance.\"\n\nFlashing the dice sardonically out upon the bar, he displayed three\naces. From two dice in the next throw he achieved one more ace. For\nhis last throw, he rattled the single dice for a long time. He already\nhad four aces; if he accomplished another one, the five queens were\nvanquished and the box at the circus came from the drunken man's\npocket. All the kid's movements were slow and elaborate. For the last\nthrow he planted the cup bottom-down on the bar with the one dice\nhidden under it. Then he turned and faced the crowd with the air of a\nconjuror or a cheat.\n\n\"Oh, maybe it's an ace,\" he said in boastful calm. \"Maybe it's an ace.\"\n\nInstantly he was presiding over a little drama in which every man was\nabsorbed. The kid leaned with his back against the bar-rail and with\nhis elbows upon it.\n\n\"Maybe it's an ace,\" he repeated.\n\nA jeering voice in the background said--\"Yes, maybe it is, kid!\"\n\nThe kid's eyes searched for a moment among the men. \"I'll bet fifty\ndollars it is an ace,\" he said.\n\nAnother voice asked--\"American money?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the kid.\n\n\"Oh!\" There was a genial laugh at this discomfiture. However, no one\ncame forward at the kid's challenge, and presently he turned to the\ncup. \"Now, I'll show you.\" With the manner of a mayor unveiling a\nstatue, he lifted the cup. There was revealed naught but a ten-spot. In\nthe roar which arose could be heard each man ridiculing the cowardice\nof his neighbour, and above all the din rang the voice of Freddie\nbe-rating every one. \"Why, there isn't one liver to every five men in\nthe outfit. That was the greatest cold bluff I ever saw worked. He\nwouldn't know how to cheat with dice if he wanted to. Don't know the\nfirst thing about it. I could hardly keep from laughin' when I seen\nhim drillin' you around. Why, I tell you, I had that fifty dollars\nright in my pocket if I wanted to be a chump. You're an easy lot----\"\n\nNevertheless the group who had won in the theatre-box game did not\nrelinquish their triumph. They burst like a storm about the head of\nthe kid, swinging at him with their fists. \"'Five white mice'!\" they\nquoted, choking. \"'Five white mice'!\"\n\n\"Oh, they are not so bad,\" said the kid.\n\nAfterward it often occurred that a man would jeer a finger at the kid\nand derisively say--\"'Five white mice.'\"\n\nOn the route from the dinner to the circus, others of the party often\nasked the kid if he had really intended to make his appeal to mice.\nThey suggested other animals--rabbits, dogs, hedgehogs, snakes,\nopossums. To this banter the kid replied with a serious expression\nof his belief in the fidelity and wisdom of the five white mice. He\npresented a most eloquent case, decorated with fine language and\ninsults, in which he proved that if one was going to believe in\nanything at all, one might as well choose the five white mice. His\ncompanions, however, at once and unanimously pointed out to him that\nhis recent exploit did not place him in the light of a convincing\nadvocate.\n\nThe kid discerned two figures in the street. They were making imperious\nsigns at him. He waited for them to approach, for he recognized one as\nthe other kid--the Frisco kid: there were two kids. With the Frisco kid\nwas Benson. They arrived almost breathless. \"Where you been?\" cried\nthe Frisco kid. It was an arrangement that upon a meeting the one that\ncould first ask this question was entitled to use a tone of limitless\ninjury. \"What you been doing? Where you going? Come on with us. Benson\nand I have got a little scheme.\"\n\nThe New York kid pulled his arm from the grapple of the other. \"I\ncan't. I've got to take these sutlers to the circus. They stuck me for\nit shaking dice at Freddie's. I can't, I tell you.\"\n\nThe two did not at first attend to his remarks. \"Come on! We've got a\nlittle scheme.\"\n\n\"I can't. They stuck me. I've got to take'm to the circus.\"\n\nAt this time it did not suit the men with the scheme to recognize these\nobjections as important. \"Oh, take'm some other time. Well, can't you\ntake'm some other time? Let 'em go. Damn the circus. Get cold feet.\nWhat did you get stuck for? Get cold feet.\"\n\nBut despite their fighting, the New York kid broke away from them. \"I\ncan't, I tell you. They stuck me.\" As he left them, they yelled with\nrage. \"Well, meet us, now, do you hear? In the Casa Verde as soon as\nthe circus quits! Hear?\" They threw maledictions after him.\n\nIn the city of Mexico, a man goes to the circus without descending in\nany way to infant amusements, because the Circo Teatro Orrin is one\nof the best in the world, and too easily surpasses anything of the\nkind in the United States, where it is merely a matter of a number of\nrings, if possible, and a great professional agreement to lie to the\npublic. Moreover, the American clown, who in the Mexican arena prances\nand gabbles, is the clown to whom writers refer as the delight of their\nchildhood, and lament that he is dead. At this circus the kid was not\ndebased by the sight of mournful prisoner elephants and caged animals\nforlorn and sickly. He sat in his box until late, and laughed and swore\nwhen past laughing at the comic foolish-wise clown.\n\nWhen he returned to the Casa Verde there was no display of the Frisco\nkid and Benson. Freddie was leaning on the bar listening to four men\nterribly discuss a question that was not plain. There was a card-game\nin the corner, of course. Sounds of revelry pealed from the rear rooms.\n\nWhen the kid asked Freddie if he had seen his friend and Benson,\nFreddie looked bored. \"Oh, yes, they were in here just a minute ago,\nbut I don't know where they went. They've got their skates on. Where've\nthey been? Came in here rolling across the floor like two little gilt\ngods. They wobbled around for a time, and then Frisco wanted me to send\nsix bottles of wine around to Benson's rooms, but I didn't have anybody\nto send this time of night, and so they got mad and went out. Where did\nthey get their loads?\"\n\nIn the first deep gloom of the street the kid paused a moment debating.\nBut presently he heard quavering voices. \"Oh, kid! kid! Com'ere!\"\nPeering, he recognized two vague figures against the opposite wall. He\ncrossed the street, and they said--\"Hello-kid.\"\n\n\"Say, where did you get it?\" he demanded sternly. \"You Indians better\ngo home. What did you want to get scragged for?\" His face was luminous\nwith virtue.\n\nAs they swung to and fro, they made angry denials. \"We ain' load'! We\nain' load'. Big chump. Comonangetadrink.\"\n\nThe sober youth turned then to his friend. \"Hadn't you better go home,\nkid? Come on, it's late. You'd better break away.\"\n\nThe Frisco kid wagged his head decisively. \"Got take Benson home first.\nHe'll be wallowing around in a minute. Don't mind me. I'm all right.\"\n\n\"Cerly, he's all right,\" said Benson, arousing from deep thought. \"He's\nall right. But better take'm home, though. That's ri--right. He's\nload'. But he's all right. No need go home any more'n you. But better\ntake'm home. He's load'.\" He looked at his companion with compassion.\n\"Kid, you're load'.\"\n\nThe sober kid spoke abruptly to his friend from San Francisco. \"Kid,\npull yourself together, now. Don't fool. We've got to brace this ass of\na Benson all the way home. Get hold of his other arm.\"\n\nThe Frisco kid immediately obeyed his comrade without a word or a\nglower. He seized Benson and came to attention like a soldier. Later,\nindeed, he meekly ventured--\"Can't we take cab?\" But when the New York\nkid snapped out that there were no convenient cabs he subsided to an\nimpassive silence. He seemed to be reflecting upon his state, without\nastonishment, dismay, or any particular emotion. He submitted himself\nwoodenly to the direction of his friend.\n\nBenson had protested when they had grasped his arms. \"Washa doing?\"\nhe said in a new and guttural voice. \"Washa doing? I ain' load'.\nComonangetadrink. I----\"\n\n\"Oh, come along, you idiot,\" said the New York kid. The Frisco kid\nmerely presented the mien of a stoic to the appeal of Benson, and\nin silence dragged away at one of his arms. Benson's feet came from\nthat particular spot on the pavement with the reluctance of roots and\nalso with the ultimate suddenness of roots. The three of them lurched\nout into the street in the abandon of tumbling chimneys. Benson was\nmeanwhile noisily challenging the others to produce any reasons for his\nbeing taken home. His toes clashed into the kerb when they reached the\nother side of the calle, and for a moment the kids hauled him along\nwith the points of his shoes scraping musically on the pavement. He\nbalked formidably as they were about to pass the Casa Verde. \"No! No!\nLeshavanothdrink! Anothdrink! Onemore!\"\n\nBut the Frisco kid obeyed the voice of his partner in a manner that was\nblind but absolute, and they scummed Benson on past the door. Locked\ntogether the three swung into a dark street. The sober kid's flank was\ncontinually careering ahead of the other wing. He harshly admonished\nthe Frisco child, and the latter promptly improved in the same manner\nof unthinking complete obedience. Benson began to recite the tale of a\nlove affair, a tale that didn't even have a middle. Occasionally the\nNew York kid swore. They toppled on their way like three comedians\nplaying at it on the stage.\n\nAt midnight a little Mexican street burrowing among the walls of the\ncity is as dark as a whale's throat at deep sea. Upon this occasion\nheavy clouds hung over the capital and the sky was a pall. The\nprojecting balconies could make no shadows.\n\n\"Shay,\" said Benson, breaking away from his escort suddenly, \"what\nwant gome for? I ain't load'. You got reg'lar spool-fact'ry in your\nhead--you N' York kid there. Thish oth' kid, he's mos' proper shober,\nmos' proper shober. He's drunk, but--but he's shober.\"\n\n\"Ah, shup up, Benson,\" said the New York kid. \"Come along now. We can't\nstay here all night.\" Benson refused to be corralled, but spread his\nlegs and twirled like a dervish, meanwhile under the evident impression\nthat he was conducting himself most handsomely. It was not long before\nhe gained the opinion that he was laughing at the others. \"Eight purple\ndogsh--dogs! Eight purple dogs. Thas what kid'll see in the morn'. Look\nou' for 'em. They--\"\n\nAs Benson, describing the canine phenomena, swung wildly across the\nsidewalk, it chanced that three other pedestrians were passing in\nshadowy rank. Benson's shoulder jostled one of them.\n\nA Mexican wheeled upon the instant. His hand flashed to his hip. There\nwas a moment of silence, during which Benson's voice was not heard\nraised in apology. Then an indescribable comment, one burning word,\ncame from between the Mexican's teeth.\n\nBenson, rolling about in a semi-detached manner, stared vacantly at\nthe Mexican, who thrust his lean face forward while his fingers played\nnervously at his hip. The New York kid could not follow Spanish well,\nbut he understood when the Mexican breathed softly: \"Does the se\u00c3\u00b1or\nwant to fight?\"\n\nBenson simply gazed in gentle surprise. The woman next to him at\ndinner had said something inventive. His tailor had presented his\nbill. Something had occurred which was mildly out of the ordinary, and\nhis surcharged brain refused to cope with it. He displayed only the\nagitation of a smoker temporarily without a light.\n\nThe New York kid had almost instantly grasped Benson's arm, and was\nabout to jerk him away, when the other kid, who up to this time had\nbeen an automaton, suddenly projected himself forward, thrust the\nrubber Benson aside, and said--\"Yes.\"\n\nThere was no sound nor light in the world. The wall at the left\nhappened to be of the common prison-like construction--no door, no\nwindow, no opening at all. Humanity was enclosed and asleep. Into the\nmouth of the sober kid came a wretched bitter taste as if it had filled\nwith blood. He was transfixed as if he was already seeing the lightning\nripples on the knife-blade.\n\nBut the Mexican's hand did not move at that time. His face went still\nfurther forward and he whispered--\"So?\" The sober kid saw this face\nas if he and it were alone in space--a yellow mask smiling in eager\ncruelty, in satisfaction, and above all it was lit with sinister\ndecision. As for the features, they were reminiscent of an unplaced, a\nforgotten type, which really resembled with precision those of a man\nwho had shaved him three times in Boston in 1888. But the expression\nburned his mind as sealing-wax burns the palm, and fascinated,\nstupefied, he actually watched the progress of the man's thought toward\nthe point where a knife would be wrenched from its sheath. The emotion,\na sort of mechanical fury, a breeze made by electric fans, a rage made\nby vanity, smote the dark countenance in wave after wave.\n\nThen the New York kid took a sudden step forward. His hand was at his\nhip. He was gripping there a revolver of robust size. He recalled that\nupon its black handle was stamped a hunting scene in which a sportsman\nin fine leggings and a peaked cap was taking aim at a stag less than\none-eighth of an inch away.\n\nHis pace forward caused instant movement of the Mexicans. One\nimmediately took two steps to face him squarely. There was a general\nadjustment, pair and pair. This opponent of the New York kid was a\ntall man and quite stout. His sombrero was drawn low over his eyes.\nHis serape was flung on his left shoulder. His back was bended in the\nsupposed manner of a Spanish grandee. This concave gentleman cut a fine\nand terrible figure. The lad, moved by the spirits of his modest and\nperpendicular ancestors, had time to feel his blood roar at sight of\nthe pose.\n\nHe was aware that the third Mexican was over on the left fronting\nBenson, and he was aware that Benson was leaning against the wall\nsleepily and peacefully eying the convention. So it happened that\nthese six men stood, side fronting side, five of them with their right\nhands at their hips and with their bodies lifted nervously, while the\ncentral pair exchanged a crescendo of provocations. The meaning of\ntheir words rose and rose. They were travelling in a straight line\ntoward collision.\n\nThe New York kid contemplated his Spanish grandee. He drew his revolver\nupward until the hammer was surely free of the holster. He waited\nimmovable and watchful while the garrulous Frisco kid expended two and\na half lexicons on the middle Mexican.\n\nThe eastern lad suddenly decided that he was going to be killed. His\nmind leaped forward and studied the aftermath. The story would be a\nmarvel of brevity when first it reached the far New York home, written\nin a careful hand on a bit of cheap paper, topped and footed and\nbacked by the printed fortifications of the cable company. But they\nare often as stones flung into mirrors, these bits of paper upon which\nare laconically written all the most terrible chronicles of the times.\nHe witnessed the uprising of his mother and sister, and the invincible\ncalm of his hard-mouthed old father, who would probably shut himself\nin his library and smoke alone. Then his father would come, and they\nwould bring him here and say--\"This is the place.\" Then, very likely,\neach would remove his hat. They would stand quietly with their hats in\ntheir hands for a decent minute. He pitied his old financing father,\nunyielding and millioned, a man who commonly spoke twenty-two words a\nyear to his beloved son. The kid understood it at this time. If his\nfate was not impregnable, he might have turned out to be a man and have\nbeen liked by his father.\n\nThe other kid would mourn his death. He would be preternaturally\ncorrect for some weeks, and recite the tale without swearing. But it\nwould not bore him. For the sake of his dead comrade he would be glad\nto be preternaturally correct, and to recite the tale without swearing.\n\nThese views were perfectly stereopticon, flashing in and away from his\nthought with an inconceivable rapidity until after all they were simply\none quick dismal impression. And now here is the unreal real: into this\nkid's nostrils, at the expectant moment of slaughter, had come the\nscent of new-mown hay, a fragrance from a field of prostrate grass, a\nfragrance which contained the sunshine, the bees, the peace of meadows,\nand the wonder of a distant crooning stream. It had no right to be\nsupreme, but it was supreme, and he breathed it as he waited for pain\nand a sight of the unknown.\n\nBut in the same instant, it may be, his thought flew to the Frisco kid,\nand it came upon him like a flicker of lightning that the Frisco kid\nwas not going to be there to perform, for instance, the extraordinary\noffice of respectable mourner. The other kid's head was muddled, his\nhand was unsteady, his agility was gone. This other kid was facing the\ndetermined and most ferocious gentleman of the enemy. The New York kid\nbecame convinced that his friend was lost. There was going to be a\nscreaming murder. He was so certain of it that he wanted to shield his\neyes from sight of the leaping arm and the knife. It was sickening,\nutterly sickening. The New York kid might have been taking his first\nsea-voyage. A combination of honourable manhood and inability prevented\nhim from running away.\n\nHe suddenly knew that it was possible to draw his own revolver, and\nby a swift manoeuvre face down all three Mexicans. If he was quick\nenough he would probably be victor. If any hitch occurred in the draw\nhe would undoubtedly be dead with his friends. It was a new game; he\nhad never been obliged to face a situation of this kind in the Beacon\nClub in New York. In this test, the lungs of the kid still continued to\nperform their duty.\n\n    \"Oh, five white mice of chance,\n    Shirts of wool and corduroy pants,\n    Gold and wine, women and sin,\n    All for you if you let me come in--\n    Into the house of chance.\"\n\nHe thought of the weight and size of his revolver, and dismay\npierced him. He feared that in his hands it would be as unwieldy as\na sewing-machine for this quick work. He imagined, too, that some\nsingular providence might cause him to lose his grip as he raised his\nweapon. Or it might get fatally entangled in the tails of his coat.\nSome of the eels of despair lay wet and cold against his back.\n\nBut at the supreme moment the revolver came forth as if it were greased\nand it arose like a feather. This somnolent machine, after months of\nrepose, was finally looking at the breasts of men.\n\nPerhaps in this one series of movements, the kid had unconsciously\nused nervous force sufficient to raise a bale of hay. Before he\ncomprehended it he was standing behind his revolver glaring over the\nbarrel at the Mexicans, menacing first one and then another. His finger\nwas tremoring on the trigger. The revolver gleamed in the darkness with\na fine silver light.\n\nThe fulsome grandee sprang backward with a low cry. The man who had\nbeen facing the Frisco kid took a quick step away. The beautiful array\nof Mexicans was suddenly disorganized.\n\nThe cry and the backward steps revealed something of great importance\nto the New York kid. He had never dreamed that he did not have a\ncomplete monopoly of all possible trepidations. The cry of the grandee\nwas that of a man who suddenly sees a poisonous snake. Thus the kid\nwas able to understand swiftly that they were all human beings. They\nwere unanimous in not wishing for too bloody combat. There was a sudden\nexpression of the equality. He had vaguely believed that they were not\ngoing to evince much consideration for his dramatic development as an\nactive factor. They even might be exasperated into an onslaught by\nit. Instead, they had respected his movement with a respect as great\neven as an ejaculation of fear and backward steps. Upon the instant he\npounced forward and began to swear, unreeling great English oaths as\nthick as ropes, and lashing the faces of the Mexicans with them. He\nwas bursting with rage, because these men had not previously confided\nto him that they were vulnerable. The whole thing had been an absurd\nimposition. He had been seduced into respectful alarm by the concave\nattitude of the grandee. And after all there had been an equality of\nemotion, an equality: he was furious. He wanted to take the serape of\nthe grandee and swaddle him in it.\n\nThe Mexicans slunk back, their eyes burning wistfully. The kid took aim\nfirst at one and then at another. After they had achieved a certain\ndistance they paused and drew up in a rank. They then resumed some of\ntheir old splendour of manner. A voice hailed him in a tone of cynical\nbravado as if it had come from between lips of smiling mockery. \"Well,\nse\u00c3\u00b1or, it is finished?\"\n\nThe kid scowled into the darkness, his revolver drooping at his side.\nAfter a moment he answered--\"I am willing.\" He found it strange that he\nshould be able to speak after this silence of years.\n\n\"Good-night, se\u00c3\u00b1or.\"\n\n\"Good-night.\"\n\nWhen he turned to look at the Frisco kid he found him in his original\nposition, his hand upon his hip. He was blinking in perplexity at the\npoint from whence the Mexicans had vanished.\n\n\"Well,\" said the sober kid crossly, \"are you ready to go home now?\"\n\nThe Frisco kid said--\"Where they gone?\" His voice was undisturbed but\ninquisitive.\n\nBenson suddenly propelled himself from his dreamful position against\nthe wall. \"Frishco kid's all right. He's drunk's fool and he's all\nright. But you New York kid, you're shober.\" He passed into a state of\nprofound investigation. \"Kid shober 'cause didn't go with us. Didn't\ngo with us 'cause went to damn circus. Went to damn circus 'cause lose\nshakin' dice. Lose shakin' dice 'cause--what make lose shakin' dice,\nkid?\"\n\nThe New York kid eyed the senile youth. \"I don't know. The five white\nmice, maybe.\"\n\nBenson puzzled so over this reply that he had to be held erect by his\nfriends. Finally the Frisco kid said--\"Let's go home.\"\n\nNothing had happened.\n\n\n\n\n    FLANAGAN AND HIS SHORT FILIBUSTERING ADVENTURE\n\n\n                   I\n\n\"I have got twenty men at me back who will fight to the death,\" said\nthe warrior to the old filibuster.\n\n\"And they can be blowed for all me,\" replied the old filibuster.\n\"Common as sparrows. Cheap as cigarettes. Show me twenty men with steel\nclamps on their mouths, with holes in their heads where memory ought to\nbe, and I want 'em. But twenty brave men merely? I'd rather have twenty\nbrave onions.\"\n\nThereupon the warrior removed sadly, feeling that no salaams were paid\nto valour in these days of mechanical excellence.\n\nValour, in truth, is no bad thing to have when filibustering; but many\nmedals are to be won by the man who knows not the meaning of \"pow-wow,\"\nbefore or afterwards. Twenty brave men with tongues hung lightly may\nmake trouble rise from the ground like smoke from grass, because of\ntheir subsequent fiery pride; whereas twenty cow-eyed villains who\naccept unrighteous and far-compelling kicks as they do the rain from\nheaven may halo the ultimate history of an expedition with gold, and\nplentifully bedeck their names, winning forty years of gratitude from\npatriots, simply by remaining silent. As for the cause, it may be only\nthat they have no friends or other credulous furniture.\n\nIf it were not for the curse of the swinging tongue, it is surely to\nbe said that the filibustering industry, flourishing now in the United\nStates, would be pie. Under correct conditions, it is merely a matter\nof dealing with some little detectives whose skill at search is rated\nby those who pay them at a value of twelve or twenty dollars each week.\nIt is nearly axiomatic that normally a twelve dollar per week detective\ncannot defeat a one hundred thousand dollar filibustering excursion.\nAgainst the criminal, the detective represents the commonwealth, but in\nthis other case he represents his desire to show cause why his salary\nshould be paid. He represents himself merely, and he counts no more\nthan a grocer's clerk.\n\nBut the pride of the successful filibuster often smites him and his\ncause like an axe, and men who have not confided in their mothers go\nprone with him. It can make the dome of the Capitol tremble and incite\nthe Senators to over-turning benches. It can increase the salaries of\ndetectives who could not detect the location of a pain in the chest. It\nis a wonderful thing, this pride.\n\nFilibustering was once such a simple game. It was managed blandly by\ngentle captains and smooth and undisturbed gentlemen, who at other\ntimes dealt in law, soap, medicine, and bananas. It was a great pity\nthat the little cote of doves in Washington were obliged to rustle\nofficially, and naval men were kept from their berths at night, and\nsundry Custom House people got wiggings, all because the returned\nadventurer pow-wowed in his pride. A yellow and red banner would\nhave been long since smothered in a shame of defeat if a contract to\nfilibuster had been let to some admirable organization like one of our\ntrusts.\n\nAnd yet the game is not obsolete. It is still played by the wise and\nthe silent men whose names are not display-typed and blathered from one\nend of the country to the other.\n\nThere is in mind now a man who knew one side of a fence from the other\nside when he looked sharply. They were hunting for captains then to\ncommand the first vessels of what has since become a famous little\nfleet. One was recommended to this man, and he said, \"Send him down to\nmy office and I'll look him over.\" He was an attorney, and he liked to\nlean back in his chair, twirl a paper-knife, and let the other fellow\ntalk.\n\nThe sea-faring man came and stood and appeared confounded. The attorney\nasked the terrible first question of the filibuster to the applicant.\nHe said, \"Why do you want to go?\"\n\nThe captain reflected, changed his attitude three times, and decided\nultimately that he didn't know. He seemed greatly ashamed. The\nattorney, looking at him, saw that he had eyes that resembled a\nlambkin's eyes.\n\n\"Glory?\" said the attorney at last.\n\n\"No-o,\" said the captain.\n\n\"Pay?\"\n\n\"No-o. Not that so much.\"\n\n\"Think they'll give you a land grant when they win out?\"\n\n\"No; never thought.\"\n\n\"No glory; no immense pay; no land grant. What are you going for, then?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't know,\" said the captain, with his glance on the floor\nand shifting his position again. \"I don't know. I guess it's just for\nfun mostly.\" The attorney asked him out to have a drink.\n\nWhen he stood on the bridge of his out-going steamer, the attorney\nsaw him again. His shore meekness and uncertainty were gone. He was\nclear-eyed and strong, aroused like a mastiff at night. He took his\ncigar out of his mouth and yelled some sudden language at the deck.\n\nThis steamer had about her a quality of unholy medi\u00c3\u00a6val disrepair,\nwhich is usually accounted the principal prerogative of the United\nStates Revenue Marine. There is many a seaworthy ice-house if she were\na good ship. She swashed through the seas as genially as an old wooden\nclock, burying her head under waves that came only like children at\nplay, and, on board, it cost a ducking to go from anywhere to anywhere.\n\nThe captain had commanded vessels that shore-people thought were\nliners; but when a man gets the ant of desire-to-see-what-it's-like\nstirring in his heart, he will wallow out to sea in a pail. The thing\nsurpasses a man's love for his sweetheart. The great tank-steamer\n_Thunder-Voice_ had long been Flanagan's sweetheart, but he was far\nhappier off Hatteras watching this wretched little portmanteau boom\ndown the slant of a wave.\n\nThe crew scraped acquaintance one with another gradually. Each man came\nultimately to ask his neighbour what particular turn of ill-fortune\nor inherited deviltry caused him to try this voyage. When one frank,\nbold man saw another frank, bold man aboard, he smiled, and they became\nfriends. There was not a mind on board the ship that was not fastened\nto the dangers of the coast of Cuba, and taking wonder at this prospect\nand delight in it. Still, in jovial moments they termed each other\naccursed idiots.\n\nAt first there was some trouble in the engine-room, where there were\nmany steel animals, for the most part painted red and in other places\nvery shiny--bewildering, complex, incomprehensible to any one who don't\ncare, usually thumping, thumping, thumping with the monotony of a snore.\n\nIt seems that this engine was as whimsical as a gas-meter. The chief\nengineer was a fine old fellow with a grey moustache, but the engine\ntold him that it didn't intend to budge until it felt better. He came\nto the bridge and said, \"The blamed old thing has laid down on us, sir.\"\n\n\"Who was on duty?\" roared the captain.\n\n\"The second, sir.\"\n\n\"Why didn't he call you?\"\n\n\"Don't know, sir.\" Later the stokers had occasion to thank the stars\nthat they were not second engineers.\n\nThe _Foundling_ was soundly thrashed by the waves for loitering while\nthe captain and the engineers fought the obstinate machinery. During\nthis wait on the sea, the first gloom came to the faces of the company.\nThe ocean is wide, and a ship is a small place for the feet, and an\nill ship is worriment. Even when she was again under way, the gloom\nwas still upon the crew. From time to time men went to the engine-room\ndoors, and looking down, wanted to ask questions of the chief engineer,\nwho slowly prowled to and fro, and watched with careful eye his\nred-painted mysteries. No man wished to have a companion know that he\nwas anxious, and so questions were caught at the lips. Perhaps none\ncommented save the first mate, who remarked to the captain, \"Wonder\nwhat the bally old thing will do, sir, when we're chased by a Spanish\ncruiser?\"\n\nThe captain merely grinned. Later he looked over the side and said to\nhimself with scorn, \"Sixteen knots! sixteen knots! Sixteen hinges on\nthe inner gates of Hades! Sixteen knots! Seven is her gait, and nine if\nyou crack her up to it.\"\n\nThere may never be a captain whose crew can't sniff his misgivings.\nThey scent it as a herd scents the menace far through the trees\nand over the ridges. A captain that does not know that he is on a\nfoundering ship sometimes can take his men to tea and buttered toast\ntwelve minutes before the disaster, but let him fret for a moment in\nthe loneliness of his cabin, and in no time it affects the liver of\na distant and sensitive seaman. Even as Flanagan reflected on the\n_Foundling_, viewing her as a filibuster, word arrived that a winter\nof discontent had come to the stoke-room.\n\nThe captain knew that it requires sky to give a man courage. He sent\nfor a stoker and talked to him on the bridge. The man, standing under\nthe sky, instantly and shamefacedly denied all knowledge of the\nbusiness; nevertheless, a jaw had presently to be broken by a fist\nbecause the _Foundling_ could only steam nine knots, and because the\nstoke-room has no sky, no wind, no bright horizon.\n\nWhen the _Foundling_ was somewhere off Savannah a blow came from the\nnorth-east, and the steamer, headed south-east, rolled like a boiling\npotato. The first mate was a fine officer, and so a wave crashed him\ninto the deck-house and broke his arm. The cook was a good cook, and so\nthe heave of the ship flung him heels over head with a pot of boiling\nwater, and caused him to lose interest in everything save his legs. \"By\nthe piper,\" said Flanagan to himself, \"this filibustering is no trick\nwith cards.\"\n\nLater there was more trouble in the stoke-room. All the stokers\nparticipated save the one with a broken jaw, who had become\ndiscouraged. The captain had an excellent chest development. When he\nwent aft, roaring, it was plain that a man could beat carpets with a\nvoice like that one.\n\n\n                   II\n\nOne night the _Foundling_ was off the southern coast of Florida, and\nrunning at half-speed towards the shore. The captain was on the\nbridge. \"Four flashes at intervals of one minute,\" he said to himself,\ngazing steadfastly towards the beach. Suddenly a yellow eye opened in\nthe black face of the night, and looked at the _Foundling_ and closed\nagain. The captain studied his watch and the shore. Three times more\nthe eye opened and looked at the _Foundling_ and closed again. The\ncaptain called to the vague figures on the deck below him. \"Answer it.\"\nThe flash of a light from the bow of the steamer displayed for a moment\nin golden colour the crests of the inriding waves.\n\nThe _Foundling_ lay to and waited. The long swells rolled her\ngracefully, and her two stub masts reaching into the darkness swung\nwith the solemnity of batons timing a dirge. When the ship had left\nBoston she had been as encrusted with ice as a Dakota stage-driver's\nbeard, but now the gentle wind of Florida softly swayed the lock on\nthe forehead of the coatless Flanagan, and he lit a new cigar without\ntroubling to make a shield of his hands.\n\nFinally a dark boat came plashing over the waves. As it came very near,\nthe captain leaned forward and perceived that the men in her rowed like\nseamstresses, and at the same time a voice hailed him in bad English.\n\"It's a dead sure connection,\" said he to himself.\n\nAt sea, to load two hundred thousand rounds of rifle ammunition, seven\nhundred and fifty rifles, two rapid-fire field guns with a hundred\nshells, forty bundles of machetes, and a hundred pounds of dynamite,\nfrom yawls, and by men who are not born stevedores, and in a heavy\nground swell, and with the searchlight of a United States cruiser\nsometimes flashing like lightning in the sky to the southward, is no\nbusiness for a Sunday-school class. When at last the _Foundling_ was\nsteaming for the open over the grey sea at dawn, there was not a man of\nthe forty come aboard from the Florida shore, nor of the fifteen sailed\nfrom Boston, who was not glad, standing with his hair matted to his\nforehead with sweat, smiling at the broad wake of the _Foundling_ and\nthe dim streak on the horizon which was Florida.\n\nBut there is a point of the compass in these waters men call the\nnorth-east. When the strong winds come from that direction they kick\nup a turmoil that is not good for a _Foundling_ stuffed with coals\nand war-stores. In the gale which came, this ship was no more than a\ndrunken soldier.\n\nThe Cuban leader, standing on the bridge with the captain, was\npresently informed that of his men, thirty-nine out of a possible\nthirty-nine were sea-sick. And in truth they were sea-sick. There\nare degrees in this complaint, but that matter was waived between\nthem. They were all sick to the limits. They strewed the deck in\nevery posture of human anguish, and when the _Foundling_ ducked and\nwater came sluicing down from the bows, they let it sluice. They were\nsatisfied if they could keep their heads clear of the wash; and if\nthey could not keep their heads clear of the wash, they didn't care.\nPresently the _Foundling_ swung her course to the south-east, and the\nwaves pounded her broadside. The patriots were all ordered below decks,\nand there they howled and measured their misery one against another.\nAll day the _Foundling_ plopped and floundered over a blazing bright\nmeadow of an ocean whereon the white foam was like flowers.\n\nThe captain on the bridge mused and studied the bare horizon. \"Hell!\"\nsaid he to himself, and the word was more in amazement than in\nindignation or sorrow. \"Thirty-nine sea-sick passengers, the mate with\na broken arm, a stoker with a broken jaw, the cook with a pair of\nscalded legs, and an engine likely to be taken with all these diseases,\nif not more! If I get back to a home port with a spoke of the wheel\ngripped in my hands, it'll be fair luck!\"\n\nThere is a kind of corn-whisky bred in Florida which the natives\ndeclare is potent in the proportion of seven fights to a drink. Some of\nthe Cuban volunteers had had the forethought to bring a small quantity\nof this whisky aboard with them, and being now in the fire-room and\nsea-sick, feeling that they would not care to drink liquor for two or\nthree years to come, they gracefully tendered their portions to the\nstokers. The stokers accepted these gifts without avidity, but with a\ncertain earnestness of manner.\n\nAs they were stokers, and toiling, the whirl of emotion was delayed,\nbut it arrived ultimately, and with emphasis. One stoker called another\nstoker a weird name, and the latter, righteously inflamed at it, smote\nhis mate with an iron shovel, and the man fell headlong over a heap of\ncoal, which crashed gently while piece after piece rattled down upon\nthe deck.\n\nA third stoker was providently enraged at the scene, and assailed the\nsecond stoker. They fought for some moments, while the sea-sick Cubans\nsprawled on the deck watched with languid rolling glances the ferocity\nof this scuffle. One was so indifferent to the strategic importance of\nthe space he occupied that he was kicked on the shins.\n\nWhen the second engineer came to separating the combatants, he was\nsincere in his efforts, and he came near to disabling them for life.\n\nThe captain said, \"I'll go down there and----\" But the leader of the\nCubans restrained him. \"No, no,\" he cried, \"you must not. We must treat\nthem like children, very gently, all the time, you see, or else when we\nget back to a United States port they will--what you call? Spring? Yes,\nspring the whole business. We must--jolly them, you see?\"\n\n\"You mean,\" said the captain thoughtfully, \"they are likely to get mad,\nand give the expedition dead away when we reach port again unless we\nblarney them now?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" cried the Cuban leader, \"unless we are so very gentle with\nthem they will make many troubles afterwards for us in the newspapers\nand then in court.\"\n\n\"Well, but I won't have my crew----\" began the captain.\n\n\"But you must,\" interrupted the Cuban, \"you must. It is the only thing.\nYou are like the captain of a pirate ship. You see? Only you can't\nthrow them overboard like him. You see?\"\n\n\"Hum,\" said the captain, \"this here filibustering business has got a\nlot to it when you come to look it over.\"\n\nHe called the fighting stokers to the bridge, and the three came, meek\nand considerably battered. He was lecturing them soundly but sensibly,\nwhen he suddenly tripped a sentence and cried--\"Here! Where's that\nother fellow? How does it come he wasn't in the fight?\"\n\nThe row of stokers cried at once eagerly, \"He's hurt, sir. He's got a\nbroken jaw, sir.\"\n\n\"So he has; so he has,\" murmured the captain, much embarrassed.\n\nAnd because of all these affairs, the _Foundling_ steamed toward Cuba\nwith its crew in a sling, if one may be allowed to speak in that way.\n\n\n                   III\n\nAt night the _Foundling_ approached the coast like a thief. Her\nlights were muffled, so that from the deck the sea shone with its own\nradiance, like the faint shimmer of some kinds of silk. The men on deck\nspoke in whispers, and even down in the fire-room the hidden stokers\nworking before the blood-red furnace doors used no words and walked on\ntip-toe. The stars were out in the blue-velvet sky, and their light\nwith the soft shine of the sea caused the coast to appear black as the\nside of a coffin. The surf boomed in low thunder on the distant beach.\n\nThe _Foundling's_ engines ceased their thumping for a time. She glided\nquietly forward until a bell chimed faintly in the engine-room. Then\nshe paused with a flourish of phosphorescent waters.\n\n\"Give the signal,\" said the captain. Three times a flash of light went\nfrom the bow. There was a moment of waiting. Then an eye like the one\non the coast of Florida opened and closed, opened and closed, opened\nand closed. The Cubans, grouped in a great shadow on deck, burst into a\nlow chatter of delight. A hiss from their leader silenced them.\n\n\"Well?\" said the captain.\n\n\"All right,\" said the leader.\n\nAt the giving of the word it was not apparent that any one on board\nof the _Foundling_ had ever been sea-sick. The boats were lowered\nswiftly--too swiftly. Boxes of cartridges were dragged from the hold\nand passed over the side with a rapidity that made men in the boats\nexclaim against it. They were being bombarded. When a boat headed for\nshore its rowers pulled like madmen. The captain paced slowly to and\nfro on the bridge. In the engine-room the engineers stood at their\nstation, and in the stoke-hold the firemen fidgeted silently around the\nfurnace doors.\n\nOn the bridge Flanagan reflected. \"Oh, I don't know!\" he observed.\n\"This filibustering business isn't so bad. Pretty soon it'll be off to\nsea again with nothing to do but some big lying when I get into port.\"\n\nIn one of the boats returning from shore came twelve Cuban officers,\nthe greater number of them convalescing from wounds, while two or three\nof them had been ordered to America on commissions from the insurgents.\nThe captain welcomed them, and assured them of a speedy and safe voyage.\n\nPresently he went again to the bridge and scanned the horizon. The sea\nwas lonely like the spaces amid the suns. The captain grinned and\nsoftly smote his chest. \"It's dead easy,\" he said.\n\nIt was near the end of the cargo, and the men were breathing like spent\nhorses, although their elation grew with each moment, when suddenly a\nvoice spoke from the sky. It was not a loud voice, but the quality of\nit brought every man on deck to full stop and motionless, as if they\nhad all been changed to wax. \"Captain,\" said the man at the masthead,\n\"there's a light to the west'ard, sir. Think it's a steamer, sir.\"\n\nThere was a still moment until the captain called, \"Well, keep your\neye on it now.\" Speaking to the deck, he said, \"Go ahead with your\nunloading.\"\n\nThe second engineer went to the galley to borrow a tin cup. \"Hear the\nnews, second?\" asked the cook. \"Steamer coming up from the west'ard.\"\n\n\"Gee!\" said the second engineer. In the engine-room he said to the\nchief, \"Steamer coming up from the west'ard, sir.\" The chief engineer\nbegan to test various little machines with which his domain was\ndecorated. Finally he addressed the stoke-room. \"Boys, I want you to\nlook sharp now. There's a steamer coming up to the west'ard.\"\n\n\"All right, sir,\" said the stoke-room.\n\nFrom time to time the captain hailed the masthead. \"How is she now?\"\n\n\"Seems to be coming down on us pretty fast, sir.\"\n\nThe Cuban leader came anxiously to the captain. \"Do you think we can\nsave all the cargo? It is rather delicate business. No?\"\n\n\"Go ahead,\" said Flanagan. \"Fire away! I'll wait.\"\n\nThere continued the hurried shuffling of feet on deck, and the low\ncries of the men unloading the cargo. In the engine-room the chief and\nhis assistant were staring at the gong. In the stoke-room the firemen\nbreathed through their teeth. A shovel slipped from where it leaned\nagainst the side and banged on the floor. The stokers started and\nlooked around quickly.\n\nClimbing to the rail and holding on to a stay, the captain gazed\nwestward. A light had raised out of the deep. After watching this light\nfor a time he called to the Cuban leader. \"Well, as soon as you're\nready now, we might as well be skipping out.\"\n\nFinally, the Cuban leader told him, \"Well, this is the last load. As\nsoon as the boats come back you can be off.\"\n\n\"Shan't wait for all the boats,\" said the captain. \"That fellow is too\nclose.\" As the second boat came aboard, the _Foundling_ turned, and\nlike a black shadow stole seaward to cross the bows of the oncoming\nsteamer. \"Waited about ten minutes too long,\" said the captain to\nhimself.\n\nSuddenly the light in the west vanished. \"Hum!\" said Flanagan, \"he's\nup to some meanness.\" Every one outside of the engine-rooms was set\non watch. The _Foundling_, going at full speed into the north-east,\nslashed a wonderful trail of blue silver on the dark bosom of the sea.\n\nA man on deck cried out hurriedly, \"There she is, sir.\" Many eyes\nsearched the western gloom, and one after another the glances of the\nmen found a tiny shadow on the deep with a line of white beneath it.\n\"He couldn't be heading better if he had a line to us,\" said Flanagan.\n\nThere was a thin flash of red in the darkness. It was long and keen\nlike a crimson rapier. A short, sharp report sounded, and then a shot\nwhined swiftly in the air and blipped into the sea. The captain had\nbeen about to take a bite of plug tobacco at the beginning of this\nincident, and his arm was raised. He remained like a frozen figure\nwhile the shot whined, and then, as it blipped into the sea, his hand\nwent to his mouth and he bit the plug. He looked wide-eyed at the\nshadow with its line of white.\n\nThe senior Cuban officer came hurriedly to the bridge. \"It is no good\nto surrender,\" he cried. \"They would only shoot or hang all of us.\"\n\nThere was another thin red flash and a report. A loud whirring noise\npassed over the ship.\n\n\"I'm not going to surrender,\" said the captain, hanging with both hands\nto the rail. He appeared like a man whose traditions of peace are\nclinched in his heart. He was as astonished as if his hat had turned\ninto a dog. Presently he wheeled quickly and said--\"What kind of a gun\nis that?\"\n\n\"It is a one-pounder,\" cried the Cuban officer. \"The boat is one of\nthose little gunboats made from a yacht. You see?\"\n\n\"Well, if it's only a yawl, he'll sink us in five more minutes,\" said\nFlanagan. For a moment he looked helplessly off at the horizon. His\nunder-jaw hung low. But a moment later, something touched him, like\na stiletto point of inspiration. He leaped to the pilothouse and\nroared at the man at the wheel. The _Foundling_ sheered suddenly to\nstarboard, made a clumsy turn, and Flanagan was bellowing through the\ntube to the engine-room before everybody discovered that the old basket\nwas heading straight for the Spanish gun-boat. The ship lunged forward\nlike a draught-horse on the gallop.\n\nThis strange manoeuvre by the _Foundling_ first dealt consternation\non board of the _Foundling_. Men instinctively crouched on the instant,\nand then swore their supreme oath, which was unheard by their own ears.\n\nLater the manoeuvre of the _Foundling_ dealt consternation on board\nof the gunboat. She had been going victoriously forward dim-eyed from\nthe fury of her pursuit. Then this tall threatening shape had suddenly\nloomed over her like a giant apparition.\n\nThe people on board the _Foundling_ heard panic shouts, hoarse orders.\nThe little gunboat was paralyzed with astonishment.\n\nSuddenly Flanagan yelled with rage and sprang for the wheel. The\nhelmsman had turned his eyes away. As the captain whirled the wheel far\nto starboard he heard a crunch as the _Foundling_, lifted on a wave,\nsmashed her shoulder against the gunboat, and he saw shooting past a\nlittle launch sort of a thing with men on her that ran this way and\nthat way. The Cuban officers, joined by the cook and a seaman, emptied\ntheir revolvers into the surprised terror of the seas.\n\nThere was naturally no pursuit. Under comfortable speed the _Foundling_\nstood to the northwards.\n\nThe captain went to his berth chuckling. \"There, by God!\" he said.\n\"There now!\"\n\n\n                   IV\n\nWhen Flanagan came again on deck, the first mate, his arm in a sling,\nwalked the bridge. Flanagan was smiling a wide smile. The bridge of\nthe _Foundling_ was dipping afar and then afar. With each lunge of the\nlittle steamer the water seethed and boomed alongside, and the spray\ndashed high and swiftly.\n\n\"Well,\" said Flanagan, inflating himself, \"we've had a great deal of a\ntime, and we've come through it all right, and thank Heaven it is all\nover.\"\n\nThe sky in the north-east was of a dull brick-red in tone, shaded here\nand there by black masses that billowed out in some fashion from the\nflat heavens.\n\n\"Look there,\" said the mate.\n\n\"Hum!\" said the captain. \"Looks like a blow, don't it?\"\n\nLater the surface of the water rippled and flickered in the preliminary\nwind. The sea had become the colour of lead. The swashing sound of the\nwaves on the sides of the _Foundling_ was now provided with some manner\nof ominous significance. The men's shouts were hoarse.\n\nA squall struck the _Foundling_ on her starboard quarter, and she\nleaned under the force of it as if she were never to return to the even\nkeel. \"I'll be glad when we get in,\" said the mate. \"I'm going to quit\nthen. I've got enough.\"\n\n\"Hell!\" said the beaming Flanagan.\n\nThe steamer crawled on into the north-west. The white water, sweeping\nout from her, deadened the chug-chug-chug of the tired old engines.\n\nOnce, when the boat careened, she laid her shoulder flat on the sea and\nrested in that manner. The mate, looking down the bridge, which slanted\nmore than a coal-shute, whistled softly to himself. Slowly, heavily,\nthe _Foundling_ arose to meet another sea.\n\nAt night waves thundered mightily on the bows of the steamer, and water\nlit with the beautiful phosphorescent glamour went boiling and howling\nalong deck.\n\nBy good fortune the chief engineer crawled safely, but utterly\ndrenched, to the galley for coffee. \"Well, how goes it, chief?\" said\nthe cook, standing with his fat arms folded in order to prove that he\ncould balance himself under any conditions.\n\nThe engineer shook his head dejectedly. \"This old biscuit-box will\nnever see port again. Why, she'll fall to pieces.\"\n\nFinally at night the captain said, \"Launch the boats.\" The Cubans\nhovered about him. \"Is the ship going to sink?\" The captain addressed\nthem politely. \"Gentlemen, we are in trouble, but all I ask of you is\nthat you just do what I tell you, and no harm will come to anybody.\"\n\nThe mate directed the lowering of the first boat, and the men performed\nthis task with all decency, like people at the side of a grave.\n\nA young oiler came to the captain. \"The chief sends word, sir, that the\nwater is almost up to the fires.\"\n\n\"Keep at it as long as you can.\"\n\n\"Keep at it as long as we can, sir?\"\n\nFlanagan took the senior Cuban officer to the rail, and, as the steamer\nsheered high on a great sea, showed him a yellow dot on the horizon. It\nwas smaller than a needle when its point is towards you.\n\n\"There,\" said the captain. The wind-driven spray was lashing his face.\n\"That's Jupiter Light on the Florida coast. Put your men in the boat\nwe've just launched, and the mate will take you to that light.\"\n\nAfterwards Flanagan turned to the chief engineer. \"We can never beach,\"\nsaid the old man. \"The stokers have got to quit in a minute.\" Tears\nwere in his eyes.\n\nThe _Foundling_ was a wounded thing. She lay on the water with gasping\nengines, and each wave resembled her death-blow.\n\nNow the way of a good ship on the sea is finer than sword-play. But\nthis is when she is alive. If a time comes that the ship dies, then\nher way is the way of a floating old glove, and she has that much vim,\nspirit, buoyancy. At this time many men on the _Foundling_ suddenly\ncame to know that they were clinging to a corpse.\n\nThe captain went to the stoke-room, and what he saw as he swung\ndown the companion suddenly turned him hesitant and dumb. Water was\nswirling to and fro with the roll of the ship, fuming greasily around\nhalf-strangled machinery that still attempted to perform its duty.\nSteam arose from the water, and through its clouds shone the red glare\nof the dying fires. As for the stokers, death might have been with\nsilence in this room. One lay in his berth, his hands under his head,\nstaring moodily at the wall. One sat near the foot of the companion,\nhis face hidden in his arms. One leaned against the side and gazed at\nthe snarling water as it rose, and its mad eddies among the machinery.\nIn the unholy red light and grey mist of this stifling dim Inferno\nthey were strange figures with their silence and their immobility. The\nwretched _Foundling_ groaned deeply as she lifted, and groaned deeply\nas she sank into the trough, while hurried waves then thundered over\nher with the noise of landslides. The terrified machinery was making\ngestures.\n\nBut Flanagan took control of himself suddenly. Then he stirred the\nfire-room. The stillness had been so unearthly that he was not\naltogether inapprehensive of strange and grim deeds when he charged\ninto them; but precisely as they had submitted to the sea so they\nsubmitted to Flanagan. For a moment they rolled their eyes like hurt\ncows, but they obeyed the Voice. The situation simply required a Voice.\n\nWhen the captain returned to the deck the hue of this fire-room was in\nhis mind, and then he understood doom and its weight and complexion.\n\nWhen finally the _Foundling_ sank she shifted and settled as calmly as\nan animal curls down in the bush grass. Away over the waves two bobbing\nboats paused to witness this quiet death. It was a slow manoeuvre,\naltogether without the pageantry of uproar, but it flashed pallor into\nthe faces of all men who saw it, and they groaned when they said,\n\"There she goes!\" Suddenly the captain whirled and knocked his hand on\nthe gunwale. He sobbed for a time, and then he sobbed and swore also.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\nThere was a dance at the Imperial Inn. During the evening some\nirresponsible young men came from the beach bringing the statement that\nseveral boatloads of people had been perceived off shore. It was a\ncharming dance, and none cared to take time to believe this tale. The\nfountain in the court-yard splashed softly, and couple after couple\nparaded through the aisles of palms, where lamps with red shades threw\na rose light upon the gleaming leaves. The band played its waltzes\nslumberously, and its music came faintly to the people among the palms.\n\nSometimes a woman said--\"Oh, it is not really true, is it, that there\nwas a wreck out at sea?\"\n\nA man usually said--\"No, of course not.\"\n\nAt last, however, a youth came violently from the beach. He was\ntriumphant in manner. \"They're out there,\" he cried. \"A whole\nboat-load!\" He received eager attention, and he told all that he\nsupposed. His news destroyed the dance. After a time the band was\nplaying beautifully to space. The guests had hurried to the beach. One\nlittle girl cried, \"Oh, mamma, may I go too?\" Being refused permission\nshe pouted.\n\nAs they came from the shelter of the great hotel, the wind was blowing\nswiftly from the sea, and at intervals a breaker shone livid. The women\nshuddered, and their bending companions seized the opportunity to draw\nthe cloaks closer.\n\n\"Oh, dear!\" said a girl; \"supposin' they were out there drowning while\nwe were dancing!\"\n\n\"Oh, nonsense!\" said her younger brother; \"that don't happen.\"\n\n\"Well, it might, you know, Roger. How can you tell?\"\n\nA man who was not her brother gazed at her then with profound\nadmiration. Later, she complained of the damp sand, and, drawing back\nher skirts, looked ruefully at her little feet.\n\nA mother's son was venturing too near to the water in his interest and\nexcitement. Occasionally she cautioned and reproached him from the\nbackground.\n\nSave for the white glare of the breakers, the sea was a great\nwind-crossed void. From the throng of charming women floated the\nperfume of many flowers. Later there floated to them a body with a calm\nface of an Irish type. The expedition of the _Foundling_ will never be\nhistoric.\n\n\n\n\n              HORSES\n\n\nRichardson pulled up his horse, and looked back over the trail where\nthe crimson serape of his servant flamed amid the dusk of the mesquit.\nThe hills in the west were carved into peaks, and were painted the\nmost profound blue. Above them the sky was of that marvellous tone of\ngreen--like still, sun-shot water--which people denounce in pictures.\n\nJos\u00c3\u00a9 was muffled deep in his blanket, and his great toppling sombrero\nwas drawn low over his brow. He shadowed his master along the dimming\ntrail in the fashion of an assassin. A cold wind of the impending night\nswept over the wilderness of mesquit.\n\n\"Man,\" said Richardson in lame Mexican as the servant drew near, \"I\nwant eat! I want sleep! Understand--no? Quickly! Understand?\"\n\n\"Si, se\u00c3\u00b1or,\" said Jos\u00c3\u00a9, nodding. He stretched one arm out of his\nblanket and pointed a yellow finger into the gloom. \"Over there, small\nvillage. Si, se\u00c3\u00b1or.\"\n\nThey rode forward again. Once the American's horse shied and breathed\nquiveringly at something which he saw or imagined in the darkness,\nand the rider drew a steady, patient rein, and leaned over to speak\ntenderly as if he were addressing a frightened woman. The sky had faded\nto white over the mountains, and the plain was a vast, pointless ocean\nof black.\n\nSuddenly some low houses appeared squatting amid the bushes. The\nhorsemen rode into a hollow until the houses rose against the sombre\nsundown sky, and then up a small hillock, causing these habitations to\nsink like boats in the sea of shadow.\n\nA beam of red firelight fell across the trail. Richardson sat sleepily\non his horse while his servant quarrelled with somebody--a mere voice\nin the gloom--over the price of bed and board. The houses about him\nwere for the most part like tombs in their whiteness and silence, but\nthere were scudding black figures that seemed interested in his arrival.\n\nJos\u00c3\u00a9 came at last to the horses' heads, and the American slid stiffly\nfrom his seat. He muttered a greeting, as with his spurred feet he\nclicked into the adobe house that confronted him. The brown stolid face\nof a woman shone in the light of the fire. He seated himself on the\nearthen floor and blinked drowsily at the blaze. He was aware that the\nwoman was clinking earthenware, and hieing here and everywhere in the\nmanoeuvres of the housewife. From a dark corner there came the sound\nof two or three snores twining together.\n\nThe woman handed him a bowl of tortillas. She was a submissive\ncreature, timid and large-eyed. She gazed at his enormous silver spurs,\nhis large and impressive revolver, with the interest and admiration\nof the highly-privileged cat of the adage. When he ate, she seemed\ntransfixed off there in the gloom, her white teeth shining.\n\nJos\u00c3\u00a9 entered, staggering under two Mexican saddles, large enough for\nbuilding-sites. Richardson decided to smoke a cigarette, and then\nchanged his mind. It would be much finer to go to sleep. His blanket\nhung over his left shoulder, furled into a long pipe of cloth,\naccording to the Mexican fashion. By doffing his sombrero, unfastening\nhis spurs and his revolver belt, he made himself ready for the slow,\nblissful twist into the blanket. Like a cautious man he lay close to\nthe wall, and all his property was very near his hand.\n\nThe mesquit brush burned long. Jos\u00c3\u00a9 threw two gigantic wings of shadow\nas he flapped his blanket about him--first across his chest under his\narms, and then around his neck and across his chest again--this time\nover his arms, with the end tossed on his right shoulder. A Mexican\nthus snugly enveloped can nevertheless free his fighting arm in a\nbeautifully brisk way, merely shrugging his shoulder as he grabs for\nthe weapon at his belt. (They always wear their serapes in this manner.)\n\nThe firelight smothered the rays which, streaming from a moon as large\nas a drum-head, were struggling at the open door. Richardson heard from\nthe plain the fine, rhythmical trample of the hoofs of hurried horses.\nHe went to sleep wondering who rode so fast and so late. And in the\ndeep silence the pale rays of the moon must have prevailed against the\nred spears of the fire until the room was slowly flooded to its middle\nwith a rectangle of silver light.\n\nRichardson was awakened by the sound of a guitar. It was badly\nplayed--in this land of Mexico, from which the romance of the\ninstrument ascends to us like a perfume. The guitar was groaning and\nwhining like a badgered soul. A noise of scuffling feet accompanied the\nmusic. Sometimes laughter arose, and often the voices of men saying\nbitter things to each other, but always the guitar cried on, the treble\nsounding as if some one were beating iron, and the bass humming like\nbees. \"Damn it--they're having a dance,\" he muttered, fretfully. He\nheard two men quarrelling in short, sharp words, like pistol shots;\nthey were calling each other worse names than common people know in\nother countries. He wondered why the noise was so loud. Raising his\nhead from his saddle pillow, he saw, with the help of the valiant\nmoonbeams, a blanket hanging flat against the wall at the further end\nof the room. Being of opinion that it concealed a door, and remembering\nthat Mexican drink made men very drunk, he pulled his revolver closer\nto him and prepared for sudden disaster.\n\nRichardson was dreaming of his far and beloved north.\n\n\"Well, I would kill him, then!\"\n\n\"No, you must not!\"\n\n\"Yes, I will kill him! Listen! I will ask this American beast for his\nbeautiful pistol and spurs and money and saddle, and if he will not\ngive them--you will see!\"\n\n\"But these Americans--they are a strange people. Look out, se\u00c3\u00b1or.\"\n\nThen twenty voices took part in the discussion. They rose in quavering\nshrillness, as from men badly drunk. Richardson felt the skin draw\ntight around his mouth, and his knee-joints turned to bread. He slowly\ncame to a sitting posture, glaring at the motionless blanket at the\nfar end of the room. This stiff and mechanical movement, accomplished\nentirely by the muscles of the waist, must have looked like the rising\nof a corpse in the wan moonlight, which gave everything a hue of the\ngrave.\n\nMy friend, take my advice and never be executed by a hangman who\ndoesn't talk the English language. It, or anything that resembles\nit, is the most difficult of deaths. The tumultuous emotions of\nRichardson's terror destroyed that slow and careful process of thought\nby means of which he understood Mexican. Then he used his instinctive\ncomprehension of the first and universal language, which is tone.\nStill, it is disheartening not to be able to understand the detail of\nthreats against the blood of your body.\n\nSuddenly, the clamour of voices ceased. There was a silence--a silence\nof decision. The blanket was flung aside, and the red light of a torch\nflared into the room. It was held high by a fat, round-faced Mexican,\nwhose little snake-like moustache was as black as his eyes, and whose\neyes were black as jet. He was insane with the wild rage of a man\nwhose liquor is dully burning at his brain. Five or six of his fellows\ncrowded after him. The guitar, which had been thrummed doggedly during\nthe time of the high words, now suddenly stopped. They contemplated\neach other. Richardson sat very straight and still, his right hand lost\nin his blanket. The Mexicans jostled in the light of the torch, their\neyes blinking and glittering.\n\nThe fat one posed in the manner of a grandee. Presently his hand\ndropped to his belt, and from his lips there spun an epithet--a hideous\nword which often foreshadows knife-blows, a word peculiarly of Mexico,\nwhere people have to dig deep to find an insult that has not lost its\nsavour. The American did not move. He was staring at the fat Mexican\nwith a strange fixedness of gaze, not fearful, not dauntless, not\nanything that could be interpreted. He simply stared.\n\nThe fat Mexican must have been disconcerted, for he continued to\npose as a grandee, with more and more sublimity, until it would have\nbeen easy for him to have fallen over backward. His companions were\nswaying very drunkenly. They still blinked their little beady eyes at\nRichardson. Ah, well, sirs, here was a mystery! At the approach of\ntheir menacing company, why did not this American cry out and turn\npale, or run, or pray them mercy? The animal merely sat still, and\nstared, and waited for them to begin. Well, evidently he was a great\nfighter! Or perhaps he was an idiot? Indeed, this was an embarrassing\nsituation, for who was going forward to discover whether he was a great\nfighter or an idiot?\n\nTo Richardson, whose nerves were tingling and twitching like live\nwires, and whose heart jolted inside him, this pause was a long horror;\nand for these men, who could so frighten him, there began to swell in\nhim a fierce hatred--a hatred that made him long to be capable of\nfighting all of them, a hatred that made him capable of fighting all\nof them. A 44-calibre revolver can make a hole large enough for little\nboys to shoot marbles through; and there was a certain fat Mexican with\na moustache like a snake who came extremely near to have eaten his last\ntomale merely because he frightened a man too much.\n\nJos\u00c3\u00a9 had slept the first part of the night in his fashion, his body\nhunched into a heap, his legs crooked, his head touching his knees.\nShadows had obscured him from the sight of the invaders. At this point\nhe arose, and began to prowl quakingly over toward Richardson, as if he\nmeant to hide behind him.\n\nOf a sudden the fat Mexican gave a howl of glee. Jos\u00c3\u00a9 had come within\nthe torch's circle of light. With roars of ferocity the whole group of\nMexicans pounced on the American's servant. He shrank shuddering away\nfrom them, beseeching by every device of word and gesture. They pushed\nhim this way and that. They beat him with their fists. They stung him\nwith their curses. As he grovelled on his knees, the fat Mexican took\nhim by the throat and said--\"I am going to kill you!\" And continually\nthey turned their eyes to see if they were to succeed in causing the\ninitial demonstration by the American. But he looked on impassively.\nUnder the blanket his fingers were clenched, as iron, upon the handle\nof his revolver.\n\nHere suddenly two brilliant clashing chords from the guitar were\nheard, and a woman's voice, full of laughter and confidence, cried\nfrom without--\"Hello! hello! Where are you?\" The lurching company of\nMexicans instantly paused and looked at the ground. One said, as he\nstood with his legs wide apart in order to balance himself--\"It is the\ngirls. They have come!\" He screamed in answer to the question of the\nwoman--\"Here!\" And without waiting he started on a pilgrimage toward\nthe blanket-covered door. One could now hear a number of female voices\ngiggling and chattering.\n\nTwo other Mexicans said--\"Yes, it is the girls! Yes!\" They also started\nquietly away. Even the fat Mexican's ferocity seemed to be affected.\nHe looked uncertainly at the still immovable American. Two of his\nfriends grasped him gaily--\"Come, the girls are here! Come!\" He cast\nanother glower at Richardson. \"But this----,\" he began. Laughing, his\ncomrades hustled him toward the door. On its threshold, and holding\nback the blanket, with one hand, he turned his yellow face with a last\nchallenging glare toward the American. Jos\u00c3\u00a9, bewailing his state in\nlittle sobs of utter despair and woe, crept to Richardson and huddled\nnear his knee. Then the cries of the Mexicans meeting the girls were\nheard, and the guitar burst out in joyous humming.\n\nThe moon clouded, and but a faint square of light fell through the\nopen main door of the house. The coals of the fire were silent, save\nfor occasional sputters. Richardson did not change his position. He\nremained staring at the blanket which hid the strategic door in the far\nend. At his knees Jos\u00c3\u00a9 was arguing, in a low, aggrieved tone, with the\nsaints. Without, the Mexicans laughed and danced, and--it would appear\nfrom the sound--drank more.\n\nIn the stillness and the night Richardson sat wondering if some\nserpent-like Mexican were sliding towards him in the darkness, and if\nthe first thing he knew of it would be the deadly sting of a knife.\n\"Sssh,\" he whispered, to Jos\u00c3\u00a9. He drew his revolver from under the\nblanket, and held it on his leg. The blanket over the door fascinated\nhim. It was a vague form, black and unmoving. Through the opening it\nshielded were to come, probably, threats, death. Sometimes he thought\nhe saw it move. As grim white sheets, the black and silver of coffins,\nall the panoply of death, affect us, because of that which they hide,\nso this blanket, dangling before a hole in an adobe wall, was to\nRichardson a horrible emblem, and a horrible thing in itself. In his\npresent mood he could not have been brought to touch it with his finger.\n\nThe celebrating Mexicans occasionally howled in song. The guitarist\nplayed with speed and enthusiasm. Richardson longed to run. But in this\nvibrating and threatening gloom his terror convinced him that a move\non his part would be a signal for the pounce of death. Jos\u00c3\u00a9, crouching\nabjectly, mumbled now and again. Slowly, and ponderous as stars, the\nminutes went.\n\nSuddenly Richardson thrilled and started. His breath for a moment left\nhim. In sleep his nerveless fingers had allowed his revolver to fall\nand clang upon the hard floor. He grabbed it up hastily, and his glance\nswept apprehensively over the room. A chill blue light of dawn was\nin the place. Every outline was slowly growing; detail was following\ndetail. The dread blanket did not move. The riotous company had gone\nor fallen silent. He felt the effect of this cold dawn in his blood.\nThe candour of breaking day brought his nerve. He touched Jos\u00c3\u00a9. \"Come,\"\nhe said. His servant lifted his lined yellow face, and comprehended.\nRichardson buckled on his spurs and strode up; Jos\u00c3\u00a9 obediently lifted\nthe two great saddles. Richardson held two bridles and a blanket on his\nleft arm; in his right hand he had his revolver. They sneaked toward\nthe door.\n\nThe man who said that spurs jingled was insane. Spurs have a mellow\nclash--clash--clash. Walking in spurs--notably Mexican spurs--you\nremind yourself vaguely of a telegraphic linesman. Richardson was\ninexpressibly shocked when he came to walk. He sounded to himself like\na pair of cymbals. He would have known of this if he had reflected; but\nthen, he was escaping, not reflecting. He made a gesture of despair,\nand from under the two saddles Jos\u00c3\u00a9 tried to make one of hopeless\nhorror. Richardson stooped, and with shaking fingers unfastened the\nspurs. Taking them in his left hand, he picked up his revolver, and\nthey slunk on toward the door. On the threshold he looked back. In a\ncorner he saw, watching him with large eyes, the Indian man and woman\nwho had been his hosts. Throughout the night they had made no sign, and\nnow they neither spoke nor moved. Yet Richardson thought he detected\nmeek satisfaction at his departure.\n\nThe street was still and deserted. In the eastern sky there was a\nlemon-coloured patch. Jos\u00c3\u00a9 had picketed the horses at the side of the\nhouse. As the two men came round the corner Richardson's beast set up\na whinny of welcome. The little horse had heard them coming. He stood\nfacing them, his ears cocked forward, his eyes bright with welcome.\n\nRichardson made a frantic gesture, but the horse, in his happiness at\nthe appearance of his friends, whinnied with enthusiasm. The American\nfelt that he could have strangled his well-beloved steed. Upon the\nthreshold of safety, he was being betrayed by his horse, his friend! He\nfelt the same hate that he would have felt for a dragon. And yet, as he\nglanced wildly about him, he could see nothing stirring in the street,\nnothing at the doors of the tomb-like houses.\n\nJos\u00c3\u00a9 had his own saddle-girth and both bridles buckled in a moment. He\ncurled the picket-ropes with a few sweeps of his arm. The American's\nfingers, however, were shaking so that he could hardly buckle the\ngirth. His hands were in invisible mittens. He was wondering,\ncalculating, hoping about his horse. He knew the little animal's\nwillingness and courage under all circumstances up to this time; but\nthen--here it was different. Who could tell if some wretched instance\nof equine perversity was not about to develop? Maybe the little fellow\nwould not feel like smoking over the plain at express speed this\nmorning, and so he would rebel, and kick, and be wicked. Maybe he would\nbe without feeling of interest, and run listlessly. All riders who have\nhad to hurry in the saddle know what it is to be on a horse who does\nnot understand the dramatic situation. Riding a lame sheep is bliss\nto it. Richardson, fumbling furiously at the girth, thought of these\nthings.\n\nPresently he had it fastened. He swung into the saddle, and as he did\nso his horse made a mad jump forward. The spurs of Jos\u00c3\u00a9 scratched and\ntore the flanks of his great black beast, and side by side the two\nhorses raced down the village street. The American heard his horse\nbreathe a quivering sigh of excitement. Those four feet skimmed. They\nwere as light as fairy puff balls. The houses glided past in a moment,\nand the great, clear, silent plain appeared like a pale blue sea of\nmist and wet bushes. Above the mountains the colours of the sunlight\nwere like the first tones, the opening chords of the mighty hymn of the\nmorning.\n\nThe American looked down at his horse. He felt in his heart the first\nthrill of confidence. The little animal, unurged and quite tranquil,\nmoving his ears this way and that way with an air of interest in the\nscenery, was nevertheless bounding into the eye of the breaking day\nwith the speed of a frightened antelope. Richardson, looking down, saw\nthe long, fine reach of forelimb as steady as steel machinery. As the\nground reeled past, the long, dried grasses hissed, and cactus plants\nwere dull blurs. A wind whirled the horse's mane over his rider's\nbridle hand.\n\nJos\u00c3\u00a9's profile was lined against the pale sky. It was as that of a man\nwho swims alone in an ocean. His eyes glinted like metal, fastened\non some unknown point ahead of him, some fabulous place of safety.\nOccasionally his mouth puckered in a little unheard cry; and his legs,\nbended back, worked spasmodically as his spurred heels sliced his\ncharger's sides.\n\nRichardson consulted the gloom in the west for signs of a hard-riding,\nyelling cavalcade. He knew that, whereas his friends the enemy had\nnot attacked him when he had sat still and with apparent calmness\nconfronted them, they would take furiously after him now that he had\nrun from them--now that he had confessed himself the weaker. Their\nvalour would grow like weeds in the spring, and upon discovering his\nescape they would ride forth dauntless warriors. Sometimes he was sure\nhe saw them. Sometimes he was sure he heard them. Continually looking\nbackward over his shoulder, he studied the purple expanses where the\nnight was marching away. Jos\u00c3\u00a9 rolled and shuddered in his saddle,\npersistently disturbing the stride of the black horse, fretting and\nworrying him until the white foam flew, and the great shoulders shone\nlike satin from the sweat.\n\nAt last, Richardson drew his horse carefully down to a walk. Jos\u00c3\u00a9\nwished to rush insanely on, but the American spoke to him sternly. As\nthe two paced forward side by side, Richardson's little horse thrust\nover his soft nose and inquired into the black's condition.\n\nRiding with Jos\u00c3\u00a9 was like riding with a corpse. His face resembled a\ncast in lead. Sometimes he swung forward and almost pitched from his\nseat. Richardson was too frightened himself to do anything but hate\nthis man for his fear. Finally, he issued a mandate which nearly caused\nJos\u00c3\u00a9's eyes to slide out of his head and fall to the ground, like two\ncoins:--\"Ride behind me--about fifty paces.\"\n\n\"Se\u00c3\u00b1or----\" stuttered the servant. \"Go,\" cried the American furiously.\nHe glared at the other and laid his hand on his revolver. Jos\u00c3\u00a9 looked\nat his master wildly. He made a piteous gesture. Then slowly he fell\nback, watching the hard face of the American for a sign of mercy. But\nRichardson had resolved in his rage that at any rate he was going to\nuse the eyes and ears of extreme fear to detect the approach of danger;\nso he established his panic-stricken servant as a sort of outpost.\n\nAs they proceeded, he was obliged to watch sharply to see that the\nservant did not slink forward and join him. When Jos\u00c3\u00a9 made beseeching\ncircles in the air with his arm, he replied by menacingly gripping his\nrevolver. Jos\u00c3\u00a9 had a revolver too; nevertheless it was very clear in\nhis mind that the revolver was distinctly an American weapon. He had\nbeen educated in the Rio Grande country.\n\nRichardson lost the trail once. He was recalled to it by the loud sobs\nof his servant.\n\nThen at last Jos\u00c3\u00a9 came clattering forward, gesticulating and wailing.\nThe little horse sprang to the shoulder of the black. They were off.\n\nRichardson, again looking backward, could see a slanting flare of dust\non the whitening plain. He thought that he could detect small moving\nfigures in it.\n\nJos\u00c3\u00a9's moans and cries amounted to a university course in theology.\nThey broke continually from his quivering lips. His spurs were\nas motors. They forced the black horse over the plain in great\nheadlong leaps. But under Richardson there was a little insignificant\nrat-coloured beast who was running apparently with almost as much\neffort as it takes a bronze statue to stand still. The ground seemed\nmerely something to be touched from time to time with hoofs that were\nas light as blown leaves. Occasionally Richardson lay back and pulled\nstoutly at the bridle to keep from abandoning his servant. Jos\u00c3\u00a9 harried\nat his horse's mouth, flopped about in the saddle, and made his two\nheels beat like flails. The black ran like a horse in despair.\n\nCrimson serapes in the distance resemble drops of blood on the great\ncloth of plain. Richardson began to dream of all possible chances.\nAlthough quite a humane man, he did not once think of his servant. Jos\u00c3\u00a9\nbeing a Mexican, it was natural that he should be killed in Mexico;\nbut for himself, a New Yorker----! He remembered all the tales of such\nraces for life, and he thought them badly written.\n\nThe great black horse was growing indifferent. The jabs of Jos\u00c3\u00a9's spurs\nno longer caused him to bound forward in wild leaps of pain. Jos\u00c3\u00a9 had\nat last succeeded in teaching him that spurring was to be expected,\nspeed or no speed, and now he took the pain of it dully and stolidly,\nas an animal who finds that doing his best gains him no respite. Jos\u00c3\u00a9\nwas turned into a raving maniac. He bellowed and screamed, working his\narms and his heels like one in a fit. He resembled a man on a sinking\nship, who appeals to the ship. Richardson, too, cried madly to the\nblack horse. The spirit of the horse responded to these calls, and\nquivering and breathing heavily he made a great effort, a sort of a\nfinal rush, not for himself apparently, but because he understood\nthat his life's sacrifice, perhaps, had been invoked by these two men\nwho cried to him in the universal tongue. Richardson had no sense of\nappreciation at this time--he was too frightened; but often now he\nremembers a certain black horse.\n\nFrom the rear could be heard a yelling, and once a shot was fired--in\nthe air, evidently. Richardson moaned as he looked back. He kept his\nhand on his revolver. He tried to imagine the brief tumult of his\ncapture--the flurry of dust from the hoofs of horses pulled suddenly\nto their haunches, the shrill, biting curses of the men, the ring of\nthe shots, his own last contortion. He wondered, too, if he could not\nsomehow manage to pelt that fat Mexican, just to cure his abominable\negotism.\n\nIt was Jos\u00c3\u00a9, the terror-stricken, who at last discovered safety.\nSuddenly he gave a howl of delight and astonished his horse into a\nnew burst of speed. They were on a little ridge at the time, and the\nAmerican at the top of it saw his servant gallop down the slope and\ninto the arms, so to speak, of a small column of horsemen in grey and\nsilver clothes. In the dim light of the early morning they were as\nvague as shadows, but Richardson knew them at once for a detachment of\nRurales, that crack cavalry corps of the Mexican army which polices\nthe plain so zealously, being of themselves the law and the arm of\nit--a fierce and swift-moving body that knows little of prevention\nbut much of vengeance. They drew up suddenly, and the rows of great\nsilver-trimmed sombreros bobbed in surprise.\n\nRichardson saw Jos\u00c3\u00a9 throw himself from his horse and begin to jabber\nat the leader. When he arrived he found that his servant had already\noutlined the entire situation, and was then engaged in describing him,\nRichardson, as an American se\u00c3\u00b1or of vast wealth, who was the friend\nof almost every governmental potentate within two hundred miles.\nThis seemed profoundly to impress the officer. He bowed gravely to\nRichardson and smiled significantly at his men, who unslung their\ncarbines.\n\nThe little ridge hid the pursuers from view, but the rapid thud of\ntheir horses' feet could be heard. Occasionally they yelled and called\nto each other. Then at last they swept over the brow of the hill, a\nwild mob of almost fifty drunken horsemen. When they discerned the\npale-uniformed Rurales, they were sailing down the slope at top speed.\n\nIf toboggans half-way down a hill should suddenly make up their minds\nto turn round and go back, there would be an effect something like that\nproduced by the drunken horsemen. Richardson saw the Rurales serenely\nswing their carbines forward, and, peculiar-minded person that he was,\nfelt his heart leap into his throat at the prospective volley. But the\nofficer rode forward alone.\n\nIt appeared that the man who owned the best horse in this astonished\ncompany was the fat Mexican with the snaky moustache, and, in\nconsequence, this gentleman was quite a distance in the van. He tried\nto pull up, wheel his horse, and scuttle back over the hill as some of\nhis companions had done, but the officer called to him in a voice harsh\nwith rage. \"----!\" howled the officer. \"This se\u00c3\u00b1or is my friend, the\nfriend of my friends. Do you dare pursue him,----?----!----!----!----!\"\nThese dashes represent terrible names, all different, used by the\nofficer.\n\nThe fat Mexican simply grovelled on his horse's neck. His face was\ngreen: it could be seen that he expected death. The officer stormed\nwith magnificent intensity: \"----!----!----!\" Finally he sprang from\nhis saddle, and, running to the fat Mexican's side, yelled--\"Go!\" and\nkicked the horse in the belly with all his might. The animal gave\na mighty leap into the air, and the fat Mexican, with one wretched\nglance at the contemplative Rurales, aimed his steed for the top of the\nridge. Richardson gulped again in expectation of a volley, for--it is\nsaid--this is a favourite method for disposing of objectionable people.\nThe fat, green Mexican also thought that he was to be killed on the\nrun, from the miserable look he cast at the troops. Nevertheless, he\nwas allowed to vanish in a cloud of yellow dust at the ridge-top.\n\nJos\u00c3\u00a9 was exultant, defiant, and, oh! bristling with courage. The black\nhorse was drooping sadly, his nose to the ground. Richardson's little\nanimal, with his ears bent forward, was staring at the horses of the\nRurales as if in an intense study. Richardson longed for speech, but\nhe could only bend forward and pat the shining, silken shoulders. The\nlittle horse turned his head and looked back gravely.\n\n\n\n\n           DEATH AND THE CHILD\n\n\n                   I\n\nThe peasants who were streaming down the mountain trail had in their\nsharp terror evidently lost their ability to count. The cattle and\nthe huge round bundles seemed to suffice to the minds of the crowd\nif there were now two in each case where there had been three. This\nbrown stream poured on with a constant wastage of goods and beasts.\nA goat fell behind to scout the dried grass and its owner, howling,\nflogging his donkeys, passed far ahead. A colt, suddenly frightened,\nmade a stumbling charge up the hill-side. The expenditure was always\nprofligate and always unnamed, unnoted. It was as if fear was a river,\nand this horde had simply been caught in the torrent, man tumbling\nover beast, beast over man, as helpless in it as the logs that fall\nand shoulder grindingly through the gorges of a lumber country. It\nwas a freshet that might sear the face of the tall quiet mountain; it\nmight draw a livid line across the land, this downpour of fear with\na thousand homes adrift in the current--men, women, babes, animals.\nFrom it there arose a constant babble of tongues, shrill, broken, and\nsometimes choking as from men drowning. Many made gestures, painting\ntheir agonies on the air with fingers that twirled swiftly.\n\nThe blue bay with its pointed ships and the white town lay below them,\ndistant, flat, serene. There was upon this vista a peace that a bird\nknows when high in the air it surveys the world, a great calm thing\nrolling noiselessly toward the end of the mystery. Here on the height\none felt the existence of the universe scornfully defining the pain\nin ten thousand minds. The sky was an arch of stolid sapphire. Even\nto the mountains raising their mighty shapes from the valley, this\nheadlong rush of the fugitives was too minute. The sea, the sky, and\nthe hills combined in their grandeur to term this misery inconsequent.\nThen too it sometimes happened that a face seen as it passed on the\nflood reflected curiously the spirit of them all and still more. One\nsaw then a woman of the opinion of the vaults above the clouds. When\na child cried it cried always because of some adjacent misfortune,\nsome discomfort of a pack-saddle or rudeness of an encircling arm. In\nthe dismal melody of this flight there were often sounding chords of\napathy. Into these preoccupied countenances, one felt that needles\ncould be thrust without purchasing a scream. The trail wound here and\nthere as the sheep had willed in the making of it.\n\nAlthough this throng seemed to prove that the whole of humanity was\nfleeing in one direction--with every tie severed that binds us to the\nsoil--a young man was walking rapidly up the mountain, hastening to\na side of the path from time to time to avoid some particularly wide\nrush of people and cattle. He looked at everything in agitation and\npity. Frequently he called admonitions to maniacal fugitives, and at\nother moments he exchanged strange stares with the imperturbable ones.\nThey seemed to him to wear merely the expressions of so many boulders\nrolling down the hill. He exhibited wonder and awe with his pitying\nglances.\n\nTurning once toward the rear, he saw a man in the uniform of a\nlieutenant of infantry marching the same way. He waited then,\nsubconsciously elate at a prospect of being able to make into words\nthe emotion which heretofore had only been expressed in the flash of\neyes and sensitive movements of his flexible mouth. He spoke to the\nofficer in rapid French, waving his arms wildly, and often pointing\nwith a dramatic finger. \"Ah, this is too cruel, too cruel, too cruel.\nIs it not? I did not think it would be as bad as this. I did not\nthink--God's mercy--I did not think at all. And yet I am a Greek. Or at\nleast my father was a Greek. I did not come here to fight. I am really\na correspondent, you see? I was to write for an Italian paper. I have\nbeen educated in Italy. I have spent nearly all my life in Italy. At\nthe schools and universities! I knew nothing of war! I was a student--a\nstudent. I came here merely because my father was a Greek, and for his\nsake I thought of Greece--I loved Greece. But I did not dream----\"\n\nHe paused, breathing heavily. His eyes glistened from that soft\noverflow which comes on occasion to the glance of a young woman.\nEager, passionate, profoundly moved, his first words, while facing\nthe procession of fugitives, had been an active definition of his own\ndimension, his personal relation to men, geography, life. Throughout he\nhad preserved the fiery dignity of a tragedian.\n\nThe officer's manner at once deferred to this outburst. \"Yes,\" he said,\npolite but mournful, \"these poor people! These poor people! I do not\nknow what is to become of these poor people.\"\n\nThe young man declaimed again. \"I had no dream--I had no dream that it\nwould be like this! This is too cruel! Too cruel! Now I want to be a\nsoldier. Now I want to fight. Now I want to do battle for the land of\nmy father.\" He made a sweeping gesture into the north-west.\n\nThe officer was also a young man, but he was very bronzed and steady.\nAbove his high military collar of crimson cloth with one silver star\nupon it, appeared a profile stern, quiet, and confident, respecting\nfate, fearing only opinion. His clothes were covered with dust; the\nonly bright spot was the flame of the crimson collar. At the violent\ncries of his companion he smiled as if to himself, meanwhile keeping\nhis eyes fixed in a glance ahead.\n\nFrom a land toward which their faces were bent came a continuous\nboom of artillery fire. It was sounding in regular measures like the\nbeating of a colossal clock, a clock that was counting the seconds in\nthe lives of the stars, and men had time to die between the ticks.\nSolemn, oracular, inexorable, the great seconds tolled over the hills\nas if God fronted this dial rimmed by the horizon. The soldier and\nthe correspondent found themselves silent. The latter in particular\nwas sunk in a great mournfulness, as if he had resolved willy-nilly\nto swing to the bottom of the abyss where dwell secrets of his kind,\nand had learned beforehand that all to be met there was cruelty\nand hopelessness. A strap of his bright new leather leggings came\nunfastened, and he bowed over it slowly, impressively, as one bending\nover the grave of a child.\n\nThen suddenly, the reverberations mingled until one could not separate\nan explosion from another, and into the hubbub came the drawling sound\nof a leisurely musketry fire. Instantly, for some reason of cadence,\nthe noise was irritating, silly, infantile. This uproar was childish.\nIt forced the nerves to object, to protest against this racket which\nwas as idle as the din of a lad with a drum.\n\nThe lieutenant lifted his finger and pointed. He spoke in vexed\ntones, as if he held the other man personally responsible for the\nnoise. \"Well, there!\" he said. \"If you wish for war you now have an\nopportunity magnificent.\"\n\nThe correspondent raised himself upon his toes. He tapped his chest\nwith gloomy pride. \"Yes! There is war! There is the war I wish to\nenter. I fling myself in. I am a Greek, a Greek, you understand. I wish\nto fight for my country. You know the way. Lead me. I offer myself.\"\nStruck by a sudden thought he brought a case from his pocket, and\nextracting a card handed it to the officer with a bow. \"My name is\nPeza,\" he said simply.\n\nA strange smile passed over the soldier's face. There was pity and\npride--the vanity of experience--and contempt in it. \"Very well,\" he\nsaid, returning the bow. \"If my company is in the middle of the fight\nI shall be glad for the honour of your companionship. If my company is\nnot in the middle of the fight--I will make other arrangements for you.\"\n\nPeza bowed once more, very stiffly, and correctly spoke his thanks.\nOn the edge of what he took to be a great venture toward death, he\ndiscovered that he was annoyed at something in the lieutenant's tone.\nThings immediately assumed new and extraordinary proportions. The\nbattle, the great carnival of woe, was sunk at once to an equation with\na vexation by a stranger. He wanted to ask the lieutenant what was his\nmeaning. He bowed again majestically; the lieutenant bowed. They flung\na shadow of manners, of capering tinsel ceremony across a land that\ngroaned, and it satisfied something within themselves completely.\n\nIn the meantime, the river of fleeing villagers had changed to simply\na last dropping of belated creatures, who fled past stammering and\nflinging their hands high. The two men had come to the top of the great\nhill. Before them was a green plain as level as an inland sea. It swept\nnorthward, and merged finally into a length of silvery mist. Upon the\nnear part of this plain, and upon two grey treeless mountains at the\nside of it, were little black lines from which floated slanting sheets\nof smoke. It was not a battle to the nerves. One could survey it with\nequanimity, as if it were a tea-table; but upon Peza's mind it struck a\nloud clanging blow. It was war. Edified, aghast, triumphant, he paused\nsuddenly, his lips apart. He remembered the pageants of carnage that\nhad marched through the dreams of his childhood. Love he knew that he\nhad confronted, alone, isolated, wondering, an individual, an atom\ntaking the hand of a titanic principle. But, like the faintest breeze\non his forehead, he felt here the vibration from the hearts of forty\nthousand men.\n\nThe lieutenant's nostrils were moving. \"I must go at once,\" he said. \"I\nmust go at once.\"\n\n\"I will go with you wherever you go,\" shouted Peza loudly.\n\nA primitive track wound down the side of the mountain, and in their\nrush they bounded from here to there, choosing risks which in the\nordinary caution of man would surely have seemed of remarkable danger.\nThe ardour of the correspondent surpassed the full energy of the\nsoldier. Several times he turned and shouted, \"Come on! Come on!\"\n\nAt the foot of the path they came to a wide road, which extended\ntoward the battle in a yellow and straight line. Some men were\ntrudging wearily to the rear. They were without rifles; their clumsy\nuniforms were dirty and all awry. They turned eyes dully aglow with\nfever upon the pair striding toward the battle. Others were bandaged\nwith the triangular kerchief upon which one could still see through\nbloodstains the little explanatory pictures illustrating the ways to\nbind various wounds. \"Fig. 1.\"--\"Fig. 2.\"--\"Fig. 7.\" Mingled with\nthe pacing soldiers were peasants, indifferent, capable of smiling,\ngibbering about the battle, which was to them an ulterior drama. A man\nwas leading a string of three donkeys to the rear, and at intervals\nhe was accosted by wounded or fevered soldiers, from whom he defended\nhis animals with ape-like cries and mad gesticulation. After much\nchattering they usually subsided gloomily, and allowed him to go with\nhis sleek little beasts unburdened. Finally he encountered a soldier\nwho walked slowly with the assistance of a staff. His head was bound\nwith a wide bandage, grimey from blood and mud. He made application to\nthe peasant, and immediately they were involved in a hideous Levantine\ndiscussion. The peasant whined and clamoured, sometimes spitting like\na kitten. The wounded soldier jawed on thunderously, his great hands\nstretched in claw-like graspings over the peasant's head. Once he\nraised his staff and made threat with it. Then suddenly the row was at\nan end. The other sick men saw their comrade mount the leading donkey\nand at once begin to drum with his heels. None attempted to gain the\nbacks of the remaining animals. They gazed after them dully. Finally\nthey saw the caravan outlined for a moment against the sky. The soldier\nwas still waving his arms passionately, having it out with the peasant.\n\nPeza was alive with despair for these men who looked at him with such\ndoleful, quiet eyes. \"Ah, my God!\" he cried to the lieutenant, \"these\npoor souls! These poor souls!\"\n\nThe officer faced about angrily. \"If you are coming with me there is\nno time for this.\" Peza obeyed instantly and with a sudden meekness. In\nthe moment some portion of egotism left him, and he modestly wondered\nif the universe took cognizance of him to an important degree. This\ntheatre for slaughter, built by the inscrutable needs of the earth, was\nan enormous affair, and he reflected that the accidental destruction of\nan individual, Peza by name, would perhaps be nothing at all.\n\nWith the lieutenant he was soon walking along behind a series of little\ncrescent-shape trenches, in which were soldiers, tranquilly interested,\ngossiping with the hum of a tea-party. Although these men were not at\nthis time under fire, he concluded that they were fabulously brave.\nElse they would not be so comfortable, so at home in their sticky brown\ntrenches. They were certain to be heavily attacked before the day was\nold. The universities had not taught him to understand this attitude.\n\nAt the passing of the young man in very nice tweed, with his new\nleggings, his new white helmet, his new field-glass case, his new\nrevolver holster, the soiled soldiers turned with the same curiosity\nwhich a being in strange garb meets at the corners of streets. He might\nas well have been promenading a populous avenue. The soldiers volubly\ndiscussed his identity.\n\nTo Peza there was something awful in the absolute familiarity of each\ntone, expression, gesture. These men, menaced with battle, displayed\nthe curiosity of the caf\u00c3\u00a9. Then, on the verge of his great encounter\ntoward death, he found himself extremely embarrassed, composing his\nface with difficulty, wondering what to do with his hands, like a gawk\nat a lev\u00c3\u00a9e.\n\nHe felt ridiculous, and also he felt awed, aghast, at these men who\ncould turn their faces from the ominous front and debate his clothes,\nhis business. There was an element which was new born into his theory\nof war. He was not averse to the brisk pace at which the lieutenant\nmoved along the line.\n\nThe roar of fighting was always in Peza's ears. It came from some short\nhills ahead and to the left. The road curved suddenly and entered a\nwood. The trees stretched their luxuriant and graceful branches over\ngrassy slopes. A breeze made all this verdure gently rustle and speak\nin long silken sighs. Absorbed in listening to the hurricane racket\nfrom the front, he still remembered that these trees were growing, the\ngrass-blades were extending according to their process. He inhaled a\ndeep breath of moisture and fragrance from the grove, a wet odour which\nexpressed all the opulent fecundity of unmoved nature, marching on with\nher million plans for multiple life, multiple death.\n\nFurther on, they came to a place where the Turkish shells were landing.\nThere was a long hurtling sound in the air, and then one had sight of a\nshell. To Peza it was of the conical missiles which friendly officers\nhad displayed to him on board warships. Curiously enough, too, this\nfirst shell smacked of the foundry, of men with smudged faces, of the\nblare of furnace fires. It brought machinery immediately into his mind.\nHe thought that if he was killed there at that time it would be as\nromantic, to the old standards, as death by a bit of falling iron in a\nfactory.\n\n\n                   II\n\nA child was playing on a mountain and disregarding a battle that was\nwaging on the plain. Behind him was the little cobbled hut of his fled\nparents. It was now occupied by a pearl-coloured cow that stared out\nfrom the darkness thoughtful and tender-eyed. The child ran to and fro,\nfumbling with sticks and making great machinations with pebbles. By a\nstriking exercise of artistic license the sticks were ponies, cows, and\ndogs, and the pebbles were sheep. He was managing large agricultural\nand herding affairs. He was too intent on them to pay much heed to\nthe fight four miles away, which at that distance resembled in sound\nthe beating of surf upon rocks. However, there were occasions when\nsome louder outbreak of that thunder stirred him from his serious\noccupation, and he turned then a questioning eye upon the battle, a\nsmall stick poised in his hand, interrupted in the act of sending his\ndog after his sheep. His tranquillity in regard to the death on the\nplain was as invincible as that of the mountain on which he stood.\n\nIt was evident that fear had swept the parents away from their home\nin a manner that could make them forget this child, the first-born.\nNevertheless, the hut was clean bare. The cow had committed no\nimpropriety in billeting herself at the domicile of her masters. This\nsmoke-coloured and odorous interior contained nothing as large as\na humming-bird. Terror had operated on these runaway people in its\nsinister fashion, elevating details to enormous heights, causing a man\nto remember a button while he forgot a coat, overpowering every one\nwith recollections of a broken coffee-cup, deluging them with fears for\nthe safety of an old pipe, and causing them to forget their first-born.\nMeanwhile the child played soberly with his trinkets.\n\nHe was solitary; engrossed in his own pursuits, it was seldom that he\nlifted his head to inquire of the world why it made so much noise. The\nstick in his hand was much larger to him than was an army corps of the\ndistance. It was too childish for the mind of the child. He was dealing\nwith sticks.\n\nThe battle lines writhed at times in the agony of a sea-creature on\nthe sands. These tentacles flung and waved in a supreme excitement of\npain, and the struggles of the great outlined body brought it nearer\nand nearer to the child. Once he looked at the plain and saw some men\nrunning wildly across a field. He had seen people chasing obdurate\nbeasts in such fashion, and it struck him immediately that it was\na manly thing which he would incorporate in his game. Consequently\nhe raced furiously at his stone sheep, flourishing a cudgel, crying\nthe shepherd calls. He paused frequently to get a cue of manner from\nthe soldiers fighting on the plain. He reproduced, to a degree, any\nmovements which he accounted rational to his theory of sheep-herding,\nthe business of men, the traditional and exalted living of his father.\n\n\n                   III\n\nIt was as if Peza was a corpse walking on the bottom of the sea, and\nfinding there fields of grain, groves, weeds, the faces of men, voices.\nWar, a strange employment of the race, presented to him a scene crowded\nwith familiar objects which wore the livery of their commonness,\nplacidly, undauntedly. He was smitten with keen astonishment; a spread\nof green grass lit with the flames of poppies was too old for the\ncompany of this new ogre. If he had been devoting the full lens of his\nmind to this phase, he would have known he was amazed that the trees,\nthe flowers, the grass, all tender and peaceful nature had not taken to\nheels at once upon the outbreak of battle. He venerated the immovable\npoppies.\n\nThe road seemed to lead into the apex of an angle formed by the two\ndefensive lines of the Greeks. There was a straggle of wounded men and\nof gunless and jaded men. These latter did not seem to be frightened.\nThey remained very cool, walking with unhurried steps and busy in\ngossip. Peza tried to define them. Perhaps during the fight they\nhad reached the limit of their mental storage, their capacity for\nexcitement, for tragedy, and had then simply come away. Peza remembered\nhis visit to a certain place of pictures, where he had found himself\namid heavenly skies and diabolic midnights--the sunshine beating\nred upon desert sands, nude bodies flung to the shore in the green\nmoon-glow, ghastly and starving men clawing at a wall in darkness, a\ngirl at her bath with screened rays falling upon her pearly shoulders,\na dance, a funeral, a review, an execution, all the strength of\nargus-eyed art: and he had whirled and whirled amid this universe with\ncries of woe and joy, sin and beauty piercing his ears until he had\nbeen obliged to simply come away. He remembered that as he had emerged\nhe had lit a cigarette with unction and advanced promptly to a caf\u00c3\u00a9. A\ngreat hollow quiet seemed to be upon the earth.\n\nThis was a different case, but in his thoughts he conceded the same\ncauses to many of these gunless wanderers. They too may have dreamed\nat lightning speed until the capacity for it was overwhelmed. As he\nwatched them, he again saw himself walking toward the caf\u00c3\u00a9, puffing\nupon his cigarette. As if to reinforce his theory, a soldier stopped\nhim with an eager but polite inquiry for a match. He watched the\nman light his little roll of tobacco and paper and begin to smoke\nravenously.\n\nPeza no longer was torn with sorrow at the sight of wounded men.\nEvidently he found that pity had a numerical limit, and when this was\npassed the emotion became another thing. Now, as he viewed them, he\nmerely felt himself very lucky, and beseeched the continuance of his\nsuperior fortune. At the passing of these slouched and stained figures\nhe now heard a reiteration of warning. A part of himself was appealing\nthrough the medium of these grim shapes. It was plucking at his sleeve\nand pointing, telling him to beware; and so it had come to pass that he\ncared for the implacable misery of these soldiers only as he would have\ncared for the harms of broken dolls. His whole vision was focussed\nupon his own chance.\n\nThe lieutenant suddenly halted. \"Look,\" he said. \"I find that my duty\nis in another direction. I must go another way. But if you wish to\nfight you have only to go forward, and any officer of the fighting\nline will give you opportunity.\" He raised his cap ceremoniously; Peza\nraised his new white helmet. The stranger to battles uttered thanks to\nhis chaperon, the one who had presented him. They bowed punctiliously,\nstaring at each other with civil eyes.\n\nThe lieutenant moved quietly away through a field. In an instant it\nflashed upon Peza's mind that this desertion was perfidious. He had\nbeen subjected to a criminal discourtesy. The officer had fetched him\ninto the middle of the thing, and then left him to wander helplessly\ntoward death. At one time he was upon the point of shouting at the\nofficer.\n\nIn the vale there was an effect as if one was then beneath the battle.\nIt was going on above somewhere. Alone, unguided, Peza felt like a\nman groping in a cellar. He reflected too that one should always see\nthe beginning of a fight. It was too difficult to thus approach it\nwhen the affair was in full swing. The trees hid all movements of\ntroops from him, and he thought he might be walking out to the very\nspot which chance had provided for the reception of a fool. He asked\neager questions of passing soldiers. Some paid no heed to him; others\nshook their heads mournfully. They knew nothing save that war was hard\nwork. If they talked at all it was in testimony of having fought well,\nsavagely. They did not know if the army was going to advance, hold its\nground, or retreat; they were weary.\n\nA long pointed shell flashed through the air and struck near the base\nof a tree, with a fierce upheaval, compounded of earth and flames.\nLooking back, Peza could see the shattered tree quivering from head\nto foot. Its whole being underwent a convulsive tremor which was an\nexhibition of pain, and, furthermore, deep amazement. As he advanced\nthrough the vale, the shells continued to hiss and hurtle in long low\nflights, and the bullets purred in the air. The missiles were flying\ninto the breast of an astounded nature. The landscape, bewildered,\nagonized, was suffering a rain of infamous shots, and Peza imagined a\nmillion eyes gazing at him with the gaze of startled antelopes.\n\nThere was a resolute crashing of musketry from the tall hill on the\nleft, and from directly in front there was a mingled din of artillery\nand musketry firing. Peza felt that his pride was playing a great trick\nin forcing him forward in this manner under conditions of strangeness,\nisolation, and ignorance. But he recalled the manner of the lieutenant,\nthe smile on the hill-top among the flying peasants. Peza blushed and\npulled the peak of his helmet down on his forehead. He strode onward\nfirmly. Nevertheless he hated the lieutenant, and he resolved that on\nsome future occasion he would take much trouble to arrange a stinging\nsocial revenge upon that grinning jackanapes. It did not occur to\nhim until later that he was now going to battle mainly because at a\nprevious time a certain man had smiled.\n\n\n                   IV\n\nThe road curved round the base of a little hill, and on this hill a\nbattery of mountain guns was leisurely shelling something unseen. In\nthe lee of the height the mules, contented under their heavy saddles,\nwere quietly browsing the long grass. Peza ascended the hill by a\nslanting path. He felt his heart beat swiftly; once at the top of\nthe hill he would be obliged to look this phenomenon in the face. He\nhurried, with a mysterious idea of preventing by this strategy the\nbattle from making his appearance a signal for some tremendous renewal.\nThis vague thought seemed logical at the time. Certainly this living\nthing had knowledge of his coming. He endowed it with the intelligence\nof a barbaric deity. And so he hurried; he wished to surprise war, this\nterrible emperor, when it was growling on its throne. The ferocious and\nhorrible sovereign was not to be allowed to make the arrival a pretext\nfor some fit of smoky rage and blood. In this half-lull, Peza had\ndistinctly the sense of stealing upon the battle unawares.\n\nThe soldiers watching the mules did not seem to be impressed by\nanything august. Two of them sat side by side and talked comfortably;\nanother lay flat upon his back staring dreamily at the sky; another\ncursed a mule for certain refractions. Despite their uniforms, their\nbandoliers and rifles, they were dwelling in the peace of hostlers.\nHowever, the long shells were whooping from time to time over the brow\nof the hill, and swirling in almost straight lines toward the vale of\ntrees, flowers, and grass. Peza, hearing and seeing the shells, and\nseeing the pensive guardians of the mules, felt reassured. They were\naccepting the condition of war as easily as an old sailor accepts\nthe chair behind the counter of a tobacco-shop. Or, it was merely\nthat the farm-boy had gone to sea, and he had adjusted himself to the\ncircumstances immediately, and with only the usual first misadventures\nin conduct. Peza was proud and ashamed that he was not of them, these\nstupid peasants, who, throughout the world, hold potentates on their\nthrones, make statesmen illustrious, provide generals with lasting\nvictories, all with ignorance, indifference, or half-witted hatred,\nmoving the world with the strength of their arms and getting their\nheads knocked together in the name of God, the king, or the Stock\nExchange; immortal, dreaming, hopeless asses who surrender their reason\nto the care of a shining puppet, and persuade some toy to carry their\nlives in his purse. Peza mentally abased himself before them, and\nwished to stir them with furious kicks.\n\nAs his eyes ranged above the rim of the plateau, he saw a group of\nartillery officers talking busily. They turned at once and regarded\nhis ascent. A moment later a row of infantry soldiers in a trench\nbeyond the little guns all faced him. Peza bowed to the officers. He\nunderstood at the time that he had made a good and cool bow, and he\nwondered at it, for his breath was coming in gasps, he was stifling\nfrom sheer excitement. He felt like a tipsy man trying to conceal his\nmuscular uncertainty from the people in the street. But the officers\ndid not display any knowledge. They bowed. Behind them Peza saw the\nplain, glittering green, with three lines of black marked upon it\nheavily. The front of the first of these lines was frothy with smoke.\nTo the left of this hill was a craggy mountain, from which came a\ncontinual dull rattle of musketry. Its summit was ringed with the white\nsmoke. The black lines on the plain slowly moved. The shells that came\nfrom there passed overhead with the sound of great birds frantically\nflapping their wings. Peza thought of the first sight of the sea during\na storm. He seemed to feel against his face the wind that races over\nthe tops of cold and tumultuous billows.\n\nHe heard a voice afar off--\"Sir, what would you?\" He turned, and saw\nthe dapper captain of the battery standing beside him. Only a moment\nhad elapsed. \"Pardon me, sir,\" said Peza, bowing again. The officer was\nevidently reserving his bows; he scanned the new-comer attentively.\n\"Are you a correspondent?\" he asked. Peza produced a card. \"Yes, I came\nas a correspondent,\" he replied, \"but now, sir, I have other thoughts.\nI wish to help. You see? I wish to help.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" said the captain. \"Are you a Greek? Do you wish to\nfight?\"\n\n\"Yes, I am a Greek. I wish to fight.\" Peza's voice surprised him\nby coming from his lips in even and deliberate tones. He thought\nwith gratification that he was behaving rather well. Another shell\ntravelling from some unknown point on the plain whirled close and\nfuriously in the air, pursuing an apparently horizontal course as if it\nwere never going to touch the earth. The dark shape swished across the\nsky.\n\n\"Ah,\" cried the captain, now smiling, \"I am not sure that we will be\nable to accommodate you with a fierce affair here just at this time,\nbut----\" He walked gaily to and fro behind the guns with Peza, pointing\nout to him the lines of the Greeks, and describing his opinion of the\ngeneral plan of defence. He wore the air of an amiable host. Other\nofficers questioned Peza in regard to the politics of the war. The\nking, the ministry, Germany, England, Russia, all these huge words\nwere continually upon their tongues. \"And the people in Athens? Were\nthey----\" Amid this vivacious babble Peza, seated upon an ammunition\nbox, kept his glance high, watching the appearance of shell after\nshell. These officers were like men who had been lost for days in the\nforest. They were thirsty for any scrap of news. Nevertheless, one of\nthem would occasionally dispute their informant courteously. What would\nServia have to say to that? No, no, France and Russia could never allow\nit. Peza was elated. The shells killed no one; war was not so bad. He\nwas simply having coffee in the smoking-room of some embassy where\nreverberate the names of nations.\n\nA rumour had passed along the motley line of privates in the trench.\nThe new arrival with the clean white helmet was a famous English\ncavalry officer come to assist the army with his counsel. They stared\nat the figure of him, surrounded by officers. Peza, gaining sense of\nthe glances and whispers, felt that his coming was an event.\n\nLater, he resolved that he could with temerity do something finer.\nHe contemplated the mountain where the Greek infantry was engaged,\nand announced leisurely to the captain of the battery that he thought\npresently of going in that direction and getting into the fight. He\nre-affirmed the sentiments of a patriot. The captain seemed surprised.\n\"Oh, there will be fighting here at this knoll in a few minutes,\" he\nsaid orientally. \"That will be sufficient? You had better stay with us.\nBesides, I have been ordered to resume fire.\" The officers all tried to\ndissuade him from departing. It was really not worth the trouble. The\nbattery would begin again directly. Then it would be amusing for him.\n\nPeza felt that he was wandering with his protestations of high\npatriotism through a desert of sensible men. These officers gave no\nheed to his exalted declarations. They seemed too jaded. They were\nfighting the men who were fighting them. Palaver of the particular kind\nhad subsided before their intense pre-occupation in war as a craft.\nMoreover, many men had talked in that manner and only talked.\n\nPeza believed at first that they were treating him delicately. They\nwere considerate of his inexperience. War had turned out to be such a\ngentle business that Peza concluded he could scorn this idea. He bade\nthem a heroic farewell despite their objections.\n\nHowever, when he reflected upon their ways afterward, he saw dimly that\nthey were actuated principally by some universal childish desire for a\nspectator of their fine things. They were going into action, and they\nwished to be seen at war, precise and fearless.\n\n\n                   V\n\nClimbing slowly to the high infantry position, Peza was amazed to\nmeet a soldier whose jaw had been half shot away, and who was being\nhelped down the sheep track by two tearful comrades. The man's breast\nwas drenched with blood, and from a cloth which he held to the wound\ndrops were splashing wildly upon the stones of the path. He gazed at\nPeza for a moment. It was a mystic gaze, which Peza withstood with\ndifficulty. He was exchanging looks with a spectre; all aspect of the\nman was somehow gone from this victim. As Peza went on, one of the\nunwounded soldiers loudly shouted to him to return and assist in this\ntragic march. But even Peza's fingers revolted; he was afraid of the\nspectre; he would not have dared to touch it. He was surely craven in\nthe movement of refusal he made to them. He scrambled hastily on up the\npath. He was running away.\n\nAt the top of the hill he came immediately upon a part of the line that\nwas in action. Another battery of mountain guns was here firing at the\nstreaks of black on the plain. There were trenches filled with men\nlining parts of the crest, and near the base were other trenches, all\ncrashing away mightily. The plain stretched as far as the eye can see,\nand from where silver mist ended this emerald ocean of grass, a great\nridge of snow-topped mountains poised against a fleckless blue sky. Two\nknolls, green and yellow with grain, sat on the prairie confronting the\ndark hills of the Greek position. Between them were the lines of the\nenemy. A row of trees, a village, a stretch of road, showed faintly\non this great canvas, this tremendous picture, but men, the Turkish\nbattalions, were emphasized startlingly upon it. The ranks of troops\nbetween the knolls and the Greek position were as black as ink.\n\nThe first line of course was muffled in smoke, but at the rear of it\nbattalions crawled up and to and fro plainer than beetles on a plate.\nPeza had never understood that masses of men were so declarative, so\nunmistakable, as if nature makes every arrangement to give information\nof the coming and the presence of destruction, the end, oblivion. The\nfiring was full, complete, a roar of cataracts, and this pealing of\nconnected volleys was adjusted to the grandeur of the far-off range of\nsnowy mountains. Peza, breathless, pale, felt that he had been set upon\na pillar and was surveying mankind, the world. In the meantime dust had\ngot in his eye. He took his handkerchief and mechanically administered\nto it.\n\nAn officer with a double stripe of purple on his trousers paced in the\nrear of the battery of howitzers. He waved a little cane. Sometimes\nhe paused in his promenade to study the field through his glasses. \"A\nfine scene, sir,\" he cried airily, upon the approach of Peza. It was\nlike a blow in the chest to the wide-eyed volunteer. It revealed to him\na point of view. \"Yes, sir, it is a fine scene,\" he answered. They\nspoke in French. \"I am happy to be able to entertain monsieur with a\nlittle practice,\" continued the officer. \"I am firing upon that mass of\ntroops you see there a little to the right. They are probably forming\nfor another attack.\" Peza smiled; here again appeared manners, manners\nerect by the side of death.\n\nThe right-flank gun of the battery thundered; there was a belch of\nfire and smoke; the shell flung swiftly and afar was known only to the\near in which rang a broadening hooting wake of sound. The howitzer had\nthrown itself backward convulsively, and lay with its wheels moving\nin the air as a squad of men rushed toward it. And later, it seemed\nas if each little gun had made the supreme effort of its being in\neach particular shot. They roared with voices far too loud, and the\nthunderous effort caused a gun to bound as in a dying convulsion. And\nthen occasionally one was hurled with wheels in air. These shuddering\nhowitzers presented an appearance of so many cowards always longing to\nbolt to the rear, but being implacably held to their business by this\nthrong of soldiers who ran in squads to drag them up again to their\nobligation. The guns were herded and cajoled and bullied interminably.\nOne by one, in relentless program, they were dragged forward to\ncontribute a profound vibration of steel and wood, a flash and a roar,\nto the important happiness of man.\n\nThe adjacent infantry celebrated a good shot with smiles and an\noutburst of gleeful talk.\n\n\"Look, sir,\" cried an officer to Peza. Thin smoke was drifting lazily\nbefore Peza, and dodging impatiently he brought his eyes to bear upon\nthat part of the plain indicated by the officer's finger. The enemy's\ninfantry was advancing to attack. From the black lines had come forth\nan inky mass which was shaped much like a human tongue. It advanced\nslowly, casually, without apparent spirit, but with an insolent\nconfidence that was like a proclamation of the inevitable.\n\nThe impetuous part was all played by the defensive side. Officers\ncalled, men plucked each other by the sleeve; there were shouts,\nmotions, all eyes were turned upon the inky mass which was flowing\ntoward the base of the hills, heavily, languorously, as oily and thick\nas one of the streams that ooze through a swamp.\n\nPeza was chattering a question at every one. In the way, pushed aside,\nor in the way again, he continued to repeat it. \"Can they take the\nposition? Can they take the position? Can they take the position?\"\nHe was apparently addressing an assemblage of deaf men. Every eye\nwas busy watching every hand. The soldiers did not even seem to see\nthe interesting stranger in the white helmet who was crying out so\nfeverishly.\n\nFinally, however, the hurried captain of the battery espied him and\nheeded his question. \"No, sir! no, sir! It is impossible,\" he shouted\nangrily. His manner seemed to denote that if he had sufficient time he\nwould have completely insulted Peza. The latter swallowed the crumb of\nnews without regard to the coating of scorn, and, waving his hand in\nadieu, he began to run along the crest of the hill toward the part of\nthe Greek line against which the attack was directed.\n\n\n                   VI\n\nPeza, as he ran along the crest of the mountain, believed that his\naction was receiving the wrathful attention of the hosts of the foe.\nTo him then it was incredible foolhardiness thus to call to himself\nthe stares of thousands of hateful eyes. He was like a lad induced by\nplaymates to commit some indiscretion in a cathedral. He was abashed;\nperhaps he even blushed as he ran. It seemed to him that the whole\nsolemn ceremony of war had paused during this commission. So he\nscrambled wildly over the rocks in his haste to end the embarrassing\nordeal. When he came among the crowning rifle-pits filled with eager\nsoldiers he wanted to yell with joy. None noticed him save a young\nofficer of infantry, who said--\"Sir, what do you want?\" It was obvious\nthat people had devoted some attention to their own affairs.\n\nPeza asserted, in Greek, that he wished above everything to battle for\nthe fatherland. The officer nodded; with a smile he pointed to some\ndead men covered with blankets, from which were thrust upturned dusty\nshoes.\n\n\"Yes, I know, I know,\" cried Peza. He thought the officer was\npoetically alluding to the danger.\n\n\"No,\" said the officer at once. \"I mean cartridges--a bandolier. Take\na bandolier from one of them.\"\n\nPeza went cautiously toward a body. He moved a hand toward the corner\nof a blanket. There he hesitated, stuck, as if his arm had turned to\nplaster. Hearing a rustle behind him he spun quickly. Three soldiers of\nthe close rank in the trench were regarding him. The officer came again\nand tapped him on the shoulder. \"Have you any tobacco?\" Peza looked at\nhim in bewilderment. His hand was still extended toward the blanket\nwhich covered the dead soldier. \"Yes,\" he said, \"I have some tobacco.\"\nHe gave the officer his pouch. As if in compensation, the other\ndirected a soldier to strip the bandolier from the corpse. Peza, having\ncrossed the long cartridge belt on his breast, felt that the dead man\nhad flung his two arms around him.\n\nA soldier with a polite nod and smile gave Peza a rifle, a relic of\nanother dead man. Thus, he felt, besides the clutch of a corpse about\nhis neck, that the rifle was as inhumanly horrible as a snake that\nlives in a tomb. He heard at his ear something that was in effect like\nthe voices of those two dead men, their low voices speaking to him\nof bloody death, mutilation. The bandolier gripped him tighter; he\nwished to raise his hands to his throat like a man who is choking. The\nrifle was clammy; upon his palms he felt the movement of the sluggish\ncurrents of a serpent's life; it was crawling and frightful.\n\nAll about him were these peasants, with their interested countenances,\ngibbering of the fight. From time to time a soldier cried out in\nsemi-humorous lamentations descriptive of his thirst. One bearded man\nsat munching a great bit of hard bread. Fat, greasy, squat, he was like\nan idol made of tallow. Peza felt dimly that there was a distinction\nbetween this man and a young student who could write sonnets and play\nthe piano quite well. This old blockhead was coolly gnawing at the\nbread, while he, Peza, was being throttled by a dead man's arms.\n\nHe looked behind him, and saw that a head by some chance had been\nuncovered from its blanket. Two liquid-like eyes were staring into\nhis face. The head was turned a little sideways as if to get better\nopportunity for the scrutiny. Peza could feel himself blanch; he was\nbeing drawn and drawn by these dead men slowly, firmly down as to some\nmystic chamber under the earth where they could walk, dreadful figures,\nswollen and blood-marked. He was bidden; they had commanded him; he was\ngoing, going, going.\n\nWhen the man in the new white helmet bolted for the rear, many of the\nsoldiers in the trench thought that he had been struck, but those\nwho had been nearest to him knew better. Otherwise they would have\nheard the silken sliding tender noise of the bullet and the thud\nof its impact. They bawled after him curses, and also outbursts of\nself-congratulation and vanity. Despite the prominence of the cowardly\npart, they were enabled to see in this exhibition a fine comment upon\ntheir own fortitude. The other soldiers thought that Peza had been\nwounded somewhere in the neck, because as he ran he was tearing madly\nat the bandolier, the dead man's arms. The soldier with the bread\npaused in his eating and cynically remarked upon the speed of the\nrunaway.\n\nAn officer's voice was suddenly heard calling out the calculation of\nthe distance to the enemy, the readjustment of the sights. There was\na stirring rattle along the line. The men turned their eyes to the\nfront. Other trenches beneath them to the right were already heavily in\naction. The smoke was lifting toward the blue sky. The soldier with the\nbread placed it carefully on a bit of paper beside him as he turned to\nkneel in the trench.\n\n\n                   VII\n\nIn the late afternoon, the child ceased his play on the mountain with\nhis flocks and his dogs. Part of the battle had whirled very near to\nthe base of his hill, and the noise was great. Sometimes he could see\nfantastic smoky shapes which resembled the curious figures in foam\nwhich one sees on the slant of a rough sea. The plain indeed was etched\nin white circles and whirligigs like the slope of a colossal wave. The\nchild took seat on a stone and contemplated the fight. He was beginning\nto be astonished; he had never before seen cattle herded with such\nuproar. Lines of flame flashed out here and there. It was mystery.\n\nFinally, without any preliminary indication, he began to weep. If the\nmen struggling on the plain had had time and greater vision, they could\nhave seen this strange tiny figure seated on a boulder, surveying them\nwhile the tears streamed. It was as simple as some powerful symbol.\n\nAs the magic clear light of day amid the mountains dimmed the\ndistances, and the plain shone as a pallid blue cloth marked by the red\nthreads of the firing, the child arose and moved off to the unwelcoming\ndoor of his home. He called softly for his mother, and complained of\nhis hunger in the familiar formula. The pearl-coloured cow, grinding\nher jaws thoughtfully, stared at him with her large eyes. The peaceful\ngloom of evening was slowly draping the hills.\n\nThe child heard a rattle of loose stones on the hillside, and facing\nthe sound, saw a moment later a man drag himself up to the crest of the\nhill and fall panting. Forgetting his mother and his hunger, filled\nwith calm interest, the child walked forward and stood over the heaving\nform. His eyes too were now large and inscrutably wise and sad like\nthose of the animal in the house.\n\nAfter a silence he spoke inquiringly. \"Are you a man?\"\n\nPeza rolled over quickly and gazed up into the fearless cherubic\ncountenance. He did not attempt to reply. He breathed as if life was\nabout to leave his body. He was covered with dust; his face had been\ncut in some way, and his cheek was ribboned with blood. All the spick\nof his former appearance had vanished in a general dishevelment, in\nwhich he resembled a creature that had been flung to and fro, up and\ndown, by cliffs and prairies during an earthquake. He rolled his eye\nglassily at the child.\n\nThey remained thus until the child repeated his words. \"Are you a man?\"\n\nPeza gasped in the manner of a fish. Palsied, windless, and abject, he\nconfronted the primitive courage, the sovereign child, the brother of\nthe mountains, the sky and the sea, and he knew that the definition of\nhis misery could be written on a grass-blade.\n\n\n\n\n                  Part II\n\n             Midnight Sketches\n\n\n\n\n          AN EXPERIMENT IN MISERY\n\n        (From the Press, New York.)\n\n\nIt was late at night, and a fine rain was swirling softly down, causing\nthe pavements to glisten with hue of steel and blue and yellow in the\nrays of the innumerable lights. A youth was trudging slowly, without\nenthusiasm, with his hands buried deep in his trouser's pockets,\ntowards the down-town places where beds can be hired for coppers. He\nwas clothed in an aged and tattered suit, and his derby was a marvel\nof dust-covered crown and torn rim. He was going forth to eat as the\nwanderer may eat, and sleep as the homeless sleep. By the time he had\nreached City Hall Park he was so completely plastered with yells of\n\"bum\" and \"hobo,\" and with various unholy epithets that small boys\nhad applied to him at intervals, that he was in a state of the most\nprofound dejection. The sifting rain saturated the old velvet collar of\nhis overcoat, and as the wet cloth pressed against his neck, he felt\nthat there no longer could be pleasure in life. He looked about him\nsearching for an outcast of highest degree that they too might share\nmiseries, but the lights threw a quivering glare over rows and circles\nof deserted benches that glistened damply, showing patches of wet sod\nbehind them. It seemed that their usual freights had fled on this night\nto better things. There were only squads of well-dressed Brooklyn\npeople who swarmed towards the bridge.\n\nThe young man loitered about for a time and then went shuffling off\ndown Park Row. In the sudden descent in style of the dress of the crowd\nhe felt relief, and as if he were at last in his own country. He began\nto see tatters that matched his tatters. In Chatham Square there were\naimless men strewn in front of saloons and lodging-houses, standing\nsadly, patiently, reminding one vaguely of the attitudes of chickens in\na storm. He aligned himself with these men, and turned slowly to occupy\nhimself with the flowing life of the great street.\n\nThrough the mists of the cold and storming night, the cable cars went\nin silent procession, great affairs shining with red and brass, moving\nwith formidable power, calm and irresistible, dangerful and gloomy,\nbreaking silence only by the loud fierce cry of the gong. Two rivers of\npeople swarmed along the side walks, spattered with black mud, which\nmade each shoe leave a scar-like impression. Overhead elevated trains\nwith a shrill grinding of the wheels stopped at the station, which upon\nits leg-like pillars seemed to resemble some monstrous kind of crab\nsquatting over the street. The quick fat puffings of the engines could\nbe heard. Down an alley there were sombre curtains of purple and black,\non which street lamps dully glittered like embroidered flowers.\n\nA saloon stood with a voracious air on a corner. A sign leaning against\nthe front of the door-post announced \"Free hot soup to-night!\" The\nswing doors, snapping to and fro like ravenous lips, made gratified\nsmacks as the saloon gorged itself with plump men, eating with\nastounding and endless appetite, smiling in some indescribable manner\nas the men came from all directions like sacrifices to a heathenish\nsuperstition.\n\nCaught by the delectable sign the young man allowed himself to be\nswallowed. A bar-tender placed a schooner of dark and portentous beer\non the bar. Its monumental form up-reared until the froth a-top was\nabove the crown of the young man's brown derby.\n\n\"Soup over there, gents,\" said the bar-tender affably. A little yellow\nman in rags and the youth grasped their schooners and went with speed\ntoward a lunch counter, where a man with oily but imposing whiskers\nladled genially from a kettle until he had furnished his two mendicants\nwith a soup that was steaming hot, and in which there were little\nfloating suggestions of chicken. The young man, sipping his broth, felt\nthe cordiality expressed by the warmth of the mixture, and he beamed\nat the man with oily but imposing whiskers, who was presiding like a\npriest behind an altar. \"Have some more, gents?\" he inquired of the two\nsorry figures before him. The little yellow man accepted with a swift\ngesture, but the youth shook his head and went out, following a man\nwhose wondrous seediness promised that he would have a knowledge of\ncheap lodging-houses.\n\nOn the side-walk he accosted the seedy man. \"Say, do you know a cheap\nplace to sleep?\"\n\nThe other hesitated for a time gazing sideways. Finally he nodded in\nthe direction of the street, \"I sleep up there,\" he said, \"when I've\ngot the price.\"\n\n\"How much?\"\n\n\"Ten cents.\"\n\nThe young man shook his head dolefully. \"That's too rich for me.\"\n\nAt that moment there approached the two a reeling man in strange\ngarments. His head was a fuddle of bushy hair and whiskers, from\nwhich his eyes peered with a guilty slant. In a close scrutiny it was\npossible to distinguish the cruel lines of a mouth which looked as if\nits lips had just closed with satisfaction over some tender and piteous\nmorsel. He appeared like an assassin steeped in crimes performed\nawkwardly.\n\nBut at this time his voice was tuned to the coaxing key of an\naffectionate puppy. He looked at the men with wheedling eyes, and began\nto sing a little melody for charity.\n\n\"Say, gents, can't yeh give a poor feller a couple of cents t' git a\nbed. I got five, and I gits anudder two I gits me a bed. Now, on th'\nsquare, gents, can't yeh jest gimme two cents t' git a bed? Now, yeh\nknow how a respecter'ble gentlem'n feels when he's down on his luck,\nan' I----\"\n\nThe seedy man, staring with imperturbable countenance at a train which\nclattered overhead, interrupted in an expressionless voice--\"Ah, go t'\nh--!\"\n\nBut the youth spoke to the prayerful assassin in tones of astonishment\nand inquiry. \"Say, you must be crazy! Why don't yeh strike somebody\nthat looks as if they had money?\"\n\nThe assassin, tottering about on his uncertain legs, and at intervals\nbrushing imaginary obstacles from before his nose, entered into a long\nexplanation of the psychology of the situation. It was so profound that\nit was unintelligible.\n\nWhen he had exhausted the subject, the young man said to him--\n\n\"Let's see th' five cents.\"\n\nThe assassin wore an expression of drunken woe at this sentence, filled\nwith suspicion of him. With a deeply pained air he began to fumble in\nhis clothing, his red hands trembling. Presently he announced in a\nvoice of bitter grief, as if he had been betrayed--\"There's on'y four.\"\n\n\"Four,\" said the young man thoughtfully. \"Well, look-a-here, I'm a\nstranger here, an' if ye'll steer me to your cheap joint I'll find the\nother three.\"\n\nThe assassin's countenance became instantly radiant with joy. His\nwhiskers quivered with the wealth of his alleged emotions. He seized\nthe young man's hand in a transport of delight and friendliness.\n\n\"B' Gawd,\" he cried, \"if ye'll do that, b' Gawd, I'd say yeh was a\ndamned good fellow, I would, an' I'd remember yeh all m' life, I would,\nb' Gawd, an' if I ever got a chance I'd return the compliment\"--he\nspoke with drunken dignity,--\"b' Gawd, I'd treat yeh white, I would,\nan' I'd allus remember yeh.\"\n\nThe young man drew back, looking at the assassin coldly. \"Oh, that's\nall right,\" he said. \"You show me th' joint--that's all you've got t'\ndo.\"\n\nThe assassin, gesticulating gratitude, led the young man along a dark\nstreet. Finally he stopped before a little dusty door. He raised his\nhand impressively. \"Look-a-here,\" he said, and there was a thrill of\ndeep and ancient wisdom upon his face, \"I've brought yeh here, an'\nthat's my part, ain't it? If th' place don't suit yeh, yeh needn't git\nmad at me, need yeh? There won't be no bad feelin', will there?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the young man.\n\nThe assassin waved his arm tragically, and led the march up the\nsteep stairway. On the way the young man furnished the assassin with\nthree pennies. At the top a man with benevolent spectacles looked at\nthem through a hole in a board. He collected their money, wrote some\nnames on a register, and speedily was leading the two men along a\ngloom-shrouded corridor.\n\nShortly after the beginning of this journey the young man felt his\nliver turn white, for from the dark and secret places of the building\nthere suddenly came to his nostrils strange and unspeakable odours,\nthat assailed him like malignant diseases with wings. They seemed to\nbe from human bodies closely packed in dens; the exhalations from\na hundred pairs of reeking lips; the fumes from a thousand bygone\ndebauches; the expression of a thousand present miseries.\n\nA man, naked save for a little snuff-coloured undershirt, was parading\nsleepily along the corridor. He rubbed his eyes, and, giving vent to a\nprodigious yawn, demanded to be told the time.\n\n\"Half-past one.\"\n\nThe man yawned again. He opened a door, and for a moment his form was\noutlined against a black, opaque interior. To this door came the three\nmen, and as it was again opened the unholy odours rushed out like\nfiends, so that the young man was obliged to struggle as against an\noverpowering wind.\n\nIt was some time before the youth's eyes were good in the intense gloom\nwithin, but the man with benevolent spectacles led him skilfully,\npausing but a moment to deposit the limp assassin upon a cot. He took\nthe youth to a cot that lay tranquilly by the window, and showing him a\ntall locker for clothes that stood near the head with the ominous air\nof a tombstone, left him.\n\nThe youth sat on his cot and peered about him. There was a gas-jet in\na distant part of the room, that burned a small flickering orange-hued\nflame. It caused vast masses of tumbled shadows in all parts of the\nplace, save where, immediately about it, there was a little grey haze.\nAs the young man's eyes became used to the darkness, he could see upon\nthe cots that thickly littered the floor the forms of men sprawled out,\nlying in death-like silence, or heaving and snoring with tremendous\neffort, like stabbed fish.\n\nThe youth locked his derby and his shoes in the mummy case near him,\nand then lay down with an old and familiar coat around his shoulders.\nA blanket he handed gingerly, drawing it over part of the coat. The\ncot was covered with leather, and as cold as melting snow. The youth\nwas obliged to shiver for some time on this affair, which was like a\nslab. Presently, however, his chill gave him peace, and during this\nperiod of leisure from it he turned his head to stare at his friend the\nassassin, whom he could dimly discern where he lay sprawled on a cot in\nthe abandon of a man filled with drink. He was snoring with incredible\nvigour. His wet hair and beard dimly glistened, and his inflamed nose\nshone with subdued lustre like a red light in a fog.\n\nWithin reach of the youth's hand was one who lay with yellow breast and\nshoulders bare to the cold drafts. One arm hung over the side of the\ncot, and the fingers lay full length upon the wet cement floor of the\nroom. Beneath the inky brows could be seen the eyes of the man exposed\nby the partly opened lids. To the youth it seemed that he and this\ncorpse-like being were exchanging a prolonged stare, and that the other\nthreatened with his eyes. He drew back watching his neighbour from the\nshadows of his blanket edge. The man did not move once through the\nnight, but lay in this stillness as of death like a body stretched out\nexpectant of the surgeon's knife.\n\nAnd all through the room could be seen the tawny hues of naked flesh,\nlimbs thrust into the darkness, projecting beyond the cots; upreared\nknees, arms hanging long and thin over the cot edges. For the most part\nthey were statuesque, carven, dead. With the curious lockers standing\nall about like tombstones, there was a strange effect of a graveyard\nwhere bodies were merely flung.\n\nYet occasionally could be seen limbs wildly tossing in fantastic\nnightmare gestures, accompanied by guttural cries, grunts, oaths. And\nthere was one fellow off in a gloomy corner, who in his dreams was\noppressed by some frightful calamity, for of a sudden he began to utter\nlong wails that went almost like yells from a hound, echoing wailfully\nand weird through this chill place of tombstones where men lay like the\ndead.\n\nThe sound in its high piercing beginnings, that dwindled to final\nmelancholy moans, expressed a red and grim tragedy of the unfathomable\npossibilities of the man's dreams. But to the youth these were not\nmerely the shrieks of a vision-pierced man: they were an utterance of\nthe meaning of the room and its occupants. It was to him the protest\nof the wretch who feels the touch of the imperturbable granite wheels,\nand who then cries with an impersonal eloquence, with a strength not\nfrom him, giving voice to the wail of a whole section, a class, a\npeople. This, weaving into the young man's brain, and mingling with his\nviews of the vast and sombre shadows that, like mighty black fingers,\ncurled around the naked bodies, made the young man so that he did not\nsleep, but lay carving the biographies for these men from his meagre\nexperience. At times the fellow in the corner howled in a writhing\nagony of his imaginations.\n\nFinally a long lance-point of grey light shot through the dusty panes\nof the window. Without, the young man could see roofs drearily white\nin the dawning. The point of light yellowed and grew brighter, until\nthe golden rays of the morning sun came in bravely and strong. They\ntouched with radiant colour the form of a small fat man, who snored\nin stuttering fashion. His round and shiny bald head glowed suddenly\nwith the valour of a decoration. He sat up, blinked at the sun, swore\nfretfully, and pulled his blanket over the ornamental splendours of his\nhead.\n\nThe youth contentedly watched this rout of the shadows before the\nbright spears of the sun, and presently he slumbered. When he awoke\nhe heard the voice of the assassin raised in valiant curses. Putting\nup his head, he perceived his comrade seated on the side of the cot\nengaged in scratching his neck with long finger-nails that rasped like\nfiles.\n\n\"Hully Jee, dis is a new breed. They've got can-openers on their feet.\"\nHe continued in a violent tirade.\n\nThe young man hastily unlocked his closet and took out his shoes\nand hat. As he sat on the side of the cot lacing his shoes, he\nglanced about and saw that daylight had made the room comparatively\ncommon-place and uninteresting. The men, whose faces seemed stolid,\nserene or absent, were engaged in dressing, while a great crackle of\nbantering conversation arose.\n\nA few were parading in unconcerned nakedness. Here and there were men\nof brawn, whose skins shone clear and ruddy. They took splendid poses,\nstanding massively like chiefs. When they had dressed in their ungainly\ngarments there was an extraordinary change. They then showed bumps and\ndeficiencies of all kinds.\n\nThere were others who exhibited many deformities. Shoulders were\nslanting, humped, pulled this way and pulled that way. And notable\namong these latter men was the little fat man, who had refused to allow\nhis head to be glorified. His pudgy form, builded like a pear, bustled\nto and fro, while he swore in fish-wife fashion. It appeared that some\narticle of his apparel had vanished.\n\nThe young man attired speedily, and went to his friend the assassin.\nAt first the latter looked dazed at the sight of the youth. This face\nseemed to be appealing to him through the cloud wastes of his memory.\nHe scratched his neck and reflected. At last he grinned, a broad smile\ngradually spreading until his countenance was a round illumination.\n\"Hello, Willie,\" he cried cheerily.\n\n\"Hello,\" said the young man. \"Are yeh ready t' fly?\"\n\n\"Sure.\" The assassin tied his shoe carefully with some twine and came\nambling.\n\nWhen he reached the street the young man experienced no sudden relief\nfrom unholy atmospheres. He had forgotten all about them, and had been\nbreathing naturally, and with no sensation of discomfort or distress.\n\nHe was thinking of these things as he walked along the street, when he\nwas suddenly startled by feeling the assassin's hand, trembling with\nexcitement, clutching his arm, and when the assassin spoke, his voice\nwent into quavers from a supreme agitation.\n\n\"I'll be hully, bloomin' blowed if there wasn't a feller with a\nnightshirt on up there in that joint.\"\n\nThe youth was bewildered for a moment, but presently he turned to smile\nindulgently at the assassin's humour.\n\n\"Oh, you're a d----d liar,\" he merely said.\n\nWhereupon the assassin began to gesture extravagantly, and take oath by\nstrange gods. He frantically placed himself at the mercy of remarkable\nfates if his tale were not true.\n\n\"Yes, he did! I cross m'heart thousan' times!\" he protested, and at\nthe moment his eyes were large with amazement, his mouth wrinkled in\nunnatural glee.\n\n\"Yessir! A nightshirt! A hully white nightshirt!\"\n\n\"You lie!\"\n\n\"No, sir! I hope ter die b'fore I kin git anudder ball if there wasn't\na jay wid a hully, bloomin' white nightshirt!\"\n\nHis face was filled with the infinite wonder of it. \"A hully white\nnightshirt,\" he continually repeated.\n\nThe young man saw the dark entrance to a basement restaurant. There was\na sign which read \"No mystery about our hash!\" and there were other\nage-stained and world-battered legends which told him that the place\nwas within his means. He stopped before it and spoke to the assassin.\n\"I guess I'll git somethin' t' eat.\"\n\nAt this the assassin, for some reason, appeared to be quite\nembarrassed. He gazed at the seductive front of the eating place for a\nmoment. Then he started slowly up the street. \"Well, good-bye, Willie,\"\nhe said bravely.\n\nFor an instant the youth studied the departing figure. Then he called\nout, \"Hol' on a minnet.\" As they came together he spoke in a certain\nfierce way, as if he feared that the other would think him to be\ncharitable. \"Look-a-here, if yeh wanta git some breakfas' I'll lend\nyeh three cents t' do it with. But say, look-a-here, you've gota git\nout an' hustle. I ain't goin' t' support yeh, or I'll go broke b'fore\nnight. I ain't no millionaire.\"\n\n\"I take me oath, Willie,\" said the assassin earnestly, \"th' on'y thing\nI really needs is a ball. Me t'roat feels like a fryin'-pan. But as I\ncan't get a ball, why, th' next bes' thing is breakfast, an' if yeh do\nthat for me, b' Gawd, I say yeh was th' whitest lad I ever see.\"\n\nThey spent a few moments in dexterous exchanges of phrases, in which\nthey each protested that the other was, as the assassin had originally\nsaid, \"a respecter'ble gentlem'n.\" And they concluded with mutual\nassurances that they were the souls of intelligence and virtue. Then\nthey went into the restaurant.\n\nThere was a long counter, dimly lighted from hidden sources. Two or\nthree men in soiled white aprons rushed here and there.\n\nThe youth bought a bowl of coffee for two cents and a roll for one\ncent. The assassin purchased the same. The bowls were webbed with brown\nseams, and the tin spoons wore an air of having emerged from the first\npyramid. Upon them were black moss-like encrustations of age, and they\nwere bent and scarred from the attacks of long-forgotten teeth. But\nover their repast the wanderers waxed warm and mellow. The assassin\ngrew affable as the hot mixture went soothingly down his parched\nthroat, and the young man felt courage flow in his veins.\n\nMemories began to throng in on the assassin, and he brought forth long\ntales, intricate, incoherent, delivered with a chattering swiftness as\nfrom an old woman. \"---- great job out'n Orange. Boss keep yeh hustlin'\nthough all time. I was there three days, and then I went an' ask 'im t'\nlend me a dollar. 'G-g-go ter the devil,' he ses, an' I lose me job.\"\n\n\"South no good. Damn niggers work for twenty-five an' thirty cents a\nday. Run white man out. Good grub though. Easy livin'.\"\n\n\"Yas; useter work little in Toledo, raftin' logs. Make two or three\ndollars er day in the spring. Lived high. Cold as ice though in the\nwinter.\"\n\n\"I was raised in northern N'York. O-o-oh, yeh jest oughto live there.\nNo beer ner whisky though, way off in the woods. But all th' good hot\ngrub yeh can eat. B' Gawd, I hung around there long as I could till\nth' ol' man fired me. 'Git t' hell outa here, yeh wuthless skunk, git\nt' hell outa here, an' go die,' he ses. 'You're a hell of a father,' I\nses, 'you are,' an' I quit 'im.\"\n\nAs they were passing from the dim eating place, they encountered an old\nman who was trying to steal forth with a tiny package of food, but a\ntall man with an indomitable moustache stood dragon fashion, barring\nthe way of escape. They heard the old man raise a plaintive protest.\n\"Ah, you always want to know what I take out, and you never see that I\nusually bring a package in here from my place of business.\"\n\nAs the wanderers trudged slowly along Park Row, the assassin began to\nexpand and grow blithe. \"B' Gawd, we've been livin' like kings,\" he\nsaid, smacking appreciative lips.\n\n\"Look out, or we'll have t' pay fer it t'night,\" said the youth with\ngloomy warning.\n\nBut the assassin refused to turn his gaze toward the future. He went\nwith a limping step, into which he injected a suggestion of lamblike\ngambols. His mouth was wreathed in a red grin.\n\nIn the City Hall Park the two wanderers sat down in the little circle\nof benches sanctified by traditions of their class. They huddled in\ntheir old garments, slumbrously conscious of the march of the hours\nwhich for them had no meaning.\n\nThe people of the street hurrying hither and thither made a blend of\nblack figures changing yet frieze-like. They walked in their good\nclothes as upon important missions, giving no gaze to the two wanderers\nseated upon the benches. They expressed to the young man his infinite\ndistance from all that he valued. Social position, comfort, the\npleasures of living, were unconquerable kingdoms. He felt a sudden awe.\n\nAnd in the background a multitude of buildings, of pitiless hues and\nsternly high, were to him emblematic of a nation forcing its regal\nhead into the clouds, throwing no downward glances; in the sublimity\nof its aspirations ignoring the wretches who may flounder at its feet.\nThe roar of the city in his ear was to him the confusion of strange\ntongues, babbling heedlessly; it was the clink of coin, the voice of\nthe city's hopes which were to him no hopes.\n\nHe confessed himself an outcast, and his eyes from under the lowered\nrim of his hat began to glance guiltily, wearing the criminal\nexpression that comes with certain convictions.\n\n\n\n\n          THE MEN IN THE STORM\n\n\nThe blizzard began to swirl great clouds of snow along the streets,\nsweeping it down from the roofs, and up from the pavements, until\nthe faces of pedestrians tingled and burned as from a thousand\nneedle-prickings. Those on the walks huddled their necks closely in the\ncollars of their coats, and went along stooping like a race of aged\npeople. The drivers of vehicles hurried their horses furiously on their\nway. They were made more cruel by the exposure of their position, aloft\non high seats. The street cars, bound up town, went slowly, the horses\nslipping and straining in the spongy brown mass that lay between the\nrails. The drivers, muffled to the eyes, stood erect, facing the wind,\nmodels of grim philosophy. Overhead trains rumbled and roared, and the\ndark structure of the elevated railroad, stretching over the avenue,\ndripped little streams and drops of water upon the mud and snow beneath.\n\nAll the clatter of the street was softened by the masses that lay upon\nthe cobbles, until, even to one who looked from a window, it became\nimportant music, a melody of life made necessary to the ear by the\ndreariness of the pitiless beat and sweep of the storm. Occasionally\none could see black figures of men busily shovelling the white drifts\nfrom the walks. The sounds from their labour created new recollections\nof rural experiences which every man manages to have in a measure.\nLater, the immense windows of the shops became aglow with light,\nthrowing great beams of orange and yellow upon the pavement. They\nwere infinitely cheerful, yet in a way they accentuated the force and\ndiscomfort of the storm, and gave a meaning to the pace of the people\nand the vehicles, scores of pedestrians and drivers, wretched with\ncold faces, necks and feet, speeding for scores of unknown doors and\nentrances, scattering to an infinite variety of shelters, to places\nwhich the imagination made warm with the familiar colours of home.\n\nThere was an absolute expression of hot dinners in the pace of the\npeople. If one dared to speculate upon the destination of those who\ncame trooping, he lost himself in a maze of social calculation; he\nmight fling a handful of sand and attempt to follow the flight of each\nparticular grain. But as to the suggestion of hot dinners, he was in\nfirm lines of thought, for it was upon every hurrying face. It is a\nmatter of tradition; it is from the tales of childhood. It comes forth\nwith every storm.\n\nHowever, in a certain part of a dark west-side street, there was a\ncollection of men to whom these things were as if they were not. In\nthis street was located a charitable house, where for five cents the\nhomeless of the city could get a bed at night, and in the morning\ncoffee and bread.\n\nDuring the afternoon of the storm, the whirling snows acted as drivers,\nas men with whips, and at half-past three the walk before the closed\ndoors of the house was covered with wanderers of the street, waiting.\nFor some distance on either side of the place they could be seen\nlurking in the doorways and behind projecting parts of buildings,\ngathering in close bunches in an effort to get warm. A covered wagon\ndrawn up near the curb sheltered a dozen of them. Under the stairs\nthat led to the elevated railway station, there were six or eight,\ntheir hands stuffed deep in their pockets, their shoulders stooped,\njiggling their feet. Others always could be seen coming, a strange\nprocession, some slouching along with the characteristic hopeless gait\nof professional strays, some coming with hesitating steps, wearing the\nair of men to whom this sort of thing was new.\n\nIt was an afternoon of incredible length. The snow, blowing in twisting\nclouds, sought out the men in their meagre hiding-places, and skilfully\nbeat in among them, drenching their persons with showers of fine\nstinging flakes. They crowded together, muttering, and fumbling in\ntheir pockets to get their red inflamed wrists covered by the cloth.\n\nNew-comers usually halted at one end of the groups and addressed a\nquestion, perhaps much as a matter of form, \"Is it open yet?\"\n\nThose who had been waiting inclined to take the questioner seriously\nand became contemptuous. \"No; do yeh think we'd be standin' here?\"\n\nThe gathering swelled in numbers steadily and persistently. One could\nalways see them coming, trudging slowly through the storm.\n\nFinally, the little snow plains in the street began to assume a leaden\nhue from the shadows of evening. The buildings upreared gloomily save\nwhere various windows became brilliant figures of light, that made\nshimmers and splashes of yellow on the snow. A street lamp on the curb\nstruggled to illuminate, but it was reduced to impotent blindness by\nthe swift gusts of sleet crusting its panes.\n\nIn this half-darkness, the men began to come from their shelter places\nand mass in front of the doors of charity. They were of all types, but\nthe nationalities were mostly American, German, and Irish. Many were\nstrong, healthy, clear-skinned fellows, with that stamp of countenance\nwhich is not frequently seen upon seekers after charity. There were\nmen of undoubted patience, industry, and temperance, who, in time of\nill-fortune, do not habitually turn to rail at the state of society,\nsnarling at the arrogance of the rich, and bemoaning the cowardice of\nthe poor, but who at these times are apt to wear a sudden and singular\nmeekness, as if they saw the world's progress marching from them, and\nwere trying to perceive where they had failed, what they had lacked, to\nbe thus vanquished in the race. Then there were others of the shifting,\nBowery element, who were used to paying ten cents for a place to sleep,\nbut who now came here because it was cheaper.\n\nBut they were all mixed in one mass so thoroughly that one could not\nhave discerned the different elements, but for the fact that the\nlabouring men, for the most part, remained silent and impassive in the\nblizzard, their eyes fixed on the windows of the house, statues of\npatience.\n\nThe sidewalk soon became completely blocked by the bodies of the men.\nThey pressed close to one another like sheep in a winter's gale,\nkeeping one another warm by the heat of their bodies. The snow came\ndown upon this compressed group of men until, directly from above, it\nmight have appeared like a heap of snow-covered merchandise, if it\nwere not for the fact that the crowd swayed gently with a unanimous,\nrhythmical motion. It was wonderful to see how the snow lay upon the\nheads and shoulders of these men, in little ridges an inch thick\nperhaps in places, the flakes steadily adding drop and drop, precisely\nas they fall upon the unresisting grass of the fields. The feet of the\nmen were all wet and cold, and the wish to warm them accounted for the\nslow, gentle, rhythmical motion. Occasionally some man whose ear or\nnose tingled acutely from the cold winds would wriggle down until his\nhead was protected by the shoulders of his companions.\n\nThere was a continuous murmuring discussion as to the probability of\nthe doors being speedily opened. They persistently lifted their eyes\ntowards the windows. One could hear little combats of opinion.\n\n\"There's a light in th' winder!\"\n\n\"Naw; it's a reflection f'm across th' way.\"\n\n\"Well, didn't I see 'em light it?\"\n\n\"You did?\"\n\n\"I did!\"\n\n\"Well, then, that settles it!\"\n\nAs the time approached when they expected to be allowed to enter, the\nmen crowded to the doors in an unspeakable crush, jamming and wedging\nin a way that it seemed would crack bones. They surged heavily against\nthe building in a powerful wave of pushing shoulders. Once a rumour\nflitted among all the tossing heads.\n\n\"They can't open th' door! Th' fellers er smack up agin 'em.\"\n\nThen a dull roar of rage came from the men on the outskirts; but all\nthe time they strained and pushed until it appeared to be impossible\nfor those that they cried out against to do anything but be crushed\ninto pulp.\n\n\"Ah, git away f'm th' door!\"\n\n\"Git outa that!\"\n\n\"Throw 'em out!\"\n\n\"Kill 'em!\"\n\n\"Say, fellers, now, what th' 'ell? G've 'em a chance t' open th' door!\"\n\n\"Yeh dam pigs, give 'em a chance t' open th' door!\"\n\nMen in the outskirts of the crowd occasionally yelled when a boot-heel\nof one of trampling feet crushed on their freezing extremities.\n\n\"Git off me feet, yeh clumsy tarrier!\"\n\n\"Say, don't stand on me feet! Walk on th' ground!\"\n\nA man near the doors suddenly shouted--\"O-o-oh! Le' me out--le' me\nout!\" And another, a man of infinite valour, once twisted his head\nso as to half face those who were pushing behind him. \"Quit yer\nshovin', yeh\"--and he delivered a volley of the most powerful and\nsingular invective, straight into the faces of the men behind him. It\nwas as if he was hammering the noses of them with curses of triple\nbrass. His face, red with rage, could be seen upon it, an expression\nof sublime disregard of consequences. But nobody cared to reply to\nhis imprecations; it was too cold. Many of them snickered, and all\ncontinued to push.\n\nIn occasional pauses of the crowd's movement the men had opportunities\nto make jokes; usually grim things, and no doubt very uncouth.\nNevertheless, they were notable--one does not expect to find the\nquality of humour in a heap of old clothes under a snow-drift.\n\nThe winds seemed to grow fiercer as time wore on. Some of the gusts of\nsnow that came down on the close collection of heads, cut like knives\nand needles, and the men huddled, and swore, not like dark assassins,\nbut in a sort of American fashion, grimly and desperately, it is true,\nbut yet with a wondrous under-effect, indefinable and mystic, as if\nthere was some kind of humour in this catastrophe, in this situation in\na night of snow-laden winds.\n\nOnce the window of the huge dry-goods shop across the street furnished\nmaterial for a few moments of forgetfulness. In the brilliantly-lighted\nspace appeared the figure of a man. He was rather stout and very well\nclothed. His beard was fashioned charmingly after that of the Prince\nof Wales. He stood in an attitude of magnificent reflection. He slowly\nstroked his moustache with a certain grandeur of manner, and looked\ndown at the snow-encrusted mob. From below, there was denoted a supreme\ncomplacence in him. It seemed that the sight operated inversely, and\nenabled him to more clearly regard his own delightful environment.\n\nOne of the mob chanced to turn his head, and perceived the figure in\nthe window. \"Hello, lookit 'is whiskers,\" he said genially.\n\nMany of the men turned then, and a shout went up. They called to him\nin all strange keys. They addressed him in every manner, from familiar\nand cordial greetings, to carefully-worded advice concerning changes in\nhis personal appearance. The man presently fled, and the mob chuckled\nferociously, like ogres who had just devoured something.\n\nThey turned then to serious business. Often they addressed the stolid\nfront of the house.\n\n\"Oh, let us in fer Gawd's sake!\"\n\n\"Let us in, or we'll all drop dead!\"\n\n\"Say, what's th' use o' keepin' us poor Indians out in th' cold?\"\n\nAnd always some one was saying, \"Keep off my feet.\"\n\nThe crushing of the crowd grew terrific toward the last. The men, in\nkeen pain from the blasts, began almost to fight. With the pitiless\nwhirl of snow upon them, the battle for shelter was going to the\nstrong. It became known that the basement door at the foot of a little\nsteep flight of stairs was the one to be opened, and they jostled and\nheaved in this direction like labouring fiends. One could hear them\npanting and groaning in their fierce exertion.\n\nUsually some one in the front ranks was protesting to those in the\nrear--\"O-o-ow! Oh, say now, fellers, let up, will yeh? Do yeh wanta\nkill somebody!\"\n\nA policeman arrived and went into the midst of them, scolding and\nbe-rating, occasionally threatening, but using no force but that of his\nhands and shoulders against these men who were only struggling to get\nin out of the storm. His decisive tones rang out sharply--\"Stop that\npushin' back there! Come, boys, don't push! Stop that! Here you, quit\nyer shovin'! Cheese that!\"\n\nWhen the door below was opened, a thick stream of men forced a way down\nthe stairs, which were of an extraordinary narrowness, and seemed only\nwide enough for one at a time. Yet they somehow went down almost three\nabreast. It was a difficult and painful operation. The crowd was like\na turbulent water forcing itself through one tiny outlet. The men in\nthe rear, excited by the success of the others, made frantic exertions,\nfor it seemed that this large band would more than fill the quarters,\nand that many would be left upon the pavements. It would be disastrous\nto be of the last, and accordingly men with the snow biting their\nfaces, writhed and twisted with their might. One expected that from the\ntremendous pressure, the narrow passage to the basement door would be\nso choked and clogged with human limbs and bodies that movement would\nbe impossible. Once indeed the crowd was forced to stop, and a cry\nwent along that a man had been injured at the foot of the stairs. But\npresently the slow movement began again, and the policeman fought at\nthe top of the flight to ease the pressure of those that were going\ndown.\n\nA reddish light from a window fell upon the faces of the men, when\nthey, in turn, arrived at the last three steps, and were about to\nenter. One could then note a change of expression that had come over\ntheir features. As they stood thus upon the threshold of their hopes,\nthey looked suddenly contented and complacent. The fire had passed from\ntheir eyes and the snarl had vanished from their lips. The very force\nof the crowd in the rear, which had previously vexed them, was regarded\nfrom another point of view, for it now made it inevitable that they\nshould go through the little doors into the place that was cheery and\nwarm with light.\n\nThe tossing crowd on the sidewalk grew smaller and smaller. The snow\nbeat with merciless persistence upon the bowed heads of those who\nwaited. The wind drove it up from the pavements in frantic forms of\nwinding white, and it seethed in circles about the huddled forms\npassing in one by one, three by three, out of the storm.\n\n\n\n\n          THE DUEL THAT WAS NOT FOUGHT\n\n\nPatsy Tulligan was not as wise as seven owls, but his courage could\nthrow a shadow as long as the steeple of a cathedral. There were men on\nCherry Street who had whipped him five times, but they all knew that\nPatsy would be as ready for the sixth time as if nothing had happened.\n\nOnce he and two friends had been away up on Eighth Avenue, far out\nof their country, and upon their return journey that evening they\nstopped frequently in saloons until they were as independent of their\nsurroundings as eagles, and cared much less about thirty days on\nBlackwell's.\n\nOn Lower Sixth Avenue they paused in a saloon where there was a good\ndeal of lamp-glare and polished wood to be seen from the outside,\nand within, the mellow light shone on much furbished brass and more\npolished wood. It was a better saloon than they were in the habit of\nseeing, but they did not mind it. They sat down at one of the little\ntables that were in a row parallel to the bar and ordered beer. They\nblinked stolidly at the decorations, the bar-tender, and the other\ncustomers. When anything transpired they discussed it with dazzling\nfrankness, and what they said of it was as free as air to the other\npeople in the place.\n\nAt midnight there were few people in the saloon. Patsy and his friends\nstill sat drinking. Two well-dressed men were at another table,\nsmoking cigars slowly and swinging back in their chairs. They occupied\nthemselves with themselves in the usual manner, never betraying by a\nwink of an eyelid that they knew that other folk existed. At another\ntable directly behind Patsy and his companions was a slim little Cuban,\nwith miraculously small feet and hands, and with a youthful touch of\ndown upon his lip. As he lifted his cigarette from time to time his\nlittle finger was bended in dainty fashion, and there was a green flash\nwhen a huge emerald ring caught the light. The bar-tender came often\nwith his little brass tray. Occasionally Patsy and his two friends\nquarrelled.\n\nOnce this little Cuban happened to make some slight noise and Patsy\nturned his head to observe him. Then Patsy made a careless and rather\nloud comment to his two friends. He used a word which is no more than\npassing the time of day down in Cherry Street, but to the Cuban it was\na dagger-point. There was a harsh scraping sound as a chair was pushed\nswiftly back.\n\nThe little Cuban was upon his feet. His eyes were shining with a rage\nthat flashed there like sparks as he glared at Patsy. His olive face\nhad turned a shade of grey from his anger. Withal his chest was thrust\nout in portentous dignity, and his hand, still grasping his wine-glass,\nwas cool and steady, the little finger still bended, the great emerald\ngleaming upon it. The others, motionless, stared at him.\n\n\"Sir,\" he began ceremoniously. He spoke gravely and in a slow way, his\ntone coming in a marvel of self-possessed cadences from between those\nlips which quivered with wrath. \"You have insult me. You are a dog, a\nhound, a cur. I spit upon you. I must have some of your blood.\"\n\nPatsy looked at him over his shoulder.\n\n\"What's th' matter wi' che?\" he demanded. He did not quite understand\nthe words of this little man who glared at him steadily, but he knew\nthat it was something about fighting. He snarled with the readiness of\nhis class and heaved his shoulders contemptuously. \"Ah, what's eatin'\nyeh? Take a walk! You h'ain't got nothin' t' do with me, have yeh?\nWell, den, go sit on yerself.\"\n\nAnd his companions leaned back valorously in their chairs, and\nscrutinized this slim young fellow who was addressing Patsy.\n\n\"What's de little Dago chewin' about?\"\n\n\"He wants t' scrap!\"\n\n\"What!\"\n\nThe Cuban listened with apparent composure. It was only when they\nlaughed that his body cringed as if he was receiving lashes. Presently\nhe put down his glass and walked over to their table. He proceeded\nalways with the most impressive deliberation.\n\n\"Sir,\" he began again. \"You have insult me. I must have\ns-s-satisfac-shone. I must have your body upon the point of my\nsword. In my country you would already be dead. I must have\ns-s-satisfac-shone.\"\n\nPatsy had looked at the Cuban with a trifle of bewilderment. But at\nlast his face began to grow dark with belligerency, his mouth curve in\nthat wide sneer with which he would confront an angel of darkness. He\narose suddenly in his seat and came towards the little Cuban. He was\ngoing to be impressive too.\n\n\"Say, young feller, if yeh go shootin' off fer face at me, I'll wipe\nd' joint wid yeh. What'cher gaffin' about, hey? Are yeh givin' me er\njolly? Say, if yeh pick me up fer a cinch, I'll fool yeh. Dat's what!\nDon't take me fer no dead easy mug.\" And as he glowered at the little\nCuban, he ended his oration with one eloquent word, \"Nit!\"\n\nThe bar-tender nervously polished his bar with a towel, and kept his\neyes fastened upon the men. Occasionally he became transfixed with\ninterest, leaning forward with one hand upon the edge of the bar and\nthe other holding the towel grabbed in a lump, as if he had been turned\ninto bronze when in the very act of polishing.\n\nThe Cuban did not move when Patsy came toward him and delivered his\noration. At its conclusion he turned his livid face toward where, above\nhim, Patsy was swaggering and heaving his shoulders in a consummate\ndisplay of bravery and readiness. The Cuban, in his clear, tense tones,\nspoke one word. It was the bitter insult. It seemed to fairly spin from\nhis lips and crackle in the air like breaking glass.\n\nEvery man save the little Cuban made an electric movement. Patsy\nroared a black oath and thrust himself forward until he towered almost\ndirectly above the other man. His fists were doubled into knots of bone\nand hard flesh. The Cuban had raised a steady finger.\n\n\"If you touch me wis your hand, I will keel you.\"\n\nThe two well-dressed men had come swiftly, uttering protesting cries.\nThey suddenly intervened in this second of time in which Patsy had\nsprung forward and the Cuban had uttered his threat. The four men were\nnow a tossing, arguing, violent group, one well-dressed man lecturing\nthe Cuban, and the other holding off Patsy, who was now wild with rage,\nloudly repeating the Cuban's threat, and manoeuvring and struggling\nto get at him for revenge's sake.\n\nThe bar-tender, feverishly scouring away with his towel, and at times\npacing to and fro with nervous and excited tread, shouted out--\n\n\"Say, for heaven's sake, don't fight in here. If yeh wanta fight, go\nout in the street and fight all yeh please. But don't fight in here.\"\n\nPatsy knew only one thing, and this he kept repeating--\n\n\"Well, he wants t' scrap! I didn't begin dis! He wants t' scrap.\"\n\nThe well-dressed man confronting him continually replied--\n\n\"Oh, well, now, look here, he's only a lad. He don't know what he's\ndoing. He's crazy mad. You wouldn't slug a kid like that.\"\n\nPatsy and his aroused companions, who cursed and growled, were\npersistent with their argument. \"Well, he wants t' scrap!\" The whole\naffair was as plain as daylight when one saw this great fact. The\ninterference and intolerable discussion brought the three of them\nforward, battleful and fierce.\n\n\"What's eatin' you, anyhow?\" they demanded. \"Dis ain't your business,\nis it? What business you got shootin' off your face?\"\n\nThe other peacemaker was trying to restrain the little Cuban, who had\ngrown shrill and violent.\n\n\"If he touch me wis his hand I will keel him. We must fight like\ngentlemen or else I keel him when he touch me wis his hand.\"\n\nThe man who was fending off Patsy comprehended these sentences that\nwere screamed behind his back, and he explained to Patsy--\n\n\"But he wants to fight you with swords. With swords, you know.\"\n\nThe Cuban, dodging around the peacemakers, yelled in Patsy's face--\n\n\"Ah, if I could get you before me wis my sword! Ah! Ah! A-a-ah!\" Patsy\nmade a furious blow with a swift fist, but the peacemakers bucked\nagainst his body suddenly like football players.\n\nPatsy was greatly puzzled. He continued doggedly to try to get near\nenough to the Cuban to punch him. To these attempts the Cuban replied\nsavagely--\n\n\"If you touch me wis your hand, I will cut your heart in two piece.\"\n\nAt last Patsy said--\"Well, if he's so dead stuck on fightin' wid\nswords, I'll fight 'im. Soitenly! I'll fight 'im.\" All this palaver had\nevidently tired him, and he now puffed out his lips with the air of a\nman who is willing to submit to any conditions if he can only bring on\nthe row soon enough. He swaggered, \"I'll fight 'im wid swords. Let 'im\nbring on his swords, an' I'll fight 'im 'til he's ready t' quit.\"\n\nThe two well-dressed men grinned. \"Why, look here,\" they said to Patsy,\n\"he'd punch you full of holes. Why, he's a fencer. You can't fight him\nwith swords. He'd kill you in 'bout a minute.\"\n\n\"Well, I'll giv' 'im a go at it, anyhow,\" said Patsy, stout-hearted and\nresolute. \"I'll giv' 'im a go at it, anyhow, an' I'll stay wid 'im long\nas I kin.\"\n\nAs for the Cuban, his lithe little body was quivering in an ecstasy of\nthe muscles. His face radiant with a savage joy, he fastened his glance\nupon Patsy, his eyes gleaming with a gloating, murderous light. A most\nunspeakable, animal-like rage was in his expression.\n\n\"Ah! ah! He will fight me! Ah!\" He bended unconsciously in the posture\nof a fencer. He had all the quick, springy movements of a skilful\nswordsman. \"Ah, the b-r-r-rute! The b-r-r-rute! I will stick him like a\npig!\"\n\nThe two peacemakers, still grinning broadly, were having a great time\nwith Patsy.\n\n\"Why, you infernal idiot, this man would slice you all up. You better\njump off the bridge if you want to commit suicide. You wouldn't stand a\nghost of a chance to live ten seconds.\"\n\nPatsy was as unshaken as granite. \"Well, if he wants t' fight wid\nswords, he'll get it. I'll giv' 'im a go at it, anyhow.\"\n\nOne man said--\"Well, have you got a sword? Do you know what a sword is?\nHave you got a sword?\"\n\n\"No, I ain't got none,\" said Patsy honestly, \"but I kin git one.\" Then\nhe added valiantly--\"An' quick too.\"\n\nThe two men laughed. \"Why, can't you understand it would be sure death\nto fight a sword duel with this fellow?\"\n\n\"Dat's all right! See? I know me own business. If he wants t' fight one\nof dees d--n duels, I'm in it, understan'?\"\n\n\"Have you ever fought one, you fool?\"\n\n\"No, I ain't. But I will fight one, dough! I ain't no muff. If he want\nt' fight a duel, by Gawd, I'm wid 'im! D'yeh understan' dat!\" Patsy\ncocked his hat and swaggered. He was getting very serious.\n\nThe little Cuban burst out--\"Ah, come on, sirs: come on! We can take\ncab. Ah, you big cow, I will stick you, I will stick you. Ah, you will\nlook very beautiful, very beautiful. Ah, come on, sirs. We will stop at\nhotel--my hotel. I there have weapons.\"\n\n\"Yeh will, will yeh? Yeh bloomin' little black Dago,\" cried Patsy in\nhoarse and maddened reply to the personal part of the Cuban's speech.\nHe stepped forward. \"Git yer d--n swords,\" he commanded. \"Git yer\nswords. Git 'em quick! I'll fight wi' che! I'll fight wid anyting, too!\nSee? I'll fight yeh wid a knife an' fork if yeh say so! I'll fight yer\nstandin' up er sittin' down!\" Patsy delivered this intense oration\nwith sweeping, intensely emphatic gestures, his hands stretched out\neloquently, his jaw thrust forward, his eyes glaring.\n\n\"Ah,\" cried the little Cuban joyously. \"Ah, you are in very pretty\ntemper. Ah, how I will cut your heart in two piece, my dear, d-e-a-r\nfriend.\" His eyes, too, shone like carbuncles, with a swift, changing\nglitter, always fastened upon Patsy's face.\n\nThe two peacemakers were perspiring and in despair. One of them blurted\nout--\n\n\"Well, I'll be blamed if this ain't the most ridiculous thing I ever\nsaw.\"\n\nThe other said--\"For ten dollars I'd be tempted to let these two\ninfernal blockheads have their duel.\"\n\nPatsy was strutting to and fro, and conferring grandly with his friends.\n\n\"He took me for a muff. He tought he was goin' t' bluff me out, talkin'\n'bout swords. He'll get fooled.\" He addressed the Cuban--\"You're a fine\nlittle dirty picter of a scrapper, ain't che? I'll chew yez up, dat's\nwhat I will.\"\n\nThere began then some rapid action. The patience of well-dressed men\nis not an eternal thing. It began to look as if it would at last be a\nfight with six corners to it. The faces of the men were shining red\nwith anger. They jostled each other defiantly, and almost every one\nblazed out at three or four of the others. The bar-tender had given up\nprotesting. He swore for a time, and banged his glasses. Then he jumped\nthe bar and ran out of the saloon, cursing sullenly.\n\nWhen he came back with a policeman, Patsy and the Cuban were preparing\nto depart together. Patsy was delivering his last oration--\n\n\"I'll fight yer wid swords! Sure I will! Come ahead, Dago! I'll fight\nyeh anywheres wid anyting! We'll have a large, juicy scrap, an' don't\nyeh forgit dat! I'm right wid yez. I ain't no muff! I scrap wid a man\njest as soon as he ses scrap, an' if yeh wanta scrap, I'm yer kitten.\nUnderstan' dat?\"\n\nThe policeman said sharply--\"Come, now; what's all this?\" He had a\ndistinctly business air.\n\nThe little Cuban stepped forward calmly. \"It is none of your business.\"\n\nThe policeman flushed to his ears. \"What?\"\n\nOne well-dressed man touched the other on the sleeve. \"Here's the time\nto skip,\" he whispered. They halted a block away from the saloon and\nwatched the policeman pull the Cuban through the door. There was a\nminute of scuffle on the sidewalk, and into this deserted street at\nmidnight fifty people appeared at once as if from the sky to watch it.\n\nAt last the three Cherry Hill men came from the saloon, and swaggered\nwith all their old valour toward the peacemakers.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Patsy to them, \"he was so hot talkin' about this duel\nbusiness, but I would a-given 'im a great scrap, an' don't yeh forgit\nit.\"\n\nFor Patsy was not as wise as seven owls, but his courage could throw a\nshadow as long as the steeple of a cathedral.\n\n\n\n\n            AN OMINOUS BABY\n\n\nA baby was wandering in a strange country. He was a tattered child with\na frowsled wealth of yellow hair. His dress, of a checked stuff, was\nsoiled, and showed the marks of many conflicts, like the chain-shirt\nof a warrior. His sun-tanned knees shone above wrinkled stockings,\nwhich he pulled up occasionally with an impatient movement when they\nentangled his feet. From a gaping shoe there appeared an array of tiny\ntoes.\n\nHe was toddling along an avenue between rows of stolid brown houses.\nHe went slowly, with a look of absorbed interest on his small flushed\nface. His blue eyes stared curiously. Carriages went with a musical\nrumble over the smooth asphalt. A man with a chrysanthemum was going\nup steps. Two nursery maids chatted as they walked slowly, while their\ncharges hobnobbed amiably between perambulators. A truck wagon roared\nthunderously in the distance.\n\nThe child from the poor district made his way along the brown street\nfilled with dull grey shadows. High up, near the roofs, glancing\nsun-rays changed cornices to blazing gold and silvered the fronts of\nwindows. The wandering baby stopped and stared at the two children\nlaughing and playing in their carriages among the heaps of rugs and\ncushions. He braced his legs apart in an attitude of earnest attention.\nHis lower jaw fell, and disclosed his small, even teeth. As they moved\non, he followed the carriages with awe in his face as if contemplating\na pageant. Once one of the babies, with twittering laughter, shook a\ngorgeous rattle at him. He smiled jovially in return.\n\nFinally a nursery maid ceased conversation and, turning, made a gesture\nof annoyance.\n\n\"Go 'way, little boy,\" she said to him. \"Go 'way. You're all dirty.\"\n\nHe gazed at her with infant tranquillity for a moment, and then went\nslowly off dragging behind him a bit of rope he had acquired in another\nstreet. He continued to investigate the new scenes. The people and\nhouses struck him with interest as would flowers and trees. Passengers\nhad to avoid the small, absorbed figure in the middle of the sidewalk.\nThey glanced at the intent baby face covered with scratches and dust as\nwith scars and with powder smoke.\n\nAfter a time, the wanderer discovered upon the pavement a pretty child\nin fine clothes playing with a toy. It was a tiny fire-engine, painted\nbrilliantly in crimson and gold. The wheels rattled as its small owner\ndragged it uproariously about by means of a string. The babe with his\nbit of rope trailing behind him paused and regarded the child and\nthe toy. For a long while he remained motionless, save for his eyes,\nwhich followed all movements of the glittering thing. The owner paid\nno attention to the spectator, but continued his joyous imitations of\nphases of the career of a fire-engine. His gleeful baby laugh rang\nagainst the calm fronts of the houses. After a little the wandering\nbaby began quietly to sidle nearer. His bit of rope, now forgotten,\ndropped at his feet. He removed his eyes from the toy and glanced\nexpectantly at the other child.\n\n\"Say,\" he breathed softly.\n\nThe owner of the toy was running down the walk at top speed. His tongue\nwas clanging like a bell and his legs were galloping. He did not look\naround at the coaxing call from the small tattered figure on the curb.\n\nThe wandering baby approached still nearer, and presently spoke again.\n\n\"Say,\" he murmured, \"le' me play wif it?\"\n\nThe other child interrupted some shrill tootings. He bended his head\nand spoke disdainfully over his shoulder.\n\n\"No,\" he said.\n\nThe wanderer retreated to the curb. He failed to notice the bit of\nrope, once treasured. His eyes followed as before the winding course of\nthe engine, and his tender mouth twitched.\n\n\"Say,\" he ventured at last, \"is dat yours?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said the other, tilting his round chin. He drew his property\nsuddenly behind him as if it were menaced. \"Yes,\" he repeated, \"it's\nmine.\"\n\n\"Well, le' me play wif it?\" said the wandering baby, with a trembling\nnote of desire in his voice.\n\n\"No,\" cried the pretty child with determined lips. \"It's mine. My ma-ma\nbuyed it.\"\n\n\"Well, tan't I play wif it?\" His voice was a sob. He stretched forth\nlittle covetous hands.\n\n\"No,\" the pretty child continued to repeat. \"No, it's mine.\"\n\n\"Well, I want to play wif it,\" wailed the other. A sudden fierce frown\nmantled his baby face. He clenched his fat hands and advanced with a\nformidable gesture. He looked some wee battler in a war.\n\n\"It's mine! It's mine,\" cried the pretty child, his voice in the treble\nof outraged rights.\n\n\"I want it,\" roared the wanderer.\n\n\"It's mine! It's mine!\"\n\n\"I want it!\"\n\n\"It's mine!\"\n\nThe pretty child retreated to the fence, and there paused at bay. He\nprotected his property with outstretched arms. The small vandal made a\ncharge. There was a short scuffle at the fence. Each grasped the string\nto the toy and tugged. Their faces were wrinkled with baby rage, the\nverge of tears. Finally, the child in tatters gave a supreme tug and\nwrenched the string from the other's hands. He set off rapidly down the\nstreet, bearing the toy in his arms. He was weeping with the air of\na wronged one who has at last succeeded in achieving his rights. The\nother baby was squalling lustily. He seemed quite helpless. He rung his\nchubby hands and railed.\n\nAfter the small barbarian had got some distance away, he paused and\nregarded his booty. His little form curved with pride. A soft, gleeful\nsmile loomed through the storm of tears. With great care he prepared\nthe toy for travelling. He stopped a moment on a corner and gazed at\nthe pretty child, whose small figure was quivering with sobs. As the\nlatter began to show signs of beginning pursuit, the little vandal\nturned and vanished down a dark side street as into a cavern.\n\n\n\n\n           A GREAT MISTAKE\n\n\nAn Italian kept a fruit-stand on a corner where he had good aim at the\npeople who came down from the elevated station, and at those who went\nalong two thronged streets. He sat most of the day in a backless chair\nthat was placed strategically.\n\nThere was a babe living hard by, up five flights of stairs, who\nregarded this Italian as a tremendous being. The babe had investigated\nthis fruit-stand. It had thrilled him as few things he had met with in\nhis travels had thrilled him. The sweets of the world had laid there\nin dazzling rows, tumbled in luxurious heaps. When he gazed at this\nItalian seated amid such splendid treasures, his lower lip hung low and\nhis eyes, raised to the vendor's face, were filled with deep respect,\nworship, as if he saw omnipotence.\n\nThe babe came often to this corner. He hovered about the stand\nand watched each detail of the business. He was fascinated by the\ntranquillity of the vendor, the majesty of power and possession. At\ntimes he was so engrossed in his contemplation that people, hurrying,\nhad to use care to avoid bumping him down.\n\nHe had never ventured very near to the stand. It was his habit to\nhang warily about the curb. Even there he resembled a babe who looks\nunbidden at a feast of gods.\n\nOne day, however, as the baby was thus staring, the vendor arose, and\ngoing along the front of the stand, began to polish oranges with a\nred pocket handkerchief. The breathless spectator moved across the\nside walk until his small face almost touched the vendor's sleeve. His\nfingers were gripped in a fold of his dress.\n\nAt last, the Italian finished with the oranges and returned to his\nchair. He drew a newspaper printed in his language from behind a bunch\nof bananas. He settled himself in a comfortable position, and began to\nglare savagely at the print. The babe was left face to face with the\nmassed joys of the world. For a time he was a simple worshipper at this\ngolden shrine. Then tumultuous desires began to shake him. His dreams\nwere of conquest. His lips moved. Presently into his head there came a\nlittle plan. He sidled nearer, throwing swift and cunning glances at\nthe Italian. He strove to maintain his conventional manner, but the\nwhole plot was written upon his countenance.\n\nAt last he had come near enough to touch the fruit. From the tattered\nskirt came slowly his small dirty hand. His eyes were still fixed upon\nthe vendor. His features were set, save for the under lip, which had a\nfaint fluttering movement. The hand went forward.\n\nElevated trains thundered to the station and the stairway poured people\nupon the sidewalks. There was a deep sea roar from feet and wheels\ngoing ceaselessly. None seemed to perceive the babe engaged in a great\nventure.\n\nThe Italian turned his paper. Sudden panic smote the babe. His hand\ndropped, and he gave vent to a cry of dismay. He remained for a moment\nstaring at the vendor. There was evidently a great debate in his\nmind. His infant intellect had defined this Italian. The latter was\nundoubtedly a man who would eat babes that provoked him. And the alarm\nin the babe when this monarch had turned his newspaper brought vividly\nbefore him the consequences if he were detected. But at this moment the\nvendor gave a blissful grunt, and tilting his chair against a wall,\nclosed his eyes. His paper dropped unheeded.\n\nThe babe ceased his scrutiny and again raised his hand. It was\nmoved with supreme caution toward the fruit. The fingers were bent,\nclaw-like, in the manner of great heart-shaking greed. Once he stopped\nand chattered convulsively, because the vendor moved in his sleep. The\nbabe, with his eyes still upon the Italian, again put forth his hand,\nand the rapacious fingers closed over a round bulb.\n\nAnd it was written that the Italian should at this moment open his\neyes. He glared at the babe a fierce question. Thereupon the babe\nthrust the round bulb behind him, and with a face expressive of the\ndeepest guilt, began a wild but elaborate series of gestures declaring\nhis innocence. The Italian howled. He sprang to his feet, and with\nthree steps overtook the babe. He whirled him fiercely, and took from\nthe little fingers a lemon.\n\n\n\n\n           AN ELOQUENCE OF GRIEF\n\n\nThe windows were high and saintly, of the shape that is found in\nchurches. From time to time a policeman at the door spoke sharply to\nsome incoming person. \"Take your hat off!\" He displayed in his voice\nthe horror of a priest when the sanctity of a chapel is defied or\nforgotten. The court-room was crowded with people who sloped back\ncomfortably in their chairs, regarding with undeviating glances the\nprocession and its attendant and guardian policemen that moved slowly\ninside the spear-topped railing. All persons connected with a case went\nclose to the magistrate's desk before a word was spoken in the matter,\nand then their voices were toned to the ordinary talking strength. The\ncrowd in the court-room could not hear a sentence; they could merely\nsee shifting figures, men that gestured quietly, women that sometimes\nraised an eager eloquent arm. They could not always see the judge,\nalthough they were able to estimate his location by the tall stands\nsurmounted by white globes that were at either hand of him. And so\nthose who had come for curiosity's sweet sake wore an air of being in\nwait for a cry of anguish, some loud painful protestation that would\nbring the proper thrill to their jaded, world-weary nerves--wires that\nrefused to vibrate for ordinary affairs.\n\nInside the railing the court officers shuffled the various groups with\nspeed and skill; and behind the desk the magistrate patiently toiled\nhis way through mazes of wonderful testimony.\n\nIn a corner of this space, devoted to those who had business before\nthe judge, an officer in plain clothes stood with a girl that wept\nconstantly. None seemed to notice the girl, and there was no reason why\nshe should be noticed, if the curious in the body of the court-room\nwere not interested in the devastation which tears bring upon some\ncomplexions. Her tears seemed to burn like acid, and they left fierce\npink marks on her face. Occasionally the girl looked across the room,\nwhere two well-dressed young women and a man stood waiting with the\nserenity of people who are not concerned as to the interior fittings of\na jail.\n\nThe business of the court progressed, and presently the girl, the\nofficer, and the well-dressed contingent stood before the judge.\nThereupon two lawyers engaged in some preliminary fire-wheels, which\nwere endured generally in silence. The girl, it appeared, was accused\nof stealing fifty dollars' worth of silk clothing from the room of one\nof the well-dressed women. She had been a servant in the house.\n\nIn a clear way, and with none of the ferocity that an accuser often\nexhibits in a police-court, calmly and moderately, the two young women\ngave their testimony. Behind them stood their escort, always mute.\nHis part, evidently, was to furnish the dignity, and he furnished it\nheavily, almost massively.\n\nWhen they had finished, the girl told her part. She had full, almost\nAfric, lips, and they had turned quite white. The lawyer for the others\nasked some questions, which he did--be it said, in passing--with the\nair of a man throwing flower-pots at a stone house.\n\nIt was a short case and soon finished. At the end of it the judge said\nthat, considering the evidence, he would have to commit the girl for\ntrial. Instantly the quick-eyed court officer began to clear the way\nfor the next case. The well-dressed women and their escort turned one\nway and the girl turned another, toward a door with an austere arch\nleading into a stone-paved passage. Then it was that a great cry rang\nthrough the court-room, the cry of this girl who believed that she was\nlost.\n\nThe loungers, many of them, underwent a spasmodic movement as if they\nhad been knived. The court officers rallied quickly. The girl fell back\nopportunely for the arms of one of them, and her wild heels clicked\ntwice on the floor. \"I am innocent! Oh, I am innocent!\"\n\nPeople pity those who need none, and the guilty sob alone; but innocent\nor guilty, this girl's scream described such a profound depth of\nwoe--it was so graphic of grief, that it slit with a dagger's sweep the\ncurtain of common-place, and disclosed the gloom-shrouded spectre that\nsat in the young girl's heart so plainly, in so universal a tone of the\nmind, that a man heard expressed some far-off midnight terror of his\nown thought.\n\nThe cries died away down the stone-paved passage. A patrol-man leaned\none arm composedly on the railing, and down below him stood an aged,\nalmost toothless wanderer, tottering and grinning.\n\n\"Plase, yer honer,\" said the old man as the time arrived for him to\nspeak, \"if ye'll lave me go this time, I've niver been dhrunk befoor,\nsir.\"\n\nA court officer lifted his hand to hide a smile.\n\n\n\n\n             THE AUCTION\n\n\nSome said that Ferguson gave up sailoring because he was tired of the\nsea. Some said that it was because he loved a woman. In truth it was\nbecause he was tired of the sea and because he loved a woman.\n\nHe saw the woman once, and immediately she became for him the symbol\nof all things unconnected with the sea. He did not trouble to look\nagain at the grey old goddess, the muttering slave of the moon. Her\nsplendours, her treacheries, her smiles, her rages, her vanities, were\nno longer on his mind. He took heels after a little human being, and\nthe woman made his thought spin at all times like a top; whereas the\nocean had only made him think when he was on watch.\n\nHe developed a grin for the power of the sea, and, in derision, he\nwanted to sell the red and green parrot which had sailed four voyages\nwith him. The woman, however, had a sentiment concerning the bird's\nplumage, and she commanded Ferguson to keep it in order, as it\nhappened, that she might forget to put food in its cage.\n\nThe parrot did not attend the wedding. It stayed at home and\nblasphemed at a stock of furniture, bought on the installment plan, and\narrayed for the reception of the bride and groom.\n\nAs a sailor, Ferguson had suffered the acute hankering for port; and\nbeing now always in port, he tried to force life to become an endless\npicnic. He was not an example of diligent and peaceful citizenship.\nAblution became difficult in the little apartment, because Ferguson\nkept the wash-basin filled with ice and bottles of beer: and so,\nfinally, the dealer in second-hand furniture agreed to auction the\nhousehold goods on commission. Owing to an exceedingly liberal\ndefinition of a term, the parrot and cage were included. \"On the\nlevel?\" cried the parrot, \"On the level? On the level? On the level?\"\n\nOn the way to the sale, Ferguson's wife spoke hopefully. \"You can't\ntell, Jim,\" she said. \"Perhaps some of 'em will get to biddin', and we\nmight get almost as much as we paid for the things.\"\n\nThe auction room was in a cellar. It was crowded with people and with\nhouse furniture; so that as the auctioneer's assistant moved from one\npiece to another he caused a great shuffling. There was an astounding\nnumber of old women in curious bonnets. The rickety stairway was\nthronged with men who wished to smoke and be free from the old women.\nTwo lamps made all the faces appear yellow as parchment. Incidentally\nthey could impart a lustre of value to very poor furniture.\n\nThe auctioneer was a fat, shrewd-looking individual, who seemed also to\nbe a great bully. The assistant was the most imperturbable of beings,\nmoving with the dignity of an image on rollers. As the Fergusons\nforced their way down the stair-way, the assistant roared: \"Number\ntwenty-one!\"\n\n\"Number twenty-one!\" cried the auctioneer. \"Number twenty-one! A fine\nnew handsome bureau! Two dollars? Two dollars is bid! Two and a half!\nTwo and a half! Three? Three is bid. Four! Four dollars! A fine new\nhandsome bureau at four dollars! Four dollars! Four dollars! F-o-u-r\nd-o-l-l-a-r-s! Sold at four dollars.\"\n\n\"On the level?\" cried the parrot, muffled somewhere among furniture and\ncarpets. \"On the level? On the level?\" Every one tittered.\n\nMrs. Ferguson had turned pale, and gripped her husband's arm. \"Jim! Did\nyou hear? The bureau--four dollars--\"\n\nFerguson glowered at her with the swift brutality of a man afraid of a\nscene. \"Shut up, can't you!\"\n\nMrs. Ferguson took a seat upon the steps; and hidden there by the thick\nranks of men, she began to softly sob. Through her tears appeared\nthe yellowish mist of the lamplight, streaming about the monstrous\nshadows of the spectators. From time to time these latter whispered\neagerly: \"See, that went cheap!\" In fact when anything was bought at a\nparticularly low price, a murmur of admiration arose for the successful\nbidder.\n\nThe bedstead was sold for two dollars, the mattresses and springs\nfor one dollar and sixty cents. This figure seemed to go through the\nwoman's heart. There was derision in the sound of it. She bowed her\nhead in her hands. \"Oh, God, a dollar-sixty! Oh, God, a dollar-sixty!\"\n\nThe parrot was evidently under heaps of carpet, but the dauntless bird\nstill raised the cry, \"On the level?\"\n\nSome of the men near Mrs. Ferguson moved timidly away upon hearing her\nlow sobs. They perfectly understood that a woman in tears is formidable.\n\nThe shrill voice went like a hammer, beat and beat, upon the woman's\nheart. An odour of varnish, of the dust of old carpets, assailed her\nand seemed to possess a sinister meaning. The golden haze from the two\nlamps was an atmosphere of shame, sorrow, greed. But it was when the\nparrot called that a terror of the place and of the eyes of the people\narose in her so strongly that she could not have lifted her head any\nmore than if her neck had been of iron.\n\nAt last came the parrot's turn. The assistant fumbled until he found\nthe ring of the cage, and the bird was drawn into view. It adjusted its\nfeathers calmly and cast a rolling wicked eye over the crowd.\n\n    \"Oh, the good ship Sarah sailed the seas,\n    And the wind it blew all day--\"\n\nThis was the part of a ballad which Ferguson had tried to teach it.\nWith a singular audacity and scorn, the parrot bawled these lines at\nthe auctioneer as if it considered them to bear some particular insult.\n\nThe throng in the cellar burst into laughter. The auctioneer attempted\nto start the bidding, and the parrot interrupted with a repetition\nof the lines. It swaggered to and fro on its perch, and gazed at the\nfaces of the crowd, with so much rowdy understanding and derision that\neven the auctioneer could not confront it. The auction was brought to a\nhalt; a wild hilarity developed, and every one gave jeering advice.\n\nFerguson looked down at his wife and groaned. She had cowered against\nthe wall, hiding her face. He touched her shoulder and she arose. They\nsneaked softly up the stairs with heads bowed.\n\nOut in the street, Ferguson gripped his fists and said: \"Oh, but\nwouldn't I like to strangle it!\"\n\nHis wife cried in a voice of wild grief: \"It--it m--made us a\nlaughing-stock in--in front of all that crowd!\"\n\nFor the auctioning of their household goods, the sale of their\nhome--this financial calamity lost its power in the presence of the\nsocial shame contained in a crowd's laughter.\n\n\n\n\n           THE PACE OF YOUTH\n\n\n                   I\n\nStimson stood in a corner and glowered. He was a fierce man and had\nindomitable whiskers, albeit he was very small.\n\n\"That young tarrier,\" he whispered to himself. \"He wants to quit makin'\neyes at Lizzie. This is too much of a good thing. First thing you know,\nhe'll get fired.\"\n\nHis brow creased in a frown, he strode over to the huge open doors and\nlooked at a sign. \"Stimson's Mammoth Merry-Go-Round,\" it read, and the\nglory of it was great. Stimson stood and contemplated the sign. It was\nan enormous affair; the letters were as large as men. The glow of it,\nthe grandeur of it was very apparent to Stimson. At the end of his\ncontemplation, he shook his head thoughtfully, determinedly. \"No, no,\"\nhe muttered. \"This is too much of a good thing. First thing you know,\nhe'll get fired.\"\n\nA soft booming sound of surf, mingled with the cries of bathers, came\nfrom the beach. There was a vista of sand and sky and sea that drew to\na mystic point far away in the northward. In the mighty angle, a girl\nin a red dress was crawling slowly like some kind of a spider on the\nfabric of nature. A few flags hung lazily above where the bath-houses\nwere marshalled in compact squares. Upon the edge of the sea stood\na ship with its shadowy sails painted dimly upon the sky, and high\noverhead in the still, sun-shot air a great hawk swung and drifted\nslowly.\n\nWithin the Merry-Go-Round there was a whirling circle of ornamental\nlions, giraffes, camels, ponies, goats, glittering with varnish and\nmetal that caught swift reflections from windows high above them. With\nstiff wooden legs, they swept on in a never-ending race, while a great\norchestrion clamoured in wild speed. The summer sunlight sprinkled its\ngold upon the garnet canopies carried by the tireless racers and upon\nall the devices of decoration that made Stimson's machine magnificent\nand famous. A host of laughing children bestrode the animals, bending\nforward like charging cavalrymen, and shaking reins and whooping in\nglee. At intervals they leaned out perilously to clutch at iron rings\nthat were tendered to them by a long wooden arm. At the intense moment\nbefore the swift grab for the rings one could see their little nervous\nbodies quiver with eagerness; the laughter rang shrill and excited.\nDown in the long rows of benches, crowds of people sat watching\nthe game, while occasionally a father might arise and go near to\nshout encouragement, cautionary commands, or applause at his flying\noffspring. Frequently mothers called out: \"Be careful, Georgie!\" The\norchestrion bellowed and thundered on its platform, filling the ears\nwith its long monotonous song. Over in a corner, a man in a white apron\nand behind a counter roared above the tumult: \"Pop corn! Pop corn!\"\n\nA young man stood upon a small, raised platform, erected in a manner\nof a pulpit, and just without the line of the circling figures. It was\nhis duty to manipulate the wooden arm and affix the rings. When all\nwere gone into the hands of the triumphant children, he held forth a\nbasket, into which they returned all save the coveted brass one, which\nmeant another ride free and made the holder very illustrious. The young\nman stood all day upon his narrow platform, affixing rings or holding\nforth the basket. He was a sort of general squire in these lists of\nchildhood. He was very busy.\n\nAnd yet Stimson, the astute, had noticed that the young man frequently\nfound time to twist about on his platform and smile at a girl who shyly\nsold tickets behind a silvered netting. This, indeed, was the great\nreason of Stimson's glowering. The young man upon the raised platform\nhad no manner of licence to smile at the girl behind the silvered\nnetting. It was a most gigantic insolence. Stimson was amazed at it.\n\"By Jiminy,\" he said to himself again, \"that fellow is smiling at my\ndaughter.\" Even in this tone of great wrath it could be discerned that\nStimson was filled with wonder that any youth should dare smile at the\ndaughter in the presence of the august father.\n\nOften the dark-eyed girl peered between the shining wires, and, upon\nbeing detected by the young man, she usually turned her head away\nquickly to prove to him that she was not interested. At other times,\nhowever, her eyes seemed filled with a tender fear lest he should\nfall from that exceedingly dangerous platform. As for the young man,\nit was plain that these glances filled him with valour, and he stood\ncarelessly upon his perch, as if he deemed it of no consequence that\nhe might fall from it. In all the complexities of his daily life and\nduties he found opportunity to gaze ardently at the vision behind the\nnetting.\n\nThis silent courtship was conducted over the heads of the crowd who\nthronged about the bright machine. The swift eloquent glances of the\nyoung man went noiselessly and unseen with their message. There had\nfinally become established between the two in this manner a subtle\nunderstanding and companionship. They communicated accurately all\nthat they felt. The boy told his love, his reverence, his hope in the\nchanges of the future. The girl told him that she loved him, that she\ndid not love him, that she did not know if she loved him, that she\nloved him. Sometimes a little sign saying \"cashier\" in gold letters,\nand hanging upon the silvered netting, got directly in range and\ninterfered with the tender message.\n\nThe love affair had not continued without anger, unhappiness, despair.\nThe girl had once smiled brightly upon a youth who came to buy some\ntickets for his little sister, and the young man upon the platform\nobserving this smile had been filled with gloomy rage. He stood like\na dark statue of vengeance upon his pedestal and thrust out the basket\nto the children with a gesture that was full of scorn for their hollow\nhappiness, for their insecure and temporary joy. For five hours he did\nnot once look at the girl when she was looking at him. He was going\nto crush her with his indifference; he was going to demonstrate that\nhe had never been serious. However, when he narrowly observed her in\nsecret he discovered that she seemed more blythe than was usual with\nher. When he found that his apparent indifference had not crushed\nher he suffered greatly. She did not love him, he concluded. If she\nhad loved him she would have been crushed. For two days he lived\na miserable existence upon his high perch. He consoled himself by\nthinking of how unhappy he was, and by swift, furtive glances at the\nloved face. At any rate he was in her presence, and he could get a good\nview from his perch when there was no interference by the little sign:\n\"Cashier.\"\n\nBut suddenly, swiftly, these clouds vanished, and under the imperial\nblue sky of the restored confidence they dwelt in peace, a peace\nthat was satisfaction, a peace that, like a babe, put its trust in\nthe treachery of the future. This confidence endured until the next\nday, when she, for an unknown cause, suddenly refused to look at\nhim. Mechanically he continued his task, his brain dazed, a tortured\nvictim of doubt, fear, suspicion. With his eyes he supplicated her to\ntelegraph an explanation. She replied with a stony glance that froze\nhis blood. There was a great difference in their respective reasons\nfor becoming angry. His were always foolish, but apparent, plain as\nthe moon. Hers were subtle, feminine, as incomprehensible as the stars,\nas mysterious as the shadows at night.\n\nThey fell and soared, and soared and fell in this manner until they\nknew that to live without each other would be a wandering in deserts.\nThey had grown so intent upon the uncertainties, the variations,\nthe guessings of their affair that the world had become but a huge\nimmaterial background. In time of peace their smiles were soft and\nprayerful, caresses confided to the air. In time of war, their youthful\nhearts, capable of profound agony, were wrung by the intricate emotions\nof doubt. They were the victims of the dread angel of affectionate\nspeculation that forces the brain endlessly on roads that lead nowhere.\n\nAt night, the problem of whether she loved him confronted the young man\nlike a spectre, looming as high as a hill and telling him not to delude\nhimself. Upon the following day, this battle of the night displayed\nitself in the renewed fervour of his glances and in their increased\nnumber. Whenever he thought he could detect that she too was suffering,\nhe felt a thrill of joy.\n\nBut there came a time when the young man looked back upon these\ncontortions with contempt. He believed then that he had imagined his\npain. This came about when the redoubtable Stimson marched forward to\nparticipate.\n\n\"This has got to stop,\" Stimson had said to himself, as he stood and\nwatched them. They had grown careless of the light world that clattered\nabout them; they were become so engrossed in their personal drama\nthat the language of their eyes was almost as obvious as gestures. And\nStimson, through his keenness, his wonderful, infallible penetration,\nsuddenly came into possession of these obvious facts. \"Well, of all the\nnerves,\" he said, regarding with a new interest the young man upon the\nperch.\n\nHe was a resolute man. He never hesitated to grapple with a crisis. He\ndecided to overturn everything at once, for, although small, he was\nvery fierce and impetuous. He resolved to crush this dreaming.\n\nHe strode over to the silvered netting. \"Say, you want to quit your\neverlasting grinning at that idiot,\" he said, grimly.\n\nThe girl cast down her eyes and made a little heap of quarters into a\nstack. She was unable to withstand the terrible scrutiny of her small\nand fierce father.\n\nStimson turned from his daughter and went to a spot beneath the\nplatform. He fixed his eyes upon the young man and said--\n\n\"I've been speakin' to Lizzie. You better attend strictly to your own\nbusiness or there'll be a new man here next week.\" It was as if he had\nblazed away with a shot-gun. The young man reeled upon his perch. At\nlast he in a measure regained his composure and managed to stammer:\n\"A--all right, sir.\" He knew that denials would be futile with the\nterrible Stimson. He agitatedly began to rattle the rings in the\nbasket, and pretend that he was obliged to count them or inspect them\nin some way. He, too, was unable to face the great Stimson.\n\nFor a moment, Stimson stood in fine satisfaction and gloated over the\neffect of his threat.\n\n\"I've fixed them,\" he said complacently, and went out to smoke a cigar\nand revel in himself. Through his mind went the proud reflection that\npeople who came in contact with his granite will usually ended in quick\nand abject submission.\n\n\n                   II\n\nOne evening, a week after Stimson had indulged in the proud reflection\nthat people who came in contact with his granite will usually ended\nin quick and abject submission, a young feminine friend of the girl\nbehind the silvered netting came to her there and asked her to walk on\nthe beach after \"Stimson's Mammoth Merry-Go-Round\" was closed for the\nnight. The girl assented with a nod.\n\nThe young man upon the perch holding the rings saw this nod and judged\nits meaning. Into his mind came an idea of defeating the watchfulness\nof the redoubtable Stimson.\n\nWhen the Merry-Go-Round was closed and the two girls started for the\nbeach, he wandered off aimlessly in another direction, but he kept\nthem in view, and as soon as he was assured that he had escaped the\nvigilance of Stimson, he followed them.\n\nThe electric lights on the beach made a broad band of tremoring\nlight, extending parallel to the sea, and upon the wide walk there\nslowly paraded a great crowd, intermingling, intertwining, sometimes\ncolliding. In the darkness stretched the vast purple expanse of the\nocean, and the deep indigo sky above was peopled with yellow stars.\nOccasionally out upon the water a whirling mass of froth suddenly\nflashed into view, like a great ghostly robe appearing, and then\nvanished, leaving the sea in its darkness, from whence came those bass\ntones of the water's unknown emotion. A wind, cool, reminiscent of the\nwave wastes, made the women hold their wraps about their throats, and\ncaused the men to grip the rims of their straw hats. It carried the\nnoise of the band in the pavilion in gusts. Sometimes people unable\nto hear the music, glanced up at the pavilion and were reassured upon\nbeholding the distant leader still gesticulating and bobbing, and the\nother members of the band with their lips glued to their instruments.\nHigh in the sky soared an unassuming moon, faintly silver.\n\nFor a time the young man was afraid to approach the two girls; he\nfollowed them at a distance and called himself a coward. At last,\nhowever, he saw them stop on the outer edge of the crowd and stand\nsilently listening to the voices of the sea. When he came to where they\nstood, he was trembling in his agitation. They had not seen him.\n\n\"Lizzie,\" he began. \"I----\"\n\nThe girl wheeled instantly and put her hand to her throat.\n\n\"Oh, Frank, how you frightened me,\" she said--inevitably.\n\n\"Well, you know I--I----\" he stuttered.\n\nBut the other girl was one of those beings who are born to attend\nat tragedies. She had for love a reverence, an admiration that was\ngreater the more that she contemplated the fact that she knew nothing\nof it. This couple, with their emotions, awed her and made her humbly\nwish that she might be destined to be of some service to them. She was\nvery homely.\n\nWhen the young man faltered before them, she, in her sympathy, actually\nover-estimated the crisis, and felt that he might fall dying at their\nfeet. Shyly, but with courage, she marched to the rescue.\n\n\"Won't you come and walk on the beach with us?\" she said.\n\nThe young woman gave her a glance of deep gratitude which was not\nwithout the patronage which a man in his condition naturally feels for\none who pities it. The three walked on.\n\nFinally, the being who was born to attend at this tragedy, said that\nshe wished to sit down and gaze at the sea, alone.\n\nThey politely urged her to walk on with them, but she was obstinate.\nShe wished to gaze at the sea, alone. The young man swore to himself\nthat he would be her friend until he died.\n\nAnd so the two young lovers went on without her. They turned once to\nlook at her.\n\n\"Jennie's awful nice,\" said the girl.\n\n\"You bet she is,\" replied the young man, ardently.\n\nThey were silent for a little time.\n\nAt last the girl said--\n\n\"You were angry at me yesterday.\"\n\n\"No, I wasn't.\"\n\n\"Yes, you were, too. You wouldn't look at me once all day.\"\n\n\"No, I wasn't angry. I was only putting on.\"\n\nThough she had, of course, known it, this confession seemed to make her\nvery indignant. She flashed a resentful glance at him.\n\n\"Oh, were you, indeed?\" she said with a great air.\n\nFor a few minutes she was so haughty with him that he loved her to\nmadness. And directly this poem, which stuck at his lips, came forth\nlamely in fragments.\n\nWhen they walked back toward the other girl and saw the patience of\nher attitude, their hearts swelled in a patronizing and secondary\ntenderness for her.\n\nThey were very happy. If they had been miserable they would have\ncharged this fairy scene of the night with a criminal heartlessness;\nbut as they were joyous, they vaguely wondered how the purple sea, the\nyellow stars, the changing crowds under the electric lights could be so\nphlegmatic and stolid.\n\nThey walked home by the lake-side way, and out upon the water those gay\npaper lanterns, flashing, fleeting, and careering, sang to them, sang a\nchorus of red and violet, and green and gold; a song of mystic bands of\nthe future.\n\nOne day, when business paused during a dull sultry afternoon, Stimson\nwent up town. Upon his return, he found that the popcorn man, from his\nstand over in a corner, was keeping an eye upon the cashier's cage, and\nthat nobody at all was attending to the wooden arm and the iron rings.\nHe strode forward like a sergeant of grenadiers.\n\n\"Where in thunder is Lizzie?\" he demanded, a cloud of rage in his eyes.\n\nThe popcorn man, although associated long with Stimson, had never got\nover being dazed.\n\n\"They've--they've--gone round to th'--th'--house,\" he said with\ndifficulty, as if he had just been stunned.\n\n\"Whose house?\" snapped Stimson.\n\n\"Your--your house, I 'spose,\" said the popcorn man.\n\nStimson marched round to his home. Kingly denunciations surged, already\nformulated, to the tip of his tongue, and he bided the moment when his\nanger could fall upon the heads of that pair of children. He found his\nwife convulsive and in tears.\n\n\"Where's Lizzie?\"\n\nAnd then she burst forth--\"Oh--John--John-they've run away, I know they\nhave. They drove by here not three minutes ago. They must have done\nit on purpose to bid me good-bye, for Lizzie waved her hand sad-like;\nand then, before I could get out to ask where they were going or what,\nFrank whipped up the horse.\"\n\nStimson gave vent to a dreadful roar.\n\n\"Get my revolver--get a hack--get my revolver, do you hear--what the\ndevil----\" His voice became incoherent.\n\nHe had always ordered his wife about as if she were a battalion of\ninfantry, and despite her misery, the training of years forced her to\nspring mechanically to obey; but suddenly she turned to him with a\nshrill appeal.\n\n\"Oh, John--not--the--revolver.\"\n\n\"Confound it, let go of me,\" he roared again, and shook her from him.\n\nHe ran hatless upon the street. There were a multitude of hacks at the\nsummer resort, but it was ages to him before he could find one. Then he\ncharged it like a bull.\n\n\"Uptown,\" he yelled, as he tumbled into the rear seat.\n\nThe hackman thought of severed arteries. His galloping horse distanced\na large number of citizens who had been running to find what caused\nsuch contortions by the little hatless man.\n\nIt chanced as the bouncing hack went along near the lake, Stimson gazed\nacross the calm grey expanse and recognized a colour in a bonnet and\na pose of a head. A buggy was travelling along a highway that led to\nSorington. Stimson bellowed--\"There--there--there they are--in that\nbuggy.\"\n\nThe hackman became inspired with the full knowledge of the situation.\nHe struck a delirious blow with the whip. His mouth expanded in a grin\nof excitement and joy. It came to pass that this old vehicle, with its\ndrowsy horse and its dusty-eyed and tranquil driver, seemed suddenly to\nawaken, to become animated and fleet. The horse ceased to ruminate on\nhis state, his air of reflection vanished. He became intent upon his\naged legs and spread them in quaint and ridiculous devices for speed.\nThe driver, his eyes shining, sat critically in his seat. He watched\neach motion of this rattling machine down before him. He resembled\nan engineer. He used the whip with judgment and deliberation as the\nengineer would have used coal or oil. The horse clacked swiftly upon\nthe macadam, the wheels hummed, the body of the vehicle wheezed and\ngroaned.\n\nStimson, in the rear seat, was erect in that impassive attitude that\ncomes sometimes to the furious man when he is obliged to leave the\nbattle to others. Frequently, however, the tempest in his breast came\nto his face and he howled--\n\n\"Go it--go it--you're gaining; pound 'im! Thump the life out of 'im;\nhit 'im hard, you fool.\" His hand grasped the rod that supported the\ncarriage top, and it was clenched so that the nails were faintly blue.\n\nAhead, that other carriage had been flying with speed, as from\nrealization of the menace in the rear. It bowled away rapidly, drawn\nby the eager spirit of a young and modern horse. Stimson could see\nthe buggy-top bobbing, bobbing. That little pane, like an eye, was a\nderision to him. Once he leaned forward and bawled angry sentences. He\nbegan to feel impotent; his whole expedition was a tottering of an old\nman upon a trail of birds. A sense of age made him choke again with\nwrath. That other vehicle, that was youth, with youth's pace; it was\nswift-flying with the hope of dreams. He began to comprehend those two\nchildren ahead of him, and he knew a sudden and strange awe, because he\nunderstood the power of their young blood, the power to fly strongly\ninto the future and feel and hope again, even at that time when his\nbones must be laid in the earth. The dust rose easily from the hot road\nand stifled the nostrils of Stimson.\n\nThe highway vanished far away in a point with a suggestion of\nintolerable length. The other vehicle was becoming so small that\nStimson could no longer see the derisive eye.\n\nAt last the hackman drew rein to his horse and turned to look at\nStimson.\n\n\"No use, I guess,\" he said.\n\nStimson made a gesture of acquiescence, rage, despair. As the\nhackman turned his dripping horse about, Stimson sank back with the\nastonishment and grief of a man who has been defied by the universe. He\nhad been in a great perspiration, and now his bald head felt cool and\nuncomfortable. He put up his hand with a sudden recollection that he\nhad forgotten his hat.\n\nAt last he made a gesture. It meant that at any rate he was not\nresponsible.\n\n\n\n\n              A DETAIL\n\n\nThe tiny old lady in the black dress and curious little black bonnet\nhad at first seemed alarmed at the sound made by her feet upon the\nstone pavements. But later she forgot about it, for she suddenly came\ninto the tempest of the Sixth Avenue shopping district, where from the\nstreams of people and vehicles went up a roar like that from headlong\nmountain torrents.\n\nShe seemed then like a chip that catches, recoils, turns and wheels, a\nreluctant thing in the clutch of the impetuous river. She hesitated,\nfaltered, debated with herself. Frequently she seemed about to address\npeople; then of a sudden she would evidently lose her courage.\nMeanwhile the torrent jostled her, swung her this and that way.\n\nAt last, however, she saw two young women gazing in at a shop-window.\nThey were well-dressed girls; they wore gowns with enormous sleeves\nthat made them look like full-rigged ships with all sails set. They\nseemed to have plenty of time; they leisurely scanned the goods in the\nwindow. Other people had made the tiny old woman much afraid because\nobviously they were speeding to keep such tremendously important\nengagements. She went close to the girls and peered in at the same\nwindow. She watched them furtively for a time. Then finally she said--\n\n\"Excuse me!\"\n\nThe girls looked down at this old face with its two large eyes turned\ntowards them.\n\n\"Excuse me, can you tell me where I can get any work?\"\n\nFor an instant the two girls stared. Then they seemed about to exchange\na smile, but, at the last moment, they checked it. The tiny old lady's\neyes were upon them. She was quaintly serious, silently expectant.\nShe made one marvel that in that face the wrinkles showed no trace of\nexperience, knowledge; they were simply little, soft, innocent creases.\nAs for her glance, it had the trustfulness of ignorance and the candour\nof babyhood.\n\n\"I want to get something to do, because I need the money,\" she\ncontinued since, in their astonishment, they had not replied to her\nfirst question. \"Of course I'm not strong and I couldn't do very much,\nbut I can sew well; and in a house where there was a good many men\nfolks, I could do all the mending. Do you know any place where they\nwould like me to come?\"\n\nThe young women did then exchange a smile, but it was a subtle tender\nsmile, the edge of personal grief.\n\n\"Well, no, madame,\" hesitatingly said one of them at last; \"I don't\nthink I know any one.\"\n\nA shade passed over the tiny old lady's face, a shadow of the wing of\ndisappointment.\n\n\"Don't you?\" she said, with a little struggle to be brave, in her voice.\n\nThen the girl hastily continued--\"But if you will give me your address,\nI may find some one, and if I do, I will surely let you know of it.\"\n\nThe tiny old lady dictated her address, bending over to watch the girl\nwrite on a visiting card with a little silver pencil. Then she said--\n\n\"I thank you very much.\" She bowed to them, smiling, and went on down\nthe avenue.\n\nAs for the two girls, they walked to the curb and watched this aged\nfigure, small and frail, in its black gown and curious black bonnet.\nAt last, the crowd, the innumerable wagons, intermingling and changing\nwith uproar and riot, suddenly engulfed it.\n\n\n\n\n    *************************************\n\n\n        Richard Clay & Sons, Limited,\n              London & Bungay.\n\n\n    *************************************\n\n\n\n\n           STEPHEN CRANE'S WORKS\n\n                 ---------\n\n          THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE\n\n    _Post 8vo, cloth, 3s. net; ornamental\n          wrapper, 2s. 6d. net._\n                                  [PIONEER SERIES.\n\n_The Saturday Review_--\"Mr. Stephen Crane's picture of the effect of\nactual fighting on a raw regiment is simply unapproached in intimate\nknowledge and sustained imaginative strength.

In his present book Mr. Crane is more\nthe rival of Mr. Henry James than of Mr. Rudyard Kipling. But he is\nintensely American, which can hardly be said of Mr. Henry James, and\nit is possible that if he continues in his present line of writing he\nmay be the author who will introduce the United States to the ordinary\nEnglish world.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at 809\nNorth 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1005,"split":"train"}
