{"ori_id":"1e44e31fb8bb26dc8aae3ca3cd7131acb59a447f","title":"The Cloister and the Hearth","context":"The Cloister and the Hearth\n Married to Margaret Brandt, Gerard sets off to Rome from Holland in order to escape the persecution of a vicious burgomaster as well as to earn money for the support of his family. Margaret awaits his return in Holland and in the meantime gives birth to his son. As Gerard is the favourite with his parents, his two lazy and jealous brothers decide to divert him from Holland and receive a larger share of fortune after their parents' death. They compose and dispatch a letter to Gerard informing him falsely that Margaret has died. Gerard believes the news and, stricken by grief, gives himself to a dissolute life and even attempts a suicide. After being saved from death by chance, he takes vows and becomes a Dominican friar. Later Gerard preaches throughout Europe and, while in Holland, discovers that Margaret is alive. He is afraid of temptation and in order to shun Margaret becomes a hermit. Margaret discovers Gerard's hiding place and convinces him to come back to normal life in which he becomes a vicar of a small town. Gerard and Margaret no longer live as a man and wife, but nevertheless see each other several times a week. A few years pass, Gerard's son grows up and is sent to a private school. Later, having heard that plague breaks out at the school, Margaret rushes to rescue her son, but contracts the disease herself and dies shortly afterwards. Gerard takes her demise painfully, renounces his vicarship and dies in a few weeks.\nThe author of The Cloister and the Hearth, at the end of this story, reveals that Margaret's and Gerard's son, also named Gerard, became the great Catholic scholar and Humanist, Erasmus of Rotterdam, a major historical figure. Indeed, little is actually known about Erasmus' actual parentage (apparently illegitimate), though his parents were in reality named Margaret Roger and Gerard. Reade was apparently using his imagination to fill in some historical gaps in Erasmus' background. The Cloister and the Hearth can easily be read as anti-Catholic, as it presents Catholic discipline regarding the celibate priesthood as an unsympathetic obstacle preventing Margaret's and Gerard's love from continuing to be consummated.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Cloister and the Hearth, by Charles Reade\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

These two sentiments have cost me more than a year's very\nhard labour, which I venture to think has not been wasted. After this\nplain statement I trust all who comment on this work will see that to\ndescribe it as a reprint would be unfair to the public and to me. The\nEnglish language is copious, and, in any true man's hands, quite able\nto convey the truth--namely, that one-fifth of the present work is a\nreprint, and four-fifths of it a new composition.\n\nCHARLES READE\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nNot a day passes over the earth, but men and women of no note do great\ndeeds, speak great words, and suffer noble sorrows. Of these obscure\nheroes, philosophers, and martyrs, the greater part will never be known\ntill that hour, when many that are great shall be small, and the small\ngreat; but of others the world's knowledge may be said to sleep: their\nlives and characters lie hidden from nations in the annals that record\nthem. The general reader cannot feel them, they are presented so curtly\nand coldly: they are not like breathing stories appealing to his heart,\nbut little historic hail-stones striking him but to glance off his\nbosom: nor can he understand them; for epitomes are not narratives, as\nskeletons are not human figures.\n\nThus records of prime truths remain a dead letter to plain folk: the\nwriters have left so much to the imagination, and imagination is so\nrare a gift. Here, then, the writer of fiction may be of use to the\npublic--as an interpreter.\n\nThere is a musty chronicle, written in intolerable Latin, and in it\na chapter where every sentence holds a fact. Here is told, with harsh\nbrevity, the strange history of a pair, who lived untrumpeted, and died\nunsung, four hundred years ago; and lie now, as unpitied, in that stern\npage, as fossils in a rock. Thus, living or dead, Fate is still unjust\nto them. For if I can but show you what lies below that dry chronicler's\nwords, methinks you will correct the indifference of centuries, and give\nthose two sore-tried souls a place in your heart--for a day.\n\nIt was past the middle of the fifteenth century; Louis XI was sovereign\nof France; Edward IV was wrongful king of England; and Philip \"the\nGood,\" having by force and cunning dispossessed his cousin Jacqueline,\nand broken her heart, reigned undisturbed this many years in Holland,\nwhere our tale begins.\n\nElias, and Catherine his wife, lived in the little town of Tergou. He\ntraded, wholesale and retail, in cloth, silk, brown holland, and,\nabove all, in curried leather, a material highly valued by the middling\npeople, because it would stand twenty years' wear, and turn an ordinary\nknife, no small virtue in a jerkin of that century, in which folk were\nso liberal of their steel; even at dinner a man would leave his meat\nawhile, and carve you his neighbour, on a very moderate difference of\nopinion.\n\nThe couple were well to do, and would have been free from all earthly\ncare, but for nine children. When these were coming into the world, one\nper annum, each was hailed with rejoicings, and the saints were thanked,\nnot expostulated with; and when parents and children were all young\ntogether, the latter were looked upon as lovely little playthings\ninvented by Heaven for the amusement, joy, and evening solace of people\nin business.\n\nBut as the olive-branches shot up, and the parents grew older, and saw\nwith their own eyes the fate of large families, misgivings and care\nmingled with their love. They belonged to a singularly wise and\nprovident people: in Holland reckless parents were as rare as\ndisobedient children. So now when the huge loaf came in on a gigantic\ntrencher, looking like a fortress in its moat, and, the tour of the\ntable once made, seemed to have melted away, Elias and Catherine would\nlook at one another and say, \"Who is to find bread for them all when we\nare gone?\"\n\nAt this observation the younger ones needed all their filial respect to\nkeep their little Dutch countenances; for in their opinion dinner and\nsupper came by nature like sunrise and sunset, and, so long as that\nluminary should travel round the earth, so long as the brown loaf go\nround their family circle, and set in their stomachs only to rise again\nin the family oven. But the remark awakened the national thoughtfulness\nof the elder boys, and being often repeated, set several of the family\nthinking, some of them good thoughts, some ill thoughts, according to\nthe nature of the thinkers.\n\n\"Kate, the children grow so, this table will soon be too small.\"\n\n\"We cannot afford it, Eli,\" replied Catherine, answering not his words,\nbut his thought, after the manner of women.\n\nTheir anxiety for the future took at times a less dismal but more\nmortifying turn. The free burghers had their pride as well as the\nnobles; and these two could not bear that any of their blood should go\ndown in the burgh after their decease.\n\nSo by prudence and self-denial they managed to clothe all the little\nbodies, and feed all the great mouths, and yet put by a small hoard\nto meet the future; and, as it grew and grew, they felt a pleasure the\nmiser hoarding for himself knows not.\n\nOne day the eldest boy but one, aged nineteen, came to his mother, and,\nwith that outward composure which has so misled some persons as to the\nreal nature of this people, begged her to intercede with his father to\nsend him to Amsterdam, and place him with a merchant. \"It is the way\nof life that likes me: merchants are wealthy; I am good at numbers;\nprithee, good mother, take my part in this, and I shall ever be, as I am\nnow, your debtor.\"\n\nCatherine threw up her hands with dismay and incredulity.\n\n\"What! leave Tergou!\"\n\n\"What is one street to me more than another? If I can leave the folk of\nTergou, I can surely leave the stones.\"\n\n\"What! quit your poor father now he is no longer young?\"\n\n\"Mother, if I can leave you, I can leave\"\n\n\"What! leave your poor brothers and sisters, that love you so dear?\"\n\n\"There are enough in the house without me.\"\n\n\"What mean you, Richart? Who is more thought of than you Stay, have I\nspoken sharp to you? Have I been unkind to you?\"\n\n\"Never that I know of; and if you had, you should never hear of it from\nme. Mother,\" said Richart gravely, but the tear was in his eye, \"it all\nlies in a word, and nothing can change my mind. There will be one mouth\nless for you to feed.'\n\n\"There now, see what my tongue has done,\" said Catherine, and the next\nmoment she began to cry. For she saw her first young bird on the edge\nof the nest trying his wings to fly into the world. Richart had a calm,\nstrong will, and she knew he never wasted a word.\n\nIt ended as nature has willed all such discourse shall end: young\nRichart went to Amsterdam with a face so long and sad as it had never\nbeen seen before, and a heart like granite.\n\nThat afternoon at supper there was one mouth less. Catherine looked at\nRichart's chair and wept bitterly. On this Elias shouted roughly and\nangrily to the children, \"Sit wider, can't ye: sit wider!\" and turned\nhis head away over the back of his seat awhile, and was silent.\n\nRichart was launched, and never cost them another penny; but to fit him\nout and place him in the house of Vander Stegen, the merchant, took all\nthe little hoard but one gold crown. They began again. Two years passed,\nRichart found a niche in commerce for his brother Jacob, and Jacob left\nTergou directly after dinner, which was at eleven in the forenoon. At\nsupper that day Elias remembered what had happened the last time; so it\nwas in a low whisper he said, \"Sit wider, dears!\" Now until that moment,\nCatherine would not see the gap at table, for her daughter Catherine had\nbesought her not to grieve to-night, and she had said, \"No, sweetheart,\nI promise I will not, since it vexes my children.\" But when Elias\nwhispered \"Sit wider!\" says she, \"Ay! the table will soon be too big\nfor the children, and you thought it would be too small;\" and having\ndelivered this with forced calmness, she put up her apron the next\nmoment, and wept sore.\n\n\"'Tis the best that leave us,\" sobbed she; \"that is the cruel part.\"\n\n\"Nay! nay!\" said Elias, \"our children are good children, and all are\ndear to us alike. Heed her not! What God takes from us still seems\nbetter that what He spares to us; that is to say, men are by nature\nunthankful--and women silly.\"\n\n\"And I say Richart and Jacob were the flower of the flock,\" sobbed\nCatherine.\n\nThe little coffer was empty again, and to fill it they gathered\nlike ants. In those days speculation was pretty much confined to the\ncard-and-dice business. Elias knew no way to wealth but the slow and\nsure one. \"A penny saved is a penny gained,\" was his humble creed. All\nthat was not required for the business and the necessaries of life went\ninto the little coffer with steel bands and florid key. They denied\nthemselves in turn the humblest luxuries, and then, catching one\nanother's looks, smiled; perhaps with a greater joy than self-indulgence\nhas to bestow. And so in three years more they had gleaned enough to set\nup their fourth son as a master-tailor, and their eldest daughter as a\nrobemaker, in Tergou. Here were two more provided for: their own trade\nwould enable them to throw work into the hands of this pair. But the\ncoffer was drained to the dregs, and this time the shop too bled a\nlittle in goods if not in coin.\n\nAlas! there remained on hand two that were unable to get their bread,\nand two that were unwilling. The unable ones were, 1, Giles, a dwarf,\nof the wrong sort, half stupidity, half malice, all head and claws and\nvoice, run from by dogs and unprejudiced females, and sided with through\nthick and thin by his mother; 2, Little Catherine, a poor little girl\nthat could only move on crutches. She lived in pain, but smiled through\nit, with her marble face and violet eyes and long silky lashes; and\nfretful or repining word never came from her lips. The unwilling ones\nwere Sybrandt, the youngest, a ne'er-do-weel, too much in love with play\nto work; and Cornelis, the eldest, who had made calculations, and stuck\nto the hearth, waiting for dead men's shoes. Almost worn out by their\nrepeated efforts, and above all dispirited by the moral and physical\ninfirmities of those that now remained on hand, the anxious couple would\noften say, \"What will become of all these when we shall be no longer\nhere to take care of them?\" But when they had said this a good many\ntimes, suddenly the domestic horizon cleared, and then they used\nstill to say it, because a habit is a habit, but they uttered it half\nmechanically now, and added brightly and cheerfully, \"But thanks to St.\nBavon and all the saints, there's Gerard.\"\n\nYoung Gerard was for many years of his life a son apart and he was going\ninto the Church, and the Church could always maintain her children by\nhook or by crook in those days: no great hopes, because his family had\nno interest with the great to get him a benefice, and the young man's\nown habits were frivolous, and, indeed, such as our cloth merchant\nwould not have put up with in any one but a clerk that was to be. His\ntrivialities were reading and penmanship, and he was so wrapped up in\nthem that often he could hardly be got away to his meals. The day\nwas never long enough for him; and he carried ever a tinder-box and\nbrimstone matches, and begged ends of candles of the neighbours, which\nhe lighted at unreasonable hours--ay, even at eight of the clock at\nnight in winter, when the very burgomaster was abed. Endured at home,\nhis practices were encouraged by the monks of a neighbouring convent.\nThey had taught him penmanship, and continued to teach him until one day\nthey discovered, in the middle of a lesson, that he was teaching them.\nThey pointed this out to him in a merry way: he hung his head and\nblushed: he had suspected as much himself, but mistrusted his judgment\nin so delicate a matter. \"But, my son,\" said an elderly monk, \"how is\nit that you, to whom God has given an eye so true, a hand so subtle yet\nfirm, and a heart to love these beautiful crafts, how is it you do not\ncolour as well as write? A scroll looks but barren unless a border of\nfruit, and leaves, and rich arabesques surround the good words, and\ncharm the sense as those do the soul and understanding; to say nothing\nof the pictures of holy men and women departed, with which the several\nchapters should be adorned, and not alone the eye soothed with the brave\nand sweetly blended colours, but the heart lifted by effigies of the\nsaints in glory. Answer me, my son.\"\n\nAt this Gerard was confused, and muttered that he had made several\ntrials at illuminating, but had not succeeded well; and thus the matter\nrested.\n\nSoon after this a fellow-enthusiast came on the scene in the unwonted\nform of an old lady. Margaret, sister and survivor of the brothers Van\nEyck, left Flanders, and came to end her days in her native country. She\nbought a small house near Tergou. In course of time she heard of Gerard,\nand saw some of his handiwork: it pleased her so well that she sent her\nfemale servant, Reicht Heynes, to ask him to come to her. This led to an\nacquaintance: it could hardly be otherwise, for little Tergou had never\nheld so many as two zealots of this sort before. At first the old lady\ndamped Gerard's courage terribly. At each visit she fished out of holes\nand corners drawings and paintings, some of them by her own hand, that\nseemed to him unapproachable; but if the artist overpowered him, the\nwoman kept his heart up. She and Reicht soon turned him inside out like\na glove: among other things, they drew from him what the good monks had\nfailed to hit upon, the reason why he did not illuminate, viz., that\nhe could not afford the gold, the blue, and the red, but only the cheap\nearths; and that he was afraid to ask his mother to buy the choice\ncolours, and was sure he should ask her in vain. Then Margaret Van Eyck\ngave him a little brush--gold, and some vermilion and ultramarine, and\na piece of good vellum to lay them on. He almost adored her. As he left\nthe house Reicht ran after him with a candle and two quarters: he\nquite kissed her. But better even than the gold and lapis-lazuli to the\nilluminator was the sympathy to the isolated enthusiast. That sympathy\nwas always ready, and, as he returned it, an affection sprung up between\nthe old painter and the young caligrapher that was doubly characteristic\nof the time. For this was a century in which the fine arts and the\nhigher mechanical arts were not separated by any distinct boundary, nor\nwere those who practised them; and it was an age in which artists sought\nout and loved one another. Should this last statement stagger a painter\nor writer of our day, let me remind him that even Christians loved one\nanother at first starting.\n\nBacked by an acquaintance so venerable, and strengthened by female\nsympathy, Gerard advanced in learning and skill. His spirits, too, rose\nvisibly: he still looked behind him when dragged to dinner in the\nmiddle of an initial G; but once seated, showed great social qualities;\nlikewise a gay humour, that had hitherto but peeped in him, shone out,\nand often he set the table in a roar, and kept it there, sometimes with\nhis own wit, sometimes with jests which were glossy new to his family,\nbeing drawn from antiquity.\n\nAs a return for all he owed his friends the monks, he made them\nexquisite copies from two of their choicest MSS., viz., the life of\ntheir founder, and their Comedies of Terence, the monastery finding the\nvellum.\n\nThe high and puissant Prince, Philip \"the Good,\" Duke of Burgundy,\nLuxemburg, and Brabant, Earl of Holland and Zealand, Lord of Friesland,\nCount of Flanders, Artois, and Hainault, Lord of Salins and Macklyn--was\nversatile.\n\nHe could fight as well as any king going; and lie could lie as well as\nany, except the King of France. He was a mighty hunter, and could read\nand write. His tastes were wide and ardent. He loved jewels like a\nwoman, and gorgeous apparel. He dearly loved maids of honour, and indeed\npaintings generally; in proof of which he ennobled Jan Van Eyck. He had\nalso a rage for giants, dwarfs, and Turks. These last stood ever planted\nabout him, turbaned and blazing with jewels. His agents inveigled them\nfrom Istamboul with fair promises; but the moment he had got them, he\nbaptized them by brute force in a large tub; and this done, let them\nsquat with their faces towards Mecca, and invoke Mahound as much as they\npleased, laughing in his sleeve at their simplicity in fancying they\nwere still infidels. He had lions in cages, and fleet leopards trained\nby Orientals to run down hares and deer. In short, he relished all\nrarities, except the humdrum virtues. For anything singularly pretty or\ndiabolically ugly, this was your customer. The best of him was, he was\nopenhanded to the poor; and the next best was, he fostered the arts in\nearnest: whereof he now gave a signal proof. He offered prizes for the\nbest specimens of orfevrerie in two kinds, religious and secular: item,\nfor the best paintings in white of egg, oils, and tempera; these to\nbe on panel, silk, or metal, as the artists chose: item, for the best\ntransparent painting on glass: item, for the best illuminating and\nborder-painting on vellum: item, for the fairest writing on vellum. The\nburgomasters of the several towns were commanded to aid all the poorer\ncompetitors by receiving their specimens and sending them with due care\nto Rotterdam at the expense of their several burghs. When this was cried\nby the bellman through the streets of Tergou, a thousand mouths opened,\nand one heart beat--Gerard's. He told his family timidly he should try\nfor two of those prizes. They stared in silence, for their breath was\ngone at his audacity; but one horrid laugh exploded on the floor like\na petard. Gerard looked down, and there was the dwarf, slit and fanged\nfrom ear to ear at his expense, and laughing like a lion. Nature,\nrelenting at having made Giles so small, had given him as a set-off the\nbiggest voice on record. His very whisper was a bassoon. He was like\nthose stunted wide-mouthed pieces of ordnance we see on fortifications;\nmore like a flower-pot than a cannon; but ods tympana how they bellow!\n\nGerard turned red with anger, the more so as the others began to titter.\nWhite Catherine saw, and a pink tinge came on her cheek. She said\nsoftly, \"Why do you laugh? Is it because he is our brother you think\nhe cannot be capable? Yes, Gerard, try with the rest. Many say you are\nskilful; and mother and I will pray the Virgin to guide your hand.\"\n\n\"Thank you, little Kate. You shall pray to our Lady, and our mother\nshall buy me vellum and the colours to illuminate with.\"\n\n\"What will they cost, my lad?\"\n\n\"Two gold crowns\" (about three shillings and fourpence English money).\n\n\"What!\" screamed the housewife, \"when the bushel of rye costs but a\ngroat! What! me spend a month's meal and meat and fire on such vanity as\nthat: the lightning from Heaven would fall on me, and my children would\nall be beggars.\"\n\n\"Mother!\" sighed little Catherine, imploringly.\n\n\"Oh! it is in vain, Kate,\" said Gerard, with a sigh. \"I shall have to\ngive it up, or ask the dame Van Eyck. She would give it me, but I think\nshame to be for ever taking from her.\"\n\n\"It is not her affair,\" said Catherine, very sharply; \"what has she to\ndo coming between me and my son?\" and she left the room with a red\nface. Little Catherine smiled. Presently the housewife returned with a\ngracious, affectionate air, and two little gold pieces in her hand.\n\n\"There, sweetheart,\" said she, \"you won't have to trouble dame or\ndemoiselle for two paltry crowns.\"\n\nBut on this Gerard fell a thinking how he could spare her purse.\n\n\"One will do, mother. I will ask the good monks to let me send my copy\nof their 'Terence:' it is on snowy vellum, and I can write no better:\nso then I shall only need six sheets of vellum for my borders and\nminiatures, and gold for my ground, and prime colours--one crown will\ndo.'\n\n\"Never tyne the ship for want of a bit of tar, Gerard,\" said his\nchangeable mother. But she added, \"Well, there, I will put the crown in\nmy pocket. That won't be like putting it back in the box. Going to the\nbox to take out instead of putting in, it is like going to my heart with\na knife for so many drops of blood. You will be sure to want it, Gerard.\nThe house is never built for less than the builder counted on.\"\n\nSure enough, when the time came, Gerard longed to go to Rotterdam and\nsee the Duke, and above all to see the work of his competitors, and\nso get a lesson from defeat. And the crown came out of the housewife's\npocket with a very good grace. Gerard would soon be a priest. It seemed\nhard if he might not enjoy the world a little before separating himself\nfrom it for life.\n\nThe night before he went, Margaret Van Eyck asked him to take a letter\nfor her, and when he came to look at it, to his surprise he found it was\naddressed to the Princess Marie, at the Stadthouse in Rotterdam.\n\nThe day before the prizes were to be distributed, Gerard started for\nRotterdam in his holiday suit, to wit, a doublet of silver-grey cloth,\nwith sleeves, and a jerkin of the same over it, but without sleeves.\nFrom his waist to his heels he was clad in a pair of tight-fitting\nbuckskin hose fastened by laces (called points) to his doublet. His\nshoes were pointed, in moderation, and secured by a strap that passed\nunder the hollow of the foot. On his head and the back of his neck he\nwore his flowing hair, and pinned to his back between his shoulders was\nhis hat: it was further secured by a purple silk ribbon little Kate had\npassed round him from the sides of the hat, and knotted neatly on\nhis breast; below his hat, attached to the upper rim of his broad\nwaist-belt, was his leathern wallet. When he got within a league of\nRotterdam he was pretty tired, but he soon fell in with a pair that were\nmore so. He found an old man sitting by the roadside quite worn out, and\na comely young woman holding his hand, with a face brimful of concern.\nThe country people trudged by, and noticed nothing amiss; but Gerard, as\nhe passed, drew conclusions. Even dress tells a tale to those who study\nit so closely as he did, being an illuminator. The old man wore a gown,\nand a fur tippet, and a velvet cap, sure signs of dignity; but the\ntriangular purse at his girdle was lean, the gown rusty, the fur worn,\nsure signs of poverty. The young woman was dressed in plain russet\ncloth: yet snow-white lawn covered that part of her neck the gown left\nvisible, and ended half way up her white throat in a little band of gold\nembroidery; and her head-dress was new to Gerard: instead of hiding her\nhair in a pile of linen or lawn, she wore an open network of silver cord\nwith silver spangles at the interstices: in this her glossy auburn hair\nwas rolled in front into two solid waves, and supported behind in a\nluxurious and shapely mass. His quick eye took in all this, and the old\nman's pallor, and the tears in the young woman's eyes. So when he had\npassed them a few yards, he reflected, and turned back, and came towards\nthem bashfully.\n\n\"Father, I fear you are tired.\"\n\n\"Indeed, my son, I am,\" replied the old man, \"and faint for lack of\nfood.\"\n\nGerard's address did not appear so agreeable to the girl as to the old\nman. She seemed ashamed, and with much reserve in her manner, said,\nthat it was her fault--she had underrated the distance, and imprudently\nallowed her father to start too late in the day.\n\n\"No, no,\" said the old man; \"it is not the distance, it is the want of\nnourishment.\"\n\nThe girl put her arms round his neck with tender concern, but took that\nopportunity of whispering, \"Father, a stranger--a young man!\"\n\nBut it was too late. Gerard, with simplicity, and quite as a matter of\ncourse, fell to gathering sticks with great expedition. This done, he\ntook down his wallet, out with the manchet of bread and the iron flask\nhis careful mother had put up, and his everlasting tinder-box; lighted a\nmatch, then a candle-end, then the sticks; and put his iron flask on it.\nThen down he went on his stomach, and took a good blow: then looking up,\nhe saw the girl's face had thawed, and she was looking down at him and\nhis energy with a demure smile. He laughed back to her. \"Mind the pot,\"\nsaid he, \"and don't let it spill, for Heaven's sake: there's a cleft\nstick to hold it safe with;\" and with this he set off running towards a\ncorn-field at some distance.\n\nWhilst he was gone, there came by, on a mule with rich purple housings,\nan old man redolent of wealth. The purse at his girdle was plethoric,\nthe fur on his tippet was ermine, broad and new.\n\nIt was Ghysbrecht Van Swieten, the burgomaster of Tergou.\n\nHe was old, and his face furrowed. He was a notorious miser, and looked\none generally. But the idea of supping with the Duke raised him just now\ninto manifest complacency. Yet at the sight of the faded old man and his\nbright daughter sitting by a fire of sticks, the smile died out of his\nface, and he wore a strange look of pain and uneasiness. He reined in\nhis mule.\n\n\"Why, Peter,--Margaret,\" said he, almost fiercely, \"what mummery is\nthis?\" Peter was going to answer, but Margaret interposed hastily, and\nsaid: \"My father was exhausted, so I am warming something to give him\nstrength before we go on.\"\n\n\"What! reduced to feed by the roadside like the Bohemians,\" said\nGhysbrecht, and his hand went into his purse; but it did not seem at\nhome there; it fumbled uncertainly, afraid too large a coin might stick\nto a finger and come out.\n\nAt this moment who should come bounding up but Gerard. He had two straws\nin his hand, and he threw himself down by the fire and relieved Margaret\nof the cooking part: then suddenly recognizing the burgomaster, he\ncoloured all over. Ghysbrecht Van Swieten started and glared at him,\nand took his hand out of his purse. \"Oh!\" said he bitterly, \"I am\nnot wanted,\" and went slowly on, casting a long look of suspicion on\nMargaret, and hostility on Gerard, that was not very intelligible.\nHowever, there was something about it that Margaret could read enough\nto blush at, and almost toss her head. Gerard only stared with surprise.\n\"By St. Bavon, I think the old miser grudges us three our quart\nof soup,\" said he. When the young man put that interpretation on\nGhysbrecht's strange and meaning look, Margaret was greatly relieved,\nand smiled gaily on the speaker.\n\nMeanwhile Ghysbrecht plodded on, more wretched in his wealth than these\nin their poverty. And the curious thing is, that the mule, the purple\nhousings, and one-half the coin in that plethoric purse, belonged not to\nGhysbrecht Van Swieten, but to that faded old man and that comely girl,\nwho sat by a roadside fire to be fed by a stranger. They did not know\nthis; but Ghysbrecht knew it, and carried in his heart a scorpion of\nhis own begetting; that scorpion is remorse--the remorse that, not\nbeing penitence, is incurable, and ready for fresh misdeeds upon a fresh\ntemptation.\n\nTwenty years ago, when Ghysbrecht Van Swieten was a hard and honest man,\nthe touchstone opportunity came to him, and he did an act of heartless\nroguery. It seemed a safe one. It had hitherto proved a safe one, though\nhe had never felt safe. To-day he had seen youth, enterprise, and, above\nall, knowledge, seated by fair Margaret and her father on terms that\nlook familiar and loving.\n\nAnd the fiends are at big ear again.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\"The soup is hot,\" said Gerard.\n\n\"But how are we to get it to our mouths?\" inquired the senior,\ndespondingly.\n\n\"Father, the young man has brought us straws.\" And Margaret smiled\nslily.\n\n\"Ay, ay!\" said the old man; \"but my poor bones are stiff, and indeed the\nfire is too hot for a body to kneel over with these short straws. St.\nJohn the Baptist, but the young man is adroit!\"\n\nFor, while he stated his difficulty, Gerard removed it. He untied in a\nmoment the knot on his breast, took his hat off, put a stone into each\ncorner of it, then, wrapping his hand in the tail of his jerkin, whipped\nthe flask off the fire, wedged it in between the stones, and put the\nhat under the old man's nose with a merry smile. The other tremulously\ninserted the pipe of rye-straw and sucked. Lo and behold, his wan, drawn\nface was seen to light up more and more, till it quite glowed; and as\nsoon as he had drawn a long breath:\n\n\"Hippocrates and Galen!\" he cried, \"'tis a soupe au vin--the restorative\nof restoratives. Blessed be the nation that invented it, and the woman\nthat made it, and the young man who brings it to fainting folk. Have a\nsuck, my girl, while I relate to our young host the history and virtues\nof this his sovereign compound. This corroborative, young sir, was\nunknown to the ancients: we find it neither in their treatises of\nmedicine, nor in those popular narratives, which reveal many of their\nremedies, both in chirurgery and medicine proper. Hector, in the Ilias,\nif my memory does not play me false--\n\n(Margaret. \"Alas! he's off.\")\n\n----was invited by one of the ladies of the poem to drink a draught of\nwine; but he declined, on the plea that he was just going into battle,\nand must not take aught to weaken his powers. Now, if the soupe au vin\nhad been known in Troy, it is clear that in declining vinum merum upon\nthat score, he would have added in the hexameter, 'But a soupe au vin,\nmadam, I will degust, and gratefully.' Not only would this have been but\ncommon civility--a virtue no perfect commander is wanting in--but not\nto have done it would have proved him a shallow and improvident person,\nunfit to be trusted with the conduct of a war; for men going into a\nbattle need sustenance and all possible support, as is proved by this,\nthat foolish generals, bringing hungry soldiers to blows with full ones,\nhave been defeated, in all ages, by inferior numbers. The Romans lost\na great battle in the north of Italy to Hannibal, the Carthaginian, by\nthis neglect alone. Now, this divine elixir gives in one moment force to\nthe limbs and ardour to the spirits; and taken into Hector's body at\nthe nick of time, would, by the aid of Phoebus, Venus, and the blessed\nsaints, have most likely procured the Greeks a defeat. For note how\nfaint and weary and heart-sick I was a minute ago; well, I suck this\ncelestial cordial, and now behold me brave as Achilles and strong as an\neagle.\"\n\n\"Oh, father, now? an eagle, alack!\"\n\n\"Girl, I defy thee and all the world. Ready, I say, like a foaming\ncharger, to devour the space between this and Rotterdam, and strong\nto combat the ills of life, even poverty and old age, which last\nphilosophers have called the summum malum. Negatur; unless the man's\nlife has been ill-spent--which, by the bye, it generally has. Now for\nthe moderns!\"\n\n\"Father! dear father!\"\n\n\"Fear me not, girl; I will be brief, unreasonably and unseasonably\nbrief. The soupe au vin occurs not in modern science; but this is only\none proof more, if proof were needed, that for the last few hundred\nyears physicians have been idiots, with their chicken-broth and their\ndecoction of gold, whereby they attribute the highest qualities to that\nmeat which has the least juice of any meat, and to that metal which\nhas less chemical qualities than all the metals; mountebanks! dunces!\nhomicides! Since, then, from these no light is to be gathered, go we\nto the chroniclers; and first we find that Duguesclin, a French knight,\nbeing about to join battle with the English--masters, at that time, of\nhalf France, and sturdy strikers by sea and land--drank, not one, but\nthree soupes au vin in honour of the Blessed Trinity. This done, he\ncharged the islanders; and, as might have been foretold, killed a\nmultitude, and drove the rest into the sea. But he was only the first\nof a long list of holy and hard-hitting ones who have, by this divine\nrestorative, been sustentated, fortified, corroborated, and consoled.\"\n\n\"Dear father, prithee add thyself to that venerable company ere the\nsoup cools.\" And Margaret held the hat imploringly in both hands till he\ninserted the straw once more.\n\nThis spared them the \"modern instances,\" and gave Gerard an opportunity\nof telling Margaret how proud his mother would be her soup had profited\na man of learning.\n\n\"Ay! but,\" said Margaret, \"it would like her ill to see her son give all\nand take none himself. Why brought you but two straws?\"\n\n\"Fair mistress, I hoped you would let me put my lips to your straw,\nthere being but two.\"\n\nMargaret smiled and blushed. \"Never beg that you may command,\" said she.\n\"The straw is not mine, 'tis yours: you cut it in yonder field.\"\n\n\"I cut it, and that made it mine; but after that, your lip touched it,\nand that made it yours.\"\n\n\"Did it Then I will lend it you. There--now it is yours again; your lip\nhas touched it.\"\n\n\"No, it belongs to us both now. Let us divide it.\"\n\n\"By all means; you have a knife.\"\n\n\"No, I will not cut it--that would be unlucky. I'll bite it. There I\nshall keep my half: you will burn yours, once you get home, I doubt.'\n\n\"You know me not. I waste nothing. It is odds but I make a hairpin of\nit, or something.\"\n\nThis answer dashed the novice Gerard, instead of provoking him, to fresh\nefforts, and he was silent. And now, the bread and soup being disposed\nof, the old scholar prepared to continue his journey. Then came a\nlittle difficulty: Gerard the adroit could not tie his ribbon again as\nCatherine had tied it. Margaret, after slily eyeing his efforts for\nsome time, offered to help him; for at her age girls love to be coy and\ntender, saucy and gentle, by turns, and she saw she had put him out of\ncountenance but now. Then a fair head, with its stately crown of auburn\nhair, glossy and glowing through silver, bowed sweetly towards him; and,\nwhile it ravished his eye, two white supple hands played delicately upon\nthe stubborn ribbon, and moulded it with soft and airy touches. Then a\nheavenly thrill ran through the innocent young man, and vague glimpses\nof a new world of feeling and sentiment opened on him. And these new and\nexquisite sensations Margaret unwittingly prolonged: it is not natural\nto her sex to hurry aught that pertains to the sacred toilet. Nay, when\nthe taper fingers had at last subjugated the ends of the knot, her mind\nwas not quite easy, till, by a manoeuvre peculiar to the female hand,\nshe had made her palm convex, and so applied it with a gentle pressure\nto the centre of the knot--a sweet little coaxing hand-kiss, as much as\nto say, \"Now be a good knot, and stay so.\" The palm-kiss was bestowed on\nthe ribbon, but the wearer's heart leaped to meet it.\n\n\"There, that is how it was,\" said Margaret, and drew back to take one\nlast keen survey of her work; then, looking up for simple approval\nof her skill, received full in her eyes a longing gaze of such ardent\nadoration, as made her lower them quickly and colour all over. An\nindescribable tremor seized her, and she retreated with downcast lashes\nand tell-tale cheeks, and took her father's arm on the opposite side.\nGerard, blushing at having scared her away with his eyes, took the\nother arm; and so the two young things went downcast and conscious, and\npropped the eagle along in silence.\n\nThey entered Rotterdam by the Schiedamze Poort; and, as Gerard was\nunacquainted with the town, Peter directed him the way to the Hooch\nStraet, in which the Stadthouse was. He himself was going with Margaret\nto his cousin, in the Ooster-Waagen Straet, so, almost on entering the\ngate, their roads lay apart. They bade each other a friendly adieu, and\nGerard dived into the great town. A profound sense of solitude fell upon\nhim, yet the streets were crowded. Then he lamented too late that, out\nof delicacy, he had not asked his late companions who they were and\nwhere they lived.\n\n\"Beshrew my shamefacedness!\" said he. \"But their words and their\nbreeding were above their means, and something did whisper me they would\nnot be known. I shall never see her more. Oh weary world, I hate you and\nyour ways. To think I must meet beauty and goodness and learning--three\npearls of price--and never see them more!\"\n\nFalling into this sad reverie, and letting his body go where it would,\nhe lost his way; but presently meeting a crowd of persons all moving in\none direction, he mingled with them, for he argued they must be making\nfor the Stadthouse. Soon the noisy troop that contained the moody Gerard\nemerged, not upon the Stadthouse, but upon a large meadow by the side of\nthe Maas; and then the attraction was revealed. Games of all sorts\nwere going on: wrestling, the game of palm, the quintain, legerdemain,\narchery, tumbling, in which art, I blush to say, women as well as men\nperformed, to the great delectation of the company. There was also a\ntrained bear, who stood on his head, and marched upright, and bowed with\nprodigious gravity to his master; and a hare that beat a drum, and a\ncock that strutted on little stilts disdainfully. These things made\nGerard laugh now and then; but the gay scene could not really enliven\nit, for his heart was not in tune with it. So hearing a young man say\nto his fellow that the Duke had been in the meadow, but was gone to\nthe Stadthouse to entertain the burgomasters and aldermen and the\ncompetitors for the prizes, and their friends, he suddenly remembered\nhe was hungry, and should like to sup with a prince. He left the\nriver-side, and this time he found the Hooch Straet, and it speedily led\nhim to the Stadthouse. But when he got there he was refused, first\nat one door, then at another, till he came to the great gate of the\ncourtyard. It was kept by soldiers, and superintended by a pompous\nmajor-domo, glittering in an embroidered collar and a gold chain of\noffice, and holding a white staff with a gold knob. There was a crowd of\npersons at the gate endeavouring to soften this official rock. They came\nup in turn like ripples, and retired as such in turn. It cost Gerard a\nstruggle to get near him, and when he was within four heads of the\ngate, he saw something that made his heart beat; there was Peter, with\nMargaret on his arm, soliciting humbly for entrance.\n\n\"My cousin the alderman is not at home; they say he is here.\"\n\n\"What is that to me, old man?\"\n\n\"If you will not let us pass in to him, at least take this leaf from my\ntablet to my cousin. See, I have written his name; he will come out to\nus.\n\n\"For what do you take me? I carry no messages, I keep the gate.\"\n\nHe then bawled, in a stentorian voice, inexorably:\n\n\"No strangers enter here, but the competitors and their companies.\"\n\n\"Come, old man,\" cried a voice in the crowd, \"you have gotten your\nanswer; make way.\"\n\nMargaret turned half round imploringly:\n\n\"Good people, we are come from far, and my father is old; and my cousin\nhas a new servant that knows us not, and would not let us sit in our\ncousin's house.\"\n\nAt this the crowd laughed hoarsely. Margaret shrank as if they had\nstruck her. At that moment a hand grasped hers--a magic grasp; it felt\nlike heart meeting heart, or magnet steel. She turned quickly round at\nit, and it was Gerard. Such a little cry of joy and appeal came from her\nbosom, and she began to whimper prettily.\n\nThey had hustled her and frightened her, for one thing; and her cousin's\nthoughtlessness, in not even telling his servant they were coming,\nwas cruel; and the servant's caution, however wise and faithful to her\nmaster, was bitterly mortifying to her father and her. And to her so\nmortified, and anxious and jostled, came suddenly this kind hand and\nface. \"Hinc illae lacrimae.\"\n\n\"All is well now,\" remarked a coarse humourist; \"she hath gotten her\nsweetheart.\"\n\n\"Haw! haw! haw!\" went the crowd.\n\nShe dropped Gerard's hand directly, and turned round, with eyes flashing\nthrough her tears:\n\n\"I have no sweetheart, you rude men. But I am friendless in your boorish\ntown, and this is a friend; and one who knows, what you know not, how to\ntreat the aged and the weak.\"\n\nThe crowd was dead silent. They had only been thoughtless, and now felt\nthe rebuke, though severe, was just. The silence enabled Gerard to treat\nwith the porter.\n\n\"I am a competitor, sir.\"\n\n\"What is your name?\" and the man eyed him suspiciously.\n\n\"Gerard, the son of Elias.\"\n\nThe janitor inspected a slip of parchment he held in his hand:\n\n\"Gerard Eliassoen can enter.\"\n\n\"With my company, these two?\"\n\n\"Nay; those are not your company they came before you.\"\n\n\"What matter? They are my friends, and without them I go not in.\"\n\n\"Stay without, then.\"\n\n\"That will I not.\"\n\n\"That we shall see.\"\n\n\"We will, and speedily.\" And with this, Gerard raised a voice of\nastounding volume and power, and routed so that the whole street rang:\n\n\"Ho! PHILIP, EARL OF HOLLAND!\"\n\n\"Are you mad?\" cried the porter.\n\n\"HERE IS ONE OF YOUR VARLETS DEFIES YOU.\"\n\n\"Hush, hush!\"\n\n\"AND WILL NOT LET YOUR GUESTS PASS IN.\"\n\n\"Hush! murder! The Dukes there. I'm dead,\" cried the janitor, quaking.\n\nThen suddenly trying to overpower Gerard's thunder, he shouted, with all\nhis lungs:\n\n\"OPEN THE GATE, YE KNAVES! WAY THERE FOR GERARD ELIASSOEN AND HIS\nCOMPANY! (The fiends go with him!)\"\n\nThe gate swung open as by magic. Eight soldiers lowered their pikes\nhalfway, and made an arch, under which the victorious three marched\nin triumphant. The moment they had passed, the pikes clashed together\nhorizontally to bar the gateway, and all but pinned an abdominal citizen\nthat sought to wedge in along with them.\n\nOnce past the guarded portal, a few steps brought the trio upon a scene\nof Oriental luxury. The courtyard was laid out in tables loaded with\nrich meats and piled with gorgeous plate. Guests in rich and various\ncostumes sat beneath a leafy canopy of fresh-cut branches fastened\ntastefully to golden, silver, and blue silken cords that traversed the\narea; and fruits of many hues, including some artificial ones of gold,\nsilver, and wax, hung pendant, or peeped like fair eyes among the green\nleaves of plane-trees and lime-trees. The Duke's minstrels swept their\nlutes at intervals, and a fountain played red Burgundy in six jets that\nmet and battled in the air. The evening sun darted its fires through\nthose bright and purple wine spouts, making them jets and cascades of\nmolten rubies, then passing on, tinged with the blood of the grape,\nshed crimson glories here and there on fair faces, snowy beards, velvet,\nsatin, jewelled hilts, glowing gold, gleaming silver, and sparkling\nglass. Gerard and his friends stood dazzled, spell-bound. Presently\na whisper buzzed round them, \"Salute the Duke! Salute the Duke!\" They\nlooked up, and there on high, under the dais, was their sovereign,\nbidding them welcome with a kindly wave of the hand. The men bowed low,\nand Margaret curtsied with a deep and graceful obeisance. The Duke's\nhand being up, he gave it another turn, and pointed the new-comers out\nto a knot of valets. Instantly seven of his people, with an obedient\nstart, went headlong at our friends, seated them at a table, and put\nfifteen many-coloured soups before them, in little silver bowls, and as\nmany wines in crystal vases.\n\n\"Nay, father, let us not eat until we have thanked our good friend,\"\nsaid Margaret, now first recovering from all this bustle.\n\n\"Girl, he is our guardian angel.\"\n\nGerard put his face into his hands.\n\n\"Tell me when you have done,\" said he, \"and I will reappear and have\nmy supper, for I am hungry. I know which of us three is the happiest at\nmeeting again.\"\n\n\"Me?\" inquired Margaret.\n\n\"No: guess again.\"\n\n\"Father?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then I have no guess which it can be;\" and she gave a little crow of\nhappiness and gaiety. The soup was tasted, and vanished in a twirl\nof fourteen hands, and fish came on the table in a dozen forms, with\npatties of lobster and almonds mixed, and of almonds and cream, and an\nimmense variety of brouets known to us as rissoles. The next trifle was\na wild boar, which smelt divine. Why, then, did Margaret start away from\nit with two shrieks of dismay, and pinch so good a friend as Gerard?\nBecause the Duke's cuisinier had been too clever; had made this\nexcellent dish too captivating to the sight as well as taste. He had\nrestored to the animal, by elaborate mimicry with burnt sugar and other\nedible colours, the hair and bristles he had robbed him of by fire and\nwater. To make him still more enticing, the huge tusks were carefully\npreserved in the brute's jaw, and gave his mouth the winning smile that\ncomes of tusk in man or beast; and two eyes of coloured sugar glowed\nin his head. St. Argus! what eyes! so bright, so bloodshot, so\nthreatening--they followed a man and every movement of his knife and\nspoon. But, indeed, I need the pencil of Granville or Tenniel to make\nyou see the two gilt valets on the opposite side of the table putting\nthe monster down before our friends, with a smiling, self-satisfied,\nbenevolent obsequiousness for this ghastly monster was the flower of all\ncomestibles--old Peter clasping both hands in pious admiration of\nit; Margaret wheeling round with horror-stricken eyes and her hand on\nGerard's shoulder, squeaking and pinching; his face of unwise delight at\nbeing pinched, the grizzly brute glaring sulkily on all, and the guests\ngrinning from ear to ear.\n\n\"What's to do?\" shouted the Duke, hearing the signals of female\ndistress. Seven of his people with a zealous start went headlong and\ntold him. He laughed and said, \"Give her of the beef-stuffing, then, and\nbring me Sir Boar.\" Benevolent monarch! The beef-stuffing was his own\nprivate dish. On these grand occasions an ox was roasted whole, and\nreserved for the poor. But this wise as well as charitable prince had\ndiscovered, that whatever venison, bares, lamb, poultry, etc., you\nskewered into that beef cavern, got cooked to perfection, retaining\ntheir own juices and receiving those of the reeking ox. These he called\nhis beef-stuffing, and took delight therein, as did now our trio;\nfor, at his word, seven of his people went headlong, and drove silver\ntridents into the steaming cave at random, and speared a kid, a cygnet,\nand a flock of wildfowl. These presently smoked before Gerard and\ncompany; and Peter's face, sad and slightly morose at the loss of the\nsavage hog, expanded and shone. After this, twenty different tarts of\nfruits and herbs, and last of all, confectionery on a Titanic scale;\ncathedrals of sugar, all gilt painted in the interstices of the\nbas-reliefs; castles with moats, and ditches imitated to the life;\nelephants, camels, toads; knights on horseback jousting; kings and\nprincesses looking on trumpeters blowing; and all these personages\neating, and their veins filled with sweet-scented juices: works of art\nmade to be destroyed. The guests breached a bastion, crunched a crusader\nand his horse and lance, or cracked a bishop, cope, chasuble, crosier\nand all, as remorselessly as we do a caraway comfit; sipping meanwhile\nhippocras and other spiced drinks, and Greek and Corsican wines, while\nevery now and then little Turkish boys, turbaned, spangled, jewelled,\nand gilt, came offering on bended knee golden troughs of rose-water and\norange-water to keep the guests' hands cool and perfumed.\n\nBut long before our party arrived at this final stage appetite had\nsuccumbed, and Gerard had suddenly remembered he was the bearer of a\nletter to the Princess Marie, and, in an under-tone, had asked one of\nthe servants if he would undertake to deliver it. The man took it with\na deep obeisance: \"He could not deliver it himself, but would instantly\ngive it one of the Princess's suite, several of whom were about.\"\n\nIt may be remembered that Peter and Margaret came here not to dine, but\nto find their cousin. Well, the old gentleman ate heartily, and--being\nmuch fatigued, dropped asleep, and forgot all about his cousin. Margaret\ndid not remind him; we shall hear why.\n\nMeanwhile, that Cousin was seated within a few feet of them, at their\nbacks, and discovered them when Margaret turned round and screamed\nat the boar. But he forbore to speak to them, for municipal reasons.\nMargaret was very plainly dressed, and Peter inclined to threadbare. So\nthe alderman said to himself:\n\n\"'Twill be time to make up to them when the sun sets and the company\ndisperses then I will take my poor relations to my house, and none will\nbe the wiser.\"\n\nHalf the courses were lost on Gerard and Margaret. They were no great\neaters, and just now were feeding on sweet thoughts that have ever been\nunfavourable to appetite. But there is a delicate kind of sensuality,\nto whose influence these two were perhaps more sensitive than any other\npair in that assembly--the delights of colour, music, and perfume, all\nof which blended so fascinatingly here.\n\nMargaret leaned back and half closed her eyes, and murmured to Gerard:\n\"What a lovely scene! the warm sun, the green shade, the rich dresses,\nthe bright music of the lutes and the cool music of the fountain, and\nall faces so happy and gay! and then, it is to you we owe it.\"\n\nGerard was silent all but his eyes; observing which--\n\n\"Now, speak not to me,\" said Margaret languidly; \"let me listen to the\nfountain: what are you a competitor for?\"\n\nHe told her.\n\n\"Very well! You will gain one prize, at least.\"\n\n\"Which? which? have you seen any of my work?\"\n\n\"I? no. But you will gain a prize.\n\n\"I hope so; but what makes you think so?\"\n\n\"Because you were so good to my father.\"\n\nGerard smiled at the feminine logic, and hung his head at the sweet\npraise, and was silent.\n\n\"Speak not,\" murmured Margaret. \"They say this is a world of sin and\nmisery. Can that be? What is your opinion?\"\n\n\"No! that is all a silly old song,\" explained Gerard. \"'Tis a byword our\nelders keep repeating, out of custom: it is not true.\"\n\n\"How can you know? You are but a child,\" said Margaret, with pensive\ndignity.\n\n\"Why, only look round! And then thought I had lost you for ever; and you\nare by my side; and now the minstrels are going to play again. Sin and\nmisery? Stuff and nonsense!\"\n\nThe lutes burst out. The courtyard rang again with their delicate\nharmony.\n\n\"What do you admire most of all these beautiful things, Gerard?\"\n\n\"You know my name? How is that?\"\n\n\"White magic. I am a--witch.\"\n\n\"Angels are never witches. But I can't think how you--\"\n\n\"Foolish boy! was it not cried at the gate loud enough to deave one?\"\n\n\"So it was. Where is my head? What do I admire most? If you will sit a\nlittle more that way, I'll tell you.\"\n\n\"This way?\"\n\n\"Yes; so that the light may fall on you. There! I see many fair things\nhere, fairer than I could have conceived; but the fairest of all, to\nmy eye, is your lovely hair in its silver frame, and the setting sun\nkissing it. It minds me of what the Vulgate praises for beauty, 'an\napple of gold in a network of silver,' and oh, what a pity I did not\nknow you before I sent in my poor endeavours at illuminating! I could\nilluminate so much better now. I could do everything better. There, now\nthe sun is full on it, it is like an aureole. So our Lady looked, and\nnone since her until to-day.\"\n\n\"Oh, fie! it is wicked to talk so. Compare a poor, coarse-favoured girl\nlike me with the Queen of Heaven? Oh, Gerard! I thought you were a good\nyoung man.\" And Margaret was shocked apparently.\n\nGerard tried to explain. \"I am no worse than the rest; but how can I\nhelp having eyes, and a heart Margaret!\"\n\n\"Gerard!\"\n\n\"Be not angry now!\"\n\n\"Now, is it likely?\"\n\n\"I love you.\"\n\n\"Oh, for shame! you must not say that to me,\" and Margaret coloured\nfuriously at this sudden assault.\n\n\"I can't help it. I love you. I love you.\"\n\n\"Hush, hush! for pity's sake! I must not listen to such words from a\nstranger. I am ungrateful to call you a stranger. Oh! how one may be\nmistaken! If I had known you were so bold--\" And Margaret's bosom began\nto heave, and her cheeks were covered with blushes, and she looked\ntowards her sleeping father, very much like a timid thing that meditates\nactual flight.\n\nThen Gerard was frightened at the alarm he caused. \"Forgive me,\" said he\nimploringly. \"How could any one help loving you?\"\n\n\"Well, sir, I will try and forgive you--you are so good in other\nrespects; but then you must promise me never to say you--to say that\nagain.\"\n\n\"Give me your hand then, or you don't forgive me.\"\n\nShe hesitated; but eventually put out her hand a very little way, very\nslowly, and with seeming reluctance. He took it, and held it prisoner.\nWhen she thought it had been there long enough, she tried gently to draw\nit away. He held it tight: it submitted quite patiently to force.\nWhat is the use resisting force. She turned her head away, and her long\neyelashes drooped sweetly. Gerard lost nothing by his promise. Words\nwere not needed here; and silence was more eloquent. Nature was in that\nday what she is in ours; but manners were somewhat freer. Then as now,\nvirgins drew back alarmed at the first words of love; but of prudery\nand artificial coquetry there was little, and the young soon read one\nanother's hearts. Everything was on Gerard's side, his good looks, her\nbelief in his goodness, her gratitude; and opportunity for at the Duke's\nbanquet this mellow summer eve, all things disposed the female nature\nto tenderness: the avenues to the heart lay open; the senses were so\nsoothed and subdued with lovely colours, gentle sounds, and delicate\nodours; the sun gently sinking, the warm air, the green canopy, the cool\nmusic of the now violet fountain.\n\nGerard and Margaret sat hand in hand in silence; and Gerard's eyes\nsought hers lovingly; and hers now and then turned on him timidly and\nimploringly and presently two sweet unreasonable tears rolled down her\ncheeks, and she smiled while they were drying: yet they did not take\nlong.\n\nAnd the sun declined; and the air cooled; and the fountain plashed more\ngently; and the pair throbbed in unison and silence, and this weary\nworld looked heaven to them.\n\n     Oh, the merry days, the merry days when we were young.\n     Oh, the merry days, the merry days when we were young.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nA grave white-haired seneschal came to their table, and inquired\ncourteously whether Gerard Eliassoen was of their company. Upon Gerard's\nanswer, he said:\n\n\"The Princess Marie would confer with you, young sir; I am to conduct\nyou to her presence.\"\n\nInstantly all faces within hearing turned sharp round, and were bent\nwith curiosity and envy on the man that was to go to a princess.\n\nGerard rose to obey.\n\n\"I wager we shall not see you again,\" said Margaret calmly, but\ncolouring a little.\n\n\"That you will,\" was the reply: then he whispered in her ear: \"This is\nmy good princess; but you are my queen.\" He added aloud: \"Wait for me, I\npray you, I will presently return.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay!\" said Peter, awaking and speaking at one and the same moment.\n\nGerard gone, the pair whose dress was so homely, yet they were with the\nman whom the Princess sent for, became \"the cynosure of neighbouring\neyes;\" observing which, William Johnson came forward, acted surprise,\nand claimed his relations.\n\n\"And to think that there was I at your backs, and you saw me not\"\n\n\"Nay, cousin Johnson, I saw you long syne,\" said Margaret coldly.\n\n\"You saw me, and spoke not to me?\"\n\n\"Cousin, it was for you to welcome us to Rotterdam, as it is for us\nto welcome you at Sevenbergen. Your servant denied us a seat in your\nhouse.\"\n\n\"The idiot!\"\n\n\"And I had a mind to see whether it was 'like maid like master:' for\nthere is sooth in bywords.\"\n\nWilliam Johnson blushed purple. He saw Margaret was keen, and suspected\nhim. He did the wisest thing under the circumstances, trusted to deeds\nnot words. He insisted on their coming home with him at once, and he\nwould show them whether they were welcome to Rotterdam or not.\n\n\"Who doubts it, cousin? Who doubts it?\" said the scholar.\n\nMargaret thanked him graciously, but demurred to go just now: said\nshe wanted to hear the minstrels again. In about a quarter of an hour\nJohnson renewed his proposal, and bade her observe that many of the\nguests had left. Then her real reason came out.\n\n\"It were ill manners to our friend; and he will lose us. He knows not\nwhere we lodge in Rotterdam, and the city is large, and we have parted\ncompany once already.\"\n\n\"Oh!\" said Johnson, \"we will provide for that. My young man, ahem!\nI mean my secretary, shall sit here and wait, and bring him on to my\nhouse: he shall lodge with me and with no other.\"\n\n\"Cousin, we shall be too burdensome.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay; you shall see whether you are welcome or not, you and your\nfriends, and your friends' friends, if need be; and I shall hear what\nthe Princess would with him.\"\n\nMargaret felt a thrill of joy that Gerard should be lodged under the\nsame roof with her; then she had a slight misgiving.\n\n\"But if your young man should be thoughtless, and go play, and Gerard\nmiss him?\"\n\n\"He go play? He leave that spot where I put him, and bid him stay? Ho!\nstand forth, Hans Cloterman.\"\n\nA figure clad in black serge and dark violet hose arose, and took two\nsteps and stood before them without moving a muscle: a solemn, precise\nyoung man, the very statue of gravity and starched propriety. At his\naspect Margaret, being very happy, could hardly keep her countenance.\nBut she whispered Johnson, \"I would put my hand in the fire for him. We\nare at your command, cousin, as soon as you have given him his orders.\"\n\nHans was then instructed to sit at the table and wait for Gerard, and\nconduct him to Ooster-Waagen Straet. He replied, not in words, but\nby calmly taking the seat indicated, and Margaret, Peter, and William\nJohnson went away together.\n\n\"And, indeed, it is time you were abed, father, after all your travel,\"\nsaid Margaret. This had been in her mind all along.\n\nHans Cloterman sat waiting for Gerard, solemn and businesslike. The\nminutes flew by, but excited no impatience in that perfect young man.\nJohnson did him no more than justice when he laughed to scorn the idea\nof his secretary leaving his post or neglecting his duty in pursuit of\nsport or out of youthful hilarity and frivolity.\n\nAs Gerard was long in coming, the patient Hans--his employer's eye being\nno longer on him improved the time by quaffing solemnly, silently, and\nat short but accurately measured intervals, goblets of Corsican wine.\nThe wine was strong, so was Cloterman's head; and Gerard had been gone\na good hour ere the model secretary imbibed the notion that Creation\nexpected Cloterman to drink the health of all good fellows, and\nnommement of the Duke of Burgundy there present. With this view he\nfilled bumper nine, and rose gingerly but solemnly and slowly. Having\nreached his full height, he instantly rolled upon the grass, goblet\nin hand, spilling the cold liquor on more than one ankle--whose owners\nfrisked--but not disturbing a muscle in his own long face, which, in\nthe total eclipse of reason, retained its gravity, primness, and\ninfallibility.\n\nThe seneschal led Gerard through several passages to the door of the\npavilion, where some young noblemen, embroidered and feathered, sat\nsentinel, guarding the heir-apparent, and playing cards by the red light\nof torches their servants held. A whisper from the seneschal, and one\nof them rose reluctantly, stared at Gerard with haughty surprise, and\nentered the pavilion. He presently returned, and, beckoning the pair,\nled then, through a passage or two and landed them in an ante-chamber,\nwhere sat three more young gentlemen, feathered, furred, and embroidered\nlike pieces of fancy work, and deep in that instructive and edifying\nbranch of learning, dice.\n\n\"You can't see the Princess--it is too late,\" said one.\n\nAnother followed suit:\n\n\"She passed this way but now with her nurse. She is gone to bed, doll\nand all. Deuce--ace again!\"\n\nGerard prepared to retire. The seneschal, with an incredulous smile,\nreplied:\n\n\"The young man is here by the Countess's orders; be so good as conduct\nhim to her ladies.\"\n\nOn this a superb Adonis rose, with an injured look, and led Gerard into\na room where sat or lolloped eleven ladies, chattering like magpies.\nTwo, more industrious than the rest, were playing cat's-cradle with\nfingers as nimble as their tongues. At the sight of a stranger all the\ntongues stopped like one piece of complicated machinery, and all the\neyes turned on Gerard, as if the same string that checked the tongues\nhad turned the eyes on. Gerard was ill at ease before, but this battery\nof eyes discountenanced him, and down went his eyes on the ground. Then\nthe cowards finding, like the hare who ran by the pond and the frogs\nscuttled into the water, that there was a creature they could frighten,\ngiggled and enjoyed their prowess. Then a duenna said severely,\n\"Mesdames!\" and they were all abashed at once as though a modesty string\nhad been pulled. This same duenna took Gerard, and marched before him\nin solemn silence. The young man's heart sank, and he had half a mind to\nturn and run out of the place.\n\n\"What must princes be,\" he thought, \"when their courtiers are so\nfreezing? Doubtless they take their breeding from him they serve.\" These\nreflections were interrupted by the duenna suddenly introducing him into\na room where three ladies sat working, and a pretty little girl tuning\na lute. The ladies were richly but not showily dressed, and the duenna\nwent up to the one who was hemming a kerchief, and said a few words in\na low tone. This lady then turned towards Gerard with a smile, and\nbeckoned him to come near her. She did not rise, but she laid aside her\nwork, and her manner of turning towards him, slight as the movement was,\nwas full of grace and ease and courtesy. She began a conversation at\nonce.\n\n\"Margaret Van Eyck is an old friend of mine, sir, and I am right glad to\nhave a letter from her hand, and thankful to you, sir, for bringing it\nto me safely. Marie, my love, this is the gentleman who brought you that\npretty miniature.\"\n\n\"Sir, I thank you a thousand times,\" said the young lady.\n\n\"I am glad you feel her debtor, sweetheart, for our friend would have us\nto do him a little service in return.\n\n\"I will do anything on earth for him,\" replied the young lady with\nardour.\n\n\"Anything on earth is nothing in the world,\" said the Countess of\nCharolois quietly.\n\n\"Well, then, I will--What would you have me to do, sir?\"\n\nGerard had just found out what high society he was in. \"My sovereign\ndemoiselle,\" said he, gently and a little tremulously, \"where there have\nbeen no pains, there needs no reward.\"\n\nBut we must obey mamma. All the world must obey\n\n\"That is true. Then, our demoiselle, reward me, if you will by letting\nme hear the stave you were going to sing and I did interrupt it.\"\n\n\"What! you love music, sir?\"\n\n\"I adore it.\"\n\nThe little princess looked inquiringly at her mother, and received a\nsmile of assent. She then took her lute and sang a romaunt of the day.\nAlthough but twelve years old, she was a well-taught and painstaking\nmusician. Her little claw swept the chords with Courage and precision,\nand struck out the notes of the arpeggio clear, and distinct, and\nbright, like twinkling stars; but the main charm was her voice. It was\nnot mighty, but it was round, clear, full, and ringing like a bell. She\nsang with a certain modest eloquence, though she knew none of the tricks\nof feeling. She was too young to be theatrical, or even sentimental,\nso nothing was forced--all gushed. Her little mouth seemed the mouth of\nNature. The ditty, too, was as pure as its utterance. As there were none\nof those false divisions--those whining slurs, which are now sold so\ndear by Italian songsters, though every jackal in India delivers them\ngratis to his customers all night, and sometimes gets shot for them, and\nalways deserves it--so there were no cadences and fiorituri, the trite,\nturgid, and feeble expletives of song, the skim-milk with which mindless\nmusicians and mindless writers quench fire, wash out colour, and drown\nmelody and meaning dead.\n\nWhile the pure and tender strain was flowing from the pure young throat,\nGerard's eyes filled. The Countess watched him with interest, for it\nwas usual to applaud the Princess loudly, but not with cheek and eye.\nSo when the voice ceased, and the glasses left off ringing, she asked\ndemurely, \"Was he content?\"\n\nGerard gave a little start; the spoken voice broke a charm and brought\nhim back to earth.\n\n\"Oh, madam!\" he cried, \"surely it is thus that cherubs and seraphs sing,\nand charm the saints in heaven.\"\n\n\"I am somewhat of your opinion, my young friend,\" said the Countess,\nwith emotion; and she bent a look of love and gentle pride upon her\ngirl: a heavenly look, such as, they say, is given to the eye of the\nshort-lived resting on the short-lived.\n\nThe Countess resumed: \"My old friend request me to be serviceable to\nyou. It is the first favour she has done us the honour of asking us, and\nthe request is sacred. You are in holy orders, sir?\"\n\nGerard bowed.\n\n\"I fear you are not a priest, you look too young.\"\n\n\"Oh no, madam; I am not even a sub-deacon. I am only a lector; but next\nmonth I shall be an exorcist, and before long an acolyth.\"\n\n\"Well, Monsieur Gerard, with your accomplishments you can soon pass\nthrough the inferior orders. And let me beg you to do so. For the\nday after you have said your first mass I shall have the pleasure of\nappointing you to a benefice.\"\n\n\"Oh, madam!\"\n\n\"And, Marie, remember I make this promise in your name as well as my\nown.\"\n\n\"Fear not, mamma: I will not forget. But if he will take my advice,\nwhat he will be is Bishop of Liege. The Bishop of Liege is a beautiful\nbishop. What! do you not remember him, mamma, that day we were at Liege?\nhe was braver than grandpapa himself. He had on a crown, a high one, and\nit was cut in the middle, and it was full of oh! such beautiful jewels;\nand his gown stiff with gold; and his mantle, too; and it had a broad\nborder, all pictures; but, above all, his gloves; you have no such\ngloves, mamma. They were embroidered and covered with jewels, and\nscented with such lovely scent; I smelt them all the time he was giving\nme his blessing on my head with them. Dear old man! I dare say he will\ndie soon most old people do and then, sir, you Can be bishop you know,\nand wear--\n\n\"Gently, Marie, gently: bishoprics are for old gentlemen; and this is a\nyoung gentleman.\"\n\n\"Mamma! he is not so very young.\n\n\"Not compared with you, Marie, eh?\"\n\n\"He is a good birth dear mamma; and I am sure he is good enough for a\nbishop.\n\n\"Alas! mademoiselle, you are mistaken\"\n\n\"I know not that, Monsieur Gerard; but I am a little puzzled to know on\nwhat grounds mademoiselle there pronounces your character so boldly.\"\n\n\"Alas! mamma,\" said the Princess, \"you have not looked at his face,\nthen;\" and she raised her eyebrows at her mother's simplicity.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said the Countess, \"I have. Well, sir, if I cannot\ngo quite so fast as my daughter, attribute it to my age, not to a want\nof interest in your welfare. A benefice will do to begin your Career\nwith; and I must take care it is not too far from--what call you the\nplace?\"\n\n\"Tergou, madam\n\n\"A priest gives up much,\" continued the Countess; \"often, I fear, he\nlearns too late how much;\" and her woman's eye rested a moment on Gerard\nwith mild pity and half surprise at his resigning her sex and all the\nheaven they can bestow, and the great parental joys: \"at least you shall\nbe near your friends. Have you a mother?\"\n\n\"Yes, madam, thanks be to God!\"\n\n\"Good! You shall have a church near Tergou. She will thank me. And now,\nsir, we must not detain you too long from those who have a better claim\non your society than we have. Duchess, oblige me by bidding one of the\npages conduct him to the hall of banquet; the way is hard to find.\"\n\nGerard bowed low to the Countess and the Princess, and backed towards\nthe door.\n\n\"I hope it will be a nice benefice,\" said the Princess to him, with a\npretty smile, as he was going out; then, shaking her head with an air of\nsolemn misgiving, \"but you had better have been Bishop of Liege.\"\n\nGerard followed his new conductor, his heart warm with gratitude; but\nere he reached the banquet-hall a chill came over him. The mind of one\nwho has led a quiet, uneventful life is not apt to take in contradictory\nfeelings at the same moment and balance them, but rather to be\noverpowered by each in turn. While Gerard was with the Countess, the\nexcitement of so new a situation, the unlooked-for promise the joy\nand pride it would cause at home, possessed him wholly; but now it was\npassion's turn to be heard again. What! give up Margaret, whose soft\nhand he still felt in his, and her deep eyes in his heart? resign her\nand all the world of love and joy she had opened on him to-day? The\nrevulsion, when it did come, was so strong that he hastily resolved\nto say nothing at home about the offered benefice. \"The Countess is\nso good,\" thought he, \"she has a hundred ways of aiding a young man's\nfortune: she will not compel me to be a priest when she shall learn I\nlove one of her sex: one would almost think she does know it, for she\ncast a strange look on me, and said, 'A priest gives up much, too much.'\nI dare say she will give me a place about the palace.\" And with this\nhopeful reflection his mind was eased, and, being now at the entrance\nof the banqueting hall, he thanked his conductor, and ran hastily with\njoyful eyes to Margaret. He came in sight of the table--she was gone.\nPeter was gone too. Nobody was at the table at all; only a citizen in\nsober garments had just tumbled under it dead drunk, and several persons\nwere raising him to carry him away. Gerard never guessed how important\nthis solemn drunkard was to him: he was looking for \"Beauty,\" and\nlet the \"Beast\" lie. He ran wildly round the hall, which was now\ncomparatively empty. She was not there. He left the palace: outside he\nfound a crowd gaping at two great fan-lights just lighted over the gate.\nHe asked them earnestly if they had seen an old man in a gown, and a\nlovely girl pass out. They laughed at the question. \"They were staring\nat these new lights that turn night into day. They didn't trouble their\nheads about old men and young wenches, every-day sights.\" From another\ngroup he learned there was a Mystery being played under canvas hard by,\nand all the world gone to see it. This revived his hopes, and he went\nand saw the Mystery.\n\nIn this representation divine personages, too sacred for me to name\nhere, came clumsily down from heaven to talk sophistry with the cardinal\nVirtues, the nine Muses, and the seven deadly sins, all present in\nhuman shape, and not unlike one another. To enliven which weary stuff\nin rattled the Prince of the power of the air, and an imp that kept\nmolesting him and buffeting him with a bladder, at each thwack of which\nthe crowd were in ecstasies. When the Vices had uttered good store of\nobscenity and the Virtues twaddle, the celestials, including the nine\nMuses went gingerly back to heaven one by one; for there was but one\ncloud; and two artisans worked it up with its supernatural freight,\nand worked it down with a winch, in full sight of the audience. These\ndisposed of, the bottomless pit opened and flamed in the centre of the\nstage; the carpenters and Virtues shoved the Vices in, and the Virtues\nand Beelzebub and his tormentor danced merrily round the place of\neternal torture to the fife and tabor.\n\nThis entertainment was writ by the Bishop of Ghent for the diffusion\nof religious sentiment by the aid of the senses, and was an average\nspecimen of theatrical exhibitions so long as they were in the hands of\nthe clergy. But, in course of time, the laity conducted plays, and so\nthe theatre, I learn from the pulpit, has become profane.\n\nMargaret was nowhere in the crowd, and Gerard could not enjoy the\nperformance; he actually went away in Act 2, in the midst of a\nmuch-admired piece of dialogue, in which Justice out-quibbled Satan. He\nwalked through many streets, but could not find her he sought. At last,\nfairly worn out, he went to a hostelry and slept till daybreak. All that\nday, heavy and heartsick, he sought her, but could never fall in with\nher or her father, nor ever obtain the slightest clue. Then he felt she\nwas false or had changed her mind. He was irritated now, as well as sad.\nMore good fortune fell on him; he almost hated it. At last, on the third\nday, after he had once more been through every street, he said, \"She is\nnot in the town, and I shall never see her again. I will go home.\"\nHe started for Tergou with royal favour promised, with fifteen golden\nangels in his purse, a golden medal on his bosom, and a heart like a\nlump of lead.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nIt was near four o'clock in the afternoon. Eli was in the shop. His\neldest and youngest sons were abroad. Catherine and her little crippled\ndaughter had long been anxious about Gerard, and now they were gone a\nlittle way down the road, to see if by good luck he might be visible\nin the distance; and Giles was alone in the sitting-room, which I will\nsketch, furniture and dwarf included.\n\nThe Hollanders were always an original and leading people. They claim\nto have invented printing (wooden type), oil-painting, liberty,\nbanking, gardening, etc. Above all, years before my tale, they invented\ncleanliness. So, while the English gentry, in velvet jerkins and\nchicken-toed shoes, trode floors of stale rushes, foul receptacle of\nbones, decomposing morsels, spittle, dogs, eggs, and all abominations,\nthis hosier's sitting-room at Tergou was floored with Dutch tiles, so\nhighly glazed and constantly washed, that you could eat off them. There\nwas one large window; the cross stone-work in the centre of it was\nvery massive, and stood in relief, looking like an actual cross to the\ninmates, and was eyed as such in their devotions. The panes were very\nsmall and lozenge-shaped, and soldered to one another with strips of\nlead: the like you may see to this day in our rural cottages. The chairs\nwere rude and primitive, all but the arm-chair, whose back, at right\nangles with its seat, was so high that the sitter's head stopped two\nfeet short of the top. This chair was of oak, and carved at the summit.\nThere was a copper pail, that went in at the waist, holding holy water,\nand a little hand-besom to sprinkle it far and wide; and a long, narrow,\nbut massive oak table, and a dwarf sticking to its rim by his teeth, his\neyes glaring, and his claws in the air like a pouncing vampire. Nature,\nit would seem, did not make Giles a dwarf out of malice prepense; she\nconstructed a head and torso with her usual care; but just then her\nattention was distracted, and she left the rest to chance; the result\nwas a human wedge, an inverted cone. He might justly have taken her to\ntask in the terms of Horace,\n\n     \"Amphora coepit\n     Institui; currente rota cur urceus exit?\"\n\nHis centre was anything but his centre of gravity. Bisected, upper Giles\nwould have outweighed three lower Giles. But this very disproportion\nenabled him to do feats that would have baffled Milo. His brawny arms\nhad no weight to draw after them; so he could go up a vertical pole like\na squirrel, and hang for hours from a bough by one hand like a cherry by\nits stalk. If he could have made a vacuum with his hands, as the lizard\nis said to do with its feet, he would have gone along a ceiling. Now,\nthis pocket-athlete was insanely fond of gripping the dinner-table with\nboth hands, and so swinging; and then--climax of delight! he would seize\nit with his teeth, and, taking off his hands, hold on like grim death by\nhis huge ivories.\n\nBut all our joys, however elevating, suffer interruption. Little Kate\ncaught Sampsonet in this posture, and stood aghast. She was her mother's\ndaughter, and her heart was with the furniture, not with the 12mo\ngymnast.\n\n\"Oh, Giles! how can you? Mother is at hand. It dents the table.\"\n\n\"Go and tell her, little tale-bearer,\" snarled Giles. \"You are the one\nfor making mischief.\"\n\n\"Am I?\" inquired Kate calmly; \"that is news to me.\"\n\n\"The biggest in Tergou,\" growled Giles, fastening on again.\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said Kate drily.\n\nThis piece of unwonted satire launched, and Giles not visibly blasted,\nshe sat down quietly and cried.\n\nHer mother came in almost at that moment, and Giles hurled himself under\nthe table, and there glared.\n\n\"What is to do now?\" said the dame sharply. Then turning her experienced\neyes from Kate to Giles, and observing the position he had taken up, and\na sheepish expression, she hinted at cuffing of ears.\n\n\"Nay, mother,\" said the girl; \"it was but a foolish word Giles spoke.\nI had not noticed it at another time; but I was tired and in care for\nGerard, you know.\"\n\n\"Let no one be in care for me,\" said a faint voice at the door, and in\ntottered Gerard, pale, dusty, and worn out; and amidst uplifted hands\nand cries of delight, curiosity, and anxiety mingled, dropped exhausted\ninto the nearest chair.\n\nBeating Rotterdam, like a covert, for Margaret, and the long journey\nafterwards, had fairly knocked Gerard up. But elastic youth soon\nrevived, and behold him the centre of an eager circle. First of all they\nmust hear about the prizes. Then Gerard told them he had been admitted\nto see the competitors' works, all laid out in an enormous hall before\nthe judges pronounced.\n\n\"Oh, mother! oh, Kate! when I saw the goldsmiths' work, I had liked to\nhave fallen on the floor. I thought not all the goldsmiths on earth had\nso much gold, silver, jewels, and craft of design and facture. But, in\nsooth, all the arts are divine.\"\n\nThen, to please the females, he described to them the reliquaries,\nferetories, calices, crosiers, crosses, pyxes, monstrances, and other\nwonders ecclesiastical, and the goblets, hanaps, watches, Clocks,\nchains, brooches, &c., so that their mouths watered.\n\n\"But, Kate, when I came to the illuminated work from Ghent and Bruges,\nmy heart sank. Mine was dirt by the side of it. For the first minute I\ncould almost have cried; but I prayed for a better spirit, and presently\nI was able to enjoy them, and thank God for those lovely works, and\nfor those skilful, patient craftsmen, whom I own my masters. Well, the\ncoloured work was so beautiful I forgot all about the black and white.\nBut next day, when all the other prizes had been given, they came to the\nwriting, and whose name think you was called first?\"\n\n\"Yours,\" said Kate.\n\nThe others laughed her to scorn.\n\n\"You may well laugh,\" said Gerard, \"but for all that, Gerard Eliassoen\nof Tergou was the name the herald shouted. I stood stupid; they thrust\nme forward. Everything swam before my eyes. I found myself kneeling on\na cushion at the feet of the Duke. He said something to me, but I was so\nfluttered I could not answer him. So then he put his hand to his side,\nand did not draw a glaive and cut off my dull head, but gave me a gold\nmedal, and there it is.\" There was a yell and almost a scramble. \"And\nthen he gave me fifteen great bright golden angels. I had seen one\nbefore, but I never handled one. Here they are.\"\n\n\"Oh, Gerard! oh, Gerard!\"\n\n\"There is one for you, our eldest; and one for you, Sybrandt, and for\nyou, Little Mischief; and two for thee, Little Lily, because God hath\nafflicted thee; and one for myself, to buy colours and vellum; and nine\nfor her that nursed us all, and risked the two crowns upon poor Gerard's\nhand.\"\n\nThe gold drew out their characters. Cornelis and Sybrandt clutched each\nhis coin with one glare of greediness and another glare of envy at Kate,\nwho had got two pieces. Giles seized his and rolled it along the floor\nand gambolled after it. Kate put down her crutches and sat down, and\nheld out her little arms to Gerard with a heavenly gesture of love and\ntenderness; and the mother, fairly benumbed at first by the shower of\ngold that fell on her apron, now cried out, \"Leave kissing him, Kate;\nhe is my son, not yours. Ah. Gerard! my boy! I have not loved you as you\ndeserved.\"\n\nThen Gerard threw himself on his knees beside her, and she flung her\narms round him and wept for joy and pride upon his neck.\n\n\"Good lad! good lad!\" cried the hosier, with some emotion. \"I must go\nand tell the neighbours. Lend me the medal, Gerard; I'll show it my good\nfriend Peter Buyskens; he is ever regaling me with how his son Jorian\nwon the tin mug a shooting at the butts.\"\n\n\"Ay, do, my man; and show Peter Buyskens one of the angels. Tell him\nthere are fourteen more where that came from. Mind you bring it me\nback!\"\n\n\"Stay a minute, father; there is better news behind,\" said Gerard,\nflushing with joy at the joy he caused.\n\n\"Better! better than this?\"\n\nThen Gerard told his interview with the Countess, and the house rang\nwith joy.\n\n\"Now, God bless the good lady, and bless the dame Van Eyck! A benefice?\nour son! My cares are at an end. Eli, my good friend and master, now we\ntwo can die happy whenever our time comes. This dear boy will take our\nplace, and none of these loved ones will want a home or a friend.\"\n\nFrom that hour Gerard was looked upon as the stay of the family. He\nwas a son apart, but in another sense. He was always in the right, and\nnothing too good for him. Cornelis and Sybrandt became more and more\njealous of him, and longed for the day he should go to his benefice;\nthey would get rid of the favourite, and his reverence's purse would be\nopen to them. With these views he co-operated. The wound love had\ngiven him throbbed duller and duller. His success and the affection and\nadmiration of his parents made him think more highly of himself, and\nresent with more spirit Margaret's ingratitude and discourtesy. For all\nthat, she had power to cool him towards the rest of her sex, and now for\nevery reason he wished to be ordained priest as soon as he could pass\nthe intermediate orders. He knew the Vulgate already better than most of\nthe clergy, and studied the rubric and the dogmas of the Church with\nhis friends the monks; and, the first time the bishop came that way, he\napplied to be admitted \"exorcist,\" the third step in holy orders. The\nbishop questioned him, and ordained him at once. He had to kneel, and,\nafter a short prayer, the bishop delivered to him a little MS. full of\nexorcisms, and said: \"Take this, Gerard, and have power to lay hands\non the possessed, whether baptized or catechumens!\" and he took it\nreverently, and went home invested by the Church with power to cast out\ndemons.\n\nReturning home from the church, he was met by little Kate on her\ncrutches.\n\n\"Oh, Gerard! who, think you, hath sent to our house seeking you?--the\nburgomaster himself.\"\n\n\"Ghysbrecht Van Swieten! What would he with me?\"\n\n\"Nay, Gerard, I know not. But he seems urgent to see you. You are to go\nto his house on the instant.\"\n\n\"Well, he is the burgomaster: I will go; but it likes me not. Kate, I\nhave seen him cast such a look on me as no friend casts. No matter; such\nlooks forewarn the wise. To be sure, he knows.\"\n\n\"Knows what, Gerard?\"\n\n\"Nothing.\"\n\n\"Nothing?\"\n\n\"Kate, I'll go.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nGhysbrecht Van Swieten was an artful man. He opened on the novice with\nsomething quite wide of the mark he was really aiming at. \"The town\nrecords,\" said he, \"are crabbedly written, and the ink rusty with age.\"\nHe offered Gerard the honour of transcribing them fair.\n\nGerard inquired what he was to be paid.\n\nGhysbrecht offered a sum that would have just purchased the pens, ink,\nand parchment.\n\n\"But, burgomaster, my labour? Here is a year's work.\"\n\n\"Your labour? Call you marking parchment labour? Little sweat goes to\nthat, I trow.\"\n\n\"'Tis labour, and skilled labour to boot; and that is better paid in all\ncrafts than rude labour, sweat or no sweat. Besides, there's my time.\"\n\n\"Your time? Why, what is time to you, at two-and-twenty?\" Then fixing\nhis eyes keenly on Gerard, to mark the effect of his words, he said:\n\"Say, rather, you are idle grown. You are in love. Your body is with\nthese chanting monks, but your heart is with Peter Brandt and his\nred-haired girl.\"\n\n\"I know no Peter Brandt.\"\n\nThis denial confirmed Ghysbrecht's suspicion that the caster-out of\ndemons was playing a deep game.\n\n\"Ye lie!\" he shouted. \"Did I not find you at her elbow on the road to\nRotterdam?\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"Ah! And you were seen at Sevenbergen but t'other day.\"\n\n\"Was I?'\n\n\"Ah and at Peter's house.\"\n\n\"At Sevenbergen?\"\n\n\"Ay, at Sevenbergen.\"\n\nNow, this was what in modern days is called a draw. It was a guess, put\nboldly forth as fact, to elicit by the young man's answer whether he had\nbeen there lately or not.\n\nThe result of the artifice surprised the crafty one. Gerard started up\nin a strange state of nervous excitement.\n\n\"Burgomaster,\" said he, with trembling voice, \"I have not been at\nSevenbergen these three years, and I know not the name of those you saw\nme with, nor where they dwelt; but, as my time is precious, though\nyou value it not, give you good day.\" And he darted out, with his eyes\nsparkling.\n\nGhysbrecht started up in huge ire; but he sank into his chair again.\n\n\"He fears me not. He knows something, if not all.\"\n\nThen he called hastily to his trusty servant, and almost dragged him to\na window.\n\n\"See you yon man?\" he cried. \"Haste! follow him! But let him not see\nyou. He is young, but old in craft. Keep him in sight all day. Let me\nknow whither he goes, and what he does.\"\n\nIt was night when the servant returned.\n\n\"Well? well?\" cried Van Swieten eagerly.\n\n\"Master, the young man went from you to Sevenbergen.\"\n\nGhysbrecht groaned.\n\n\"To the house of Peter the Magician.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\n\"Look into your own heart and write!\" said Herr Cant; and earth's\ncuckoos echoed the cry. Look into the Rhine where it is deepest, and the\nThames where it is thickest, and paint the bottom. Lower a bucket into\na well of self-deception, and what comes up must be immortal truth,\nmustn't it? Now, in the first place, no son of Adam ever reads his own\nheart at all, except by the habit acquired, and the light gained, from\nsome years perusal of other hearts; and even then, with his acquired\nsagacity and reflected light, he can but spell and decipher his own\nheart, not read it fluently. Half way to Sevenbergen Gerard looked into\nhis own heart, and asked it why he was going to Sevenbergen. His heart\nreplied without a moment's hesitation, \"We are going out of curiosity\nto know why she jilted us, and to show her it has not broken our hearts,\nand that we are quite content with our honours and our benefice in\nprospectu, and don't want her nor ally of her fickle sex.\"\n\nHe soon found out Peter Brandt's cottage; and there sat a girl in the\ndoorway, plying her needle, and a stalwart figure leaned on a long bow\nand talked to her. Gerard felt an unaccountable pang at the sight of\nhim. However, the man turned out to be past fifty years of age, an old\nsoldier, whom Gerard remembered to have seen shoot at the butts with\nadmirable force and skill. Another minute and the youth stood before\nthem. Margaret looked up and dropped her work, and uttered a faint cry,\nand was white and red by turns. But these signs of emotion were swiftly\ndismissed, and she turned far more chill and indifferent than she would\nif she had not betrayed this agitation.\n\n\"What! is it you, Master Gerard? What on earth brings you here, I\nwonder?\"\n\n\"I was passing by and saw you; so I thought I would give you good day,\nand ask after your father.\"\n\n\"My father is well. He will be here anon.\"\n\n\"Then I may as well stay till he comes.\"\n\n\"As you will. Good Martin, step into the village and tell my father here\nis a friend of his.\"\n\n\"And not of yours?\"\n\n\"My father's friends are mine.\"\n\n\"That is doubtful. It was not like a friend to promise to wait for me,\nand then make off the moment my back was turned. Cruel Margaret you\nlittle know how I searched the town for you; how for want of you nothing\nwas pleasant to me.\"\n\n\"These are idle words; if you had desired my father's company, or mine,\nyou would have come back. There I had a bed laid for you, sir, at my\ncousin's, and he would have made much of you, and, who knows, I might\nhave made much of you too. I was in the humour that day. You will\nnot catch me in the same mind again, neither you nor any young man, I\nwarrant me.\"\n\n\"Margaret, I came back the moment the Countess let me go; but you were\nnot there.\"\n\n\"Nay, you did not, or you had seen Hans Cloterman at our table; we left\nhim to bring you on.\"\n\n\"I saw no one there, but only a drunken man, that had just tumbled\ndown.\"\n\n\"At our table? How was he clad?\"\n\n\"Nay, I took little heed: in sad-coloured garb.\"\n\nAt this Margaret's face gradually warmed; but presently, assuming\nincredulity and severity, she put many shrewd questions, all of which\nGerard answered most loyally. Finally, the clouds cleared, and they\nguessed how the misunderstanding had come about. Then came a revulsion\nof tenderness, all the more powerful that they had done each other\nwrong; and then, more dangerous still, came mutual confessions. Neither\nhad been happy since; neither ever would have been happy but for this\nfortunate meeting.\n\nAnd Gerard found a MS. Vulgate lying open on the table, and pounced upon\nit like a hawk. MSS. were his delight; but before he could get to it two\nwhite hands quickly came flat upon the page, and a red face over them.\n\n\"Nay, take away your hands, Margaret, that I may see where you are\nreading, and I will read there too at home; so shall my soul meet yours\nin the sacred page. You will not? Nay, then I must kiss them away.\" And\nhe kissed them so often, that for very shame they were fain to withdraw,\nand, lo! the sacred book lay open at,\n\n\"An apple of gold in a network of silver.\"\n\n\"There, now,\" said she, \"I had been hunting for it ever so long,\nand found it but even now--and to be caught!\" and with a touch of\ninconsistency she pointed it out to Gerard with her white finger.\n\n\"Ay,\" said he, \"but to-day it is all hidden in that great cap.\"\n\n\"It is a comely cap, I'm told by some.\"\n\n\"Maybe; but what it hides is beautiful.\"\n\n\"It is not: it is hideous.\"\n\n\"Well, it was beautiful at Rotterdam.\"\n\n\"Ay, everything was beautiful that day\" (with a little sigh).\n\nAnd now Peter came in, and welcomed Gerard cordially, and would have him\nto stay supper. And Margaret disappeared; and Gerard had a nice learned\nchat with Peter; and Margaret reappeared with her hair in her silver\nnet, and shot a glance half arch, half coy, and glided about them, and\nspread supper, and beamed bright with gaiety and happiness. And in\nthe cool evening Gerard coaxed her out, and she objected and came; and\ncoaxed her on to the road to Tergou, and she declined, and came; and\nthere they strolled up and down, hand in hand; and when he must go, they\npledged each other never to quarrel or misunderstand one another again;\nand they sealed the promise with a long loving kiss, and Gerard went\nhome on wings.\n\nFrom that day Gerard spent most of his evenings with Margaret, and the\nattachment deepened and deepened on both sides, till the hours they\nspent together were the hours they lived; the rest they counted and\nunderwent. And at the outset of this deep attachment all went smoothly.\nObstacles there were, but they seemed distant and small to the eyes of\nhope, youth, and love. The feelings and passions of so many persons,\nthat this attachment would thwart, gave no warning smoke to show\ntheir volcanic nature and power. The course of true love ran smoothly,\nplacidly, until it had drawn these two young hearts into its current for\never.\n\nAnd then--\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nOne bright morning unwonted velvet shone, unwonted feathers waved, and\nhorses' hoofs glinted and ran through the streets of Tergou, and the\nwindows and balconies were studded with wondering faces. The French\nambassador was riding through to sport in the neighbouring forest.\n\nBesides his own suite, he was attended by several servants of the Duke\nof Burgundy, lent to do him honour and minister to his pleasure. The\nDuke's tumbler rode before him with a grave, sedate majesty, that made\nhis more noble companions seem light, frivolous persons. But ever and\nanon, when respect and awe neared the oppressive, he rolled off his\nhorse so ignobly and funnily, that even the ambassador was fain' to\nburst out laughing. He also climbed up again by the tail in a way\nprovocative of mirth, and so he played his part. Towards the rear of the\npageant rode one that excited more attention still--the Duke's leopard.\nA huntsman, mounted on a Flemish horse of giant prodigious size and\npower, carried a long box fastened to the rider's loins by straps\ncuriously contrived, and on this box sat a bright leopard crouching.\nShe was chained to the huntsman. The people admired her glossy hide\nand spots, and pressed near, and one or two were for feeling her,\nand pulling her tail; then the huntsman shouted in a terrible voice,\n\"Beware! At Antwerp one did but throw a handful of dust at her, and the\nDuke made dust of him.\"\n\n\"Gramercy!\"\n\n\"I speak sooth. The good Duke shut him up in prison, in a cell under\nground, and the rats cleaned the flesh off his bones in a night. Served\nhim right for molesting the poor thing.\"\n\nThere was a murmur of fear, and the Tergovians shrank from tickling the\nleopard of their sovereign.\n\nBut an incident followed that raised their spirits again. The Duke's\ngiant, a Hungarian seven feet four inches high, brought up the rear.\nThis enormous creature had, like some other giants, a treble, fluty\nvoice of little power. He was a vain fellow, and not conscious of this\nnor any defect. Now it happened he caught sight of Giles sitting on the\ntop of the balcony; so he stopped and began to make fun of him.\n\n\"Hallo! brother!\" squeaked he, \"I had nearly passed without seeing\nthee.\"\n\n\"You are plain enough to see,\" bellowed Giles in his bass tones.\n\n\"Come on my shoulder, brother,\" squeaked Titan, and held out a shoulder\nof mutton fist to help him down.\n\n\"If I do I'll cuff your ears,\" roared the dwarf.\n\nThe giant saw the homuncule was irascible, and played upon him, being\nencouraged thereto by the shouts of laughter. For he did not see\nthat the people were laughing not at his wit, but at the ridiculous\nincongruity of the two voices--the gigantic feeble fife, and the petty\ndeep, loud drum, the mountain delivered of a squeak, and the mole-hill\nbelching thunder.\n\nThe singular duet came to as singular an end. Giles lost all patience\nand self-command, and being a creature devoid of fear, and in a rage to\nboot, he actually dropped upon the giant's neck, seized his hair with\none hand, and punched his head with the other. The giant's first impulse\nwas to laugh, but the weight and rapidity of the blows soon corrected\nthat inclination.\n\n\"He! he! Ah! ha! hallo! oh! oh! Holy saints! here! help! or I must\nthrottle the imp. I can't! I'll split your skull against the--\" and he\nmade a wild run backwards at the balcony. Giles saw his danger, seized\nthe balcony in time with both hands, and whipped over it just as the\ngiant's head came against it with a stunning crack. The people roared\nwith laughter and exultation at the address of their little champion.\nThe indignant giant seized two of the laughers, knocked them together\nlike dumb-bells, shook them and strewed them flat--Catherine shrieked\nand threw her apron over Giles--then strode wrathfully away after the\nparty. This incident had consequences no one then present foresaw. Its\nimmediate results were agreeable. The Tergovians turned proud of Giles,\nand listened with more affability to his prayers for parchment. For\nhe drove a regular trade with his brother Gerard in this article. Went\nabout and begged it gratis, and Gerard gave him coppers for it.\n\nOn the afternoon of the same day, Catherine and her daughter were\nchatting together about their favourite theme, Gerard, his goodness, his\nbenefice, and the brightened prospects of the whole family.\n\nTheir good luck had come to them in the very shape they would have\nchosen; besides the advantages of a benefice such as the Countess\nCharolois would not disdain to give, there was the feminine delight\nat having a priest, a holy man, in their own family. \"He will marry\nCornelis and Sybrandt: for they can wed (good housewives), now, if they\nwill. Gerard will take care of you and Giles, when we are gone.\"\n\n\"Yes, mother, and we can confess to him instead of to a stranger,\" said\nKate.\n\n\"Ay, girl! and he can give the sacred oil to your father and me, and\nclose our eyes when our time comes.\"\n\n\"Oh, mother! not for many, many years, I do pray Heaven. Pray speak not\nof that, it always makes me sad. I hope to go before you, mother dear.\nNo; let us be gay to-day. I am out of pain, mother, quite out of\nall pain; it does seem so strange; and I feel so bright and happy,\nthat--mother, Can you keep a secret?\"\n\n\"Nobody better, child. Why, you know I can.\"\n\n\"Then I will show you something so beautiful. You never saw the like, I\ntrow. Only Gerard must never know; for sure he means to surprise us with\nit; he covers it up so, and sometimes he carries it away altogether.\"\n\nKate took her crutches, and moved slowly away, leaving her mother in an\nexalted state of curiosity. She soon returned with something in a cloth,\nuncovered it, and there was a lovely picture of the Virgin, with all her\ninsignia, and wearing her tiara over a wealth of beautiful hair, which\nflowed loose over her shoulders. Catherine, at first, was struck with\nawe.\n\n\"It is herself,\" she cried; \"it is the Queen of Heaven. I never saw one\nlike her to my mind before.\"\n\n\"And her eyes, mother: lifted to the sky, as if they belonged there, and\nnot to a mortal creature. And her beautiful hair of burning gold.\"\n\n\"And to think I have a son that can make the saints live again upon a\npiece of wood!\"\n\n\"The reason is, he is a young saint himself, mother. He is too good for\nthis world; he is here to portray the blessed, and then to go away and\nbe with them for ever.\"\n\nEre they had half done admiring it, a strange voice was heard at the\ndoor. By one of the furtive instincts of their sex they hastily hid the\npicture in the cloth, though there was no need, And the next moment in\ncame, casting his eyes furtively around, a man that had not entered the\nhouse this ten years Ghysbrecht Van Swieten.\n\nThe two women were so taken by surprise, that they merely stared at\nhim and at one another, and said, \"The burgomaster!\" in a tone so\nexpressive, that Ghysbrecht felt compelled to answer it.\n\n\"Yes! I own the last time I came here was not on a friendly errand. Men\nlove their own interest--Eli's and mine were contrary. Well, let this\nvisit atone the last. To-day I come on your business and none of mine.\"\nCatherine and her daughter exchanged a swift glance of contemptuous\nincredulity. They knew the man better than he thought.\n\n\"It is about your son Gerard.\"\n\n\"Ay! ay! you want him to work for the town all for nothing. He told us.\"\n\n\"I come on no such errand. It is to let you know he has fallen into bad\nhands.\"\n\n\"Now Heaven and the saints forbid! Man, torture not a mother! Speak out,\nand quickly: speak ere you have time to coin falsehood: we know thee.\"\n\nGhysbrecht turned pale at this affront, and spite mingled with the other\nmotives that brought him here. \"Thus it is, then,\" said he, grinding his\nteeth and speaking very fast. \"Your son Gerard is more like to be father\nof a family than a priest: he is for ever with Margaret, Peter Brandt's\nred-haired girl, and loves her like a cow her calf.\"\n\nMother and daughter both burst out laughing. Ghysbrecht stared at them.\n\n\"What! you knew it?\"\n\n\"Carry this tale to those who know not my son, Gerard. Women are nought\nto him.\"\n\n\"Other women, mayhap. But this one is the apple of his eye to him, or\nwill be, if you part them not, and soon. Come, dame, make me not waste\ntime and friendly counsel: my servant has seen them together a score\ntimes, handed, and reading babies in one another's eyes like--you know,\ndame--you have been young, too.\"\n\n\"Girl, I am ill at ease. Yea, I have been young, and know how blind\nand foolish the young are. My heart! he has turned me sick in a moment.\nKate, if it should be true?\"\n\n\"Nay, nay!\" cried Kate eagerly. \"Gerard might love a young woman: all\nyoung men do: I can't find what they see in them to love so; but if he\ndid, he would let us know; he would not deceive us. You wicked man!\nNo, dear mother, look not so! Gerard is too good to love a creature of\nearth. His love is for our Lady and the saints. Ah! I will show you the\npicture there: if his heart was earthly, could he paint the Queen\nof Heaven like that--look! look!\" and she held the picture out\ntriumphantly, and, more radiant and beautiful in this moment of\nenthusiasm than ever dead picture was or will be, over-powered the\nburgomaster with her eloquence and her feminine proof of Gerard's\npurity. His eyes and mouth opened, and remained open: in which state\nthey kept turning, face and all as if on a pivot, from the picture to\nthe women, and from the women to the picture.\n\n\"Why, it is herself,\" he gasped.\n\n\"Isn't it!\" cried Kate, and her hostility was softened. \"You admire it?\nI forgive you for frightening us.\"\n\n\"Am I in a mad-house?\" said Ghysbrecht Van Swieten thoroughly puzzled.\n\"You show me a picture of the girl; and you say he painted it; and that\nis a proof he cannot love her. Why, they all paint their sweethearts,\npainters do.\"\n\n\"A picture of the girl?\" exclaimed Kate, shocked. \"Fie! this is no girl;\nthis is our blessed Lady.\"\n\n\"No, no; it is Margaret Brandt.\"\n\n\"Oh blind! It is the Queen of Heaven.\"\n\n\"No; only of Sevenbergen village.\"\n\n\"Profane man! behold her crown!\"\n\n\"Silly child! look at her red hair! Would the Virgin be seen in red\nhair? She who had the pick of all the colours ten thousand years before\nthe world began.\"\n\nAt this moment an anxious face was insinuated round the edge of the open\ndoor: it was their neighbour Peter Buyskens.\n\n\"What is to do?\" said he in a cautious whisper. \"We can hear you all\nacross the street. What on earth is to do?\"\n\n\"Oh, neighbour! What is to do? Why, here is the burgomaster blackening\nour Gerard.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" cried Van Swieten. \"Peter Buyskens is come in the nick of time.\nHe knows father and daughter both. They cast their glamour on him.\"\n\n\"What! is she a witch too?\"\n\n\"Else the egg takes not after the bird. Why is her father called the\nmagician? I tell you they bewitched this very Peter here; they cast\nunholy spells on him, and cured him of the colic: now, Peter, look and\ntell me who is that? and you be silent, women, for a moment, if you can;\nwho is it, Peter?\"\n\n\"Well, to be sure!\" said Peter, in reply; and his eye seemed fascinated\nby the picture.\n\n\"Who is it?\" repeated Ghysbrecht impetuously.\n\nPeter Buyskens smiled. \"Why, you know as well as I do; but what have\nthey put a crown on her for? I never saw her in a crown, for my part.\"\n\n\"Man alive! Can't you open your great jaws, and just speak a wench's\nname plain out to oblige three people?\"\n\n\"I'd do a great deal more to oblige one of you than that, burgomaster.\nIf it isn't as natural as life!\"\n\n\"Curse the man! he won't, he won't--curse him!\"\n\n\"Why, what have I done now?\"\n\n\"Oh, sir!\" said little Kate, \"for pity's sake tell us; are these the\nfeatures of a living woman, of--of--Margaret Brandt?\"\n\n\"A mirror is not truer, my little maid.\"\n\n\"But is it she, sir, for very certain?\"\n\n\"Why, who else should it be?\"\n\n\"Now, why couldn't you say so at once?\" snarled Ghysbrecht.\n\n\"I did say so, as plain as I could speak,\" snapped Peter; and they\ngrowled over this small bone of contention so zealously, that they did\nnot see Catherine and her daughter had thrown their aprons over their\nheads, and were rocking to and fro in deep distress. The next moment\nElias came in from the shop, and stood aghast. Catherine, though her\nface was covered, knew his footstep.\n\n\"That is my poor man,\" she sobbed. \"Tell him, good Peter Buyskens, for I\nhave not the courage.\"\n\nElias turned pale. The presence of the burgomaster in his house, after\nso many years of coolness, coupled with his wife's and daughter's\ndistress, made him fear some heavy misfortune.\n\n\"Richart! Jacob!\" he gasped.\n\n\"No, no!\" said the burgomaster; \"it is nearer home, and nobody is dead\nor dying, old friend.\"\n\n\"God bless you, burgomaster! Ah! something has gone off my breast that\nwas like to choke me. Now, what is the matter?\"\n\nGhysbrecht then told him all that he told the women, and showed the\npicture in evidence.\n\n\"Is that all?\" said Eli, profoundly relieved. \"What are ye roaring and\nbellowing for? It is vexing--it is angering, but it is not like death,\nnot even sickness. Boys will be boys. He will outgrow that disease: 'tis\nbut skin-deep.\"\n\nBut when Ghysbrecht told him that Margaret was a girl of good character;\nthat it was not to be supposed she would be so intimate if marriage had\nnot been spoken of between them, his brow darkened.\n\n\"Marriage! that shall never be,\" said he sternly. \"I'll stay that; ay,\nby force, if need be--as I would his hand lifted to cut his throat. I'd\ndo what old John Koestein did t'other day.\"\n\n\"And what is that, in Heaven's name?\" asked the mother, suddenly\nremoving her apron.\n\nIt was the burgomaster who replied:\n\n\"He made me shut young Albert Koestein up in the prison of the\nStadthouse till he knocked under. It was not long: forty-eight hours,\nall alone, on bread and water, cooled his hot stomach. 'Tell my father I\nam his humble servant,' says he, 'and let me into the sun once more--the\nsun is worth all the wenches in the world.'\"\n\n\"Oh, the cruelty of men!\" sighed Catherine.\n\n\"As to that, the burgomaster has no choice: it is the law. And if a\nfather says, 'Burgomaster, lock up my son,' he must do it. A fine thing\nit would be if a father might not lock up his own son.\"\n\n\"Well, well! it won't come to that with me and my son. He never\ndisobeyed me in his life: he never shall, Where is he? It is past\nsupper-time. Where is he, Kate?\"\n\n\"Alas! I know not, father.\"\n\n\"I know,\" said Ghysbrecht; \"he is at Sevenbergen. My servant met him on\nthe road.\"\n\nSupper passed in gloomy silence. Evening descended--no Gerard! Eight\no'clock came--no Gerard! Then the father sent all to bed, except\nCatherine.\n\n\"You and I will walk abroad, wife, and talk over this new care.\"\n\n\"Abroad, my man, at this time? Whither?\"\n\n\"Why, on the road to Sevenbergen.\"\n\n\"Oh no; no hasty words, father. Poor Gerard! he never vexed you before.\"\n\n\"Fear me not. But it must end; and I am not one that trusts to-morrow\nwith to-day's work.\"\n\nThe old pair walked hand in hand; for, strange is it may appear to\nsome of my readers, the use of the elbow to couples walking was not\ndiscovered in Europe till centuries after this. They sauntered on a long\ntime in silence. The night was clear and balmy. Such nights, calm and\nsilent, recall the past from the dead.\n\n\"It is a many years since we walked so late, my man,\" said Catherine\nsoftly.\n\n\"Ay, sweetheart, more than we shall see again (is he never coming, I\nwonder?)\"\n\n\"Not since our courting days, Eli.\"\n\n\"No. Ay, you were a buxom lass then.\"\n\n\"And you were a comely lad, as ever a girl's eye stole a look at. I do\nsuppose Gerard is with her now, as you used to be with me. Nature is\nstrong, and the same in all our generations.\"\n\n\"Nay, I hope he has left her by now, confound her, or we shall be here\nall night.\"\n\n\"Eli!\"\n\n\"Well, Kate?\"\n\n\"I have been happy with you, sweetheart, for all our rubs--much happier,\nI trow, than if I had--been--a--a--nun. You won't speak harshly to the\npoor child? One can be firm without being harsh.\"\n\n\"Surely.\"\n\n\"Have you been happy with me, my poor Eli?\"\n\n\"Why, you know I have. Friends I have known, but none like thee. Buss\nme, wife!\"\n\n\"A heart to share joy and grief with is a great comfort to man or woman.\nIsn't it, Eli?\"\n\n\"It is so, my lass.\n\n     'It doth joy double,\n     And halveth trouble,'\n\nruns the byword. And so I have found it, sweetheart. Ah! here comes the\nyoung fool.\"\n\nCatherine trembled, and held her husband's hand tight.\n\nThe moon was bright, but they were in the shadow of some trees, and\ntheir son did not see them. He came singing in the moonlight, and his\nface shining.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nWhile the burgomaster was exposing Gerard at Tergou, Margaret had a\ntrouble of her own at Sevenbergen. It was a housewife's distress, but\ndeeper than we can well conceive. She came to Martin Wittenhaagen, the\nold soldier, with tears in her eyes.\n\n\"Martin, there's nothing in the house, and Gerard is coming, and he is\nso thoughtless. He forgets to sup at home. When he gives over work, then\nhe runs to me straight, poor soul; and often he comes quite faint. And\nto think I have nothing to set before my servant that loves me so dear.\"\n\nMartin scratched his head. \"What can I do?\"\n\n\"It is Thursday; it is your day to shoot; sooth to Say, I counted on you\nto-day.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the soldier, \"I may not shoot when the Duke or his friends\nare at the chase; read else. I am no scholar.\" And he took out of his\npouch a parchment with a grand seal. It purported to be a stipend and a\nlicence given by Philip, Duke of Burgundy, to Martin Wittenhaagen, one\nof his archers, in return for services in the wars, and for a wound\nreceived at the Dukes side. The stipend was four merks yearly, to be\npaid by the Duke's almoner, and the licence was to shoot three arrows\nonce a week, viz., on Thursday, and no other day, in any of the Duke's\nforests in Holland, at any game but a seven-year-old buck or a doe\ncarrying fawn; proviso, that the Duke should not be hunting on that day,\nor any of his friends. In this case Martin was not to go and disturb the\nwoods on peril of his salary and his head, and a fine of a penny.\n\nMargaret sighed and was silent.\n\n\"Come, cheer up, mistress,\" said he; \"for your sake I'll peril my\ncarcass; I have done that for many a one that was not worth your\nforefinger. It is no such mighty risk either. I'll but step into the\nskirts of the forest here. It is odds but they drive a hare or a fawn\nwithin reach of my arrow.\"\n\n\"Well, if I let you go, you must promise me not to go far, and not to\nbe seen; far better Gerard went supperless than ill should come to you,\nfaithful Martin.\"\n\nThe required promise given, Martin took his bow and three arrows, and\nstole cautiously into the wood: it was scarce a furlong distant. The\nhorns were heard faintly in the distance, and all the game was afoot.\n\"Come,\" thought Martin, \"I shall soon fill the pot, and no one be the\nwiser.\" He took his stand behind a thick oak that commanded a view of\nan open glade, and strung his bow, a truly formidable weapon. It was\nof English yew, six feet two inches high, and thick in proportion; and\nMartin, broad-chested, with arms all iron and cord, and used to the bow\nfrom infancy, could draw a three-foot arrow to the head, and, when\nit flew, the eye could scarce follow it, and the bowstring twanged as\nmusical as a harp. This bow had laid many a stout soldier low in the\nwars of the Hoecks and Cabbel-jaws. In those days a battlefield was not\na cloud of smoke; the combatants were few, but the deaths many--for they\nsaw what they were about; and fewer bloodless arrows flew than bloodless\nbullets now. A hare came cantering, then sat sprightly, and her ears\nmade a capital V. Martin levelled his tremendous weapon at her. The\narrow flew, the string twanged; but Martin had been in a hurry to pot\nher, and lost her by an inch: the arrow seemed to hit her, but it struck\nthe ground close to her, and passed under her belly like a flash, and\nhissed along the short grass and disappeared. She jumped three feet\nperpendicular and away at the top of her speed. \"Bungler!\" said Martin.\nA sure proof he was not an habitual bungler, or he would have blamed\nthe hare. He had scarcely fitted another arrow to his string when a\nwood-pigeon settled on the very tree he stood under. \"Aha!\" thought he,\n\"you are small, but dainty.\" This time he took more pains; drew his arrow\ncarefully, loosed it smoothly, and saw it, to all appearance, go clean\nthrough the bird, carrying feathers skyward like dust. Instead of\nfalling at his feet, the bird, whose breast was torn, not fairly\npierced, fluttered feebly away, and, by a great effort, rose above the\ntrees, flew some fifty yards and dead at last; but where, he could not\nsee for the thick foliage.\n\n\"Luck is against me,\" said he despondingly. But he fitted another arrow,\nand eyed the glade keenly. Presently he heard a bustle behind him, and\nturned round just in time to see a noble buck cross the open, but too\nlate to shoot at him. He dashed his bow down with an imprecation. At\nthat moment a long spotted animal glided swiftly across after the deer;\nits belly seemed to touch the ground as it went. Martin took up his bow\nhastily: he recognized the Duke's leopard. \"The hunters will not be far\nfrom her,\" said he, \"and I must not be seen. Gerard must go supperless\nthis night.\"\n\nHe plunged into the wood, following the buck and leopard, for that was\nhis way home. He had not gone far when he heard an unusual sound ahead\nof him--leaves rustling violently and the ground trampled. He hurried in\nthe direction. He found the leopard on the buck's back, tearing him\nwith teeth and claw, and the buck running in a circle and bounding\nconvulsively, with the blood pouring down his hide. Then Martin formed a\ndesperate resolution to have the venison for Margaret. He drew his arrow\nto the head, and buried it in the deer, who, spite of the creature on\nhis back, bounded high into the air, and fell dead. The leopard went on\ntearing him as if nothing had happened.\n\nMartin hoped that the creature would gorge itself with blood, and then\nlet him take the meat. He waited some minutes, then walked resolutely\nup, and laid his hand on the buck's leg. The leopard gave a frightful\ngrowl, and left off sucking blood. She saw Martin's game, and was\nsulky and on her guard. What was to be done? Martin had heard that wild\ncreatures cannot stand the human eye. Accordingly, he stood erect, and\nfixed his on the leopard: the leopard returned a savage glance, and\nnever took her eye off Martin. Then Martin continuing to look the beast\ndown, the leopard, brutally ignorant of natural history, flew at his\nhead with a frightful yell, flaming eyes, and jaws and distended. He had\nbut just time to catch her by the throat, before her teeth could crush\nhis face; one of her claws seized his shoulder and rent it, the other,\naimed at his cheek, would have been more deadly still, but Martin was\nold-fashioned, and wore no hat, but a scapulary of the same stuff as his\njerkin, and this scapulary he had brought over his head like a hood; the\nbrute's claw caught in the loose leather. Martin kept her teeth off his\nface with great difficulty, and griped her throat fiercely, and she\nkept rending his shoulder. It was like blunt reaping-hooks grinding and\ntearing. The pain was fearful; but, instead of cowing the old soldier,\nit put his blood up, and he gnashed his teeth with rage almost as fierce\nas hers, and squeezed her neck with iron force. The two pair of eyes\nflared at one another--and now the man's were almost as furious as the\nbrute's. She found he was throttling her, and made a wild attempt\nto free herself, in which she dragged his cowl all over his face and\nblinded him, and tore her claw out of his shoulder, flesh and all; but\nstill he throttled her with hand and arm of iron. Presently her\nlong tail, that was high in the air, went down. \"Aha!\" cried Martin,\njoyfully, and gripped her like death; next, her body lost its\nelasticity, and he held a choked and powerless thing: he gripped it\nstill, till all motion ceased, then dashed it to the earth; then,\npanting, removed his cowl: the leopard lay mute at his feet with tongue\nprotruding and bloody paw; and for the first time terror fell on Martin.\n\"I am a dead man: I have slain the Duke's leopard.\" He hastily seized\na few handfuls of leaves and threw them over her; then shouldered the\nbuck, and staggered away, leaving a trail of blood all the way his own\nand the buck's. He burst into Peter's house a horrible figure, bleeding\nand bloodstained, and flung the deer's carcass down.\n\n\"There--no questions,\" said he, \"but broil me a steak on't, for I am\nfaint.\"\n\nMargaret did not see he was wounded; she thought the blood was all from\nthe deer.\n\nShe busied herself at the fire, and the stout soldier stanched and bound\nhis own wound apart; and soon he and Gerard and Margaret were supping\nroyally on broiled venison.\n\nThey were very merry; and Gerard, with wonderful thoughtfulness, had\nbrought a flask of Schiedam, and under its influence Martin revived,\nand told them how the venison was got; and they all made merry over the\nexploit.\n\nTheir mirth was strangely interrupted. Margaret's eye became fixed and\nfascinated, and her cheek pale with fear. She gasped, and could not\nspeak, but pointed to the window with trembling finger. Their eyes\nfollowed hers, and there in the twilight crouched a dark form with eyes\nlike glowworms.\n\nIt was the leopard.\n\nWhile they stood petrified, fascinated by the eyes of green fire, there\nsounded in the wood a single deep bay. Martin trembled at it.\n\n\"They have lost her, and laid muzzled bloodhounds on her scent;\nthey will find her here, and the venison. Good-bye, friends, Martin\nWittenhaagen ends here.\"\n\nGerard seized his bow, and put it into the soldier's hands.\n\n\"Be a man,\" he cried; \"shoot her, and fling her into the wood ere they\ncome up. Who will know?\"\n\nMore voices of hounds broke out, and nearer.\n\n\"Curse her!\" cried Martin; \"I spared her once; now she must die, or I,\nor both more likely;\" and he reared his bow, and drew his arrow to the\nhead.\n\n\"Nay! nay!\" cried Margaret, and seized the arrow. It broke in half: the\npieces fell on each side the bow. The air at the same time filled with\nthe tongues of the hounds: they were hot upon the scent.\n\n\"What have you done, wench? You have put the halter round my throat.\"\n\n\"No!\" cried Margaret. \"I have saved you: stand back from the window,\nboth! Your knife, quick!\"\n\nShe seized his long-pointed knife, almost tore it out of his girdle, and\ndarted from the room. The house was now surrounded with baying dogs and\nshouting men.\n\nThe glowworm eyes moved not.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nMargaret cut off a huge piece of venison, and ran to the window and\nthrew it out to the green eyes of fire. They darted on to it with a\nsavage snarl; and there was a sound of rending and crunching: at this\nmoment, a hound uttered a bay so near and loud it rang through the\nhouse; and the three at the window shrank together. Then the leopard\nfeared for her supper, and glided swiftly and stealthily away with it\ntowards the woods, and the very next moment horses and men and dogs came\nhelter-skelter past the window, and followed her full cry. Martin and\nhis companions breathed again: the leopard was swift, and would not\nbe caught within a league of their house. They grasped hands. Margaret\nseized this opportunity, and cried a little; Gerard kissed the tears\naway.\n\nTo table once more, and Gerard drank to woman's wit: \"'Tis stronger than\nman's force,\" said he.\n\n\"Ay,\" said Margaret, \"when those she loves are in danger; not else.\"\n\nTo-night Gerard stayed with her longer than usual, and went home prouder\nthan ever of her, and happy as a prince. Some little distance from home,\nunder the shadow of some trees, he encountered two figures: they almost\nbarred his way.\n\nIt was his father and mother.\n\nOut so late! what could be the cause?\n\nA chill fell on him.\n\nHe stopped and looked at them: they stood grim and silent. He stammered\nout some words of inquiry.\n\n\"Why ask?\" said the father; \"you know why we are here.\"\n\n\"Oh, Gerard!\" said his mother, with a voice full of reproach yet of\naffection.\n\nGerard's heart quaked: he was silent.\n\nThen his father pitied his confusion, and said to him:\n\n\"Nay, you need not to hang your head. You are not the first young fool\nthat has been caught by a red cheek and a pair of blue eyes.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay!\" put in Catherine, \"it was witchcraft; Peter the Magician is\nwell known for that.\"\n\n\"Come, Sir Priest,\" resumed his father, \"you know you must not meddle\nwith women folk. But give us your promise to go no more to Sevenbergen,\nand here all ends: we won't be hard on you for one fault.\"\n\n\"I cannot promise that, father.\"\n\n\"Not promise it, you young hypocrite!\"\n\n\"Nay, father, miscall me not: I lacked courage to tell you what I knew\nwould vex you; and right grateful am I to that good friend, whoever he\nbe, that has let you wot. 'Tis a load off my mind. Yes, father, I love\nMargaret; and call me not a priest, for a priest I will never be. I will\ndie sooner.\"\n\n\"That we shall see, young man. Come, gainsay me no more; you will learn\nwhat 'tis to disrespect a father.\"\n\nGerard held his peace, and the three walked home in gloomy silence,\nbroken only by a deep sigh or two from Catherine.\n\nFrom that hour the little house at Tergou was no longer the abode of\npeace. Gerard was taken to task next day before the whole family; and\nevery voice was loud against him, except little Kate's and the dwarf's,\nwho was apt to take his cue from her without knowing why. As for\nCornelis and Sybrandt, they were bitterer than their father. Gerard\nwas dismayed at finding so many enemies, and looked wistfully into his\nlittle sister's face: her eyes were brimming at the harsh words showered\non one who but yesterday was the universal pet. But she gave him no\nencouragement: she turned her head away from him and said:\n\n\"Dear, dear Gerard, pray to Heaven to cure you of this folly!\"\n\n\"What, are you against me too?\" said Gerard, sadly; and he rose with a\ndeep sigh, and left the house and went to Sevenbergen.\n\nThe beginning of a quarrel, where the parties are bound by affection\nthough opposed in interest and sentiment, is comparatively innocent:\nboth are perhaps in the right at first starting, and then it is that\na calm, judicious friend, capable of seeing both sides, is a gift from\nHeaven. For the longer the dissension endures, the wider and deeper it\ngrows by the fallibility and irascibility of human nature: these are\nnot confined to either side, and finally the invariable end is\nreached--both in the wrong.\n\nThe combatants were unequally matched: Elias was angry, Cornelis and\nSybrandt spiteful; but Gerard, having a larger and more cultivated mind,\nsaw both sides where they saw but one, and had fits of irresolution,\nand was not wroth, but unhappy. He was lonely, too, in this struggle.\nHe could open his heart to no one. Margaret was a high-spirited girl:\nhe dared not tell her what he had to endure at home; she was capable of\nsiding with his relations by resigning him, though at the cost of her\nown happiness. Margaret Van Eyck had been a great comfort to him on\nanother occasion; but now he dared not make her his confidant. Her own\nhistory was well known. In early life she had many offers of marriage;\nbut refused them all for the sake of that art, to which a wife's and\nmother's duties are so fatal: thus she remained single and painted with\nher brothers. How could he tell her that he declined the benefice she\nhad got him, and declined it for the sake of that which at his age she\nhad despised and sacrificed so lightly?\n\nGerard at this period bade fair to succumb. But the other side had a\nhorrible ally in Catherine, senior. This good-hearted but uneducated\nwoman could not, like her daughter, act quietly and firmly: still less\ncould she act upon a plan. She irritated Gerard at times, and so helped\nhim; for anger is a great sustainer of the courage: at others she turned\nround in a moment and made onslaughts on her own forces. To take\na single instance out of many: one day that they were all at home,\nCatherine and all, Cornelis said: \"Our Gerard wed Margaret Brandt? Why,\nit is hunger marrying thirst.\"\n\n\"And what will it be when you marry?\" cried Catherine. \"Gerard can\npaint, Gerard can write, but what can you do to keep a woman, ye lazy\nloon? Nought but wait for your father's shoon. Oh we can see why you and\nSybrandt would not have the poor boy to marry. You are afraid he will\ncome to us for a share of our substance. And say that he does, and say\nthat we give it him, it isn't yourn we part from, and mayhap never will\nbe.\"\n\nOn these occasions Gerard smiled slily, and picked up heart, and\ntemporary confusion fell on Catherine's unfortunate allies. But at last,\nafter more than six months of irritation, came the climax. The father\ntold the son before the whole family he had ordered the burgomaster\nto imprison him in the Stadthouse rather than let him marry Margaret.\nGerard turned pale with anger at this, but by a great effort held his\npeace. His father went on to say, \"And a priest you shall be before the\nyear is out, nilly-willy.\"\n\n\"Is it so?\" cried Gerard. \"Then, hear me, all. By God and St. Bavon I\nswear I will never be a priest while Margaret lives. Since force is to\ndecide it, and not love and duty, try force, father; but force shall not\nserve you, for the day I see the burgomaster come for me, I leave Tergou\nfor ever, and Holland too, and my father's house, where it seems I have\nbeen valued all these years, not for myself, but for what is to be got\nout of me.\"\n\nAnd he flung out of the room white with anger and desperation.\n\n\"There!\" cried Catherine, \"that comes of driving young folks too hard.\nBut men are crueller than tigers, even to their own flesh and blood.\nNow, Heaven forbid he should ever leave us, married or single.\"\n\nAs Gerard came out of the house, his cheeks pale and his heart panting,\nhe met Reicht Heynes: she had a message for him: Margaret Van Eyck\ndesired to see him. He found the old lady seated grim as a judge. She\nwasted no time in preliminaries, but inquired coldly why he had not\nvisited her of late: before he could answer, she said in a sarcastic\ntone, \"I thought we had been friends, young sir.\"\n\nAt this Gerard looked the picture of doubt and consternation.\n\n\"It is because you never told her you were in love,\" said Reicht Heynes,\npitying his confusion.\n\n\"Silence, wench! Why should he tell us his affairs? We are not his\nfriends: we have not deserved his confidence.\"\n\n\"Alas! my second mother,\" said Gerard, \"I did not dare to tell you my\nfolly.\"\n\n\"What folly? Is it folly to love?\"\n\n\"I am told so every day of my life.\"\n\n\"You need not have been afraid to tell my mistress; she is always kind\nto true lovers.\"\n\n\"Madam--Reicht I was afraid because I was told...\"\n\n\"Well, you were told--?\"\n\n\"That in your youth you scorned love, preferring art.\"\n\n\"I did, boy; and what is the end of it? Behold me here a barren stock,\nwhile the women of my youth have a troop of children at their side, and\ngrandchildren at their knee I gave up the sweet joys of wifehood and\nmotherhood for what? For my dear brothers. They have gone and left me\nlong ago. For my art. It has all but left me too. I have the knowledge\nstill, but what avails that when the hand trembles. No, Gerard; I look\non you as my son. You are good, you are handsome, you are a painter,\nthough not like some I have known. I will not let you throw your youth\naway as I did mine: you shall marry this Margaret. I have inquired, and\nshe is a good daughter. Reicht here is a gossip. She has told me all\nabout it. But that need not hinder you to tell me.\"\n\nPoor Gerard was overjoyed to be permitted to praise Margaret aloud, and\nto one who could understand what he loved in her.\n\nSoon there were two pair of wet eyes over his story; and when the poor\nboy saw that, there were three.\n\nWomen are creatures brimful of courage. Theirs is not exactly the same\nquality as manly courage; that would never do, hang it all; we should\nhave to give up trampling on them. No; it is a vicarious courage. They\nnever take part in a bull-fight by any chance; but it is remarked that\nthey sit at one unshaken by those tremors and apprehensions for the\ncombatants to which the male spectator--feeble-minded wretch!--is\nsubject. Nothing can exceed the resolution with which they have been\nknown to send forth men to battle: as some witty dog says,\n\n\"Les femmes sont tres braves avec le peur d'autrui.\"\n\nBy this trait Gerard now profited. Margaret and Reicht were agreed that\na man should always take the bull by the horns. Gerard's only course was\nto marry Margaret Brandt off-hand; the old people would come to after\na while, the deed once done. Whereas, the longer this misunderstanding\ncontinued on its present footing, the worse for all parties, especially\nfor Gerard.\n\n\"See how pale and thin they have made him amongst them.\"\n\n\"Indeed you are, Master Gerard,\" said Reicht. \"It makes a body sad to\nsee a young man so wasted and worn. Mistress, when I met him in the\nstreet to-day, I had liked to have burst out crying: he was so changed.\n\n\"And I'll be bound the others keep their colour; ah, Reicht? such as it\nis.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see no odds in them.\"\n\n\"Of course not. We painters are no match for boors. We are glass, they\nare stone. We can't stand the worry, worry, worry of little minds; and\nit is not for the good of mankind we should be exposed to it. It is hard\nenough, Heaven knows, to design and paint a masterpiece, without having\ngnats and flies stinging us to death into the bargain.\"\n\nExasperated as Gerard was by his father's threat of violence, he\nlistened to these friendly voices telling him the prudent course was\nrebellion. But though he listened, he was not convinced.\n\n\"I do not fear my father's violence,\" he said, \"but I do fear his\nanger. When it came to the point he would not imprison me. I would marry\nMargaret to-morrow if that was my only fear. No; he would disown me. I\nshould take Margaret from her father, and give her a poor husband,\nwho would never thrive, weighed down by his parent's curse. Madam! I\nsometimes think if I could marry her secretly, and then take her away\nto some country where my craft is better paid than in this; and after\na year or two, when the storm had blown over, you know, could come back\nwith money in my purse, and say, 'My dear parents, we do not seek your\nsubstance, we but ask you to love us once more as you used, and as we\nhave never ceased to love you'--but, alas! I shall be told these are the\ndreams of an inexperienced young man.\"\n\nThe old lady's eyes sparkled.\n\n\"It is no dream, but a piece of wonderful common-sense in a boy;\nit remains to be seen whether you have spirit to carry out your own\nthought. There is a country, Gerard, where certain fortune awaits you\nat this moment. Here the arts freeze, but there they flourish, as they\nnever yet flourished in any age or land.\"\n\n\"It is Italy!\" cried Gerard. \"It is Italy!\"\n\n\"Ay, Italy! where painters are honoured like princes, and scribes are\npaid three hundred crowns for copying a single manuscript. Know you not\nthat his Holiness the Pope has written to every land for skilful scribes\nto copy the hundreds of precious manuscripts that are pouring into that\nfavoured land from Constantinople, whence learning and learned men are\ndriven by the barbarian Turks?\"\n\n\"Nay, I know not that; but it has been the dream and hope of my life to\nvisit Italy, the queen of all the arts; oh, madam! But the journey, and\nwe are all so poor.\"\n\n\"Find you the heart to go, I'll find the means. I know where to lay my\nhand on ten golden angels: they will take you to Rome: and the girl with\nyou, if she loves you as she ought.\"\n\nThey sat till midnight over this theme. And, after that day, Gerard\nrecovered his spirits, and seemed to carry a secret talisman against all\nthe gibes and the harsh words that flew about his ears at home.\n\nBesides the money she procured him for the journey, Margaret Van Eyck\ngave him money's worth. Said she, \"I will tell you secrets that I\nlearned from masters that are gone from me, and have left no fellow\nbehind. Even the Italians know them not; and what I tell you now in\nTergou you shall sell here in Florence. Note my brother Jan's pictures:\ntime, which fades all other paintings, leaves his colours bright as the\nday they left the easel. The reason is, he did nothing blindly, in\na hurry. He trusted to no hireling to grind his colours; he did it\nhimself, or saw it done. His panel was prepared and prepared again--I\nwill show you how--a year before he laid his colour on. Most of them are\nquite content to have their work sucked up and lost, sooner than not\nbe in a hurry. Bad painters are always in a hurry. Above all, Gerard,\nI warn you use but little oil, and never boil it: boiling it melts that\nvegetable dross into its heart which it is our business to clear away;\nfor impure oil is death to colour. No; take your oil and pour it into\na bottle with water. In a day or two the water will turn muddy: that is\nmuck from the oil. Pour the dirty water carefully away and add fresh.\nWhen that is poured away, you will fancy the oil is clear. You're\nmistaken. Reicht, fetch me that!\" Reicht brought a glass trough with a\nglass lid fitting tight. \"When your oil has been washed in bottle, put\nit into this trough with water, and put the trough in the sun all day.\nYou will soon see the water turbid again. But mark, you must not carry\nthis game too far, or the sun will turn your oil to varnish. When it is\nas clear as crystal, not too luscious, drain carefully, and cork it up\ntight. Grind your own prime colours, and lay them on with this oil, and\nthey shall live. Hubert would put sand or salt in the water to clear the\noil quicker. But Jan used to say, 'Water will do it best; give water\ntime.' Jan Van Eyck was never in a hurry, and that is why the world will\nnot forget him in a hurry.\"\n\nThis and several other receipts, quae nunc perscribere longum est,\nMargaret gave him with sparkling eyes, and Gerard received them like\na legacy from Heaven, so interesting are some things that read\nuninteresting. Thus provided with money and knowledge, Gerard decided to\nmarry and fly with his wife to Italy. Nothing remained now but to inform\nMargaret Brandt of his resolution, and to publish the banns as quietly\nas possible. He went to Sevenbergen earlier than usual on both these\nerrands. He began with Margaret; told her of the Dame Van Eyck's\ngoodness, and the resolution he had come to at last, and invited her\nco-operation.\n\nShe refused it plump.\n\n\"No, Gerard; you and I have never spoken of your family, but when you\ncome to marriage--\" She stopped, then began again. \"I do think your\nfather has no ill-will to me more than to another. He told Peter\nBuyskens as much, and Peter told me. But so long as he is bent on your\nbeing a priest (you ought have told me this instead of I you), I could\nnot marry you, Gerard, dearly as I love you.\"\n\nGerard strove in vain to shake this resolution. He found it very easy\nto make her cry, but impossible to make her yield. Then Gerard was\nimpatient and unjust.\n\n\"Very well!\" he cried; \"then you are on their side, and you will drive\nme to be a priest, for this must end one way or another. My parents hate\nme in earnest, but my lover only loves me in jest.\"\n\nAnd with this wild, bitter speech, he flung away home again, and left\nMargaret weeping.\n\nWhen a man misbehaves, the effect is curious on a girl who loves him\nsincerely. It makes her pity him. This, to some of us males, seems\nanything but logical. The fault is in our own eye; the logic is too\nswift for us. The girl argues thus:--\"How unhappy, how vexed, how poor\nhe must be to misbehave! Poor thing!\"\n\nMargaret was full of this sweet womanly pity, when, to her great\nsurprise, scarce an hour and a half after he left her, Gerard came\nrunning back to her with the fragments of a picture in his hand, and\npanting with anger and grief.\n\n\"There, Margaret! see! see! the wretches! Look at their spite! They have\ncut your portrait to pieces.\"\n\nMargaret looked, and, sure enough, some malicious hand had cut her\nportrait into five pieces. She was a good girl, but she was not ice; she\nturned red to her very forehead.\n\n\"Who did it?\"\n\n\"Nay, I know not. I dared not ask; for I should hate the hand that did\nit, ay, till my dying day. My poor Margaret! The butchers, the ruffians!\nSix months' work cut out of my life, and nothing to show for it now.\nSee, they have hacked through your very face; the sweet face that every\none loves who knows it. Oh, heartless, merciless vipers!\"\n\n\"Never mind, Gerard,\" said Margaret, panting. \"Since this is how they\ntreat you for my sake--Ye rob him of my portrait, do ye? Well, then, he\nshall have the face itself, such as it is.\"\n\n\"Oh, Margaret!\"\n\n\"Yes, Gerard; since they are so cruel, I will be the kinder: forgive\nme for refusing you. I will be your wife: to-morrow, if it is your\npleasure.\"\n\nGerard kissed her hands with rapture, and then her lips; and in a tumult\nof joy ran for Peter and Martin. They came and witnessed the betrothal;\na solemn ceremony in those days, and indeed for more than a century\nlater, though now abolished.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nThe banns of marriage had to be read three times, as in our days; with\nthis difference, that they were commonly read on week-days, and the\nyoung couple easily persuaded the cure to do the three readings in\ntwenty-four hours: he was new to the place, and their looks spoke\nvolumes in their favour. They were cried on Monday at matins and at\nvespers; and, to their great delight, nobody from Tergou was in the\nchurch. The next morning they were both there, palpitating with anxiety,\nwhen, to their horror, a stranger stood up and forbade the banns, On\nthe score that the parties were not of age, and their parents not\nconsenting.\n\nOutside the church door Margaret and Gerard held a trembling, and almost\ndespairing consultation; but, before they could settle anything, the man\nwho had done them so ill a turn approached, and gave them to understand\nthat he was very sorry to interfere: that his inclination was to further\nthe happiness of the young; but that in point of fact his only means of\ngetting a living was by forbidding banns: what then? \"The young people\ngive me a crown, and I undo my work handsomely; tell the cure I was\nmisinformed, and all goes smoothly.\"\n\n\"A crown! I will give you a golden angel to do this,\" said Gerard\neagerly; the man consented as eagerly, and went with Gerard to the cure,\nand told him he had made a ridiculous mistake, which a sight of the\nparties had rectified. On this the cure agreed to marry the young couple\nnext day at ten: and the professional obstructor of bliss went home with\nGerard's angel. Like most of these very clever knaves, he was a fool,\nand proceeded to drink his angel at a certain hostelry in Tergou where\nwas a green devoted to archery and the common sports of the day. There,\nbeing drunk, he bragged of his day's exploit; and who should be\nthere, imbibing every word, but a great frequenter of the spot, the\nne'er-do-weel Sybrandt. Sybrandt ran home to tell his father; his father\nwas not at home; he was gone to Rotterdam to buy cloth of the merchants.\nCatching his elder brother's eye, he made him a signal to come out, and\ntold him what he had heard.\n\nThere are black sheep in nearly every large family; and these two were\nGerard's black brothers. Idleness is vitiating: waiting for the death of\nthose we ought to love is vitiating; and these two one-idea'd curs were\nready to tear any one to death that should interfere with that miserable\ninheritance which was their thought by day and their dream by night.\nTheir parents' parsimony was a virtue; it was accompanied by industry,\nand its motive was love of their offspring; but in these perverse and\nselfish hearts that homely virtue was perverted into avarice, than which\nno more fruitful source of crimes is to be found in nature.\n\nThey put their heads together, and agreed not to tell their mother,\nwhose sentiments were so uncertain, but to go first to the burgomaster.\nThey were cunning enough to see that he was averse to the match, though\nthey could not divine why.\n\nGhysbrecht Van Swieten saw through them at once; but he took care not\nto let them see through him. He heard their story, and putting on\nmagisterial dignity and coldness, he said;\n\n\"Since the father of the family is not here, his duty falleth on me, who\nam the father of the town. I know your father's mind; leave all to me;\nand, above all, tell not a woman a word of this, least of all the women\nthat are in your own house: for chattering tongues mar wisest counsels.\"\n\nSo he dismissed them, a little superciliously: he was ashamed of his\nconfederates.\n\nOn their return home they found their brother Gerard seated on a low\nstool at their mother's knee: she was caressing his hair with her hand,\nspeaking very kindly to him, and promising to take his part with his\nfather and thwart his love no more. The main cause of this change of\nmind was characteristic of the woman. She it was who in a moment of\nfemale irritation had cut Margaret's picture to pieces. She had watched\nthe effect with some misgivings, and had seen Gerard turn pale as death,\nand sit motionless like a bereaved creature, with the pieces in his\nhands, and his eyes fixed on them till tears came and blinded them. Then\nshe was terrified at what she had done; and next her heart smote her\nbitterly; and she wept sore apart; but, being what she was, dared not\nown it, but said to herself, \"I'll not say a word, but I'll make it up\nto him.\" And her bowels yearned over her son, and her feeble violence\ndied a natural death, and she was transferring her fatal alliance to\nGerard when the two black sheep came in. Gerard knew nothing of the\nimmediate cause; on the contrary, inexperienced as he was in the ins\nand outs of females, her kindness made him ashamed of a suspicion he\nhad entertained that she was the depredator, and he kissed her again\nand again, and went to bed happy as a prince to think his mother was his\nmother once more at the very crisis of his fate.\n\nThe next morning, at ten o'clock, Gerard and Margaret were in the church\nat Sevenbergen, he radiant with joy, she with blushes. Peter was\nalso there, and Martin Wittenhaagen, but no other friend. Secrecy was\neverything. Margaret had declined Italy. She could not leave her father;\nhe was too learned and too helpless. But it was settled they should\nretire into Flanders for a few weeks until the storm should be blown\nover at Tergou. The cure did not keep them waiting long, though it\nseemed an age. Presently he stood at the altar, and called them to him.\nThey went hand in hand, the happiest in Holland. The cure opened his\nbook.\n\nBut ere he uttered a single word of the sacred rite, a harsh voice cried\n\"Forbear!\" And the constables of Tergou came up the aisle and seized\nGerard in the name of the law. Martin's long knife flashed out directly.\n\n\"Forbear, man!\" cried the priest. \"What! draw your weapon in a church,\nand ye who interrupt this holy sacrament, what means this impiety?\"\n\n\"There is no impiety, father,\" said the burgomaster's servant\nrespectfully. \"This young man would marry against his father's will, and\nhis father has prayed our burgomaster to deal with him according to the\nlaw. Let him deny it if he can.\"\n\n\"Is this so, young man?\"\n\nGerard hung his head.\n\n\"We take him to Rotterdam to abide the sentence of the Duke.\"\n\nAt this Margaret uttered a cry of despair, and the young creatures, who\nwere so happy a moment ago, fell to sobbing in one another's arms so\npiteously, that the instruments of oppression drew back a step and were\nashamed; but one of them that was good-natured stepped up under pretence\nof separating them, and whispered to Margaret:\n\n\"Rotterdam? it is a lie. We but take him to our Stadthouse.\"\n\nThey took him away on horseback, on the road to Rotterdam; and, after a\ndozen halts, and by sly detours, to Tergou. Just outside the town they\nwere met by a rude vehicle covered with canvas. Gerard was put into\nthis, and about five in the evening was secretly conveyed into the\nprison of the Stadthouse. He was taken up several flights of stairs\nand thrust into a small room lighted only by a narrow window, with a\nvertical iron bar. The whole furniture was a huge oak chest.\n\nImprisonment in that age was one of the highroads to death. It is\nhorrible in its mildest form; but in those days it implied cold,\nunbroken solitude, torture, starvation, and often poison. Gerard felt he\nwas in the hands of an enemy.\n\n\"Oh, the look that man gave me on the road to Rotterdam. There is more\nhere than my father's wrath. I doubt I shall see no more the light of\nday.\" And he kneeled down and commended his soul to God.\n\nPresently he rose and sprang at the iron bar of the window, and clutched\nit. This enabled him to look out by pressing his knees against the wall.\nIt was but for a minute; but in that minute he saw a sight such as none\nbut a captive can appreciate.\n\nMartin Wittenhaagen's back.\n\nMartin was sitting, quietly fishing in the brook near the Stadthouse.\n\nGerard sprang again at the window, and whistled. Martin instantly showed\nthat he was watching much harder than fishing. He turned hastily round\nand saw Gerard--made him a signal, and taking up his line and bow, went\nquickly off.\n\nGerard saw by this that his friends were not idle: yet had rather Martin\nhad stayed. The very sight of him was a comfort. He held on, looking\nat the soldier's retiring form as long as he could, then falling back\nsomewhat heavily wrenched the rusty iron bar, held only by rusty nails,\naway from the stone-work just as Ghysbrecht Van Swieten opened the door\nstealthily behind him. The burgomaster's eye fell instantly on the iron,\nand then glanced at the window; but he said nothing. The window was a\nhundred feet from the ground; and if Gerard had a fancy for jumping out,\nwhy should he balk it? He brought a brown loaf and a pitcher of water,\nand set them on the chest in solemn silence. Gerard's first impulse\nwas to brain him with the iron bar and fly down the stairs; but the\nburgomaster seeing something wicked in his eye, gave a little cough, and\nthree stout fellows, armed, showed themselves directly at the door.\n\n\"My orders are to keep you thus until you shall bind yourself by an oath\nto leave Margaret Brandt, and return to the Church, to which you have\nbelonged from your cradle.\"\n\n\"Death sooner.\"\n\n\"With all my heart.\" And the burgomaster retired.\n\nMartin went with all speed to Sevenbergen; there he found Margaret pale\nand agitated, but full of resolution and energy. She was just finishing\na letter to the Countess Charolois, appealing to her against the\nviolence and treachery of Ghysbrecht.\n\n\"Courage!\" cried Martin on entering. \"I have found him. He is in the\nhaunted tower, right at the top of it. Ay, I know the place: many a poor\nfellow has gone up there straight, and come down feet foremost.\"\n\nHe then told them how he had looked up and seen Gerard's face at a\nwindow that was like a slit in the wall.\n\n\"Oh, Martin! how did he look?\"\n\n\"What mean you? He looked like Gerard Eliassoen.\"\n\n\"But was he pale?\"\n\n\"A little.\"\n\n\"Looked he anxious? Looked he like one doomed?\"\n\n\"Nay, nay; as bright as a pewter pot.\"\n\n\"You mock me. Stay! then that must have been at sight of you. He counts\non us. Oh, what shall we do? Martin, good friend, take this at once to\nRotterdam.\"\n\nMartin held out his hand for the letter.\n\nPeter had sat silent all this time, but pondering, and yet, contrary to\ncustom, keenly attentive to what was going on around him.\n\n\"Put not your trust in princes,\" said he.\n\n\"Alas! what else have we to trust in?\"\n\n\"Knowledge.\"\n\n\"Well-a-day, father! your learning will not serve us here.\"\n\n\"How know you that? Wit has been too strong for iron bars ere to-day.\n\n\"Ay, father; but nature is stronger than wit, and she is against us.\nThink of the height! No ladder in Holland might reach him.\"\n\n\"I need no ladder; what I need is a gold crown.\"\n\n\"Nay, I have money, for that matter. I have nine angels. Gerard gave\nthem me to keep; but what do they avail? The burgomaster will not be\nbribed to let Gerard free.\"\n\n\"What do they avail? Give me but one crown, and the young man shall sup\nwith us this night.\"\n\nPeter spoke so eagerly and confidently, that for a moment Margaret\nfelt hopeful; but she caught Martin's eye dwelling upon him with an\nexpression of benevolent contempt.\n\n\"It passes the powers of man's invention,\" said she, with a deep sigh.\n\n\"Invention!\" cried the old man. \"A fig for invention. What need we\ninvention at this time of day? Everything has been said that is to be\nsaid, and done that ever will be done. I shall tell you how a Florentine\nknight was shut up in a tower higher than Gerard's; yet did his faithful\nsquire stand at the tower foot and get him out, with no other engine\nthan that in your hand, Martin, and certain kickshaws I shall buy for a\ncrown.\"\n\nMartin looked at his bow, and turned it round in his hand, and seemed to\ninterrogate it. But the examination left him as incredulous as before.\n\nThen Peter told them his story, how the faithful squire got the knight\nout of a high tower at Brescia. The manoeuvre, like most things that\nare really scientific, was so simple, that now their wonder was they had\ntaken for impossible what was not even difficult.\n\nThe letter never went to Rotterdam. They trusted to Peter's learning and\ntheir own dexterity.\n\nIt was nine o'clock on a clear moonlight night; Gerard, senior, was\nstill away; the rest of his little family had been some time abed.\n\nA figure stood by the dwarf's bed. It was white, and the moonlight shone\non it.\n\nWith an unearthly noise, between a yell and a snarl, the gymnast rolled\noff his bed and under it by a single unbroken movement. A soft voice\nfollowed him in his retreat.\n\n\"Why, Giles, are you afeard of me?\"\n\nAt this, Giles's head peeped cautiously up, and he saw it was only his\nsister Kate.\n\nShe put her finger to her lips. \"Hush! lest the wicked Cornelis or the\nwicked Sybrandt hear us.\" Giles's claws seized the side of the bed, and\nhe returned to his place by one undivided gymnastic.\n\nKate then revealed to Giles that she had heard Cornelis and Sybrandt\nmention Gerard's name; and being herself in great anxiety at his not\ncoming home all day, had listened at their door, and had made a fearful\ndiscovery. Gerard was in prison, in the haunted tower of the Stadthouse.\nHe was there, it seemed, by their father's authority. But here must be\nsome treachery; for how could their father have ordered this cruel act?\nHe was at Rotterdam. She ended by entreating Giles to bear her company\nto the foot of the haunted tower, to say a word of comfort to poor\nGerard, and let him know their father was absent, and would be sure to\nrelease him on his return.\n\n\"Dear Giles, I would go alone, but I am afeard of the spirits that men\nsay do haunt the tower; but with you I shall not be afeard.\"\n\n\"Nor I with you,\" said Giles. \"I don't believe there are any spirits in\nTergou. I never saw one. This last was the likest one ever I saw; and it\nwas but you, Kate, after all.\"\n\nIn less than half an hour Giles and Kate opened the housedoor cautiously\nand issued forth. She made him carry a lantern, though the night was\nbright. \"The lantern gives me more courage against the evil spirits,\"\nsaid she.\n\nThe first day of imprisonment is very trying, especially if to the\nhorror of captivity is added the horror of utter solitude. I observe\nthat in our own day a great many persons commit suicide during the first\ntwenty-four hours of the solitary cell. This is doubtless why our Jairi\nabstain so carefully from the impertinence of watching their little\nexperiment upon the human soul at that particular stage of it.\n\nAs the sun declined, Gerard's heart too sank and sank; with the waning\nlight even the embers of hope went out. He was faint, too, with hunger;\nfor he was afraid to eat the food Ghysbrecht had brought him; and hunger\nalone cows men. He sat upon the chest, his arms and his head drooping\nbefore him, a picture of despondency. Suddenly something struck the wall\nbeyond him very sharply, and then rattled on the floor at his feet. It\nwas an arrow; he saw the white feather. A chill ran through him--they\nmeant then to assassinate him from the outside. He crouched. No more\nmissiles came. He crawled on all fours, and took up the arrow; there was\nno head to it. He uttered a cry of hope: had a friendly hand shot it? He\ntook it up, and felt it all over: he found a soft substance attached\nto it. Then one of his eccentricities was of grand use to him. His\ntinder-box enabled him to strike a light: it showed him two things that\nmade his heart bound with delight, none the less thrilling for being\nsomewhat vague. Attached to the arrow was a skein of silk, and on the\narrow itself were words written.\n\nHow his eyes devoured them, his heart panting the while!\n\nWell beloved, make fast the silk to thy knife and lower to us: but hold\nthine end fast: then count an hundred and draw up.\n\nGerard seized the oak chest, and with almost superhuman energy dragged\nit to the window: a moment ago he could not have moved it. Standing on\nthe chest and looking down, he saw figures at the tower foot. They were\nso indistinct, they looked like one huge form. He waved his bonnet to\nthem with trembling hand: then he undid the silk rapidly but carefully,\nand made one end fast to his knife and lowered it till it ceased to\ndraw. Then he counted a hundred. Then pulled the silk carefully up: it\ncame up a little heavier. At last he came to a large knot, and by that\nknot a stout whipcord was attached to the silk. What could this mean?\nWhile he was puzzling himself Margaret's voice came up to him, low but\nclear. \"Draw up, Gerard, till you see liberty.\" At the word Gerard drew\nthe whipcord line up, and drew and drew till he came to another knot,\nand found a cord of some thickness take the place of the whipcord. He\nhad no sooner begun to draw this up, than he found that he had now a\nheavy weight to deal with. Then the truth suddenly flashed on him, and\nhe went to work and pulled and pulled till the perspiration rolled down\nhim: the weight got heavier and heavier, and at last he was well-nigh\nexhausted: looking down, he saw in the moonlight a sight that revived\nhim: it was as it were a great snake coming up to him out of the deep\nshadow cast by the tower. He gave a shout of joy, and a score more wild\npulls, and lo! a stout new rope touched his hand: he hauled and hauled,\nand dragged the end into his prison, and instantly passed it through\nboth handles of the chest in succession, and knotted it firmly; then sat\nfor a moment to recover his breath and collect his courage. The\nfirst thing was to make sure that the chest was sound, and capable of\nresisting his weight poised in mid-air. He jumped with all his force\nupon it. At the third jump the whole side burst open, and out scuttled\nthe contents, a host of parchments.\n\nAfter the first start and misgiving this gave him, Gerard comprehended\nthat the chest had not burst, but opened: he had doubtless jumped upon\nsome secret spring. Still it shook in some degree his confidence in the\nchest's powers of resistance; so he gave it an ally: he took the iron\nbar and fastened it with the small rope across the large rope, and\nacross the window. He now mounted the chest, and from the chest put his\nfoot through the window, and sat half in and half out, with one hand on\nthat part of the rope which was inside. In the silent night he heard his\nown heart beat.\n\nThe free air breathed on his face, and gave him the courage to risk what\nwe must all lose one day--for liberty. Many dangers awaited him, but the\ngreatest was the first getting on to the rope outside. Gerard reflected.\nFinally, he put himself in the attitude of a swimmer, his body to the\nwaist being in the prison, his legs outside. Then holding the inside\nrope with both hands, he felt anxiously with his feet for the outside\nrope, and when he had got it, he worked it in between the palms of his\nfeet, and kept it there tight: then he uttered a short prayer, and, all\nthe calmer for it, put his left hand on the sill and gradually wriggled\nout. Then he seized the iron bar, and for one fearful moment hung\noutside from it by his right hand, while his left hand felt for the rope\ndown at his knees; it was too tight against the wall for his fingers to\nget round it higher up. The moment he had fairly grasped it, he left the\nbar, and swiftly seized the rope with the right hand too; but in this\nmanoeuvre his body necessarily fell about a yard. A stifled cry came up\nfrom below. Gerard hung in mid-air. He clenched his teeth, and nipped\nthe rope tight with his feet and gripped it with his hands, and went\ndown slowly hand below hand. He passed by one huge rough stone after\nanother. He saw there was green moss on one. He looked up and he looked\ndown. The moon shone into his prison window: it seemed very near. The\nfluttering figures below seemed an awful distance. It made him dizzy to\nlook down: so he fixed his eyes steadily on the wall close to him, and\nwent slowly down, down, down.\n\nHe passed a rusty, slimy streak on the wall: it was some ten feet long.\nThe rope made his hands very hot. He stole another look up.\n\nThe prison window was a good way off now.\n\nDown--down--down--down.\n\nThe rope made his hands sore.\n\nHe looked up. The window was so distant, he ventured now to turn his\neyes downward again; and there, not more than thirty feet below him,\nwere Margaret and Martin, their faithful hands upstretched to catch him\nshould he fall. He could see their eyes and their teeth shine in the\nmoonlight. For their mouths were open, and they were breathing hard.\n\n\"Take care, Gerard oh, take care! Look not down.\"\n\n\"Fear me not,\" cried Gerard joyfully, and eyed the wall, but came down\nfaster.\n\nIn another minute his feet were at their hands. They seized him ere he\ntouched the ground, and all three clung together in one embrace.\n\n\"Hush! away in silence, dear one.\"\n\nThey stole along the shadow of the wall.\n\nNow, ere they had gone many yards, suddenly a stream of light shot from\nan angle of the building, and lay across their path like a barrier of\nfire, and they heard whispers and footsteps close at hand.\n\n\"Back!\" hissed Martin. \"Keep in the shade.\"\n\nThey hurried back, passed the dangling rope, and made for a little\nsquare projecting tower. They had barely rounded it when the light shot\ntrembling past them, and flickered uncertainly into the distance.\n\n\"A lantern!\" groaned Martin in a whisper. \"They are after us.\"\n\n\"Give me my knife,\" whispered Gerard. \"I'll never be taken alive.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" murmured Margaret; \"is there no way out where we are?\"\n\n\"None! none! But I carry six lives at my shoulder;\" and with the word,\nMartin strung his bow, and fitted an arrow to the string: \"in war never\nwait to be struck: I will kill one or two ere they shall know where\ntheir death comes from:\" then, motioning his companions to be quiet he\nbegan to draw his bow, and, ere the arrow was quite drawn to the head,\nhe glided round the corner ready to loose the string the moment the\nenemy should offer a mark.\n\nGerard and Margaret held their breath in horrible expectation: they had\nnever seen a human being killed.\n\nAnd now a wild hope, but half repressed, thrilled through Gerard, that\nthis watchful enemy might be the burgomaster in person. The soldier, he\nknew, would send an arrow through a burgher or burgomaster, as he would\nthrough a boar in a wood.\n\nBut who may foretell the future, however near? The bow, instead of\nremaining firm, and loosing the deadly shaft, was seen to waver first,\nthen shake violently, and the stout soldier staggered back to them, his\nknees knocking and his cheeks blanched with fear. He let his arrow fall,\nand clutched Gerard's shoulder.\n\n\"Let me feel flesh and blood,\" he gasped. \"The haunted tower! the\nhaunted tower!\"\n\nHis terror communicated itself to Margaret and Gerard. They gasped\nrather than uttered an inquiry.\n\n\"Hush!\" he cried, \"it will hear you up the wall! it is going up the\nwall! Its head is on fire. Up the wall, as mortal creatures walk upon\ngreen sward. If you know a prayer, say it, for hell is loose to-night.\"\n\n\"I have power to exorcise spirits,\" said Gerard, trembling. \"I will\nventure forth.\"\n\n\"Go alone then,\" said Martin; \"I have looked on't once, and live.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nThe strange glance of hatred the burgomaster had cast on Gerard, coupled\nwith his imprisonment, had filled the young man with a persuasion that\nGhysbrecht was his enemy to the death, and he glided round the angle of\nthe tower, fully expecting to see no supernatural appearance, but some\ncruel and treacherous contrivance of a bad man to do him a mischief in\nthat prison, his escape from which could hardly be known.\n\nAs he stole forth, a soft but brave hand crept into his; and Margaret\nwas by his side, to share this new peril.\n\nNo sooner was the haunted tower visible, than a sight struck their eyes\nthat benumbed them as they stood. More than halfway up the tower, a\ncreature with a fiery head, like an enormous glowworm, was steadily\nmounting the wall: the body was dark, but its outline visible through\nthe glare from the head, and the whole creature not much less than four\nfeet long.\n\nAt the foot of the tower stood a thing in white, that looked exactly\nlike the figure of a female. Gerard and Margaret palpitated with awe.\n\n\"The rope! the rope! It is going up the rope,\" gasped Gerard.\n\nAs they gazed, the glowworm disappeared in Gerard's late prison, but\nits light illuminated the cell inside and reddened the window. The white\nfigure stood motionless below.\n\nSuch as can retain their senses after the first prostrating effect of\nthe supernatural are apt to experience terror in one of its strangest\nforms, a wild desire to fling themselves upon the terrible object. It\nfascinates them as the snake the bird. The great tragedian Macready\nused to render this finely in Macbeth, at Banquo's second appearance.\nHe flung himself with averted head at the horrible shadow. This strange\nimpulse now seized Margaret. She put down Gerard's hand quietly, and\nstood bewildered; then, all in a moment, with a wild cry, darted towards\nthe spectre. Gerard, not aware of the natural impulse I have spoken of,\nnever doubted the evil one was drawing her to her perdition. He fell on\nhis knees.\n\n\"Exorcizo vos. In nomine beatae Mariae, exorcizo vos.\"\n\nWhile the exorcist was shrieking his incantations in extremity of\nterror, to his infinite relief he heard the spectre utter a feeble\ncry of fear. To find that hell had also its little weaknesses was\nencouraging. He redoubled his exorcisms, and presently he saw the\nghastly shape kneeling at Margaret's knees, and heard it praying\npiteously for mercy.\n\n\nKate and Giles soon reached the haunted tower. Judge their surprise when\nthey found a new rope dangling from the prisoner's window to the ground.\n\n\"I see how it is,\" said the inferior intelligence, taking facts as they\ncame. \"Our Gerard has come down this rope. He has got clear. Up I go,\nand see.\"\n\n\"No, Giles, no!\" said the superior intelligence, blinded by prejudice.\n\"See you not this is glamour? This rope is a line the evil one casts out\nto wile thee to destruction. He knows the weaknesses of all our hearts;\nhe has seen how fond you are of going up things. Where should our Gerard\nprocure a rope? how fasten it in the sky like this? It is not in nature.\nHoly saints protect us this night, for hell is abroad.\"\n\n\"Stuff!\" said the dwarf; \"the way to hell is down, and this rope leads\nup. I never had the luck to go up such a long rope. It may be years ere\nI fall in with such a long rope all ready for me. As well be knocked on\nthe head at once as never know happiness.\"\n\nAnd he sprung on to the rope with a cry of delight, as a cat jumps with\na mew on to a table where fish is. All the gymnast was on fire; and the\nonly concession Kate could gain from him was permission to fasten the\nlantern on his neck first.\n\n\"A light scares the ill spirits,\" said she.\n\nAnd so, with his huge arms, and his legs like feathers, Giles went up\nthe rope faster than his brother came down it. The light at the nape of\nhis neck made a glowworm of him. His sister watched his progress, with\ntrembling anxiety. Suddenly a female figure started out of the solid\nmasonry, and came flying at her with more than mortal velocity.\n\nKate uttered a feeble cry. It was all she could, for her tongue clove to\nher palate with terror. Then she dropped her crutches, and sank upon her\nknees, hiding her face and moaning:\n\n\"Take my body, but spare my soul!\"\n\nMargaret (panting). \"Why, it is a woman!\"\n\nKate (quivering). \"Why, it is a woman!\"\n\nMargaret. \"How you scared me!\"\n\nKate. \"I am scared enough myself. Oh! oh! oh!\"\n\n\"This is strange! But the fiery-headed thing? Yet it was with you, and\nyou are harmless! But why are you here at this time of night?\"\n\n\"Nay, why are YOU?\"\n\n\"Perhaps we are on the same errand? Ah! you are his good sister, Kate!\"\n\n\"And you are Margaret Brandt.\"\n\n\"Yes.\n\n\"All the better. You love him; you are here. Then Giles was right. He\nhas won free.\"\n\nGerard came forward, and put the question at rest. But all further\nexplanation was cut short by a horrible unearthly noise, like a\nsepulchre ventriloquizing:\n\n\"PARCHMENT!--PARCHMENT!--PARCHMENT!\"\n\nAt each repetition, it rose in intensity. They looked up, and there was\nthe dwarf, with his hands full of parchments, and his face lighted with\nfiendish joy and lurid with diabolical fire. The light being at his\nneck, a more infernal \"transparency\" never startled mortal eye. With the\nword, the awful imp hurled parchment at the astonished heads below.\nDown came records, like wounded wild-ducks; some collapsed, others\nfluttering, and others spread out and wheeling slowly down in airy\ncircles. They had hardly settled, when again the sepulchral roar was\nheard--\"Parchment--parchment!\" and down pattered and sailed another\nflock of documents: another followed: they whitened the grass. Finally,\nthe fire-headed imp, with his light body and horny hands, slid down the\nrope like a falling star, and (business before sentiment) proposed to\nhis rescued brother an immediate settlement for the merchandise he had\njust delivered.\n\n\"Hush!\" said Gerard; \"you speak too loud. Gather them up, and follow us\nto a safer place than this.\"\n\n\"Will you come home with me, Gerard?\" said little Kate.\n\n\"I have no home.\"\n\n\"You shall not say so. Who is more welcome than you will be, after this\ncruel wrong, to your father's house?\n\n\"Father! I have no father,\" said Gerard sternly. \"He that was my father\nis turned my gaoler. I have escaped from his hands; I will never come\nwithin their reach again.\"\n\n\"An enemy did this, and not our father.\"\n\nAnd she told him what she had overheard Cornelis and Sybrandt say. But\nthe injury was too recent to be soothed. Gerard showed a bitterness of\nindignation he had hitherto seemed incapable of.\n\n\"Cornelis and Sybrandt are two ill curs that have shown me their teeth\nand their heart a long while; but they could do no more. My father it is\nthat gave the burgomaster authority, or he durst not have laid a finger\non me, that am a free burgher of this town. So be it, then. I was his\nson. I am his prisoner. He has played his part. I shall play mine.\nFarewell the burgh where I was born, and lived honestly and was put in\nprison. While there is another town left in creation, I'll never trouble\nyou again, Tergou.\"\n\n\"Oh! Gerard! Gerard!\"\n\nMargaret whispered her: \"Do not gainsay him now. Give his choler time to\ncool!\"\n\nKate turned quickly towards her. \"Let me look at your face?\" The\ninspection was favourable, it seemed, for she whispered: \"It is a comely\nface, and no mischief-maker's.\"\n\n\"Fear me not,\" said Margaret, in the same tone. \"I could not be happy\nwithout your love, as well as Gerard's.\"\n\n\"These are comfortable words,\" sobbed Kate. Then, looking up, she said,\n\"I little thought to like you so well. My heart is willing, but my\ninfirmity will not let me embrace you.\"\n\nAt this hint, Margaret wound gently round Gerard's sister, and kissed\nher lovingly.\n\n\"Often he has spoken of you to me, Kate; and often I longed for this.\"\n\n\"You, too, Gerard,\" said Kate; \"kiss me ere you go; for my heart lies\nheavy at parting with you this night.\"\n\nGerard kissed her, and she went on her crutches home. The last thing\nthey heard of her was a little patient sigh. Then the tears came and\nstood thick in Margaret's eyes. But Gerard was a man, and noticed not\nhis sister's sigh.\n\nAs they turned to go to Sevenbergen, the dwarf nudged Gerard with his\nbundle of parchments and held out a concave claw.\n\nMargaret dissuaded Gerard. \"Why take what is not ours?\"\n\n\"Oh, spoil an enemy how you can.\"\n\n\"But may they not make this a handle for fresh violence?\"\n\n\"How can they? Think you I shall stay in Tergou after this? The\nburgomaster robbed me of my liberty; I doubt I should take his life for\nit, if I could.\"\n\n\"Oh, fie! Gerard.\"\n\n\"What! Is life worth more than liberty? Well, I can't take his life, so\nI take the first thing that comes to hand.\"\n\nHe gave Giles a few small coins, with which the urchin was gladdened,\nand shuffled after his sister. Margaret and Gerard were speedily joined\nby Martin, and away to Sevenbergen.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nGhysbrecht Van Swieten kept the key of Gerard's prison in his pouch. He\nwaited till ten of the clock ere he visited for he said to himself, \"A\nlittle hunger sometimes does well it breaks 'em.\" At ten he crept up\nthe stairs with a loaf and pitcher, followed by his trusty servant well\narmed. Ghysbrecht listened at the door. There was no sound inside.\nA grim smile stole over his features. \"By this time he will be as\ndown-hearted as Albert Koestein was,\" thought he. He opened the door.\n\nNo Gerard.\n\nGhysbrecht stood stupefied.\n\nAlthough his face was not visible, his body seemed to lose all motion\nin so peculiar a way, and then after a little he fell trembling so, that\nthe servant behind him saw there was something amiss, and crept close\nto him and peeped over his shoulder. At sight of the empty cell, and\nthe rope, and iron bar, he uttered a loud exclamation of wonder; but his\nsurprise doubled when his master, disregarding all else, suddenly flung\nhimself on his knees before the empty chest, and felt wildly all over it\nwith quivering hands, as if unwilling to trust his eyes in a matter so\nimportant.\n\nThe servant gazed at him in utter bewilderment.\n\n\"Why, master, what is the matter?\"\n\nGhysbrecht's pale lips worked as if he was going to answer; but they\nuttered no sound: his hands fell by his side, and he stared into the\nchest.\n\n\"Why, master, what avails glaring into that empty box? The lad is not\nthere. See here! note the cunning of the young rogue; he hath taken out\nthe bar, and--\"\n\n\"GONE! GONE! GONE!\"\n\n\"Gone! What is gone, Holy saints! he is planet-struck!\"\n\n\"STOP THIEF!\" shrieked Ghysbrecht, and suddenly turned, on his servant\nand collared him, and shook him with rage. \"D'ye stand there, knave, and\nsee your master robbed? Run! fly! A hundred crowns to him that finds\nit me again. No, no! 'tis in vain. Oh, fool! fool! to leave that in the\nsame room with him. But none ever found the secret spring before. None\never would but he. It was to be. It is to be. Lost! lost!\" and his years\nand infirmity now gained the better of his short-lived frenzy, and he\nsank on the chest muttering \"Lost! lost!\"\n\n\"What is lost, master?\" asked the servant kindly.\n\n\"House and lands and good name,\" groaned Ghysbrecht, and wrung his hands\nfeebly.\n\n\"WHAT?\" cried the servant.\n\nThis emphatic word, and the tone of eager curiosity, struck on\nGhysbrecht's ear and revived his natural cunning.\n\n\"I have lost the town records,\" stammered he, and he looked askant at\nthe man like a fox caught near a hen-roost.\n\n\"Oh, is that all?\"\n\n\"Is't not enough? What will the burghers say to me? What will the burghs\ndo?\" Then he suddenly burst out again, \"A hundred crowns to him who\nshall recover them; all, mind, all that were in this box. If one be\nmissing, I give nothing.\"\n\n\"'Tis a bargain, master: the hundred crowns are in my pouch. See you not\nthat where Gerard Eliassoen is, there are the pieces of sheepskin you\nrate so high?\"\n\n\"That is true; that is true, good Dierich: good faithful Dierich. All,\nmind, all that were in the chest.\"\n\n\"Master, I will take the constables to Gerard's house, and seize him for\nthe theft.\"\n\n\"The theft? ay! good; very good. It is theft. I forgot that. So, as he\nis a thief now, we will put him in the dungeons below, where the toads\nare and the rats. Dierich, that man must never see daylight again. 'Tis\nhis own fault; he must be prying. Quick, quick! ere he has time to talk,\nyou know, time to talk.\"\n\nIn less than half an hour Dierich Brower and four constables entered\nthe hosier's house, and demanded young Gerard of the panic-stricken\nCatherine.\n\n\"Alas! what has he done now?\" cried she; \"that boy will break my heart.\"\n\n\"Nay, dame, but a trick of youth,\" said Dierich. \"He hath but made\noff with certain skins of parchment, in a frolic doubtless but the\nburgomaster is answerable to the burgh for their safe keeping, so he is\nin care about them; as for the youth, he will doubtless be quit for a\nreprimand.\"\n\nThis smooth speech completely imposed on Catherine; but her daughter\nwas more suspicious, and that suspicion was strengthened by the\ndisproportionate anger and disappointment Dierich showed the moment he\nlearned Gerard was not at home, had not been at home that night.\n\n\"Come away then,\" said he roughly. \"We are wasting time.\" He added\nvehemently, \"I'll find him if he is above ground.\"\n\nAffection sharpens the wits, and often it has made an innocent person\nmore than a match for the wily. As Dierich was going out, Kate made him\na signal she would speak with him privately. He bade his men go on, and\nwaited outside the door. She joined him.\n\n\"Hush!\" said she; \"my mother knows not. Gerard has left Tergou.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"I saw him last night.\"\n\n\"Ay! Where?\" cried Dierich eagerly.\n\n\"At the foot of the haunted tower.\"\n\n\"How did he get the rope?\"\n\n\"I know not; but this I know; my brother Gerard bade me there farewell,\nand he is many leagues from Tergou ere this. The town, you know, was\nalways unworthy of him, and when it imprisoned him, he vowed never\nto set foot in it again. Let the burgomaster be content, then. He has\nimprisoned him, and he has driven him from his birthplace and from his\nnative land. What need now to rob him and us of our good name?\"\n\nThis might at another moment have struck Dierich as good sense; but he\nwas too mortified at this escape of Gerard and the loss of a hundred\ncrowns.\n\n\"What need had he to steal?\" retorted he bitterly.\n\n\"Gerard stole not the trash; he but took it to spite the burgomaster,\nwho stole his liberty; but he shall answer to the Duke for it, he shall.\nAs for these skins of parchment you keep such a coil about, look in the\nnearest brook or stye, and 'tis odds but you find them.\"\n\n\"Think ye so, mistress?--think ye so?\" And Dierich's eyes flashed.\n\"Mayhap you know 'tis so.\"\n\n\"This I know, that Gerard is too good to steal, and too wise to load\nhimself with rubbish, going a journey.\"\n\n\"Give you good day, then,\" said Dierich sharply. \"The sheepskin you\nscorn, I value it more than the skin of any in Tergou.\"\n\nAnd he went off hastily on a false scent.\n\nKate returned into the house and drew Giles aside.\n\n\"Giles, my heart misgives me; breathe not to a soul what I say to you. I\nhave told Dirk Brower that Gerard is out of Holland, but much I doubt he\nis not a league from Tergou.\"\n\n\"Why, where is he, then?\"\n\n\"Where should he be, but with her he loves? But if so, he must not\nloiter. These be deep and dark and wicked men that seek him. Giles, I\nsee that in Dirk Brower's eye makes me tremble. Oh, why cannot I fly to\nSevenbergen and bid him away? Why am I not lusty and active like other\ngirls? God forgive me for fretting at His will; but I never felt till\nnow what it is to be lame and weak and useless. But you are strong, dear\nGiles,\" added she coaxingly; \"you are very strong.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am strong,\" thundered Perpusillus; then, catching sight of her\nmeaning, \"but I hate to go on foot,\" he added sulkily.\n\n\"Alas! alas! who will help me if you will not? Dear Giles, do you not\nlove Gerard?\"\n\n\"Yes, I like him best of the lot. I'll go to Sevenbergen on Peter\nBuyskens his mule. Ask you him, for he won't lend her me.\"\n\nKate remonstrated. The whole town would follow him. It would be known\nwhither he was gone, and Gerard be in worse danger than before.\n\nGiles parried this by promising to ride out of the town the opposite\nway, and not turn the mule's head towards Sevenbergen till he had got\nrid of the curious.\n\nKate then assented and borrowed the mule. She charged Giles with a short\nbut meaning message, and made him repeat it after her over and over,\ntill he could say it word for word.\n\nGiles started on the mule, and little Kate retired, and did the last\nthing now in her power for her beloved brother--prayed on her knees long\nand earnestly for his safety.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nGerard and Margaret went gaily to Sevenbergen in the first flush of\nrecovered liberty and successful adventure. But these soon yielded\nto sadder thoughts. Gerard was an escaped prisoner, and liable to be\nretaken and perhaps punished; and therefore he and Margaret would have\nto part for a time. Moreover, he had conceived a hatred to his native\nplace. Margaret wished him to leave the country for a while, but at\nthe thought of his going to Italy her heart fainted. Gerard, on the\ncontrary, was reconciled to leaving Margaret only by his desire to visit\nItaly, and his strong conviction that there he should earn money and\nreputation, and remove every obstacle to their marriage. He had already\ntold her all that the demoiselle Van Eyck had said to him. He repeated\nit, and reminded Margaret that the gold pieces were only given him to go\nto Italy with. The journey was clearly for Gerard's interest. He was a\ncraftsman and an artist, lost in this boorish place. In Italy they would\nknow how to value him. On this ground above all the unselfish girl gave\nher consent; but many tender tears came with it, and at that Gerard,\nyoung and loving as herself, cried bitterly with her, and often they\nasked one another what they had done, that so many different persons\nshould be their enemies, and combine, as it seemed, to part them.\n\nThey sat hand in hand till midnight, now deploring their hard fate, now\ndrawing bright and hopeful pictures of the future, in the midst of which\nMargaret's tears would suddenly flow, and then poor Gerard's eloquence\nwould die away in a sigh.\n\nThe morning found them resigned to part, but neither had the courage to\nsay when; and much I doubt whether the hour of parting ever would have\nstruck.\n\nBut about three in the afternoon, Giles, who had made a circuit of many\nmiles to avoid suspicion, rode up to the door. They both ran out to him,\neager with curiosity.\n\n\"Brother Gerard,\" cried he, in his tremendous tones, \"Kate bids you run\nfor your life. They charge you with theft; you have given them a handle.\nThink not to explain. Hope not for justice in Tergou. The parchments you\ntook, they are but a blind. She hath seen your death in the men's eyes;\na price is on your head. Fly! For Margaret's sake and all who love you,\nloiter not life away, but fly!\"\n\nIt was a thunder-clap, and left two white faces looking at one another,\nand at the terrible messenger.\n\nThen Giles, who had hitherto but uttered by rote what Catherine bade\nhim, put in a word of his own.\n\n\"All the constables were at our house after you, and so was Dirk Brower.\nKate is wise, Gerard. Best give ear to her rede, and fly!\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, Gerard,\" cried Margaret wildly. \"Fly on the instant. Ah! those\nparchments; my mind misgave me: why did I let you take them?\"\n\n\"Margaret, they are but a blind: Giles says so. No matter: the old\ncaitiff shall never see them again; I will not go till I have hidden\nhis treasure where he shall never find it.\" Gerard then, after thanking\nGiles warmly, bade him farewell, and told him to go back and tell Kate\nhe was gone. \"For I shall be gone ere you reach home,\" said he. He then\nshouted for Martin; and told him what had happened, and begged him to go\na little way towards Tergou, and watch the road.\n\n\"Ay!\" said Martin, \"and if I see Dirk Brower or any of his men, I will\nshoot an arrow into the oak-tree that is in our garden; and on that\nyou must run into the forest hard by, and meet me at the weird hunter's\nspring. Then I will guide you through the wood.\"\n\nSurprise thus provided against, Gerard breathed again. He went with\nMargaret, and while she watched the oak-tree tremblingly, fearing every\nmoment to see an arrow strike among the branches, Gerard dug a deep hole\nto bury the parchments in.\n\nHe threw them in, one by one. They were nearly all charters and records\nof the burgh; but one appeared to be a private deed between Floris\nBrandt, father of Peter, and Ghysbrecht.\n\n\"Why, this is as much yours as his,\" said Gerard. \"I will read this.\"\n\n\"Oh, not now, Gerard, not now,\" cried Margaret. \"Every moment you lose\nfills me with fear; and see, large drops of rain are beginning to fall,\nand the clouds lower.\"\n\nGerard yielded to this remonstrance; but he put the deed into his bosom,\nand threw the earth in over the others, and stamped it down. While thus\nemployed there came a flash of lightning followed by a peal of distant\nthunder, and the rain came down heavily. Margaret and Gerard ran into\nthe house, whither they were speedily followed by Martin.\n\n\"The road is clear,\" said he, \"and a heavy storm coming on.\"\n\nHis words proved true. The thunder came nearer and nearer till it\ncrashed overhead: the flashes followed one another close, like the\nstrokes of a whip, and the rain fell in torrents. Margaret hid her face\nnot to see the lightning. On this, Gerard put up the rough shutter and\nlighted a candle. The lovers consulted together, and Gerard blessed\nthe storm that gave him a few hours more with Margaret. The sun set\nunperceived, and still the thunder pealed, and the lightning flashed,\nand the rain poured. Supper was set; but Gerard and Margaret could not\neat: the thought that this was the last time they should sup together\nchoked them. The storm lulled a little. Peter retired to rest. But\nGerard was to go at peep of day, and neither he nor Margaret could\nafford to lose an hour in sleep. Martin sat a while, too; for he was\nfitting a new string to his bow, a matter in which he was very nice.\n\nThe lovers murmured their sorrows and their love beside him.\n\nSuddenly the old man held up his hand to them to be silent.\n\nThey were quiet and listened, and heard nothing. But the next moment a\nfootstep crackled faintly upon the autumn leaves that lay strewn in the\ngarden at the back door of the house. To those who had nothing to fear\nsuch a step would have said nothing; but to those who had enemies it was\nterrible. For it was a foot trying to be noiseless.\n\nMartin fitted an arrow to his string and hastily blew out the candle. At\nthis moment, to their horror, they heard more than one footstep approach\nthe other door of the cottage, not quite so noiselessly as the other,\nbut very stealthily--and then a dead pause.\n\nTheir blood froze in their veins.\n\n\"Oh, Kate, oh, Kate! You said fly on the instant.\" And Margaret moaned\nand wrung her hands in anguish and terror and wild remorse for having\nkept Gerard.\n\n\"Hush, girl!\" said Martin, in a stern whisper.\n\nA heavy knock fell on the door.\n\nAnd on the hearts within.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nAs if this had been a concerted signal, the back door was struck as\nrudely the next instant. They were hemmed in. But at these alarming\nsounds Margaret seemed to recover some share of self-possession. She\nwhispered, \"Say he was here, but is gone.\" And with this she seized\nGerard and almost dragged him up the rude steps that led to her father's\nsleeping-room. Her own lay next beyond it.\n\nThe blows on the door were repeated.\n\n\"Who knocks at this hour?\"\n\n\"Open, and you will see!\"\n\n\"I open not to thieves--honest men are all abed now.\"\n\n\"Open to the law, Martin Wittenhaagen, or you shall rue it.\"\n\n\"Why, that is Dirk Brower's voice, I trow. What make you so far from\nTergou?\"\n\n\"Open, and you will know.\"\n\nMartin drew the bolt very slowly, and in rushed Dierich and four more.\nThey let in their companion who was at the back door.\n\n\"Now, Martin, where is Gerard Eliassoen?\"\n\n\"Gerard Eliassoen? Why, he was here but now!\"\n\n\"Was here?\" Dierich's countenance fell. \"And where is he now?\"\n\n\"They say he has gone to Italy. Why, what is to do?\"\n\n\"No matter. When did he go? Tell me not that he went in such a storm as\nthis!\"\n\n\"Here is a coil about Gerard Eliassoen,\" said Martin contemptuously.\nThen he lighted the candle, and seating himself coolly by the fire,\nproceeded to whip some fine silk round his bow-string at the place where\nthe nick of the arrow frets it.\n\n\"I'll tell you,\" said he carelessly. \"Know you his brother Giles?--a\nlittle misbegotten imp, all head and arms? Well, he came tearing over\nhere on a mule, and bawled out something, I was too far off to hear the\ncreature's words, but only its noise. Any way, he started Gerard. For as\nsoon as he was gone, there was such crying and kissing, and then Gerard\nwent away. They do tell me he has gone to Italy--mayhap you know where\nthat is, for I don't.\"\n\nDierich's countenance fell lower and lower at this account. There was\nno flaw in it, A cunninger man than Martin would perhaps have told a\nlie too many and raised suspicion. But Martin did his task well. He only\ntold the one falsehood he was bade to tell, and of his own head invented\nnothing.\n\n\"Mates,\" said Dierich, \"I doubt he speaks sooth. I told the burgomaster\nhow 'twould be. He met the dwarf galloping Peter Buyskens's mule from\nSevenbergen. 'They have sent that imp to Gerard,' says he, 'so, then,\nGerard is at Sevenbergen.' 'Ah, master!' says I, ''tis too late now. We\nshould have thought of Sevenbergen before, instead of wasting our time\nhunting all the odd corners of Tergou for those cursed parchments that\nwe shall never find till we find the man that took 'em. If he was at\nSevenbergen,' quoth I, 'and they sent the dwarf to him, it must have\nbeen to warn him we are after him. He is leagues away by now,' quoth I.\nConfound that chalk-faced girl! she has outwitted us bearded men; and\nso I told the burgomaster, but he would not hear reason. A wet jerkin\napiece, that is all we shall get, mates, by this job.\"\n\nMartin grinned coolly in Dierich's face.\n\n\"However,\" added the latter, \"to content the burgomaster, we will search\nthe house.\"\n\nMartin turned grave directly.\n\nThis change of countenance did not escape Dierich. He reflected a\nmoment.\n\n\"Watch outside two of you, one on each side of the house, that no one\njump from the upper windows. The rest come with me.\"\n\nAnd he took the candle and mounted the stairs, followed by three of his\ncomrades.\n\nMartin was left alone.\n\nThe stout soldier hung his head. All had gone so well at first; and now\nthis fatal turn! Suddenly it occurred to him that all was not yet lost.\nGerard must be either in Peter's room or Margaret's; they were not so\nvery high from the ground. Gerard would leap out. Dierich had left a man\nbelow; but what then? For half a minute Gerard and he would be two to\none, and in that brief space, what might not be done?\n\nMartin then held the back door ajar and watched. The light shone in\nPeter's room. \"Curse the fool!\" said he, \"is he going to let them take\nhim like a girl?\"\n\nThe light now passed into Margaret's bedroom. Still no window was\nopened. Had Gerard intended to escape that way, he would not have waited\ntill the men were in the room. Martin saw that at once, and left the\ndoor, and came to the foot-stair and listened.\n\nHe began to think Gerard must have escaped by the window while all the\nmen were in the house. The longer the silence continued, the stronger\ngrew this conviction. But it was suddenly and rudely dissipated.\n\nFaint cries issued from the inner bedroom--Margaret's.\n\n\"They have taken him,\" groaned Martin; \"they have got him.\"\n\nIt now flashed across Martin's mind that if they took Gerard away, his\nlife was not worth a button; and that, if evil befell him, Margaret's\nheart would break. He cast his eyes wildly round like some savage beast\nseeking an escape, and in a twinkling formed a resolution terribly\ncharacteristic of those iron times and of a soldier driven to bay. He\nstepped to each door in turn, and imitating Dierich Brower's voice,\nsaid sharply, \"Watch the window!\" He then quietly closed and bolted\nboth doors. He then took up his bow and six arrows; one he fitted to his\nstring, the others he put into his quiver. His knife he placed upon a\nchair behind him, the hilt towards him; and there he waited at the foot\nof the stair with the calm determination to slay those four men, or be\nslain by them. Two, he knew, he could dispose of by his arrows, ere\nthey could get near him, and Gerard and he must take their chance\nhand-to-hand with the remaining pair. Besides, he had seen men\npanic-stricken by a sudden attack of this sort. Should Brower and his\nmen hesitate but an instant before closing with him, he should shoot\nthree instead of two, and then the odds would be on the right side.\n\nHe had not long to wait. The heavy steps sounded in Margaret's room, and\ncame nearer and nearer.\n\nThe light also approached, and voices.\n\nMartin's heart, stout as it was, beat hard, to hear men coming thus to\ntheir death, and perhaps to his; more likely so than not: for four is\nlong odds in a battlefield of ten feet square, and Gerard might be bound\nperhaps, and powerless to help. But this man, whom we have seen shake in\nhis shoes at a Giles-o'-lanthorn, never wavered in this awful moment of\nreal danger, but stood there, his body all braced for combat, and his\neye glowing, equally ready to take life and lose it. Desperate game! to\nwin which was exile instant and for life, and to lose it was to die that\nmoment upon that floor he stood on.\n\n\nDierich Brower and his men found Peter in his first sleep. They opened\nhis cupboards, they ran their knives into an alligator he had nailed to\nhis wall; they looked under his bed: it was a large room, and apparently\nfull of hiding-places, but they found no Gerard.\n\nThen they went on to Margaret's room, and the very sight of it was\ndiscouraging--it was small and bare, and not a cupboard in it; there\nwas, however, a large fireplace and chimney. Dierich's eye fell on these\ndirectly. Here they found the beauty of Sevenbergen sleeping on an old\nchest not a foot high, and no attempt made to cover it; but the sheets\nwere snowy white, and so was Margaret's own linen. And there she lay,\nlooking like a lily fallen into a rut.\n\nPresently she awoke, and sat up in the bed, like one amazed; then,\nseeing the men, began to scream faintly, and pray for mercy.\n\nShe made Dierich Brower ashamed of his errand.\n\n\"Here is a to-do,\" said he, a little confused. \"We are not going to hurt\nyou, my pretty maid. Lie you still, and shut your eyes, and think of\nyour wedding-night, while I look up this chimney to see if Master Gerard\nis there.\"\n\n\"Gerard! in my room?\"\n\n\"Why not? They say that you and he--\"\n\n\"Cruel! you know they have driven him away from me--driven him from his\nnative place. This is a blind. You are thieves; you are wicked men; you\nare not men of Sevenbergen, or you would know Margaret Brandt better\nthan to look for her lover in this room of all others in the world. Oh,\nbrave! Four great hulking men to come, armed to the teeth, to insult one\npoor honest girl! The women that live in your own houses must be naught,\nor you would respect them too much to insult a girl of good character.\"\n\n\"There! come away, before we hear worse,\" said Dierich hastily. \"He\nis not in the chimney. Plaster will mend what a cudgel breaks; but a\nwoman's tongue is a double-edged dagger, and a girl is a woman with her\nmother's milk still in her.\" And he beat a hasty retreat. \"I told the\nburgomaster how 'twould be.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nWhere is the woman that cannot act a part? Where is she who will not\ndo it, and do it well, to save the man she loves? Nature on these great\noccasions comes to the aid of the simplest of the sex, and teaches her\nto throw dust in Solomon's eyes. The men had no sooner retired than\nMargaret stepped out of bed, and opened the long chest on which she had\nbeen lying down in her skirt and petticoat and stockings, and nightdress\nover all; and put the lid, bed-clothes and all, against the wall: then\nglided to the door and listened. The footsteps died away through her\nfather's room and down the stairs.\n\nNow in that chest there was a peculiarity that it was almost impossible\nfor a stranger to detect. A part of the boarding of the room had been\nbroken, and Gerard being applied to to make it look neater, and being\nshort of materials, had ingeniously sawed away a space sufficient just\nto admit Margaret's soi-disant bed, and with the materials thus acquired\nhe had repaired the whole room. As for the bed or chest, it really\nrested on the rafters a foot below the boards. Consequently it was full\ntwo feet deep, though it looked scarce one.\n\nAll was quiet. Margaret kneeled and gave thanks to Heaven. Then she\nglided from the door and leaned over the chest, and whispered tenderly,\n\"Gerard!\"\n\nGerard did not reply.\n\nShe then whispered a little louder, \"Gerard, all is safe, thank Heaven!\nYou may rise; but oh! be cautious!\"\n\nGerard made no reply.\n\nShe laid her hand upon his shoulder--\"Gerard!\"\n\nNo reply.\n\n\"Oh, what is this?\" she cried, and her hands ran wildly over his face\nand his bosom. She took him by the shoulders; she shook him; she lifted\nhim; but he escaped from her trembling hands, and fell back, not like a\nman, but like a body. A great dread fell on her. The lid had been down.\nShe had lain upon it. The men had been some time in the room. With all\nthe strength of frenzy she tore him out of the chest. She bore him in\nher arms to the window. She dashed the window open. The sweet air came\nin. She laid him in it and in the moonlight. His face was the colour of\nashes; his body was all limp and motionless. She felt his heart. Horror!\nit was as still as the rest! Horror of horrors! she had stifled him with\nher own body.\n\nThe mind cannot all at once believe so great and sudden and strange a\ncalamity. Gerard, who had got alive into that chest scarce five minutes\nago, how could he be dead?\n\nShe called him by all the endearing names that heart could think or\ntongue could frame. She kissed him and fondled him and coaxed him and\nimplored him to speak to her.\n\nNo answer to words of love, such as she had never uttered to him before,\nnor thought she could utter. Then the poor creature, trembling all over,\nbegan to say over that ashy face little foolish things that were at once\nterrible and pitiable.\n\n\"Oh, Gerard! I am very sorry you are dead. I am very sorry I have killed\nyou. Forgive me for not letting the men take you; it would have been\nbetter than this. Oh, Gerard! I am very, very sorry for what I have\ndone.\" Then she began suddenly to rave.\n\n\"No! no! such things can't be, or there is no God. It is monstrous. How\ncan my Gerard be dead? How can I have killed my Gerard? I love him. Oh,\nGod! you know how I love him. He does not. I never told him. If he knew\nmy heart, he would speak to me, he would not be so deaf to his poor\nMargaret. It is all a trick to make me cry out and betray him; but no!\nI love him too well for that. I'll choke first.\" And she seized her own\nthroat, to check her wild desire to scream in her terror and anguish.\n\n\"If he would but say one word. Oh, Gerard! don't die without a word.\nHave mercy on me and scold me, but speak to me: if you are angry with\nme, scold me! curse me! I deserve it: the idiot that killed the man she\nloved better than herself. Ah I am a murderess. The worst in all the\nworld. Help! help! I have murdered him. Ah! ah! ah! ah! ah!\"\n\nShe tore her hair, and uttered shriek after shriek, so wild, so\npiercing, they fell like a knell upon the ears of Dierich Brower and his\nmen. All started to their feet and looked at one another.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nMartin Wittenhaagen, standing at the foot of the stairs with his arrow\ndrawn nearly to the head and his knife behind him, was struck with\namazement to see the men come back without Gerard: he lowered his bow\nand looked open-mouthed at them. They, for their part, were equally\npuzzled at the attitude they had caught him in.\n\n\"Why, mates, was the old fellow making ready to shoot at us?\"\n\n\"Stuff!\" said Martin, recovering his stolid composure; \"I was but trying\nmy new string. There! I'll unstring my bow, if you think that.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" said Dierich suspiciously, \"there is something more in you than\nI understand: put a log on, and let us dry our hides a bit ere we go.\"\n\nA blazing fire was soon made, and the men gathered round it, and their\nclothes and long hair were soon smoking from the cheerful blaze. Then it\nwas that the shrieks were heard in Margaret's room. They all started up,\nand one of them seized the candle and ran up the steps that led to the\nbedrooms.\n\nMartin rose hastily too, and being confused by these sudden screams, and\napprehending danger from the man's curiosity, tried to prevent him from\ngoing there.\n\nAt this Dierich threw his arms round him from behind, and called on the\nothers to keep him. The man that had the candle got clear away, and all\nthe rest fell upon Martin, and after a long and fierce struggle, in the\ncourse of which they were more than once all rolling on the floor, with\nMartin in the middle, they succeeded in mastering the old Samson, and\nbinding him hand and foot with a rope they had brought for Gerard.\n\nMartin groaned aloud. He saw the man had made his way to Margaret's room\nduring the struggle, and here was he powerless.\n\n\"Ay, grind your teeth, you old rogue,\" said Dierich, panting with the\nstruggle. \"You shan't use them.\"\n\n\"It is my belief, mates, that our lives were scarce safe while this old\nfellow's bones were free.\"\n\n\"He makes me think this Gerard is not far off,\" put in another.\n\n\"No such luck,\" replied Dierich. \"Hallo, mates. Jorian Ketel is a long\ntime in that girl's bedroom. Best go and see after him, some of us.\"\n\nThe rude laugh caused by this remark had hardly subsided, when hasty\nfootsteps were heard running along over head.\n\n\"Oh, here he comes, at last. Well, Jorian, what is to do now up there?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nJorian Ketel went straight to Margaret's room, and there, to his\ninfinite surprise, he found the man he had been in search of, pale and\nmotionless, his head in Margaret's lap, and she kneeling over him, mute\nnow, and stricken to stone. Her eyes were dilated yet glazed, and she\nneither saw the light nor heard the man, nor cared for anything on\nearth, but the white face in her lap.\n\nJorian stood awe-struck, the candle shaking in his hand.\n\n\"Why, where was he, then, all the time?\"\n\nMargaret heeded him not. Jorian went to the empty chest and inspected\nit. He began to comprehend. The girl's dumb and frozen despair moved\nhim.\n\n\"This is a sorry sight,\" said he; \"it is a black night's work: all for\na few skins! Better have gone with us than so. She is past answering me,\npoor wench. Stop! let us try whether--\"\n\nHe took down a little round mirror, no bigger than his hand, and put it\nto Gerard's mouth and nostrils, and held it there. When he withdrew it,\nit was dull.\n\n\"THERE IS LIFE IN HIM!\" said Jorian Ketel to himself.\n\nMargaret caught the words instantly, though only muttered, and it was if\na statue should start into life and passion. She rose and flung her arms\nround Jorian's neck.\n\n\"Oh, bless the tongue that tells me so!\" and she clasped the great rough\nfellow again and again, eagerly, almost fiercely.\n\n\"There, there! let us lay him warm, said Jorian; and in a moment he\nraised Gerard and laid him on the bed-clothes. Then he took out a flask\nhe carried, and filled his hand twice with Schiedamze, and flung it\nsharply each time in Gerard's face. The pungent liquor co-operated with\nhis recovery--he gave a faint sigh. Oh, never was sound so joyful to\nhuman ear! She flew towards him, but then stopped, quivering for fear\nshe should hurt him. She had lost all confidence in herself.\n\n\"That is right--let him alone,\" said Jorian; \"don't go cuddling him as\nyou did me, or you'll drive his breath back again. Let him alone: he is\nsure to come to. 'Tisn't like as if he was an old man.\"\n\nGerard sighed deeply, and a faint streak of colour stole to his lips.\nJorian made for the door. He had hardly reached it, when he found his\nlegs seized from behind.\n\nIt was Margaret! She curled round his knees like a serpent, and kissed\nhis hand, and fawned on him. \"You won't tell? You have saved his life;\nyou have not the heart to thrust him back into his grave, to undo your\nown good work?\"\n\n\"No, no! It is not the first time I have done you two a good turn; 'twas\nI told you in the church whither we had to take him. Besides, what is\nDierich Brower to me? I'll see him hanged ere I'll tell him. But I\nwish you'd tell me where the parchments are! There are a hundred crowns\noffered for them. That would be a good windfall for my Joan and the\nchildren, you know.\"\n\n\"Ah! they shall have those hundred crowns.\n\n\"What! are the things in the house?\" asked Jorian eagerly.\n\n\"No; but I know where they are; and by God and St. Bavon I swear you\nshall have them to-morrow. Come to me for them when you will, but come\nalone.\"\n\n\"I were made else. What! share the hundred crowns with Dirk Brower? And\nnow may my bones rot in my skin if I let a soul know the poor boy is\nhere.\"\n\nHe then ran off, lest by staying longer he should excite suspicion,\nand have them all after him. And Margaret knelt, quivering from head to\nfoot, and prayed beside Gerard and for Gerard.\n\n\n\"What is to do?\" replied Jorian to Dierich Brower's query; \"why, we have\nscared the girl out of her wits. She was in a kind of fit.\"\n\n\"We had better all go and doctor her, then.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes! and frighten her into the churchyard. Her father is a doctor,\nand I have roused him, and set him to bring her round. Let us see the\nfire, will ye?\"\n\nHis off-hand way disarmed all suspicion. And soon after the party agreed\nthat the kitchen of the \"Three Kings\" was much warmer than Peter's\nhouse, and they departed, having first untied Martin.\n\n\"Take note, mate, that I was right, and the burgomaster wrong,\" said\nDierich Brower at the door; \"I said we should be too late to catch him,\nand we were too late.\"\n\n\nThus Gerard, in one terrible night, grazed the prison and the grave.\n\nAnd how did he get clear at last? Not by his cunningly contrived\nhiding-place, nor by Margaret's ready wit; but by a good impulse in\none of his captors, by the bit of humanity left in a somewhat reckless\nfellow's heart, aided by his desire of gain. So mixed and seemingly\nincongruous are human motives, so shortsighted our shrewdest counsels.\n\nThey whose moderate natures or gentle fates keep them, in life's\npassage, from the fierce extremes of joy and anguish our nature is\ncapable of, are perhaps the best, and certainly the happiest of\nmankind. But to such readers I should try in vain to convey what bliss\nunspeakable settled now upon these persecuted lovers, Even to those who\nhave joyed greatly and greatly suffered, my feeble art can present but a\npale reflection of Margaret's and Gerard's ecstasy.\n\nTo sit and see a beloved face come back from the grave to the world, to\nhealth and beauty, by swift gradations; to see the roses return to the\nloved cheek, love's glance to the loved eye, and his words to the loved\nmouth--this was Margaret's--a joy to balance years of sorrow. It\nwas Gerard's to awake from a trance, and find his head pillowed on\nMargaret's arm; to hear the woman he adored murmur new words of eloquent\nlove, and shower tears and tender kisses and caresses on him. He never\nknew, till this sweet moment, how ardently, how tenderly, she loved\nhim. He thanked his enemies. They wreathed their arms sweetly round each\nother, and trouble and danger seemed a world, an age behind them. They\ncalled each other husband and wife. Were they not solemnly betrothed?\nAnd had they not stood before the altar together? Was not the blessing\nof Holy Church upon their union?--her curse on all who would part them?\n\nBut as no woman's nerves can bear with impunity so terrible a strain.\npresently Margaret turned faint, and sank on Gerard's shoulder, smiling\nfeebly, but quite, quite unstrung. Then Gerard was anxious, and would\nseek assistance. But she held him with a gentle grasp, and implored him\nnot to leave her for a moment.\n\n\"While I can lay my hand on you, I feel you are safe, not else. Foolish\nGerard! nothing ails me. I am weak, dearest, but happy, oh! so happy!\"\n\nThen it was Gerard's turn to support that dear head, with its great\nwaves of hair flowing loose over him, and nurse her, and soothe her,\nquivering on his bosom, with soft encouraging words and murmurs of love,\nand gentle caresses. Sweetest of all her charms is a woman's weakness to\na manly heart.\n\nPoor things! they were happy. To-morrow they must part. But that was\nnothing to them now. They had seen Death, and all other troubles seemed\nlight as air. While there is life there is hope; while there is hope\nthere is joy. Separation for a year or two, what was it to them, who\nwere so young, and had caught a glimpse of the grave? The future was\nbright, the present was Heaven: so passed the blissful hours.\n\nAlas! their innocence ran other risks besides the prison and the grave.\nThey were in most danger from their own hearts and their inexperience,\nnow that visible danger there was none.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nGhysbrecht Van Swieten could not sleep all night for anxiety. He was\nafraid of thunder and lightning, or he would have made one of the party\nthat searched Peter's house. As soon as the storm ceased altogether,\nhe crept downstairs, saddled his mule, and rode to the \"Three Kings\" at\nSevenbergen. There he found his men sleeping, some on the chairs, some\non the tables, some on the floor. He roused them furiously, and heard\nthe story of their unsuccessful search, interlarded with praises of\ntheir zeal.\n\n\"Fool! to let you go without me,\" cried the burgomaster. \"My life on't\nhe was there all the time. Looked ye under the girl's bed?\"\n\n\"No; there was no room for a man there.\"\n\n\"How know ye that, if ye looked not?\" snarled Ghysbrecht. \"Ye should\nhave looked under her bed, and in it too, and sounded all the panels\nwith your knives. Come, now, get up, and I shall show ye how to search.\"\n\nDierich Brower got up and shook himself. \"If you find him, call me a\nhorse and no man.\"\n\nIn a few minutes Peter's house was again surrounded.\n\nThe fiery old man left his mule in the hands of Jorian Ketel, and, with\nDierich Brower and the others, entered the house.\n\nThe house was empty.\n\nNot a creature to be seen, not even Peter. They went upstairs, and\nthen suddenly one of the men gave a shout, and pointed through Peter's\nwindow, which was open. The others looked, and there, at some little\ndistance, walking quietly across the fields with Margaret and Martin,\nwas the man they sought. Ghysbrecht, with an exulting yell, descended\nthe stairs and flung himself on his mule; and he and his men set off in\nhot pursuit.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nGerard warned by recent peril, rose before daybreak and waked Martin.\nThe old soldier was astonished. He thought Gerard had escaped by the\nwindow last night. Being consulted as to the best way for him to leave\nthe country and elude pursuit, he said there was but one road safe. \"I\nmust guide you through the great forest to a bridle-road I know of. This\nwill take you speedily to a hostelry, where they will lend you a swift\nhorse; and then a day's gallop will take you out of Holland. But let us\nstart ere the folk here quit their beds.\"\n\nPeter's house was but a furlong and a half from the forest. They\nstarted, Martin with his bow and three arrows, for it was Thursday;\nGerard with nothing but a stout oak staff Peter gave him for the\njourney.\n\nMargaret pinned up her kirtle and farthingale, for the road was wet.\nPeter went as far as his garden hedge with them, and then with more\nemotion than he often bestowed on passing events, gave the young man his\nblessing.\n\nThe sun was peeping above the horizon as they crossed the stony field\nand made for the wood. They had crossed about half, when Margaret, who\nkept nervously looking back every now and then, uttered a cry, and,\nfollowing her instinct, began to run towards the wood, screaming with\nterror all the way.\n\nGhysbrecht and his men were in hot pursuit.\n\nResistance would have been madness. Martin and Gerard followed\nMargaret's example. The pursuers gained slightly on them; but Martin\nkept shouting, \"Only win the wood! only win the wood!\"\n\nThey had too good a start for the men on foot, and their hearts bounded\nwith hope at Martin's words, for the great trees seemed now to stretch\ntheir branches like friendly arms towards them, and their leaves like a\nscreen.\n\nBut an unforeseen danger attacked them. The fiery old burgomaster flung\nhimself on his mule, and, spurring him to a gallop, he headed not his\nown men only, but the fugitives. His object was to cut them off. The\nold man came galloping in a semicircle, and got on the edge of the wood,\nright in front of Gerard; the others might escape for aught he cared.\n\nMargaret shrieked, and tried to protect Gerard by clasping him; but he\nshook her off without ceremony.\n\nGhysbrecht in his ardour forgot that hunted animals turn on the hunter;\nand that two men can hate, and two can long to kill the thing they hate.\n\nInstead of attempting to dodge him, as the burgomaster made sure he\nwould, Gerard flew right at him, with a savage, exulting cry, and struck\nat him with all his heart, and soul and strength. The oak staff came\ndown on Ghysbrecht's face with a frightful crash, and laid him under\nhis mule's tail beating the devil's tattoo with his heels, his face\nstreaming, and his collar spattered with blood.\n\nThe next moment the three were in the wood. The yell of dismay and\nvengeance that burst from Ghysbrecht's men at that terrible blow which\nfelled their leader, told the fugitives that it was now a race for life\nor death.\n\n\"Why run?\" cried Gerard, panting. \"You have your bow, and I have this,\"\nand he shook his bloody staff.\n\n\"Boy!\" roared Martin; \"the GALLOWS! Follow me,\" and he fled into the\nwood. Soon they heard a cry like a pack of hounds opening on sight of\nthe game. The men were in the wood, and saw them flitting amongst the\ntrees. Margaret moaned and panted as she ran; and Gerard clenched his\nteeth and grasped his staff. The next minute they came to a stiff hazel\ncoppice. Martin dashed into it, and shouldered the young wood aside as\nif it were standing corn.\n\nEre they had gone fifty yards in it they came to four blind paths.\n\nMartin took one. \"Bend low,\" said he. And, half creeping, they glided\nalong. Presently their path was again intersected with other little\ntortuous paths. They took one of them. It seemed to lead back; but\nit soon took a turn, and, after a while, brought them to a thick pine\ngrove, where the walking was good and hard. There were no paths here;\nand the young fir-trees were so thick, you could not see three yards\nbefore your nose.\n\nWhen they had gone some way in this, Martin sat down; and, having\nlearned in war to lose all impression of danger with the danger itself,\ntook a piece of bread and a slice of ham out of his wallet, and began\nquietly to eat his breakfast.\n\nThe young ones looked at him with dismay. He replied to their looks.\n\n\"All Sevenbergen could not find you now; you will lose your purse,\nGerard, long before you get to Italy; is that the way to carry a purse?\"\n\nGerard looked, and there was a large triangular purse, entangled by its\nchains to the buckle and strap of his wallet.\n\n\"This is none of mine,\" said he. \"What is in it, I wonder?\" and he\ntried to detach it; but in passing through the coppice it had become\ninextricably entangled in his strap and buckle. \"It seems loath to leave\nme,\" said Gerard, and he had to cut it loose with his knife. The purse,\non examination, proved to be well provided with silver coins of all\nsizes, but its bloated appearance was greatly owing to a number of\npieces of brown paper folded and doubled. A light burst on Gerard. \"Why,\nit must be that old thief's; and see! stuffed with paper to deceive the\nworld!\"\n\nThe wonder was how the burgomaster's purse came on Gerard.\n\nThey hit at last upon the right solution. The purse must have been\nat Ghysbrecht's saddle-bow, and Gerard rushing at his enemy, had\nunconsciously torn it away, thus felling his enemy and robbing him, with\na single gesture.\n\nGerard was delighted at this feat, but Margaret was uneasy.\n\n\"Throw it away, Gerard, or let Martin take it back. Already they call\nyou a thief. I cannot bear it.\"\n\n\"Throw it away! give it him back? not a stiver! This is spoil lawfully\nwon in battle from an enemy. Is it not, Martin?\"\n\n\"Why, of course. Send him back the brown paper, and you will; but the\npurse or the coin--that were a sin.\"\n\n\"Oh, Gerard!\" said Margaret, \"you are going to a distant land. We need\nthe goodwill of Heaven. How can we hope for that if we take what is not\nours?\"\n\nBut Gerard saw it in a different light.\n\n\"It is Heaven that gives it me by a miracle, and I shall cherish it\naccordingly,\" said this pious youth. \"Thus the favoured people spoiled\nthe Egyptians, and were blessed.\"\n\n\"Take your own way,\" said Margaret humbly; \"you are wiser than I am. You\nare my husband,\" added she, in a low murmuring voice; \"is it for me to\ngainsay you?\"\n\nThese humble words from Margaret, who, till that day, had held the\nwhip-hand, rather surprised Martin for the moment. They recurred to him\nsome time afterwards, and then they surprised him less.\n\nGerard kissed her tenderly in return for her wife-like docility, and\nthey pursued their journey hand in hand, Martin leading the way,\ninto the depths of the huge forest. The farther they went, the more\nabsolutely secure from pursuit they felt. Indeed, the townspeople never\nventured so far as this into the trackless part of the forest.\n\nImpetuous natures repent quickly. Gerard was no sooner out of all danger\nthan his conscience began to prick him.\n\n\"Martin, would I had not struck quite so hard.\"\n\n\"Whom? Oh! let that pass, he is cheap served.\"\n\n\"Martin, I saw his grey hairs as my stick fell on him. I doubt they will\nnot from my sight this while.\"\n\nMartin grunted with contempt. \"Who spares a badger for his grey hairs?\nThe greyer your enemy is, the older; and the older the craftier and the\ncraftier the better for a little killing.\"\n\n\"Killing? killing, Martin? Speak not of killing!\" and Gerard shook all\nover.\n\n\"I am much mistook if you have not,\" said Martin cheerfully.\n\n\"Now Heaven forbid!\"\n\n\"The old vagabond's skull cracked like a walnut. Aha!\"\n\n\"Heaven and the saints forbid it!\"\n\n\"He rolled off his mule like a stone shot out of a cart. Said I to\nmyself, 'There is one wiped out,'\" and the iron old soldier grinned\nruthlessly.\n\nGerard fell on his knees and began to pray for his enemy's life.\n\nAt this Martin lost his patience. \"Here's mummery. What! you that set up\nfor learning, know you not that a wise man never strikes his enemy but\nto kill him? And what is all this coil about killing of old men? If it\nhad been a young one, now, with the joys of life waiting for him, wine,\nwomen, and pillage! But an old fellow at the edge of the grave, why not\nshove him in? Go he must, to-day or to-morrow; and what better place for\ngreybeards? Now, if ever I should be so mischancy as to last so long\nas Ghysbrecht did, and have to go on a mule's legs instead of Martin\nWittenhaagen's, and a back like this (striking the wood of his bow),\ninstead of this (striking the string), I'll thank and bless any\nyoung fellow who will knock me on the head, as you have done that old\nshopkeeper; malison on his memory.\n\n\"Oh, culpa mea! culpa mea!\" cried Gerard, and smote upon his breast.\n\n\"Look there!\" cried Martin to Margaret scornfully, \"he is a priest at\nheart still--and when he is not in ire, St. Paul, what a milksop!\"\n\n\"Tush, Martin!\" cried Margaret reproachfully: then she wreathed her arms\nround Gerard, and comforted him with the double magic of a woman's sense\nand a woman's voice.\n\n\"Sweetheart!\" murmured she, \"you forget: you went not a step out of the\nway to harm him, who hunted you to your death. You fled from him. He it\nwas who spurred on you. Then did you strike; but in self-defence and\na single blow, and with that which was in your hand. Malice had drawn\nknife, or struck again and again. How often have men been smitten with\nstaves not one but many blows, yet no lives lost! If then your enemy\nhas fallen, it is through his own malice, not yours, and by the will of\nGod.\"\n\n\"Bless you, Margaret; bless you for thinking so!\"\n\n\"Yes; but, beloved one, if you have had the misfortune to kill that\nwicked man, the more need is there that you fly with haste from Holland.\nOh, let us on.\"\n\n\"Nay, Margaret,\" said Gerard. \"I fear not man's vengeance, thanks to\nMartin here and this thick wood: only Him I fear whose eye pierces the\nforest and reads the heart of man. If I but struck in self-defence,\n'tis well; but if in hate, He may bid the avenger of blood follow me to\nItaly--to Italy? ay, to earth's remotest bounds.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Martin peevishly. \"I can't hear for your chat.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Do you hear nothing, Margaret; my ears are getting old.\"\n\nMargaret listened, and presently she heard a tuneful sound, like a\nsingle stroke upon a deep ringing bell. She described it so to Martin.\n\n\"Nay, I heard it,\" said he.\n\n\"And so did I,\" said Gerard; \"it was beautiful. Ah! there it is again.\nHow sweetly it blends with the air. It is a long way off. It is before\nus, is it not?\"\n\n\"No, no! the echoes of this wood confound the ear of a stranger. It\ncomes from the pine grove.\"\n\n\"What! the one we passed?\"\n\n\"Why, Martin, is this anything? You look pale.\"\n\n\"Wonderful!\" said Martin, with a sickly sneer. \"He asks me is it\nanything? Come, on, on! at any rate, let us reach a better place than\nthis.\"\n\n\"A better place--for what?\"\n\n\"To stand at bay, Gerard,\" said Martin gravely; \"and die like soldiers,\nkilling three for one.\"\n\n\"What's that sound?\"\n\n\"IT IS THE AVENGER OF BLOOD.\"\n\n\"Oh, Martin, save him! Oh, Heaven be merciful What new mysterious peril\nis this?\"\n\n\"GIRL, IT'S A BLOODHOUND.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nThe courage, like the talent, of common men, runs in a narrow groove.\nTake them but an inch out of that, and they are done. Martin's courage\nwas perfect as far as it went. He had met and baffled many dangers in\nthe course of his rude life, and these familiar dangers he could face\nwith Spartan fortitude, almost with indifference; but he had never\nbeen hunted by a bloodhound, nor had he ever seen that brute's unerring\ninstinct baffled by human cunning. Here then a sense of the supernatural\ncombined with novelty to ungenteel his heart. After going a few steps,\nhe leaned on his bow, and energy and hope oozed out of him. Gerard, to\nwhom the danger appeared slight in proportion as it was distant, urged\nhim to flight.\n\n\"What avails it?\" said Martin sadly; \"if we get clear of the wood we\nshall die cheap; here, hard by, I know a place where we may die dear.\"\n\n\"Alas! good Martin,\" cried Gerard, \"despair not so quickly; there must\nbe some way to escape.\"\n\n\"Oh, Martin!\" cried Margaret, \"what if we were to part company? Gerard's\nlife alone is forfeit. Is there no way to draw the pursuit on us twain\nand let him go safe?\"\n\n\"Girl, you know not the bloodhound's nature. He is not on this man's\ntrack or that; he is on the track of blood. My life on't they have taken\nhim to where Ghysbrecht fell, and from the dead man's blood to the man\nthat shed it that cursed hound will lead them, though Gerard should run\nthrough an army or swim the Meuse.\" And again he leaned upon his bow,\nand his head sank.\n\nThe hound's mellow voice rang through the wood.\n\n     A cry more tunable\n     Was never halloed to, nor cheered with horn,\n     In Crete, in Sparta, or in Thessaly.\n\nStrange that things beautiful should be terrible and deadly' The eye\nof the boa-constrictor, while fascinating its prey, is lovely. No royal\ncrown holds such a jewel; it is a ruby with the emerald's green light\nplaying ever upon it. Yet the deer that sees it loses all power of\nmotion, and trembles, and awaits his death and even so, to compare\nhearing with sight, this sweet and mellow sound seemed to fascinate\nMartin Wittenhaagen. He stood uncertain, bewildered, and unnerved.\nGerard was little better now. Martin's last words had daunted him, He\nhad struck an old man and shed his blood, and, by means of that very\nblood, blood's four-footed avenger was on his track. Was not the finger\nof Heaven in this?\n\nWhilst the men were thus benumbed, the woman's brain was all activity.\nThe man she loved was in danger.\n\n\"Lend me your knife,\" said she to Martin. He gave it her.\n\n\"But 'twill be little use in your hands,\" said he.\n\nThen Margaret did a sly thing. She stepped behind Gerard, and furtively\ndrew the knife across her arm, and made it bleed freely; then stooping,\nsmeared her hose and shoes; and still as the blood trickled she smeared\nthem; but so adroitly that neither Gerard nor Martin saw. Then she\nseized the soldier's arm.\n\n\"Come, be a man!\" she said, \"and let this end. Take us to some thick\nplace, where numbers will not avail our foes.\"\n\n\"I am going,\" said Martin sulkily. \"Hurry avails not; we cannot shun the\nhound, and the place is hard by;\" then turning to the left, he led the\nway, as men go to execution.\n\nHe soon brought them to a thick hazel coppice, like the one that had\nfavoured their escape in the morning.\n\n\"There,\" said he, \"this is but a furlong broad, but it will serve our\nturn.\"\n\n\"What are we to do?\"\n\n\"Get through this, and wait on the other side; then as they come\nstraggling through, shoot three, knock two on the head, and the rest\nwill kill us.\"\n\n\"Is that all you can think of?\" said Gerard.\n\n\"That is all.\"\n\n\"Then, Martin Wittenhaagen, I take the lead, for you have lost your\nhead. Come, can you obey so young a man as I am?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, Martin,\" cried Margaret, \"do not gainsay Gerard! He is wiser\nthan his years.\"\n\nMartin yielded a sullen assent.\n\n\"Do then as you see me do,\" said Gerard; and drawing his huge knife, he\ncut at every step a hazel shoot or two close by the ground, and turning\nround twisted them breast-high behind him among the standing shoots.\nMartin did the same, but with a dogged hopeless air. When they had\nthus painfully travelled through the greater part of the coppice, the\nbloodhound's deep bay came nearer and nearer, less and less musical,\nlouder and sterner.\n\nMargaret trembled.\n\nMartin went down on his stomach and listened.\n\n\"I hear a horse's feet.\"\n\n\"No,\" said Gerard; \"I doubt it is a mule's. That cursed Ghysbrecht is\nstill alive: none other would follow me up so bitterly.\"\n\n\"Never strike your enemy but to slay him,\" said Martin gloomily.\n\n\"I'll hit harder this time, if Heaven gives me the chance,\" said Gerard.\n\nAt last they worked through the coppice, and there was an open wood. The\ntrees were large, but far apart, and no escape possible that way.\n\nAnd now with the hound's bay mingled a score of voices hooping and\nhallooing.\n\n\"The whole village is out after us,\" said Martin.\n\n\"I care not,\" said Gerard. \"Listen, Martin. I have made the track smooth\nto the dog, but rough to the men, that we may deal with them apart.\nThus the hound will gain on the men, and as soon as he comes out of the\ncoppice we must kill him.\"\n\n\"The hound? There are more than one.\"\n\n\"I hear but one.\"\n\n\"Ay! but one speaks, the others run mute; but let the leading hound lose\nthe scent, then another shall give tongue. There will be two dogs, at\nleast, or devils in dog's hides.\"\n\n\"Then we must kill two instead of one. The moment they are dead, into\nthe coppice again, and go right back.\"\n\n\"That is a good thought, Gerard,\" said Martin, plucking up heart.\n\n\"Hush! the men are in the wood.\"\n\nGerard now gave his orders in a whisper.\n\n\"Stand you with your bow by the side of the coppice--there, in the\nditch. I will go but a few yards to yon oak-tree, and hide behind it;\nthe dogs will follow me, and, as they come out, shoot as many as you\ncan, the rest will I brain as they come round the tree.\"\n\nMartin's eye flashed. They took up their places.\n\nThe hooping and hallooing came closer and closer, and soon even the\nrustling of the young wood was heard, and every now and then the\nunerring bloodhound gave a single bay.\n\nIt was terrible! the branches rustling nearer and nearer, and the\ninevitable struggle for life and death coming on minute by minute,\nand that death-knell leading it. A trembling hand was laid on Gerard's\nshoulder. It made him start violently, strung up as he was.\n\n\"Martin says if we are forced to part company, make for that high\nash-tree we came in by.\"\n\n\"Yes! yes! yes! but go back for Heaven's sake! don't come here, all out\nin the open!\"\n\nShe ran back towards Martin; but, ere she could get to him, suddenly a\nhuge dog burst out of the coppice, and stood erect a moment. Margaret\ncowered with fear, but he never noticed her. Scent was to him what sight\nis to us. He lowered his nose an instant, and the next moment, with an\nawful yell, sprang straight at Gerard's tree and rolled head-over-heels\ndead as a stone, literally spitted with an arrow from the bow that\ntwanged beside the coppice in Martin's hand. That same moment out came\nanother hound and smelt his dead comrade. Gerald rushed out at him;\nbut ere he could use his cudgel, a streak of white lightning seemed to\nstrike the hound, and he grovelled in the dust, wounded desperately, but\nnot killed, and howling piteously.\n\nGerard had not time to despatch him: the coppice rustled too near: it\nseemed alive. Pointing wildly to Martin to go back, Gerard ran a few\nyards to the right, then crept cautiously into the thick coppice just as\nthree men burst out. These had headed their comrades considerably: the\nrest were following at various distances. Gerard crawled back almost on\nall-fours. Instinct taught Martin and Margaret to do the same upon their\nline of retreat. Thus, within the distance of a few yards, the pursuers\nand pursued were passing one another upon opposite tracks.\n\nA loud cry announced the discovery of the dead and the wounded hound.\nThen followed a babble of voices, still swelling as fresh pursuers\nreached the spot. The hunters, as usual on a surprise, were wasting\ntime, and the hunted ones were making the most of it.\n\n\"I hear no more hounds,\" whispered Martin to Margaret, and he was\nhimself again.\n\nIt was Margaret's turn to tremble and despair.\n\n\"Oh, why did we part with Gerard? They will kill my Gerard, and I not\nnear him.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay! the head to catch him is not on their shoulders. You bade him\nmeet us at the ash-tree?\"\n\n\"And so I did. Bless you, Martin, for thinking of that. To the\nash-tree!\"\n\n\"Ay! but with less noise.\"\n\nThey were now nearly at the edge of the coppice, when suddenly\nthey heard hooping and hallooing behind them. The men had satisfied\nthemselves the fugitives were in the coppice, and were beating back.\n\n\"No matter,\" whispered Martin to his trembling companion. \"We shall have\ntime to win clear and slip back out of sight by hard running. Ah!\"\n\nHe stooped suddenly; for just as he was going to burst out of the\nbrushwood, his eye caught a figure keeping sentinel. It was Ghysbrecht\nVan Swieten seated on his mule; a bloody bandage was across his nose,\nthe bridge of which was broken; but over this his eyes peered keenly,\nand it was plain by their expression he had heard the fugitives rustle,\nand was looking out for them. Martin muttered a terrible oath, and\ncautiously strung his bow, then with equal caution fitted his last arrow\nto the string. Margaret put her hands to her face, but said nothing.\nShe saw this man must die or Gerard. After the first impulse she peered\nthrough her fingers, her heart panting to her throat.\n\nThe bow was raised, and the deadly arrow steadily drawn to its head,\nwhen at that moment an active figure leaped on Ghysbrecht from behind so\nswiftly, it was like a hawk swooping on a pigeon. A kerchief went over\nthe burgomaster, in a turn of the hand his head was muffled in it, and\nhe was whirled from his seat and fell heavily upon the ground, where he\nlay groaning with terror; and Gerard jumped down after him.\n\n\"Hist, Martin! Martin!\"\n\nMartin and Margaret came out, the former openmouthed crying, \"Now fly!\nfly! while they are all in the thicket; we are saved.\"\n\nAt this crisis, when safety seemed at hand, as fate would have it,\nMargaret, who had borne up so bravely till now, began to succumb, partly\nfrom loss of blood.\n\n\"Oh, my beloved, fly!\" she gasped. \"Leave me, for I am faint.\"\n\n\"No! no!\" cried Gerard. \"Death together, or safety. Ah! the mule! mount\nher, you, and I'll run by your side.\"\n\nIn a moment Martin was on Ghysbrecht's mule, and Gerard raised the\nfainting girl in his arms and placed her on the saddle, and relieved\nMartin of his bow.\n\n\"Help! treason! murder! murder!\" shrieked Ghysbrecht, suddenly rising on\nhis hams.\n\n\"Silence, cur,\" roared Gerard, and trode him down again by the throat as\nmen crush an adder.\n\n\"Now, have you got her firm? Then fly! for our lives! for our lives!\"\n\nBut even as the mule, urged suddenly by Martin's heel, scattered the\nflints with his hind hoofs ere he got into a canter, and even as Gerard\nwithdrew his foot from Ghysbrecht's throat to run, Dierich Brower and\nhis five men, who had come back for orders, and heard the burgomaster's\ncries, burst roaring out of the coppice on them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nSpeech is the familiar vent of human thoughts; but there are emotions so\nsimple and overpowering, that they rush out not in words, but eloquent\nsounds. At such moments man seems to lose his characteristics, and to\nbe merely one of the higher animals; for these, when greatly agitated,\nejaculate, though they cannot speak.\n\nThere was something terrible and truly animal, both in the roar\nof triumph with which the pursuers burst out of the thicket on our\nfugitives, and the sharp cry of terror with which these latter darted\naway. The pursuers hands clutched the empty air, scarce two feet behind\nthem, as they fled for life. Confused for a moment, like lions that miss\ntheir spring, Dierich and his men let Gerard and the mule put ten yards\nbetween them. Then they flew after with uplifted weapons. They were\nsure of catching them; for this was not the first time the parties had\nmeasured speed. In the open ground they had gained visibly on the three\nthis morning, and now, at last, it was a fair race again, to be settled\nby speed alone. A hundred yards were covered in no time. Yet still there\nremained these ten yards between the pursuers and the pursued.\n\nThis increase of speed since the morning puzzled Dierich Brower. The\nreason was this. When three run in company, the pace is that of the\nslowest of the three. From Peter's house to the edge of the forest\nGerard ran Margaret's pace; but now he ran his own; for the mule was\nfleet, and could have left them all far behind. Moreover, youth and\nchaste living began to tell. Daylight grew imperceptibly between the\nhunted ones and the hunters. Then Dierich made a desperate effort, and\ngained two yards; but in a few seconds Gerard had stolen them quietly\nback. The pursuers began to curse.\n\nMartin heard, and his face lighted up. \"Courage, Gerard! courage, brave\nlad! they are straggling.\"\n\nIt was so. Dierich was now headed by one of his men, and another dropped\ninto the rear altogether.\n\nThey came to a rising ground, not sharp, but long; and here youth, and\ngrit, and sober living told more than ever.\n\nEre he reached the top, Dierich's forty years weighed him down like\nforty bullets. \"Our cake is dough,\" he gasped. \"Take him dead, if you\ncan't alive;\" and he left running, and followed at a foot's pace. Jorian\nKetel tailed off next; and then another, and so, one by one, Gerard ran\nthem all to a standstill, except one who kept on stanch as a bloodhound,\nthough losing ground every minute. His name, if I am not mistaken,\nwas Eric Wouverman. Followed by him, they came to a rise in the wood,\nshorter, but much steeper than the last.\n\n\"Hand on mane!\" cried Martin.\n\nGerard obeyed, and the mule helped him up the hill faster even than he\nwas running before.\n\nAt the sight of this manoeuvre, Dierich's man lost heart, and, being now\nfull eighty yards behind Gerard, and rather more than that in advance of\nhis nearest comrade, he pulled up short, and, in obedience to Dierich's\norder, took down his crossbow, levelled it deliberately, and just as the\ntrio were sinking out of sight over the crest of the hill, sent the bolt\nwhizzing among them.\n\nThere was a cry of dismay; and, next moment, as if a thunder-bolt had\nfallen on them, they were all lying on the ground, mule and all.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nThe effect was so sudden and magical, that the shooter himself was\nstupefied for an instant. Then he hailed his companions to join him in\neffecting the capture, and himself set off up the hill; but, ere he had\ngot half way, up rose the figure of Martin Wittenhaagen with a bent bow\nin his hand. Eric Wouverman no sooner saw him in this attitude, than he\ndarted behind a tree, and made himself as small as possible. Martin's\nskill with that weapon was well known, and the slain dog was a keen\nreminder of it.\n\nWouverman peered round the bark cautiously: there was the arrow's point\nstill aimed at him. He saw it shine. He dared not move from his shelter.\n\nWhen he had been at peep-ho some minutes, his companions came up in\ngreat force.\n\nThen, with a scornful laugh, Martin vanished, and presently was heard to\nride off on the mule.\n\nAll the men ran up together. The high ground commanded a view of a\nnarrow but almost interminable glade.\n\nThey saw Gerard and Margaret running along at a prodigious distance;\nthey looked like gnats; and Martin galloping after them ventre a terre.\n\nThe hunters were outwitted as well as outrun. A few words will explain\nMartin's conduct. We arrive at causes by noting coincidences; yet, now\nand then, coincidences are deceitful. As we have all seen a hare tumble\nover a briar just as the gun went off, and so raise expectations, then\ndash them to earth by scudding away untouched, so the burgomaster's mule\nput her foot in a rabbit-hole at or about the time the crossbow bolt\nwhizzed innocuous over her head: she fell and threw both her riders.\nGerard caught Margaret, but was carried down by her weight and impetus;\nand, behold, the soil was strewed with dramatis personae.\n\nThe docile mule was up again directly, and stood trembling. Martin was\nnext, and looking round saw there was but one in pursuit; on this he\nmade the young lovers fly on foot, while he checked the enemy as I have\nrecorded.\n\nHe now galloped after his companions, and when after a long race he\ncaught them, he instantly put Gerard and Margaret on the mule, and ran\nby their side till his breath failed, then took his turn to ride, and so\nin rotation. Thus the runner was always fresh, and long ere they relaxed\ntheir speed all sound and trace of them was hopelessly lost to Dierich\nand his men. These latter went crestfallen back to look after their\nchief and their winged bloodhound.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nLife and liberty, while safe, are little thought of: for why? they are\nmatters of course. Endangered, they are rated at their real value. In\nthis, too, they are like sunshine, whose beauty men notice not at noon\nwhen it is greatest, but towards evening, when it lies in flakes of\ntopaz under shady elms. Yet it is feebler then; but gloom lies beside\nit, and contrast reveals its fire. Thus Gerard and Margaret, though they\nstarted at every leaf that rustled louder than its fellows, glowed all\nover with joy and thankfulness as they glided among the friendly trees\nin safety and deep tranquil silence, baying dogs and brutal voices yet\nringing in their mind's ears.\n\nBut presently Gerard found stains of blood on Margaret's ankles.\n\n\"Martin! Martin! help! they have wounded her: the crossbow!\"\n\n\"No, no!\" said Margaret, smiling to reassure him; \"I am not wounded, nor\nhurt at all.\"\n\n\"But what is it, then, in Heaven's name?\" cried Gerard, in great\nagitation.\n\n\"Scold me not, then!\" and Margaret blushed.\n\n\"Did I ever scold you?\"\n\n\"No, dear Gerard. Well, then, Martin said it was blood those cruel dogs\nfollowed; so I thought if I could but have a little blood on my shoon,\nthe dogs would follow me instead, and let my Gerard wend free. So I\nscratched my arm with Martin's knife--forgive me! Whose else could I\ntake? Yours, Gerard? Ah, no. You forgive me?\" said she beseechingly, and\nlovingly and fawningly, all in one.\n\n\"Let me see this scratch first,\" said Gerard, choking with emotion.\n\"There, I thought so. A scratch? I call it a cut--a deep, terrible,\ncruel cut.\"\n\nGerard shuddered at sight of it.\n\n\"She might have done it with her bodkin,\" said the soldier. \"Milksop!\nthat sickens at sight of a scratch and a little blood.\"\n\n\"No, no. I could look on a sea of blood, but not on hers. Oh, Margaret!\nhow could you be so cruel?\"\n\nMargaret smiled with love ineffable. \"Foolish Gerard,\" murmured she, \"to\nmake so much of nothing.\" And she flung the guilty arm round his neck.\n\"As if I would not give all the blood in my heart for you, let alone\na few drops from my arm.\" And with this, under the sense of his recent\ndanger, she wept on his neck for pity and love; and he wept with her.\n\n\"And I must part from her,\" he sobbed; \"we two that love so dear--one\nmust be in Holland, one in Italy. Ah me! ah me! ah me!\"\n\nAt this Margaret wept afresh, but patiently and silently. Instinct is\nnever off its guard, and with her unselfishness was an instinct.\nTo utter her present thoughts would be to add to Gerard's misery at\nparting, so she wept in silence.\n\nSuddenly they emerged upon a beaten path, and Martin stopped.\n\n\"This is the bridle-road I spoke of,\" said he hanging his head; \"and\nthere away lies the hostelry.\"\n\nMargaret and Gerard cast a scared look at one another.\n\n\"Come a step with me, Martin,\" whispered Gerard. When he had drawn him\naside, he said to him in a broken voice, \"Good Martin, watch over her\nfor me! She is my wife; yet I leave her. See Martin! here is gold--it\nwas for my journey; it is no use my asking her to take it--she would\nnot; but you will for her, will you not? Oh, Heaven! and is this all I\ncan do for her? Money? But poverty is a curse. You will not let her want\nfor anything, dear Martin? The burgomaster's silver is enough for me.\"\n\n\"Thou art a good lad, Gerard. Neither want nor harm shall come to her.\nI care more for her little finger than for all the world; and were she\nnought to me, even for thy sake would I be a father to her. Go with\na stout heart, and God be with thee going and coming.\" And the rough\nsoldier wrung Gerard's hand, and turned his head away, with unwonted\nfeeling.\n\nAfter a moment's silence he was for going back to Margaret, but Gerard\nstopped him. \"No, good Martin; prithee, stay here behind this thicket,\nand turn your head away from us, while I-oh, Martin! Martin!\"\n\nBy this means Gerard escaped a witness of his anguish at leaving her he\nloved, and Martin escaped a piteous sight. He did not see the poor\nyoung things kneel and renew before Heaven those holy vows cruel men had\ninterrupted. He did not see them cling together like one, and then try\nto part, and fail, and return to one another, and cling again, like\ndrowning, despairing creatures. But he heard Gerard sob, and sob, and\nMargaret moan.\n\nAt last there was a hoarse cry, and feet pattered on the hard road.\n\nHe started up, and there was Gerard running wildly, with both hands\nclasped above his head, in prayer, and Margaret tottering back towards\nhim with palms extended piteously, as if for help, and ashy cheek and\neyes fixed on vacancy.\n\nHe caught her in his arms, and spoke words of comfort to her; but her\nmind could not take them in; only at the sound of his voice she moaned\nand held him tight, and trembled violently.\n\nHe got her on the mule, and put his arm around her, and so, supporting\nher frame, which, from being strong like a boy, had now turned all\nrelaxed and powerless, he took her slowly and sadly home.\n\nShe did not shed one tear, nor speak one word.\n\nAt the edge of the wood he took her off the mule, and bade her go across\nto her father's house. She did as she was bid.\n\nMartin to Rotterdam. Sevenbergen was too hot for him.\n\nGerard, severed from her he loved, went like one in a dream. He hired a\nhorse and a guide at the little hostelry, and rode swiftly towards the\nGerman frontier. But all was mechanical; his senses felt blunted; trees\nand houses and men moved by him like objects seen through a veil. His\ncompanions spoke to him twice, but he did not answer. Only once he cried\nout savagely, \"Shall we never be out of this hateful country?\"\n\nAfter many hours' riding they came to the brow of a steep hill; a small\nbrook ran at the bottom.\n\n\"Halt!\" cried the guide, and pointed across the valley. \"Here is\nGermany.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"On t'other side of the bourn. No need to ride down the hill, I trow.\"\n\nGerard dismounted without a word, and took the burgomaster's purse from\nhis girdle: while he opened it, \"You will soon be out of this hateful\ncountry,\" said his guide, half sulkily; \"mayhap the one you are going to\nwill like you no better; any way, though it be a church you have robbed,\nthey cannot take you, once across that bourn.\"\n\nThese words at another time would have earned the speaker an admonition\nor a cuff. They fell on Gerard now like idle air. He paid the lad in\nsilence, and descended the hill alone. The brook was silvery; it ran\nmurmuring over little pebbles, that glittered, varnished by the clear\nwater; he sat down and looked stupidly at them. Then he drank of the\nbrook; then he laved his hot feet and hands in it; it was very cold:\nit waked him. He rose, and taking a run, leaped across it into Germany.\nEven as he touched the strange land he turned suddenly and looked back.\n\"Farewell, ungrateful country!\" he cried. \"But for her it would cost me\nnought to leave you for ever, and all my kith and kin, and--the mother\nthat bore me, and--my playmates, and my little native town. Farewell,\nfatherland--welcome the wide world! omne so-lum for-ti p p-at-r-a.\" And\nwith these brave words in his mouth he drooped suddenly with arms and\nlegs all weak, and sat down and sobbed bitterly upon the foreign soil.\n\nWhen the young exile had sat a while bowed down, he rose and dashed the\ntears from his eyes like a man; and not casting a single glance more\nbehind him, to weaken his heart, stepped out into the wide world.\n\nHis love and heavy sorrow left no room in him for vulgar misgivings.\nCompared with rending himself from Margaret, it seemed a small thing to\ngo on foot to Italy in that rude age.\n\nAll nations meet in a convent. So, thanks to his good friends the monks,\nand his own thirst of knowledge, he could speak most of the languages\nneeded on that long road. He said to himself, \"I will soon be at Rome;\nthe sooner the better now.\"\n\nAfter walking a good league, he came to a place where four ways\nmet. Being country roads, and serpentine, they had puzzled many an\ninexperienced neighbour passing from village to village. Gerard took out\na little dial Peter had given him, and set it in the autumn sun, and by\nthis compass steered unhesitatingly for Rome inexperienced as a young\nswallow flying south; but unlike the swallow, wandering south alone.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nNot far on this road he came upon a little group. Two men in sober suits\nstood leaning lazily on each side of a horse, talking to one another.\nThe rider, in a silk doublet and bright green jerkin and hose, both\nof English cloth, glossy as a mole, lay flat on his stomach in the\nafternoon sun, and looked an enormous lizard. His velvet cloak (flaming\nyellow) was carefully spread over the horse's loins.\n\n\"Is aught amiss?\" inquired Gerard.\n\n\"Not that I wot of,\" replied one of the servants.\n\n\"But your master, he lies like a corpse. Are ye not ashamed to let him\ngrovel on the ground?\"\n\n\"Go to; the bare ground is the best cure for his disorder. If you get\nsober in bed, it gives you a headache; but you leap up from the hard\nground like a lark in spring. Eh, Ulric?\"\n\n\"He speaks sooth, young man,\" said Ulric warmly.\n\n\"What, is the gentleman drunk?\"\n\nThe servants burst into a hoarse laugh at the simplicity of Gerard's\nquestion. But suddenly Ulric stopped, and eyeing him all over, said very\ngravely, \"Who are you, and where born, that know not the Count is ever\ndrunk at this hour?\" And Gerard found himself a suspected character.\n\n\"I am a stranger,\" said he, \"but a true man, and one that loves\nknowledge; therefore ask I questions, and not for love of prying.\"\n\n\"If you be a true man,\" said Ulric shrewdly, \"then give us trinkgeld for\nthe knowledge we have given you.\"\n\nGerard looked blank, but putting a good face on it, said, \"Trinkgeld you\nshall have, such as my lean purse can spare, an if you will tell me why\nye have ta'en his cloak from the man and laid it on the beast.\"\n\nUnder the inspiring influence of coming trinkgeld, two solutions were\ninstantly offered Gerard at once: the one was, that should the Count\ncome to himself (which, being a seasoned toper, he was apt to do all\nin a minute), and find his horse standing sweating in the cold, while\na cloak lay idle at hand, he would fall to cursing, and peradventure\nto laying on; the other, more pretentious, was, that a horse is a poor\nmilksop, which, drinking nothing but water, has to be cockered up and\nwarmed outside; but a master, being a creature ever filled with good\nbeer, has a store of inward heat that warms him to the skin, and renders\na cloak a mere shred of idle vanity.\n\nEach of the speakers fell in love with his theory, and, to tell the\ntruth, both had taken a hair or two of the dog that had bitten their\nmaster to the brain; so their voices presently rose so high, that the\ngreen sot began to growl instead of snoring. In their heat they did not\nnotice this.\n\nEre long the argument took a turn that sooner or later was pretty sure\nto enliven a discussion in that age. Hans, holding the bridle with his\nright hand, gave Ulric a sound cuff with his left; Ulric returned it\nwith interest, his right hand being free; and at it they went, ding\ndong, over the horse's mane, pommelling one another, and jagging the\npoor beast, till he ran backward, and trode with iron heel upon a\npromontory of the green lord; he, like the toad stung by Ithuriel's\nspear, started up howling, with one hand clapped to the smart and the\nother tugging at his hilt. The servants, amazed with terror, let the\nhorse go; he galloped off whinnying, the men in pursuit of him crying\nout with fear, and the green noble after them, volleying curses, his\nnaked sword in his hand, and his body rebounding from hedge to hedge in\nhis headlong but zigzag career down the narrow lane.\n\n\"In which hurtling\" Gerard turned his back on them all, and went calmly\nsouth, glad to have saved the four tin farthings he had got ready for\ntrinkgeld, but far too heavy hearted even to smile at their drunken\nextravagance.\n\n\nThe sun was nearly setting, and Gerard, who had now for some time been\nhoping in vain to find an inn by the way, was very ill at ease. To make\nmatters worse, black clouds gathered over the sky.\n\nGerard quickened his pace almost to a run.\n\nIt was in vain; down came the rain in torrents, drenched the bewildered\ntraveller, and seemed to extinguish the very sun-for his rays, already\nfading, could not cope with this new assailant.\n\nGerard trudged on, dark, and wet, and in an unknown region. \"Fool! to\nleave Margaret,\" said he.\n\nPresently the darkness thickened.\n\nHe was entering a great wood. Huge branches shot across the narrow road,\nand the benighted stranger groped his way in what seemed an interminable\nand inky cave with a rugged floor, on which he stumbled and stumbled as\nhe went.\n\nOn, and on, and on, with shivering limbs and empty stomach, and fainting\nheart, till the wolves rose from their lairs and bayed all round the\nwood.\n\nHis hair bristled; but he grasped his cudgel, and prepared to sell his\nlife dear.\n\nThere was no wind; and his excited ear heard light feet patter at times\nover the newly fallen leaves, and low branches rustle with creatures\ngliding swiftly past them.\n\nPresently in the sea of ink there was a great fiery star close to the\nground. He hailed it as he would his patron saint. \"CANDLE! a CANDLE!\"\nhe shouted, and tried to run. But the dark and rugged way soon stopped\nthat. The light was more distant than he had thought. But at last, in\nthe very heart of the forest, he found a house, with lighted candles\nand loud voices inside it. He looked up to see if there was a signboard.\nThere was none. \"Not an inn after all!\" said he sadly. \"No matter; what\nChristian would turn a dog out into this wood to-night?\" and with this\nhe made for the door that led to the voices. He opened it slowly, and\nput his head in timidly. He drew it out abruptly, as if slapped in the\nface, and recoiled into the rain and darkness.\n\nHe had peeped into a large but low room, the middle of which was filled\nby a huge round stove, or clay oven, that reached to the ceiling;\nround this, wet clothes were drying-some on lines, and some more\ncompendiously, on rustics. These latter habiliments, impregnated with\nthe wet of the day, but the dirt of a life, and lined with what another\nfoot traveller in these parts call \"rammish clowns,\" evolved rank\nvapours and compound odours inexpressible, in steaming clouds.\n\nIn one corner was a travelling family, a large one: thence flowed into\nthe common stock the peculiar sickly smell of neglected brats. Garlic\nfilled up the interstices of the air. And all this with closed window,\nand intense heat of the central furnace, and the breath of at least\nforty persons.\n\nThey had just supped.\n\nNow Gerard, like most artists, had sensitive organs, and the potent\neffluvia struck dismay into him. But the rain lashed him outside, and\nthe light and the fire tempted him in.\n\nHe could not force his way all at once through the palpable perfumes,\nbut he returned to the light again and again, like the singed moth.\nAt last he discovered that the various smells did not entirely mix, no\nfiend being there to stir them round. Odour of family predominated in\ntwo corners; stewed rustic reigned supreme in the centre; and garlic in\nthe noisy group by the window. He found, too, by hasty analysis, that of\nthese the garlic described the smallest aerial orbit, and the scent of\nreeking rustic darted farthest--a flavour as if ancient goats, or the\nfathers of all foxes, had been drawn through a river, and were here\ndried by Nebuchadnezzar.\n\nSo Gerard crept into a corner close to the door. But though the solidity\nof the main fetors isolated them somewhat, the heat and reeking vapours\ncirculated, and made the walls drip; and the home-nurtured novice found\nsomething like a cold snake wind about his legs, and his head turn to a\ngreat lump of lead; and next, he felt like choking, sweetly slumbering,\nand dying, all in one.\n\nHe was within an ace of swooning, but recovered to a deep sense of\ndisgust and discouragement; and settled to go back to Holland at peep\nof day. This resolution formed, he plucked up a little heart; and being\nfaint with hunger, asked one of the men of garlic whether this was not\nan inn after all?\n\n\"Whence come you, who know not 'The Star of the Forest'?\" was the reply.\n\n\"I am a stranger; and in my country inns have aye a sign.\"\n\n\"Droll country yours! What need of a sign to a public-house--a place\nthat every soul knows?\"\n\nGerard was too tired and faint for the labour of argument, so he turned\nthe conversation, and asked where he could find the landlord?\n\nAt this fresh display of ignorance, the native's contempt rose too high\nfor words. He pointed to a middle-aged woman seated on the other side\nof the oven; and turning to his mates, let them know what an outlandish\nanimal was in the room. Thereat the loud voices stopped, one by one, as\nthe information penetrated the mass; and each eye turned, as on a pivot,\nfollowing Gerard, and his every movement, silently and zoologically.\n\nThe landlady sat on a chair an inch or two higher than the rest, between\ntwo bundles. From the first, a huge heap of feathers and wings, she was\ntaking the downy plumes, and pulling the others from the quills, and so\nfilling bundle two littering the floor ankle-deep, and contributing to\nthe general stock a stuffy little malaria, which might have played a\ndistinguished part in a sweet room, but went for nothing here. Gerard\nasked her if he could have something to eat.\n\nShe opened her eyes with astonishment. \"Supper is over this hour and\nmore.\n\n\"But I had none of it, good dame.\"\n\n\"Is that my fault? You were welcome to your share for me.\"\n\n\"But I was benighted, and a stranger; and belated sore against my will.\"\n\n\"What have I to do with that? All the world knows 'The Star of the\nForest' sups from six till eight. Come before six, ye sup well; come\nbefore eight, ye sup as pleases Heaven; come after eight, ye get a clean\nbed, and a stirrup cup, or a horn of kine's milk, at the dawning.\"\n\nGerard looked blank. \"May I go to bed, then, dame?\" said he sulkily \"for\nit is ill sitting up wet and fasting, and the byword saith, 'He sups who\nsleeps.'\"\n\n\"The beds are not come yet,\" replied the landlady. \"You will sleep when\nthe rest do. Inns are not built for one.\"\n\nIt was Gerard's turn to be astonished. \"The beds were not come! what, in\nHeaven's name, did she mean?\" But he was afraid to ask for every word\nhe had spoken hitherto had amazed the assembly, and zoological eyes were\nupon him--he felt them. He leaned against the wall, and sighed audibly.\n\nAt this fresh zoological trait, a titter went round the watchful\ncompany.\n\n\"So this is Germany,\" thought Gerard; \"and Germany is a great country by\nHolland. Small nations for me.\"\n\nHe consoled himself by reflecting it was to be his last, as well as his\nfirst, night in the land. His reverie was interrupted by an elbow driven\ninto his ribs. He turned sharp on his assailant, who pointed across the\nroom. Gerard looked, and a woman in the corner was beckoning him. He\nwent towards her gingerly, being surprised and irresolute, so that to a\nspectator her beckoning finger seemed to be pulling him across the floor\nwith a gut-line. When he had got up to her, \"Hold the child,\" said\nshe, in a fine hearty voice; and in a moment she plumped the bairn into\nGerard's arms.\n\nHe stood transfixed, jelly of lead in his hands, and sudden horror in\nhis elongated countenance.\n\nAt this ruefully expressive face, the lynx-eyed conclave laughed loud\nand long.\n\n\"Never heed them,\" said the woman cheerfully; \"they know no better;\nhow should they, bred an' born in a wood?\" She was rummaging among her\nclothes with the two penetrating hands, one of which Gerard had set\nfree. Presently she fished out a small tin plate and a dried pudding;\nand resuming her child with one arm, held them forth to Gerard with the\nother, keeping a thumb on the pudding to prevent it from slipping off.\n\n\"Put it in the stove,\" said she; \"you are too young to lie down\nfasting.\"\n\nGerard thanked her warmly. But on his way to the stove, his eye fell on\nthe landlady. \"May I, dame?\" said he beseechingly.\n\n\"Why not?\" said she.\n\nThe question was evidently another surprise, though less startling than\nits predecessors.\n\nComing to the stove, Gerard found the oven door obstructed by \"the\nrammish clowns.\" They did not budge. He hesitated a moment. The landlady\nsaw, calmly put down her work, and coming up, pulled a hircine man or\ntwo hither, and pushed a hircine man or two thither, with the impassive\ncountenance of a housewife moving her furniture. \"Turn about is fair\nplay,\" she said; \"ye have been dry this ten minutes and better.\"\n\nHer experienced eye was not deceived; Gorgonii had done stewing, and\nbegun baking. Debarred the stove, they trundled home, all but one, who\nstood like a table, where the landlady had moved him to, like a table.\nAnd Gerard baked his pudding; and getting to the stove, burst into\nsteam.\n\nThe door opened, and in flew a bundle of straw.\n\nIt was hurled by a hind with a pitchfork. Another and another came\nflying after it, till the room was like a clean farmyard. These were\nthen dispersed round the stove in layers, like the seats in an arena,\nand in a moment the company was all on its back.\n\nThe beds had come.\n\nGerard took out his pudding, and found it delicious. While he was\nrelishing it, the woman who had given it him, and who was now abed,\nbeckoned him again. He went to her bundle side. \"She is waiting for\nyou,\" whispered the woman. Gerard returned to the stove, and gobbled.\nthe rest of his sausage, casting uneasy glances at the landlady, seated\nsilent as fate amid the prostrate multitude. The food bolted, he went to\nher, and said, \"Thank you kindly, dame, for waiting for me.\"\n\n\"You are welcome,\" said she calmly, making neither much nor little of\nthe favour; and with that began to gather up the feathers. But Gerard\nstopped her. \"Nay, that is my task;\" and he went down on his knees, and\ncollected them with ardour. She watched him demurely.\n\n\"I wot not whence ye come,\" said she, with a relic of distrust; adding,\nmore cordially, \"but ye have been well brought up;--y' have had a good\nmother, I'll go bail.\"\n\nAt the door she committed the whole company to Heaven, in a formula, and\ndisappeared. Gerard to his straw in the very corner-for the guests lay\nround the sacred stove by seniority, i.e. priority of arrival.\n\nThis punishment was a boon to Gerard, for thus he lay on the shore of\nodour and stifling heat, instead of in mid-ocean.\n\nHe was just dropping off, when he was awaked by a noise; and lo there\nwas the hind remorselessly shaking and waking guest after guest, to ask\nhim whether it was he who had picked up the mistress's feathers.\n\n\"It was I,\" cried Gerard.\n\n\"Oh, it was you, was it?\" said the other, and came striding rapidly over\nthe intermediate sleepers. \"She bade me say, 'One good turn deserves\nanother,' and so here's your nightcap,\" and he thrust a great oaken mug\nunder Gerard's nose.\n\n\"I thank her, and bless her; here goes--ugh!\" and his gratitude ended in\na wry face; for the beer was muddy, and had a strange, medicinal twang\nnew to the Hollander.\n\n\"Trinke aus!\" shouted the hind reproachfully.\n\n\"Enow is as good as a feast,\" said the youth Jesuitically.\n\nThe hind cast a look of pity on this stranger who left liquor in his\nmug. \"Ich brings euch,\" said he, and drained it to the bottom.\n\nAnd now Gerard turned his face to the wall and pulled up two handfuls of\nthe nice clean straw, and bored in them with his finger, and so made a\nscabbard, and sheathed his nose in it. And soon they were all asleep;\nmen, maids, wives, and children all lying higgledy-piggledy, and snoring\nin a dozen keys like an orchestra slowly tuning; and Gerard's body lay\non straw in Germany, and his spirit was away to Sevenbergen.\n\n\nWhen he woke in the morning he found nearly all his fellow-passengers\ngone. One or two were waiting for dinner, nine o'clock; it was now\nsix. He paid the landlady her demand, two pfenning, or about an English\nhalfpenny, and he of the pitchfork demanded trinkgeld, and getting a\ntrifle more than usual, and seeing Gerard eye a foaming milk-pail he had\njust brought from the cow, hoisted it up bodily to his lips. \"Drink your\nfill, man,\" said he, and on Gerard offering to pay for the delicious\ndraught, told him in broad patois that a man might swallow a skinful of\nmilk, or a breakfast of air, without putting hand to pouch. At the door\nGerard found his benefactress of last night, and a huge-chested artisan,\nher husband.\n\nGerard thanked her, and in the spirit of the age offered her a creutzer\nfor her pudding.\n\nBut she repulsed his hand quietly. \"For what do you take me?\" said she,\ncolouring faintly; \"we are travellers and strangers the same as you, and\nbound to feel for those in like plight.\"\n\nThen Gerard blushed in his turn and stammered excuses.\n\nThe hulking husband grinned superior to them both.\n\n\"Give the vixen a kiss for her pudding, and cry quits,\" said he, with an\nair impartial, judge-like and Jove-like.\n\nGerard obeyed the lofty behest, and kissed the wife's cheek. \"A blessing\ngo with you both, good people,\" said he.\n\n\"And God speed you, young man!\" replied the honest couple; and with that\nthey parted, and never met again in this world.\n\nThe sun had just risen: the rain-drops on the leaves glittered like\ndiamonds. The air was fresh and bracing, and Gerard steered south, and\ndid not even remember his resolve of overnight.\n\nEight leagues he walked that day, and in the afternoon came upon a huge\nbuilding with an enormous arched gateway and a postern by its side.\n\n\"A monastery!\" cried he joyfully; \"I go no further lest I fare worse.\" He\napplied at the postern, and on stating whence he came and whither bound,\nwas instantly admitted and directed to the guestchamber, a large and\nlofty room, where travellers were fed and lodged gratis by the charity\nof the monastic orders. Soon the bell tinkled for vespers, and Gerard\nentered the church of the convent, and from his place heard a service\nsung so exquisitely, it seemed the choir of heaven. But one thing was\nwanting, Margaret was not there to hear it with him, and this made\nhim sigh bitterly in mid rapture. At supper, plain but wholesome and\nabundant food, and good beer, brewed in the convent, were set before\nhim and his fellows, and at an early hour they were ushered into a large\ndormitory, and the number being moderate, had each a truckle bed, and\nfor covering, sheepskins dressed with the fleece on; but previously to\nthis a monk, struck by his youth and beauty, questioned him, and soon\ndrew out his projects and his heart. When he was found to be convent\nbred, and going alone to Rome, he became a personage, and in the morning\nthey showed him over the convent and made him stay and dine in the\nrefectory. They also pricked him a route on a slip of parchment, and the\nprior gave him a silver guilden to help him on the road, and advised him\nto join the first honest company he should fall in with, \"and not face\nalone the manifold perils of the way.\"\n\n\"Perils?\" said Gerard to himself.\n\nThat evening he came to a small straggling town where was one inn; it\nhad no sign; but being now better versed in the customs of the country,\nhe detected it at once by the coats of arms on its walls. These belonged\nto the distinguished visitors who had slept in it at different\nepochs since its foundation, and left these customary tokens of their\npatronage. At present it looked more like a mausoleum than a hotel.\nNothing moved nor sounded either in it or about it. Gerard hammered on\nthe great oak door: no answer. He hallooed: no reply. After a while he\nhallooed louder, and at last a little round window, or rather hole in\nthe wall, opened, a man's head protruded cautiously, like a tortoise's\nfrom its shell, and eyed Gerard stolidly, but never uttered a syllable.\n\n\"Is this an inn?\" asked Gerard, with a covert sneer.\n\nThe head seemed to fall into a brown study; eventually it nodded, but\nlazily.\n\n\"Can I have entertainment here?\"\n\nAgain the head pondered and ended by nodding, but sullenly, and seemed a\nskull overburdened with catch-penny interrogatories.\n\n\"How am I to get within, an't please you?\"\n\nAt this the head popped in, as if the last question had shot it; and a\nhand popped out, pointed round the corner of the building, and slammed\nthe window.\n\nGerard followed the indication, and after some research discovered\nthat the fortification had one vulnerable part, a small low door on its\nflank. As for the main entrance, that was used to keep out thieves and\ncustomers, except once or twice in a year, when they entered together,\ni.e., when some duke or count arrived in pomp with his train of gaudy\nruffians.\n\nGerard, having penetrated the outer fort, soon found his way to the\nstove (as the public room was called from the principal article in it),\nand sat down near the oven, in which were only a few live embers that\ndiffused a mild and grateful heat.\n\nAfter waiting patiently a long time, he asked a grim old fellow with a\nlong white beard, who stalked solemnly in, and turned the hour-glass,\nand then was stalking out, when supper would be. The grisly Ganymede\ncounted the guests on his fingers--\"When I see thrice as many here as\nnow.\" Gerard groaned.\n\nThe grisly tyrant resented the rebellious sound. \"Inns are not built\nfor one,\" said he; \"if you can't wait for the rest, look out for another\nlodging.\"\n\nGerard sighed.\n\nAt this the greybeard frowned.\n\nAfter a while company trickled steadily in, till full eighty persons of\nvarious conditions were congregated, and to our novice the place became\na chamber of horrors; for here the mothers got together and compared\nringworms, and the men scraped the mud off their shoes with their\nknives, and left it on the floor, and combed their long hair out,\ninmates included, and made their toilet, consisting generally of a dry\nrub. Water, however, was brought in ewers. Gerard pounced on one of\nthese, but at sight of the liquid contents lost his temper and said\nto the waiter, \"Wash you first your water, and then a man may wash his\nhands withal.\"\n\n\"An' it likes you not, seek another inn!\"\n\nGerard said nothing, but went quietly and courteously besought an old\ntraveller to tell him how far it was to the next inn.\n\n\"About four leagues.\"\n\nThen Gerard appreciated the grim pleasantry of the unbending sire.\n\nThat worthy now returned with an armful of wood, and counting the\ntravellers, put on a log for every six, by which act of raw justice the\nhotter the room the more heat he added. Poor Gerard noticed this little\nflaw in the ancient man's logic, but carefully suppressed every symptom\nof intelligence, lest his feet should have to carry his brains four\nleagues farther that night.\n\nWhen perspiration and suffocation were far advanced, they brought in\nthe table-cloths; but oh, so brown, so dirty, and so coarse; they seemed\nlike sacks that had been worn out in agriculture and come down to this,\nor like shreads from the mainsail of some worn-out ship. The Hollander,\nwho had never seen such linen even in nightmare, uttered a faint cry.\n\n\"What is to do?\" inquired a traveller. Gerard pointed ruefully to\nthe dirty sackcloth. The other looked at it with lack lustre eye, and\ncomprehended nought.\n\nA Burgundian soldier with his arbalest at his back came peeping over\nGerard's shoulder, and seeing what was amiss, laughed so loud that the\nroom rang again, then slapped him on the back and cried, \"Courage! le\ndiable est mort.\"\n\nGerard stared: he doubted alike the good tidings and their\nrelevancy; but the tones were so hearty and the arbalestrier's face,\nnotwithstanding a formidable beard, was so gay and genial, that he\nsmiled, and after a pause said drily, \"Il a bien faite avec l'eau et\nlinge du pays on allait le noircir a ne se reconnaitre plus.\"\n\n\"Tiens, tiens!\" cried the soldier, \"v'la qui parle le Francais peu s'en\nfaut,\" and he seated himself by Gerard, and in a moment was talking\nvolubly of war, women, and pillage, interlarding his discourse with\ncurious oaths, at which Gerard drew away from him more or less.\n\nPresently in came the grisly servant, and counted them all on his\nfingers superciliously, like Abraham telling sheep; then went out again,\nand returned with a deal trencher and deal spoon to each.\n\nThen there was an interval. Then he brought them a long mug apiece made\nof glass, and frowned. By-and-by he stalked gloomily in with a hunch of\nbread apiece, and exit with an injured air. Expectation thus raised,\nthe guests sat for nearly an hour balancing the wooden spoons, and with\ntheir own knives whittling the bread. Eventually, when hope was extinct,\npatience worn out, and hunger exhausted, a huge vessel was brought\nin with pomp, the lid was removed, a cloud of steam rolled forth, and\nbehold some thin broth with square pieces of bread floating. This,\nthough not agreeable to the mind, served to distend the body. Slices of\nStrasbourg ham followed, and pieces of salt fish, both so highly salted\nthat Gerard could hardly swallow a mouthful. Then came a kind of gruel,\nand when the repast had lasted an hour and more, some hashed meat highly\npeppered and the French and Dutch being now full to the brim with the\nabove dainties, and the draughts of beer the salt and spiced meats had\nprovoked, in came roasted kids, most excellent, and carp and trout fresh\nfrom the stream. Gerard made an effort and looked angrily at them, but\n\"could no more,\" as the poets say. The Burgundian swore by the liver and\npike-staff of the good centurion, the natives had outwitted him. Then\nturning to Gerard, he said, \"Courage, l'ami, le diable est mort,\" as\nloudly as before, but not with the same tone of conviction. The canny\nnatives had kept an internal corner for contingencies, and polished the\nkid's very bones.\n\nThe feast ended with a dish of raw animalcula in a wicker cage. A cheese\nhad been surrounded with little twigs and strings; then a hole made\nin it and a little sour wine poured in. This speedily bred a small but\nnumerous vermin. When the cheese was so rotten with them that only\nthe twigs and string kept it from tumbling to pieces and walking off\nquadrivious, it came to table. By a malicious caprice of fate, cage\nand menagerie were put down right under the Dutchman's organ of\nself-torture. He recoiled with a loud ejaculation, and hung to the bench\nby the calves of his legs.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" said a traveller disdainfully. \"Does the good\ncheese scare ye? Then put it hither, in the name of all the saints!\"\n\n\"Cheese!\" cried Gerard, \"I see none. These nauseous reptiles have made\naway with every bit of it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied another, \"it is not gone far. By eating of the mites we\neat the cheese to boot.\"\n\n\"Nay, not so,\" said Gerard. \"These reptiles are made like us, and digest\ntheir food and turn it to foul flesh even as we do ours to sweet; as\nwell might you think to chew grass by eating of grass-fed beeves, as to\neat cheese by swallowing these uncleanly insects.\"\n\nGerard raised his voice in uttering this, and the company received the\nparadox in dead silence, and with a distrustful air, like any other\nstranger, during which the Burgundian, who understood German but\nimperfectly, made Gerard Gallicize the discussion. He patted his\ninterpreter on the back. \"C'est bien, mon gars; plus fin que toi n'est\npas bete,\" and administered his formula of encouragement; and Gerard\nedged away from him; for next to ugly sights and ill odours, the poor\nwretch disliked profaneness.\n\nMeantime, though shaken in argument, the raw reptiles were duly eaten\nand relished by the company, and served to provoke thirst, a principal\naim of all the solids in that part of Germany. So now the company drank\ngarausses all round, and their tongues were unloosed, and oh, the Babel!\nBut above the fierce clamour rose at intervals, like some hero's war-cry\nin battle, the trumpet-like voice of the Burgundian soldier shouting\nlustily, \"Courage, camarades, le diable est mort!\"\n\nEntered grisly Ganymede holding in his hand a wooden dish with circles\nand semicircles marked on it in chalk. He put it down on the table\nand stood silent, sad, and sombre, as Charon by Styx waiting for his\nboat-load of souls. Then pouches and purses were rummaged, and each\nthrew a coin into the dish. Gerard timidly observed that he had drunk\nnext to no beer, and inquired how much less he was to pay than the\nothers.\n\n\"What mean you?\" said Ganymede roughly. \"Whose fault is it you have not\ndrunken? Are all to suffer because one chooses to be a milksop? You will\npay no more than the rest, and no less.\"\n\nGerard was abashed.\n\n\"Courage, petit, le diable est mort,\" hiccoughed the soldier and flung\nGanymede a coin.\n\n\"You are bad as he is,\" said the old man peevishly; \"you are paying too\nmuch;\" and the tyrannical old Aristides returned him some coin out of\nthe trencher with a most reproachful countenance. And now the man whom\nGerard had confuted an hour and a half ago awoke from a brown study, in\nwhich he had been ever since, and came to him and said, \"Yes, but the\nhoney is none the worse for passing through the bees' bellies.\"\n\nGerard stared. The answer had been so long on the road he hadn't an idea\nwhat it was an answer to. Seeing him dumfounded, the other concluded him\nconfuted, and withdrew calmed.\n\nThe bedrooms were upstairs, dungeons with not a scrap of furniture\nexcept the bed, and a male servant settled inexorably who should sleep\nwith whom. Neither money nor prayers would get a man a bed to himself\nhere; custom forbade it sternly. You might as well have asked to\nmonopolize a see-saw. They assigned to Gerard a man with a great black\nbeard. He was an honest fellow enough, but not perfect; he would not go\nto bed, and would sit on the edge of it telling the wretched Gerard by\nforce, and at length, the events of the day, and alternately laughing\nand crying at the same circumstances, which were not in the smallest\ndegree pathetic or humorous, but only dead trivial. At last Gerard put\nhis fingers in his ears, and lying down in his clothes, for the sheets\nwere too dirty for him to undress, contrived to sleep. But in an hour or\ntwo he awoke cold, and found that his drunken companion had got all the\nfeather bed; so mighty is instinct. They lay between two beds; the lower\none hard and made of straw, the upper soft and filled with feathers\nlight as down. Gerard pulled at it, but the experienced drunkard held\nit fast mechanically. Gerard tried to twitch it away by surprise, but\ninstinct was too many for him. On this he got out of bed, and kneeling\ndown on his bedfellow's unguarded side, easily whipped the prize away\nand rolled with it under the bed, and there lay on one edge of it, and\ncurled the rest round his shoulders. Before he slept he often heard\nsomething grumbling and growling above him, which was some little\nsatisfaction. Thus instinct was outwitted, and victorious Reason lay\nchuckling on feathers, and not quite choked with dust.\n\nAt peep of day Gerard rose, flung the feather bed upon his snoring\ncompanion, and went in search of milk and air.\n\nA cheerful voice hailed him in French: \"What ho! you are up with the\nsun, comrade.\"\n\n\"He rises betimes that lies in a dog's lair,\" answered Gerard crossly.\n\n\"Courage, l'ami! le diable est mort,\" was the instant reply. The soldier\nthen told him his name was Denys, and he was passing from Flushing in\nZealand to the Duke's French dominions; a change the more agreeable to\nhim, as he should revisit his native place, and a host of pretty girls\nwho had wept at his departure, and should hear French spoken again. \"And\nwho are you, and whither bound?\"\n\n\"My name is Gerard, and I am going to Rome,\" said the more reserved\nHollander, and in a way that invited no further confidences.\n\n\"All the better; we will go together as far as Burgundy.\"\n\n\"That is not my road.\"\n\n\"All roads take to Rome.\"\n\n\"Ay, but the shortest road thither is my way.\"\n\n\"Well, then, it is I who must go out of my way a step for the sake\nof good company, for thy face likes me, and thou speakest French, or\nnearly.\"\n\n\"There go two words to that bargain,\" said Gerard coldly. \"I steer by\nproverbs, too. They do put old heads on young men's shoulders. 'Bon loup\nmauvais compagnon, dit le brebis;' and a soldier, they say, is near akin\nto a wolf.\"\n\n\"They lie,\" said Denys; \"besides, if he is, 'les loups ne se mangent pas\nentre eux.'\"\n\n\"Aye but, sir soldier, I am not a wolf; and thou knowest, a bien petite\noccasion se saisit le loup du mouton.'\"\n\n\"Let us drop wolves and sheep, being men; my meaning is, that a good\nsoldier never pillages-a comrade. Come, young man, too much suspicion\nbecomes not your years. They who travel should learn to read faces;\nmethinks you might see lealty in mine sith I have seen it in yourn. Is\nit yon fat purse at your girdle you fear for?\" (Gerard turned pale.)\n\"Look hither!\" and he undid his belt, and poured out of it a double\nhandful of gold pieces, then returned them to their hiding-place.\n\"There is a hostage for you,\" said he; \"carry you that, and let us be\ncomrades,\" and handed him his belt, gold and all.\n\nGerard stared. \"If I am over prudent, you have not enow.\" But he flushed\nand looked pleased at the other's trust in him.\n\n\"Bah! I can read faces; and so must you, or you'll never take your four\nbones safe to Rome.\"\n\n\"Soldier, you would find me a dull companion, for my heart is very\nheavy,\" said Gerard, yielding.\n\n\"I'll cheer you, mon gars.\"\n\n\"I think you would,\" said Gerard sweetly; \"and sore need have I of a\nkindly voice in mine ear this day.\"\n\n\"Oh! no soul is sad alongside me. I lift up their poor little hearts\nwith my consigne: 'Courage, tout le monde, le diable est mort.' Ha! ha!\"\n\n\"So be it, then,\" said Gerard. \"But take back your belt, for I could\nnever trust by halves. We will go together as far as Rhine, and God go\nwith us both!\"\n\n\"Amen!\" said Denys, and lifted his cap. \"En avant!\"\n\n\nThe pair trudged manfully on, and Denys enlivened the weary way. He\nchattered about battles and sieges, and things which were new to Gerard;\nand he was one of those who make little incidents wherever they go. He\npassed nobody without addressing them. \"They don't understand it, but\nit wakes them up,\" said he. But whenever they fell in with a monk\nor priest. He pulled a long face, and sought the reverend father's\nblessing, and fearlessly poured out on him floods of German words in\nsuch order as not to produce a single German sentence--He doffed his\ncap to every woman, high or low, he caught sight of, and with eagle eye\ndiscerned her best feature, and complimented her on it in his native\ntongue, well adapted to such matters; and at each carrion crow or\nmagpie, down came his crossbow, and he would go a furlong off the road\nto circumvent it; and indeed he did shoot one old crow with laudable\nneatness and despatch, and carried it to the nearest hen-roost, and\nthere slipped in and set it upon a nest. \"The good-wife will say,\n'Alack, here is Beelzebub ahatching of my eggs.'\"\n\n\"No, you forget he is dead,\" objected Gerard.\n\n\"So he is, so he is. But she doesn't know that, not having the luck\nto be acquainted with me, who carry the good news from city to city,\nuplifting men's hearts.\"\n\nSuch was Denys in time of peace.\n\nOur travellers towards nightfall reached a village; it was a very small\none, but contained a place of entertainment. They searched for it,\nand found a small house with barn and stables. In the former was the\neverlasting stove, and the clothes drying round it on lines, and a\ntraveller or two sitting morose. Gerard asked for supper.\n\n\"Supper? We have no time to cook for travellers; we only provide\nlodging, good lodging for man and beast. You can have some beer.\"\n\n\"Madman, who, born in Holland, sought other lands!\" snorted Gerard in\nDutch. The landlady started.\n\n\"What gibberish is that?\" asked she, and crossed herself with looks of\nsuperstitious alarm. \"You can buy what you like in the village, and cook\nit in our oven; but, prithee, mutter no charms nor sorceries here, good\nman; don't ye now, it do make my flesh creep so.\"\n\nThey scoured the village for food, and ended by supping on roasted eggs\nand brown bread.\n\nAt a very early hour their chambermaid came for them. It was a\nrosy-cheeked old fellow with a lanthorn.\n\nThey followed him. He led them across a dirty farmyard, where they had\nmuch ado to pick their steps, and brought them into a cow-house. There,\non each side of every cow, was laid a little clean straw, and a tied\nbundle of ditto for a pillow. The old man looked down on this his work\nwith paternal pride. Not so Gerard. \"What, do you set Christian men to\nlie among cattle?\"\n\n\"Well, it is hard upon the poor beasts. They have scarce room to turn.\"\n\n\"Oh! what, it is not hard on us, then?\"\n\n\"Where is the hardship? I have lain among them all my life. Look at me!\nI am fourscore, and never had a headache in all my born days--all along\nof lying among the kye. Bless your silly head, kine's breath is ten\ntimes sweeter to drink nor Christians'. You try it!\" and he slammed the\nbedroom door.\n\n\"Denys, where are you?\" whined Gerard.\n\n\"Here, on her other side.\"\n\n\"What are you doing?\"\n\n\"I know not; but as near as I can guess, I think I must be going to\nsleep. What are you at?\n\n\"I am saying my prayers.\"\n\n\"Forget me not in them!\"\n\n\"Is it likely? Denys, I shall soon have done: do not go to sleep, I want\nto talk.\n\n\"Despatch then! for I feel--augh like floating-in the sky on a warm\ncloud.\"\n\n\"Denys!\"\n\n\"Augh! eh! hallo! is it time to get up?\"\n\n\"Alack, no. There, I hurried my orisons to talk; and look at you, going\nto sleep! We shall be starved before morning, having no coverlets.\"\n\n\"Well, you know what to do.\"\n\n\"Not I, in sooth.\"\n\n\"Cuddle the cow.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Burrow in the straw, then. You must be very new to the world, to\ngrumble at this. How would you bear to lie on the field of battle on a\nfrosty night, as I did t'other day, stark naked, with nothing to keep me\nwarm but the carcass of a fellow I had been and helped kill?\"\n\n\"Horrible! horrible! Tell me all about it! Oh, but this is sweet.\"\n\n\"Well, we had a little battle in Brabant, and won a little victory, but\nit cost us dear; several arbalestriers turned their toes up, and I among\nthem.\"\n\n\"Killed, Denys? come now!\"\n\n\"Dead as mutton. Stuck full of pike-holes till the blood ran out of\nme, like the good wine of Macon from the trodden grapes. It is right\nbounteous in me to pour the tale in minstrel phrase, for--augh--I am\nsleepy. Augh--now where was I?\"\n\n\"Left dead on the field of battle, bleeding like a pig; that is to say,\nlike grapes, or something; go on, prithee go on, 'tis a sin to sleep in\nthe midst of a good story.\"\n\n\"Granted. Well, some of those vagabonds, that strip the dead soldier on\nthe field of glory, came and took every rag off me; they wrought me no\nfurther ill, because there was no need.\"\n\n\"No; you were dead.\"\n\n\"C'est convenu. This must have been at sundown; and with the night came\na shrewd frost that barkened the blood on my wounds, and stopped all the\nrivulets that were running from my heart, and about midnight I awoke as\nfrom a trance.'\n\n\"And thought you were in heaven?\" asked Gerard eagerly, being a youth\ninoculated with monkish tales.\n\n\"Too frost-bitten for that, mon gars; besides, I heard the wounded\ngroaning on all sides, so I knew I was in the old place. I saw I could\nnot live the night through without cover. I groped about shivering and\nshivering; at last one did suddenly leave groaning. 'You are sped,' said\nI, so made up to him, and true enough he was dead, but warm, you know.\nI took my lord in my arms, but was too weak to carry him, so rolled with\nhim into a ditch hard by; and there my comrades found me in the morning\nproperly stung with nettles, and hugging a dead Fleming for the bare\nlife.\"\n\nGerard shuddered. \"And this is war; this is the chosen theme of poets\nand troubadours, and Reden Ryckers. Truly was it said by the men of old,\ndulce bellum inexpertis.\"\n\n\"Tu dis?\"\n\n\"I say-oh, what stout hearts some men have!\"\n\n\"N'est-ce pas, p'tit? So after that sort--thing--this sort thing is\nheaven. Soft--warm--good company, comradancow--cou'age--diable--m-ornk!\"\n\nAnd the glib tongue was still for some hours.\n\nIn the morning Gerard was wakened by a liquid hitting his eye, and it\nwas Denys employing the cow's udder as a squirt.\n\n\"Oh, fie!\" cried Gerard, \"to waste the good milk;\" and he took a horn\nout of his wallet. \"Fill this! but indeed I see not what right we have\nto meddle with her milk at all.\"\n\n\"Make your mind easy! Last night la camarade was not nice; but what\nthen, true friendship dispenses with ceremony. To-day we make as free\nwith her.\"\n\n\"Why, what did she do, poor thing?\"\n\n\"Ate my pillow.\"\n\n\"Ha! ha!\"\n\n\"On waking I had to hunt for my head, and found it down in the stable\ngutter. She ate our pillow from us, we drink our pillow from her. A\nvotre sante, madame; et sans rancune;\" and the dog drank her milk to her\nown health.\n\n\"The ancient was right though,\" said Gerard. \"Never have I risen so\nrefreshed since I left my native land. Henceforth let us shun great\ntowns, and still lie in a convent or a cow-house; for I'd liever sleep\non fresh straw, than on linen well washed six months agone; and the\nbreath of kine it is sweeter than that of Christians, let alone the\ngarlic, which men and women folk affect, but cowen abhor from, and so do\nI, St. Bavon be my witness!\"\n\nThe soldier eyed him from head to foot: \"Now but for that little tuft on\nyour chin I should take you for a girl; and by the finger-nails of St.\nLuke, no ill-favoured one neither.\"\n\nThese three towns proved types and repeated themselves with slight\nvariations for many a weary league; but even when he could get neither a\nconvent nor a cow-house, Gerard learned in time to steel himself to\nthe inevitable, and to emulate his comrade, whom he looked on as almost\nsuperhuman for hardihood of body and spirit.\n\nThere was, however, a balance to all this veneration.\n\nDenys, like his predecessor Achilles, had his weak part, his very weak\npart, thought Gerard.\n\nHis foible was \"woman.\"\n\nWhatever he was saying or doing, he stopped short at sight of a\nfarthingale, and his whole soul became occupied with that garment and\nits inmate till they had disappeared; and sometimes for a good while\nafter.\n\nHe often put Gerard to the blush by talking his amazing German to such\nfemales as he caught standing or sitting indoors or out, at which they\nstared; and when he met a peasant girl on the road, he took off his cap\nto her and saluted her as if she was a queen; the invariable effect of\nwhich was, that she suddenly drew herself up quite stiff like a soldier\non parade, and wore a forbidding countenance.\n\n\"They drive me to despair,\" said Denys. \"Is that a just return to a\ncivil bonnetade? They are large, they are fair, but stupid as swans.\"\n\n\"What breeding can you expect from women that wear no hose?\" inquired\nGerard; \"and some of them no shoon? They seem to me reserved and modest,\nas becomes their sex, and sober, whereas the men are little better than\nbeer-barrels. Would you have them brazen as well as hoseless?\"\n\n\"A little affability adorns even beauty,\" sighed Denys.\n\n\"Then let these alone, sith they are not to your taste,\" retorted\nGerard. \"What, is there no sweet face in Burgundy that would pale to see\nyou so wrapped up in strange women?\"\n\n\"Half-a-dozen that would cry their eyes out.\"\n\n\"Well then!\"\n\n\"But it is a long way to Burgundy.\"\n\n\"Ay, to the foot, but not to the heart. I am there, sleeping and waking,\nand almost every minute of the day.\"\n\n\"In Burgundy? Why, I thought you had never--\"\n\n\"In Burgundy?\" cried Gerard contemptuously. \"No, in sweet Sevenbergen.\nAh! well-a-day! well-a-day!\"\n\nMany such dialogues as this passed between the pair on the long and\nweary road, and neither could change the other.\n\nOne day about noon they reached a town of some pretensions, and Gerard\nwas glad, for he wanted to buy a pair of shoes; his own were quite worn\nout. They soon found a shop that displayed a goodly array, and made up\nto it, and would have entered it, but the shopkeeper sat on the doorstep\ntaking a nap, and was so fat as to block up the narrow doorway; the very\nlight could hardly struggle past his \"too, too solid flesh,\" much less a\ncarnal customer.\n\nMy fair readers, accustomed, when they go shopping, to be met half way\nwith nods, and becks, and wreathed smiles, and waved into a seat, while\nalmost at the same instant an eager shopman flings himself half\nacross the counter in a semi-circle to learn their commands, can best\nappreciate this mediaeval Teuton, who kept a shop as a dog keeps a\nkennel, and sat at the exclusion of custom snoring like a pig.\n\nDenys and Gerard stood and contemplated this curiosity; emblem, permit\nme to remark, of the lets and hindrances to commerce that characterized\nhis epoch.\n\n\"Jump over him!\"\n\n\"The door is too low.\"\n\n\"March through him!\"\n\n\"The man is too thick.\"\n\n\"What is the coil?\" inquired a mumbling voice from the interior;\napprentice with his mouth full.\n\n\"We want to get into your shop?\"\n\n\"What for, in Heaven's name??!!!\"\n\n\"Shoon, lazy bones!\"\n\nThe ire of the apprentice began to rise at such an explanation. \"And\ncould ye find no hour out of all the twelve to come pestering us for\nshoon, but the one little, little hour my master takes his nap, and I\nsit down to my dinner, when all the rest of the world is full long ago?\"\n\nDenys heard, but could not follow the sense. \"Waste no more time talking\ntheir German gibberish,\" said he; \"take out thy knife and tickle his fat\nribs.\"\n\n\"That I will not,\" said Gerard.\n\n\"Then here goes; I'll prong him with this.\"\n\nGerard seized the mad fellow's arm in dismay, for he had been long\nenough in the country to guess that the whole town would take part in\nany brawl with the native against a stranger. But Denys twisted away\nfrom him, and the cross-bow bolt in his hand was actually on the road to\nthe sleeper's ribs; but at that very moment two females crossed the road\ntowards him; he saw the blissful vision, and instantly forgot what he\nwas about, and awaited their approach with unreasonable joy.\n\nThough companions, they were not equals, except in attractiveness to a\nBurgundian crossbow man; for one was very tall, the other short, and\nby one of those anomalies which society, however primitive, speedily\nestablishes, the long one held up the little one's tail. The tall one\nwore a plain linen coif on her head, a little grogram cloak over her\nshoulders, a grey kirtle, and a short farthingale or petticoat of bright\nred cloth, and feet and legs quite bare, though her arms were veiled in\ntight linen sleeves.\n\nThe other a kirtle broadly trimmed with fur, her arms in double sleeves,\nwhereof the inner of yellow satin clung to the skin; the outer, all\nbefurred, were open at the inside of the elbow, and so the arm passed\nthrough and left them dangling. Velvet head-dress, huge purse at girdle,\ngorgeous train, bare legs. And thus they came on, the citizen's wife\nstrutting, and the maid gliding after, holding her mistress's train\ndevoutly in both hands, and bending and winding her lithe body prettily\nenough to do it. Imagine (if not pressed for time) a bantam, with a\nguineahen stepping obsequious at its stately heel.\n\nThis pageant made straight for the shoemaker's shop. Denys louted low;\nthe worshipful lady nodded graciously, but rapidly, having business\non hand, or rather on foot; for in a moment she poked the point of her\nlittle shoe into the sleeper, and worked it round in him like a gimlet,\ntill with a long snarl he woke. The incarnate shutter rising and\ngrumbling vaguely, the lady swept in and deigned him no further notice.\nHe retreated to his neighbour's shop, the tailor's, and sitting on the\nstep, protected it from the impertinence of morning calls. Neighbours\nshould be neighbourly.\n\nDenys and Gerard followed the dignity into the shop, where sat the\napprentice at dinner; the maid stood outside with her insteps crossed,\nleaning against the wall, and tapping it with her nails.\n\n\"Those, yonder,\" said the dignity briefly, pointing with an imperious\nlittle white hand to some yellow shoes gilded at the toe. While the\napprentice stood stock still neutralized by his dinner and his duty,\nDenys sprang at the shoes, and brought them to her; she smiled, and\ncalmly seating herself, protruded her foot, shod, but hoseless, and\nscented. Down went Denys on his knees, and drew off her shoe, and tried\nthe new ones on the white skin devoutly. Finding she had a willing\nvictim, she abused the opportunity, tried first one pair, then another,\nthen the first again, and so on, balancing and hesitating for about half\nan hour, to Gerard's disgust, and Denys's weak delight. At last she was\nfitted, and handed two pair of yellow and one pair of red shoes out to\nher servant. Then was heard a sigh. It burst from the owner of the shop:\nhe had risen from slumber, and was now hovering about, like a partridge\nnear her brood in danger.\n\n\"There go all my coloured shoes,\" said he, as they disappeared in the\ngirl's apron.\n\nThe lady departed: Gerard fitted himself with a stout pair, asked the\nprice, paid it without a word, and gave his old ones to a beggar in the\nstreet, who blessed him in the marketplace, and threw them furiously\ndown a well in the suburbs. The comrades left the shop, and in it two\nmelancholy men, that looked, and even talked, as if they had been robbed\nwholesale.\n\n\"My shoon are sore worn,\" said Denys, grinding his teeth; \"but I'll go\nbarefoot till I reach France, ere I'll leave my money with such churls\nas these.\"\n\nThe Dutchman replied calmly, \"They seem indifferent well sewn.\"\n\nAs they drew near the Rhine, they passed through forest after forest,\nand now for the first time ugly words sounded in travellers' mouths,\nseated around stoves. \"Thieves!\" \"black gangs!\" \"cut-throats!\" etc.\n\nThe very rustics were said to have a custom hereabouts of murdering the\nunwary traveller in these gloomy woods, whose dark and devious winding\nenabled those who were familiar with them to do deeds of rapine and\nblood undetected, or if detected, easily to baffle pursuit.\n\nCertain it was, that every clown they met carried, whether for offence\nor defence, a most formidable weapon; a light axe, with a short pike at\nthe head, and a long slender handle of ash or yew, well seasoned. These\nthe natives could all throw with singular precision, so as to make\nthe point strike an object at several yard's distance, or could slay\na bullock at hand with a stroke of the blade. Gerard bought one and\npractised with it. Denys quietly filed and ground his bolt sharp,\nwhistling the whilst; and when they entered a gloomy wood, he would\nunsling his crossbow and carry it ready for action; but not so much like\na traveller fearing an attack, as a sportsman watchful not to miss a\nsnap shot.\n\nOne day, being in a forest a few leagues from Dusseldorf, as Gerard was\nwalking like one in a dream, thinking of Margaret, and scarce seeing the\nroad he trode, his companion laid a hand on his shoulder, and strung\nhis crossbow with glittering eye. \"Hush!\" said he, in a low whisper that\nstartled Gerard more than thunder. Gerard grasped his axe tight, and\nshook a little: he heard a rustling in the wood hard by, and at the\nsame moment Denys sprang into the wood, and his crossbow went to his\nshoulder, even as he jumped. Twang! went the metal string; and after an\ninstant's suspense he roared, \"Run forward, guard the road, he is hit!\nhe is hit!\"\n\nGerard darted forward, and as he ran a young bear burst out of the wood\nright upon him; finding itself intercepted, it went upon its hind legs\nwith a snarl, and though not half grown, opened formidable jaws and long\nclaws. Gerard, in a fury of excitement and agitation, flung himself on\nit, and delivered a tremendous blow on its nose with his axe, and the\ncreature staggered; another, and it lay grovelling, with Gerard hacking\nit.\n\n\"Hallo! stop! you are mad to spoil the meat.\"\n\n\"I took it for a robber,\" said Gerard, panting. \"I mean, I had made\nready for a robber, so I could not hold my hand.\"\n\n\"Ay, these chattering travellers have stuffed your head full of thieves\nand assassins; they have not got a real live robber in their whole\nnation. Nay, I'll carry the beast; bear thou my crossbow.\"\n\n\"We will carry it by turns, then,\" said Gerard, \"for 'tis a heavy load:\npoor thing, how its blood drips. Why did we slay it?\"\n\n\"For supper and the reward the baillie of the next town shall give us.\"\n\n\"And for that it must die, when it had but just begun to live; and\nperchance it hath a mother that will miss it sore this night, and loves\nit as ours love us; more than mine does me.\"\n\n\"What, know you not that his mother was caught in a pitfall last month,\nand her skin is now at the tanner's? and his father was stuck full of\ncloth-yard shafts t'other day, and died like Julius Caesar, with his\nhands folded on his bosom, and a dead dog in each of them?\"\n\nBut Gerard would not view it jestingly. \"Why, then,\" said he, \"we have\nkilled one of God's creatures that was all alone in the world-as I am\nthis day, in this strange land.\"\n\n\"You young milksop,\" roared Denys, \"these things must not be looked\nat so, or not another bow would be drawn nor quarrel fly in forest nor\nbattlefield. Why, one of your kidney consorting with a troop of pikemen\nshould turn them to a row of milk-pails; it is ended, to Rome thou goest\nnot alone, for never wouldst thou reach the Alps in a whole skin. I take\nthee to Remiremont, my native place, and there I marry thee to my young\nsister, she is blooming as a peach. Thou shakest thy head? ah! I forgot;\nthou lovest elsewhere, and art a one woman man, a creature to me scarce\nconceivable. Well then I shall find thee, not a wife, nor a leman, but\na friend; some honest Burgundian who shall go with thee as far as Lyons;\nand much I doubt that honest fellow will be myself, into whose liquor\nthou has dropped sundry powders to make me love thee; for erst I endured\nnot doves in doublet and hose. From Lyons, I say, I can trust thee\nby ship to Italy, which being by all accounts the very stronghold of\nmilksops, thou wilt there be safe: they will hear thy words, and make\nthee their duke in a twinkling.\"\n\nGerard sighed. \"In sooth I love not to think of this Dusseldorf, where\nwe are to part company, good friend.\"\n\nThey walked silently, each thinking of the separation at hand; the\nthought checked trifling conversation, and at these moments it is a\nrelief to do something, however insignificant. Gerard asked Denys to\nlend him a bolt. \"I have often shot with a long bow, but never with one\nof these!\"\n\n\"Draw thy knife and cut this one out of the cub,\" said Denys slily.\n\n\"Nay, Day, I want a clean one.\"\n\nDenys gave him three out of his quiver.\n\nGerard strung the bow, and levelled it at a bough that had fallen into\nthe road at some distance. The power of the instrument surprised him;\nthe short but thick steel bow jarred him to the very heel as it went\noff, and the swift steel shaft was invisible in its passage; only the\ndead leaves, with which November had carpeted the narrow road, flew\nabout on the other side of the bough.\n\n\"Ye aimed a thought too high,\" said Denys.\n\n\"What a deadly thing! no wonder it is driving out the longbow--to\nMartin's much discontent.\"\n\n\"Ay, lad,\" said Denys triumphantly, \"it gains ground every day, in spite\nof their laws and their proclamations to keep up the yewen bow, because\nforsooth their grandsires shot with it, knowing no better. You see,\nGerard, war is not pastime. Men will shoot at their enemies with the\nhittingest arm and the killingest, not with the longest and missingest.\"\n\n\"Then these new engines I hear of will put both bows down; for these\nwith a pinch of black dust, and a leaden ball, and a child's finger,\nshall slay you Mars and Goliath, and the Seven Champions.\"\n\n\"Pooh! pooh!\" said Denys warmly; \"petrone nor harquebuss shall ever put\ndown Sir Arbalest. Why, we can shoot ten times while they are putting\ntheir charcoal and their lead into their leathern smoke belchers, and\nthen kindling their matches. All that is too fumbling for the field of\nbattle; there a soldier's weapon needs be aye ready, like his heart.\"\n\nGerard did not answer, for his ear was attracted by a sound behind\nthem. It was a peculiar sound, too, like something heavy, but not hard,\nrushing softly over the dead leaves. He turned round with some little\ncuriosity. A colossal creature was coming down the road at about sixty\npaces' distance.\n\nHe looked at it in a sort of calm stupor at first, but the next moment,\nhe turned ashy pale.\n\n\"Denys!\" he cried. \"Oh, God! Denys!\"\n\nDenys whirled round.\n\nIt was a bear as big as a cart-horse.\n\nIt was tearing along with its huge head down, running on a hot scent.\n\nThe very moment he saw it Denys said in a sickening whisper--\n\n\"THE CUB!\"\n\nOh! the concentrated horror of that one word, whispered hoarsely, with\ndilating eyes! For in that syllable it all flashed upon them both like\na sudden stroke of lightning in the dark--the bloody trail, the murdered\ncub, the mother upon them, and it. DEATH.\n\nAll this in a moment of time. The next, she saw them. Huge as she was,\nshe seemed to double herself (it was her long hair bristling with rage):\nshe raised her head big as a hull's, her swine-shaped jaws opened wide\nat them, her eyes turned to blood and flame, and she rushed upon them,\nscattering the leaves about her like a whirlwind as she came.\n\n\"Shoot!\" screamed Denys, but Gerard stood shaking from head to foot,\nuseless.\n\n\"Shoot, man! ten thousand devils, shoot! too late! Tree! tree!\" and he\ndropped the cub, pushed Gerard across the road, and flew to the first\ntree and climbed it, Gerard the same on his side; and as they fled, both\nmen uttered inhuman howls like savage creatures grazed by death.\n\nWith all their speed one or other would have been torn to fragments at\nthe foot of his tree; but the bear stopped a moment at the cub.\n\nWithout taking her bloodshot eyes off those she was hunting, she smelt\nit all round, and found, how, her Creator only knows, that it was dead,\nquite dead. She gave a yell such as neither of the hunted ones had ever\nheard, nor dreamed to be in nature, and flew after Denys. She reared and\nstruck at him as he climbed. He was just out of reach.\n\nInstantly she seized the tree, and with her huge teeth tore a great\npiece out of it with a crash. Then she reared again, dug her claws deep\ninto the bark, and began to mount it slowly, but as surely as a monkey.\n\nDenys's evil star had led him to a dead tree, a mere shaft, and of no\nvery great height. He climbed faster than his pursuer, and was soon at\nthe top. He looked this way and that for some bough of another tree to\nspring to. There was none; and if he jumped down, he knew the bear would\nbe upon him ere he could recover the fall, and make short work of him.\nMoreover, Denys was little used to turning his back on danger, and his\nblood was rising at being hunted. He turned to bay.\n\n\"My hour is come,\" thought he. \"Let me meet death like a man.\" He\nkneeled down and grasped a small shoot to steady himself, drew his long\nknife, and clenching his teeth, prepared to jab the huge brute as soon\nas it should mount within reach.\n\nOf this combat the result was not doubtful.\n\nThe monster's head and neck were scarce vulnerable for bone and masses\nof hair. The man was going to sting the bear, and the bear to crack the\nman like a nut.\n\nGerard's heart was better than his nerves. He saw his friend's mortal\ndanger, and passed at once from fear to blindish rage. He slipped down\nhis tree in a moment, caught up the crossbow, which he had dropped in\nthe road, and running furiously up, sent a bolt into the bear's body\nwith a loud shout. The bear gave a snarl of rage and pain, and turned\nits head irresolutely.\n\n\"Keep aloof!\" cried Denys, \"or you are a dead man.\"\n\n\"I care not;\" and in a moment he had another bolt ready and shot it\nfiercely into the bear, screaming, \"Take that! take that!\"\n\nDenys poured a volley of oaths down at him. \"Get away, idiot!\"\n\nHe was right: the bear finding so formidable and noisy a foe behind\nher, slipped growling down the tree, rending deep furrows in it as she\nslipped. Gerard ran back to his tree and climbed it swiftly. But while\nhis legs were dangling some eight feet from the ground, the bear came\nrearing and struck with her fore paw, and out flew a piece of bloody\ncloth from Gerard's hose. He climbed, and climbed; and presently he\nheard as it were in the air a voice say, \"Go out on the bough!\" He\nlooked, and there was a long massive branch before him shooting upwards\nat a slight angle: he threw his body across it, and by a series of\nconvulsive efforts worked up it to the end.\n\nThen he looked round panting.\n\nThe bear was mounting the tree on the other side. He heard her claws\nscrape, and saw her bulge on both sides of the massive tree. Her eye not\nbeing very quick, she reached the fork and passed it, mounting the main\nstem. Gerard drew breath more freely. The bear either heard him, or\nfound by scent she was wrong: she paused; presently she caught sight of\nhim. She eyed him steadily, then quietly descended to the fork.\n\nSlowly and cautiously she stretched out a paw and tried the bough. It\nwas a stiff oak branch, sound as iron. Instinct taught the creature\nthis: it crawled carefully out on the bough, growling savagely as it\ncame.\n\nGerard looked wildly down. He was forty feet from the ground. Death\nbelow. Death moving slow but sure on him in a still more horrible\nform. His hair bristled. The sweat poured from him. He sat helpless,\nfascinated, tongue-tied.\n\nAs the fearful monster crawled growling towards him, incongruous\nthoughts coursed through his mind. Margaret: the Vulgate, where it\nspeaks of the rage of a she-bear robbed of her whelps--Rome--Eternity.\n\nThe bear crawled on. And now the stupor of death fell on the doomed man;\nhe saw the open jaws and bloodshot eyes coming, but in a mist.\n\nAs in a mist he heard a twang; he glanced down; Denys, white and silent\nas death, was shooting up at the bear. The bear snarled at the twang.\nbut crawled on. Again the crossbow twanged, and the bear snarled, and\ncame nearer. Again the cross bow twanged; and the next moment the bear\nwas close upon Gerard, where he sat, with hair standing stiff on end and\neyes starting from their sockets, palsied. The bear opened her jaws like\na grave, and hot blood spouted from them upon Gerard as from a pump. The\nbough rocked. The wounded monster was reeling; it clung, it stuck its\nsickles of claws deep into the wood; it toppled, its claws held firm,\nbut its body rolled off, and the sudden shock to the branch shook Gerard\nforward on his stomach with his face upon one of the bear's straining\npaws. At this, by a convulsive effort, she raised her head up, up, till\nhe felt her hot fetid breath. Then huge teeth snapped together loudly\nclose below him in the air, with a last effort of baffled hate. The\nponderous carcass rent the claws out of the bough, then pounded the\nearth with a tremendous thump. There was a shout of triumph below,\nand the very next instant a cry of dismay, for Gerard had swooned, and\nwithout an attempt to save himself, rolled headlong from the perilous\nheight.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nDenys caught at Gerard, and somewhat checked his fall; but it may be\ndoubted whether this alone would have saved him from breaking his\nneck, or a limb. His best friend now was the dying bear, on whose hairy\ncarcass his head and shoulders descended. Denys tore him off her. It was\nneedless. She panted still, and her limbs quivered, but a hare was not\nso harmless; and soon she breathed her last; and the judicious Denys\npropped Gerard up against her, being soft, and fanned him. He came to\nby degrees, but confused, and feeling the bear around him, rolled away,\nyelling.\n\n\"Courage,\" cried Denys, \"le diable est mort.\"\n\n\"Is it dead? quite dead?\" inquired Gerard from behind a tree; for his\ncourage was feverish, and the cold fit was on him just now, and had been\nfor some time.\n\n\"Behold,\" said Denys, and pulled the brute's ear playfully, and opened\nher jaws and put in his head, with other insulting antics; in the midst\nof which Gerard was violently sick.\n\nDenys laughed at him.\n\n\"What is the matter now?\" said he, \"also, why tumble off your perch just\nwhen we had won the day?\"\n\n\"I swooned, I trow.\"\n\n\"But why?\"\n\nNot receiving an answer, he continued, \"Green girls faint as soon\nas look at you, but then they choose time and place. What woman ever\nfainted up a tree?\"\n\n\"She sent her nasty blood all over me. I think the smell must have\noverpowered me! Faugh! I hate blood.\"\n\n\"I do believe it potently.\"\n\n\"See what a mess she has made me\n\n\"But with her blood, not yours. I pity the enemy that strives to satisfy\nyou.\"'\n\n\"You need not to brag, Maitre Denys; I saw you under the tree, the\ncolour of your shirt.\"\n\n\"Let us distinguish,\" said Denys, colouring; \"it is permitted to tremble\nfor a friend.\"\n\nGerard, for answer, flung his arms round Denys's neck in silence.\n\n\"Look here,\" whined the stout soldier, affected by this little gush of\nnature and youth, \"was ever aught so like a woman? I love thee, little\nmilksop--go to. Good! behold him on his knees now. What new caprice is\nthis?\"\n\n\"Oh, Denys, ought we not to return thanks to Him who has saved both our\nlives against such fearful odds?\" And Gerard kneeled, and prayed aloud.\nAnd presently he found Denys kneeling quiet beside him, with his hands\nacross his bosom after the custom of his nation, and a face as long as\nhis arm. When they rose, Gerard's countenance was beaming.\n\n\"Good Denys,\" said he, \"Heaven will reward thy piety.\"\n\n\"Ah, bah! I did it out of politeness,\" said the Frenchman. \"It was to\nplease thee, little one. C'est egal, 'twas well and orderly prayed, and\nedified me to the core while it lasted. A bishop had scarce handled the\nmatter better; so now our evensong being sung, and the saints enlisted\nwith us--marchons.\"\n\nEre they had taken two steps, he stopped. \"By-the-by, the cub!\"\n\n\"Oh, no, no!\" cried Gerard.\n\n\"You are right. It is late. We have lost time climbing trees, and\ntumbling off 'em, and swooning, and vomiting, and praying; and the brute\nis heavy to carry. And now I think on't, we shall have papa after it\nnext; these bears make such a coil about an odd cub. What is this? you\nare wounded! you are wounded!\"\n\n\"Not I.\"\n\n\"He is wounded; miserable that I am!\"\n\n\"Be calm, Denys. I am not touched; I feel no pain anywhere.\"\n\n\"You? you only feel when another is hurt,\" cried Denys, with great\nemotion; and throwing himself on his knees, he examined Gerard's leg\nwith glistening eyes.\n\n\"Quick! quick! before it stiffens,\" he cried, and hurried him on.\n\n\"Who makes the coil about nothing now?\" inquired Gerard composedly.\n\nDenys's reply was a very indirect one.\n\n\"Be pleased to note,\" said he, \"that I have a bad heart. You were man\nenough to save my life, yet I must sneer at you, a novice in war. Was\nnot I a novice once myself? Then you fainted from a wound, and I thought\nyou swooned for fear, and called you a milksop. Briefly, I have a bad\ntongue and a bad heart.\"\n\n\"Denys!\"\n\n\"Plait-il?\"\n\n\"You lie.\"\n\n\"You are very good to say so, little one, and I am eternally obliged to\nyou,\" mumbled the remorseful Denys.\n\nEre they had walked many furlongs, the muscles of the wounded leg\ncontracted and stiffened, till presently Gerard could only just put his\ntoe to the ground, and that with great pain.\n\nAt last he could bear it no longer.\n\n\"Let me lie down and die,\" he groaned, \"for this is intolerable.\"\n\nDenys represented that it was afternoon, and the nights were now frosty;\nand cold and hunger ill companions; and that it would be unreasonable\nto lose heart, a certain great personage being notoriously defunct. So\nGerard leaned upon his axe, and hobbled on; but presently he gave in,\nall of a sudden, and sank helpless in the road.\n\nDenys drew him aside into the wood, and to his surprise gave him his\ncrossbow and bolts, enjoining him strictly to lie quiet, and if any\nill-looking fellows should find him out and come to him, to bid them\nkeep aloof; and should they refuse, to shoot them dead at twenty paces.\n\"Honest men keep the path; and, knaves in a wood, none but fools do\nparley with them.\" With this he snatched up Gerard's axe, and set off\nrunning--not, as Gerard expected, towards Dusseldorf, but on the road\nthey had come.\n\nGerard lay aching and smarting; and to him Rome, that seemed so near at\nstarting, looked far, far off, now that he was two hundred miles nearer\nit. But soon all his thoughts turned Sevenbergen-wards. How sweet it\nwould be one day to hold Margaret's hand, and tell her all he had gone\nthrough for her! The very thought of it, and her, soothed him; and in\nthe midst of pain and irritation of the nerves be lay resigned, and\nsweetly, though faintly, smiling.\n\nHe had lain thus more than two hours, when suddenly there were shouts;\nand the next moment something struck a tree hard by, and quivered in it.\n\nHe looked, it was an arrow.\n\nHe started to his feet. Several missiles rattled among the boughs, and\nthe wood echoed with battle-cries. Whence they came he could not tell,\nfor noises in these huge woods are so reverberated, that a stranger\nis always at fault as to their whereabout; but they seemed to fill\nthe whole air. Presently there was a lull; then he heard the fierce\ngalloping of hoofs; and still louder shouts and cries arose, mingled\nwith shrieks and groans; and above all, strange and terrible sounds,\nlike fierce claps of thunder, bellowing loud, and then dying off in\ncracking echoes; and red tongues of flame shot out ever and anon among\nthe trees, and clouds of sulphurous smoke came drifting over his head.\nAnd all was still.\n\nGerard was struck with awe. \"What will become of Denys?\" he cried. \"Oh,\nwhy did you leave me? Oh, Denys, my friend! my friend!\"\n\nJust before sunset Denys returned, almost sinking under a hairy bundle.\nIt was the bear's skin.\n\nGerard welcomed him with a burst of joy that astonished him.\n\n\"I thought never to see you again, dear Denys. Were you in the battle?\"\n\n\"No. What battle?\"\n\n\"The bloody battle of men, or fiends, that raged in the wood a while\nagone;\" and with this he described it to the life, and more fully than I\nhave done.\n\nDenys patted him indulgently on the back.\n\n\"It is well,\" said he; \"thou art a good limner; and fever is a great\nspur to the imagination. One day I lay in a cart-shed with a cracked\nskull, and saw two hosts manoeuvre and fight a good hour on eight feet\nsquare, the which I did fairly describe to my comrade in due order, only\nnot so gorgeously as thou, for want of book learning.\n\n\"What, then, you believe me not? when I tell you the arrows whizzed over\nmy head, and the combatants shouted, and--\"\n\n\"May the foul fiends fly away with me if I believe a word of it.\"\n\nGerard took his arm, and quietly pointed to a tree close by.\n\n\"Why, it looks like--it is-a broad arrow, as I live!\" And he went close,\nand looked up at it.\n\n\"It came out of the battle. I heard it, and saw it.\"\n\n\"An English arrow.\"\n\n\"How know you that?\"\n\n\"Marry, by its length. The English bowmen draw the bow to the ear,\nothers only to the right breast. Hence the English loose a three-foot\nshaft, and this is one of them, perdition seize them! Well, if this is\nnot glamour, there has been a trifle of a battle. And if there has been\na battle in so ridiculous a place for a battle as this, why then 'tis\nno business of mine, for my Duke hath no quarrel hereabouts. So let's to\nbed,\" said the professional. And with this he scraped together a heap of\nleaves, and made Gerard lie on it, his axe by his side. He then lay down\nbeside him, with one hand on his arbalest, and drew the bear-skin over\nthem, hair inward. They were soon as warm as toast, and fast asleep.\n\nBut long before the dawn Gerard woke his comrade.\n\n\"What shall I do, Denys, I die of famine?\"\n\n\"Do? why, go to sleep again incontinent: qui dort dine.\"\n\n\"But I tell you I am too hungry to sleep,\" snapped Gerard.\n\n\"Let us march, then,\" replied Denys, with paternal indulgence.\n\nHe had a brief paroxysm of yawns; then made a small bundle of bears'\nears, rolling them up in a strip of the skin, cut for the purpose; and\nthey took the road.\n\nGerard leaned on his axe, and propped by Denys on the other side,\nhobbled along, not without sighs.\n\n\"I hate pain.\" said Gerard viciously.\n\n\"Therein you show judgment,\" replied papa smoothly.\n\nIt was a clear starlight night; and soon the moon rising revealed the\nend of the wood at no great distance: a pleasant sight, since Dusseldorf\nthey knew was but a short league further.\n\nAt the edge of the wood they came upon something so mysterious that they\nstopped to gaze at it, before going up to it. Two white pillars rose\nin the air, distant a few paces from each other; and between them stood\nmany figures, that looked like human forms.\n\n\"I go no farther till I know what this is,\" said Gerard, in an agitated\nwhisper. \"Are they effigies of the saints, for men to pray to on the\nroad? or live robbers waiting to shoot down honest travellers? Nay,\nliving men they cannot be, for they stand on nothing that I see. Oh!\nDenys, let us turn back till daybreak; this is no mortal sight.\"\n\nDenys halted, and peered long and keenly. \"They are men,\" said he, at\nlast. Gerard was for turning back all the more. \"But men that will never\nhurt us, nor we them. Look not to their feet, for that they stand on!\"\n\n\"Where, then, i' the name of all the saints?\"\n\n\"Look over their heads,\" said Denys gravely.\n\nFollowing this direction, Gerard presently discerned the outline of\na dark wooden beam passing from pillar to pillar; and as the pair got\nnearer, walking now on tiptoe, one by one dark snake-like cords came out\nin the moonlight, each pendent from the beam to a dead man, and tight as\nwire.\n\nNow as they came under this awful monument of crime and wholesale\nvengeance a light air swept by, and several of the corpses swung, or\ngently gyrated, and every rope creaked. Gerard shuddered at this ghastly\nsalute. So thoroughly had the gibbet, with its sickening load, seized\nand held their eyes, that it was but now they perceived a fire right\nunderneath, and a living figure sitting huddled over it. His axe lay\nbeside him, the bright blade shining red in the glow. He was asleep.\n\nGerard started, but Denys only whispered, \"courage, comrade, here is a\nfire.\"\n\n\"Ay! but there is a man at it.\"\n\n\"There will soon be three;\" and he began to heap some wood on it that\nthe watcher had prepared; during which the prudent Gerard seized the\nman's axe, and sat down tight on it, grasping his own, and examining the\nsleeper. There was nothing outwardly distinctive in the man. He wore the\ndress of the country folk, and the hat of the district, a three-cornered\nhat called a Brunswicker, stiff enough to turn a sword cut, and with a\nthick brass hat-band. The weight of the whole thing had turned his ears\nentirely down, like a fancy rabbit's in our century; but even this,\nthough it spoiled him as a man, was nothing remarkable. They had of late\nmet scores of these dog's-eared rustics. The peculiarity was, this clown\nwatching under a laden gallows. What for?\n\nDenys, if he felt curious, would not show it; he took out two bears'\nears from his bundle, and running sticks through them, began to toast\nthem. \"'Twill be eating coined money,\" said he; \"for the burgomaster\nof Dusseldorf had given us a rix-dollar for these ears, as proving the\ndeath of their owners; but better a lean purse than a lere stomach.\"\n\n\"Unhappy man!\" cried Gerard, \"could you eat food here?\"\n\n\"Where the fire is lighted there must the meat roast, and where it\nroasts there must it be eaten; for nought travels worse than your\nroasted meat.\"\n\n\"Well, eat thou, Denys, an thou canst! but I am cold and sick; there is\nno room for hunger in my heart after what mine eyes have seen,\" and he\nshuddered over the fire. \"Oh! how they creak! and who is this man, I\nwonder? what an ill-favoured churl!\"\n\nDenys examined him like a connoisseur looking at a picture, and in\ndue course delivered judgment. \"I take him to be of the refuse of that\ncompany, whereof these (pointing carelessly upward) were the cream, and\nso ran their heads into danger.\n\n\"At that rate, why not stun him before he wakes?\" and Gerard fidgeted\nwhere he sat.\n\nDenys opened his eyes with humorous surprise. \"For one who sets up for\na milksop you have the readiest hand. Why should two stun one? tush! he\nwakes: note now what he says at waking, and tell me.\"\n\nThese last words were hardly whispered when the watcher opened his eyes.\nAt sight of the fire made up, and two strangers eyeing him keenly, he\nstared, and there was a severe and pretty successful effort to be calm;\nstill a perceptible tremor ran all over him. Soon he manned himself,\nand said gruffly. \"Good morrow. But at the very moment of saying it he\nmissed his axe, and saw how Gerard was sitting upon it, with his own\nlaid ready to his hand. He lost countenance again directly. Denys smiled\ngrimly at this bit of byplay.\n\n\"Good morrow!\" said Gerard quietly, keeping his eye on him.\n\nThe watcher was now too ill at ease to be silent. \"You make free with\nmy fire,\" said he; but he added in a somewhat faltering voice, \"you are\nwelcome.\"\n\nDenys whispered Gerard. The watcher eyed them askant.\n\n\"My comrade says, sith we share your fire, you shall share his meat.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" said the man warmly. \"I have half a kid hanging on a bush\nhard by, I'll go fetch it;\" and he arose with a cheerful and obliging\ncountenance, and was retiring.\n\nDenys caught up his crossbow, and levelled it at his head. The man fell\non his knees.\n\nDenys lowered his weapon, and pointed him back to his place. He rose and\nwent back slowly and unsteadily, like one disjointed; and sick at heart\nas the mouse, that the cat lets go a little way, and then darts and\nreplaces.\n\n\"Sit down, friend,\" said Denys grimly, in French.\n\nThe man obeyed finger and tone, though he knew not a word of French.\n\n\"Tell him the fire is not big enough for more than thee. He will take my\nmeaning.\"\n\nThis being communicated by Gerard, the man grinned; ever since Denys\nspoke he had seemed greatly relieved. \"I wist not ye were strangers,\"\nsaid he to Gerard.\n\nDenys cut a piece of bear's ear, and offered it with grace to him he had\njust levelled crossbow at.\n\nHe took it calmly, and drew a piece of bread from his wallet, and\ndivided it with the pair. Nay, more, he winked and thrust his hand into\nthe heap of leaves he sat on (Gerard grasped his axe ready to brain him)\nand produced a leathern bottle holding full two gallons. He put it to\nhis mouth, and drank their healths, then handed it to Gerard; he passed\nit untouched to Denys.\n\n\"Mort de ma vie!\" cried the soldier, \"it is Rhenish wine, and fit\nfor the gullet of an archbishop. Here's to thee, thou prince of good\nfellows, wishing thee a short life and a merry one! Come, Gerard, sup!\nsup! Pshaw, never heed them, man! they heed not thee. Natheless, did I\nhang over such a skin of Rhenish as this, and three churls sat beneath a\ndrinking it and offered me not a drop, I'd soon be down among them.\"\n\n\"Denys! Denys!\"\n\n\"My spirit would cut the cord, and womp would come my body amongst ye,\nwith a hand on the bottle, and one eye winking, t'other.\"\n\nGerard started up with a cry of horror and his fingers to his ears, and\nwas running from the place, when his eye fell on the watcher's axe. The\ntangible danger brought him back. He sat down again on the axe with his\nfingers in his ears.\n\n\"Courage, l'ami, le diable est mort!\" shouted Denys gaily, and offered\nhim a piece of bear's ear, put it right under his nose as he stopped his\nears. Gerard turned his head away with loathing.\n\n\"Wine!\" he gasped. \"Heaven knows I have much need of it, with such\ncompanions as thee and--\"\n\nHe took a long draught of the Rhenish wine: it ran glowing through his\nveins, and warmed and strengthened his heart, but could not check his\ntremors whenever a gust of wind came. As for Denys and the other, they\nfeasted recklessly, and plied the bottle unceasingly, and drank healths\nand caroused beneath that creaking sepulchre and its ghastly tenants.\n\n\"Ask him how they came here,\" said Denys, with his mouth full, and\npointing up without looking.\n\nOn this question being interpreted to the watcher, he replied that\ntreason had been their end, diabolical treason and priest-craft. He\nthen, being rendered communicative by drink, delivered a long prosy\nnarrative, the purport of which was as follows. These honest gentlemen\nwho now dangled here so miserably were all stout men and true, and\nlived in the forest by their wits. Their independence and thriving state\nexcited the jealousy and hatred of a large portion of mankind, and many\nattempts were made on their lives and liberties; these the Virgin and\ntheir patron saints, coupled with their individual skill and courage\nconstantly baffled. But yester eve a party of merchants came slowly on\ntheir mules from Dusseldorf. The honest men saw them crawling, and let\nthem penetrate near a league into the forest, then set upon them to\nmake them disgorge a portion of their ill-gotten gains. But alas!\nthe merchants were no merchants at all, but soldiers of more than one\nnation, in the pay of the Archbishop of Cologne; haubergeons had they\nbeneath their gowns, and weapons of all sorts at hand; natheless, the\nhonest men fought stoutly, and pressed the traitors hard, when lo!\nhorsemen, that had been planted in ambush many hours before, galloped\nup, and with these new diabolical engines of war, shot leaden bullets,\nand laid many an honest fellow low, and so quelled the courage of others\nthat they yielded them prisoners. These being taken red-handed, the\nvictors, who with malice inconceivable had brought cords knotted round\ntheir waists, did speedily hang, and by their side the dead ones, to\nmake the gallanter show. \"That one at the end was the captain. He never\nfelt the cord. He was riddled with broad arrows and leaden balls or ever\nthey could take him: a worthy man as ever cried, 'Stand and deliver!'\nbut a little hasty, not much: stay! I forgot; he is dead. Very hasty,\nand obstinate as a pig. That one in the--buff jerkin is the lieutenant,\nas good a soul as ever lived: he was hanged alive. This one here, I\nnever could abide; no (not that one; that is Conrad, my bosom friend); I\nmean this one right overhead in the chicken-toed shoon; you were always\ncarrying tales, ye thief, and making mischief; you know you were; and,\nsirs, I am a man that would rather live united in a coppice than in a\nforest with backbiters and tale-bearers: strangers, I drink to you.\"\nAnd so he went down the whole string, indicating with the neck of the\nbottle, like a showman with his pole, and giving a neat description of\neach, which though pithy was invariably false; for the showman had no\nreal eye for character, and had misunderstood every one of these people.\n\n\"Enough palaver!\" cried Denys. \"Marchons! Give me his axe: now tell him\nhe must help you along.\"\n\nThe man's countenance fell, but he saw in Denys's eye that resistance\nwould be dangerous; he submitted. Gerard it was who objected. He said,\n\"Y pensez-vous? to put my hand on a thief, it maketh my flesh creep.\"\n\n\"Childishness! all trades must live. Besides, I have my reasons. Be not\nyou wiser than your elder.\"\n\n\"No. Only if I am to lean on him I must have my hand in my bosom, still\ngrasping the haft of my knife.\"\n\n\"It is a new attitude to walk in; but please thyself.\"\n\nAnd in that strange and mixed attitude of tender offices and deadly\nsuspicion the trio did walk. I wish I could draw them--I would not trust\nto the pen.\n\nThe light of the watch-tower at Dusseldorf was visible as soon as they\ncleared the wood, and cheered Gerard. When, after an hour's march, the\nblack outline of the tower itself and other buildings stood out clear to\nthe eye, their companion halted and said gloomily, \"You may as well slay\nme out of hand as take me any nearer the gates of Dusseldorf town.\"\n\nOn this being communicated to Denys, he said at once, \"Let him go then,\nfor in sooth his neck will be in jeopardy if he wends much further with\nus.\" Gerard acquiesced as a matter of course. His horror of a criminal\ndid not in the least dispose him to active co-operation with the law.\nBut the fact is, that at this epoch no private citizen in any part\nof Europe ever meddled with criminals but in self-defence, except,\nby-the-by, in England, which, behind other nations in some things, was\ncenturies before them all in this.\n\nThe man's personal liberty being restored, he asked for his axe. It was\ngiven him. To the friends' surprise he still lingered. Was he to have\nnothing for coming so far out of his way with them?\n\n\"Here are two batzen, friend.\n\n\"Add the wine, the good Rhenish?\"\n\n\"Did you give aught for it?\"\n\n\"Ay! the peril of my life.\"\n\n\"Hum! what say you, Denys?\"\n\n\"I say it was worth its weight in gold. Here, lad, here be silver\ngroshen, one for every acorn on that gallows tree; and here is one more\nfor thee, who wilt doubtless be there in due season.\"\n\nThe man took the coins, but still lingered.\n\n\"Well! what now?\" cried Gerard, who thought him shamefully overpaid\nalready. \"Dost seek the hide off our bones?\"\n\n\"Nay, good sirs, but you have seen to-night how parlous a life is mine.\nYe be true men, and your prayers avail; give me then a small trifle of a\nprayer, an't please you; for I know not one.\"\n\nGerard's choler began to rise at the egotistical rogue; moreover, ever\nsince his wound he had felt gusts of irritability. However, he bit his\nlip and said, \"There go two words to that bargain; tell me first, is it\ntrue what men say of you Rhenish thieves, that ye do murder innocent and\nunresisting travellers as well as rob them?\"\n\nThe other answered sulkily, \"They you call thieves are not to blame for\nthat; the fault lies with the law.\"\n\n\"Gramercy! so 'tis the law's fault that ill men break it?\"\n\n\"I mean not so; but the law in this land slays an honest man an if he\ndo but steal. What follows? he would be pitiful, but is discouraged\nherefrom; pity gains him no pity, and doubles his peril: an he but cut\na purse his life is forfeit; therefore cutteth he the throat to boot, to\nsave his own neck: dead men tell no tales. Pray then for the poor soul\nwho by bloody laws is driven to kill or else be slaughtered; were there\nless of this unreasonable gibbeting on the highroad, there should be\nless enforced cutting of throats in dark woods, my masters.\"\n\n\"Fewer words had served,\" replied Gerard coldly. \"I asked a question, I\nam answered,\" and suddenly doffing his bonnet--\n\n\"'Obsecro Deum omnipotentem, ut, qua cruce jam pendent isti quindecim\nlatrones fures et homicidae, in ea homicida fur et latro tu pependeris\nquam citissime, pro publica salute, in honorem justi Dei cui sit gloria,\nin aeternum, Amen.'\"\n\n\"And so good day.\"\n\nThe greedy outlaw was satisfied last. \"That is Latin,\" he muttered, \"and\nmore than I bargained for.\" So indeed it was.\n\nAnd he returned to his business with a mind at ease. The friends\npondered in silence the many events of the last few hours.\n\nAt last Gerard said thoughtfully, \"That she-bear saved both our lives-by\nGod's will.\"\n\n\"Like enough,\" replied Denys; \"and talking of that, it was lucky we did\nnot dawdle over our supper.\"\n\n\"What mean you?\"\n\n\"I mean they are not all hanged; I saw a refuse of seven or eight as\nblack as ink around our fire.\"\n\n\"When? when?\"\n\n\"Ere we had left it five minutes.\"\n\n\"Good heavens! and you said not a word.\"\n\n\"It would but have worried you, and had set our friend a looking back,\nand mayhap tempted him to get his skull split. All other danger was\nover; they could not see us, we were out of the moonshine, and indeed,\njust turning a corner. Ah! there is the sun; and here are the gates of\nDusseldorf. Courage, l'ami, le diable est mort!\"\n\n\"My head! my head!\" was all poor Gerard could reply.\n\nSo many shocks, emotions, perils, horrors, added to the wound, his\nfirst, had tried his youthful body and sensitive nature too severely.\n\n\nIt was noon of the same day.\n\nIn a bedroom of \"The Silver Lion\" the rugged Denys sat anxious, watching\nhis young friend.\n\nAnd he lay raging with fever, delirious at intervals, and one word for\never on his lips.\n\n\"Margaret!--Margaret Margaret!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nIt was the afternoon of the next day. Gerard was no longer lightheaded,\nbut very irritable and full of fancies; and in one of these he begged\nDenys to get him a lemon to suck. Denys, who from a rough soldier had\nbeen turned by tender friendship into a kind of grandfather, got up\nhastily, and bidding him set his mind at ease, \"lemons he should have in\nthe twinkling of a quart pot,\" went and ransacked the shops for them.\n\nThey were not so common in the North as they are now, and he was absent\na long while, and Gerard getting very impatient, when at last the door\nopened. But it was not Denys. Entered softly an imposing figure; an old\ngentleman in a long sober gown trimmed with rich fur, cherry-coloured\nhose, and pointed shoes, with a sword by his side in a morocco scabbard,\na ruff round his neck not only starched severely, but treacherously\nstiffened in furrows by rebatoes, or a little hidden framework of wood;\nand on his head a four-cornered cap with a fur border; on his chin and\nbosom a majestic white beard. Gerard was in no doubt as to the vocation\nof his visitor, for, the sword excepted, this was familiar to him as the\nfull dress of a physician. Moreover, a boy followed at his heels with\na basket, where phials, lint, and surgical tools rather courted than\nshunned observation. The old gentleman came softly to the bedside, and\nsaid mildly and sotto voce, \"How is't with thee, my son?\"\n\nGerard answered gratefully that his wound gave him little pain now; but\nhis throat was parched, and his head heavy.\n\n\"A wound! they told me not of that. Let me see it. Ay, ay, a good clean\nbite. The mastiff had sound teeth that took this out, I warrant me;\"\nand the good doctor's sympathy seemed to run off to the quadruped he had\nconjured, his jackal.\n\n\"This must be cauterized forthwith, or we shall have you starting back\nfrom water, and turning somersaults in bed under our hands. 'Tis the\nyear for raving curs, and one hath done your business; but we will\nbaffle him yet. Urchin, go heat thine iron.\"\n\n\"But, sir,\" edged in Gerard, \"'twas no dog, but a bear.\"\n\n\"A bear! Young man,\" remonstrated the senior severely, \"think what you\nsay; 'tis ill jesting with the man of art who brings his grey hairs and\nlong study to heal you. A bear, quotha! Had you dissected as many bears\nas I, or the tithe, and drawn their teeth to keep your hand in, you\nwould know that no bear's jaw ever made this foolish trifling wound. I\ntell you 'twas a dog, and since you put me to it, I even deny that it\nwas a dog of magnitude, but neither more nor less than one of these\nlittle furious curs that are so rife, and run devious, biting each manly\nleg, and laying its wearer low, but for me and my learned brethren, who\nstill stay the mischief with knife and cautery.\"\n\n\"Alas, sir! when said I 'twas a bear's jaw? I said, 'A bear:' it was his\npaw, now.\"\n\n\"And why didst not tell me that at once?\"\n\n\"Because you kept telling me instead.\"\n\n\"Never conceal aught from your leech, young man,\" continued the senior,\nwho was a good talker, but one of the worst listeners in Europe. \"Well,\nit is an ill business. All the horny excrescences of animals, to wit,\nclaws of tigers, panthers, badgers, cats, bears, and the like, and\nhorn of deer, and nails of humans, especially children, are imbued with\ndirest poison. Y'had better have been bitten by a cur, whatever you may\nsay, than gored by bull or stag, or scratched by bear. However, shalt\nhave a good biting cataplasm for thy leg; meantime keep we the\nbody cool: put out thy tongue!-good!-fever. Let me feel thy pulse:\ngood!--fever. I ordain flebotomy, and on the instant.\"\n\n\"Flebotomy! that is bloodletting: humph! Well, no matter, if 'tis sure\nto cure me, for I will not lie idle here.\" The doctor let him know that\nflebotomy was infallible, especially in this case.\n\n\"Hans, go fetch the things needful, and I will entertain the patient\nmeantime with reasons.\"\n\nThe man of art then explained to Gerard that in disease the blood\nbecomes hot and distempered and more or less poisonous; but a portion of\nthis unhealthy liquid removed, Nature is fain to create a purer fluid to\nfill its place. Bleeding, therefore, being both a cooler and a purifier,\nwas a specific in all diseases, for all diseases were febrile, whatever\nempirics might say.\n\n\"But think not,\" said he warmly, \"that it suffices to bleed; any paltry\nbarber can open a vein (though not all can close it again). The art is\nto know what vein to empty for what disease. T'other day they brought me\none tormented with earache. I let him blood in the right thigh, and away\nflew his earache. By-the-by, he has died since then. Another came with\nthe toothache. I bled him behind the ear, and relieved him in a jiffy.\nHe is also since dead as it happens. I bled our bailiff between the\nthumb and forefinger for rheumatism. Presently he comes to me with\na headache and drumming in the ears, and holds out his hand over the\nbasin; but I smiled at his folly, and bled him in the left ankle sore\nagainst his will, and made his head as light as a nut.\"\n\nDiverging then from the immediate theme after the manner of enthusiasts,\nthe reverend teacher proceeded thus:\n\n\"Know, young man, that two schools of art contend at this moment\nthroughout Europe. The Arabian, whose ancient oracles are Avicenna,\nRhazes, Albucazis; and its revivers are Chauliac and Lanfranc; and\nthe Greek school, whose modern champions are Bessarion, Platinus, and\nMarsilius Ficinus, but whose pristine doctors were medicine's very\noracles, Phoebus, Chiron, Aesculapius, and his sons Podalinus and\nMachaon, Pythagoras, Democritus, Praxagoras, who invented the arteries,\nand Dioctes, 'qui primus urinae animum dedit.' All these taught orally.\nThen came Hippocrates, the eighteenth from Aesculapius, and of him we\nhave manuscripts; to him we owe 'the vital principle.' He also invented\nthe bandage, and tapped for water on the chest; and above all he\ndissected; yet only quadrupeds, for the brutal prejudices of the pagan\nvulgar withheld the human body from the knife of science. Him followed\nAristotle, who gave us the aorta, the largest blood-vessel in the human\nbody.\"\n\n\"Surely, sir, the Almighty gave us all that is in our bodies, and not\nAristotle, nor any Grecian man,\" objected Gerard humbly.\n\n\"Child! of course He gave us the thing; but Aristotle did more, he gave\nus the name of the thing. But young men will still be talking. The\nnext great light was Galen; he studied at Alexandria, then the home\nof science. He, justly malcontent with quadrupeds, dissected apes, as\ncoming nearer to man, and bled like a Trojan. Then came Theophilus, who\ngave us the nerves, the lacteal vessels, and the pia mater.\"\n\nThis worried Gerard. \"I cannot lie still and hear it said that mortal\nman bestowed the parts which Adam our father took from Him, who made him\nof the clay, and us his sons.\"\n\n\"Was ever such perversity?\" said the doctor, his colour rising. \"Who is\nthe real donor of a thing to man? he who plants it secretly in the\ndark recesses of man's body, or the learned wight who reveals it to\nhis intelligence, and so enriches his mind with the knowledge of it?\nComprehension is your only true possession. Are you answered?\"\n\n\"I am put to silence, sir.\"\n\n\"And that is better still; for garrulous patients are ill to cure,\nespecially in fever; I say, then, that Eristratus gave us the cerebral\nnerves and the milk vessels; nay, more, he was the inventor of\nlithotomy, whatever you may say. Then came another whom I forget; you do\nsomewhat perturb me with your petty exceptions. Then came Ammonius, the\nauthor of lithotrity, and here comes Hans with the basin-to stay your\nvolubility. Blow thy chafer, boy, and hand me the basin; 'tis well.\nArabians, quotha! What are they but a sect of yesterday who about the\nyear 1000 did fall in with the writings of those very Greeks, and read\nthem awry, having no concurrent light of their own? for their demigod,\nand camel-driver, Mahound, impostor in science as in religion, had\nstrictly forbidden them anatomy, even of the lower animals, the which he\nwho severeth from medicine, 'tollit solem e mundo,' as Tully quoth. Nay,\nwonder not at my fervour, good youth; where the general weal stands in\njeopardy, a little warmth is civic, humane, and honourable. Now there is\nsettled of late in this town a pestilent Arabist, a mere empiric,\nwho, despising anatomy, and scarce knowing Greek from Hebrew, hath yet\nspirited away half my patients; and I tremble for the rest. Put forth\nthine ankle; and thou, Hans, breathe on the chafer.\"\n\nWhilst matters were in this posture, in came Denys with the lemons, and\nstood surprised. \"What sport is toward?\" said he, raising his brows.\n\nGerard coloured a little, and told him the learned doctor was going to\nflebotomize him and cauterize him; that was all.\n\n\"Ay! indeed; and yon imp, what bloweth he hot coals for?\"\n\n\"What should it be for,\" said the doctor to Gerard, \"but to cauterize\nthe vein when opened and the poisonous blood let free? 'Tis the only\nsafe way. Avicenna indeed recommends a ligature of the vein; but how\n'tis to be done he saith not, nor knew he himself I wot, nor any of the\nspawn of Ishmael. For me, I have no faith in such tricksy expedients;\nand take this with you for a safe principle: 'Whatever an Arab or\nArabist says is right, must be wrong.'\"\n\n\"Oh, I see now what 'tis for,\" said Denys; \"and art thou so simple as\nto let him put hot iron to thy living flesh? didst ever keep thy little\nfinger but ten moments in a candle? and this will be as many minutes.\nArt not content to burn in purgatory after thy death? must thou needs\nbuy a foretaste on't here?\"\n\n\"I never thought of that,\" said Gerard gravely; \"the good doctor spake\nnot of burning, but of cautery; to be sure 'tis all one, but cautery\nsounds not so fearful as burning.\"\n\n\"Imbecile! That is their art; to confound a plain man with dark words,\ntill his hissing flesh lets him know their meaning. Now listen to what\nI have seen. When a soldier bleeds from a wound in battle, these leeches\nsay, 'Fever. Blood him!' and so they burn the wick at t'other end too.\nThey bleed the bled. Now at fever's heels comes desperate weakness; then\nthe man needs all his blood to live; but these prickers and burners,\nhaving no forethought, recking nought of what is sure to come in a few\nhours, and seeing like brute beasts only what is under their noses,\nhaving meantime robbed him of the very blood his hurt had spared him to\nbattle that weakness withal; and so he dies exhausted. Hundreds have I\nseen so scratched and pricked out of the world, Gerard, and tall fellows\ntoo; but lo! if they have the luck to be wounded where no doctor can\nbe had, then they live; this too have I seen. Had I ever outlived that\nfield in Brabant but for my most lucky mischance, lack of chirurgery?\nThe frost chocked all my bleeding wounds, and so I lived. A chirurgeon\nhad pricked yet one more hole in this my body with his lance, and\ndrained my last drop out, and my spirit with it. Seeing them thus\ndistraught in bleeding of the bleeding soldier, I place no trust in\nthem; for what slays a veteran may well lay a milk-and-water bourgeois\nlow.\"\n\n\"This sounds like common sense,\" sighed Gerard languidly, \"but no\nneed to raise your voice so; I was not born deaf, and just now I hear\nacutely.\"\n\n\"Common sense! very common sense indeed,\" shouted the bad listener;\n\"why, this is a soldier; a brute whose business is to kill men, not cure\nthem.\" He added in very tolerable French, \"Woe be to you, unlearned\nman, if you come between a physician and his patient; and woe be to you,\nmisguided youth, if you listen to that man of blood.\"\n\n\"Much obliged,\" said Denys, with mock politeness; \"but I am a true man,\nand would rob no man of his name. I do somewhat in the way of blood, but\nnot worth mention in this presence. For one I slay, you slay a score;\nand for one spoonful of blood I draw, you spill a tubful. The world is\nstill gulled by shows. We soldiers vapour with long swords, and even in\nwar be-get two foes for every one we kill; but you smooth gownsmen, with\nsoft phrases and bare bodkins, 'tis you that thin mankind.\"\n\n\"A sick chamber is no place for jesting,\" cried the physician.\n\n\"No, doctor, nor for bawling,\" said the patient peevishly.\n\n\"Come, young man,\" said the senior kindly, \"be reasonable. Cuilibet\nin sua arte credendum est. My whole life has been given to this art. I\nstudied at Montpelier; the first school in France, and by consequence in\nEurope. There learned I Dririmancy, Scatomancy, Pathology, Therapeusis,\nand, greater than them all, Anatomy. For there we disciples of\nHippocrates and Galen had opportunities those great ancients never knew.\nGoodbye, quadrupeds and apes, and paganism, and Mohammedanism; we bought\nof the churchwardens, we shook the gallows; we undid the sexton's work\nof dark nights, penetrated with love of science and our kind; all the\nauthorities had their orders from Paris to wink; and they winked. Gods\nof Olympus, how they winked! The gracious king assisted us: he sent us\ntwice a year a living criminal condemned to die, and said, 'Deal ye with\nhim as science asks; dissect him alive, if ye think fit.'\"\n\n\"By the liver of Herod, and Nero's bowels, he'll make me blush for the\nland that bore me, an' if he praises it any more,\" shouted Denys at the\ntop of his voice.\n\nGerard gave a little squawk, and put his fingers in his ears; but\nspeedily drew them out and shouted angrily, and as loudly, \"you great\nroaring, blaspheming bull of Basan, hold your noisy tongue!\"\n\nDenys summoned a contrite look.\n\n\"Tush, slight man,\" said the doctor, with calm contempt, and vibrated\na hand over him as in this age men make a pointer dog down charge; then\nflowed majestic on. \"We seldom or never dissected the living criminal,\nexcept in part. We mostly inoculated them with such diseases as the\nbarren time afforded, selecting of course the more interesting ones.\"\n\n\"That means the foulest,\" whispered Denys meekly.\n\n\"These we watched through all their stages to maturity.\"\n\n\"Meaning the death of the poor rogue,\" whispered Denys meekly.\n\n\"And now, my poor sufferer, who best merits your confidence, this\nhonest soldier with his youth, his ignorance, and his prejudices, or a\ngreybeard laden with the gathered wisdom of ages?\"\n\n\"That is,\" cried Denys impatiently, \"will you believe what a jackdaw in\na long gown has heard from a starling in a long gown, who heard it from\na jay-pie, who heard it from a magpie, who heard it from a popinjay; or\nwill you believe what I, a man with nought to gain by looking awry, nor\nspeaking false, have seen; nor heard with the ears which are given us\nto gull us, but seen with these sentinels mine eye, seen, seen; to wit,\nthat fevered and blooded men die, that fevered men not blooded live?\nstay, who sent for this sang-sue? Did you?\"\n\n\"Not I. I thought you had.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" explained the doctor, \"the good landlord told me one was 'down'\nin his house; so I said to myself, 'A stranger, and in need of my art,'\nand came incontinently.\"\n\n\"It was the act of a good Christian, sir.\"\n\n\"Of a good bloodhound,\" cried Denys contemptuously. \"What, art thou so\ngreen as not to know that all these landlords are in league with certain\nof their fellow-citizens, who pay them toll on each booty? Whatever\nyou pay this ancient for stealing your life blood, of that the landlord\ntakes his third for betraying you to him. Nay, more, as soon as ever\nyour blood goes down the stair in that basin there, the landlord will\nsee it or smell it, and send swiftly to his undertaker and get his third\nout of that job. For if he waited till the doctor got downstairs, the\ndoctor would be beforehand and bespeak his undertaker, and then he would\nget the black thirds. Say I sooth, old Rouge et Noir? dites!\"\n\n\"Denys, Denys, who taught you to think so ill of man?\"\n\n\"Mine eyes, that are not to be gulled by what men say, seeing this many\na year what they do, in all the lands I travel.\"\n\nThe doctor with some address made use of these last words to escape\nthe personal question. \"I too have eyes as well as thou, and go not by\ntradition only, but by what I have seen, and not only seen, but done.\nI have healed as many men by bleeding as that interloping Arabist has\nkilled for want of it. 'Twas but t'other day I healed one threatened\nwith leprosy; I but bled him at the tip of the nose. I cured last year\na quartan ague: how? bled its forefinger. Our cure lost his memory. I\nbrought it him back on the point of my lance; I bled him behind the\near. I bled a dolt of a boy, and now he is the only one who can tell his\nright hand from his left in a whole family of idiots. When the plague\nwas here years ago, no sham plague, such as empyrics proclaim every six\nyears or so, but the good honest Byzantine pest, I blooded an alderman\nfreely, and cauterized the symptomatic buboes, and so pulled him out\nof the grave; whereas our then chirurgeon, a most pernicious Arabist,\ncaught it himself, and died of it, aha, calling on Rhazes, Avicenna,\nand Mahound, who, could they have come, had all perished as miserably as\nhimself.\"\n\n\"Oh, my poor ears,\" sighed Gerard.\n\n\"And am I fallen so low that one of your presence and speech rejects my\nart and listens to a rude soldier, so far behind even his own miserable\ntrade as to bear an arbalest, a worn-out invention, that German\nchildren shoot at pigeons with, but German soldiers mock at since ever\narquebusses came and put them down?\"\n\n\"You foul-mouthed old charlatan,\" cried Denys, \"the arbalest is\nshouldered by taller men than ever stood in Rhenish hose, and even now\nit kills as many more than your noisy, stinking arquebus, as the lancet\ndoes than all our toys together. Go to! He was no fool who first called\nyou 'leeches.' Sang-sues! va!\"\n\nGerard groaned. \"By the holy virgin, I wish you were both at Jericho,\nbellowing.'\n\n\"Thank you comrade. Then I'll bark no more, but at need I'll bite. If\nhe has a lance, I have a sword; if he bleeds you, I'll bleed him. The\nmoment his lance pricks your skin, little one, my sword-hilt knocks\nagainst his ribs; I have said it.\"\n\nAnd Denys turned pale, folded his arms, and looked gloomy and dangerous.\n\nGerard sighed wearily. \"Now, as all this is about me, give me leave to\nsay a word.\"\n\n\"Ay! let the young man choose life or death for himself.\"\n\nGerard then indirectly rebuked his noisy counsellors by contrast and\nexample. He spoke with unparalleled calmness, sweetness, and gentleness.\nAnd these were the words of Gerard the son of Eli. \"I doubt not you both\nmean me well; but you assassinate me between you. Calmness and quiet are\neverything to me; but you are like two dogs growling over a bone. And\nin sooth, bone I should be, did this uproar last long.\"\n\nThere was a dead silence, broken only by the silvery voice of Gerard,\nas he lay tranquil, and gazed calmly at the ceiling, and trickled into\nwords.\n\n\"First, venerable sir, I thank you for coming to see me, whether from\nhumanity, or in the way of honest gain; all trades must live.\n\n\"Your learning, reverend sir, seems great, to me at least, and for your\nexperience, your age voucheth it.\n\n\"You say you have bled many, and of these many, many have not died\nthereafter, but lived, and done well. I must needs believe you.\"\n\nThe physician bowed; Denys grunted.\n\n\"Others, you say, you have bled, and-they are dead. I must needs believe\nyou.\n\n\"Denys knows few things compared with you, but he knows them well. He is\na man not given to conjecture. This I myself have noted. He says he has\nseen the fevered and blooded for the most part die; the fevered and not\nblooded live. I must needs believe him.\n\n\"Here, then, all is doubt.\n\n\"But thus much is certain; if I be bled, I must pay you a fee, and be\nburnt and excruciated with a hot iron, who am no felon.\n\n\"Pay a certain price in money and anguish for a doubtful remedy, that\nwill I never.\n\n\"Next to money and ease, peace and quiet are certain goods, above all in\na sick-room; but 'twould seem men cannot argue medicine without heat and\nraised voices; therefore, sir, I will essay a little sleep, and Denys\nwill go forth and gaze on the females of the place, and I will keep\nyou no longer from those who can afford to lay out blood and money in\nflebotomy and cautery.\"\n\nThe old physician had naturally a hot temper; he had often during this\nbattle of words mastered it with difficulty, and now it mastered him.\nThe most dignified course was silence; he saw this, and drew himself up,\nand made loftily for the door, followed close by his little boy and big\nbasket.\n\nBut at the door he choked, he swelled, he burst. He whirled and came\nback open-mouthed, and the little boy and big basket had to\nwhisk semicircularly not to be run down, for de minimis non curat\nMedicina-even when not in a rage.\n\n\"Ah! you reject my skill, you scorn my art. My revenge shall be to leave\nyou to yourself; lost idiot, take your last look at me, and at the sun.\nYour blood be on your head!\" And away he stamped.\n\nBut on reaching the door he whirled and came back; his wicker tail\ntwirling round after him like a cat's.\n\n\"In twelve hours at furthest you will be in the secondary stage of\nfever. Your head will split. Your carotids will thump. Aha! And let but\na pin fall, you will jump to the ceiling. Then send for me; and I'll not\ncome.\" He departed. But at the door-handle gathered fury, wheeled and\ncame flying, with pale, terror-stricken boy and wicker tail whisking\nafter him. \"Next will come--CRAMPS of the STOMACH. Aha!\n\n\"Then--BILIOUS VOMIT. Aha!\n\n\"Then--COLD SWEAT, and DEADLY STUPOR.\n\n\"Then--CONFUSION OF ALL THE SENSES.\n\n\"Then--BLOODY VOMIT.\n\n\"And after that nothing can save you, not even I; and if I could I would\nnot, and so farewell!\"\n\nEven Denys changed colour at threats so fervent and precise; but Gerard\nonly gnashed his teeth with rage at the noise, and seized his hard\nbolster with kindling eye.\n\nThis added fuel to the fire, and brought the insulted ancient back from\nthe impassable door, with his whisking train.\n\n\"And after that--MADNESS!\n\n\"And after that--BLACK VOMIT\n\n\"And then--CONVULSIONS!\n\n\"And then--THAT CESSATION OF ALL VITAL FUNCTIONS THE VULGAR CALL\n'DEATH,' for which thank your own Satanic folly and insolence.\nFarewell.\" He went. He came. He roared, \"And think not to be buried in\nany Christian church-yard; for the bailiff is my good friend, and I\nshall tell him how and why you died: felo de se! felo de se! Farewell.\"\n\nGerard sprang to his feet on the bed by some supernatural gymnastic\npower excitement lent him, and seeing him so moved, the vindictive\norator came back at him fiercer than ever, to launch some master-threat\nthe world has unhappily lost; for as he came with his whisking train,\nand shaking his fist, Gerard hurled the bolster furiously in his face\nand knocked him down like a shot, the boy's head cracked under his\nfalling master's, and crash went the dumb-stricken orator into the\nbasket, and there sat wedged in an inverted angle, crushing phial\nafter phial. The boy, being light, was strewed afar, but in a squatting\nposture; so that they sat in a sequence, like graduated specimens, the\nsmaller howling. But soon the doctor's face filled with horror, and he\nuttered a far louder and unearthly screech, and kicked and struggled\nwith wonderful agility for one of his age.\n\nHe was sitting on the hot coals.\n\nThey had singed the cloth and were now biting the man. Struggling wildly\nbut vainly to get out of the basket, he rolled yelling over with it\nsideways, and lo! a great hissing; then the humane Gerard ran and\nwrenched off the tight basket not without a struggle. The doctor lay on\nhis face groaning, handsomely singed with his own chafer, and slaked a\nmoment too late by his own villainous compounds, which, however, being\nas various and even beautiful in colour as they were odious in taste,\nhad strangely diversified his grey robe, and painted it more gaudy than\nneat.\n\nGerard and Denys raised him up and consoled him. \"Courage, man, 'tis\nbut cautery; balm of Gilead, why, you recommend it but now to my comrade\nhere.\"\n\nThe physician replied only by a look of concentrated spite, and went out\nin dead silence, thrusting his stomach forth before him in the drollest\nway. The boy followed him next moment but in that slight interval he\nleft off whining, burst into a grin, and conveyed to the culprits by an\nunrefined gesture his accurate comprehension of, and rapturous though\ncompressed joy at, his master's disaster.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nTHE worthy physician went home and told his housekeeper he was in agony\nfrom \"a bad burn.\" Those were the words. For in phlogistic as in other\nthings, we cauterize our neighbour's digits, but burn our own fingers.\nHis housekeeper applied some old women's remedy mild as milk. He\nsubmitted like a lamb to her experience: his sole object in the case\nof this patient being cure: meantime he made out his bill for broken\nphials, and took measures to have the travellers imprisoned at once. He\nmade oath before a magistrate that they, being strangers and indebted to\nhim, meditated instant flight from the township.\n\nAlas! it was his unlucky day. His sincere desire and honest endeavour to\nperjure himself were baffled by a circumstance he had never foreseen nor\nindeed thought possible.\n\nHe had spoken the truth.\n\nAnd IN AN AFFIDAVIT!\n\nThe officers, on reaching \"The Silver Lion\", found the birds were flown.\n\nThey went down to the river, and from intelligence they received there,\nstarted up the bank in hot pursuit.\n\nThis temporary escape the friends owed to Denys's good sense and\nobservation. After a peal of laughter, that it was a cordial to hear,\nand after venting his watchword three times, he turned short grave, and\ntold Gerard Dusseldorf was no place for them. \"That old fellow,\" said\nhe, \"went off unnaturally silent for such a babbler: we are strangers\nhere; the bailiff is his friend: in five minutes we shall lie in a\ndungeon for assaulting a Dusseldorf dignity, are you strong enough to\nhobble to the water's edge? it is hard by. Once there you have but to\nlie down in a boat instead of a bed; and what is the odds?\"\n\n\"The odds, Denys? untold, and all in favour of the boat. I pine for\nRome; for Rome is my road to Sevenbergen; and then we shall lie in the\nboat, but ON the Rhine, the famous Rhine; the cool, refreshing Rhine.\nI feel its breezes coming: the very sight will cure a little\nhop-'o-my-thumb fever like mine; away! away!\"\n\nFinding his excitable friend in this mood, Denys settled hastily with\nthe landlord, and they hurried to the river. On inquiry they found to\ntheir dismay that the public boat was gone this half hour, and no other\nwould start that day, being afternoon. By dint, however, of asking a\ngreat many questions, and collecting a crowd, they obtained an offer of\na private boat from an old man and his two sons.\n\nThis was duly ridiculed by a bystander. \"The current is too strong for\nthree oars.\"\n\n\"Then my comrade and I will help row,\" said the invalid.\n\n\"No need,\" said the old man. \"Bless your silly heart, he owns t'other\nboat.\"\n\nThere was a powerful breeze right astern; the boatmen set a broad sail,\nand rowing also, went off at a spanking rate.\n\n\"Are ye better, lad, for the river breeze?\"\n\n\"Much better. But indeed the doctor did me good.\"\n\n\"The doctor? Why, you would none of his cures.\"\n\n\"No, but I mean--you will say I am nought--but knocking the old fool\ndown--somehow--it soothed me.\"\n\n\"Amiable dove! how thy little character opens more and more every day,\nlike a rosebud. I read thee all wrong at first.\"\n\n\"Nay, Denys, mistake me not, neither. I trust I had borne with his idle\nthreats, though in sooth his voice went through my poor ears; but he was\nan infidel, or next door to one, and such I have been taught to abhor.\nDid he not as good as say, we owed our inward parts to men with long\nGreek names, and not to Him, whose name is but a syllable, but whose\nhand is over all the earth? Pagan!\"\n\n\"So you knocked him down forthwith--like a good Christian.\"\n\n\"Now, Denys, you will still be jesting. Take not an ill man's part. Had\nit been a thunderbolt from Heaven, he had met but his due; yet he took\nbut a sorry bolster from this weak arm.\"\n\n\"What weak arm?\" inquired Denys, with twinkling eyes. \"I have lived\namong arms, and by Samson's hairy pow never saw I one more like a\ncatapult. The bolster wrapped round his nose and the two ends kissed\nbehind his head, and his forehead resounded, and had he been Goliath,\nor Julius Caesar, instead of an old quacksalver, down he had gone. St.\nDenys guard me from such feeble opposites as thou! and above all from\ntheir weak arms--thou diabolical young hypocrite.\"\n\n\nThe river took many turns, and this sometimes brought the wind on their\nside instead of right astern. Then they all moved to the weather side\nto prevent the boat heeling over too much all but a child of about five\nyears old, the grandson of the boatman, and his darling; this urchin\nhad slipped on board at the moment of starting, and being too light\nto affect the boat's trim, was above, or rather below, the laws of\nnavigation.\n\nThey sailed merrily on, little conscious that they were pursued by a\nwhole posse of constables armed with the bailiff's writ, and that their\npursuers were coming up with them; for if the wind was strong, so was\nthe current.\n\nAnd now Gerard suddenly remembered that this was a very good way to\nRome, but not to Burgundy. \"Oh, Denys,\" said he, with an almost alarmed\nlook, \"this is not your road.\"\n\n\"I know it,\" said Denys quietly; \"but what can I do? I cannot leave thee\ntill the fever leaves thee; and it is on thee still, for thou art\nboth red and white by turns; I have watched thee. I must e'en go on to\nCologne, I doubt, and then strike across.\"\n\n\"Thank Heaven,\" said Gerard joyfully. He added eagerly, with a little\ntouch of self-deception, \"'Twere a sin to be so near Cologne and not see\nit. Oh, man, it is a vast and ancient city such as I have often dreamed\nof, but ne'er had the good luck to see. Me miserable, by what hard\nfortune do I come to it now? Well then, Denys,\" continued the young man\nless warmly, \"it is old enough to have been founded by a Roman lady\nin the first century of grace, and sacked by Attila the barbarous, and\nafterwards sore defaced by the Norman Lothaire. And it has a church\nfor every week in the year forbye chapels and churches innumerable\nof convents and nunneries, and above all, the stupendous minster yet\nunfinished, and therein, but in their own chapel, lie the three kings\nthat brought gifts to our Lord, Melchior gold, and Gaspar frankincense,\nand Balthazar the black king, he brought myrrh; and over their bones\nstands the shrine the wonder of the world; it is of ever-shining brass\nbrighter than gold, studded with images fairly wrought, and inlaid with\nexquisite devices, and brave with colours; and two broad stripes run to\nand fro, of jewels so great, so rare, each might adorn a crown or\nransom its wearer at need; and upon it stand the three kings curiously\ncounterfeited, two in solid silver, richly gilt; these be bareheaded;\nbut he of Aethiop ebony, and beareth a golden crown; and in the midst\nour blessed Lady, in virgin silver, with Christ in her arms; and at the\ncorners, in golden branches, four goodly waxen tapers do burn night and\nday. Holy eyes have watched and renewed that light unceasingly for\nages, and holy eyes shall watch them in saecula. I tell thee, Denys, the\noldest song, the oldest Flemish or German legend, found them burning,\nand they shall light the earth to its grave. And there is St. Ursel's\nchurch, a British saint's, where lie her bones and all the other virgins\nher fellows; eleven thousand were they who died for the faith, being put\nto the sword by barbarous Moors, on the twenty-third day of October, two\nhundred and thirty-eight. Their bones are piled in the vaults, and many\nof their skulls are in the church. St. Ursel's is in a thin golden case,\nand stands on the high altar, but shown to humble Christians only on\nsolemn days.\"\n\n\"Eleven thousand virgins!\" cried Denys. \"What babies German men must\nhave been in days of yore. Well, would all their bones might turn flesh\nagain, and their skulls sweet faces, as we pass through the gates. 'Tis\nodds but some of them are wearied of their estate by this time.\"\n\n\"Tush, Denys!\" said Gerard; \"why wilt thou, being good, still make\nthyself seem evil? If thy wishing-cap be on, pray that we may meet the\nmeanest she of all those wise virgins in the next world, and to that\nend let us reverence their holy dust in this one. And then there is the\nchurch of the Maccabees, and the cauldron in which they and their\nmother Solomona were boiled by a wicked king for refusing to eat swine's\nflesh.\"\n\n\"Oh, peremptory king! and pig-headed Maccabees! I had eaten bacon with\nmy pork liever than change places at the fire with my meat.\"\n\n\"What scurvy words are these? it was their faith.\"\n\n\"Nay, bridle thy choler, and tell me, are there nought but churches\nin this thy so vaunted city? for I affect rather Sir Knight than Sir\nPriest.\"\n\n\"Ay, marry, there is an university near a hundred years old; and there\nis a market-place, no fairer in the world, and at the four sides of\nit houses great as palaces; and there is a stupendous senate-house all\ncovered with images, and at the head of them stands one of stout Herman\nGryn, a soldier like thyself, lad.\"\n\n\"Ay. Tell me of him! what feat of arms earned him his niche?\"\n\n\"A rare one. He slew a lion in fair combat, with nought but his cloak\nand a short sword. He thrust the cloak in the brute's mouth, and cut\nhis spine in twain, and there is the man's effigy and eke the lion's to\nprove it. The like was never done but by three more, I ween; Samson\nwas one, and Lysimachus of Macedon another, and Benaiah, a captain of\nDavid's host.\"\n\n\"Marry! three tall fellows. I would like well to sup with them all\nto-night.\"\n\n\"So would not I,\" said Gerard drily.\n\n\"But tell me,\" said Denys, with some surprise, \"when wast thou in\nCologne?\"\n\n\"Never but in the spirit. I prattle with the good monks by the way, and\nthey tell me all the notable things both old and new.\n\n\"Ay, ay, have not I seen your nose under their very cowls? But when I\nspeak of matters that are out of sight, my words they are small, and the\nthing it was big; now thy words be as big or bigger than the things; art\na good limner with thy tongue; I have said it; and for a saint, as ready\nwith hand, or steel, or bolster--as any poor sinner living; and so,\nshall I tell thee which of all these things thou hast described draws me\nto Cologne?\"\n\n\"Ay, Denys.\"\n\n\"Thou, and thou only; no dead saint, but my living friend and comrade\ntrue; 'tis thou alone draws Denys of Burgundy to Cologne?\"\n\nGerard hung his head.\n\nAt this juncture one of the younger boatmen suddenly inquired what was\namiss with \"little turnip-face?\"\n\nHis young nephew thus described had just come aft grave as a judge, and\nburst out crying in the midst without more ado. On this phenomenon,\nso sharply defined, he was subjected to many interrogatories, some\ncoaxingly uttered, some not. Had he hurt himself? had he over-ate\nhimself? was he frightened? was he cold? was he sick? was he an idiot?\n\nTo all and each he uttered the same reply, which English writers render\nthus, oh! oh! oh! and French writers thus, hi! hi! hi! So fixed are\nFiction's phonetics.\n\n\"Who can tell what ails the peevish brat?\" snarled the young boatman\nimpatiently. \"Rather look this way and tell me whom be these after!\"\nThe old man and his other son looked, and saw four men walking along\nthe east bank of the river; at the sight they left rowing awhile, and\ngathered mysteriously in the stern, whispering and casting glances\nalternately at their passengers and the pedestrians.\n\nThe sequel may show they would have employed speculation better in\ntrying to fathom the turnip-face mystery; I beg pardon of my age: I mean\nthe deep mind of dauntless infancy.\n\n\"If 'tis as I doubt,\" whispered one of the young men, \"why not give them\na squeak for their lives; let us make for the west bank.\"\n\nThe old man objected stoutly. \"What,\" said he, \"run our heads into\ntrouble for strangers! are ye mad? Nay, let us rather cross to the east\nside; still side with the strong arm! that is my rede. What say you,\nWerter?\"\n\n\"I say, please yourselves.\"\n\nWhat age and youth could not decide upon, a puff of wind settled most\nimpartially. Came a squall, and the little vessel heeled over; the men\njumped to windward to trim her; but to their horror they saw in the very\nboat from stem to stern a ditch of water rushing to leeward, and the\nnext moment they saw nothing, but felt the Rhine, the cold and rushing\nRhine.\n\n\"Turnip-face\" had drawn the plug.\n\nThe officers unwound the cords from their waists.\n\nGerard could swim like a duck; but the best swimmer, canted out of a\nboat capsized, must sink ere he can swim. The dark water bubbled loudly\nover his head, and then he came up almost blind and deaf for a moment;\nthe next, he saw the black boat bottom uppermost, and figures clinging\nto it; he shook his head like a water-dog, and made for it by a sort of\nunthinking imitation; but ere he reached it he heard a voice behind him\ncry not loud but with deep manly distress, \"Adieu, comrade, adieu!\"\n\nHe looked, and there was poor Denys sinking, sinking, weighed down by\nhis wretched arbalest. His face was pale, and his eyes staring wide,\nand turned despairingly on his dear friend. Gerard uttered a wild cry\nof love and terror, and made for him, cleaving the water madly; but the\nnext moment Denys was under water.\n\nThe next, Gerard was after him.\n\nThe officers knotted a rope and threw the end in.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nThings good and evil balance themselves in a remarkable manner and\nalmost universally. The steel bow attached to the arbalestrier's back,\nand carried above his head, had sunk him. That very steel bow, owing\nto that very position, could not escape Gerard's hands, one of which\ngrasped it, and the other went between the bow and the cord, which was\nas good. The next moment, Denys, by means of his crossbow, was hoisted\nwith so eager a jerk that half his body bobbed up out of water.\n\n\"Now, grip me not! grip me not!\" cried Gerard, in mortal terror of that\nfatal mistake.\n\n\"Pas si bete,\" gurgled Denys.\n\nSeeing the sort of stuff he had to deal with, Gerard was hopeful and\ncalm directly. \"On thy back,\" said he sharply, and seizing the arbalest,\nand taking a stroke forward, he aided the desired movement. \"Hand on\nmy shoulder! slap the water with the other hand! No--with a downward\nmotion; so. Do nothing more than I bid thee.\" Gerard had got hold of\nDenys's long hair, and twisting it hard, caught the end between his side\nteeth, and with the strong muscles of his youthful neck easily kept up\nthe soldier's head, and struck out lustily across the current. A moment\nhe had hesitated which side to make for, little knowing the awful\nimportance of that simple decision; then seeing the west bank a trifle\nnearest, he made towards it, instead of swimming to jail like a good\nboy, and so furnishing one a novel incident. Owing to the force of the\ncurrent they slanted considerably, and when they had covered near a\nhundred yards, Denys murmured uneasily, \"How much more of it?\"\n\n\"Courage,\" mumbled Gerard. \"Whatever a duck knows, a Dutchman knows; art\nsafe as in bed.\"\n\nThe next moment, to their surprise, they found themselves in shallow\nwater, and so waded ashore. Once on terra firma, they looked at one\nanother from head to foot as if eyes could devour, then by one impulse\nflung each an arm round the other's neck, and panted there with hearts\ntoo full to speak. And at this sacred moment life was sweet as heaven to\nboth; sweetest perhaps to the poor exiled lover, who had just saved his\nfriend. Oh, joy to whose height what poet has yet soared, or ever tried\nto soar? To save a human life; and that life a loved one. Such moments\nare worth living for, ay, three score years and ten. And then, calmer,\nthey took hands, and so walked along the bank hand in hand like a pair\nof sweethearts, scarce knowing or caring whither they went.\n\nThe boat people were all safe on the late concave, now convex craft,\nHerr Turnip-face, the \"Inverter of things,\" being in the middle. All\nthis fracas seemed not to have essentially deranged his habits. At least\nhe was greeting when he shot our friends into the Rhine, and greeting\nwhen they got out again.\n\n\"Shall we wait till they right the boat?\"\n\n\"No, Denys, our fare is paid; we owe them nought. Let us on, and\nbriskly.\"\n\nDenys assented, observing that they could walk all the way to Cologne on\nthis bank.\n\n\"I fare not to Cologne,\" was the calm reply.\n\n\"Why, whither then?\"\n\n\"To Burgundy.\"\n\n\"To Burgundy? Ah, no! that is too good to be sooth.\"\n\n\"Sooth 'tis, and sense into the bargain. What matters it to me how I go\nto Rome?\"\n\n\"Nay, nay; you but say so to pleasure me. The change is too sudden; and\nthink me not so ill-hearted as take you at your word. Also did I not see\nyour eyes sparkle at the wonders of Cologne? the churches, the images,\nthe relics\n\n\"How dull art thou, Denys; that was when we were to enjoy them together.\nChurches! I shall see plenty, go Rome-ward how I will. The bones of\nsaints and martyrs; alas! the world is full of them; but a friend like\nthee, where on earth's face shall I find another? No, I will not turn\nthee farther from the road that leads to thy dear home, and her that\npines for thee. Neither will I rob myself of thee by leaving thee. Since\nI drew thee out of Rhine I love thee better than I did. Thou art my\npearl: I fished thee; and must keep thee. So gainsay me not, or thou\nwilt bring back my fever; but cry courage, and lead on; and hey for\nBurgundy!\"\n\nDenys gave a joyful caper. \"Courage! va pour la Bourgogne. Oh! soyes\ntranquille! cette fois il est bien decidement mort, ce coquin-la.\" And\nthey turned their backs on the Rhine.\n\nOn this decision making itself clear, across the Rhine there was a\ncommotion in the little party that had been watching the discussion, and\nthe friends had not taken many steps ere a voice came to them over the\nwater. \"HALT!\"\n\nGerard turned, and saw one of those four holding out a badge of office\nand a parchment slip. His heart sank; for he was a good citizen, and\nused to obey the voice that now bade him turn again to Dusseldorf--the\nLaw's.\n\nDenys did not share his scruples. He was a Frenchman, and despised every\nother nation, laws, inmates, and customs included. He was a soldier,\nand took a military view of the situation. Superior force opposed; river\nbetween; rear open; why, 'twas retreat made easy. He saw at a glance\nthat the boat still drifted in mid-stream, and there was no ferry nearer\nthan Dusseldorf. \"I shall beat a quick retreat to that hill,\" said he,\n\"and then, being out of sight, quick step.\"\n\nThey sauntered off.\n\n\"Halt! in the bailiff's name,\" cried a voice from the shore.\n\nDenys turned round and ostentatiously snapped his fingers at the\nbailiff, and proceeded.\n\n\"Halt! in the archbishop's name.\"\n\nDenys snapped his fingers at his grace, and proceeded.\n\n\"Halt! in the emperor's name.\"\n\nDenys snapped his fingers at his majesty, and proceeded.\n\nGerard saw this needless pantomime with regret, and as soon as they had\npassed the brow of the hill, said, \"There is now but one course, we must\nrun to Burgundy instead of walking;\" and he set off, and ran the best\npart of a league without stopping.\n\nDenys was fairly blown, and inquired what on earth had become of\nGerard's fever. \"I begin to miss it sadly,\" said he drily.\n\n\"I dropped it in Rhine, I trow,\" was the reply.\n\nPresently they came to a little village, and here Denys purchased a loaf\nand a huge bottle of Rhenish wine. \"For,\" he said, \"we must sleep in\nsome hole or corner. If we lie at an inn, we shall be taken in our\nbeds.\" This was no more than common prudence on the old soldier's part.\n\nThe official network for catching law-breakers, especially plebeian\nones, was very close in that age; though the co-operation of the public\nwas almost null, at all events upon the Continent. The innkeepers were\neverywhere under close surveillance as to their travellers, for whose\nacts they were even in some degree responsible, more so it would seem\nthan for their sufferings.\n\nThe friends were both glad when the sun set; and delighted, when, after\na long trudge under the stars (for the moon, if I remember right, did\nnot rise till about three in the morning) they came to a large barn\nbelonging to a house at some distance. A quantity of barley had been\nlately thrashed; for the heap of straw on one side the thrashing-floor\nwas almost as high as the unthrashed corn on the other.\n\n\"Here be two royal beds,\" said Denys; \"which shall we lie on, the mow,\nor the straw?\"\n\n\"The straw for me,\" said Gerard.\n\nThey sat on the heap, and ate their brown bread, and drank their wine,\nand then Denys covered his friend up in straw, and heaped it high above\nhim, leaving him only a breathing hole: \"Water, they say, is death to\nfevered men; I'll make warm water on't, anyhow.\"\n\nGerard bade him make his mind easy. \"These few drops from Rhine cannot\nchill me. I feel heat enough in my body now to parch a kennel, or boil a\ncloud if I was in one.\" And with this epigram his consciousness went so\nrapidly, he might really be said to \"fall asleep.\"\n\nDenys, who lay awake awhile, heard that which made him nestle closer.\nHorses' hoofs came ringing up from Dusseldorf, and the wooden barn\nvibrated as they rattled past howling in a manner too well known and\nunderstood in the 15th century, but as unfamiliar in Europe now as a red\nIndian's war-whoop.\n\nDenys shook where he lay.\n\nGerard slept like a top.\n\nIt all swept by, and troop and howls died away.\n\nThe stout soldier drew a long breath, whistled in a whisper, closed his\neyes, and slept like a top, too.\n\nIn the morning he sat up and put out his hand to wake Gerard. It lighted\non the young man's forehead, and found it quite wet. Denys then in his\nquality of nurse forbore to wake him. \"It is ill to check sleep or sweat\nin a sick man,\" said he. \"I know that far, though I ne'er minced ape nor\ngallows-bird.\"\n\nAfter waiting a good hour he felt desperately hungry; so he turned, and\nin self-defence went to sleep again.\n\nPoor fellow, in his hard life he had been often driven to this\nmanoeuvre. At high noon he was waked by Gerard moving, and found him\nsitting up with the straw smoking round him like a dung-hill. Animal\nheat versus moisture. Gerard called him \"a lazy loon.\" He quietly\ngrinned.\n\nThey set out, and the first thing Denys did was to give Gerard his\narbalest, etc., and mount a high tree on the road. \"Coast clear to the\nnext village,\" said he, and on they went.\n\nOn drawing near the village, Denys halted and suddenly inquired of\nGerard how he felt.\n\n\"What! can you not see? I feel as if Rome was no further than yon\nhamlet.\"\n\n\"But thy body, lad; thy skin?\"\n\n\"Neither hot nor cold; and yesterday 'twas hot one while and cold\nanother. But what I cannot get rid of is this tiresome leg.\"\n\n\"Le grand malheur! Many of my comrades have found no such difficulty.\"\n\n\"Ah! there it goes again; itches consumedly.\"\n\n\"Unhappy youth,\" said Denys solemnly, \"the sum of thy troubles is this:\nthy fever is gone, and thy wound is--healing. Sith so it is,\" added he\nindulgently, \"I shall tell thee a little piece of news I had otherwise\nwithheld.\"\n\n\"What is't?\" asked Gerard, sparkling with curiosity.\n\n\"THE HUE AND CRY IS OUT AFTER US: AND ON FLEET HORSES.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nGerard was staggered by this sudden communication, and his colour came\nand went. Then he clenched his teeth with ire. For men of any spirit\nat all are like the wild boar; he will run from a superior force, owing\nperhaps to his not being an ass; but if you stick to his heels too long\nand too close, and, in short, bore him, he will whirl, and come tearing\nat a multitude of hunters, and perhaps bore you. Gerard then set his\nteeth and looked battle, But the next moment his countenance fell, and\nhe said plaintively, \"And my axe is in Rhine.\"\n\nThey consulted together. Prudence bade them avoid that village; hunger\nsaid \"buy food.\"\n\nHunger spoke loudest. Prudence most convincingly. They settled to strike\nacross the fields.\n\nThey halted at a haystack and borrowed two bundles of hay, and lay on\nthem in a dry ditch out of sight, but in nettles.\n\nThey sallied out in turn and came back with turnips. These they munched\nat intervals in their retreat until sunset.\n\nPresently they crept out shivering into the rain and darkness, and got\ninto the road on the other side of the village.\n\nIt was a dismal night, dark as pitch, and blowing hard. They could\nneither see, nor hear, nor be seen, nor heard; and for aught I know,\npassed like ghosts close to their foes. These they almost forgot in the\nnatural horrors of the black tempestuous night, in which they seemed to\ngrope and hew their way as in black marble. When the moon rose they were\nmany a league from Dusseldorf. But they still trudged on. Presently they\ncame to a huge building.\n\n\"Courage!\" cried Denys, \"I think I know this convent. Aye it is. We are\nin the see of Juliers. Cologne has no power here.\"\n\nThe next moment they were safe within the walls.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nHere Gerard made acquaintance with a monk, who had constructed the\ngreat dial in the prior's garden, and a wheel for drawing water, and\na winnowing machine for the grain, etc., and had ever some ingenious\nmechanism on hand. He had made several psalteries and two dulcimers, and\nwas now attempting a set of regalles, or little organ for the choir.\n\nNow Gerard played the humble psaltery a little; but the monk touched\nthat instrument divinely, and showed him most agreeably what a novice\nhe was in music. He also illuminated finely, but could not write so\nbeautifully as Gerard. Comparing their acquirements with the earnestness\nand simplicity of an age in which accomplishments implied a true natural\nbent, Youth and Age soon became like brothers, and Gerard was pressed\nhard to stay that night. He consulted Denys, who assented with a rueful\nshrug.\n\nGerard told his old new friend whither he was going, and described their\nlate adventures, softening down the bolster.\n\n\"Alack!\" said the good old man, \"I have been a great traveller in my\nday, but none molested me.\" He then told him to avoid inns; they were\nalways haunted by rogues and roysterers, whence his soul might take harm\neven did his body escape, and to manage each day's journey so as to lie\nat some peaceful monastery; then suddenly breaking off and looking as\nsharp as a needle at Gerard, he asked him how long since he had been\nshriven? Gerard coloured up and replied feebly--\n\n\"Better than a fortnight.\"\n\n\"And thou an exorcist! No wonder perils have overtaken thee. Come, thou\nmust be assoiled out of hand.\"\n\n\"Yes, father,\" said Gerard, \"and with all mine heart;\" and was sinking\ndown to his knees, with his hands joined, but the monk stopped him half\nfretfully--\n\n\"Not to me! not to me! not to me! I am as full of the world as thou or\nany be that lives in't. My whole soul it is in these wooden pipes, and\nsorry leathern stops, which shall perish--with them whose minds are\nfixed on such like vanities.\"\n\n\"Dear father,\" said Gerard, \"they are for the use of the Church, and\nsurely that sanctifies the pains and labour spent on them?\"\n\n\"That is just what the devil has been whispering in mine ear this\nwhile,\" said the monk, putting one hand behind his back and shaking his\nfinger half threateningly, half playfully, at Gerard. \"He was even so\nkind and thoughtful as to mind me that Solomon built the Lord a house\nwith rare hangings, and that this in him was counted gracious and no\nsin. Oh! he can quote Scripture rarely. But I am not so simple a monk\nas you think, my lad,\" cried the good father, with sudden defiance,\naddressing not Gerard but--Vacancy. \"This one toy finished, vigils,\nfasts, and prayers for me; prayers standing, prayers lying on the chapel\nfloor, and prayers in a right good tub of cold water.\" He nudged Gerard\nand winked his eye knowingly. \"Nothing he hates and dreads like seeing\nus monks at our orisons up to our chins in cold water. For corpus domat\naqua. So now go confess thy little trumpery sins, pardonable in youth\nand secularity, and leave me to mine, sweet to me as honey, and to be\nexpiated in proportion.\"\n\nGerard bowed his head, but could not help saying, \"Where shall I find a\nconfessor more holy and clement?\"\n\n\"In each of these cells,\" replied the monk simply (they were now in the\ncorridor) \"there, go to Brother Anselm, yonder.\"\n\nGerard followed the monk's direction, and made for a cell; but the doors\nwere pretty close to one another, and it seems he mistook; for just\nas he was about to tap, he heard his old friend crying to him in an\nagitated whisper, \"Nay! nay! nay!\" He turned, and there was the monk\nat his cell-door, in a strange state of anxiety, going up and down\nand beating the air double-handed, like a bottom sawyer. Gerard really\nthought the cell he was at must be inhabited by some dangerous wild\nbeast, if not by that personage whose presence in the convent had been\nso distinctly proclaimed. He looked back inquiringly and went on to the\nnext door. Then his old friend nodded his head rapidly, bursting in a\nmoment into a comparatively blissful expression of face, and shot back\ninto his den. He took his hour-glass, turned it, and went to work on his\nregalles; and often he looked up, and said to himself, \"Well-a-day, the\nsands how swift they run when the man is bent over earthly toys.\"\n\nFather Anselm was a venerable monk, with an ample head, and a face all\ndignity and love. Therefore Gerard in confessing to him, and replying to\nhis gentle though searching questions, could not help thinking, \"Here is\na head!--Oh dear! oh dear! I wonder whether you will let me draw it when\nI have done confessing.\" And so his own head got confused, and he forgot\na crime or two. However, he did not lower the bolstering this time,\nnor was he so uncandid as to detract from the pagan character of the\nbolstered.\n\nThe penance inflicted was this: he was to enter the convent church, and\nprostrating himself, kiss the lowest step of the altar three times;\nthen kneeling on the floor, to say three paternosters and a credo: \"this\ndone, come back to me on the instant.\"\n\nAccordingly, his short mortification performed, Gerard returned, and\nfound Father Anselm spreading plaster.\n\n\"After the soul the body,\" said he; \"know that I am the chirurgeon here,\nfor want of a better. This is going on thy leg; to cool it, not to burn\nit; the saints forbid.\"\n\nDuring the operation the monastic leech, who had naturally been\ninterested by the Dusseldorf branch of Gerard's confession, rather sided\nwith Denys upon \"bleeding.\" \"We Dominicans seldom let blood nowadays;\nthe lay leeches say 'tis from timidity and want of skill; but, in sooth,\nwe have long found that simples will cure most of the ills that can\nbe cured at all. Besides, they never kill in capable hands; and other\nremedies slay like thunderbolts. As for the blood, the Vulgate saith\nexpressly it is the life of a man.' And in medicine or law, as in\ndivinity, to be wiser than the All-wise is to be a fool. Moreover,\nsimples are mighty. The little four-footed creature that kills the\npoisonous snake, if bitten herself, finds an herb powerful enough to\nquell that poison, though stronger and of swifter operation than any\nmortal malady; and we, taught by her wisdom, and our own traditions,\nstill search and try the virtues of those plants the good God hath\nstrewed this earth with, some to feed men's bodies, some to heal them.\nOnly in desperate ills we mix heavenly with earthly virtue. We steep\nthe hair or the bones of some dead saint in the medicine, and thus work\nmarvellous cures.\"\n\n\"Think you, father, it is along of the reliques? for Peter a Floris, a\nlearned leech and no pagan, denies it stoutly.\"\n\n\"What knows Peter a Floris? And what know I? I take not on me to say\nwe can command the saints, and will they nill they, can draw corporal\nvirtue from their blest remains. But I see that the patient drinking\nthus in faith is often bettered as by a charm. Doubtless faith in the\nrecipient is for much in all these cures. But so 'twas ever. A sick\nwoman, that all the Jewish leeches failed to cure, did but touch\nChrist's garment and was healed in a moment. Had she not touched that\nsacred piece of cloth she had never been healed. Had she without faith\nnot touched it only, but worn it to her grave, I trow she had been none\nthe better for't. But we do ill to search these things too curiously.\nAll we see around us calls for faith. Have then a little patience.\nWe shall soon know all. Meantime, I, thy confessor for the nonce, do\nstrictly forbid thee, on thy soul's health, to hearken learned lay folk\non things religious. Arrogance is their bane; with it they shut heaven's\nopen door in their own faces. Mind, I say, learned laics. Unlearned ones\nhave often been my masters in humility, and may be thine. Thy wound is\ncared for; in three days 'twill be but a scar. And now God speed thee,\nand the saints make thee as good and as happy as thou art thoughtful\nand gracious.\" Gerard hoped there was no need to part yet, for he was\nto dine in the refectory. But Father Anselm told him, with a shade of\nregret just perceptible and no more, that he did not leave his cell this\nweek, being himself in penitence; and with this he took Gerard's head\ndelicately in both hands, and kissed him on the brow, and almost before\nthe cell door had closed on him, was back to his pious offices. Gerard\nwent away chilled to the heart by the isolation of the monastic life,\nand saddened too. \"Alas!\" he thought, \"here is a kind face I must never\nlook to see again on earth; a kind voice gone from mine ear and my heart\nfor ever. There is nothing but meeting and parting in this sorrowful\nworld. Well-a-day! well-a-day!\" This pensive mood was interrupted by\na young monk who came for him and took him to the refectory; there he\nfound several monks seated at a table, and Denys standing like a poker,\nbeing examined as to the towns he should pass through: the friars\nthen clubbed their knowledge, and marked out the route, noting all the\nreligious houses on or near that road; and this they gave Gerard. Then\nsupper, and after it the old monk carried Gerard to his cell, and they\nhad an eager chat, and the friar incidentally revealed the cause of\nhis pantomime in the corridor. \"Ye had well-nigh fallen into Brother\nJerome's clutches. Yon was his cell.\"\n\n\"Is Father Jerome an ill man, then?\"\n\n\"An ill man!\" and the friar crossed himself; \"a saint, an anchorite, the\nvery pillar of this house! He had sent ye barefoot to Loretto. Nay, I\nforgot, y'are bound for Italy; the spiteful old saint upon earth, had\nsent ye to Canterbury or Compostella. But Jerome was born old and with\na cowl; Anselm and I were boys once, and wicked beyond anything you\ncan imagine\" (Gerard wore a somewhat incredulous look): \"this keeps us\nhumble more or less, and makes us reasonably lenient to youth and hot\nblood.\"\n\nThen, at Gerard's earnest request, one more heavenly strain upon the\npsalterion, and so to bed, the troubled spirit calmed, and the sore\nheart soothed.\n\n\nI have described in full this day, marked only by contrast, a day that\ncame like oil on waves after so many passions and perils--because it\nmust stand in this narrative as the representative of many such days\nwhich now succeeded to it. For our travellers on their weary way\nexperienced that which most of my readers will find in the longer\njourney of life, viz., that stirring events are not evenly distributed\nover the whole road, but come by fits and starts, and as it were, in\nclusters. To some extent this may be because they draw one another by\nlinks more or less subtle. But there is more in it than that. It happens\nso. Life is an intermittent fever. Now all narrators, whether of history\nor fiction, are compelled to slur these barren portions of time or else\nline trunks. The practice, however, tends to give the unguarded reader\na wrong arithmetical impression, which there is a particular reason\nfor avoiding in these pages as far as possible. I invite therefore your\nintelligence to my aid, and ask you to try and realize that, although\nthere were no more vivid adventures for a long while, one day's march\nsucceeded another; one monastery after another fed and lodged them\ngratis with a welcome always charitable, sometimes genial; and though\nthey met no enemy but winter and rough weather, antagonists not always\ncontemptible, yet they trudged over a much larger tract of territory\nthan that, their passage through which I have described so minutely. And\nso the pair, Gerard bronzed in the face and travel-stained from head to\nfoot, and Denys with his shoes in tatters, stiff and footsore both of\nthem, drew near the Burgundian frontier.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nGerard was almost as eager for this promised land as Denys; for the\nlatter constantly chanted its praises, and at every little annoyance\nshowed him \"they did things better in Burgundy;\" and above all played on\nhis foible by guaranteeing clean bedclothes at the inns of that polished\nnation. \"I ask no more,\" the Hollander would say; \"to think that I have\nnot lain once in a naked bed since I left home! When I look at their\nlinen, instead of doffing habit and hose, it is mine eyes and nose I\nwould fain be shut of.\"\n\nDenys carried his love of country so far as to walk twenty leagues in\nshoes that had exploded, rather than buy of a German churl, who would\nthrow all manner of obstacles in a customer's way, his incivility, his\ndinner, his body.\n\nTowards sunset they found themselves at equal distances from a little\ntown and a monastery, only the latter was off the road. Denys was for\nthe inn, Gerard for the convent. Denys gave way, but on condition that\nonce in Burgundy they should always stop at an inn. Gerard consented\nto this the more readily that his chart with its list of convents ended\nhere. So they turned off the road. And now Gerard asked with surprise\nwhence this sudden aversion to places that had fed and lodged them\ngratis so often. The soldier hemmed and hawed at first, but at last his\nwrongs burst forth. It came out that this was no sudden aversion, but an\nancient and abiding horror, which he had suppressed till now, but with\ninfinite difficulty, and out of politeness: \"I saw they had put powder\nin your drink,\" said he, \"so I forbore them. However, being the last,\nwhy not ease my mind? Know then I have been like a fish out of water\nin all those great dungeons. You straightway levant with some old\nshaveling: so you see not my purgatory.\"\n\n\"Forgive me! I have been selfish.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, I forgive thee, little one; 'tis not thy fault: art not the\nfirst fool that has been priest-rid, and monk-hit. But I'll not\nforgive them my misery.\" Then, about a century before Henry VIII.'s\ncommissioners, he delivered his indictment. These gloomy piles were\nall built alike. Inns differed, but here all was monotony. Great gate,\nlittle gate, so many steps and then a gloomy cloister. Here the dortour,\nthere the great cold refectory, where you must sit mumchance, or at\nleast inaudible, he who liked to speak his mind out; \"and then,\"\nsaid he, \"nobody is a man here, but all are slaves, and of what? of a\npeevish, tinkling bell, that never sleeps. An 'twere a trumpet now, aye\nsounding alarums, 'twouldn't freeze a man's heart so. Tinkle, tinkle,\ntinkle, and you must sit to meat with may be no stomach for food. Ere\nyour meat settles in your stomach, tinkle, tinkle! and ye must to church\nwith may be no stomach for devotion: I am not a hog at prayers, for one.\nTinkle, tinkle, and now you must to bed with your eyes open. Well, by\nthen you have contrived to shut them, some uneasy imp of darkness has\ngot to the bell-rope, and tinkle, tinkle, it behoves you say a prayer in\nthe dark, whether you know one or not. If they heard the sort of prayers\nI mutter when they break my rest with their tinkle! Well, you drop off\nagain and get about an eyeful of sleep: lo, it is tinkle, tinkle, for\nmatins.\"\n\n\"And the only clapper you love is a woman's,\" put in Gerard half\ncontemptuously.\n\n\"Because there is some music in that even when it scolds,\" was the stout\nreply. \"And then to be always checked. If I do but put my finger in the\nsalt-cellar, straightway I hear, 'Have you no knife that you finger the\nsalt?' And if I but wipe my knife on the cloth to save time, then 'tis,\n'Wipe thy knife dirty on the bread, and clean upon the cloth!' Oh small\nof soul! these little peevish pedantries fall chill upon good fellowship\nlike wee icicles a-melting down from strawen eaves.\"\n\n\"I hold cleanliness no pedantry,\" said Gerard. \"Shouldst learn better\nmanners once for all.\"\n\n\"Nay; 'tis they who lack manners. They stop a fellow's mouth at every\nword.\"\n\n\"At every other word, you mean; every obscene or blasphemous one.\"\n\n\"Exaggerator, go to! Why, at the very last of these dungeons I found the\npoor travellers sitting all chilled and mute round one shaveling, like\nrogues awaiting their turn to be hanged; so to cheer them up, I did but\ncry out, 'Courage, tout le monde, le dia--\n\n\"Connu! what befell?\"\n\n\"Marry, this. 'Blaspheme not!' quo' the bourreau. 'Plait-il,' say I.\nDoesn't he wheel and wyte on me in a sort of Alsatian French, turning\nall the P's into B's. I had much ado not to laugh in his face.\"\n\n\"Being thyself unable to speak ten words of his language without a\nfault.\"\n\n\"Well, all the world ought to speak French. What avail so many jargons\nexcept to put a frontier atwixt men's hearts?\"\n\n\"But what said he?\"\n\n\"What signifies it what a fool says?\"\n\n\"Oh, not all the words of a fool are folly, or I should not listen to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Well, then, he said, 'Such as begin by making free with the devil's\nname, aye end by doing it with all the names in heaven.' 'Father,' said\nI, 'I am a soldier, and this is but my \"consigne\" or watchword.\" 'Oh,\nthen, it is just a custom?' said he. I not divining the old fox, and\nthinking to clear myself, said, 'Ay, it was.' 'Then that is ten times\nworse,' said he. ''Twill bring him about your ears one of these days. He\nstill comes where he hears his name often called.' Observe! no gratitude\nfor the tidings which neither his missals nor his breviary had ever let\nhim know. Then he was so good as to tell me, soldiers do commonly the\ncrimes for which all other men are broke on the wheel; a savoir murder,\nrape, and pillage.\"\n\n\"And is't not true?\"\n\n\"True or not, it was ill manners,\" replied Denys guardedly. \"And so\nsays this courteous host of mine, 'Being the foes of mankind, why make\nenemies of good spirits into the bargain, by still shouting the names of\nevil ones?' and a lot more stuff.\"\n\n\"Well, but, Denys, whether you hearken his rede, or slight it, wherefore\nblame a man for raising his voice to save your soul?\"\n\n\"How can his voice save my soul, when he keeps turning of his P's into\nB's.\"\n\nGerard was staggered: ere he could recover at this thunderbolt of\nGallicism, Denys went triumphant off at a tangent, and stigmatized all\nmonks as hypocrites. \"Do but look at them, how they creep about and\ncannot eye you like honest men.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Gerard eagerly, \"that modest downcast gaze is part of their\ndiscipline, 'tis 'custodia oculorum'.\"\n\n\"Cussed toads eating hoc hac horum? No such thing; just so looks a\ncut-purse. Can't meet a true man's eye. Doff cowl, monk; and behold,\na thief; don cowl thief, and lo, a monk. Tell me not they will ever be\nable to look God Almighty in the face, when they can't even look a true\nman in the face down here. Ah, here it is, black as ink! into the well\nwe go, comrade. Misericorde, there goes the tinkle already. 'Tis the\nbest of tinkles though; 'tis for dinner: stay, listen! I thought so: the\nwolf in my stomach cried 'Amen!'\" This last statement he confirmed with\ntwo oaths, and marched like a victorious gamecock into the convent,\nthinking by Gerard's silence he had convinced him, and not dreaming how\nprofoundly he had disgusted him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nIn the refectory allusion was made, at the table where Gerard sat,\nto the sudden death of the monk who had undertaken to write out fresh\ncopies of the charter of the monastery, and the rule, etc.\n\nGerard caught this, and timidly offered his services. There was a\nhesitation which he mistook. \"Nay, not for hire, my lords, but for love,\nand as a trifling return for many a good night's lodging the brethren of\nyour order have bestowed on me a poor wayfarer.\"\n\nA monk smiled approvingly; but hinted that the late brother was an\nexcellent penman, and his work could not be continued but by a master.\nGerard on this drew from his wallet with some trepidation a vellum deed,\nthe back of which he had cleaned and written upon by way of specimen.\nThe monk gave quite a start at sight of it, and very hastily went up\nthe hall to the high table, and bending his knee so as just to touch in\npassing the fifth step and the tenth, or last, presented it to the prior\nwith comments. Instantly a dozen knowing eyes were fixed on it, and a\nbuzz of voices was heard; and soon Gerard saw the prior point more than\nonce, and the monk came back, looking as proud as Punch, with a savoury\ncrustade ryal, or game pie gravied and spiced, for Gerard, and a silver\ngrace cup full of rich pimentum. This latter Gerard took, and bowing\nlow, first to the distant prior, then to his own company, quaffed, and\ncirculated the cup.\n\nInstantly, to his surprise, the whole table hailed him as a brother:\n\"Art convent bred, deny it not?\" He acknowledged it, and gave Heaven\nthanks for it, for otherwise he had been as rude and ignorant as his\nbrothers, Sybrandt and Cornelis.\n\n\"But 'tis passing strange how you could know,\" said he.\n\n\"You drank with the cup in both hands,\" said two monks, speaking\ntogether.\n\nThe voices had for some time been loudish round a table at the bottom\nof the hall; but presently came a burst of mirth so obstreperous and\nprolonged, that the prior sent the very sub-prior all down the hall to\ncheck it, and inflict penance on every monk at the table. And Gerard's\ncheek burned with shame; for in the heart of the unruly merriment his\near had caught the word \"courage!\" and the trumpet tones of Denys of\nBurgundy.\n\nSoon Gerard was installed in feu Werter's cell, with wax lights, and a\nlittle frame that could be set at any angle, and all the materials of\ncaligraphy. The work, however, was too much for one evening. Then came\nthe question, how could he ask Denys, the monk-hater, to stay longer?\nHowever, he told him, and offered to abide by his decision. He was\nagreeably surprised when Denys said graciously, \"A day's rest will do\nneither of us harm. Write thou, and I'll pass the time as I may.\"\n\nGerard's work was vastly admired; they agreed that the records of the\nmonastery had gained by poor Werter's death. The sub-prior forced a\nrix-dollar on Gerard, and several brushes and colours out of the convent\nstock, which was very large. He resumed his march warm at heart, for\nthis was of good omen; since it was on the pen he relied to make\nhis fortune and recover his well-beloved. \"Come, Denys,\" said he\ngood-humouredly, \"see what the good monks have given me; now, do try to\nbe fairer to them; for to be round with you, it chilled my friendship\nfor a moment to hear even you call my benefactors 'hypocrites.'\"\n\n\"I recant,\" said Denys.\n\n\"Thank you! thank you! Good Denys.\"\n\n\"I was a scurrilous vagabond.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, say not so, neither!\"\n\n\"But we soldiers are rude and hasty. I give myself the lie, and I offer\nthose I misunderstood all my esteem. 'Tis unjust that thousands should\nbe defamed for the hypocrisy of a few.\"\n\n\"Now are you reasonable. You have pondered what I said?\"\n\n\"Nay, it is their own doing.\"\n\nGerard crowed a little, we all like to be proved in the right; and\nwas all attention when Denys offered to relate how his conversion was\neffected.\n\n\"Well then, at dinner the first day a young monk beside me did open his\njaws and laughed right out and most musically. 'Good,' said I, 'at last\nI have fallen on a man and not a shorn ape.' So, to sound him further,\nI slapped his broad back and administered my consigne. 'Heaven forbid!'\nsays he. I stared. For the dog looked as sad as Solomon; a better mime\nsaw you never, even at a Mystery. 'I see war is no sharpener of the\nwits,' said he. 'What are the clergy for but to fight the foul fiend?\nand what else are the monks for?\n\n     \"The fiend being dead,\n     The friars are sped.\"\n\nYou may plough up the convents, and we poor monks shall have nought to\ndo--but turn soldiers, and so bring him to life again.' Then there was a\ngreat laugh at my expense. 'Well, you are the monk for me,' said I. 'And\nyou are the crossbowman for me,' quo' he. 'And I'll be bound you could\ntell us tales of the war should make our hair stand on end.' 'Excusez!\nthe barber has put that out of the question,' quoth I, and then I had\nthe laugh.\"\n\n\"What wretched ribaldry!\" observed Gerard pensively.\n\nThe candid Denys at once admitted he had seen merrier jests hatched with\nless cackle. \"'Twas a great matter to have got rid of hypocrisy. 'So,'\nsaid I, 'I can give you the chaire de poule, if that may content ye.'\n'That we will see,' was the cry, and a signal went round.\"\n\nDenys then related, bursting with glee, how at bedtime he had been taken\nto a cell instead of the great dortour, and strictly forbidden to sleep;\nand to aid his vigil, a book had been lent him of pictures representing\na hundred merry adventures of monks in pursuit of the female laity;\nand how in due course he had been taken out barefooted and down to the\nparlour, where was a supper fit for the duke, and at it twelve jolly\nfriars, the roaringest boys he had ever met in peace or war. How the\nstory, the toast, the jest, the wine-cup had gone round, and some\nhad played cards with a gorgeous pack, where Saint Theresa, and Saint\nCatherine, etc., bedizened with gold, stood for the four queens; and\nblack, white, grey, and crutched friars for the four knaves; and had\nstaked their very rosaries, swearing like troopers when they lost. And\nhow about midnight a sly monk had stolen out, but had by him and others\nbeen as cannily followed into the garden, and seen to thrust his hand\ninto the ivy and out with a rope-ladder. With this he had run up on\nthe wall, which was ten feet broad, yet not so nimbly but what a russet\nkirtle had popped up from the outer world as quick as he; and so to\nbilling and cooing: that this situation had struck him as rather feline\nthan ecclesiastical, and drawn from him the appropriate comment of a\n\"mew!\" The monks had joined the mewsical chorus, and the lay visitor\nshrieked and been sore discomforted; but Abelard only cried, \"What, are\nye there, ye jealous miauling knaves? ye shall caterwaul to some tune\nto-morrow night. I'll fit every man-jack of ye with a fardingale.\" That\nthis brutal threat had reconciled him to stay another day--at Gerard's\nrequest.\n\nGerard groaned.\n\nMeantime, unable to disconcert so brazen a monk, and the demoiselle\nbeginning to whimper, they had danced caterwauling in a circle, then\nbestowed a solemn benediction on the two wall-flowers, and off to\nthe parlour, where they found a pair lying dead drunk, and other\ntwo affectionate to tears. That they had straightway carried off the\ninanimate, and dragged off the loving and lachymose, kicked them all\nmerrily each into his cell.\n\n\"And so shut up in measureless content.\"\n\nGerard was disgusted: and said so.\n\nDenys chuckled, and proceeded to tell him how the next day he and the\nyoung monks had drawn the fish-ponds and secreted much pike, carp,\ntench, and eel for their own use: and how, in the dead of night, he had\nbeen taken shoeless by crooked ways into the chapel, a ghost-like place,\nbeing dark, and then down some steps into a crypt below the chapel\nfloor, where suddenly paradise had burst on him.\n\n\"'Tis there the holy fathers retire to pray,\" put in Gerard.\n\n\"Not always,\" said Denys; \"wax candles by the dozen were lighted, and\nprincely cheer; fifteen soups maigre, with marvellous twangs of venison,\ngrouse, and hare in them, and twenty different fishes (being Friday),\ncooked with wondrous art, and each he between two buxom lasses, and each\nlass between two lads with a cowl; all but me: and to think I had to woo\nby interpreter. I doubt the knave put in three words for himself and\none for me; if he didn't, hang him for a fool. And some of the weaker\nvessels were novices, and not wont to hold good wine; had to be coaxed\nere they would put it to their white teeth; mais elles s'y faisaient;\nand the story, and the jest, and the cup went round (by-the-by, they had\nflagons made to simulate breviaries); and a monk touched the cittern,\nand sang ditties with a voice tunable as a lark in spring. The posies\ndid turn the faces of the women folk bright red at first: but elles s'y\nfaisaient.\"\n\nHere Gerard exploded.\n\n\"Miserable wretches! Corrupters of youth! Perverters of innocence! but\nfor your being there, Denys, who have been taught no better, oh,\nwould God the church had fallen on the whole gang. Impious, abominable\nhypocrites!\"\n\n\"Hypocrites?\" cried Denys, with unfeigned surprise. \"Why, that is what I\nclept them ere I knew them: and you withstood me. Nay, they are sinners;\nall good fellows are that; but, by St. Denys his helmeted skull, no\nhypocrites, but right jolly roaring blades.\"\n\n\"Denys,\" said Gerard solemnly, \"you little know the peril you ran that\nnight. That church you defiled amongst you is haunted; I had it from\none of the elder monks. The dead walk there, their light feet have been\nheard to patter o'er the stones.\"\n\n\"Misericorde!\" whispered Denys.\n\n\"Ay, more,\" said Gerard, lowering his voice almost to a whisper;\n\"celestial sounds have issued from the purlieus of that very crypt you\nturned into a tavern. Voices of the dead holding unearthly communion\nhave chilled the ear of midnight, and at times, Denys, the faithful in\ntheir nightly watches have even heard music from dead lips; and chords,\nmade by no mortal finger, swept by no mortal hand, have rung faintly,\nlike echoes, deep among the dead in those sacred vaults.\"\n\nDenys wore a look of dismay. \"Ugh! if I had known, mules and wain-ropes\nhad not hauled me thither; and so\" (with a sigh) \"I had lost a merry\ntime.\"\n\nWhether further discussion might have thrown any more light upon these\nghostly sounds, who can tell? for up came a \"bearded brother\" from the\nmonastery, spurring his mule, and waving a piece of vellum in his hand.\nIt was the deed between Ghysbrecht and Floris Brandt. Gerard valued it\ndeeply as a remembrance of home: he turned pale at first but to think he\nhad so nearly lost it, and to Denys's infinite amusement not only gave a\npiece of money to the lay brother, but kissed the mule's nose.\n\n\"I'll read you now,\" said Gerard, \"were you twice as ill written;\nand--to make sure of never losing you\"--here he sat down, and taking out\nneedle and thread, sewed it with feminine dexterity to his doublet, and\nhis mind, and heart, and soul were away to Sevenbergen.\n\nThey reached the promised land, and Denys, who was in high spirits,\ndoffed his bonnet to all the females; who curtsied and smiled in return;\nfired his consigne at most of the men; at which some stared, some\ngrinned, some both; and finally landed his friend at one of the\nlong-promised Burgundian inns.\n\n\"It is a little one,\" said he, \"but I know it of old for a good one;\nLes Trois Poissons.' But what is this writ up? I mind not this;\" and he\npointed to an inscription that ran across the whole building in a single\nline of huge letters. \"Oh, I see. 'Ici on loge a pied et a cheval,'\"\nsaid Denys, going minutely through the inscription, and looking\nbumptious when he had effected it.\n\nGerard did look, and the sentence in question ran thus:\n\n\"ON NE LOGE CEANS A CREDIT; CE BONHOMME EST MORT, LES MAUVAIS PAIEURS\nL'ONT TUE.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nThey met the landlord in the passage.\n\n\"Welcome, messieurs,\" said he, taking off his cap, with a low bow.\n\n\"Come, we are not in Germany,\" said Gerard.\n\nIn the public room they found the mistress, a buxom woman of forty. She\ncurtsied to them, and smiled right cordially \"Give yourself the trouble\nof sitting ye down, fair sir,\" said she to Gerard, and dusted two chairs\nwith her apron, not that they needed it.\n\n\"Thank you, dame,\" said Gerard. \"Well,\" thought he, \"this is a polite\nnation: the trouble of sitting down? That will I with singular patience;\nand presently the labour of eating, also the toil of digestion, and\nfinally, by Hercules his aid, the strain of going to bed, and the\nstruggle of sinking fast asleep.\n\n\"Why, Denys, what are you doing? ordering supper for only two?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"What, can we sup without waiting for forty more? Burgundy forever!\"\n\n\"Aha! Courage, camarade. Le dia--\"\n\n\"C'est convenu.\"\n\nThe salic law seemed not to have penetrated to French inns. In this one\nat least wimple and kirtle reigned supreme; doublets and hose were few\nin number, and feeble in act. The landlord himself wandered objectless,\neternally taking off his cap to folk for want of thought; and the women,\nas they passed him in turn, thrust him quietly aside without looking at\nhim, as we remove a live twig in bustling through a wood.\n\nA maid brought in supper, and the mistress followed her, empty handed.\n\n\"Fall to, my masters,\" said she cheerily; \"y'have but one enemy here;\nand he lies under your knife.\" (I shrewdly suspect this of formula.)\n\nThey fell to. The mistress drew her chair a little toward the table; and\nprovided company as well as meat; gossiped genially with them like old\nacquaintances: but this form gone through, the busy dame was soon off\nand sent in her daughter, a beautiful young woman of about twenty,\nwho took the vacant seat. She was not quite so broad and genial as the\nelder, but gentle and cheerful, and showed a womanly tenderness for\nGerard on learning the distance the poor boy had come, and had to go.\nShe stayed nearly half-an-hour, and when she left them Gerard said,\n\"This an inn? Why, it is like home.\"\n\n\"Qui fit Francois il fit courtois,\" said Denys, bursting with gratified\npride.\n\n\"Courteous? nay, Christian; to welcome us like home guests and old\nfriends, us vagrants, here to-day and gone to-morrow. But indeed who\nbetter merits pity and kindness than the worn traveller far from his\nfolk? Hola! here's another.\"\n\nThe new-comer was the chambermaid, a woman of about twenty-five, with\na cocked nose, a large laughing mouth, and a sparkling black eye, and a\nbare arm very stout but not very shapely.\n\nThe moment she came in, one of the travellers passed a somewhat free\njest on her; the next the whole company were roaring at his expense,\nso swiftly had her practised tongue done his business. Even as, in\na passage of arms between a novice and a master of fence, foils\nclash--novice pinked. On this another, and then another, must break a\nlance with her; but Marion stuck her great arms upon her haunches, and\nheld the whole room in play. This country girl possessed in perfection\nthat rude and ready humour which looks mean and vulgar on paper, but\ncarries all before it spoken: not wit's rapier; its bludgeon. Nature had\ndone much for her in this way, and daily practice in an inn the rest.\n\nYet shall she not be photographed by me, but feebly indicated: for it\nwas just four hundred years ago, the raillery was coarse, she returned\nevery stroke in kind, and though a virtuous woman, said things without\nwinking, which no decent man of our day would say even among men.\n\nGerard sat gaping with astonishment. This was to him almost a new\nvariety of \"that interesting species,\" homo. He whispered \"Denys, Now\nI see why you Frenchmen say 'a woman's tongue is her sword:'\" just then\nshe levelled another assailant; and the chivalrous Denys, to console\nand support \"the weaker vessel,\" the iron kettle among the clay pots,\nadministered his consigne, \"Courage, ma mie, le---\" etc.\n\nShe turned on him directly. \"How can he be dead as long as there is an\narcher left alive?\" (General laughter at her ally's expense.)\n\n\"It is 'washing day,' my masters,\" said she, with sudden gravity.\n\n\"Apres? We travellers cannot strip and go bare while you wash our\nclothes,\" objected a peevish old fellow by the fireside, who had kept\nmumchance during the raillery, but crept out into the sunshine of\ncommonplaces.\n\n\"I aimed not your way, ancient man,\" replied Marion superciliously. \"But\nsince you ask me\" (here she scanned him slowly from head to foot), \"I\ntrow you might take a turn in the tub, clothes and all, and no harm\ndone\" (laughter). \"But what I spoke for, I thought this young sire might\nlike his beard starched.\"\n\nPoor Gerard's turn had come; his chin crop was thin and silky.\n\nThe loudest of all the laughers this time was the traitor Denys, whose\nbeard was of a good length, and singularly stiff and bristly; so that\nShakespeare, though he never saw him, hit him in the bull's eye.\n\n     \"Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard.\"\n     --As You Like It.\n\nGerard bore the Amazonian satire mighty calmly. He had little personal\nvanity. \"Nay, 'chambriere,'\" said he, with a smile, \"mine is all\nunworthy your pains; take you this fair growth in hand!\" and he pointed\nto Denys's vegetable.\n\n\"Oh, time for that, when I starch the besoms.\"\n\nWhilst they were all shouting over this palpable hit, the mistress\nreturned, and in no more time than it took her to cross the threshold,\ndid our Amazon turn to a seeming Madonna meek and mild.\n\nMistresses are wonderful subjugators. Their like I think breathes not\non the globe. Housemaids, decide! It was a waste of histrionic ability\nthough; for the landlady had heard, and did not at heart disapprove, the\npeals of laughter.\n\n\"Ah, Marion, lass,\" said she good-humouredly, \"if you laid me an\negg every time you cackle, 'L'es Trois Poissons' would never lack an\nomelet.\"\n\n\"Now, dame,\" said Gerard, \"what is to pay?\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"Our supper.\"\n\n\"Where is the hurry? cannot you be content to pay when you go? lose the\nguest, find the money, is the rule of 'The Three Fish.'\"\n\n\"But, dame, outside 'The Three Fish' it is thus written--'Ici-on ne\nloge--\"\n\n\"Bah! Let that flea stick on the wall! Look hither,\" and she pointed\nto the smoky ceiling, which was covered with hieroglyphics. These were\naccounts, vulgo scores; intelligible to this dame and her daughter, who\nwrote them at need by simply mounting a low stool, and scratching with\na knife so as to show lines of ceiling through the deposit of smoke. The\ndame explained that the writing on the wall was put there to frighten\nmoneyless folk from the inn altogether, or to be acted on at odd times\nwhen a non-paying face should come in and insist on being served. \"We\ncan't refuse them plump, you know. The law forbids us.\"\n\n\"And how know you mine is not such a face?\"\n\n\"Out fie! it is the best face that has entered 'The Three Fish' this\nautumn.\"\n\n\"And mine, dame?\" said Denys; \"dost see no knavery here?\"\n\nShe eyed him calmly. \"Not such a good one as the lad's; nor ever will\nbe. But it is the face of a true man. For all that,\" added she drily,\n\"an I were ten years younger, I'd as lieve not meet that face on a dark\nnight too far from home.\"\n\nGerard stared. Denys laughed. \"Why, dame, I would but sip the night dew\noff the flower; and you needn't take ten years off, nor ten days, to be\nworth risking a scratched face for.\"\n\n\"There, our mistress,\" said Marion, who had just come in, \"said I not\nt'other day you could make a fool of them still, an if you were properly\nminded?\"\n\n\"I dare say ye did; it sounds like some daft wench's speech.\"\n\n\"Dame,\" said Gerard, \"this is wonderful.\"\n\n\"What? Oh! no, no, that is no wonder at all. Why, I have been here all\nmy life; and reading faces is the first thing a girl picks up in an\ninn.\"\n\nMarion. \"And frying eggs the second; no, telling lies; frying eggs is\nthe third, though.\"\n\nThe Mistress. \"And holding her tongue the last, and modesty the day\nafter never at all.\"\n\nMarion. \"Alack! Talk of my tongue. But I say no more. She under whose\nwing I live now deals the blow. I'm sped--'tis but a chambermaid gone.\nCatch what's left on't!\" and she staggered and sank backwards on to the\nhandsomest fellow in the room, which happened to be Gerard.\n\n\"Tic! tic!\" cried he peevishly; \"there, don't be stupid! that is too\nheavy a jest for me. See you not I am talking to the mistress?\"\n\nMarion resumed her elasticity with a grimace, made two little bounds\ninto the middle of the floor, and there turned a pirouette. \"There,\nmistress,\" said she, \"I give in; 'tis you that reigns supreme with the\nmen, leastways with male children.\"\n\n\"Young man,\" said the mistress, \"this girl is not so stupid as her\ndeportment; in reading of faces, and frying of omelets, there we are\ngreat. 'Twould be hard if we failed at these arts, since they are about\nall we do know.\"\n\n\"You do not quite take me, dame,\" said Gerard. \"That honesty in a face\nshould shine forth to your experienced eye, that seems reasonable: but\nhow by looking on Denys here could you learn his one little foible, his\ninsanity, his miserable mulierosity?\" Poor Gerard got angrier the more\nhe thought of it.\n\n\"His mule--his what?\" (crossing herself with superstitious awe at the\npolysyllable).\n\n\"Nay, 'tis but the word I was fain to invent for him.\"\n\n\"Invent? What, can a child like you make other words than grow in\nBurgundy by nature? Take heed what ye do! why, we are overrun with them\nalready, especially bad ones. Lord, these be times. I look to hear of a\nnew thistle invented next.\"\n\n\"Well then, dame, mulierose--that means wrapped up, body and soul,\nin women. So prithee tell me; how did you ever detect the noodle's\nmulierosity?\"\n\n\"Alas! good youth, you make a mountain of a molehill. We that are women\nbe notice-takers; and out of the tail of our eye see more than most men\ncan, glaring through a prospect glass. Whiles I move to and fro doing\nthis and that, my glance is still on my guests, and I did notice that\nthis soldier's eyes were never off the womenfolk: my daughter, or\nMarion, or even an old woman like me, all was gold to him: and there a\nsat glowering; oh, you foolish, foolish man! Now you still turned to the\nspeaker, her or him, and that is common sense.\"\n\nDenys burst into a hoarse laugh. \"You never were more out. Why, this\nsilky, smooth-faced companion is a very Turk--all but his beard. He is\nwhat d'ye call 'em oser than ere an archer in the Duke's body-guard. He\nis more wrapped up in one single Dutch lass called Margaret, than I am\nin the whole bundle of ye, brown and fair.\"\n\n\"Man alive, that is just the contrary,\" said the hostess. \"Yourn is the\nbane, and hisn the cure. Cling you still to Margaret, my dear. I hope\nshe is an honest girl.\"\n\n\"Dame, she is an angel.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, they are all that till better acquainted. I'd as lieve have her\nno more than honest, and then she will serve to keep you out of worse\ncompany. As for you, soldier, there is trouble in store for you. Your\neyes were never made for the good of your soul.\"\n\n\"Nor of his pouch either,\" said Marion, striking in, \"and his lips, they\nwill sip the dew, as he calls it, off many a bramble bush.\"\n\n\"Overmuch clack! Marion overmuch clack.\"\n\n\"Ods bodikins, mistress; ye didn't hire me to be one o' your three\nfishes, did ye?\" and Marion sulked thirty seconds.\n\n\"Is that the way to speak to our mistress?\" remonstrated the landlord,\nwho had slipped in.\n\n\"Hold your whisht,\" said his wife sharply; \"it is not your business to\ncheck the girl; she is a good servant to you.\"\n\n\"What, is the cock never to crow, and the hens at it all day?\"\n\n\"You can crow as loud as you like, my man out o' doors. But the hen\nmeans to rule the roost.\"\n\n\"I know a byword to that tune.\" said Gerard.\n\n\"Do ye, now? out wi't then.\"\n\n     \"Femme veut en toute saison,\n     Estre dame en sa mason.\"\n\n\"I never heard it afore; but 'tis as sooth as gospel. Ay, they that\nset these bywords a rolling had eyes and tongues, and tongues and eyes.\nBefore all the world give me an old saw.\"\n\n\"And me a young husband,\" said Marion. \"Now there was a chance for you\nall, and nobody spoke. Oh! it is too late now, I've changed my mind.\"\n\n\"All the better for some poor fellow,\" suggested Denys.\n\nAnd now the arrival of the young mistress, or, as she was called, the\nlittle mistress, was the signal for them all to draw round the fire,\nlike one happy family, travellers, host, hostess, and even servants in\nthe outer ring, and tell stories till bedtime. And Gerard in his turn\ntold a tremendous one out of his repertory, a MS. collection of \"acts of\nthe saints,\" and made them all shudder deliciously; but soon after began\nto nod, exhausted by the effort, I should say. The young mistress saw,\nand gave Marion a look. She instantly lighted a rush, and laying her\nhand on Gerard's shoulder, invited him to follow her. She showed him a\nroom where were two nice white beds, and bade him choose.\n\n\"Either is paradise,\" said he. \"I'll take this one. Do you know, I have\nnot lain in a naked bed once since I left my home in Holland.\"\n\n\"Alack! poor soul!\" said she; \"well, then, the sooner my flax and your\ndown (he! he!) come together, the better; so--allons!\" and she held out\nher cheek as business-like as if it had been her hand for a fee.\n\n\"Allons? what does that mean?\"\n\n\"It means 'good-night.' Ahem! What, don't they salute the chambermaid in\nyour part?\"\n\n\"Not all in a moment.\"\n\n\"What, do they make a business on't?\"\n\n\"Nay, perverter of words, I mean we make not so free with strange women.\n\n\"They must be strange women if they do not think you strange fools,\nthen. Here is a coil. Why, all the old greasy greybeards that lie at our\ninn do kiss us chambermaids; faugh! and what have we poor wretches to\nset on t'other side the compt but now and then a nice young----? Alack!\ntime flies, chambermaids can't be spared long in the nursery, so how\nis't to be?\"\n\n\"An't please you arrange with my comrade for both. He is mulierose; I am\nnot.\"\n\n\"Nay, 'tis the curb he will want, not the spur. Well! well! you shall\nto bed without paying the usual toll; and oh, but 'tis sweet to fall\nin with a young man who can withstand these ancient ill customs, and\ngainsay brazen hussies. Shalt have thy reward.\"\n\n\"Thank you! But what are you doing with my bed?\"\n\n\"Me? oh, only taking off these sheets, and going to put on the pair the\ndrunken miller slept in last night.\"\n\n\"Oh, no! no! You cruel, black-hearted thing! There! there!\"\n\n\"A la bonne heure! What will not perseverance effect? But note now the\nfrowardness of a mad wench! I cared not for't a button. I am dead sick\nof that sport this five years. But you denied me; so then forthwith I\nbehoved to have it; belike had gone through fire and water for't. Alas,\nyoung sir, we women are kittle cattle; poor perverse toads: excuse us:\nand keep us in our place, savoir, at arm's length; and so good-night!\"\n\nAt the door she turned and said, with a complete change of tone and\nmanner: \"The Virgin guard thy head, and the holy Evangelists watch the\nbed where lies a poor young wanderer far from home! Amen!\"\n\nAnd the next moment he heard her run tearing down the stairs, and soon a\npeal of laughter from the salle betrayed her whereabouts.\n\n\"Now that is a character,\" said Gerard profoundly, and yawned over the\ndiscovery.\n\nIn a very few minutes he was in a dry bath of cold, clean linen,\ninexpressibly refreshing to him after so long disuse: then came a\ndelicious glow; and then--Sevenbergen.\n\n\nIn the morning Gerard awoke infinitely refreshed, and was for rising,\nbut found himself a close prisoner. His linen had vanished. Now this\nwas paralysis; for the nightgown is a recent institution. In Gerard's\ncentury, and indeed long after, men did not play fast and loose with\nclean sheets (when they could get them), but crept into them clothed\nwith their innocence, like Adam: out of bed they seem to have taken most\nafter his eldest son.\n\nGerard bewailed his captivity to Denys; but that instant the door\nopened, and in sailed Marion with their linen, newly washed and ironed,\non her two arms, and set it down on the table.\n\n\"Oh you good girl,\" cried Gerard.\n\n\"Alack, have you found me out at last?\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed. Is this another custom?\"\n\n\"Nay, not to take them unbidden: but at night we aye question\ntravellers, are they for linen washed. So I came into you, but you were\nboth sound. Then said I to the little mistress, 'La! where is the sense\nof waking wearied men, t'ask them is Charles the Great dead, and would\nthey liever carry foul linen or clean, especially this one with a skin\nlike cream? 'And so he has, I declare,' said the young mistress.\"\n\n\"That was me,\" remarked Denys, with the air of a commentator.\n\n\"Guess once more, and you'll hit the mark.\"\n\n\"Notice him not, Marion, he is an impudent fellow; and I am sure we\ncannot be grateful enough for your goodness, and I am sorry I ever\nrefused you--anything you fancied you should like.\"\n\n\"Oh, are ye there,\" said l'espiegle. \"I take that to mean you would\nfain brush the morning dew off, as your bashful companion calls it; well\nthen, excuse me, 'tis customary, but not prudent. I decline. Quits with\nyou, lad.\"\n\n\"Stop! stop!\" cried Denys, as she was making off victorious, \"I am\ncurious to know how many, of ye were here last night a-feasting your\neyes on us twain.\n\n\"'Twas so satisfactory a feast as we weren't half a minute over't. Who?\nwhy the big mistress, the little mistress, Janet, and me, and the whole\nposse comitatus, on tiptoe. We mostly make our rounds the last thing,\nnot to get burned down; and in prodigious numbers. Somehow that maketh\nus bolder, especially where archers lie scattered about.\"\n\n\"Why did not you tell me? I'd have lain awake.\"\n\n\"Beau sire, the saying goes that the good and the ill are all one while\ntheir lids are closed. So we said, 'Here is one who will serve God best\nasleep, Break not his rest!'\"\n\n\"She is funny,\" said Gerard dictatorially.\n\n\"I must be either that or knavish.\"\n\n\"How so?\"\n\n\"Because 'The Three Fish' pay me to be funny. You will eat before you\npart? Good! then I'll go see the meat be fit for such worshipful teeth.\"\n\n\"Denys!\"\n\n\"What is your will?\"\n\n\"I wish that was a great boy, and going along with us, to keep us\ncheery.\"\n\n\"So do not I. But I wish it was going along with us as it is.\"\n\n\"Now Heaven forefend! A fine fool you would make of yourself.\"\n\n\nThey broke their fast, settled their score, and said farewell. Then\nit was they found that Marion had not exaggerated the \"custom of the\ncountry.\" The three principal women took and kissed them right heartily,\nand they kissed the three principal women. The landlord took and kissed\nthem, and they kissed the landlord; and the cry was, \"Come back, the\nsooner the better!\"\n\n\"Never pass 'The Three Fish'; should your purses be void, bring\nyourselves: 'le sieur credit' is not dead for you.\"\n\nAnd they took the road again.\n\nThey came to a little town, and Denys went to buy shoes. The shopkeeper\nwas in the doorway, but wide awake. He received Denys with a bow down\nto the ground. The customer was soon fitted, and followed to the street,\nand dismissed with graceful salutes from the doorstep.\n\nThe friends agreed it was Elysium to deal with such a shoemaker as this.\n\"Not but what my German shoes have lasted well enough,\" said Gerard the\njust.\n\nOutside the town was a pebbled walk.\n\n\"This is to keep the burghers's feet dry, a-walking o' Sundays with\ntheir wives and daughters,\" said Denys.\n\nThose simple words of Denys, one stroke of a careless tongue, painted\n\"home\" in Gerard's heart. \"Oh, how sweet!\" said he.\n\n\"Mercy! what is this? A gibbet! and ugh, two skeletons thereon!\nOh, Denys, what a sorry sight to woo by!\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Denys, \"a comfortable sight; for every rogue i' the air\nthere is one the less a-foot.\"\n\nA little farther on they came to two pillars, and between these was a\nhuge wheel closely studded with iron prongs; and entangled in these were\nbones and fragments of cloth miserably dispersed over the wheel.\n\nGerard hid his face in his hands. \"Oh, to think those patches and bones\nare all that is left of a man! of one who was what we are now.\"\n\n\"Excusez! a thing that went on two legs and stole; are we no more than\nthat?\"\n\n\"How know ye he stole? Have true men never suffered death and torture\ntoo?\"\n\n\"None of my kith ever found their way to the gibbet, I know.\"\n\n\"The better their luck. Prithee, how died the saints?\"\n\n\"Hard. But not in Burgundy.\"\n\n\"Ye massacred them wholesale at Lyons, and that is on Burgundy's\nthreshold. To you the gibbet proves the crime, because you read not\nstory. Alas! had you stood on Calvary that bloody day we sigh for to\nthis hour, I tremble to think you had perhaps shouted for joy at the\ngibbet builded there; for the cross was but the Roman gallows, Father\nMartin says.\"\n\n\"The blaspheming old hound!\"\n\n\"Oh, fie! fie! a holy and a book-learned man. Ay, Denys, y'had read\nthem, that suffered there, by the bare light of the gibbet. 'Drive\nin the nails!' y'had cried: 'drive in the spear!' Here be three\nmalefactors. Three 'roues.' Yet of those little three one was the first\nChristian saint, and another was the Saviour of the world which gibbeted\nhim.\"\n\nDenys assured him on his honour they managed things better in Burgundy.\nHe added, too, after profound reflection, that the horrors Gerard had\nalluded to had more than once made him curse and swear with rage when\ntold by the good cure in his native village at Eastertide: \"but they\nchanced in an outlandish nation, and near a thousand years agone. Mort\nde ma vie, let us hope it is not true; or at least sore exaggerated. Do\nbut see how all tales gather as they roll!\"\n\nThen he reflected again, and all in a moment turned red with ire. \"Do\nye not blush to play with your book-craft on your unlettered friend, and\nthrow dust in his eyes, evening the saints with these reptiles?\"\n\nThen suddenly he recovered his good humour. \"Since your heart beats for\nvermin, feel for the carrion crows! they be as good vermin as these;\nwould ye send them to bed supperless, poor pretty poppets? Why, these\nbe their larder; the pangs of hunger would gnaw them dead, but for cold\ncut-purse hung up here and there.\"\n\nGerard, who had for some time maintained a dead silence, informed him\nthe subject was closed between them, and for ever. \"There are things,\"\nsaid he, \"in which our hearts seem wide as the poles asunder, and eke\nour heads. But I love thee dearly all the same,\" he added, with infinite\ngrace and tenderness.\n\nTowards afternoon they heard a faint wailing noise on ahead; it grew\ndistincter as they proceeded. Being fast walkers they soon came up with\nits cause: a score of pikemen, accompanied by several constables, were\nmarching along, and in advance of them was a herd of animals they were\ndriving. These creatures, in number rather more than a hundred, were of\nvarious ages, only very few were downright old: the males were downcast\nand silent. It was the females from whom all the outcry came. In other\nwords, the animals thus driven along at the law's point were men and\nwomen.\n\n\"Good Heaven!\" cried Gerard, \"what a band of them! But stay, surely all\nthose children cannot be thieves; why, there are some in arms. What on\nearth is this, Denys?\"\n\nDenys advised him to ask that \"bourgeois\" with the badge; \"This is\nBurgundy: here a civil question ever draws a civil reply.\"\n\nGerard went up to the officer, and removing his cap, a civility which\nwas immediately returned, said, \"For our Lady's sake, sir, what do ye\nwith these poor folk?\"\n\n\"Nay, what is that to you, my lad?\" replied the functionary\nsuspiciously.\n\n\"Master, I'm a stranger, and athirst for knowledge.\"\n\n\"That is another matter. What are we doing? ahem. Why we--Dost hear,\nJacques? Here is a stranger seeks to know what we are doing,\" and the\ntwo machines were tickled that there should be a man who did not know\nsomething they happened to know. In all ages this has tickled. However,\nthe chuckle was brief and moderated by the native courtesy, and the\nofficial turned to Gerard again. \"What we are doing? hum!\" and now he\nhesitated, not from any doubt as to what he was doing, but because he\nwas hunting for a single word that should convey the matter.\n\n\"Ce que nous faisons, mon gars?--Mais--dam--NOUS TRANSVASONS.\"\n\n\"You decant? that should mean you pour from one vessel to another.\"\n\n\"Precisely.\" He explained that last year the town of Charmes had been\nsore thinned by a pestilence, whole houses emptied and trades short of\nhands. Much ado to get in the rye, and the flax half spoiled. So the\nbailiff and aldermen had written to the duke's secretary; and the duke\nhe sent far and wide to know what town was too full. \"That are we,\" had\nthe baillie of Toul writ back. \"Then send four or five score of your\ntownsfolk,\" was the order. \"Was not this to decant the full town into\nthe empty, and is not the good duke the father of his people, and will\nnot let the duchy be weakened, nor its fair towns laid waste by sword\nnor pestilence; but meets the one with pike, and arbalest (touching his\ncap to the sergeant and Denys alternately), and t'other with policy?\nLONG LIVE THE DUKE!\"\n\nThe pikemen of course were not to be outdone in loyalty; so they shouted\nwith stentorian lungs \"LONG LIVE THE DUKE!\" Then the decanted ones,\npartly because loyalty was a non-reasoning sentiment in those days,\npartly perhaps because they feared some further ill consequence should\nthey alone be mute, raised a feeble, tremulous shout, \"Long live the\nDuke!\"\n\nBut, at this, insulted nature rebelled. Perhaps indeed the sham\nsentiment drew out the real, for, on the very heels of that royal noise,\na loud and piercing wail burst from every woman's bosom, and a deep,\ndeep groan from every man's; oh! the air filled in a moment with womanly\nand manly anguish. Judge what it must have been when the rude pikemen\nhalted unbidden, all confused; as if a wall of sorrow had started up\nbefore them.\n\n\"En avant,\" roared the sergeant, and they marched again, but muttering\nand cursing.\n\n\"Ah the ugly sound,\" said the civilian, wincing. \"Les malheureux!\" cried\nhe ruefully: for where is the single man can hear the sudden agony of\na multitude and not be moved? \"Les ingrats! They are going whence\nthey were de trop to where they will be welcome: from starvation to\nplenty--and they object. They even make dismal noises. One would think\nwe were thrusting them forth from Burgundy.\"\n\n\"Come away,\" whispered Gerard, trembling; \"come away,\" and the friends\nstrode forward.\n\nWhen they passed the head of the column, and saw the men walk with their\neyes bent in bitter gloom upon the ground, and the women, some carrying,\nsome leading little children, and weeping as they went, and the poor\nbairns, some frolicking, some weeping because \"their mammies\" wept,\nGerard tried hard to say a word of comfort, but choked and could utter\nnothing to the mourners; but gasped, \"Come on, Denys, I cannot mock such\nsorrow with little words of comfort.\" And now, artist-like, all his aim\nwas to get swiftly out of the grief he could not soothe. He almost ran\nnot to hear these sighs and sobs.\n\n\"Why, mate,\" said Denys, \"art the colour of a lemon. Man alive, take not\nother folk's troubles to heart! not one of those whining milksops there\nbut would see thee, a stranger, hanged without winking.\"\n\nGerard scarce listened to him.\n\n\"Decant them?\" he groaned; \"ay, if blood were no thicker than wine.\nPrinces, ye are wolves. Poor things! Poor things! Ah, Denys! Denys!\nwith looking on their grief mine own comes home to me. Well-a-day! ah,\nwell-a-day!\"\n\n\"Ay, now you talk reason. That you, poor lad, should be driven all the\nway from Holland to Rome is pitiful indeed. But these snivelling curs,\nwhere is their hurt? There is six score of 'em to keep one another\ncompany: besides, they are not going out of Burgundy.\"\n\n\"Better for them if they had never been in it.\"\n\n\"Mechant, va! they are but going from one village to another, a mule's\njourney! whilst thou--there, no more. Courage, camarade, le diable est\nmort.\"\n\nGerard shook his head very doubtfully, but kept silence for about a\nmile, and then he said thoughtfully, \"Ay, Denys, but then I am sustained\nby booklearning. These are simple folk that likely thought their village\nwas the world: now what is this? more weeping. Oh! 'tis a sweet world\nHumph! A little girl that hath broke her pipkin. Now may I hang on one\nof your gibbets but I'll dry somebody's tears,\" and he pounced savagely\nupon this little martyr, like a kite on a chick, but with more generous\nintentions. It was a pretty little lass of about twelve; the tears were\nraining down her two peaches, and her palms lifted to heaven in that\nutter, though temporary, desolation which attends calamity at twelve;\nand at her feet the fatal cause, a broken pot, worth, say the fifth of a\nmodern farthing.\n\n\"What, hast broken thy pot, little one?\" said Gerard, acting intensest\nsympathy.\n\n\"Helas! bel gars; as you behold;\" and the hands came down from the sky\nand both pointed at the fragments. A statuette of adversity.\n\n\"And you weep so for that?\"\n\n\"Needs I must, bel gars. My mammy will massacre me. Do they not already\"\n(with a fresh burst of woe) \"c-c-call me J-J-Jean-net-on C-c-casse tout?\nIt wanted but this; that I should break my poor pot. Helas! fallait-il\ndonc, mere de Dieu?\"\n\n\"Courage, little love,\" said Gerard; \"'tis not thy heart lies broken;\nmoney will soon mend pots. See now, here is a piece of silver, and\nthere, scarce a stone's throw off, is a potter; take the bit of silver\nto him, and buy another pot, and the copper the potter will give thee\nkeep that to play with thy comrades.\"\n\nThe little mind took in all this, and smiles began to struggle with the\ntears: but spasms are like waves, they cannot go down the very moment\nthe wind of trouble is lulled. So Denys thought well to bring up his\nreserve of consolation \"Courage, ma mie, le diable est mort!\" cried that\ninventive warrior gaily. Gerard shrugged his shoulders at such a way of\ncheering a little girl,\n\n     \"What a fine thing\n     Is a lute with one string,\"\n\nsaid he.\n\nThe little girl's face broke into warm sunshine.\n\n\"Oh, the good news! oh, the good news!\" she sang out with such heartfelt\njoy, it went off into a honeyed whine; even as our gay old tunes have\na pathos underneath \"So then,\" said she, \"they will no longer be able to\nthreaten us little girls with him, making our lives a burden!\" And she\nbounded off \"to tell Nanette,\" she said.\n\nThere is a theory that everything has its counterpart; if true, Denys it\nwould seem had found the mind his consigne fitted.\n\nWhile he was roaring with laughter at its unexpected success and\nGerard's amazement, a little hand pulled his jerkin and a little face\npeeped round his waist. Curiosity was now the dominant passion in that\nsmall but vivid countenance.\n\n\"Est-ce toi qui l'a tue, beau soldat?\"\n\n\"Oui, ma mie,\" said Denys, as gruffly as ever he could, rightly deeming\nthis would smack of supernatural puissance to owners of bell-like\ntrebles. \"C'est moi. Ca vaut une petite embrassade--pas?\"\n\n\"Je crois ben. Aie! aie!\"\n\n\"Qu'as-tu?\"\n\n\"Ca pique! ca pique!\"\n\n\"Quel dommage! je vais la couper.\"\n\n\"Nein, ce n'est rien; et pisque t'as tue ce mechant. T'es fierement\nbeau, tout d' meme, toi; t'es lien miex que ma grande soeur.\n\n\"Will you not kiss me, too, ma mie?\" said Gerard.\n\n\"Je ne demande par miex. Tiens, tiens, tiens! c'est doulce celle-ci. Ah!\nque j'aimons les hommes! Des fames, ca ne m'aurait jamais donne l'arjan,\nblanc, plutot ca m'aurait ri au nez. C'est si peu de chose, les fames.\nServiteur, beaulx sires! Bon voiage; et n'oubliez point la Jeanneton!\"\n\n\"Adieu, petit coeur,\" said Gerard, and on they marched; but presently\nlooking back they saw the contemner of women in the middle of the road,\nmaking them a reverence, and blowing them kisses with little May morning\nface.\n\n\"Come on,\" cried Gerard lustily. \"I shall win to Rome yet. Holy St.\nBavon, what a sunbeam of innocence hath shot across our bloodthirsty\nroad! Forget thee, little Jeanneton? not likely, amidst all this\nslobbering, and gibbeting, and decanting. Come on, thou laggard!\nforward!\"\n\n\"Dost call this marching?\" remonstrated Denys; \"why, we shall walk o'er\nChristmas Day and never see it.\"\n\nAt the next town they came to, suddenly an arbalestrier ran out of a\ntavern after them, and in a moment his beard and Denys's were like two\nbrushes stuck together. It was a comrade. He insisted on their coming\ninto the tavern with him, and breaking a bottle of wine. In course of\nconversation, he told Denys there was an insurrection in the Duke's\nFlemish provinces, and soldiers were ordered thither from all parts of\nBurgundy. \"Indeed, I marvelled to see thy face turned this way.\n\n\"I go to embrace my folk that I have not seen these three years. Ye can\nquell a bit of a rising without me I trow.\"\n\nSuddenly Denys gave a start. \"Dost hear Gerard? this comrade is bound\nfor Holland.\"\n\n\"What then? ah, a letter! a letter to Margaret! but will he be so good,\nso kind?\"\n\nThe soldier with a torrent of blasphemy informed him he would not only\ntake it, but go a league or two out of his way to do it.\n\nIn an instant out came inkhorn and paper from Gerard's wallet; and he\nwrote a long letter to Margaret, and told her briefly what I fear I have\nspun too tediously; dwelt most on the bear, and the plunge in the Rhine,\nand the character of Denys, whom he painted to the life. And with many\nendearing expressions bade her to be of good cheer; some trouble and\nperil there had been, but all that was over now, and his only grief left\nwas, that he could not hope to have a word from her hand till he should\nreach Rome. He ended with comforting her again as hard as he could. And\nso absorbed was he in his love and his work, that he did not see all the\npeople in the room were standing peeping, to watch the nimble and true\nfinger execute such rare penmanship.\n\nDenys, proud of his friend's skill, let him alone, till presently the\nwriter's face worked, and soon the scalding tears began to run down his\nyoung cheeks, one after another, on the paper where he was then writing\ncomfort, comfort. Then Denys rudely repulsed the curious, and asked his\ncomrade with a faltering voice whether he had the heart to let so sweet\na love-letter miscarry? The other swore by the face of St. Luke he would\nlose the forefinger of his right hand sooner.\n\nSeeing him so ready, Gerard charged him also with a short, cold letter\nto his parents; and in it he drew hastily with his pen two hands\ngrasping each other, to signify farewell. By-the-by, one drop of\nbitterness found its way into his letter to Margaret. But of that anon.\n\nGerard now offered money to the soldier. He hesitated, but declined it.\n\"No, no! art comrade of my comrade; and may\" (etc.) \"but thy love for\nthe wench touches me. I'll break another bottle at thy charge an thou\nwilt, and so cry quits.\"\n\n\"Well said, comrade,\" cried Denys. \"Hadst taken money, I had invited\nthee to walk in the courtyard and cross swords with me.\"\n\n\"Whereupon I had cut thy comb for thee,\" retorted the other.\n\n\"Hadst done thy endeavour, drole, I doubt not.\"\n\nThey drank the new bottle, shook hands, adhered to custom, and parted on\nopposite routes.\n\nThis delay, however, somewhat put out Denys's calculations, and evening\nsurprised them ere they reached a little town he was making for, where\nwas a famous hotel. However, they fell in with a roadside auberge, and\nDenys, seeing a buxom girl at the door, said, \"This seems a decent\ninn,\" and led the way into the kitchen. They ordered supper, to which\nno objection was raised, only the landlord requested them to pay for it\nbeforehand. It was not an uncommon proposal in any part of the world.\nStill it was not universal, and Denys was nettled, and dashed his hand\nsomewhat ostentatiously into his purse and pulled out a gold angel.\n\"Count me the change, and speedily,\" said he. \"You tavern-keepers are\nmore likely to rob me than I you.\"\n\nWhile the supper was preparing, Denys disappeared, and was eventually\nfound by Gerard in the yard, helping Manon, his plump but not bright\ndecoy duck, to draw water, and pouring extravagant compliments into her\ndullish ear. Gerard grunted and returned to table, but Denys did not\ncome in for a good quarter of an hour.\n\n\"Uphill work at the end of a march,\" said he, shrugging his shoulders.\n\n\"What matters that to you!\" said Gerard drily. \"The mad dog bites all\nthe world.\"\n\n\"Exaggerator. You know I bite but the fairer half. Well, here comes\nsupper; that is better worth biting.\"\n\nDuring supper the girl kept constantly coming in and out, and looking\npoint-blank at them, especially at Denys; and at last in leaning over\nhim to remove a dish, dropped a word in his ear; and he replied with a\nnod.\n\nAs soon as supper was cleared away, Denys rose and strolled to the door,\ntelling Gerard the sullen fair had relented, and given him a little\nrendezvous in the stable-yard.\n\nGerard suggested that the calf-pen would have been a more appropriate\nlocality. \"I shall go to bed, then,\" said he, a little crossly. \"Where\nis the landlord? out at this time of night? no matter. I know our room.\nShall you be long, pray?\"\n\n\"Not I. I grudge leaving the fire and thee. But what can I do? There are\ntwo sorts of invitations a Burgundian never declines.\"\n\nDenys found a figure seated by the well. It was Manon; but instead\nof receiving him as he thought he had a right to expect, coming by\ninvitation, all she did was to sob. He asked her what ailed her? She\nsobbed. Could he do anything for her? She sobbed.\n\nThe good-natured Denys, driven to his wits' end, which was no great\ndistance, proffered the custom of the country by way of consolation. She\nrepulsed him roughly. \"Is it a time for fooling?\" said she, and sobbed.\n\n\"You seem to think so,\" said Denys, waxing wroth. But the next moment he\nadded tenderly, \"and I, who could never bear to see beauty in distress.\"\n\n\"It is not for myself.\"\n\n\"Who then? your sweetheart?\"\n\n\"Oh, que nenni. My sweetheart is not on earth now: and to think I have\nnot an ecu to buy masses for his soul;\" and in this shallow nature the\ngrief seemed now to be all turned in another direction.\n\n\"Come, come,\" said Denys, \"shalt have money to buy masses for thy dead\nlad; I swear it. Meantime tell me why you weep.\"\n\n\"For you.\"\n\n\"For me? Art mad?\"\n\n\"No; I am not mad. 'Tis you that were mad to open your purse before\nhim.\"\n\nThe mystery seemed to thicken, and Denys, wearied of stirring up the\nmud by questions, held his peace to see if it would not clear of itself.\nThen the girl, finding herself no longer questioned, seemed to go\nthrough some internal combat. At last she said, doggedly and aloud, \"I\nwill. The Virgin give me courage? What matters it if they kill me, since\nhe is dead? Soldier, the landlord is out.\"\n\n\"Oh, is he?\"\n\n\"What, do landlords leave their taverns at this time of night? also\nsee what a tempest! We are sheltered here, but t'other side it blows a\nhurricane.\"\n\nDenys said nothing.\n\n\"He is gone to fetch the band.\"\n\n\"The band! what band?\"\n\n\"Those who will cut your throat and take your gold. Wretched man; to go\nand shake gold in an innkeeper's face!\"\n\nThe blow came so unexpectedly it staggered even Denys, accustomed as he\nwas to sudden perils. He muttered a single word, but in it a volume.\n\n\"Gerard!\"\n\n\"Gerard! What is that? Oh, 'tis thy comrade's name, poor lad. Get him\nout quick ere they come; and fly to the next town.\"\n\n\"And thou?\"\n\n\"They will kill me.\"\n\n\"That shall they not. Fly with us.\"\n\n\"'Twill avail me nought: one of the band will be sent to kill me. They\nare sworn to slay all who betray them.\"\n\n\"I'll take thee to my native place full thirty leagues from hence, and\nput thee under my own mother's wing, ere they shall hurt a hair o' thy\nhead. But first Gerard. Stay thou here whilst I fetch him!\"\n\nAs he was darting off, the girl seized him convulsively, and with all\nthe iron strength excitement lends to women. \"Stay me not! for pity's\nsake,\" he cried; \"'tis life or death.\"\n\n\"Sh!--sh!\" whispered the girl, shutting his mouth hard with her hand,\nand putting her pale lips close to him, and her eyes, that seemed to\nturn backwards, straining towards some indistinct sound.\n\nHe listened.\n\nHe heard footsteps, many footsteps, and no voices. She whispered in his\near, \"They are come.\" And trembled like a leaf.\n\nDenys felt it was so. Travellers in that number would never have come in\ndead silence.\n\nThe feet were now at the very door.\n\n\"How many?\" said he, in a hollow whisper.\n\n\"Hush!\" and she put her mouth to his very ear. And who, that had seen\nthis man and woman in that attitude, would have guessed what freezing\nhearts were theirs, and what terrible whispers passed between them?\n\n\"How armed?\"\n\n\"Sword and dagger: and the giant with his axe. They call him the Abbot.\"\n\n\"And my comrade?\"\n\n\"Nothing can save him. Better lose one life than two. Fly!\"\n\nDenys's blood froze at this cynical advice. \"Poor creature, you know not\na soldier's heart.\"\n\nHe put his head in his hands a moment, and a hundred thoughts of dangers\nbaffled whirled through his brain.\n\n\"Listen, girl! There is one chance for our lives, if thou wilt but be\ntrue to us. Run to the town; to the nearest tavern, and tell the first\nsoldier there, that a soldier here is sore beset, but armed, and his\nlife to be saved if they will but run. Then to the bailiff. But first\nto the soldiers. Nay, not a word, but buss me, good lass, and fly! men's\nlives hang on thy heels.\"\n\nShe kilted up her gown to run. He came round to the road with her, saw\nher cross the road cringing with fear, then glide away, then turn into\nan erect shadow, then melt away in the storm.\n\nAnd now he must get to Gerard. But how? He had to run the gauntlet of\nthe whole band. He asked himself, what was the worst thing they could\ndo? for he had learned in war that an enemy does, not what you hope he\nwill do, but what you hope he will not do. \"Attack me as I enter the\nkitchen! Then I must not give them time.\"\n\nJust as he drew near to the latch, a terrible thought crossed him.\n\"Suppose they had already dealt with Gerard. Why, then,\" thought he,\n\"nought is left but to kill, and be killed;\" and he strung his bow, and\nwalked rapidly into the kitchen. There were seven hideous faces seated\nround the fire, and the landlord pouring them out neat brandy, blood's\nforerunner in every age.\n\n\"What? company!\" cried Denys gaily; \"one minute, my lads, and I'll be\nwith you;\" and he snatched up a lighted candle off the table, opened the\ndoor that led to the staircase, and went up it hallooing. \"What, Gerard!\nwhither hast thou skulked to?\" There was no answer. He hallooed louder,\n\"Gerard, where art thou?\"\n\nAfter a moment, in which Denys lived an hour of agony, a peevish,\nhalf-inarticulate noise issued from the room at the head of the little\nstairs. Denys burst in, and there was Gerard asleep.\n\n\"Thank God!\" he said, in a choking voice, then began to sing loud,\nuntuneful ditties. Gerard put his fingers into his ears; but presently\nhe saw in Denys's face a horror that contrasted strangely with this\nsudden merriment.\n\n\"What ails thee?\" said he, sitting up and staring.\n\n\"Hush!\" said Denys, and his hand spoke even more plainly than his lips.\n\"Listen to me.\"\n\nDenys then pointing significantly to the door, to show Gerard sharp ears\nwere listening hard by, continued his song aloud but under cover of it\nthrew in short muttered syllables.\n\n\"(Our lives are in peril.)\n\n\"(Thieves.)\n\n\"(Thy doublet.)\n\n\"(Thy sword.)\n\n\"Aid.\n\n\"Coming.\n\n\"Put off time.\" Then aloud--\n\n\"Well, now, wilt have t'other bottle?--Say nay.\"\n\n\"No, not I.\"\n\n\"But I tell thee, there are half-a-dozen jolly fellows. Tired.\"\n\n\"Ay, but I am too wearied,\" said Gerard. \"Go thou.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay!\" Then he went to the door and called out cheerfully\n\"Landlord, the young milksop will not rise. Give those honest fellows\nt'other bottle. I will pay for't in the morning.\"\n\nHe heard a brutal and fierce chuckle.\n\nHaving thus by observation made sure the kitchen door was shut, and the\nmiscreants were not actually listening, he examined the chamber door\nclosely: then quietly shut it, but did not bolt it; and went and\ninspected the window.\n\nIt was too small to get out of, and yet a thick bar of iron had been\nlet in the stone to make it smaller; and just as he made this chilling\ndiscovery, the outer door of the house was bolted with a loud clang.\n\nDenys groaned. \"The beasts are in the shambles.\"\n\nBut would the thieves attack them while they were awake? Probably not.\n\nNot to throw away this their best chance, the poor souls now made a\nseries of desperate efforts to converse, as if discussing ordinary\nmatters; and by this means Gerard learned all that had passed, and that\nthe girl was gone for aid.\n\n\"Pray Heaven she may not lose heart by the way,\" said Denys,\nsorrowfully.\n\nAnd Denys begged Gerard's forgiveness for bringing him out of his way\nfor this.\n\nGerard forgave him.\n\n\"I would fear them less, Gerard, but for one they call the Abbot.\nI picked him out at once. Taller than you, bigger than us both put\ntogether. Fights with an axe. Gerard, a man to lead a herd of deer to\nbattle. I shall kill that man to-night, or he will kill me. I think\nsomehow 'tis he will kill me.\"\n\n\"Saints forbid! Shoot him at the door! What avails his strength against\nyour weapon?\"\n\n\"I shall pick him out; but if it comes to hand fighting, run swiftly\nunder his guard, or you are a dead man. I tell thee neither of us may\nstand a blow of that axe: thou never sawest such a body of a man.\"\n\nGerard was for bolting the door; but Denys with a sign showed him that\nhalf the door-post turned outward on a hinge, and the great bolt was\nlittle more than a blind. \"I have forborne to bolt it,\" said he, \"that\nthey may think us the less suspicious.\"\n\nNear an hour rolled away thus. It seemed an age. Yet it was but a little\nhour, and the town was a league distant. And some of the voices in the\nkitchen became angry and impatient.\n\n\"They will not wait much longer,\" said Denys, \"and we have no chance at\nall unless we surprise them.\"\n\n\"I will do whate'er you bid,\" said Gerard meekly.\n\nThere was a cupboard on the same side as the door; but between it and\nthe window. It reached nearly to the ground, but not quite. Denys opened\nthe cupboard door and placed Gerard on a chair behind it. \"If they\nrun for the bed, strike at the napes of their necks! a sword cut there\nalways kills or disables.\" He then arranged the bolsters and their shoes\nin the bed so as to deceive a person peeping from a distance, and drew\nthe short curtains at the head.\n\nMeantime Gerard was on his knees. Denys looked round and saw him.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Denys, \"above all, pray them to forgive me for bringing you\ninto this guet-apens!\"\n\nAnd now they grasped hands and looked in one another's eyes oh, such a\nlook! Denys's hand was cold, and Gerard's warm.\n\nThey took their posts.\n\nDenys blew out the candle.\n\n\"We must keep silence now.\"\n\nBut in the terrible tension of their nerves and very souls they found\nthey could hear a whisper fainter than any man could catch at all\noutside that door. They could hear each other's hearts thump at times.\n\n\"Good news!\" breathed Denys, listening at the door. \"They are casting\nlots.\"\n\n\"Pray that it may be the Abbot.\"\n\n\"Yes. Why?\n\n\"If he comes alone I can make sure of him.\"\n\n\"Denys!\"\n\n\"Ay!\"\n\n\"I fear I shall go mad, if they do not come soon.\"\n\n\"Shall I feign sleep? Shall I snore?\"\n\n\"Will that-------?\n\n\"Perhaps\"\n\n\"Do then and God have mercy on us!\"\n\nDenys snored at intervals.\n\nThere was a scuffling of feet heard in the kitchen, and then all was\nstill.\n\nDenys snored again. Then took up his position behind the door.\n\nBut he, or they, who had drawn the lot, seemed determined to run no\nfoolish risks. Nothing was attempted in a hurry.\n\nWhen they were almost starved with cold, and waiting for the attack, the\ndoor on the stairs opened softly and closed again. Nothing more.\n\nThere was another harrowing silence.\n\nThen a single light footstep on the stair; and nothing more.\n\nThen a light crept under the door and nothing more.\n\nPresently there was a gentle scratching, not half so loud as a mouse's,\nand the false door-post opened by degrees, and left a perpendicular\nspace, through which the light streamed in. The door, had it been\nbolted, would now have hung by the bare tip of the bolt, which went into\nthe real door-post, but as it was, it swung gently open of itself. It\nopened inwards, so Denys did not raise his crossbow from the ground, but\nmerely grasped his dagger.\n\nThe candle was held up, and shaded from behind by a man's hand.\n\nHe was inspecting the beds from the threshold, satisfied that his\nvictims were both in bed.\n\nThe man glided into the apartment. But at the first step something in\nthe position of the cupboard and chair made him uneasy. He ventured no\nfurther, but put the candle on the floor and stooped to peer under\nthe chair; but as he stooped, an iron hand grasped his shoulder, and a\ndagger was driven so fiercely through his neck that the point came\nout at his gullet. There was a terrible hiccough, but no cry; and\nhalf-a-dozen silent strokes followed in swift succession, each a\ndeath-blow, and the assassin was laid noiselessly on the floor.\n\nDenys closed the door, bolted it gently, drew the post to, and even\nwhile he was going whispered Gerard to bring a chair. It was done.\n\n\"Help me set him up.\"\n\n\"Dead?\"\n\n\"Parbleu.\"\n\n\"What for?\"\n\n\"Frighten them! Gain time.\"\n\nEven while saying this, Denys had whipped a piece of string round the\ndead man's neck, and tied him to the chair, and there the ghastly figure\nsat fronting the door.\n\n\"Denys, I can do better. Saints forgive me!\"\n\n\"What? Be quick then, we have not many moments.\"\n\nAnd Denys got his crossbow ready, and tearing off his straw mattress,\nreared it before him and prepared to shoot the moment the door should\nopen, for he had no hope any more would come singly, when they found the\nfirst did not return.\n\nWhile thus employed, Gerard was busy about the seated corpse, and to\nhis amazement Denys saw a luminous glow spreading rapidly over the white\nface.\n\nGerard blew out the candle; and on this the corpse's face shone still\nmore like a glowworm's head.\n\nDenys shook in his shoes, and his teeth chattered.\n\n\"What, in Heaven's name, is this?\" he whispered.\n\n\"Hush! 'tis but phosphorus, but 'twill serve.\"\n\n\"Away! they will surprise thee.\"\n\nIn fact, uneasy mutterings were heard below, and at last a deep voice\nsaid, \"What makes him so long? is the drole rifling them?\"\n\nIt was their comrade they suspected then, not the enemy. Soon a step\ncame softly but rapidly up the stairs: the door was gently tried.\n\nWhen this resisted, which was clearly not expected, the sham post was\nvery cautiously moved, and an eye no doubt peeped through the aperture:\nfor there was a howl of dismay, and the man was heard to stumble back\nand burst into the kitchen, here a Babel of voices rose directly on his\nreturn.\n\nGerard ran to the dead thief and began to work on him again.\n\n\"Back, madman!\" whispered Denys.\n\n\"Nay, nay. I know these ignorant brutes; they will not venture here\nawhile. I can make him ten times more fearful.\"\n\n\"At least close that opening! Let them not see you at your devilish\nwork.\"\n\nGerard closed the sham post, and in half a minute his brush gave the\ndead head a sight to strike any man with dismay. He put his art to a\nstrange use, and one unparalleled perhaps in the history of mankind.\nHe illuminated his dead enemy's face to frighten his living foe: the\nstaring eyeballs he made globes of fire; the teeth he left white, for\nso they were more terrible by the contrast; but the palate and tongue\nhe tipped with fire, and made one lurid cavern of the red depths the\nchapfallen jaw revealed: and on the brow he wrote in burning letters\n\"La Mort.\" And, while he was doing it, the stout Denys was quaking, and\nfearing the vengeance of Heaven; for one mans courage is not another's;\nand the band of miscreants below were quarrelling and disputing loudly,\nand now without disguise.\n\nThe steps that led down to the kitchen were fifteen, but they were\nnearly perpendicular: there was therefore in point of fact no distance\nbetween the besiegers and besieged, and the latter now caught almost\nevery word. At last one was heard to cry out, \"I tell ye the devil has\ngot him and branded him with hellfire. I am more like to leave this\ncursed house than go again into a room that is full of fiends.\"\n\n\"Art drunk? or mad? or a coward?\" said another.\n\n\"Call me a coward, I'll give thee my dagger's point, and send thee where\nPierre sits o' fire for ever.\n\n\"Come, no quarrelling when work is afoot,\" roared a tremendous diapason,\n\"or I'll brain ye both with my fist, and send ye where we shall all go\nsoon or late.\"\n\n\"The Abbot,\" whispered Denys gravely.\n\nHe felt the voice he had just heard could belong to no man but the\ncolossus he had seen in passing through the kitchen. It made the place\nvibrate. The quarrelling continued some time, and then there was a dead\nsilence.\n\n\"Look out, Gerard.\"\n\n\"Ay. What will they do next?\"\n\n\"We shall soon know.\"\n\n\"Shall I wait for you, or cut down the first that opens the door?\"\n\n\"Wait for me, lest we strike the same and waste a blow. Alas! we cannot\nafford that.\"\n\nDead silence.\n\nSudden came into the room a thing that made them start and their hearts\nquiver.\n\nAnd what was it? A moonbeam.\n\nEven so can this machine, the body, by the soul's action, be strung\nup to start and quiver. The sudden ray shot keen and pure into that\nshamble.\n\nIts calm, cold, silvery soul traversed the apartment in a stream of no\ngreat volume, for the window was narrow.\n\nAfter the first tremor Gerard whispered, \"Courage, Denys! God's eye\nis on us even here.\" And he fell upon his knees with his face turned\ntowards the window.\n\nAy it was like a holy eye opening suddenly on human crime and human\npassions. Many a scene of blood and crime that pure cold eye had rested\non; but on few more ghastly than this, where two men, with a lighted\ncorpse between them, waited panting, to kill and be killed. Nor did the\nmoonlight deaden that horrible corpse-light. If anything it added to\nits ghastliness: for the body sat at the edge of the moonbeam, which cut\nsharp across the shoulder and the ear, and seemed blue and ghastly and\nunnatural by the side of that lurid glow in which the face and eyes and\nteeth shone horribly. But Denys dared not look that way.\n\nThe moon drew a broad stripe of light across the door, and on that his\neyes were glued. Presently he whispered, \"Gerard!\"\n\nGerard looked and raised his sword.\n\nAcutely as they had listened, they had heard of late no sound on\nthe stair. Yet therein the door-post, at the edge of the stream of\nmoonlight, were the tips of the fingers of a hand.\n\nThe nails glistened.\n\nPresently they began to crawl and crawl down towards the bolt, but\nwith infinite slowness and caution. In so doing they crept into the\nmoonlight. The actual motion was imperceptible, but slowly, slowly,\nthe fingers came out whiter and whiter; but the hand between the main\nknuckles and the wrist remained dark.\n\nDenys slowly raised his crossbow.\n\nHe levelled it. He took a long steady aim.\n\nGerard palpitated. At last the crossbow twanged. The hand was instantly\nnailed, with a stern jar, to the quivering door-post. There was a scream\nof anguish. \"Cut,\" whispered Denys eagerly, and Gerard's uplifted sword\ndescended and severed the wrist with two swift blows. A body sank down\nmoaning outside.\n\nThe hand remained inside, immovable, with blood trickling from it down\nthe wall. The fierce bolt, slightly barbed, had gone through it and deep\ninto the real door-post.\n\n\"Two,\" said Denys, with terrible cynicism.\n\nHe strung his crossbow, and kneeled behind his cover again.\n\n\"The next will be the Abbot.\"\n\nThe wounded man moved, and presently crawled down to his companions on\nthe stairs, and the kitchen door was shut.\n\nThere nothing was heard now but low muttering. The last incident had\nrevealed the mortal character of the weapons used by the besieged.\n\n\"I begin to think the Abbot's stomach is not so great as his body,\" said\nDenys.\n\nThe words were scarcely out of his mouth when the following events\nhappened all in a couple of seconds. The kitchen door was opened\nroughly, a heavy but active man darted up the stairs without any manner\nof disguise, and a single ponderous blow sent the door not only off its\nhinges, but right across the room on to Denys's fortification, which it\nstruck so rudely as nearly to lay him flat. And in the doorway stood a\ncolossus with a glittering axe.\n\nHe saw the dead man with the moon's blue light on half his face, and the\nred light on the other half and inside his chapfallen jaws: he stared,\nhis arms fell, his knees knocked together, and he crouched with terror.\n\n\"LA MORT!\" he cried, in tones of terror, and turned and fled. In which\nact Denys started up and shot him through both jaws. He sprang with one\nbound into the kitchen, and there leaned on his axe, spitting blood and\nteeth and curses.\n\nDenys strung his bow and put his hand into his breast.\n\nHe drew it out dismayed.\n\n\"My last bolt is gone,\" he groaned.\n\n\"But we have our swords, and you have slain the giant.\"\n\n\"No, Gerard,\" said Denys gravely, \"I have not. And the worst is I have\nwounded him. Fool! to shoot at a retreating lion. He had never faced thy\nhandiwork again, but for my meddling.\"\n\n\"Ha! to your guard! I hear them open the door.\"\n\nThen Denys, depressed by the one error he had committed in all this\nfearful night, felt convinced his last hour had come. He drew his sword,\nbut like one doomed. But what is this? a red light flickers on the\nceiling. Gerard flew to the window and looked out. There were men with\ntorches, and breastplates gleaming red. \"We are saved! Armed men!\" And\nhe dashed his sword through the window shouting, \"Quick! quick! we are\nsore pressed.\"\n\n\"Back!\" yelled Denys; \"they come! strike none but him!\"\n\nThat very moment the Abbot and two men with naked weapons rushed into\nthe room. Even as they came, the outer door was hammered fiercely, and\nthe Abbot's comrades hearing it, and seeing the torchlight, turned and\nfled. Not so the terrible Abbot: wild with rage and pain, he spurned his\ndead comrade, chair and all, across the room, then, as the men faced him\non each side with kindling eyeballs, he waved his tremendous axe like a\nfeather right and left, and cleared a space, then lifted it to hew them\nboth in pieces.\n\nHis antagonists were inferior in strength, but not in swiftness and\ndaring, and above all they had settled how to attack him. The moment\nhe reared his axe, they flew at him like cats, and both together. If he\nstruck a full blow with his weapon he would most likely kill one, but\nthe other would certainly kill him: he saw this, and intelligent as\nwell as powerful, he thrust the handle fiercely in Denys's face, and,\nturning, jobbed with the steel at Gerard. Denys went staggering back\ncovered with blood. Gerard had rushed in like lightning, and, just as\nthe axe turned to descend on him, drove his sword so fiercely through\nthe giant's body, that the very hilt sounded on his ribs like the blow\nof a pugilist, and Denys, staggering back to help his friend, saw a\nsteel point come out of the Abbot behind.\n\nThe stricken giant bellowed like a bull, dropped his axe, and clutching\nGerard's throat tremendously, shook him like a child. Then Denys with\na fierce snarl drove his sword into the giant's back. \"Stand firm now!\"\nand he pushed the cold steel through and through the giant and out at\nhis breast.\n\nThus horribly spitted on both sides, the Abbot gave a violent shudder,\nand his heels hammered the ground convulsively. His lips, fast turning\nblue, opened wide and deep, and he cried, \"LA MORT!-LA MORT!-LA MORT!!\"\nthe first time in a roar of despair, and then twice in a horror-stricken\nwhisper, never to be forgotten.\n\nJust then the street door was forced.\n\nSuddenly the Abbot's arms whirled like windmills, and his huge body\nwrenched wildly and carried them to the doorway, twisting their wrists\nand nearly throwing them off their legs.\n\n\"He'll win clear yet,\" cried Denys: \"out steel! and in again!\"\n\nThey tore out their smoking swords, but ere they could stab again,\nthe Abbot leaped full five feet high, and fell with a tremendous crash\nagainst the door below, carrying it away with him like a sheet of paper,\nand through the aperture the glare of torches burst on the awe-struck\nfaces above, half blinding them.\n\nThe thieves at the first alarm had made for the back door, but driven\nthence by a strong guard ran back to the kitchen, just in time to see\nthe lock forced out of the socket, and half-a-dozen mailed archers burst\nin upon them. On these in pure despair they drew their swords.\n\nBut ere a blow was struck on either side, the staircase door behind them\nwas battered into their midst with one ponderous blow, and with it the\nAbbot's body came flying, hurled as they thought by no mortal hand, and\nrolled on the floor spouting blood from back and bosom in two furious\njets, and quivered, but breathed no more.\n\nThe thieves smitten with dismay fell on their knees directly, and the\narchers bound them, while, above, the rescued ones still stood like\nstatues rooted to the spot, their dripping swords extended in the red\ntorchlight, expecting their indomitable enemy to leap back on them as\nwonderfully as he had gone.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\n\"Where be the true men?\"\n\n\"Here be we. God bless you all! God bless you!\"\n\nThere was a rush to the stairs, and half-a-dozen hard but friendly hands\nwere held out and grasped them warmly.\n\n\"Y'have saved our lives, lads,\" cried Denys, \"y'have saved our lives\nthis night.\"\n\nA wild sight met the eyes of the rescued pair. The room flaring with\ntorches, the glittering breastplates of the archers, their bronzed\nfaces, the white cheeks of the bound thieves, and the bleeding giant,\nwhose dead body these hard men left lying there in its own gore.\n\nGerard went round the archers and took them each by the hand with\nglistening eyes, and on this they all kissed him; and this time he\nkissed them in return. Then he said to one handsome archer of his own\nage, \"Prithee, good soldier, have an eye to me. A strange drowsiness\novercomes me. Let no one cut my throat while I sleep--for pity's sake.\"\n\nThe archer promised with a laugh; for he thought Gerard was jesting: and\nthe latter went off into a deep sleep almost immediately.\n\nDenys was surprised at this: but did not interfere; for it suited his\nimmediate purpose. A couple of archers were inspecting the Abbot's body,\nturning it half over with their feet, and inquiring, \"Which of the two\nhad flung this enormous rogue down from an upper storey like that; they\nwould fain have the trick of his arm.\"\n\nDenys at first pished and pshawed, but dared not play the braggart, for\nhe said to himself, \"That young vagabond will break in and say 'twas\nthe finger of Heaven, and no mortal arm, or some such stuff, and make me\nlook like a fool.\" But now, seeing Gerard unconscious, he suddenly gave\nthis required information.\n\n\"Well, then, you see, comrades, I had run my sword through this one up\nto the hilt, and one or two more of 'em came buzzing about me; so it\nbehoved me have my sword or die: so I just put my foot against his\nstomach, gave a tug with my hand and a spring with my foot, and sent him\nflying to kingdom come! He died in the air, and his carrion rolled\nin amongst you without ceremony: made you jump, I warrant me. But\npikestaves and pillage! what avails prattling of, these trifles once\nthey are gone by? buvons, camarades, buvons.\"\n\nThe archers remarked that it was easy to say \"buvons\" where no liquor\nwas, but not so easy to do it.\n\n\"Nay, I'll soon find you liquor. My nose hath a natural alacrity at\nscenting out the wine. You follow me: and I my nose: bring a torch!\" And\nthey left the room, and finding a short flight of stone steps, descended\nthem and entered a large, low, damp cellar.\n\nIt smelt close and dank: and the walls were encrusted here and there\nwith what seemed cobwebs; but proved to be saltpetre that had oozed out\nof the damp stones and crystallized.\n\n\"Oh! the fine mouldy smell,\" said Denys; \"in such places still lurks the\ngood wine; advance thy torch. Diable! what is that in the corner? A pile\nof rags? No: 'tis a man.\"\n\nThey gathered round with the torch, and lo! a figure crouched on a heap\nin the corner, pale as ashes and shivering.\n\n\"Why, it is the landlord,\" said Denys.\n\n\"Get up, thou craven heart!\" shouted one of the archers.\n\n\"Why, man, the thieves are bound, and we are dry that bound them. Up!\nand show us thy wine; for no bottles see here.\"\n\n\"What, be the rascals bound?\" stammered the pale landlord; \"good news.\nW-w-wine? that will I, honest sirs.\"\n\nAnd he rose with unsure joints and offered to lead the way to the wine\ncellar. But Denys interposed. \"You are all in the dark, comrades. He is\nin league with the thieves.\"\n\n\"Alack, good soldier, me in league with the accursed robbers! Is that\nreasonable?\"\n\n\"The girl said so anyway.\"\n\n\"The girl! What girl? Ah! Curse her, traitress!\"\n\n\"Well,\" interposed the other archer; \"the girl is not here, but gone on\nto the bailiff. So let the burghers settle whether this craven be guilty\nor no: for we caught him not in the act: and let him draw us our wine.\"\n\n\"One moment,\" said Denys shrewdly. \"Why cursed he the girl? If he be a\ntrue man, he should bless her as we do.\"\n\n\"Alas, sir!\" said the landlord, \"I have but my good name to live by, and\nI cursed her to you, because you said she had belied me.\"\n\n\"Humph! I trow thou art a thief, and where is the thief that cannot lie\nwith a smooth face? Therefore hold him, comrades: a prisoner can draw\nwine an if his hands be not bound.\"\n\nThe landlord offered no objection; but on the contrary said he would\nwith pleasure show them where his little stock of wine was, but hoped\nthey would pay for what they should drink, for his rent was due this two\nmonths.\n\nThe archers smiled grimly at his simplicity, as they thought it; one of\nthem laid a hand quietly but firmly on his shoulder, the other led on\nwith the torch.\n\nThey had reached the threshold when Denys cried \"Halt!\"\n\n\"What is't?\"\n\n\"Here be bottles in this corner; advance thy light.\"\n\nThe torch-bearer went towards him. He had just taken off his scabbard\nand was probing the heap the landlord had just been crouched upon.\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" cried the landlord, \"the wine is in the next cellar. There\nis nothing there.\"\n\n\"Nothing is mighty hard, then,\" said Denys, and drew out something with\nhis hand from the heap.\n\nIt proved to be only a bone.\n\nDenys threw it on the floor: it rattled.\n\n\"There is nought there but the bones of the house,\" said the landlord.\n\n\"Just now 'twas nothing. Now that we have found something 'tis nothing\nbut bones. Here's another. Humph? look at this one, comrade; and you\ncome too and look at it, and bring you smooth knave along.\"\n\nThe archer with the torch, whose name was Philippe, held the bone to the\nlight and turned it round and round.\n\n\"Well?\" said Denys.\n\n\"Well, if this was a field of battle, I should say 'twas the shankbone\nof a man; no more, no less. But 'tisn't a battlefield, nor a churchyard;\n'tis an inn.\"\n\n\"True, mate; but yon knave's ashy face is as good a light to me as a\nfield of battle. I read the bone by it, Bring yon face nearer, I say.\nWhen the chine is amissing, and the house dog can't look at you without\nhis tail creeping between his legs, who was the thief? Good brothers\nmine, my mind it doth misgive me. The deeper I thrust the more there be.\nMayhap if these bones could tell their tale they would make true men's\nflesh creep that heard it.\"\n\n\"Alas! young man, what hideous fancies are these! The bones are bones\nof beeves, and sheep, and kids, and not, as you think, of men and women.\nHoly saints preserve us!\"\n\n\"Hold thy peace! thy words are air. Thou hast not got burghers by the\near, that know not a veal knuckle from their grandsire's ribs; but\nsoldiers-men that have gone to look for their dear comrades, and found\ntheir bones picked as clean by the crows as these I doubt have been by\nthee and thy mates. Men and women, saidst thou? And prithee, when spake\nI a word of women's bones? Wouldst make a child suspect thee. Field\nof battle, comrade! Was not this house a field of battle half an hour\nagone? Drag him close to me, let me read his face: now then, what is\nthis, thou knave?\" and he thrust a small object suddenly in his face.\n\n\"Alas! I know not.\"\n\n\"Well, I would not swear neither: but it is too like the thumb bone of\na man's hand; mates, my flesh it creeps. Churchyard! how know I this is\nnot one?\"\n\nAnd he now drew his sword out of the scabbard and began to rake the heap\nof earth and broken crockery and bones out on the floor.\n\nThe landlord assured him he but wasted his time. \"We poor innkeepers are\nsinners,\" said he; \"we give short measure and baptize the wine: we are\nfain to do these things; the laws are so unjust to us; but we are not\nassassins. How could we afford to kill our customers? May Heaven's\nlightning strike me dead if there be any bones there but such as have\nbeen used for meat. 'Tis the kitchen wench flings them here: I swear by\nGod's holy mother, by holy Paul, by holy Dominic, and Denys my patron\nsaint--ah!\"\n\nDenys held out a bone under his eye in dead silence. It was a bone no\nman, however ignorant, however lying, could confound with those of sheep\nor oxen. The sight of it shut the lying lips, and palsied the heartless\nheart.\n\nThe landlord's hair rose visibly on his head like spikes, and his knees\ngave way as if his limbs had been struck from under him. But the archers\ndragged him fiercely up, and kept him erect under the torch, staring\nfascinated at the dead skull which, white as the living cheek opposed,\nbut no whiter, glared back again at its murderer, whose pale lip now\nopened and opened, but could utter no sound.\n\n\"Ah!\" said Denys solemnly, and trembling now with rage, \"look on the\nsockets out of which thou hast picked the eyes, and let them blast thine\neyes, that crows shall pick out ere this week shall end. Now, hold thou\nthat while I search on. Hold it, I say, or here I rob the gallows--\" and\nhe threatened the quaking wretch with his naked sword, till with a groan\nhe took the skull and held it, almost fainting.\n\nOh! that every murderer, and contriver of murder, could see him, sick,\nand staggering with terror, and with his hair on end, holding the cold\nskull, and feeling that his own head would soon be like it. And soon\nthe heap was scattered, and alas! not one nor two, but many skulls were\nbrought to light, the culprit moaning at each discovery.\n\nSuddenly Denys uttered a strange cry of distress to come from so bold\nand hard a man; and held up to the torch a mass of human hair. It was\nlong, glossy, and golden. A woman's beautiful hair. At the sight of it\nthe archers instinctively shook the craven wretch in their hands: and he\nwhined.\n\n\"I have a little sister with hair just so fair and shining as this,\"\ngulped Denys. \"Jesu! if it should be hers! There quick, take my sword\nand dagger, and keep them from my hand, lest I strike him dead and wrong\nthe gibbet. And thou, poor innocent victim, on whose head this most\nlovely hair did grow, hear me swear this, on bended knee, never to\nleave this man till I see him broken to pieces on the wheel even for thy\nsake.\"\n\nHe rose from his knee. \"Ay, had he as many lives as here be hairs, I'd\nhave them all, by God,\" and he put the hair into his bosom. Then in a\nsudden fury seized the landlord fiercely by the neck, and forced him to\nhis knees; and foot on head ground his face savagely among the bones\nof his victims, where they lay thickest; and the assassin first yelled,\nthen whined and whimpered, just as a dog first yells, then whines, when\nhis nose is so forced into some leveret or other innocent he has killed.\n\n\"Now lend me thy bowstring, Philippe!\" He passed it through the eyes of\na skull alternately, and hung the ghastly relic of mortality and crime\nround the man's neck; then pulled him up and kicked him industriously\ninto the kitchen, where one of the aldermen of the burgh had arrived\nwith constables, and was even now taking an archer's deposition.\n\nThe grave burgher was much startled at sight of the landlord driven\nin bleeding from a dozen scratches inflicted by the bones of his own\nvictims, and carrying his horrible collar. But Denys came panting after,\nand in a few fiery words soon made all clear.\n\n\"Bind him like the rest,\" said the alderman sternly. \"I count him the\nblackest of them all.\"\n\nWhile his hands were being bound, the poor wretch begged piteously that\n\"the skull might be taken from him.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" said the alderman. \"Certes I had not ordered such a thing to be\nput on mortal man. Yet being there, I will not lift voice nor finger to\ndoff it. Methinks it fits thee truly, thou bloody dog. 'Tis thy ensign,\nand hangs well above a heart so foul as thine.\"\n\nHe then inquired of Denys if he thought they had secured the whole gang,\nor but a part.\n\n\"Your worship,\" said Denys, \"there are but seven of them, and this\nlandlord. One we slew upstairs, one we trundled down dead, the rest are\nbound before you.\"\n\n\"Good! go fetch the dead one from upstairs, and lay him beside him I\ncaused to be removed.\"\n\nHere a voice like a guinea-fowl's broke peevishly in. \"Now, now, now,\nwhere is the hand? that is what I want to see.\" The speaker was a little\npettifogging clerk.\n\n\"You will find it above, nailed to the door-post by a crossbow bolt.\"\n\n\"Good!\" said the clerk. He whispered his master, \"What a goodly show\nwill the 'pieces de conviction' make!\" and with this he wrote them down,\nenumerating them in separate squeaks as he penned them. Skulls--Bones--A\nwoman's hair--A thief's hands 1 axe--2 carcasses--1 crossbow bolt.\nThis done, he itched to search the cellar himself: there might be other\ninvaluable morsels of evidence, an ear, or even an earring. The alderman\nassenting, he caught up a torch and was hurrying thither, when an\naccident stopped him, and indeed carried him a step or two in the\nopposite direction.\n\nThe constables had gone up the stair in single file.\n\nBut the head constable no sooner saw the phosphorescent corpse seated\nby the bedside, than he stood stupefied; and next he began to shake like\none in an ague, and, terror gaining on him more and more, he uttered a\nsort of howl and recoiled swiftly. Forgetting the steps in his recoil,\nhe tumbled over backward on his nearest companion; but he, shaken by the\nshout of dismay, and catching a glimpse of something horrid, was already\nstaggering back, and in no condition to sustain the head constable, who,\nlike most head constables, was a ponderous man. The two carried away the\nthird, and the three the fourth, and they streamed into the kitchen, and\nsettled on the floor, overlapping each other like a sequence laid out on\na card-table. The clerk coming hastily with his torch ran an involuntary\ntilt against the fourth man, who, sharing the momentum of the mass,\nknocked him instantly on his back, the ace of that fair quint; and there\nhe lay kicking and waving his torch, apparently in triumph, but\nreally in convulsion, sense and wind being driven out together by the\nconcussion.\n\n\"What is to do now, in Heaven's name?\" cried the alderman, starting up\nwith considerable alarm. But Denys explained, and offered to accompany\nhis worship. \"So be it,\" said the latter. His men picked themselves\nruefully up, and the alderman put himself at their head and examined the\npremises above and below. As for the prisoners, their interrogatory was\npostponed till they could be confronted with the servant.\n\nBefore dawn, the thieves, alive and dead, and all the relics and\nevidences of crime and retribution, were swept away into the law's\nnet, and the inn was silent and almost deserted. There remained but one\nconstable, and Denys and Gerard, the latter still sleeping heavily.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nGerard awoke, and found Denys watching him with some anxiety.\n\n\"It is you for sleeping! Why, 'tis high noon.\"\n\n\"It was a blessed sleep,\" said Gerard; \"methinks Heaven sent it me. It\nhath put as it were a veil between me and that awful night. To think\nthat you and I sit here alive and well. How terrible a dream I seem to\nhave had!\"\n\n\"Ay, lad, that is the wise way to look at these things when once they\nare past, why, they are dreams, shadows. Break thy fast, and then thou\nwilt think no more on't. Moreover, I promised to bring thee on to the\ntown by noon, and take thee to his worship.\"\n\nGerard then sopped some rye bread in red wine and ate it to break his\nfast: then went with Denys over the scene of combat, and came back\nshuddering, and finally took the road with his friend, and kept peering\nthrough the hedges, and expecting sudden attacks unreasonably, till they\nreached the little town. Denys took him to \"The White Hart\".\n\n\"No fear of cut-throats here,\" said he. \"I know the landlord this many\na year. He is a burgess, and looks to be bailiff. 'Tis here I was making\nfor yestreen. But we lost time, and night o'ertook us--and--\n\n\"And you saw a woman at the door, and would be wiser than a Jeanneton;\nshe told us they were nought.\"\n\n\"Why, what saved our lives if not a woman? Ay, and risked her own to do\nit.\"\n\n\"That is true, Denys; and though women are nothing to me, I long to\nthank this poor girl, and reward her, ay, though I share every doit in\nmy purse with her. Do not you?\"\n\n\"Parbleu.\"\n\n\"Where shall we find her?\"\n\n\"Mayhap the alderman will tell us. We must go to him first.\"\n\nThe alderman received them with a most singular and inexplicable\nexpression of countenance. However, after a moment's reflection, he wore\na grim smile, and finally proceeded to put interrogatories to Gerard,\nand took down the answers. This done, he told them that they must\nstay in the town till the thieves were tried, and be at hand to give\nevidence, on peril of fine and imprisonment. They looked very blank at\nthis.\n\n\"However,\" said he, \"'twill not be long, the culprits having been taken\nred-handed.\" He added, \"And you know, in any case you could not leave\nthe place this week.\"\n\nDenys stared at this remark, and Gerard smiled at what he thought the\nsimplicity of the old gentleman in dreaming that a provincial town of\nBurgundy had attraction to detain him from Rome and Margaret.\n\nHe now went to that which was nearest both their hearts.\n\n\"Your worship,\" said he, \"we cannot find our benefactress in the town.\"\n\n\"Nay, but who is your benefactress?\"\n\n\"Who? why the good girl that came to you by night and saved our lives at\nperil of her own. Oh sir, our hearts burn within us to thank and bless\nher; where is she?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\n\"In prison, sir; good lack, for what misdeed?\"\n\n\"Well, she is a witness, and may be a necessary one.\"\n\n\"Why, Messire Bailiff,\" put in Denys, \"you lay not all your witnesses by\nthe heels I trow.\"\n\nThe alderman, pleased at being called bailiff, became communicative.\n\"In a case of blood we detain all testimony that is like to give us leg\nbail, and so defeat justice, and that is why we still keep the women\nfolk. For a man at odd times hides a week in one mind, but a woman, if\nshe do her duty to the realm o' Friday, she shall undo it afore Sunday,\nor try. Could you see yon wench now, you should find her a-blubbering\nat having betrayed five males to the gallows. Had they been females,\nwe might have trusted to a subpoena. For they despise one another.\nAnd there they show some sense. But now I think on't, there were other\nreasons for laying this one by the heels. Hand me those depositions,\nyoung sir.\" And he put on his glasses. \"Ay! she was implicated; she was\none of the band.\"\n\nA loud disclaimer burst from Denys and Gerard at once.\n\n\"No need to deave me,\" said the alderman. \"Here 'tis in black and white.\n'Jean Hardy (that is one of the thieves), being questioned, confessed\nthat--humph? Ay, here 'tis. 'And that the girl Manon was the decoy,\nand her sweetheart was Georges Vipont, one of the band; and hanged last\nmonth: and that she had been deject ever since, and had openly blamed\nthe band for his death, saying if they had not been rank cowards, he had\nnever been taken, and it is his opinion she did but betray them out of\nvery spite, and--\n\n\"His opinion,\" cried Gerard indignantly; \"what signifies the opinion\nof a cut-throat, burning to be revenged on her who has delivered him to\njustice? And an you go to that, what avails his testimony? Is a thief\nnever a liar? Is he not aye a liar? and here a motive to lie? Revenge,\nwhy, 'tis the strongest of all the passions. And oh, sir, what madness\nto question a detected felon and listen to him lying away an honest\nlife--as if he were a true man swearing in open day, with his true hand\non the Gospel laid!\"\n\n\"Young man,\" said the alderman, \"restrain thy heat in presence of\nauthority! I find by your tone you are a stranger. Know then that in\nthis land we question all the world. We are not so weak as to hope to\nget at the truth by shutting either our left ear or our right.\"\n\n\"And so you would listen to Satan belying the saints!\"\n\n\"Ta! ta! The law meddles but with men and women, and these cannot\nutter a story all lies, let them try ever so. Wherefore we shut not the\nbarn-door (as the saying is) against any man's grain. Only having taken\nit in, we do winnow and sift it. And who told you I had swallowed the\nthief's story whole like fair water? Not so. I did but credit so much\non't as was borne out by better proof.\"\n\n\"Better proof?\" and Gerard looked blank. \"Why, who but the thieves would\nbreathe a word against her?\"\n\n\"Marry, herself.\"\n\n\"Herself, sir? what, did you question her too?\"\n\n\"I tell you we question all the world. Here is her deposition; can you\nread?--Read it yourself, then.\"\n\nGerard looked at Denys and read him Manon's deposition.\n\n\"I am a native of Epinal. I left my native place two years ago because\nI was unfortunate: I could not like the man they bade me. So my father\nbeat me. I ran away from my father. I went to service. I left service\nbecause the mistress was jealous of me. The reason that she gave for\nturning me off was, because I was saucy. Last year I stood in the\nmarketplace to be hired with other girls. The landlord of 'The Fair\nStar' hired me. I was eleven months with him. A young man courted me. I\nloved him. I found out that travellers came and never went away again.\nI told my lover. He bade me hold my peace. He threatened me. I found my\nlover was one of a band of thieves. When travellers were to be robbed,\nthe landlord went out and told the band to come. Then I wept and prayed\nfor the travellers' souls. I never told. A month ago my lover died.\n\n\"The soldier put me in mind of my lover. He was bearded like him I had\nlost. I cannot tell whether I should have interfered, if he had had no\nbeard. I am sorry I told now.\"\n\nThe paper almost dropped from Gerard's hands. Now for the first time he\nsaw that Manon's life was in mortal danger. He knew the dogged law, and\nthe dogged men that executed it. He threw himself suddenly on his knees\nat the alderman's feet. \"Oh, sir! think of the difference between those\ncruel men and this poor weak woman! Could you have the heart to send her\nto the same death with them; could you have the heart to condemn us to\nlook on and see her slaughtered, who, but that she risked her life for\nours, had not now been in jeopardy? Alas, sir! show me and my comrade\nsome pity, if you have none for her, poor soul. Denys and I be true men,\nand you will rend our hearts if you kill that poor simple girl. What\ncan we do? What is left for us to do then but cut our throats at her\ngallows' foot?\"\n\nThe alderman was tough, but mortal; the prayers and agitation of Gerard\nfirst astounded, then touched him. He showed it in a curious way. He\nbecame peevish and fretful. \"There, get up, do,\" said he. \"I doubt\nwhether anybody would say as many words for me. What ho, Daniel!\ngo fetch the town clerk.\" And on that functionary entering from an\nadjoining room, \"Here is a foolish lad fretting about yon girl. Can\nwe stretch a point? say we admit her to bear witness, and question her\nfavourably.\"\n\nThe town clerk was one of your \"impossibility\" men.\n\n\"Nay, sir, we cannot do that: she was not concerned in this business.\nHad she been accessory, we might have offered her a pardon to bear\nwitness.\"\n\nGerard burst in, \"But she did better. Instead of being accessory, she\nstayed the crime; and she proffered herself as witness by running hither\nwith the tale.\"\n\n\"Tush, young man, 'tis a matter of law.\" The alderman and the clerk then\nhad a long discussion, the one maintaining, the other denying, that she\nstood as fair in law as if she had been accessory to the attempt on\nour travellers' lives. And this was lucky for Manon: for the alderman,\nirritated by the clerk reiterating that he could not do this, and could\nnot that, and could not do t'other, said \"he would show him he could do\nanything he chose,\" And he had Manon out, and upon the landlord of \"The\nWhite Hart\" being her bondsman, and Denys depositing five gold pieces\nwith him, and the girl promising, not without some coaxing from Denys,\nto attend as a witness, he liberated her, but eased his conscience by\ntelling her in his own terms his reason for this leniency.\n\n\"The town had to buy a new rope for everybody hanged, and present it\nto the bourreau, or compound with him in money: and she was not in his\nopinion worth this municipal expense, whereas decided characters like\nher late confederates, were.\" And so Denys and Gerard carried her off,\nGerard dancing round her for joy, Denys keeping up her heart by\nassuring her of the demise of a troublesome personage, and she weeping\ninauspiciously. However, on the road to \"The White Hart\" the public\nfound her out, and having heard the whole story from the archers, who\nnaturally told it warmly in her favour, followed her hurrahing and\nencouraging her, till finding herself backed by numbers she plucked up\nheart. The landlord too saw at a glance that her presence in the inn\nwould draw custom, and received her politely, and assigned her an upper\nchamber: here she buried herself, and being alone rained tears again.\n\nPoor little mind, it was like a ripple, up and down, down and up, up and\ndown. Bidding the landlord be very kind to her, and keep her a prisoner\nwithout letting her feel it, the friends went out: and lo! as they\nstepped into the street they saw two processions coming towards them\nfrom opposite sides. One was a large one, attended with noise and howls\nand those indescribable cries by which rude natures reveal at odd times\nthat relationship to the beasts of the field and forest, which at other\ntimes we succeed in hiding. The other, very thinly attended by a few\nnuns and friars, came slow and silent.\n\nThe prisoners going to exposure in the market-place. The gathered bones\nof the victims coming to the churchyard.\n\nAnd the two met in the narrow street nearly at the inn door, and could\nnot pass each other for a long time, and the bier, that bore the relics\nof mortality, got wedged against the cart that carried the men who had\nmade those bones what they were, and in a few hours must die for it\nthemselves. The mob had not the quick intelligence to be at once struck\nwith this stern meeting: but at last a woman cried, \"Look at your work,\nye dogs!\" and the crowd took it like wildfire, and there was a horrible\nyell, and the culprits groaned and tried to hide their heads upon their\nbosoms, but could not, their hands being tied. And there they stood,\nimages of pale hollow-eyed despair, and oh how they looked on the bier,\nand envied those whom they had sent before them on the dark road they\nwere going upon themselves! And the two men who were the cause of both\nprocessions stood and looked gravely on, and even Manon, hearing the\ndisturbance, crept to the window, and, hiding her face, peeped trembling\nthrough her fingers, as women will.\n\nThis strange meeting parted Denys and Gerard. The former yielded\nto curiosity and revenge, the latter doffed his bonnet, and piously\nfollowed the poor remains of those whose fate had so nearly been his\nown. For some time he was the one lay mourner: but when they had reached\nthe suburbs, a long way from the greater attraction that was filling the\nmarket-place, more than one artisan threw down his tools, and more\nthan one shopman left his shop, and touched with pity or a sense of our\ncommon humanity, and perhaps decided somewhat by the example of Gerard,\nfollowed the bones bareheaded, and saw them deposited with the prayers\nof the Church in hallowed ground.\n\nAfter the funeral rites Gerard stepped respectfully up to the cure, and\noffered to buy a mass for their souls.\n\nGerard, son of Catherine, always looked at two sides of a penny: and he\ntried to purchase this mass a trifle under the usual terms, on account\nof the pitiable circumstances. But the good cure gently but adroitly\nparried his ingenuity, and blandly screwed him up to the market price.\n\nIn the course of the business they discovered a similarity of\nsentiments. Piety and worldly prudence are not very rare companions:\nstill it is unusual to carry both so far as these two men did. Their\ncollision in the prayer market led to mutual esteem, as when knight\nencountered knight worthy of his steel. Moreover the good cure loved a\nbit of gossip, and finding his customer was one of those who had fought\nthe thieves at Domfront, would have him into his parlour and hear the\nwhole from his own lips. And his heart warmed to Gerard, and he said\n\"God was good to thee. I thank Him for't with all my soul. Thou art\na good lad.\" He added drily, \"Shouldst have told me this tale in the\nchurchyard. I doubt, I had given thee the mass for love. However,\" said\nhe (the thermometer suddenly falling), \"'tis ill luck to go back upon a\nbargain. But I'll broach a bottle of my old Medoc for thee: and few\nbe the guests I would do that for.\" The cure went to his cupboard, and\nwhile he groped for the choice bottle, he muttered to himself, \"At their\nold tricks again!\"\n\n\"Plait-il?\" said Gerard.\n\n\"I said nought. Ay, here 'tis.\"\n\n\"Nay, your reverence. You surely spoke: you said, 'At their old tricks\nagain!'\"\n\n\"Said I so in sooth?\" and his reverence smiled. He then proceeded to\nbroach the wine, and filled a cup for each. Then he put a log of wood on\nthe fire, for stoves were none in Burgundy. \"And so I said 'At their old\ntricks!' did I? Come, sip the good wine, and, whilst it lasts, story for\nstory, I care not if I tell you a little tale.\"\n\nGerard's eyes sparkled.\n\n\"Thou lovest a story?\"\n\n\"As my life.\"\n\n\"Nay, but raise not thine expectations too high, neither. 'Tis but a\nfoolish trifle compared with thine adventures.\"\n\nTHE CURE'S TALE.\n\n\"Once upon a time, then, in the kingdom of France, and in the duchy\nof Burgundy, and not a day's journey from the town where now we sit\na-sipping of old Medoc, there lived a cure. I say he lived; but barely.\nThe parish was small, the parishioners greedy; and never gave their\ncure a doit more than he could compel. The nearer they brought him to a\ndisembodied spirit by meagre diet, the holier should be his prayers in\ntheir behalf. I know not if this was their creed, but their practice\ngave it colour.\n\n\"At last he pickled a rod for them.\n\n\"One day the richest farmer in the place had twins to baptize. The cure\nwas had to the christening dinner as usual; but ere he would baptize\nthe children, he demanded, not the christening fees only, but the burial\nfees. 'Saints defend us, parson, cried the mother; 'talk not of burying!\nI did never see children liker to live.' 'Nor I,' said the cure, 'the\npraise be to God. Natheless, they are sure to die, being sons of Adam,\nas well as of thee, dame. But die when they will, 'twill cost them\nnothing, the burial fees being paid and entered in this book.' 'For all\nthat 'twill cost them something,' quoth the miller, the greatest wag\nin the place, and as big a knave as any; for which was the biggest God\nknoweth, but no mortal man, not even the hangman. 'Miller, I tell thee\nnay,' quo' the cure. 'Parson, I tell you ay,' quo' the miller. ''Twill\ncost them their lives.' At which millstone conceit was a great laugh;\nand in the general mirth the fees were paid and the Christians made.\n\n\"But when the next parishioner's child, and the next after, and all, had\nto pay each his burial fee, or lose his place in heaven, discontent did\nsecretly rankle in the parish. Well, one fine day they met in\nsecret, and sent a churchwarden with a complaint to the bishop, and a\nthunderbolt fell on the poor cure. Came to him at dinner-time a summons\nto the episcopal palace, to bring the parish books and answer certain\ncharges. Then the cure guessed where the shoe pinched. He left his food\non the board, for small his appetite now, and took the parish books and\nwent quaking.\n\n\"The bishop entertained him with a frown, and exposed the plaint.\n'Monseigneur,' said the cure right humbly, 'doth the parish allege many\nthings against me, or this one only?' 'In sooth, but this one,' said the\nbishop, and softened a little. 'First, monseigneur, I acknowledge the\nfact.' ''Tis well,' quoth the bishop; 'that saves time and trouble. Now\nto your excuse, if excuse there be.' 'Monseigneur, I have been cure of\nthat parish seven years, and fifty children have I baptized, and buried\nnot five. At first I used to say, \"Heaven be praised, the air of this\nvillage is main healthy;\" but on searching the register book I found\n'twas always so, and on probing the matter, it came out that of those\nborn at Domfront, all, but here and there one, did go and get hanged at\nAix. But this was to defraud not their cure only, but the entire Church\nof her dues, since \"pendards\" pay no funeral fees, being buried in air.\nThereupon, knowing by sad experience their greed, and how they grudge\nthe Church every sou, I laid a trap to keep them from hanging; for,\ngreed against greed, there be of them that will die in their beds like\ntrue men ere the Church shall gain those funeral fees for nought.'\nThen the bishop laughed till the tears ran down, and questioned the\nchurchwarden, and he was fain to confess that too many of the parish did\ncome to that unlucky end at Aix. 'Then,' said the bishop, 'I do approve\nthe act, for myself and my successors; and so be it ever, till they\nmend their manners and die in their beds.' And the next day came the\nringleaders crestfallen to the cure, and said, 'Parson, ye were even\ngood to us, barring this untoward matter: prithee let there be no ill\nblood anent so trivial a thing.' And the cure said, 'My children, I were\nunworthy to be your pastor could I not forgive a wrong; go in peace, and\nget me as many children as may be, that by the double fees the cure you\nlove may miss starvation.'\n\n\"And the bishop often told the story, and it kept his memory of the cure\nalive, and at last he shifted him to a decent parish, where he can offer\na glass of old Medoc to such as are worthy of it. Their name it is not\nlegion.\"\n\nA light broke in upon Gerard, his countenance showed it.\n\n\"Ay!\" said his host, \"I am that cure: so now thou canst guess why I said\n'At their old tricks.' My life on't they have wheedled my successor into\nremitting those funeral fees. You are well out of that parish. And so am\nI.\"\n\nThe cure's little niece burst in, \"Uncle, the weighing--la! a stranger!\"\nAnd burst out.\n\nThe cure rose directly, but would not part with Gerard.\n\n\"Wet thy beard once more, and come with me.\"\n\nIn the church porch they found the sexton with a huge pair of scales,\nand weights of all sizes. Several humble persons were standing by, and\nsoon a woman stepped forward with a sickly child and said, \"Be it heavy\nbe it light, I vow, in rye meal of the best, whate'er this child shall\nweigh, and the same will duly pay to Holy Church, an if he shall cast\nhis trouble. Pray, good people, for this child, and for me his mother\nhither come in dole and care!\"\n\nThe child was weighed, and yelled as if the scale had been the font.\n\n\"Courage! dame,\" cried Gerard. \"This is a good sign. There is plenty of\nlife here to battle its trouble.\"\n\n\"Now, blest be the tongue that tells me so,\" said the poor woman. She\nhushed her ponderling against her bosom, and stood aloof watching,\nwhilst another woman brought her child to scale.\n\nBut presently a loud, dictatorial voice was heard, \"Way there, make way\nfor the seigneur!\"\n\nThe small folk parted on both sides like waves ploughed by a lordly\ngalley, and in marched in gorgeous attire, his cap adorned by a feather\nwith a topaz at its root, his jerkin richly furred, satin doublet, red\nhose, shoes like skates, diamond-hilted sword in velvet scabbard, and\nhawk on his wrist, \"the lord of the manor.\" He flung himself into the\nscales as if he was lord of the zodiac as well as the manor: whereat the\nhawk balanced and flapped; but stuck: then winked.\n\nWhile the sexton heaved in the great weights, the cure told Gerard, \"My\nlord had been sick unto death, and vowed his weight in bread and cheese\nto the poor, the Church taking her tenth.\"\n\n\"Permit me, my lord; if your lordship continues to press your lordship's\nstaff on the other scale, you will disturb the balance.\"\n\nHis lordship grinned and removed his staff, and leaned on it. The cure\npolitely but firmly objected to that too.\n\n\"Mille diables! what am I to do with it, then?\" cried the other.\n\n\"Deign to hold it out so, my lord, wide of both scales.\"\n\nWhen my lord did this, and so fell into the trap he had laid for\nHoly Church, the good cure whispered to Gerard. \"Cretensis incidit in\nCretensem!\" which I take to mean, \"Diamond cut diamond.\" He then said\nwith an obsequious air, \"If that your lordship grudges Heaven full\nweight, you might set the hawk on your lacquey, and so save a pound.\"\n\n\"Gramercy for thy rede, cure,\" cried the great man, reproachfully.\n\"Shall I for one sorry pound grudge my poor fowl the benefit of Holy\nChurch? I'd as lieve the devil should have me and all my house as her,\nany day i' the year.\"\n\n\"Sweet is affection,\" whispered the cure.\n\n\"Between a bird and a brute,\" whispered Gerard.\n\n\"Tush!\" and the cure looked terrified.\n\nThe seigneur's weight was booked, and Heaven I trust and believe did not\nweigh his gratitude in the balance of the sanctuary. For my unlearned\nreader is not to suppose there was anything the least eccentric in the\nman, or his gratitude to the Giver of health and all good gifts. Men\nlook forward to death, and back upon past sickness with different eyes.\nItem, when men drive a bargain, they strive to get the sunny side of\nit; it matters not one straw whether it is with man or Heaven they are\nbargaining. In this respect we are the same now, at bottom, as we were\nfour hundred years ago: only in those days we did it a grain or two more\nnaively, and that naivete shone out more palpably, because, in that rude\nage, body prevailing over mind, all sentiments took material forms.\nMan repented with scourges, prayed by bead, bribed the saints with wax\ntapers, put fish into the body to sanctify the soul, sojourned in cold\nwater for empire over the emotions, and thanked God for returning health\nin 1 cwt. 2 stone 7 lb 3 oz. 1 dwt. of bread and cheese.\n\nWhilst I have been preaching, who preach so rarely and so ill, the good\ncure has been soliciting the lord of the manor to step into the church,\nand give order what shall be done with his great-great-grandfather.\n\n\"Ods bodikins! what, have you dug him up?\"\n\n\"Nay, my lord, he never was buried.\"\n\n\"What, the old dict was true after all?\"\n\n\"So true that the workmen this very day found a skeleton erect in the\npillar they are repairing. I had sent to my lord at once, but I knew he\nwould be here.\"\n\n\"It is he! 'Tis he!\" said his descendant, quickening his pace. \"Let us\ngo see the old boy. This youth is a stranger, I think.\"\n\nGerard bowed.\n\n\"Know then that my great-great-grandfather held his head high and being\non the point of death, revolted against lying under the aisle with his\nforbears for mean folk to pass over. So, as the tradition goes, he swore\nhis son (my great-grandfather), to bury him erect in one of the pillars\nof the church\" (here they entered the porch). \"'For,' quoth he, 'NO BASE\nMAN SHALL PASS OVER MY STOMACH.' Peste!\" and even while speaking, his\nlordship parried adroitly with his stick a skull that came hopping at\nhim, bowled by a boy in the middle of the aisle, who took to his heels\nyelling with fear the moment he saw what he had done. His lordship\nhurled the skull furiously after him as he ran, at which the cure gave a\nshout of dismay and put forth his arm to hinder him, but was too late.\n\nThe cure groaned aloud. And as if this had evoked spirits of mischief,\nup started a whole pack of children from some ambuscade, and unseen, but\nheard loud enough, clattered out of the church like a covey rising in a\nthick wood.\n\n\"Oh! these pernicious brats,\" cried the cure. \"The workmen cannot go to\ntheir nonemete but the church is rife with them. Pray Heaven they have\nnot found his late lordship; nay, I mind, I hid his lordship under a\nworkmen's jerkin, and--saints defend us! the jerkin has been moved.\"\n\nThe poor cure's worst misgivings were realized: the rising generation\nof the plebians had played the mischief with the haughty old noble. \"The\nlittle ones had jockeyed for the bones oh,\" and pocketed such of them as\nseemed adapted for certain primitive games then in vogue amongst them.\n\n\"I'll excommunicate them,\" roared the curate, \"and all their race.\"\n\n\"Never heed,\" said the scapegrace lord: and stroked his hawk; \"there is\nenough of him to swear by. Put him back! put him back!\"\n\n\"Surely, my lord, 'tis your will his bones be laid in hallowed earth,\nand masses said for his poor prideful soul?\"\n\nThe noble stroked his hawk.\n\n\"Are ye there, Master Cure?\" said he. \"Nay, the business is too old:\nhe is out of purgatory by this time, up or down. I shall not draw\nmy purse-strings for him. Every dog his day. Adieu, Messires, adieu,\nancestor;\" and he sauntered off whistling to his hawk and caressing it.\n\nHis reverence looked ruefully after him.\n\n\"Cretensis incidit in Cretensem,\" said he sorrowfully. \"I thought I\nhad him safe for a dozen masses. Yet I blame him not, but that young\nne'er-do-weel which did trundle his ancestor's skull at us: for who\ncould venerate his great-great-grandsire and play football with his\nhead? Well it behoves us to be better Christians than he is.\" So they\ngathered the bones reverently, and the cure locked them up, and forbade\nthe workmen, who now entered the church, to close up the pillar, till he\nshould recover by threats of the Church's wrath every atom of my lord.\nAnd he showed Gerard a famous shrine in the church. Before it were the\nusual gifts of tapers, etc. There was also a wax image of a falcon, most\ncuriously moulded and coloured to the life, eyes and all. Gerard's eye\nfell at once on this, and he expressed the liveliest admiration. The\ncure assented. Then Gerard asked, \"Could the saint have loved hawking?\"\n\nThe cure laughed at his simplicity. \"Nay, 'tis but a statuary hawk. When\nthey have a bird of gentle breed they cannot train, they make his image,\nand send it to this shrine with a present, and pray the saint to work\nupon the stubborn mind of the original, and make it ductile as wax: that\nis the notion, and methinks a reasonable one, too.\"\n\nGerard assented. \"But alack, reverend sir, were I a saint, methinks I\nshould side with the innocent dove, rather than with the cruel hawk that\nrends her.\"\n\n\"By St. Denys you are right,\" said the cure. \"But, que voulez-vous?\nthe saints are debonair, and have been flesh themselves, and know man's\nfrailty and absurdity. 'Tis the Bishop of Avignon sent this one.\"\n\n\"What! do bishops hawk in this country?\"\n\n\"One and all. Every noble person hawks, and lives with hawk on wrist.\nWhy, my lord abbot hard by, and his lordship that has just parted from\nus, had a two years' feud as to where they should put their hawks down\non that very altar there. Each claimed the right hand of the altar for\nhis bird.\"\n\n\"What desecration!\"\n\n\"Nay! nay! thou knowest we make them doff both glove and hawk to take\nthe blessed eucharist. Their jewelled gloves will they give to a servant\nor simple Christian to hold: but their beloved hawks they will put down\non no place less than the altar.\"\n\nGerard inquired how the battle of the hawks ended.\n\n\"Why, the abbot he yielded, as the Church yields to laymen. He searched\nancient books, and found that the left hand was the more honourable,\nbeing in truth the right hand, since the altar is east, but looks\nwestward. So he gave my lord the soi-disant right hand, and contented\nhimself with the real right hand, and even so may the Church still\noutwit the lay nobles and their arrogance, saving your presence.\"\n\n\"Nay, sir, I honour the Church. I am convent bred, and owe all I have\nand am to Holy Church.\"\n\n\"Ah, that accounts for my sudden liking to thee. Art a gracious youth.\nCome and see me whenever thou wilt.\"\n\nGerard took this as a hint that he might go now. It jumped with his own\nwish, for he was curious to hear what Denys had seen and done all this\ntime. He made his reverence and walked out of the church; but was\nno sooner clear of it than he set off to run with all his might: and\ntearing round a corner, ran into a large stomach, whose owner clutched\nhim, to keep himself steady under the shock; but did not release his\nhold on regaining his equilibrium.\n\n\"Let go, man,\" said Gerard.\n\n\"Not so. You are my prisoner.\"\n\n\"Prisoner?\"\n\n\"Ay.\"\n\n\"What for, in Heaven's name?\"\n\n\"What for? Why, sorcery.\"\n\n\"SORCERY?\"\n\n\"Sorcery.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\nThe culprits were condemned to stand pinioned in the marketplace for two\nhours, that should any persons recognize them or any of them as guilty\nof other crimes, they might depose to that effect at the trial.\n\nThey stood, however, the whole period, and no one advanced anything\nfresh against them. This was the less remarkable that they were night\nbirds, vampires who preyed in the dark on weary travellers, mostly\nstrangers.\n\nBut just as they were being taken down, a fearful scream was heard in\nthe crowd, and a woman pointed at one of them, with eyes almost starting\nfrom their sockets: but ere she could speak she fainted away.\n\nThen men and women crowded round her, partly to aid her, partly from\ncuriosity. When she began to recover they fell to conjectures.\n\n\"'Twas at him she pointed.\"\n\n\"Nay, 'twas at this one.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" said another, \"'twas at yon hangdog with the hair hung round\nhis neck.\"\n\nAll further conjectures were cut short. The poor creature no sooner\nrecovered her senses than she flew at the landlord like a lioness.\n\"My child! Man! man! Give me back my child.\" And she seized the glossy\ngolden hair that the officers had hung round his neck, and tore it\nfrom his neck, and covered it with kisses; then, her poor confused mind\nclearing, she saw even by this token that her lost girl was dead, and\nsank suddenly down shrieking and sobbing so over the poor hair, that the\ncrowd rushed on the assassin with one savage growl. His life had ended\nthen and speedily, for in those days all carried death at their girdles.\nBut Denys drew his sword directly, and shouting \"A moi, camarades!\" kept\nthe mob at bay. \"Who lays a finger on him dies.\" Other archers backed\nhim, and with some difficulty they kept him uninjured, while Denys\nappealed to those who shouted for his blood.\n\n\"What sort of vengeance is this? would you be so mad as rob the wheel,\nand give the vermin an easy death?\"\n\nThe mob was kept passive by the archers' steel rather than by Denys's\nwords, and growled at intervals with flashing eyes. The municipal\nofficers, seeing this, collected round, and with the archers made a\nguard, and prudently carried the accused back to gaol.\n\nThe mob hooted them and the prisoners indiscriminately. Denys saw the\nlatter safely lodged, then made for \"The White Hart,\" where he expected\nto find Gerard.\n\nOn the way he saw two girls working at a first-floor window. He saluted\nthem. They smiled. He entered into conversation. Their manners were\neasy, their complexion high.\n\nHe invited them to a repast at \"The White Hart.\" They objected. He\nacquiesced in their refusal. They consented. And in this charming\nsociety he forgot all about poor Gerard, who meantime was carried off to\ngaol; but on the way suddenly stopped, having now somewhat recovered\nhis presence of mind, and demanded to know by whose authority he was\narrested.\n\n\"By the vice-baillie's,\" said the constable.\n\n\"The vice-baillie? Alas! what have I, a stranger, done to offend a\nvice-baillie? For this charge of sorcery must be a blind. No sorcerer am\nI; but a poor true lad far from his home.\"\n\nThis vague shift disgusted the officer. \"Show him the capias, Jacques,\"\nsaid he.\n\nJacques held out the writ in both hands about a yard and a half from\nGerard's eye; and at the same moment the large constable suddenly pinned\nhim; both officers were on tenterhooks lest the prisoner should grab the\ndocument, to which they attached a superstitious importance.\n\nBut the poor prisoner had no such thought. Query whether he would have\ntouched it with the tongs. He just craned out his neck and read it, and\nto his infinite surprise found the vice-bailiff who had signed the writ\nwas the friendly alderman. He took courage and assured his captor there\nwas some error. But finding he made no impression, demanded to be taken\nbefore the alderman.\n\n\"What say you to that, Jacques?\"\n\n\"Impossible. We have no orders to take him before his worship. Read the\nwrit!\"\n\n\"Nay, but good kind fellows, what harm can it be? I will give you each\nan ecu.\"\n\n\"Jacques, what say you to that?\"\n\n\"Humph! I say we have no orders not to take him to his worship. Read the\nwrit!\"\n\n\"Then say we take him to prison round by his worship.\"\n\nIt was agreed. They got the money; and bade Gerard observe they were\ndoing him a favour. He saw they wanted a little gratitude as well as\nmuch silver. He tried to satisfy this cupidity, but it stuck in his\nthroat. Feigning was not his forte.\n\nHe entered the alderman's presence with his heart in his mouth, and\nbegged with faltering voice to know what he had done to offend since he\nleft that very room with Manon and Denys.\n\n\"Nought that I know of,\" said the alderman.\n\nOn the writ being shown him, he told Gerard he had signed it at\ndaybreak. \"I get old, and my memory faileth me: a discussing of the girl\nI quite forgot your own offence: but I remember now. All is well. You\nare he I committed for sorcery. Stay! ere you go to gaol, you shall hear\nwhat your accuser says: run and fetch him, you.\"\n\nThe man could not find the accuser all at once. So the alderman, getting\nimpatient, told Gerard the main charge was that he had set a dead body a\nburning with diabolical fire, that flamed, but did not consume. \"And if\n'tis true, young man, I'm sorry for thee, for thou wilt assuredly burn\nwith fire of good pine logs in the market-place of Neufchasteau.\"\n\n\"Oh, sir, for pity's sake let me have speech with his reverence the\ncure.\"\n\nThe alderman advised Gerard against it. \"The Church was harder upon\nsorcerers than was the corporation.\"\n\n\"But, sir, I am innocent,\" said Gerard, between snarling and whining.\n\n\"Oh, if you think you are innocent--officer, go with him to the cure;\nbut see he 'scape you not. Innocent, quotha?\"\n\nThey found the cure in his doublet repairing a wheelbarrow. Gerard\ntold him all, and appealed piteously to him. \"Just for using a little\nphosphorus in self-defence against cut-throats they are going to hang.\"\n\nIt was lucky for our magician that he had already told his tale in full\nto the cure, for thus that shrewd personage had hold of the stick at the\nright end. The corporation held it by the ferule. His reverence looked\nexceedingly grave and said, \"I must question you privately on this\nuntoward business.\" He took him into a private room and bade the officer\nstand outside and guard the door, and be ready to come if called. The\nbig constable stood outside the door, quaking, and expecting to see the\nroom fly away and leave a stink of brimstone. Instantly they were alone\nthe cure unlocked his countenance and was himself again.\n\n\"Show me the trick on't,\" said he, all curiosity.\n\n\"I cannot, sir, unless the room be darkened.\"\n\nThe cure speedily closed out the light with a wooden shutter. \"Now,\nthen.\"\n\n\"But on what shall I put it?\" said Gerard. \"Here is no dead face. 'Twas\nthat made it look so dire.\" The cure groped about the room. \"Good; here\nis an image: 'tis my patron saint.\"\n\n\"Heaven forbid! That were profanation.\"\n\n\"Pshaw! 'twill rub off, will't not?\"\n\n\"Ay, but it goes against me to take such liberty with a saint,\" objected\nthe sorcerer.\n\n\"Fiddlestick!\" said the divine.\n\n\"To be sure by putting it on his holiness will show your reverence it is\nno Satanic art.\"\n\n\"Mayhap 'twas for that I did propose it.\" said the cure subtly.\n\nThus encouraged, Gerard fired the eyes and nostrils of the image and\nmade the cure jump. Then lighted up the hair in patches; and set the\nwhole face shining like a glow-worm's.\n\n\"By'r Lady,\" shouted the cure, \"'tis strange, and small my wonder that\nthey took you for a magician, seeing a dead face thus fired. Now come\nthy ways with me!\"\n\nHe put on his grey gown and great hat, and in a few minutes they found\nthemselves in presence of the alderman. By his side, poisoning his mind,\nstood the accuser, a singular figure in red hose and red shoes, a black\ngown with blue bands, and a cocked hat.\n\nAfter saluting the alderman, the cure turned to this personage and said\ngood-humouredly, \"So, Mangis, at thy work again, babbling away honest\nmen's lives! Come, your worship, this is the old tale! two of a trade\ncan ne'er agree. Here is Mangis, who professes sorcery, and would sell\nhimself to Satan to-night, but that Satan is not so weak as buy what\nhe can have gratis, this Mangis, who would be a sorcerer, but is only\na quacksalver, accuses of magic a true lad, who did but use in\nself-defence a secret of chemistry well-known to me and all churchmen.\"\n\n\"But he is no churchman, to dabble in such mysteries,\" objected the\nalderman.\n\n\"He is more churchman than layman, being convent bred, and in the lesser\norders,\" said the ready cure. \"Therefore, sorcerer, withdraw thy plaint\nwithout more words!\"\n\n\"That I will not, your reverence,\" replied Mangis stoutly. \"A sorcerer I\nam, but a white one, not a black one. I make no pact with Satan, but on\nthe contrary still battle him with lawful and necessary arts, I ne'er\nprofane the sacraments, as do the black sorcerers, nor turn myself into\na cat and go sucking infants' blood, nor e'en their breath, nor set dead\nmen o' fire. I but tell the peasants when their cattle and their hens\nare possessed, and at what time of the moon to plant rye, and what days\nin each month are lucky for wooing of women and selling of bullocks\nand so forth: above all, it is my art and my trade to detect the black\nmagicians, as I did that whole tribe of them who were burnt at Dol but\nlast year.\"\n\n\"Ay, Mangis. And what is the upshot of that famous fire thy tongue did\nkindle?\"\n\n\"Why, their ashes were cast to the wind.\"\n\n\"Ay. But the true end of thy comedy is this. The parliament of Dijon\nhath since sifted the matter, and found they were no sorcerers, but good\nand peaceful citizens; and but last week did order masses to be said for\ntheir souls, and expiatory farces and mysteries to be played for them\nin seven towns of Burgundy; all which will not of those cinders make men\nand women again. Now 'tis our custom in this land, when we have slain\nthe innocent by hearkening false knaves like thee, not to blame our\ncredulous ears, but the false tongue that gulled them. Therefore bethink\nthee that, at a word from me to my lord bishop, thou wilt smell burning\npine nearer than e'er knave smelt it and lived, and wilt travel on a\nsmoky cloud to him whose heart thou bearest (for the word devil in the\nLatin it meaneth 'false accuser'), and whose livery thou wearest.\"\n\nAnd the cure pointed at Mangis with his staff.\n\n\"That is true i'fegs,\" said the alderman, \"for red and black be the foul\nfiendys colours.\"\n\nBy this time the white sorcerer's cheek was as colourless as his dress\nwas fiery. Indeed the contrast amounted to pictorial. He stammered out,\n\"I respect Holy Church and her will; he shall fire the churchyard, and\nall in it, for me: I do withdraw the plaint.\"\n\n\"Then withdraw thyself,\" said the vice-bailiff.\n\nThe moment he was gone the cure took the conversational tone, and told\nthe alderman courteously that the accused had received the chemical\nsubstance from Holy Church, and had restored it her, by giving it all to\nhim.\n\n\"Then 'tis in good hands,\" was the reply; \"young man, you are free. Let\nme have your reverence's prayers.\"\n\n\"Doubt it not! Humph! Vice-baillie, the town owes me four silver franks,\nthis three months and more.\"\n\n\"They shall be paid, cure, ay, ere the week be out.\"\n\nOn this good understanding Church and State parted. As soon as he was in\nthe street Gerard caught the priest's hand, and kissed it.\n\n\"Oh, sir! Oh, your reverence. You have saved me from the fiery stake.\nWhat can I say, what do? what?\"\n\n\"Nought, foolish lad. Bounty rewards itself. Natheless--Humph?--I wish\nI had done't without leasing. It ill becomes my function to utter\nfalsehoods.\"\n\n\"Falsehood, sir?\" Gerard was mystified.\n\n\"Didst not hear me say thou hadst given me that same phosphorus? 'Twill\ncost me a fortnight's penance, that light word.\" The cure sighed, and\nhis eye twinkled cunningly.\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" cried Gerard eagerly. \"Now Heaven forbid! That was no\nfalsehood, father: well you knew the phosphorus was yours, is yours.\"\nAnd he thrust the bottle into the cure's hand. \"But alas, 'tis too poor\na gift: will you not take from my purse somewhat for Holy Church?\" and\nnow he held out his purse with glistening eyes.\n\n\"Nay,\" said the other brusquely, and put his hands quickly behind him;\n\"not a doit. Fie! fie! art pauper et exul. Come thou rather each day at\nnoon and take thy diet with me; for my heart warms to thee;\" and he went\noff very abruptly with his hands behind him.\n\nThey itched.\n\nBut they itched in vain.\n\nWhere there's a heart there's a Rubicon.\n\nGerard went hastily to the inn to relieve Denys of the anxiety so long\nand mysterious an absence must have caused him. He found him seated\nat his ease, playing dice with two young ladies whose manners were\nunreserved, and complexion high.\n\nGerard was hurt. \"N'oubliez point la Jeanneton!\" said he, colouring up.\n\n\"What of her?\" said Denys, gaily rattling the dice.\n\n\"She said, 'Le peu que sont les femmes.'\"\n\n\"Oh, did she? And what say you to that, mesdemoiselles?\"\n\n\"We say that none run women down, but such as are too old, or too\nill-favoured, or too witless to please them.\"\n\n\"Witless, quotha? Wise men have not folly enough to please them, nor\nmadness enough to desire to please them,\" said Gerard loftily; \"but 'tis\nto my comrade I speak, not to you, you brazen toads, that make so free\nwith a man at first sight.\"\n\n\"Preach away, comrade. Fling a byword or two at our heads. Know, girls,\nthat he is a very Solomon for bywords. Methinks he was brought up by\nhand on 'em.\"\n\n\"Be thy friendship a byword!\" retorted Gerard. \"The friendship that\nmelts to nought at sight of a farthingale.\"\n\n\"Malheureux!\" cried Denys, \"I speak but pellets, and thou answerest\ndaggers.\"\n\n\"Would I could,\" was the reply. \"Adieu.\"\n\n\"What a little savage!\" said one of the girls.\n\nGerard opened the door and put in his head. \"I have thought of a\nbyword,\" said he spitefully--\n\n     \"Qui hante femmes et dez\n     Il mourra en pauvretez.\n\n\"There.\" And having delivered this thunderbolt of antique wisdom, he\nslammed the door viciously ere any of them could retort.\n\nAnd now, being somewhat exhausted by his anxieties, he went to the bar\nfor a morsel of bread and a cup of wine. The landlord would sell nothing\nless than a pint bottle. Well then he would have a bottle; but when he\ncame to compare the contents of the bottle with its size, great was the\ndiscrepancy: on this he examined the bottle keenly, and found that\nthe glass was thin where the bottle tapered, but towards the bottom\nunnaturally thick. He pointed this out at once.\n\nThe landlord answered superciliously that he did not make bottles: and\nwas nowise accountable for their shape.\n\n\"That we will see presently,\" said Gerard. \"I will take this thy pint to\nthe vice-bailiff.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, for Heaven's sake,\" cried the landlord, changing his tone at\nonce. \"I love to content my customers. If by chance this pint be short,\nwe will charge it and its fellow three sous insteads of two sous each.\"\n\n\"So be it. But much I admire that you, the host of so fair an inn,\nshould practise thus. The wine, too, smacketh strongly of spring water.\"\n\n\"Young sir,\" said the landlord, \"we cut no travellers' throats at this\ninn, as they do at most. However, you know all about that, 'The White\nHart' is no lion, nor bear. Whatever masterful robbery is done here, is\ndone upon the poor host. How then could he live at all if he dealt not a\nlittle crooked with the few who pay?\"\n\nGerard objected to this system root and branch. Honest trade was small\nprofits, quick returns; and neither to cheat nor be cheated.\n\nThe landlord sighed at this picture. \"So might one keep an inn in\nheaven, but not in Burgundy. When foot soldiers going to the wars are\nquartered on me, how can I but lose by their custom? Two sous per day is\ntheir pay, and they eat two sous' worth, and drink into the bargain. The\npardoners are my good friends, but palmers and pilgrims, what think you\nI gain by them? marry, a loss. Minstrels and jongleurs draw custom and\nso claim to pay no score, except for liquor. By the secular monks I\nneither gain nor lose, but the black and grey friars have made vow\nof poverty, but not of famine; eat like wolves and give the poor host\nnought but their prayers; and mayhap not them: how can he tell? In my\nfather's day we had the weddings; but now the great gentry let their\nhouses and their plates, their mugs and their spoons to any honest\ncouple that want to wed, and thither the very mechanics go with their\nbrides and bridal train. They come not to us: indeed we could not find\nseats and vessels for such a crowd as eat and drink and dance the week\nout at the homeliest wedding now. In my father's day the great gentry\nsold wine by the barrel only; but now they have leave to cry it, and\nsell it by the galopin, in the very market-place. How can we vie with\nthem? They grow it. We buy it of the grower. The coroner's quests we\nhave still, and these would bring goodly profit, but the meat is aye\ngone ere the mouths be full.\"\n\n\"You should make better provision,\" suggested his hearer.\n\n\"The law will not let us. We are forbidden to go into the market for\nthe first hour. So, when we arrive, the burghers have bought all but the\nrefuse. Besides, the law forbids us to buy more than three bushels\nof meal at a time: yet market day comes but once a week. As for the\nbutchers, they will not kill for us unless we bribe them.\"\n\n\"Courage!\" said Gerard kindly, \"the shoe pinches every trader\nsomewhere.\"\n\n\"Ay: but not as it pinches us. Our shoe is trode all o' one side as well\nas pinches us lame. A savoir, if we pay not the merchants we buy meal,\nmeat, and wine of, they can cast us into prison and keep us there till\nwe pay or die. But we cannot cast into prison those who buy those very\nvictuals of us. A traveller's horse we may keep for his debt; but where,\nin Heaven's name? In our own stable, eating his head off at our cost.\nNay, we may keep the traveller himself; but where? In gaol? Nay, in\nour own good house, and there must we lodge and feed him gratis. And so\nfling good silver after bad? Merci; no: let him go with a wanion. Our\nhonestest customers are the thieves. Would to Heaven there were more of\nthem. They look not too close into the shape of the canakin, nor into\nthe host's reckoning: with them and with their purses 'tis lightly come,\nand lightly go. Also they spend freely, not knowing but each carouse may\nbe their last. But the thief-takers, instead of profiting by this\nfair example, are for ever robbing the poor host. When noble or honest\ntravellers descend at our door, come the Provost's men pretending to\nsuspect them, and demanding to search them and their papers. To save\nwhich offence the host must bleed wine and meat. Then come the excise to\nexamine all your weights and measures. You must stop their mouths with\nmeat and wine. Town excise. Royal excise. Parliament excise. A swarm\nof them, and all with a wolf in their stomachs and a sponge in their\ngullets. Monks, friars, pilgrims, palmers, soldiers, excisemen,\nprovost-marshals and men, and mere bad debtors, how can 'The White Hart'\nbutt against all these? Cutting no throats in self-defence as do your\n'Swans' and 'Roses' and 'Boar's Heads' and 'Red Lions' and 'Eagles,'\nyour 'Moons,' 'Stars,' and 'Moors,' how can 'The White Hart' give a pint\nof wine for a pint? And everything risen so. Why, lad, not a pound of\nbread I sell but cost me three good copper deniers, twelve to the sou;\nand each pint of wine, bought by the tun, costs me four deniers; every\nsack of charcoal two sous, and gone in a day. A pair of partridges five\nsous. What think you of that? Heard one ever the like? five sous for two\nlittle beasts all bone and feather? A pair of pigeons, thirty deniers.\n'Tis ruination!!! For we may not raise our pricen with the market. Oh,\nno, I tell thee the shoe is trode all o' one side as well as pinches the\nwater into our eyn. We may charge nought for mustard, pepper, salt,\nor firewood. Think you we get them for nought? Candle it is a sou the\npound. Salt five sous the stone, pepper four sous the pound, mustard\ntwenty deniers the pint; and raw meat, dwindleth it on the spit with no\ncost to me but loss of weight? Why, what think you I pay my cook? But\nyou shall never guess. A HUNDRED SOUS A YEAR AS I AM A LIVING SINNER.\n\n\"And my waiter thirty sous, besides his perquisites. He is a hantle\nricher than I am. And then to be insulted as well as pillaged. Last\nSunday I went to church. It is a place I trouble not often. Didn't the\ncure lash the hotel-keepers? I grant you he hit all the trades, except\nthe one that is a byword for looseness, and pride, and sloth, to wit,\nthe clergy. But, mind you, he stripeit the other lay estates with a\nfeather, but us hotel-keepers with a neat's pizzle: godless for this,\ngodless for that, and most godless of all for opening our doors during\nmass. Why, the law forces us to open at all hours to travellers from\nanother town, stopping, halting, or passing: those be the words. They\ncan fine us before the bailiff if we refuse them, mass or no mass;\nand say a townsman should creep in with the true travellers, are we to\nblame? They all vow they are tired wayfarers; and can I ken every face\nin a great town like this? So if we respect the law our poor souls are\nto suffer, and if we respect it not, our poor lank purses must bleed at\ntwo holes, fine and loss of custom.\"\n\nA man speaking of himself in general, is \"a babbling brook;\" of his\nwrongs, \"a shining river.\"\n\n\"Labitur et labetur in omne volubilis aevum.\"\n\nSo luckily for my readers, though not for all concerned, this injured\norator was arrested in mid career. Another man burst in upon his wrongs\nwith all the advantage of a recent wrong; a wrong red hot. It was Denys\ncursing and swearing and crying that he was robbed.\n\n\"Did those hussies pass this way? who are they? where do they bide? They\nhave ta'en my purse and fifteen golden pieces: raise the hue and cry!\nah! traitresses! vipers! These inns are all guet-apens.\"\n\n\"There now,\" cried the landlord to Gerard.\n\nGerard implored him to be calm, and say how it had befallen.\n\n\"First one went out on some pretence: then after a while the other went\nto fetch her back, and neither returning, I clapped hand to purse and\nfound it empty: the ungrateful creatures, I was letting them win it in a\ngallop: but loaded dice were not quick enough; they must claw it all in\na lump.\"\n\nGerard was for going at once to the alderman and setting the officers to\nfind them.\n\n\"Not I,\" said Denys. \"I hate the law. No: as it came so let it go.\"\n\nGerard would not give it up so.\n\nAt a hint from the landlord he forced Denys along with him to the\nprovost-marshal. That dignitary shook his head. \"We have no clue to\noccasional thieves, that work honestly at their needles, till some gull\ncomes and tempts them with an easy booty, and then they pluck him.\n\n\"Come away,\" cried Denys furiously. \"I knew what use a bourgeois would\nbe to me at a pinch:\" and he marched off in a rage.\n\n\"They are clear of the town ere this,\" said Gerard.\n\n\"Speak no more on't if you prize my friendship. I have five pieces with\nthe bailiff, and ten I left with Manon, luckily; or these traitresses\nhad feathered their nest with my last plume. What dost gape for so? Nay,\nI do ill to vent my choler on thee: I'll tell thee all. Art wiser than\nI. What saidst thou at the door? No matter. Well, then, I did offer\nmarriage to that Manon.\"\n\nGerard was dumfounded.\n\n\"What? You offered her what?\"\n\n\"Marriage. Is that such a mighty strange thing to offer a wench?\"\n\n\"'Tis a strange thing to offer to a strange girl in passing.\"\n\n\"Nay, I am not such a sot as you opine. I saw the corn in all that\nchaff. I knew I could not get her by fair means, so I was fain to try\nfoul. 'Mademoiselle,' said I, 'marriage is not one of my habits, but\nstruck by your qualities I make an exception; deign to bestow this hand\non me.'\"\n\n\"And she bestowed it on thine ear.'\"\n\n\"Not so. On the contrary she--Art a disrespectful young monkey. Know\nthat here, not being Holland or any other barbarous state, courtesy\nbegets courtesy. Says she, a colouring like a rose, 'Soldier, you are\ntoo late. He is not a patch on you for looks; but then--he has loved me\na long time.'\n\n\"'He? who?'\n\n\"'T'other.'\n\n\"'What other?'\n\n\"Why, he that was not too late.' Oh, that is the way they all speak, the\nloves; the she-wolves. Their little minds go in leaps. Think you they\nmarshal their words in order of battle? Their tongues are in too great\na hurry. Says she, 'I love him not; not to say love him; but he does me,\nand dearly; and for that reason I'd sooner die than cause him grief, I\nwould.'\"\n\n\"Now I believe she did love him.\"\n\n\"Who doubts that? Why she said so, round about, as they always say these\nthings, and with 'nay' for 'ay.'\n\n\"Well one thing led to another, and at last, as she could not give me\nher hand, she gave me a piece of advice, and that was to leave part of\nmy money with the young mistress. Then, when bad company had cleaned me\nout, I should have some to travel back with, said she. I said I would\nbetter her advice, and leave it with her. Her face got red. Says she,\n'Think what you do. Chambermaids have an ill name for honesty.' 'Oh, the\ndevil is not so black as he is painted,' said I. 'I'll risk it;' and I\nleft fifteen gold pieces with her.\"\n\nGerard sighed. \"I wish you may ever see them again. It is wondrous in\nwhat esteem you do hold this sex, to trust so to the first comer. For my\npart I know little about them; I never saw but one I could love as well\nas I love thee. But the ancients must surely know; and they held women\ncheap. 'Levius quid femina,' said they, which is but la Jeanneton's\ntune in Latin, 'Le peu que sont les femmes.' Also do but see how the\ngreybeards of our own day speak of them, being no longer blinded by\ndesire: this alderman, to wit.\"\n\n\"Oh, novice of novices,\" cried Denys, \"not to have seen why that old\nfool rails so on the poor things! One day, out of the millions of women\nhe blackens, one did prefer some other man to him: for which solitary\npiece of bad taste, and ten to one 'twas good taste, he doth bespatter\ncreation's fairer half, thereby proving what? le peu que sont les\nhommes.\"\n\n\"I see women have a shrewd champion in thee,\" said Gerard, with a smile.\nBut the next moment inquired gravely why he had not told him all this\nbefore.\n\nDenys grinned. \"Had the girl said 'Ay,' why then I had told thee\nstraight. But 'tis a rule with us soldiers never to publish our defeats:\n'tis much if after each check we claim not a victory.\"\n\n\"Now that is true,\" said Gerard. \"Young as I am, I have seen this; that\nafter every great battle the generals on both sides go to the nearest\nchurch, and sing each a Te Deum for the victory; methinks a Te Martem,\nor Te Bellonam, or Te Mercurium, Mercury being the god of lies, were\nmore fitting.\"\n\n\"Pas si bete,\" said Denys approvingly. \"Hast a good eye: canst see a\nsteeple by daylight. So now tell me how thou hast fared in this town all\nday.\"\n\n\"Come,\" said Gerard, \"'tis well thou hast asked me: for else I had never\ntold thee.\" He then related in full how he had been arrested, and by\nwhat a providential circumstance he had escaped long imprisonment or\nspeedy conflagration.\n\nHis narrative produced an effect he little expected or desired.\n\n\"I am a traitor,\" cried Denys. \"I left thee in a strange place to fight\nthine own battles, while I shook the dice with those jades. Now take\nthou this sword and pass it through my body forthwith.\"\n\n\"What for in Heaven's name?\" inquired Gerard.\n\n\"For an example,\" roared Denys. \"For a warning to all false loons that\nprofess friendship, and disgrace it.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" said Gerard. \"Yes. Not a bad notion. Where will you\nhave it?\"\n\n\"Here, through my heart; that is, where other men have a heart, but I\nnone, or a Satanic false one.\"\n\nGerard made a motion to run him through, and flung his arms round his\nneck instead. \"I know no way to thy heart but this, thou great silly\nthing.\"\n\nDenys uttered an exclamation, then hugged him warmly--and, quite\novercome by this sudden turn of youthful affection and native grace,\ngulped out in a broken voice, \"Railest on women--and art--like\nthem--with thy pretty ways. Thy mother's milk is in thee still. Satan\nwould love thee, or--le bon Dieu would kick him out of hell for shaming\nit. Give me thy hand! Give me thy hand! May\" (a tremendous oath) \"if I\nlet thee out of my sight till Italy.\"\n\nAnd so the staunch friends were more than reconciled after their short\ntiff.\n\nThe next day the thieves were tried. The pieces de conviction were\nreduced in number, to the great chagrin of the little clerk, by the\ninterment of the bones. But there was still a pretty show. A thief's\nhand struck off flagrante delicto; a murdered woman's hair; the Abbot's\naxe, and other tools of crime. The skulls, etc., were sworn to by the\nconstables who had found them. Evidence was lax in that age and place.\nThey all confessed but the landlord. And Manon was called to bring the\ncrime home to him. Her evidence was conclusive. He made a vain attempt\nto shake her credibility by drawing from her that her own sweetheart had\nbeen one of the gang, and that she had held her tongue so long as he\nwas alive. The public prosecutor came to the aid of his witness,\nand elicited that a knife had been held to her throat, and her own\nsweetheart sworn with solemn oaths to kill her should she betray them,\nand that this terrible threat, and not the mere fear of death, had glued\nher lips.\n\nThe other thieves were condemned to be hanged, and the landlord to be\nbroken on the wheel. He uttered a piercing cry when his sentence was\npronounced.\n\nAs for poor Manon, she became the subject of universal criticism. Nor\ndid opinion any longer run dead in her favour; it divided into two broad\ncurrents. And strange to relate, the majority of her own sex took her\npart, and the males were but equally divided; which hardly happens once\nin a hundred years. Perhaps some lady will explain the phenomenon. As\nfor me, I am a little shy of explaining things I don't understand. It\nhas become so common. Meantime, had she been a lover of notoriety, she\nwould have been happy, for the town talked of nothing but her. The poor\ngirl, however, had but one wish to escape the crowd that followed her,\nand hide her head somewhere where she could cry over her \"pendard,\"\nwhom all these proceedings brought vividly back to her affectionate\nremembrance. Before he was hanged he had threatened her life; but she\nwas not one of your fastidious girls, who love their male divinities any\nthe less for beating them, kicking them, or killing them, but rather\nthe better, provided these attentions are interspersed with occasional\ncaresses; so it would have been odd indeed had she taken offence at a\nmere threat of that sort. He had never threatened her with a rival. She\nsobbed single-mindedly.\n\nMeantime the inn was filled with thirsters for a sight of her, who\nfeasted and drank, to pass away the time till she should deign to\nappear. When she had been sobbing some time, there was a tap at her\ndoor, and the landlord entered with a proposal. \"Nay, weep not, good\nlass, your fortune it is made an you like. Say the word, and you are\nchambermaid of 'The White Hart.'\"\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" said Manon with a fresh burst of grief. \"Never more will I\nbe a servant in an inn. I'll go to my mother.\"\n\nThe landlord consoled and coaxed her: and she became calmer, but none\nthe less determined against his proposal.\n\nThe landlord left her. But ere long he returned and made her another\nproposal. Would she be his wife, and landlady of \"The White Hart\"?\n\n\"You do ill to mock me,\" said she sorrowfully.\n\n\"Nay, sweetheart. I mock thee not. I am too old for sorry jests. Say you\nthe word, and you are my partner for better for worse.\"\n\nShe looked at him, and saw he was in earnest: on this she suddenly\nrained hard to the memory of \"le pendard\": the tears came in a torrent,\nbeing the last; and she gave her hand to the landlord of \"The White\nHart,\" and broke a gold crown with him in sign of plighted troth.\n\n\"We will keep it dark till the house is quiet,\" said the landlord.\n\n\"Ay,\" said she; \"but meantime prithee give me linen to hem, or work to\ndo; for the time hangs on me like lead.\"\n\nHer betrothed's eye brightened at this housewifely request, and he\nbrought her up two dozen flagons of various sizes to clean and polish.\n\nShe gathered complacency as she reflected that by a strange turn of\nfortune all this bright pewter was to be hers.\n\nMeantime the landlord went downstairs, and falling in with our friends\ndrew them aside into the bar.\n\nHe then addressed Denys with considerable solemnity. \"We are old\nacquaintances, and you want not for sagacity: now advise me in a strait.\nMy custom is somewhat declining: this girl Manon is the talk of the\ntown; see how full the inn is to-night. She doth refuse to be my\nchambermaid. I have half a mind to marry her. What think you? shall I\nsay the word?\"\n\nDenys in reply merely open his eyes wide with amazement.\n\nThe landlord turned to Gerard with a half-inquiring look,\n\n\"Nay, sir,\" said Gerard; \"I am too young to advise my seniors and\nbetters.\"\n\n\"No matter. Let us hear your thought.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, it was said of a good wife by the ancients, 'bene quae\nlatuit, bene vixit,' that is, she is the best wife that is least talked\nof: but here 'male quae patuit' were as near the mark. Therefore, an\nyou bear the lass good-will, why not club purses with Denys and me and\nconvey her safe home with a dowry? Then mayhap some rustical person in\nher own place may be brought to wife her.\"\n\n\"Why so many words?\" said Denys. \"This old fox is not the ass he affects\nto be.\"\n\n\"Oh! that is your advice, is it?\" said the landlord testily. \"Well then\nwe shall soon know who is the fool, you or me, for I have spoken to her\nas it happens; and what is more, she has said Ay, and she is polishing\nthe flagons at this moment.\"\n\n\"Oho!\" said Denys drily, \"'twas an ambuscade. Well, in that case, my\nadvice is, run for the notary, tie the noose, and let us three drink the\nbride's health, till we see six sots a-tippling.\"\n\n\"And shall. Ay, now you utter sense.\"\n\nIn ten minutes a civil marriage was effected upstairs before a notary\nand his clerk and our two friends.\n\nIn ten minutes more the white hind, dead sick of seclusion, had taken\nher place within the bar, and was serving out liquids, and bustling, and\nher colour rising a little.\n\nIn six little minutes more she soundly rated a careless servant-girl for\ncarrying a nipperkin of wine awry and spilling good liquor.\n\nDuring the evening she received across the bar eight offers of marriage,\nsome of them from respectable burghers. Now the landlord and our two\nfriends had in perfect innocence ensconced themselves behind a screen,\nto drink at their ease the new couple's health. The above comedy was\nthrown in for their entertainment by bounteous fate. They heard the\nproposals made one after another, and uninventive Manon's invariable\nanswer--\"Serviteur; you are a day after the fair.\" The landlord chuckled\nand looked good-natured superiority at both his late advisers, with\ntheir traditional notions that men shun a woman \"quae patuit,\" i.e. who\nhas become the town talk.\n\nBut Denys scarce noticed the spouse's triumph over him, he was so\noccupied with his own over Gerard. At each municipal tender of undying\naffection, he turned almost purple with the effort it cost him not\nto roar with glee; and driving his elbow into the deep-meditating\nand much-puzzled pupil of antiquity, whispered, \"Le peu que sont les\nhommes.\"\n\nThe next morning Gerard was eager to start, but Denys was under a vow to\nsee the murderers of the golden-haired girl executed.\n\nGerard respected his vow, but avoided his example.\n\nHe went to bid the cure farewell instead, and sought and received his\nblessing. About noon the travellers got clear of the town. Just outside\nthe south gate they passed the gallows; it had eight tenants: the\nskeleton of Manon's late wept, and now being fast forgotten, lover, and\nthe bodies of those who had so nearly taken our travellers' lives. A\nhand was nailed to the beam. And hard by on a huge wheel was clawed the\ndead landlord, with every bone in his body broken to pieces.\n\nGerard averted his head and hurried by. Denys lingered, and crowed over\nhis dead foes. \"Times are changed, my lads, since we two sat shaking in\nthe cold awaiting you seven to come and cut our throats.\"\n\n\"Fie, Denys! Death squares all reckonings. Prithee pass on without\nanother word, if you prize my respect a groat.\"\n\nTo this earnest remonstrance Denys yielded. He even said thoughtfully,\n\"You have been better brought up than I.\"\n\nAbout three in the afternoon they reached a little town with the people\nbuzzing in knots. The wolves, starved by the cold, had entered, and\neaten two grown-up persons overnight, in the main street: so some were\nblaming the eaten--\"None but fools or knaves are about after nightfall;\"\nothers the law for not protecting the town, and others the corporation\nfor not enforcing what laws there were.\n\n\"Bah! this is nothing to us,\" said Denys, and was for resuming their\nmarch.\n\n\"Ay, but 'tis,\" remonstrated Gerard.\n\n\"What, are we the pair they ate?\"\n\n\"No, but we may be the next pair.\"\n\n\"Ay, neighbour,\" said an ancient man, \"'tis the town's fault for not\nobeying the ducal ordinance, which bids every shopkeeper light a lamp\no'er his door at sunset, and burn it till sunrise.\"\n\nOn this Denys asked him somewhat derisively, \"What made him fancy rush\ndips would scare away empty wolves? Why, mutton fat is all their joy.\"\n\n\"'Tis not the fat, vain man, but the light. All ill things hate light;\nespecially wolves and the imps that lurk, I ween, under their fur.\nExample; Paris city stands in a wood like, and the wolves do howl around\nit all night: yet of late years wolves come but little in the streets.\nFor why, in that burgh the watchmen do thunder at each door that is\ndark, and make the weary wight rise and light. 'Tis my son tells me. He\nis a great voyager, my son Nicholas.\"\n\nIn further explanation he assured them that previously to that ordinance\nno city had been worse infested with wolves than Paris; a troop had\nboldly assaulted the town in 1420, and in 1438 they had eaten fourteen\npersons in a single month between Montmartre and the gate St. Antoine,\nand that not a winter month even, but September: and as for the\ndead, which nightly lay in the streets slain in midnight brawls, or\nassassinated, the wolves had used to devour them, and to grub up the\nfresh graves in the churchyards and tear out the bodies.\n\nHere a thoughtful citizen suggested that probably the wolves had been\nbridled of late in Paris, not by candle-lights, but owing to the English\nhaving been driven out of the kingdom of France. \"For those English be\nvery wolves themselves for fierceness and greediness. What marvel then\nthat under their rule our neighbours of France should be wolf-eaten?\"\nThis logic was too suited to the time and place not to be received\nwith acclamation. But the old man stood his ground. \"I grant ye those\nislanders are wolves; but two-legged ones, and little apt to favour\ntheir four-footed cousins. One greedy thing loveth it another? I trow\nnot. By the same token, and this too I have from my boy Nicole, Sir Wolf\ndare not show his nose in London city; though 'tis smaller than Paris,\nand thick woods hard by the north wall, and therein great store of deer,\nand wild boars as rife as flies at midsummer.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Gerard, \"you seem conversant with wild beasts, prithee\nadvise my comrade here and me: we would not waste time on the road, an\nif we may go forward to the next town with reasonable safety.'\n\n\"Young man, I trow 'twere an idle risk. It lacks but an hour of dusk,\nand you must pass nigh a wood where lurk some thousands of these\nhalf-starved vermin, rank cowards single; but in great bands bold as\nlions. Wherefore I rede you sojourn here the night; and journey on\nbetimes. By the dawn the vermin will be tired out with roaring and\nrampaging; and mayhap will have filled their lank bellies with flesh of\nmy good neighbours here, the unteachable fools.\"\n\nGerard hoped not; and asked could he recommend them to a good inn.\n\n\"Humph! there is the 'Tete d'Or.' My grandaughter keeps it. She is\na mijauree, but not so knavish as most hotel-keepers, and her house\nindifferent clean.\"\n\n\"Hey, for the 'Tete d'Or,'\" struck in Denys, decided by his ineradicable\nfoible.\n\nOn the way to it, Gerard inquired of his companion what a \"mijauree\"\nwas?\n\nDenys laughed at his ignorance. \"Not know what a mijauree is? why all\nthe world knows that. It is neither more nor less than a mijauree.\"\n\nAs they entered the \"Tete d'Or,\" they met a young lady richly dressed\nwith a velvet chaperon on her head, which was confined by law to the\nnobility. They unbonneted and louted low, and she curtsied, but fixed\nher eye on vacancy the while, which had a curious rather than a genial\neffect. However, nobility was not so unassuming in those days as it\nis now. So they were little surprised. But the next minute supper was\nserved, and lo! in came this princess and carved the goose.\n\n\"Holy St. Bavon,\" cried Gerard. \"'Twas the landlady all the while.\"\n\nA young woman, cursed with nice white teeth and lovely hands: for these\nbeauties being misallied to homely features, had turned her head. She\nwas a feeble carver, carving not for the sake of others but herself,\ni.e. to display her hands. When not carving she was eternally either\ntaking a pin out of her head or her body, or else putting a pin into her\nhead or her body. To display her teeth, she laughed indifferently at gay\nor grave and from ear to ear. And she \"sat at ease\" with her mouth ajar.\n\nNow there is an animal in creation of no great general merit; but it has\nthe eye of a hawk for affectation. It is called \"a boy.\" And Gerard was\nbut a boy still in some things; swift to see, and to loath, affectation.\nSo Denys sat casting sheep's eyes, and Gerard daggers, at one comedian.\n\nPresently, in the midst of her minauderies, she gave a loud shriek and\nbounded out of her chair like hare from form, and ran backwards out of\nthe room uttering little screams, and holding her farthingale tight down\nto her ankles with both hands. And as she scuttled out of the door a\nmouse scuttled back to the wainscot in a state of equal, and perhaps\nmore reasonable terror. The guests, who had risen in anxiety at the\nprincipal yell, now stood irresolute awhile, then sat down laughing. The\ntender Denys, to whom a woman's cowardice, being a sexual trait, seemed\nto be a lovely and pleasant thing, said he would go comfort her and\nbring her back.\n\n\"Nay! nay! nay! for pity's sake let her bide,\" cried Gerard earnestly.\n\"Oh, blessed mouse! sure some saint sent thee to our aid.\"\n\nNow at his right hand sat a sturdy middle-aged burgher, whose conduct up\nto date had been cynical. He had never budged nor even rested his knife\nat all this fracas. He now turned on Gerard and inquired haughtily\nwhether he really thought that \"grimaciere\" was afraid of a mouse.\n\n\"Ay. She screamed hearty.\"\n\n\"Where is the coquette that cannot scream to the life? These she\ntavern-keepers do still ape the nobles. Some princess or duchess hath\nlain here a night, that was honestly afeard of a mouse, having been\nbrought up to it. And this ape hath seen her, and said, 'I will start\nat a mouse, and make a coil,' She has no more right to start at a mouse\nthan to wear that fur on her bosom, and that velvet on her monkey's\nhead. I am of the town, young man, and have known the mijauree all her\nlife, and I mind when she was no more afeard of a mouse than she is of\na man.\" He added that she was fast emptying the inn with these\n\"singeries.\" \"All the world is so sick of her hands, that her very\nkinsfolk will not venture themselves anigh them.\" He concluded with\nsomething like a sigh, \"The 'Tete d'Or' was a thriving hostelry under my\nold chum her good father; but she is digging its grave tooth and nail.'\n\n\"Tooth and nail? good! a right merry conceit and a true,\" said Gerard.\nBut the right merry conceit was an inadvertence as pure as snow, and\nthe stout burgher went to his grave and never knew what he had done:\nfor just then attention was attracted by Denys returning pompously. He\ninspected the apartment minutely, and with a high official air: he also\nlooked solemnly under the table; and during the whole inquisition a\nwhite hand was placed conspicuously on the edge of the open door, and\na tremulous voice inquired behind it whether the horrid thing was quite\ngone.\n\n\"The enemy has retreated, bag and baggage,\" said Denys: and handed in\nthe trembling fair, who, sitting down, apologized to her guests for\nher foolish fears, with so much earnestness, grace, and seeming\nself-contempt, that, but for a sour grin on his neighbour's face, Gerard\nwould have been taken in as all the other strangers were. Dinner ended,\nthe young landlady begged an Augustine friar at her right hand to say\ngrace. He delivered a longish one. The moment he began, she clapped her\nwhite hands piously together, and held them up joined for mortals to\nadmire; 'tis an excellent pose for taper white fingers: and cast her\neyes upward towards heaven, and felt as thankful to it as a magpie does\nwhile cutting off with your thimble.\n\nAfter supper the two friends went to the street-door and eyed the\nmarket-place. The mistress joined them, and pointed out the town-hall,\nthe borough gaol, St. Catherine's church, etc. This was courteous, to\nsay the least. But the true cause soon revealed itself; the fair hand\nwas poked right under their eyes every time an object was indicated; and\nGerard eyed it like a basilisk, and longed for a bunch of nettles. The\nsun set, and the travellers, few in number, drew round the great roaring\nfire, and omitting to go on the spit, were frozen behind though roasted\nin front. For if the German stoves were oppressively hot, the French\nsalles manger were bitterly cold, and above all stormy. In Germany men\nsat bareheaded round the stove, and took off their upper clothes, but in\nBurgundy they kept on their hats, and put on their warmest furs to sit\nround the great open chimney places, at which the external air rushed\nfuriously from door and ill-fitting window. However, it seems their\nmediaeval backs were broad enough to bear it: for they made themselves\nnot only comfortable but merry, and broke harmless jests over each\nother in turn. For instance, Denys's new shoes, though not in direct\ncommunication, had this day exploded with twin-like sympathy and\nunanimity. \"Where do you buy your shoon, soldier?\" asked one.\n\nDenys looked askant at Gerard, and not liking the theme, shook it off.\n\"I gather 'em off the trees by the roadside,\" said he surlily.\n\n\"Then you gathered these too ripe,\" said the hostess, who was only a\nfool externally.\n\n\"Ay, rotten ripe,\" observed another, inspecting them.\n\nGerard said nothing, but pointed the circular satire by pantomime. He\nslily put out both his feet, one after another, under Denys's eye, with\ntheir German shoes, on which a hundred leagues of travel had produced no\neffect. They seemed hewn out of a rock.\n\nAt this, \"I'll twist the smooth varlet's neck that sold me mine,\"\nshouted Denys, in huge wrath, and confirmed the threat with singular\noaths peculiar to the mediaeval military. The landlady put her fingers\nin her ears, thereby exhibiting the hand in a fresh attitude. \"Tell me\nwhen he has done his orisons, somebody,\" said she mincingly. And after\nthat they fell to telling stories.\n\nGerard, when his turn came, told the adventure of Denys and Gerard at\nthe inn in Domfront, and so well, that the hearers were rapt into sweet\noblivion of the very existence of mijauree and hands. But this made her\nvery uneasy, and she had recourse to her grand coup. This misdirected\ngenius had for a twelvemonth past practised yawning, and could do it\nnow at any moment so naturally as to set all creation gaping, could all\ncreation have seen her. By this means she got in all her charms. For\nfirst she showed her teeth, then, out of good breeding, you know, closed\nher mouth with three taper fingers. So the moment Gerard's story got too\ninteresting and absorbing, she turned to and made yawns, and \"croix sur\nla bouche.\"\n\nThis was all very fine: but Gerard was an artist, and artists are\nchilled by gaping auditors. He bore up against the yawns a long time;\nbut finding they came from a bottomless reservoir, lost both heart and\ntemper, and suddenly rising in mid narrative, said, \"But I weary our\nhostess, and I am tired myself: so good night!\" whipped a candle off the\ndresser, whispered Denys, \"I cannot stand her,\" and marched to bed in a\nmoment.\n\nThe mijauree coloured and bit her lips. She had not intended her byplay\nfor Gerard's eye: and she saw in a moment she had been rude, and silly,\nand publicly rebuked. She sat with cheek on fire, and a little natural\nwater in her eyes, and looked ten times comelier and more womanly\nand interesting than she had done all day. The desertion of the best\nnarrator broke up the party, and the unassuming Denys approached the\nmeditative mijauree, and invited her in the most flattering terms to\ngamble with him. She started from her reverie, looked him down into the\nearth's centre with chilling dignity, and consented, for she remembered\nall in a moment what a show of hands gambling admitted.\n\nThe soldier and the mijauree rattled the dice. In which sport she was so\ntaken up with her hands, that she forgot to cheat, and Denys won an \"ecu\nau soleil\" of her. She fumbled slowly with her purse, partly because her\nsex do not burn to pay debts of honour, partly to admire the play of\nher little knuckles peeping between their soft white cushions. Denys\nproposed a compromise.\n\n\"Three silver franks I win of you, fair hostess. Give me now three\nkisses of this white hand, and we'll e'en cry quits.\"\n\n\"You are malapert,\" said the lady, with a toss of her head; \"besides,\nthey are so dirty. See! they are like ink!\" and to convince him she put\nthem out to him and turned them up and down. They were no dirtier than\ncream fresh from the cob and she knew it: she was eternally washing and\nscenting them.\n\nDenys read the objection like the observant warrior he was, seized them\nand mumbled them.\n\nFinding him so appreciative of her charm, she said timidly, \"Will you do\nme a kindness, good soldier?\"\n\n\"A thousand, fair hostess, an you will.\"\n\n\"Nay, I ask but one. 'Tis to tell thy comrade I was right sorry to lose\nhis most thrilling story, and I hope he will tell me the rest to-morrow\nmorning. Meantime I shall not sleep for thinking on't. Wilt tell him\nthat--to pleasure me?\"\n\n\"Ay, I'll tell the young savage. But he is not worthy of your\ncondescension, sweet hostess. He would rather be aside a man than a\nwoman any day.\"\n\n\"So would--ahem. He is right: the young women of the day are not worthy\nof him, 'un tas des mijaurees' He has a good, honest, and right comely\nface. Any way, I would not guest of mine should think me unmannerly, not\nfor all the world. Wilt keep faith with me and tell him?\"\n\n\"On this fair hand I swear it; and thus I seal the pledge.\"\n\n\"There; no need to melt the wax, though. Now go to bed. And tell him ere\nyou sleep.\"\n\nThe perverse toad (I thank thee, Manon, for teaching me that word) was\ninclined to bestow her slight affections upon Gerard. Not that she was\ninflammable: far less so than many that passed for prudes in the town.\nBut Gerard possessed a triple attraction that has ensnared coquettes in\nall ages. 1. He was very handsome. 2. He did not admire her the least.\n3. He had given her a good slap in the face.\n\nDenys woke Gerard and gave the message. Gerard was not enchanted \"Dost\nwake a tired man to tell him that? Am I to be pestered with 'mijaurees'\nby night as well as day?\"\n\n\"But I tell thee, novice, thou hast conquered her: trust to my\nexperience: her voice sank to melodious whispers; and the cunning jade\ndid in a manner bribe me to carry thee her challenge to Love's lists!\nfor so I read her message.\"\n\nDenys then, assuming the senior and the man of the world, told Gerard\nthe time was come to show him how a soldier understood friendship\nand camaraderie. Italy was now out of the question. Fate had provided\nbetter; and the blind jade Fortune had smiled on merit for once. \"The\nHead of Gold\" had been a prosperous inn, would be again with a man at\nits head. A good general laid far-sighted plans; but was always ready\nto abandon them, should some brilliant advantage offer, and to reap\nthe full harvest of the unforeseen: 'twas chiefly by this trait great\nleaders defeated little ones; for these latter could do nothing not cut\nand dried beforehand.\n\n\"Sorry friendship, that would marry me to a mijauree,\" interposed\nGerard, yawning.\n\n\"Comrade, be reasonable; 'tis not the friskiest sheep that falls down\nthe cliff. All creatures must have their fling soon, or late; and why\nnot a woman? What more frivolous than a kitten? what graver than a cat?\"\n\n\"Hast a good eye for nature, Denys,\" said Gerard, \"that I proclaim.\n\n\"A better for thine interest, boy. Trust then to me; these little doves\nthey are my study day and night; happy the man whose wife taketh her\nfling before wedlock, and who trippeth up the altar-steps instead of\ndown 'em. Marriage it always changeth them for better or else for worse.\nWhy, Gerard, she is honest when all is done; and he is no man, nor half\na man, that cannot mould any honest lass like a bit of warm wax, and she\naye aside him at bed and board. I tell thee in one month thou wilt make\nof this coquette the matron the most sober in the town, and of all\nits wives the one most docile and submissive. Why, she is half tamed\nalready. Nine in ten meek and mild ones had gently hated thee like\npoison all their lives, for wounding of their hidden pride. But she for\nan affront proffers affection. By Joshua his bugle a generous lass, and\nvoid of petty malice. When thou wast gone she sat a-thinking and spoke\nnot. A sure sign of love in one of her sex: for of all things else\nthey speak ere they think. Also her voice did sink exceeding low in\ndiscoursing of thee, and murmured sweetly; another infallible sign. The\nbolt hath struck and rankles in her; oh, be joyful! Art silent? I\nsee; 'tis settled. I shall go alone to Remiremont, alone and sad. But,\npillage and poleaxes! what care I for that, since my dear comrade will\nstay here, landlord of the 'Tete d'Or,' and safe from all the storms\nof life? Wilt think of me, Gerard, now and then by thy warm fire, of me\ncamped on some windy heath, or lying in wet trenches, or wounded on\nthe field and far from comfort? Nay!\" and this he said in a manner truly\nnoble, \"not comfortless or cold, or wet, or bleeding, 'twill still warm\nmy heart to lie on my back and think that I have placed my dear friend\nand comrade true in the 'Tete d'Or,' far from a soldier's ills.\"\n\n\"I let you run on, dear Denys,\" said Gerard softly, \"because at each\nword you show me the treasure of a good heart. But now bethink thee, my\ntroth is plighted there where my heart it clingeth. You so leal, would\nyou make me disloyal?\"\n\n\"Perdition seize me, but I forgot that,\" said Denys.\n\n\"No more then, but hie thee to bed, good Denys. Next to Margaret I love\nthee best on earth, and value thy 'coeur d'or' far more than a dozen\nof these 'Tetes d'Or.' So prithee call me at the first blush of\nrosy-fingered morn, and let's away ere the woman with the hands be\nstirring.\"\n\nThey rose with the dawn, and broke their fast by the kitchen fire.\n\nDenys inquired of the girl whether the mistress was about.\n\n\"Nay; but she hath risen from her bed: by the same token I am carrying\nher this to clean her withal;\" and she filled a jug with boiling water,\nand took it upstairs.\n\n\"Behold,\" said Gerard, \"the very elements must be warmed to suit her\nskin; what had the saints said, which still chose the coldest pool?\nAway, ere she come down and catch us.\"\n\nThey paid the score, and left the \"Tete d'Or,\" while its mistress was\nwashing her hands.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\nOutside the town they found the snow fresh trampled by innumerable\nwolves every foot of the road.\n\n\"We did well to take the old man's advice, Denys.\"\n\n\"Ay did we. For now I think on't, I did hear them last night scurrying\nunder our window, and howling and whining for man's flesh in yon\nmarket-place. But no fat burgher did pity the poor vagabones, and drop\nout o' window.\"\n\nGerard smiled, but with an air of abstraction. And they plodded on in\nsilence.\n\n\"What dost meditate so profoundly?\"\n\n\"Thy goodness.\"\n\nDenys was anything but pleased at this answer. Amongst his oddities you\nmay have observed that he could stand a great deal of real impertinence;\nhe was so good-humoured. But would fire up now and then where not even\nthe shadow of a ground for anger existed.\n\n\"A civil question merits a civil reply,\" said he very drily.\n\n\"Alas, I meant no other,\" said Gerard.\n\n\"Then why pretend you were thinking of my goodness, when you know I have\nno goodness under my skin?\"\n\n\"Had another said this, I had answered, 'Thou liest.' But to thee I say,\n'Hast no eye for men's qualities, but only for women's.' And once more I\ndo defy thy unreasonable choler, and say I was thinking on thy goodness\nof overnight. Wouldst have wedded me to the 'Tete d'Or' or rather to the\n'tete de veau doree,' and left thyself solitary.\"\n\n\"Oh, are ye there, lad?\" said Denys, recovering his good humour in a\nmoment. \"Well, but to speak sooth, I meant that not for goodness; but\nfor friendship and true fellowship, no more. And let me tell you, my\nyoung master, my conscience it pricketh me even now for letting you turn\nyour back thus on fortune and peaceful days. A truer friend than I had\nta'en and somewhat hamstrung thee. Then hadst thou been fain to lie\nsmarting at the 'Tete d'Or' a month or so; yon skittish lass had nursed\nthee tenderly, and all had been well. Blade I had in hand to do't, but\nremembering how thou hatest pain, though it be but a scratch, my craven\nheart it failed me at the pinch.\" And Denys wore a look of humble\napology for his lack of virtuous resolution when the path of duty lay so\nclear.\n\nGerard raised his eyebrows with astonishment at this monstrous but\nthoroughly characteristic revelation; however, this new and delicate\npoint of friendship was never discussed; viz., whether one ought in\nall love to cut the tendon Achilles of one's friend. For an incident\ninterposed.\n\n\"Here cometh one in our rear a-riding on his neighbour's mule,\" shouted\nDenys.\n\nGerard turned round. \"And how know ye 'tis not his own, pray?\"\n\n\"Oh, blind! Because he rides it with no discretion.\"\n\nAnd in truth the man came galloping like a fury. But what astonished the\nfriends most was that on reaching them the rustic rider's eyes opened\nsaucer-like, and he drew the rein so suddenly and powerfully, that the\nmule stuck out her fore-legs, and went sliding between the pedestrians\nlike a four-legged table on castors.\n\n\"I trow ye are from the 'Tete d'Or?'\" They assented. \"Which of ye is the\nyounger?\"\n\n\"He that was born the later,\" said Denys, winking at his companion.\n\n\"Gramercy for the news.\"\n\n\"Come, divine then!\"\n\n\"And shall. Thy beard is ripe, thy fellow's is green; he shall be the\nyounger; here, youngster.\" And he held him out a paper packet. \"Ye left\nthis at the 'Tete d'Or,' and our mistress sends it ye.\"\n\n\"Nay, good fellow, methinks I left nought.\" And Gerard felt his pouch.\netc.\n\n\"Would ye make our burgess a liar,\" said the rustic reproachfully; \"and\nshall I have no pourboire?\" (still more reproachfully); \"and came ventre\na terre.\"\n\n\"Nay, thou shalt have pourboire,\" and he gave him a small coin.\n\n\"A la bonne heure,\" cried the clown, and his features beamed with\ndisproportionate joy. \"The Virgin go with ye; come up, Jenny!\" and back\nhe went \"stomach to earth,\" as his nation is pleased to call it.\n\nGerard undid the packet; it was about six inches square, and inside it\nhe found another packet, which contained a packet, and so on. At the\nfourth he hurled the whole thing into the snow. Denys took it out\nand rebuked his petulance. He excused himself on the ground of hating\naffectation.\n\nDenys attested, \"'The great toe of the little daughter of Herodias'\nthere was no affectation here, but only woman's good wit. Doubtless the\nwraps contained something which out of delicacy, or her sex's lovely\ncunning, she would not her hind should see her bestow on a young man;\nthy garter, to wit.\"\n\n\"I wear none.\"\n\n\"Her own then; or a lock of her hair. What is this? A piece of raw silk\nfresh from the worm. Well, of all the love tokens!\"\n\n\"Now who but thee ever dreamed that she is so naught as send me love\ntokens? I saw no harm in her--barring her hands.\"\n\n\"Stay, here is something hard lurking in this soft nest. Come forth, I\nsay, little nestling! Saints and pikestaves! look at this!\"\n\nIt was a gold ring with a great amethyst glowing and sparkling, full\ncoloured, but pure as crystal.\n\n\"How lovely!\" said Gerard innocently.\n\n\"And here is something writ; read it thou! I read not so glib as some,\nwhen I know not the matter beforehand.\"\n\nGerard took the paper. \"'Tis a posy, and fairly enough writ.\" He read\nthe lines, blushing like a girl. They were very naive, and may be thus\nEnglished:--\n\n     'Youth, with thee my heart is fledde,\n     Come back to the 'golden Hedde!'\n     Wilt not? yet this token keepe\n     Of hir who doeth thy goeing weepe.\n     Gyf the world prove harsh and cold,\n     Come back to 'the Hedde of gold.'\"\n\n\"The little dove!\" purred Denys.\n\n\"The great owl! To go and risk her good name thus. However, thank Heaven\nshe has played this prank with an honest lad that will ne'er expose her\nfolly. But oh, the perverseness! Could she not bestow her nauseousness\non thee?\" Denys sighed and shrugged. \"On thee that art as ripe for folly\nas herself?\"\n\nDenys confessed that his young friend had harped his very thought. 'Twas\npassing strange to him that a damsel with eyes in her head should pass\nby a man, and bestow her affections on a boy. Still he could not but\nrecognize in this the bounty of Nature. Boys were human beings after\nall, and but for this occasional caprice of women, their lot would be\ntoo terrible; they would be out of the sun altogether, blighted, and\nnever come to anything; since only the fair could make a man out of\nsuch unpromising materials as a boy. Gerard interrupted this flattering\ndiscourse to beg the warrior-philosopher's acceptance of the lady's\nring. He refused it flatly, and insisted on Gerard going back to the\n\"Tete d'Or\" at once, ring and all, like a man, and not letting a poor\ngirl hold out her arms to him in vain.\n\n\"Her hands, you mean.\"\n\n\"Her hand, with the 'Tete d'Or' in it.\"\n\nFailing in this, he was for putting the ring on his friend's finger.\nGerard declined. \"I wear a ring already.\"\n\n\"What, that sorry gimcrack? why, 'tis pewter, or tin at best: and this\nvirgin gold, forbye the jewel.\"\n\n\"Ay, but 'twas Margaret gave me this one; and I value it above rubies.\nI'll neither part with it nor give it a rival,\" and he kissed the base\nmetal, and bade it fear nought.\n\n\"I see the owl hath sent her ring to a goose,\" said Denys sorrowfully.\nHowever, he prevailed on Gerard to fasten it inside his bonnet. To this,\nindeed, the lad consented very readily. For sovereign qualities were\nuniversally ascribed to certain jewels; and the amethyst ranked high\namong these precious talismans.\n\nWhen this was disposed of, Gerard earnestly requested his friend to let\nthe matter drop, since speaking of the other sex to him made him pine\nso for Margaret, and almost unmanned him with the thought that each step\nwas taking him farther from her. \"I am no general lover, Denys. There is\nroom in my heart for one sweetheart, and for one friend. I am far from\nmy dear mistress; and my friend, a few leagues more, and I must lose him\ntoo. Oh, let me drink thy friendship pure while I may, and not dilute\nwith any of these stupid females.\"\n\n\"And shalt, honey-pot, and shalt,\" said Denys kindly'. \"But as to\nmy leaving thee at Remiremont, reckon thou not on that! For\" (three\nconsecutive oaths) \"if I do. Nay, I shall propose to thee to stay\nforty-eight hours there, while I kiss my mother and sisters, and the\nfemales generally, and on go you and I together to the sea.\"\n\n\"Denys! Denys!\"\n\n\"Denys nor me! 'Tis settled. Gainsay me not! or I'll go with thee\nto Rome. Why not? his Holiness the Pope hath ever some little merry\npleasant war toward, and a Burgundian soldier is still welcome in his\nranks.\"\n\nOn this Gerard opened his heart. \"Denys, ere I fell in with thee, I used\noften to halt on the road, unable to go farther: my puny heart so pulled\nme back: and then, after a short prayer to the saints for aid, would I\nrise and drag my most unwilling body onward. But since I joined company\nwith thee, great is my courage. I have found the saying of the\nancients true, that better is a bright comrade on the weary road than\na horse-litter; and, dear brother, when I do think of what we have done\nand suffered together! Savedst my life from the bear, and from yet\nmore savage thieves; and even poor I did make shift to draw thee out\nof Rhine, and somehow loved thee double from that hour. How many ties\ntender and strong between us! Had I my will, I'd never, never, never,\nnever part with my Denys on this side the grave. Well-a-day! God His\nwill be done.\n\n\"No, my will shall be done this time,\" shouted Denys. \"Le bon Dieu has\nbigger fish to fry than you or me. I'll go with thee to Rome. There is\nmy hand on it.\"\n\n\"Think what, you say! 'Tis impossible. 'Tis too selfish of me.\"\n\n\"I tell thee, 'tis settled. No power can change me. At Remiremont I\nborrow ten pieces of my uncle, and on we go; 'tis fixed.\"\n\nThey shook hands over it. Then Gerard said nothing, for his heart was\ntoo full; but he ran twice round his companion as he walked, then danced\nbackwards in front of him, and finally took his hand, and so on they\nwent hand in hand like sweethearts, till a company of mounted soldiers,\nabout fifty in number, rose to sight on the brow of a hill.\n\n\"See the banner of Burgundy,\" said Denys joyfully; \"I shall look out for\na comrade among these.\"\n\n\"How gorgeous is the standard in the sun,\" said Gerard \"and how brave\nare the leaders with velvet and feathers, and steel breastplates like\nglassy mirrors!\"\n\nWhen they came near enough to distinguish faces, Denys uttered an\nexclamation: \"Why, 'tis the Bastard of Burgundy, as I live. Nay, then;\nthere is fighting a-foot since he is out; a gallant leader, Gerard,\nrates his life no higher than a private soldier's, and a soldier's no\nhigher than a tomtit's; and that is the captain for me.\"\n\n\"And see, Denys, the very mules with their great brass frontlets and\ntrappings seem proud to carry them; no wonder men itch to be soldiers;\"\nand in the midst of this innocent admiration the troop came up with\nthem.\n\n\"Halt!\" cried a stentorian voice. The troop halted. The Bastard of\nBurgundy bent his brow gloomily on Denys: \"How now, arbalestrier, how\ncomes it thy face is turned southward, when every good hand and heart is\nhurrying northward?\"\n\nDenys replied respectfully that he was going on leave, after some years\nof service, to see his kindred at Remiremont.\n\n\"Good. But this is not the time for't; the duchy is disturbed. Ho! bring\nthat dead soldier's mule to the front; and thou mount her and forward\nwith us to Flanders.\"\n\n\"So please your highness,\" said Denys firmly, \"that may not be. My home\nis close at hand. I have not seen it these three years; and above all, I\nhave this poor youth in charge, whom I may not, cannot leave, till I see\nhim shipped for Rome.\n\n\"Dost bandy words with me?\" said the chief, with amazement, turning fast\nto wrath. \"Art weary o' thy life? Let go the youth's hand, and into the\nsaddle without more idle words.\"\n\nDenys made no reply; but he held Gerard's hand the tighter, and looked\ndefiance.\n\nAt this the bastard roared, \"Jarnac, dismount six of thy archers, and\nshoot me this white-livered cur dead where he stands--for an example.\"\n\nThe young Count de Jarnac, second in command, gave the order, and the\nmen dismounted to execute it.\n\n\"Strip him naked,\" said the bastard, in the cold tone of military\nbusiness, \"and put his arms and accoutrements on the spare mule We'll\nmaybe find some clown worthier to wear them.\"\n\nDenys groaned aloud, \"Am I to be shamed as well as slain?\"\n\n\"Oh, nay! nay! nay!\" cried Gerard, awaking from the stupor into which\nthis thunderbolt of tyranny had thrown him. \"He shall go with you on the\ninstant. I'd liever part with him for ever than see a hair of his dear\nhead harmed Oh, sir, oh, my lord, give a poor boy but a minute to bid\nhis only friend farewell! he will go with you. I swear he shall go with\nyou.\"\n\nThe stern leader nodded a cold contemptuous assent. \"Thou, Jarnac, stay\nwith them, and bring him on alive or dead. Forward!\" And he resumed his\nmarch, followed by all the band but the young count and six archers, one\nof whom held the spare mule.\n\nDenys and Gerard gazed at one another haggardly. Oh, what a look!\n\nAnd after this mute interchange of anguish, they spoke hurriedly, for\nthe moments were flying by.\n\n\"Thou goest to Holland: thou knowest where she bides. Tell her all. She\nwill be kind to thee for my sake.\"\n\n\"Oh, sorry tale that I shall carry her! For God's sake, go back to the\n'Tete d'Or.' I am mad!\"\n\n\"Hush! Let me think: have I nought to say to thee, Denys? my head! my\nhead!\"\n\n\"Ah! I have it. Make for the Rhine, Gerard! Strasbourg. 'Tis but a step.\nAnd down the current to Rotterdam. Margaret is there: I go thither. I'll\ntell her thou art coming. We shall all be together.\"\n\n\"My lads, haste ye, or you will get us into trouble,\" said the count\nfirmly, but not harshly now.\n\n\"Oh, sir, one moment! one little moment!\" panted Gerard.\n\n\"Cursed be the land I 'was born in! cursed be the race of man! and he\nthat made them what they are!\" screamed Denys.\n\n\"Hush, Denys, hush! blaspheme not! Oh, God forgive him, he wots not what\nhe says. Be patient, Denys, be patient: though we meet no more on earth,\nlet us meet in a better world, where no blasphemer may enter. To my\nheart, lost friend; for what are words now?\" He held out his arms, and\nthey locked one another in a close embrace. They kissed one another\nagain and again, speechless, and the tears rained down their cheeks And\nthe Count Jarnac looked on amazed, but the rougher soldiers, to whom\ncomrade was a sacred name, looked on with some pity in their hard\nfaces. Then at a signal from Jarnac, with kind force and words of rude\nconsolation, they almost lifted Denys on to the mule; and putting him\nin the middle of them, spurred after their leader. And Gerard ran wildly\nafter (for the lane turned), to see the very last of him; and the last\nglimpse he caught, Denys was rocking to and fro on his mule, and tearing\nhis hair out. But at this sight something rose in Gerard's throat so\nhigh, so high, he could run no more nor breathe, but gasped, and leaned\nagainst the snow-clad hedge, seizing it, and choking piteously.\n\nThe thorns ran into his hand.\n\nAfter a bitter struggle he got his breath again; and now began to see\nhis own misfortune. Yet not all at once to realize it, so sudden and\nnumbing was the stroke. He staggered on, but scarce feeling or caring\nwhither he was going; and every now and then he stopped, and his arms\nfell and his head sank on his chest, and he stood motionless: then he\nsaid to himself, \"Can this thing be? this must be a dream. 'Tis scarce\nfive minutes since we were so happy, walking handed, faring to Rome\ntogether, and we admired them and their gay banners and helmets oh\nhearts of hell!\"\n\nAll nature seemed to stare now as lonely as himself. Not a creature in\nsight. No colour but white. He, the ghost of his former self, wandered\nalone among the ghosts of trees, and fields, and hedges. Desolate!\ndesolate! desolate! All was desolate.\n\nHe knelt and gathered a little snow. \"Nay, I dream not; for this is\nsnow: cold as the world's heart. It is bloody, too: what may that\nmean? Fool! 'tis from thy hand. I mind not the wound Ay, I see: thorns.\nWelcome! kindly foes: I felt ye not, ye ran not into my heart. Ye are\nnot cruel like men.\"\n\nHe had risen, and was dragging his leaden limbs along, when he heard\nhorses' feet and gay voices behind him. He turned with a joyful but wild\nhope that the soldiers had relented and were bringing Denys back. But\nno, it was a gay cavalcade. A gentleman of rank and his favourites in\nvelvet and furs and feathers; and four or five armed retainers in buff\njerkins.\n\nThey swept gaily by.\n\nGerard never looked at them after they were gone by: certain gay shadows\nhad come and passed; that was all. He was like one in a dream. But he\nwas rudely wakened; suddenly a voice in front of him cried harshly,\n\"Stand and deliver!\" and there were three of the gentleman's servants in\nfront of him. They had ridden back to rob him.\n\n\"How, ye false knaves,\" said he, quite calmly; \"would ye shame your\nnoble master? He will hang ye to the nearest tree;\" and with these words\nhe drew his sword doggedly, and set his back to the hedge.\n\nOne of the men instantly levelled his petronel at him.\n\nBut another, less sanguinary, interposed. \"Be not so hasty! And be not\nthou so mad! Look yonder!\"\n\nGerard looked, and scarce a hundred yards off the nobleman and his\nfriends had halted, and sat on their horses, looking at the lawless\nact, too proud to do their own dirty work, but not too proud to reap\nthe fruit, and watch lest their agents should rob them of another man's\nmoney.\n\nThe milder servant then, a good-natured fellow, showed Gerard resistance\nwas vain; reminded him common thieves often took the life as well as the\npurse, and assured him it cost a mint to be a gentleman; his master had\nlost money at play overnight, and was going to visit his leman, and so\nmust take money where he saw it.\n\n\"Therefore, good youth, consider that we rob not for ourselves, and\ndeliver us that fat purse at thy girdle without more ado, nor put us to\nthe pain of slitting thy throat and taking it all the same.\"\n\n\"This knave is right,\" said Gerard calmly aloud but to himself. \"I\nought not to fling away my life; Margaret would be so sorry. Take then\nthe poor man's purse to the rich man's pouch; and with it this; tell\nhim, I pray the Holy Trinity each coin in it may burn his hand, and\nfreeze his heart, and blast his soul for ever. Begone and leave me to my\nsorrow!\" He flung them the purse.\n\nThey rode away muttering; for his words pricked them a little; a very\nlittle: and he staggered on, penniless now as well as friendless, till\nhe came to the edge of a wood. Then, though his heart could hardly feel\nthis second blow, his judgment did; and he began to ask himself what was\nthe use going further? He sat down on the hard road, and ran his nails\ninto his hair, and tried to think for the best; a task all the more\ndifficult that a strange drowsiness was stealing over him. Rome he could\nnever reach without money. Denys had said, \"Go to Strasbourg, and down\nthe Rhine home.\" He would obey Denys. But how to get to Strasbourg\nwithout money?\n\nThen suddenly seemed to ring in his ears--\n\n     \"Gyf the world prove harsh and cold,\n     Come back to the hedde of gold.\"\n\n\"And if I do I must go as her servant; I who am Margaret's. I am\na-weary, a-weary. I will sleep, and dream all is as it was. Ah me, how\nhappy were we an hour agone, we little knew how happy. There is a house:\nthe owner well-to-do. What if I told him my wrong, and prayed his aid\nto retrieve my purse, and so to Rhine? Fool! is he not a man, like the\nrest? He would scorn me and trample me lower. Denys cursed the race of\nmen. That will I never; but oh, I begin to loathe and dread them. Nay,\nhere will I lie till sunset: then darkling creep into this rich man's\nbarn, and take by stealth a draught of milk or a handful o' grain, to\nkeep body and soul together. God, who hath seen the rich rob me, will\nperadventure forgive me. They say 'tis ill sleeping on the snow. Death\nsteals on such sleepers with muffled feet and honey breath. But what can\nI? I am a-weary, a-weary. Shall this be the wood where lie the wolves\nyon old man spoke of? I must e'en trust them: they are not men; and I am\nso a-weary.\"\n\nHe crawled to the roadside, and stretched out his limbs on the snow,\nwith a deep sigh.\n\n\"Ah, tear not thine hair so! teareth my heart to see thee.\"\n\n\"Margaret. Never see me more. Poor Margaret.\"\n\nAnd the too tender heart was still.\n\nAnd the constant lover, and friend of antique mould, lay silent on the\nsnow; in peril from the weather, in peril from wild beasts, in peril\nfrom hunger, friendless and penniless in a strange land, and not halfway\nto Rome.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\nRude travel is enticing to us English. And so are its records; even\nthough the adventurer be no pilgrim of love. And antique friendship has\nat least the interest of a fossil. Still, as the true centre of this\nstory is in Holland, it is full time to return thither, and to those\nordinary personages and incidents whereof life has been mainly composed\nin all ages.\n\nJorian Ketel came to Peter's house to claim Margaret's promise; but\nMargaret was ill in bed, and Peter, on hearing his errand, affronted him\nand warned him off the premises, and one or two that stood by were for\nducking him; for both father and daughter were favourites, and the\nwhole story was in every mouth, and Sevenbergens in that state of hot,\nundiscriminating irritation which accompanies popular sympathy.\n\nSo Jorian Ketel went off in dudgeon, and repented him of his good deed.\nThis sort of penitence is not rare, and has the merit of being sincere.\nDierich Brower, who was discovered at \"The Three Kings,\" making a\nchatterbox drunk in order to worm out of him the whereabouts of Martin\nWittenhaagen, was actually taken and flung into a horsepond, and\nthreatened with worse usage, should he ever show his face in the burgh\nagain; and finally, municipal jealousy being roused, the burgomaster\nof Sevenbergen sent a formal missive to the burgomaster of Tergou,\nreminding him he had overstepped the law, and requesting him to apply to\nthe authorities of Sevenbergen on any future occasion when he might have\na complaint, real or imaginary, against any of its townsfolk.\n\nThe wily Ghysbrecht, suppressing his rage at this remonstrance,\nsent back a civil message to say that the person he had followed to\nSevenbergen was a Tergovian, one Gerard, and that he had stolen the town\nrecords: that Gerard having escaped into foreign parts, and probably\ntaken the documents with him, the whole matter was at an end.\n\nThus he made a virtue of necessity. But in reality his calmness was but\na veil: baffled at Sevenbergen, he turned his views elsewhere he set his\nemissaries to learn from the family at Tergou whither Gerard had fled,\nand \"to his infinite surprise\" they did not know. This added to\nhis uneasiness. It made him fear Gerard was only lurking in the\nneighbourhood: he would make a certain discovery, and would come back\nand take a terrible revenge. From this time Dierich and others that were\nabout him noticed a change for the worse in Ghysbrecht Van Swieten. He\nbecame a moody irritable man. A dread lay on him. His eyes cast furtive\nglances, like one who expects a blow, and knows not from what quarter\nit is to come. Making others wretched had not made him happy. It seldom\ndoes.\n\nThe little family at Tergou, which, but for his violent interference,\nmight in time have cemented its difference without banishing spem gregis\nto a distant land, wore still the same outward features, but within was\nno longer the simple happy family this tale opened with. Little Kate\nknew the share Cornelis and Sybrandt had in banishing Gerard, and\nthough, for fear of making more mischief still, she never told her\nmother, yet there were times she shuddered at the bare sight of them,\nand blushed at their hypocritical regrets. Catherine, with a woman's\nvigilance, noticed this, and with a woman's subtlety said nothing, but\nquietly pondered it, and went on watching for more. The black sheep\nthemselves, in their efforts to partake in the general gloom and sorrow,\nsucceeded so far as to impose upon their father and Giles: but the\ndemure satisfaction that lay at their bottom could not escape these\nfeminine eyes--\n\n\"That, noting all, seem nought to note.\"\n\nThus mistrust and suspicion sat at the table, poor substitutes for\nGerard's intelligent face, that had brightened the whole circle,\nunobserved till it was gone. As for the old hosier his pride had been\nwounded by his son's disobedience, and so he bore stiffly up, and did\nhis best never to mention Gerard's name; but underneath his Spartan\ncloak, Nature might be seen tugging at his heart-strings. One anxiety he\nnever affected to conceal. \"If I but knew where the boy is, and that his\nlife and health are in no danger, small would be my care,\" would he say;\nand then a deep sigh would follow. I cannot help thinking that if Gerard\nhad opened the door just then, and walked in, there would have been many\ntears and embraces for him, and few reproaches, or none.\n\nOne thing took the old couple quite by surprise--publicity. Ere Gerard\nhad been gone a week, his adventures were in every mouth; and to make\nmatters worse, the popular sympathy declared itself warmly on the side\nof the lovers, and against Gerard's cruel parents, and that old busybody\nthe burgomaster, who must put his nose into a business that nowise\nconcerned him.\n\n\"Mother,\" said Kate, \"it is all over the town that Margaret is down with\na fever--a burning fever; her father fears her sadly.\"\n\n\"Margaret? what Margaret?\" inquired Catherine, with a treacherous\nassumption of calmness and indifference.\n\n\"Oh, mother! whom should I mean? Why, Gerard's Margaret.\"\n\n\"Gerard's Margaret,\" screamed Catherine; \"how dare you say such a word\nto me? And I rede you never mention that hussy's name in this house,\nthat she has laid bare. She is the ruin of my poor boy, the flower of\nall my flock. She is the cause that he is not a holy priest in the midst\nof us, but is roaming the world, and I a desolate broken-hearted mother.\nThere, do not cry, my girl, I do ill to speak harsh to you. But oh,\nKate! you know not what passes in a mother's heart. I bear up before\nyou all; it behoves me swallow my fears; but at night I see him in my\ndreams, and still some trouble or other near him: sometimes he is torn\nby wild beasts; other times he is in the hands of robbers, and their\ncruel knives uplifted to strike his poor pale face, that one should\nthink would move a stone. Oh! when I remember that, while I sit here\nin comfort, perhaps my poor boy lies dead in some savage place, and all\nalong of that girl: there, her very name is ratsbane to me. I tremble\nall over when I hear it.\"\n\n\"I'll not say anything, nor do anything to grieve you worse, mother,\"\nsaid Kate tenderly; but she sighed.\n\nShe whose name was so fiercely interdicted in this house was much spoken\nof, and even pitied elsewhere. All Sevenbergen was sorry for her, and\nthe young men and maidens cast many a pitying glance, as they passed, at\nthe little window where the beauty of the village lay \"dying for love.\"\nIn this familiar phrase they underrated her spirit and unselfishness.\nGerard was not dead, and she was too loyal herself to doubt his\nconstancy. Her father was dear to her and helpless; and but for bodily\nweakness, all her love for Gerard would not have kept her from doing\nher duties, though she might have gone about them with drooping head and\nheavy heart. But physical and mental excitement had brought on an attack\nof fever so violent, that nothing but youth and constitution saved\nher. The malady left her at last, but in that terrible state of bodily\nweakness in which the patient feels life a burden.\n\nThen it is that love and friendship by the bedside are mortal angels\nwith comfort in their voice, and healing in their palms.\n\nBut this poor girl had to come back to life and vigour how she could.\nMany days she lay alone, and the heavy hours rolled like leaden waves\nover her. In her enfeebled state existence seemed a burden, and life a\nthing gone by. She could not try her best to get well. Gerard was gone.\nShe had not him to get well for. Often she lay for hours quite still,\nwith the tears welling gently out of her eyes.\n\nOne day, waking from an uneasy slumber, she found two women in her room,\nOne was a servant, the other by the deep fur on her collar and sleeves\nwas a person of consideration: a narrow band of silvery hair, being\nspared by her coiffure, showed her to be past the age when women of\nsense concealed their years. The looks of both were kind and friendly.\nMargaret tried to raise herself in the bed, but the old lady placed a\nhand very gently on her.\n\n\"Lie still, sweetheart; we come not here to put you about, but to\ncomfort you, God willing. Now cheer up a bit, and tell us, first, who\nthink you we are?\"\n\n\"Nay, madam, I know you, though I never saw you before: you are the\ndemoiselle Van Eyck, and this is Reicht Heynes. Gerard has oft spoken of\nyou, and of your goodness to him. Madam, he has no friend like you near\nhim now,\" and at this thought she lay back, and the tears welled out of\nher eyes in a moment.\n\nThe good-natured Reicht Heynes began to cry for company; but her\nmistress scolded her. \"Well, you are a pretty one for a sick-room,\" said\nshe; and she put out a world of innocent art to cheer the patient; and\nnot without some little success. An old woman, that has seen life and\nall its troubles, is a sovereign blessing by a sorrowful young woman's\nside. She knows what to say, and what to avoid. She knows how to soothe\nher and interest her. Ere she had been there an hour, she had Margaret's\nhead lying on her shoulder instead of on the pillow, and Margaret's soft\neyes dwelling on her with gentle gratitude.\n\n\"Ah! this is hair,\" said the old lady, running her fingers through it.\n\"Come and look at it, Reicht!\"\n\nReicht came and handled it, and praised it unaffectedly. The poor\ngirl that owned it was not quite out of the reach of flattery; owing\ndoubtless to not being dead.\n\n\"In sooth, madam, I did use to think it hideous; but he praised it, and\never since then I have been almost vain of it, saints forgive me. You\nknow how foolish those are that love.\"\n\n\"They are greater fools that don't,\" said the old lady, sharply.\n\nMargaret opened her lovely eyes, and looked at her for her meaning.\n\nThis was only the first of many visits. In fact either Margaret Van Eyck\nor Reicht came nearly every day until their patient was convalescent;\nand she improved rapidly under their hands. Reicht attributed this\nprincipally to certain nourishing dishes she prepared in Peter's\nkitchen; but Margaret herself thought more of the kind words and eyes\nthat kept telling her she had friends to live for.\n\n\nMartin Wittenhaagen went straight to Rotterdam, to take the bull by the\nhorns. The bull was a biped, with a crown for horns. It was Philip\nthe Good, duke of this, earl of that, lord of the other. Arrived at\nRotterdam, Martin found the court was at Ghent. To Ghent he went, and\nsought an audience, but was put off and baffled by lackeys and pages. So\nhe threw himself in his sovereign's way out hunting, and contrary to\nall court precedents, commenced the conversation--by roaring lustily for\nmercy.\n\n\"Why, where is the peril, man?\" said the duke, looking all round and\nlaughing.\n\n\"Grace for an old soldier hunted down by burghers!\"\n\nNow kings differ in character like other folk; but there is one trait\nthey have in common; they are mightily inclined to be affable to men\nof very low estate. These do not vie with them in anything whatever,\nso jealousy cannot creep in; and they amuse them by their bluntness and\nnovelty, and refresh the poor things with a touch of nature--a rarity in\ncourts. So Philip the Good reined in his horse and gave Martin almost a\ntete-a-tete, and Martin reminded him of a certain battlefield where he\nhad received an arrow intended for his sovereign. The duke remembered\nthe incident perfectly, and was graciously pleased to take a cheerful\nview of it. He could afford to, not having been the one hit. Then\nMartin told his majesty of Gerard's first capture in the church, his\nimprisonment in the tower, and the manoeuvre by which they got him out,\nand all the details of the hunt; and whether he told it better than\nI have, or the duke had not heard so many good stories as you have,\ncertain it is that sovereign got so wrapt up in it, that, when a number\nof courtiers came galloping up and interrupted Martin, he swore like\na costermonger, and threatened, only half in jest, to cut off the next\nhead that should come between him and a good story; and when Martin had\ndone, he cried out--\n\n\"St. Luke! what sport goeth on in this mine earldom, ay! in my own\nwoods, and I see it not. You base fellows have all the luck.\" And he\nwas indignant at the partiality of Fortune. \"Lo you now! this was a\nman-hunt,\" said he. \"I never had the luck to be at a man-hunt.\"\n\n\"My luck was none so great,\" replied Martin bluntly: \"I was on the wrong\nside of the dogs' noses.\"\n\n\"Ah! so you were; I forgot that.\" And royalty was more reconciled to its\nlot. \"What would you then?\"\n\n\"A free pardon, your highness, for myself and Gerard.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"For prison-breaking.\"\n\n\"Go to; the bird will fly from the cage. 'Tis instinct. Besides, coop a\nyoung man up for loving a young woman? These burgomasters must be void\nof common sense. What else?\"\n\n\"For striking down the burgomaster.\"\n\n\"Oh, the hunted boar will turn to bay. 'Tis his right; and I hold him\nless than man that grudges it him. What else?\"\n\n\"For killing of the bloodhounds.\"\n\nThe duke's countenance fell.\n\n\"'Twas their life or mine,\" said Martin eagerly.\n\n\"Ay! but I can't have, my bloodhounds, my beautiful bloodhounds,\nsacrificed to--\n\n\"No, no, no! They were not your dogs.\"\n\n\"Whose dogs, then?\"\n\n\"The ranger's.\"\n\n\"Oh. Well, I am very sorry for him, but as I was saying I can't have\nmy old soldiers sacrificed to his bloodhounds. Thou shalt have thy free\npardon.\"\n\n\"And poor Gerard.\"\n\n\"And poor Gerard too, for thy sake. And more, tell thou this burgomaster\nhis doings mislike me: this is to set up for a king, not a burgomaster.\nI'll have no kings in Holland but one. Bid him be more humble; or by St.\nJude I'll hang him before his own door, as I hanged the burgomaster\nof what's the name, some town or other in Flanders it was; no, 'twas'\nsomewhere in Brabant--no matter--I hanged him, I remember that much--for\noppressing poor folk.\"\n\nThe duke then beckoned his chancellor, a pursy old fellow that rode like\na sack, and bade him write out a free pardon for Martin and one Gerard.\n\nThis precious document was drawn up in form, and signed next day, and\nMartin hastened home with it.\n\nMargaret had left her bed some days, and was sitting pale and pensive\nby the fireside, when he burst in, waving the parchment, and crying, \"A\nfree pardon, girl, for Gerard as well as me! Send for him back when you\nwill; all the burgomasters on earth daren't lay a finger on him.\"\n\nShe flushed all over with joy and her hands trembled with eagerness\nas she took the parchment and devoured it with her eyes, and kissed it\nagain and again, and flung her arms round Martin's neck, and kissed him.\nWhen she was calmer, she told him Heaven had raised her up a friend in\nthe dame Van Eyck. \"And I would fain consult her on this good news; but\nI have not strength to walk so far.\"\n\n\"What need to walk? There is my mule.\"\n\n\"Your mule, Martin?\"\n\nThe old soldier or professional pillager laughed, and confessed he\nhad got so used to her, that he forgot at times Ghysbrecht had a prior\nclaim. To-morrow he would turn her into the burgomaster's yard, but\nto-night she should carry Margaret to Tergou.\n\nIt was nearly dusk; so Margaret ventured, and about seven in the evening\nshe astonished and gladdened her new but ardent friend, by arriving at\nher house with unwonted roses on her cheeks, and Gerard's pardon in her\nbosom.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\nSome are old in heart at forty, some are young at eighty. Margaret\nVan Eyck's heart was an evergreen. She loved her young namesake with\nyouthful ardour. Nor was this new sentiment a mere caprice; she was\nquick at reading character, and saw in Margaret Brandt that which in\none of her own sex goes far with an intelligent woman; genuineness. But,\nbesides her own sterling qualities, Margaret had from the first a potent\nally in the old artist's bosom.\n\nHuman nature.\n\nStrange as it may appear to the unobservant, our hearts warm more\nreadily to those we have benefited than to our benefactors. Some of the\nGreek philosophers noticed this; but the British Homer has stamped it in\nimmortal lines:--\n\n     \"I heard, and thought how side by side\n     We two had stemmed the battle's tide\n     In many a well-debated field,\n     Where Bertram's breast was Philip's shield.\n     I thought on Darien's deserts pale,\n     Where Death bestrides the evening gale,\n     How o'er my friend my cloak I threw,\n     And fenceless faced the deadly dew.\n     I thought on Quariana's cliff,\n     Where, rescued from our foundering skiff,\n     Through the white breakers' wrath I bore\n     Exhausted Bertram to the shore:\n     And when his side an arrow found,\n     I sucked the Indian's venom'd wound.\n     These thoughts like torrents rushed along\n     To sweep away my purpose strong.\"\n\nObserve! this assassin's hand is stayed by memory, not of benefits\nreceived, but benefits conferred.\n\nNow Margaret Van Eyck had been wonderfully kind to Margaret Brandt; had\nbroken through her own habits to go and see her; had nursed her, and\nsoothed her, and petted her, and cured her more than all the medicine in\nthe world. So her heart opened to the recipient of her goodness, and she\nloved her now far more tenderly than she had ever loved Gerard, though,\nin truth, it was purely out of regard for Gerard she had visited her in\nthe first instance.\n\nWhen, therefore, she saw the roses on Margaret's cheek, and read the\nbit of parchment that had brought them there, she gave up her own views\nwithout a murmur.\n\n\"Sweetheart,\" said she, \"I did desire he should stay in Italy five\nor six years, and come back rich, and above all, an artist. But your\nhappiness is before all, and I see you cannot live without him, so we\nmust have him home as fast as may be.\"\n\n\"Ah, madam! you see my very thoughts.\" And the young woman hung her head\na moment and blushed. \"But how to let him know, madam? That passes my\nskill. He is gone to Italy; but what part I know not. Stay! he named the\ncities he should visit. Florence was one, and Rome.\" But then--Finally,\nbeing a sensible girl, she divined that a letter, addressed, \"My\nGerard--Italy,\" might chance to miscarry, and she looked imploringly at\nher friend for counsel.\n\n\"You are come to the right place, and at the right time,\" said the old\nlady. \"Here was this Hans Memling with me to-day; he is going to Italy,\ngirl, no later than next week, 'to improve his hand,' he says. Not\nbefore 'twas needed, I do assure you.\"\n\n\"But how is he to find my Gerard?\"\n\n\"Why, he knows your Gerard, child. They have supped here more than\nonce, and were like hand and glove. Now, as his business is the same as\nGerard's, he will visit the same places as Gerard, and soon or late he\nmust fall in with him. Wherefore, get you a long letter written, and\ncopy out this pardon into it, and I'll answer for the messenger. In six\nmonths at farthest Gerard shall get it; and when he shall get it, then\nwill he kiss it, and put it in his bosom, and come flying home. What are\nyou smiling at? And now what makes your cheeks so red? And what you\nare smothering me for, I cannot think. Yes! happy days are coming to my\nlittle pearl.\"\n\nMeantime, Martin sat in the kitchen, with the black-jack before him and\nReicht Heynes spinning beside him: and, wow! but she pumped him that\nnight.\n\n\nThis Hans Memling was an old pupil of Jan Van Eyck and his sister. He\nwas a painter notwithstanding Margaret's sneer, and a good soul enough,\nwith one fault. He loved the \"nipperkin, canakin, and the brown bowl\"\nmore than they deserve. This singular penchant kept him from amassing\nfortune, and was the cause that he often came to Margaret Van Eyck for\na meal, and sometimes for a groat. But this gave her a claim on him, and\nshe knew he would not trifle with any commission she should entrust to\nhim.\n\nThe letter was duly written and left with Margaret Van Eyck; and the\nfollowing week, sure enough, Hans Memling returned from Flanders,\nMargaret Van Eyck gave him the letter, and a piece of gold towards his\ntravelling expenses. He seemed in a hurry to be off.\n\n\"All the better,\" said the old artist; \"he will be the sooner in Italy.\"\n\nBut as there are horses who burn and rage to start, and after the first\nyard or two want the whip, so all this hurry cooled into inaction when\nHans got as far as the principal hostelry of Tergou, and saw two of\nhis boon companions sitting in the bay window. He went in for a parting\nglass with them; but when he offered to pay, they would not hear of it,\nNo; he was going a long journey; they would treat him; everybody must\ntreat him, the landlord and all.\n\nIt resulted from this treatment that his tongue got as loose as if the\nwine had been oil; and he confided to the convivial crew that he was\ngoing to show the Italians how to paint: next he sang his exploits\nin battle, for he had handled a pike; and his amorous successes with\nfemales, not present to oppose their version of the incidents. In short,\n\"plenus rimarum erat: huc illuc diffluebat;\" and among the miscellaneous\nmatters that oozed out, he must blab that he was entrusted with a letter\nto a townsman of theirs, one Gerard, a good fellow: he added \"you are\nall good fellows:\" and to impress his eulogy, slapped Sybrandt on the\nback so heartily, as to drive the breath out of his body.\n\nSybrandt got round the table to avoid this muscular approval; but\nlistened to every word, and learned for the first time that Gerard was\ngone to Italy. However, to make sure, he affected to doubt it.\n\n\"My brother Gerard is never in Italy.\"\n\n\"Ye lie, ye cur,\" roared Hans, taking instantly the irascible turn, and\nnot being clear enough to see that he, who now sat opposite him, was the\nsame he had praised, and hit, when beside him. \"If he is ten times\nyour brother, he is in Italy. What call ye this? There, read me that\nsuperscription!\" and he flung down a letter on the table.\n\nSybrandt took it up, and examined it gravely; but eventually laid it\ndown, with the remark, that he could not read. However, one of the\ncompany, by some immense fortuity, could read; and proud of so rare an\naccomplishment, took it, and read it out:\n\n\"To Gerard Eliassoen, of Tergou. These by the hand of the trusty Hans\nMemling, with all speed.\"\n\n\"'Tis excellently well writ,\" said the reader, examining every letter.\n\n\"Ay!\" said Hans bombastically, \"and small wonder: 'tis writ by a famous\nhand; by Margaret, sister of Jan Van Eyck. Blessed and honoured be his\nmemory! She is an old friend of mine, is Margaret Van Eyck.\"\n\nMiscellaneous Hans then diverged into forty topics.\n\nSybrandt stole out of the company, and went in search of Cornelis.\n\nThey put their heads together over the news: Italy was an immense\ndistance off. If they could only keep him there?\n\n\"Keep him there? Nothing would keep him long from his Margaret.\"\n\n\"Curse her!\" said Sybrandt. \"Why didn't she die when she was about it?\"\n\n\"She die? She would outlive the pest to vex us.\" And Cornelis was wroth\nat her selfishness in not dying, to oblige.\n\nThese two black sheep kept putting their heads together, and tainting\neach other worse and worse, till at last their corrupt hearts conceived\na plan for keeping Gerard in Italy all his life, and so securing his\nshare of their father's substance.\n\nBut when they had planned it they were no nearer the execution: for that\nrequired talent: so iniquity came to a standstill. But presently, as if\nSatan had come between the two heads, and whispered into the right ear\nof one and the left of the other simultaneously, they both burst out--\n\n\"THE BURGOMASTER!\"\n\n\nThey went to Ghysbrecht Van Swieten, and he received them at once:\nfor the man who is under the torture of suspense catches eagerly at\nknowledge. Certainty is often painful, but seldom, like suspense,\nintolerable.\n\n\"You have news of Gerard?\" said he eagerly.\n\nThen they told about the letter and Hans Memling. He listened with\nrestless eye. \"Who writ the letter?\"\n\n\"Margaret Van Eyck,\" was the reply; for they naturally thought the\ncontents were by the same hand as the superscription.\n\n\"Are ye sure?\" And he went to a drawer and drew out a paper written by\nMargaret Van Eyck while treating with the burgh for her house. \"Was it\nwrit like this?\"\n\n\"Yes. 'Tis the same writing,\" said Sybrandt boldly.\n\n\"Good. And now what would ye of me?\" said Ghysbrecht, with beating\nheart, but a carelessness so well feigned that it staggered them. They\nfumbled with their bonnets, and stammered and spoke a word or two, then\nhesitated and beat about the bush, and let out by degrees that they\nwanted a letter written, to say something that might keep Gerard in\nItaly; and this letter they proposed to substitute in Hans Memling's\nwallet for the one he carried. While these fumbled with their bonnets\nand their iniquity, and vacillated between respect for a burgomaster,\nand suspicion that this one was as great a rogue as themselves, and\nsomehow or other, on their side against Gerard, pros and cons were\ncoursing one another to and fro in the keen old man's spirit. Vengeance\nsaid let Gerard come back and feel the weight of the law. Prudence said\nkeep him a thousand miles off. But then Prudence said also, why do dirty\nwork on a doubtful chance? Why put it in the power of these two rogues\nto tarnish your name? Finally, his strong persuasion that Gerard was\nin possession of a secret by means of which he could wound him to the\nquick, coupled with his caution, found words thus: \"It is my duty to\naid the citizens that cannot write. But for their matter I will not be\nresponsible. Tell me, then, what I shall write.\"\n\n\"Something about this Margaret.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay! that she is false, that she is married to another, I'll go\nbail.\"\n\n\"Nay, burgomaster, nay! not for all the world!\" cried Sybrandt; \"Gerard\nwould not believe it, or but half, and then he would come back to see.\nNo; say that she is dead.\"\n\n\"Dead! what, at her age, will he credit that?\"\n\n\"Sooner than the other. Why she was nearly dead: so it is not to say a\ndownright lie, after all.\"\n\n\"Humph! And you think that will keep him in Italy?\"\n\n\"We are sure of it, are we not, Cornelis?\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said Cornelis, \"our Gerard will never leave Italy now he is\nthere. It was always his dream to get there. He would come back for\nhis Margaret, but not for us. What cares he for us? He despises his own\nfamily; always did.\"\n\n\"This would be a bitter pill to him,\" said the old hypocrite.\n\n\"It will be for his good in the end,\" replied the young one.\n\n\"What avails Famine wedding Thirst?\" said Cornelis.\n\n\"And the grief you are preparing for him so coolly?\" Ghysbrecht spoke\nsarcastically, but tasted his own vengeance all the time.\n\n\"Oh, a lie is not like a blow with a curtal axe. It hacks no flesh, and\nbreaks no bones.\"\n\n\"A curtal axe?\" said Sybrandt; \"no, nor even like a stroke with a\ncudgel.\" And he shot a sly envenomed glance at the burgomaster's broken\nnose.\n\nGhysbrecht's face darkened with ire when this adder's tongue struck his\nwound. But it told, as intended: the old man bristled with hate.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"tell me what to write for you, and I must write it;\nbut take notice, you bear the blame if aught turns amiss. Not the hand\nwhich writes, but the tongue which dictates, doth the deed.\"\n\nThe brothers assented warmly, sneering within. Ghysbrecht then drew\nhis inkhorn towards him, and laid the specimen of Margaret Van Eyck's\nwriting before him, and made some inquiries as to the size and shape\nof the letter, when an unlooked-for interruption occurred; Jorian Ketel\nburst hastily into the room, and looked vexed at not finding him alone.\n\n\"Thou seest I have matter on hand, good fellow.\"\n\n\"Ay; but this is grave. I bring good news; but 'tis not for every ear.\"\n\nThe burgomaster rose, and drew Jorian aside into the embrasure of his\ndeep window, and then the brothers heard them converse in low but eager\ntones. It ended by Ghysbrecht sending Jorian out to saddle his mule. He\nthen addressed the black sheep with a sudden coldness that amazed them--\n\n\"I prize the peace of households; but this is not a thing to be done in\na hurry: we will see about it, we will see.\"\n\n\"But, burgomaster, the man will be gone. It will be too late.\"\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"At the hostelry, drinking.\"\n\n\"Well, keep him drinking! We will see, we will see.\" And he sent them\noff discomfited.\n\nTo explain all this we must retrograde a step. This very morning then,\nMargaret Brandt had met Jorian Ketel near her own door. He passed her\nwith a scowl. This struck her, and she remembered him.\n\n\"Stay,\" said she. \"Yes! it is the good man who saved him. Oh! why\nhave you not been near me since? And why have you not come for the\nparchments? Was it not true about the hundred crowns?\"\n\nJorian gave a snort; but, seeing her face that looked so candid, began\nto think there might be some mistake. He told her he had come, and how\nhe had been received.\n\n\"Alas!\" said she, \"I knew nought of this. I lay at Death's door. She\nthen invited him to follow her, and took him into the garden and showed\nhim the spot where the parchments were buried. Martin was for taking\nthem up, but I would not let him. He put them there; and I said none\nshould move them but you, who had earned them so well of him and me.\"\n\n\"Give me a spade!\" cried Jorian eagerly. \"But stay! No; he is a\nsuspicious man. You are sure they are there still?\"\n\n\"I will openly take the blame if human hand hath touched them.\"\n\n\"Then keep them but two hours more, I prithee, good Margaret,\" said\nJorian, and ran off to the Stadthouse of Tergou a joyful man.\n\nThe burgomaster jogged along towards Sevenbergen, with Jorian striding\nbeside him, giving him assurance that in an hour's time the missing\nparchments would be in his hand.\n\n\"Ah, master!\" said he, \"lucky for us it wasn't a thief that took them.\"\n\n\"Not a thief? not a thief? what call you him, then?\"\n\n\"Well, saving your presence, I call him a jackdaw. This is jackdaw's\nwork, if ever there was; 'take the thing you are least in need of, and\nhide it'--that's a jackdaw. I should know,\" added Jorian oracularly,\n\"for I was brought up along with a chough. He and I were born the same\nyear, but he cut his teeth long before me, and wow! but my life was a\nburden for years all along of him. If you had but a hole in your hose no\nbigger than a groat, in went his beak like a gimlet; and, for stealing,\nGerard all over. What he wanted least, and any poor Christian in the\nhouse wanted most, that went first. Mother was a notable woman, so\nif she did but look round, away flew her thimble. Father lived by\ncordwaining, so about sunrise Jack went diligently off with his awl, his\nwax, and his twine. After that, make your bread how you could! One day\nI heard my mother tell him to his face he was enough to corrupt\nhalf-a-dozen other children; and he only cocked his eye at her, and next\nminute away with the nurseling's shoe off his very foot. Now this Gerard\nis tarred with the same stick. The parchments are no more use to him\nthan a thimble or an awl to Jack. He took 'em out of pure mischief and\nhid them, and you would never have found them but for me.\"\n\n\"I believe you are right,\" said Ghysbrecht, \"and I have vexed myself\nmore than need.\"\n\nWhen they came to Peter's gate he felt uneasy.\n\n\"I wish it had been anywhere but here.\"\n\nJorian reassured him.\n\n\"The girl is honest and friendly,\" said he. \"She had nothing to do with\ntaking them, I'll be sworn;\" and he led him into the garden. \"There,\nmaster, if a face is to be believed, here they lie; and see, the mould\nis loose.\"\n\nHe ran for a spade which was stuck up in the ground at some distance,\nand soon went to work and uncovered a parchment. Ghysbrecht saw it, and\nthrust him aside and went down on his knees and tore it out of the hole.\nHis hands trembled and his face shone. He threw out parchment after\nparchment, and Jorian dusted them and cleared them and shook them. Now,\nwhen Ghysbrecht had thrown out a great many, his face began to darken\nand lengthen, and when he came to the last, he put his hands to his\ntemples and seemed to be all amazed.\n\n\"What mystery lies here?\" he gasped. \"Are fiends mocking me? Dig deeper!\nThere must be another.\"\n\nJorian drove the spade in and threw out quantities of hard mould. In\nvain. And even while he dug, his master's mood had changed.\n\n\"Treason! treachery!\" he cried. \"You knew of this.\"\n\n\"Knew what, master, in Heaven's name?\"\n\n\"Caitiff, you knew there was another one worth all these twice told.'\n\n\"'Tis false,\" cried Jorian, made suspicious by the other's suspicion.\n\"'Tis a trick to rob me of my hundred crowns. Oh! I know you,\nburgomaster.\" And Jorian was ready to whimper.\n\nA mellow voice fell on them both like oil upon the waves.\n\n\"No, good man, it is not false, nor yet is it quite true: there was\nanother parchment.\"\n\n\"There, there, there! Where is it?\"\n\n\"But,\" continued Margaret calmly, \"it was not a town record (so you have\ngained your hundred crowns, good man): it was but a private deed between\nthe burgomaster here and my grandfather Flor--\"\n\n\"Hush, hush!\"\n\n\"--is Brandt.\"\n\n\"Where is it, girl? that is all we want to know.\"\n\n\"Have patience, and I shall tell you. Gerard read the title of it, and\nhe said, 'This is as much yours as the burgomaster's,' and he put it\napart, to read it with me at his leisure.\"\n\n\"It is in the house, then?\" said the burgomaster, recovering his\ncalmness.\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Margaret gravely, \"it is not.\" Then, in a voice\nthat faltered suddenly, \"You hunted--my poor Gerard--so hard--and so\nclose-that you gave him--no time-to think of aught--but his life--and\nhis grief. The parchment was in his bosom, and he hath ta'en it with\nhim.\"\n\n\"Whither, whither?\"\n\n\"Ask me no more, sir. What right is yours to question me thus? It was\nfor your sake, good man, I put force upon my heart, and came out here,\nand bore to speak at all to this hard old man. For, when I think of the\nmisery he has brought on him and me, the sight of him is more than I can\nbear;\" and she gave an involuntary shudder, and went slowly in, with her\nhand to her head, crying bitterly.\n\nRemorse for the past, and dread of the future--the slow, but, as he now\nfelt, the inevitable future--avarice, and fear, all tugged in one short\nmoment at Ghysbrecht's tough heart. He hung his head, and his arms fell\nlistless by his sides. A coarse chuckle made him start round, and there\nstood Martin Wittenhaagen leaning on his bow, and sneering from ear\nto ear. At sight of the man and his grinning face, Ghysbrecht's worst\npassions awoke.\n\n\"Ho! attach him, seize him, traitor and thief!\" cried he. \"Dog, thou\nshalt pay for all.\"\n\nMartin, without a word, calmly thrust the duke's pardon under\nGhysbrecht's nose. He looked, and had not a word to say. Martin followed\nup his advantage.\n\n\"The duke and I are soldiers. He won't let you greasy burghers trample\non an old comrade. He bade me carry you a message too.\"\n\n\"The duke send a message to me?\"\n\n\"Ay! I told him of your masterful doings, of your imprisoning Gerard\nfor loving a girl; and says he, 'Tell him this is to be a king, not\na burgomaster. I'll have no kings in Holland but one. Bid him be more\nhumble, or I'll hang him at his own door,'\"\n\n(Ghysbrecht trembled: he thought the duke capable of the deed)\n\n\"'as I hanged the burgomaster of Thingembob.' The duke could not mind\nwhich of you he had hung, or in what part; such trifles stick not in a\nsoldier's memory; but he was sure he had hanged one of you for grinding\npoor folk, 'and I'm the man to hang another,' quoth the good duke.\"\n\nThese repeated insults from so mean a man, coupled with his\ninvulnerability, shielded as he was by the duke, drove the choleric old\nman into a fit of impotent fury: he shook his fist at the soldier,\nand tried to threaten him, but could not speak for the rage and\nmortification that choked him: then he gave a sort of screech, and\ncoiled himself up in eye and form like a rattlesnake about to strike;\nand spat furiously upon Martin's doublet.\n\nThe thick-skinned soldier treated this ebullition with genuine contempt.\n\"Here's a venomous old toad! he knows a kick from his foot would send\nhim to his last home; and he wants me to cheat the gallows. But I have\nslain too many men in fair fight to lift limb against anything less than\na man; and this I count no man. What is it, in Heaven's name? an old\ngoat's-skin bag full o' rotten bones.\"\n\n\"My mule! my mule!\" screamed Ghysbrecht.\n\nJorian helped the old man up trembling in every joint. Once in the\nsaddle, he seemed to gather in a moment unnatural vigour; and the figure\nthat went flying to Tergou was truly weird-like and terrible: so old and\nwizened the face; so white and reverend the streaming hair; so baleful\nthe eye; so fierce the fury which shook the bent frame that went\nspurring like mad; while the quavering voice yelled, \"I'll make their\nhearts ache. I'll make their hearts ache. I'll make their hearts ache.\nI'll make their hearts ache. All of them. All!--all!--all!\"\n\n\nThe black sheep sat disconsolate amidst the convivial crew, and eyed\nHans Memling's wallet. For more ease he had taken it off, and flung it\non the table. How readily they could have slipped out that letter and\nput in another. For the first time in their lives they were sorry they\nhad not learned to write, like their brother.\n\nAnd now Hans began to talk of going, and the brothers agreed in a\nwhisper to abandon their project for the time. They had scarcely\nresolved this, when Dierich Brower stood suddenly in the doorway, and\ngave them a wink.\n\nThey went out to him. \"Come to the burgomaster with all speed,\" said he,\n\nThey found Ghysbrecht seated at a table, pale and agitated. Before him\nlay Margaret Van Eyck's handwriting. \"I have written what you desired,\"\nsaid he. \"Now for the superscription. What were the words? did ye see?\"\n\n\"We cannot read,\" said Cornelis.\n\n\"Then is all this labour lost,\" cried Ghysbrecht angrily. \"Dolts!\"\n\n\"Nay, but,\" said Sybrandt, \"I heard the words read, and I have not lost\nthem. They were, 'To Gerard Eliassoen, these by the hand of the trusty\nHans Memling, with all speed.'\"\n\n\"'Tis well. Now, how was the letter folded? how big was it?\"\n\n\"Longer than that one, and not so long as this.\"\n\n\"'Tis well. Where is he?\"\n\n\"At the hostelry.\"\n\n\"Come, then, take you this groat, and treat him. Then ask to see the\nletter, and put this in place of it. Come to me with the other letter.\"\n\nThe brothers assented, took the letter, and went to the hostelry.\n\nThey had not been gone a minute, when Dierich Brower issued from the\nStadthouse, and followed them. He had his orders not to let them out\nof his sight till the true letter was in his master's hands. He watched\noutside the hostelry.\n\nHe had not long to wait. They came out almost immediately, with downcast\nlooks. Dierich made up to them.\n\n\"Too late!\" they cried; \"too late! He is gone.\"\n\n\"Gone? How long?\"\n\n\"Scarce five minutes. Cursed chance!\"\n\n\"You must go back to the burgomaster at once,\" said Dierich Brower.\n\n\"To what end?\"\n\n\"No matter; come!\" and he hurried them to the Stadthouse.\n\nGhysbrecht Van Swieten was not the man to accept a defeat.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, on hearing the ill news, \"suppose he is gone. Is he\nmounted?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Then what hinders you to come up with him?\"\n\n\"But what avails coming up with him! There are no hostelries on the road\nhe is gone.\"\n\n\"Fools!\" said Ghysbrecht, \"is there no way of emptying a man's pockets\nbut liquor and sleight of hand?\"\n\nA meaning look, that passed between Ghysbrecht and Dierich, aided the\nbrothers' comprehension. They changed colour, and lost all zeal for the\nbusiness.\n\n\"No! no! we don't hate our brother. We won't get ourselves hanged to\nspite him,\" said Sybrandt; \"that would be a fool's trick.\"\n\n\"Hanged!\" cried Ghysbrecht. \"Am I not the burgomaster? How can ye be\nhanged? I see how 'tis ye fear to tackle one man, being two: hearts\nof hare, that ye are! Oh! why cannot I be young again? I'd do it\nsingle-handed.\"\n\nThe old man now threw off all disguise, and showed them his heart was in\nthis deed. He then flattered and besought, and jeered them alternately,\nbut he found no eloquence could move them to an action, however\ndishonourable, which was attended with danger. At last he opened a\ndrawer, and showed them a pile of silver coins.\n\n\"Change but those letters for me,\" he said, \"and each of you shall\nthrust one hand into this drawer, and take away as many of them as you\ncan hold.\"\n\nThe effect was magical. Their eyes glittered with desire. Their whole\nbodies seemed to swell, and rise into male energy.\n\n\"Swear it, then,\" said Sybrandt.\n\n\"I swear it.\"\n\n\"No; on the crucifix.\"\n\nGhysbrecht swore upon the crucifix.\n\nThe next minute the brothers were on the road, in pursuit of Hans\nMemling. They came in sight of him about two leagues from Tergou, but\nthough they knew he had no weapon but his staff, they were too prudent\nto venture on him in daylight; so they fell back.\n\nBut being now three leagues and more from the town, and on a grassy\nroad--sun down, moon not yet up--honest Hans suddenly found himself\nattacked before and behind at once by men with uplifted knives, who\ncried in loud though somewhat shaky voices, \"Stand and deliver!\"\n\nThe attack was so sudden, and so well planned, that Hans was dismayed.\n\"Slay me not, good fellows,\" he cried; \"I am but a poor man, and ye\nshall have my all.\"\n\n\"So be it then. Live! but empty thy wallet.\"\n\n\"There is nought in my wallet, good friend, but one letter.\"\n\n\"That we shall see,\" said Sybrandt, who was the one in front.\n\n\"Well, it is a letter.\"\n\n\"Take it not from me, I pray you. 'Tis worth nought, and the good dame\nwould fret that writ it.\"\n\n\"There,\" said Sybrandt, \"take back thy letter; and now empty thy pouch.\nCome I tarry not!\"\n\nBut by this time Hans had recovered his confusion; and from a certain\nflutter in Sybrandt, and hard breathing of Cornelis, aided by an\nindescribable consciousness, felt sure the pair he had to deal with were\nno heroes. He pretended to fumble for his money: then suddenly thrust\nhis staff fiercely into Sybrandt's face, and drove him staggering, and\nlent Cornelis a back-handed slash on the ear that sent him twirling like\na weathercock in March; then whirled his weapon over his head and danced\nabout the road like a figure on springs, shouting:\n\n\"Come on, ye thieving loons! Come on!\"\n\nIt was a plain invitation; yet they misunderstood it so utterly as to\ntake to their heels, with Hans after them, he shouting \"Stop thieves!\"\nand they howling with fear and pain as they ran.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\nDenys, placed in the middle of his companions, lest he should be so mad\nas attempt escape was carried off in an agony of grief and remorse. For\nhis sake Gerard had abandoned the German route to Rome; and what was his\nreward? left all alone in the centre of Burgundy. This was the thought\nwhich maddened Denys most, and made him now rave at heaven and earth,\nnow fall into a gloomy silence so savage and sinister that it was deemed\nprudent to disarm him. They caught up their leader just outside the\ntown, and the whole cavalcade drew up and baited at the \"Tete d'Or.\"\n\nThe young landlady, though much occupied with the count, and still\nmore with the bastard, caught sight of Denys, and asked him somewhat\nanxiously what had become of his young companion?\n\nDenys, with a burst of grief, told her all, and prayed her to send after\nGerard. \"Now he is parted from me, he will maybe listen to my rede,\"\nsaid he; \"poor wretch, he loves not solitude.\"\n\nThe landlady gave a toss of her head. \"I trow I have been somewhat\nover-kind already,\" said she, and turned rather red.\n\n\"You will not?\"\n\n\"Not I.\"\n\n\"Then,\"--and he poured a volley of curses and abuse upon her.\n\nShe turned her back upon him, and went off whimpering, and Saying she\nwas not used to be cursed at; and ordered her hind to saddle two mules.\n\nDenys went north with his troop, mute and drooping over his saddle,\nand quite unknown to him, that veracious young lady made an equestrian\ntoilet in only forty minutes, she being really in a hurry, and spurred\naway with her servant in the opposite direction.\n\nAt dark, after a long march, the bastard and his men reached \"The White\nHart;\" their arrival caused a prodigious bustle, and it was some time\nbefore Manon discovered her old friend among so many. When she did, she\nshowed it only by heightened colour. She did not claim the acquaintance.\nThe poor soul was already beginning to scorn.\n\n\"The base degrees by which she did ascend.\"\n\nDenys saw but could not smile. The inn reminded him too much of Gerard.\n\nEre the night closed the wind changed. She looked into the room and\nbeckoned him with her finger. He rose sulkily, and his guards with him.\n\n\"Nay, I would speak a word to thee in private.\"\n\nShe drew him to a corner of the room, and there asked him under her\nbreath would he do her a kindness.\n\nHe answered out loud, \"No, he would not; he was not in the vein to do\nkindnesses to man or woman. If he did a kindness it should be to a dog;\nand not that if he could help it.\"\n\n\"Alas, good archer, I did you one eftsoons, you and your pretty\ncomrade,\" said Manon humbly.\n\n\"You did, dame, you did; well then, for his sake--what is't to do?\"\n\n\"Thou knowest my story. I had been unfortunate. Now I am worshipful. But\na woman did cast him in my teeth this day. And so 'twill be ever while\nhe hangs there. I would have him ta'en down; well-a-day!\"\n\n\"With all my heart.\"\n\n\"And none dare I ask but thee. Wilt do't?\"\n\n\"Not I, even were I not a prisoner.\"\n\nOn this stern refusal the tender Manon sighed, and clasped her palms\ntogether despondently. Denys told her she need not fret. There were\nsoldiers of a lower stamp who would not make two bites of such a cherry.\nIt was a mere matter of money; if she could find two angels, he would\nfind two soldiers to do the dirty work of \"The White Hart.\"\n\nThis was not very palatable. However, reflecting that soldiers were\nbirds of passage, drinking here to-night, knocked on the head there\nto-morrow, she said softly, \"Send them out to me. But prithee, tell them\nthat 'tis for one that is my friend; let them not think 'tis for me; I\nshould sink into the earth; times are changed.\"\n\nDenys found warriors glad to win an angel apiece so easily. He sent them\nout, and instantly dismissing the subject with contempt, sat brooding on\nhis lost friend.\n\nManon and the warriors soon came to a general understanding. But what\nwere they to do with the body when taken down? She murmured, \"The river\nis nigh the--the place.\"\n\n\"Fling him in, eh?\"\n\n\"Nay, nay; be not so cruel! Could ye not put him--gently--and--with\nsomewhat weighty?\"\n\nShe must have been thinking on the subject in detail; for she was not\none to whom ideas came quickly.\n\nAll was speedily agreed, except the time of payment. The mail-clad\nitched for it, and sought it in advance. Manon demurred to that.\n\nWhat, did she doubt their word? then let her come along with them, or\nwatch them at a distance.\n\n\"Me?\" said Manon with horror. \"I would liever die than see it done.\"\n\n\"Which yet you would have done.\"\n\n\"Ay, for sore is my need. Times are changed.\"\n\nShe had already forgotten her precept to Denys.\n\nAn hour later the disagreeable relic of caterpillar existence ceased\nto canker the worshipful matron's public life, and the grim eyes of the\npast to cast malignant glances down into a white hind's clover field.\n\nTotal. She made the landlord an average wife, and a prime house-dog, and\noutlived everybody.\n\nHer troops, when they returned from executing with mediaeval naivete\nthe precept, \"Off wi' the auld love,\" received a shock. They found\nthe market-place black with groups; it had been empty an hour ago.\nConscience smote them. This came of meddling with the dead. However, the\nbolder of the two, encouraged by the darkness, stole forward alone, and\nslily mingled with a group: he soon returned to his companion, saying,\nin a tone of reproach not strictly reasonable,\n\n\"Ye born fool, it is only a miracle.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\nLetters of fire on the church wall had just inquired, with an appearance\nof genuine curiosity, why there was no mass for the duke in this time of\ntrouble. The supernatural expostulation had been seen by many, and had\ngradually faded, leaving the spectators glued there gaping. The upshot\nwas, that the corporation, not choosing to be behind the angelic powers\nin loyalty to a temporal sovereign, invested freely in masses. By this\nan old friend of ours, the cure, profited in hard cash; for which he had\na very pretty taste. But for this I would not of course have detained\nyou over so trite an occurrence as a miracle.\n\n\nDenys begged for his arms. \"Why disgrace him as well as break his\nheart?\"\n\n\"Then swear on the cross of thy sword not to leave the bastard's service\nuntil the sedition shall be put down.\" He yielded to necessity, and\ndelivered three volleys of oaths, and recovered his arms and liberty.\n\nThe troops halted at \"The Three Fish,\" and Marion at sight of him cried\nout, \"I'm out of luck; who would have thought to see you again?\" Then\nseeing he was sad, and rather hurt than amused at this blunt jest, she\nasked him what was amiss? He told her. She took a bright view of the\ncase. Gerard was too handsome and well-behaved to come to harm. The\nwomen too would always be on his side. Moreover, it was clear that\nthings must either go well or ill with him. In the former case he would\nstrike in with some good company going to Rome; in the latter he would\nreturn home, perhaps be there before his friend; \"for you have a trifle\nof fighting to do in Flanders by all accounts.\" She then brought him\nhis gold pieces, and steadily refused to accept one, though he urged her\nagain and again. Denys was somewhat convinced by her argument, because\nshe concurred with his own wishes, and was also cheered a little by\nfinding her so honest. It made him think a little better of that world\nin which his poor little friend was walking alone.\n\nFoot soldiers in small bodies down to twos and threes were already on\nthe road, making lazily towards Flanders, many of them penniless, but\npassed from town to town by the bailiffs, with orders for food and\nlodging on the innkeepers.\n\nAnthony of Burgundy overtook numbers of these, and gathered them under\nhis standard, so that he entered Flanders at the head of six hundred\nmen. On crossing the frontier he was met by his brother Baldwyn, with\nmen, arms, and provisions; he organized his whole force and marched on\nin battle array through several towns, not only without impediment,\nbut with great acclamations. This loyalty called forth comments not\naltogether gracious.\n\n\"This rebellion of ours is a bite,\" growled a soldier called Simon, who\nhad elected himself Denys's comrade.\n\nDenys said nothing, but made a little vow to St. Mars to shoot this\nAnthony of Burgundy dead, should the rebellion, that had cost him\nGerard, prove no rebellion.\n\nThat afternoon they came in sight of a strongly fortified town; and a\nwhisper went through the little army that this was a disaffected place.\n\nBut when they came in sight, the great gate stood open, and the towers\nthat flanked it on each side were manned with a single sentinel\napiece. So the advancing force somewhat broke their array and marched\ncarelessly.\n\nWhen they were within a furlong, the drawbridge across the moat rose\nslowly and creaking till it stood vertical against the fort and the\nvery moment it settled into this warlike attitude, down rattled the\nportcullis at the gate, and the towers and curtains bristled with lances\nand crossbows.\n\nA stern hum ran through the bastard's front rank and spread to the rear.\n\n\"Halt!\" cried he. The word went down the line, and they halted. \"Herald\nto the gate!\" A pursuivant spurred out of the ranks, and halting twenty\nyards from the gate, raised his bugle with his herald's flag hanging\ndown round it, and blew a summons. A tall figure in brazen armour\nappeared over the gate. A few fiery words passed between him and the\nherald, which were not audible, but their import clear, for the herald\nblew a single keen and threatening note at the walls, and came galloping\nback with war in his face. The bastard moved out of the line to meet\nhim, and their heads had not been together two seconds ere he turned in\nhis saddle and shouted, \"Pioneers, to the van!\" and in a moment hedges\nwere levelled, and the force took the field and encamped just out of\nshot from the walls; and away went mounted officers flying south, east,\nand west, to the friendly towns, for catapults, palisades, mantelets,\nraw hides, tar-barrels, carpenters, provisions, and all the materials\nfor a siege.\n\nThe bright perspective mightily cheered one drooping soldier. At\nthe first clang of the portcullis his eyes brightened and his temple\nflushed; and when the herald came back with battle in his eye he saw it\nin a moment, and for the first time this many days cried, \"Courage, tout\nle monde, le diable est mort.\"\n\nIf that great warrior heard, how he must have grinned!\n\nThe besiegers encamped a furlong from the walls, and made roads; kept\ntheir pikemen in camp ready for an assault when practicable; and sent\nforward their sappers, pioneers, catapultiers, and crossbowmen. These\nopened a siege by filling the moat, and mining, or breaching the wall,\netc. And as much of their work had to be done under close fire of\narrows, quarels, bolts, stones, and little rocks, the above artists \"had\nneed of a hundred eyes,\" and acted in concert with a vigilance, and an\namount of individual intelligence, daring, and skill, that made a siege\nvery interesting, and even amusing: to lookers on.\n\nThe first thing they did was to advance their carpenters behind rolling\nmantelets, to erect a stockade high and strong on the very edge of the\nmoat. Some lives were lost at this, but not many; for a strong force of\ncrossbowmen, including Denys, rolled their mantelets up and shot over\nthe workmen's heads at every besieged who showed his nose, and at every\nloophole, arrow-slit, or other aperture, which commanded the particular\nspot the carpenters happened to be upon. Covered by their condensed\nfire, these soon raised a high palisade between them and the ordinary\nmissiles from the pierced masonry.\n\nBut the besieged expected this, and ran out at night their boards or\nwooden penthouses on the top of the curtains. The curtains were built\nwith square holes near the top to receive the beams that supported these\nstructures, the true defence of mediaeval forts, from which the besieged\ndelivered their missiles with far more freedom and variety of range\nthan they could shoot through the oblique but immovable loopholes of the\ncurtain, or even through the sloping crenelets of the higher towers.\nOn this the besiegers brought up mangonels, and set them hurling\nhuge stones at these woodworks and battering them to pieces.\nContemporaneously they built a triangular wooden tower as high as the\ncurtain, and kept it ready for use, and just out of shot.\n\nThis was a terrible sight to the besieged. These wooden towers had taken\nmany a town. They began to mine underneath that part of the moat the\ntower stood frowning at; and made other preparations to give it a warm\nreception. The besiegers also mined, but at another part, their object\nbeing to get under the square barbican and throw it down. All this time\nDenys was behind his mantelet with another arbalestrier, protecting the\nworkmen and making some excellent shots. These ended by earning him\nthe esteem of an unseen archer, who every now and then sent a winged\ncompliment quivering into his mantelet. One came and struck within an\ninch of the narrow slit through which Denys was squinting at the moment.\n\"Peste,\" cried he, \"you shoot well, my friend. Come forth and receive my\ncongratulations! Shall merit such as thine hide its head? Comrade, it\nis one of those cursed Englishmen, with his half ell shaft. I'll not die\ntill I've had a shot at London wall.\"\n\nOn the side of the besieged was a figure that soon attracted great\nnotice by promenading under fire. It was a tall knight, clad in complete\nbrass, and carrying a light but prodigiously long lance, with which he\ndirected the movements of the besieged. And when any disaster befell the\nbesiegers, this tall knight and his long lance were pretty sure to be\nconcerned in it.\n\nMy young reader will say, \"Why did not Denys shoot him?\" Denys did shoot\nhim; every day of his life; other arbalestriers shot him; archers shot\nhim. Everybody shot him. He was there to be shot, apparently. But the\nabomination was, he did not mind being shot. Nay, worse, he got at last\nso demoralised as not to seem to know when he was shot. He walked his\nbattlements under fire, as some stout skipper paces his deck in a\nsuit of Flushing, calmly oblivious of the April drops that fall on his\nwoollen armour. At last the besiegers got spiteful, and would not waste\nany more good steel on him; but cursed him and his impervious coat of\nmail.\n\nHe took those missiles like the rest.\n\n\nGunpowder has spoiled war. War was always detrimental to the solid\ninterests of mankind. But in old times it was good for something: it\npainted well, sang divinely, furnished Iliads. But invisible butchery,\nunder a pall of smoke a furlong thick, who is any the better for that?\nPoet with his note-book may repeat, \"Suave etiam belli certamina magna\ntueri;\" but the sentiment is hollow and savours of cuckoo. You can't\ntueri anything but a horrid row. He didn't say, \"Suave etiam ingentem\ncaliginem tueri per campos instructam.\"\n\nThey managed better in the Middle Ages.\n\nThis siege was a small affair; but, such as it was, a writer or minstrel\ncould see it, and turn an honest penny by singing it; so far then the\nsport was reasonable, and served an end.\n\nIt was a bright day, clear, but not quite frosty. The efforts of the\nbesieging force were concentrated against a space of about two hundred\nand fifty yards, containing two curtains and two towers, one of which\nwas the square barbican, the other had a pointed roof that was built\nto overlap, resting on a stone machicolade, and by this means a row of\ndangerous crenelets between the roof and the masonry grinned down at the\nnearer assailants, and looked not very unlike the grinders of a modern\nfrigate with each port nearly closed. The curtains were overlapped with\npenthouses somewhat shattered by the mangonels, trebuchets, and other\nslinging engines of the besiegers. On the besiegers' edge of the moat\nwas what seemed at first sight a gigantic arsenal, longer than it was\nbroad, peopled by human ants, and full of busy, honest industry,\nand displaying all the various mechanical science of the age in full\noperation. Here the lever at work, there the winch and pulley, here the\nbalance, there the capstan. Everywhere heaps of stones, and piles of\nfascines, mantelets, and rows of fire-barrels. Mantelets rolling, the\nhammer tapping all day, horses and carts in endless succession rattling\nup with materials. Only, on looking closer into the hive of industry,\nyou might observe that arrows were constantly flying to and fro, that\nthe cranes did not tenderly deposit their masses of stone, but flung\nthem with an indifference to property, though on scientific principles,\nand that among the tubs full of arrows, and the tar-barrels and the\nbeams, the fagots, and other utensils, here and there a workman or a\nsoldier lay flatter than is usual in limited naps, and something more\nor less feathered stuck in them, and blood, and other essentials, oozed\nout.\n\nAt the edge of the moat opposite the wooden tower, a strong penthouse,\nwhich they called \"a cat,\" might be seen stealing towards the curtain,\nand gradually filling up the moat with fascines and rubbish, which the\nworkmen flung out at its mouth. It was advanced by two sets of ropes\npassing round pulleys, and each worked by a windlass at some distance\nfrom the cat. The knight burnt the first cat by flinging blazing\ntar-barrels on it. So the besiegers made the roof of this one very\nsteep, and covered it with raw hides, and the tar-barrels could not harm\nit. Then the knight made signs with his spear, and a little trebuchet\nbehind the walls began dropping stones just clear of the wall into the\nmoat, and at last they got the range, and a stone went clean through the\nroof of the cat, and made an ugly hole.\n\nBaldwyn of Burgundy saw this, and losing his temper, ordered the great\ncatapult that was battering the wood-work of the curtain opposite it to\nbe turned and levelled slantwise at this invulnerable knight. Denys and\nhis Englishman went to dinner. These two worthies being eternally on\nthe watch for one another had made a sort of distant acquaintance, and\nconversed by signs, especially on a topic that in peace or war maintains\nthe same importance. Sometimes Denys would put a piece of bread on the\ntop of his mantelet, and then the archer would hang something of the\nkind out by a string; or the order of invitation would be reversed.\nAnyway, they always managed to dine together.\n\nAnd now the engineers proceeded to the unusual step of slinging\nfifty-pound stones at an individual.\n\nThis catapult was a scientific, simple, and beautiful engine, and very\neffective in vertical fire at the short ranges of the period.\n\nImagine a fir-tree cut down, and set to turn round a horizontal axis on\nlofty uprights, but not in equilibrio; three-fourths of the tree being\non the hither side. At the shorter and thicker end of the tree was\nfastened a weight of half a ton. This butt end just before the discharge\npointed towards the enemy. By means of a powerful winch the long\ntapering portion of the tree was forced down to the very ground, and\nfastened by a bolt; and the stone placed in a sling attached to the\ntree's nose. But this process of course raised the butt end with its\nhuge weight high in the air, and kept it there struggling in vain\nto come down. The bolt was now drawn; Gravity, an institution which\nflourished even then, resumed its sway, the short end swung furiously\ndown, the long end went as furiously round up, and at its highest\nelevation flung the huge stone out of the sling with a tremendous jerk.\nIn this case the huge mass so flung missed the knight; but came down\nnear him on the penthouse, and went through it like paper, making an\nawful gap in roof and floor. Through the latter fell out two inanimate\nobjects, the stone itself and the mangled body of a besieger it had\nstruck. They fell down the high curtain side, down, down, and struck\nalmost together the sullen waters of the moat, which closed bubbling\non them, and kept both the stone and the bone two hundred years, till\ncannon mocked those oft perturbed waters, and civilization dried them.\n\n\"Aha! a good shot,\" cried Baldwyn of Burgundy.\n\nThe tall knight retired. The besiegers hooted him.\n\nHe reappeared on the platform of the barbican, his helmet being just\nvisible above the parapet. He seemed very busy, and soon an enormous\nTurkish catapult made its appearance on the platform and aided by the\nelevation at which it was planted, flung a twentypound stone some two\nhundred and forty yards in the air; it bounded after that, and knocked\nsome dirt into the Lord Anthony's eye, and made him swear. The next\nstone struck a horse that was bringing up a sheaf of arrows in a cart,\nbowled the horse over dead like a rabbit, and spilt the cart. It was\nthen turned at the besiegers' wooden tower, supposed to be out of shot.\nSir Turk slung stones cut with sharp edges on purpose, and struck it\nrepeatedly, and broke it in several places. The besiegers turned two\nof their slinging engines on this monster, and kept constantly slinging\nsmaller stones on to the platform of the barbican, and killed two of\nthe engineers. But the Turk disdained to retort. He flung a forty-pound\nstone on to the besiegers' great catapult, and hitting it in the\nneighbourhood of the axis, knocked the whole structure to pieces, and\nsent the engineers skipping and yelling.\n\nIn the afternoon, as Simon was running back to his mantelet from a\npalisade where he had been shooting at the besieged, Denys, peeping\nthrough his slit, saw the poor fellow suddenly stare and hold out his\narms, then roll on his face, and a feathered arrow protruded from his\nback. The archer showed himself a moment to enjoy his skill. It was the\nEnglishman. Denys, already prepared, shot his bolt, and the murderous\narcher staggered away wounded. But poor Simon never moved. His wars were\nover.\n\n\"I am unlucky in my comrades,\" said Denys.\n\nThe next morning an unwelcome sight greeted the besieged. The cat was\ncovered with mattresses and raw hides, and fast filling up the moat. The\nknight stoned it, but in vain; flung burning tar-barrels on it, but in\nvain. Then with his own hands he let down by a rope a bag of burning\nsulphur and pitch, and stunk them out. But Baldwyn, armed like a\nlobster, ran, and bounding on the roof, cut the string, and the work\nwent on. Then the knight sent fresh engineers into the mine, and\nundermined the place and underpinned it with beams, and covered the\nbeams thickly with grease and tar.\n\nAt break of day the moat was filled, and the wooden tower began to move\non its wheels towards a part of the curtain on which two catapults\nwere already playing to breach the hoards, and clear the way. There was\nsomething awful and magical in its approach without visible agency, for\nit was driven by internal rollers worked by leverage. On the top was a\nplatform, where stood the first assailing party protected in front by\nthe drawbridge of the turret, which stood vertical till lowered on to\nthe wall; but better protected by full suits of armour. The beseiged\nslung at the tower, and struck it often, but in vain. It was well\ndefended with mattresses and hides, and presently was at the edge of the\nmoat. The knight bade fire the mine underneath it.\n\nThen the Turkish engine flung a stone of half a hundredweight right\namongst the knights, and carried two away with it off the tower on to\nthe plain. One lay and writhed: the other neither moved nor spake.\n\nAnd now the besieging catapults flung blazing tar-barrels, and fired the\nhoards on both sides, and the assailants ran up the ladders behind the\ntower, and lowered the drawbridge on to the battered curtain, while the\ncatapults in concert flung tar-barrels and fired the adjoining works\nto dislodge the defenders. The armed men on the platform sprang on the\nbridge, led by Baldwyn. The invulnerable knight and his men-at-arms met\nthem, and a fearful combat ensued, in which many a figure was seen\nto fall headlong down off the narrow bridge. But fresh besiegers kept\nswarming up behind the tower, and the besieged were driven off the\nbridge.\n\nAnother minute, and the town was taken; but so well had the firing of\nthe mine been timed, that just at this instant the underpinners gave\nway, and the tower suddenly sank away from the walls, tearing the\ndrawbridge clear and pouring the soldiers off it against the masonry,\nand on to the dry moat. The besieged uttered a fierce shout, and in a\nmoment surrounded Baldwyn and his fellows; but strange to say, offered\nthem quarter. While a party disarmed and disposed of these, others fired\nthe turret in fifty places with a sort of hand grenades. At this work\nwho so busy as the tall knight. He put the fire-bags on his long spear,\nand thrust them into the doomed structure late so terrible. To do this\nhe was obliged to stand on a projecting beam of the shattered hoard,\nholding on by the hand of a pikeman to steady himself. This provoked\nDenys; he ran out from his mantelet, hoping to escape notice in the\nconfusion, and levelling his crossbow missed the knight clean, but sent\nhis bolt into the brain of the pikeman, and the tall knight fell heavily\nfrom the wall, lance and all. Denys gazed wonder-struck; and in that\nunlucky moment, suddenly he felt his arm hot, then cold, and there was\nan English arrow skewering it.\n\nThis episode was unnoticed in a much greater matter. The knight, his\narmour glittering in the morning sun, fell headlong, but turning as he\nneared the water, struck it with a slap that sounded a mile off.\n\nNone ever thought to see him again. But he fell at the edge of the\nfascines on which the turret stood all cocked on one side, and his spear\nstuck into them under water, and by a mighty effort he got to the side,\nbut could not get out. Anthony sent a dozen knights with a white flag to\ntake him prisoner. He submitted like a lamb, but said nothing.\n\nHe was taken to Anthony's tent.\n\nThat worthy laughed at first at the sight of his muddy armour, but\npresently, frowning, said, \"I marvel, sir, that so good a knight as\nyou should know his devoir so ill as turn rebel, and give us all this\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"I am nun-nun-nun-nun-nun-no knight.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"A hosier.\"\n\n\"A what? Then thy armour shall be stripped off, and thou shalt be tied\nto a stake in front of the works, and riddled with arrows for a warning\nto traitors.\"\n\n\"N-n-n-n-no! duda-duda-duda-duda-don't do that.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Tuta-tuta-tuta-townsfolk will-h-h-h-hang t'other\nbuba-buba-buba-buba-bastard.\"\n\n\"What, whom?\"\n\n\"Your bub-bub-bub-brother Baldwyn.\"\n\n\"What, have you knaves ta'en him?\"\n\nThe warlike hosier nodded.\n\n\"Hang the fool!\" said Anthony, peevishly.\n\nThe warlike hosier watched his eye, and doffing his helmet, took out of\nthe lining an intercepted letter from the duke, bidding the said Anthony\ncome to court immediately, as he was to represent the court of Burgundy\nat the court of England; was to go over and receive the English king's\nsister, and conduct her to her bridegroom, the Earl of Charolois. The\nmission was one very soothing to Anthony's pride, and also to his love\nof pleasure. For Edward the Fourth held the gayest and most luxurious\ncourt in Europe. The sly hosier saw he longed to be off, and said,\n\"We'll gega-gega-gega-gega-give ye a thousand angels to raise the\nsiege.\"\n\n\"And Baldwyn?\"\n\n\"I'll gega-gega-gega-gega-go and send him with the money.\"\n\nIt was now dinner-time; and a flag of truce being hoisted on both sides,\nthe sham knight and the true one dined together and came to a friendly\nunderstanding.\n\n\"But what is your grievance, my good friend?\"\n\n\"Tuta-tuta-tuta-tuta-too much taxes.\"\n\nDenys, on finding the arrow in his right arm, turned his back, which was\nprotected by a long shield, and walked sulkily into camp. He was met by\nthe Comte de Jarnac, who had seen his brilliant shot, and finding him\nwounded into the bargain, gave him a handful of broad pieces.\n\n\"Hast got the better of thy grief, arbalestrier, methinks.\"\n\n\"My grief, yes; but not my love. As soon as ever I have put down this\nrebellion, I go to Holland, and there I shall meet with him.\"\n\nThis event was nearer than Denys thought. He was relieved from service\nnext day, and though his wound was no trifle, set out with a stout heart\nto rejoin his friend in Holland.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII\n\nA change came over Margaret Brandt. She went about her household duties\nlike one in a dream. If Peter did but speak a little quickly to her, she\nstarted and fixed two terrified eyes on him. She went less often to her\nfriend Margaret Van Eyck, and was ill at her ease when there. Instead of\nmeeting her warm old friend's caresses, she used to receive them passive\nand trembling, and sometimes almost shrink from them. But the most\nextraordinary thing was, she never would go outside her own house in\ndaylight. When she went to Tergou it was after dusk, and she returned\nbefore daybreak. She would not even go to matins. At last Peter,\nunobservant as he was, noticed it, and asked her the reason.\n\n\"Methinks the folk all look at me.\"\n\nOne day, Margaret Van Eyck asked her what was the matter.\n\nA scared look and a flood of tears were all the reply; the old lady\nexpostulated gently. \"What, sweetheart, afraid to confide your sorrows\nto me?\"\n\n\"I have no sorrows, madam, but of my own making. I am kinder treated\nthan I deserve; especially in this house.\"\n\n\"Then why not come oftener, my dear?\"\n\n\"I come oftener than I deserve;\" and she sighed deeply.\n\n\"There, Reicht is bawling for you,\" said Margaret Van Eyck; \"go,\nchild!--what on earth can it be?\"\n\nTurning possibilities over in her mind, she thought Margaret must be\nmortified at the contempt with which she was treated by Gerard's family.\n\"I will take them to task for it, at least such of them as are women;\"\nand the very next day she put on her hood and cloak and followed by\nReicht, went to the hosier's house. Catherine received her with much\nrespect, and thanked her with tears for her kindness to Gerard. But\nwhen, encouraged by this, her visitor diverged to Margaret Brandt,\nCatherine's eyes dried, and her lips turned to half the size, and she\nlooked as only obstinate, ignorant women can look. When they put on\nthis cast of features, you might as well attempt to soften or convince a\nbrick wall. Margaret Van Eyck tried, but all in vain. So then, not being\nherself used to be thwarted, she got provoked, and at last went out\nhastily with an abrupt and mutilated curtsey, which Catherine, returned\nwith an air rather of defiance than obeisance. Outside the door Margaret\nVan Eyck found Reicht conversing with a pale girl on crutches. Margaret\nVan Eyck was pushing by them with heightened colour, and a scornful\ntoss intended for the whole family, when suddenly a little delicate hand\nglided timidly into hers, and looking round she saw two dove-like eyes,\nwith the water in them, that sought hers gratefully and at the same time\nimploringly. The old lady read this wonderful look, complex as it was,\nand down went her choler. She stopped and kissed Kate's brow. \"I see,\"\nsaid she. \"Mind, then, I leave it to you.\" Returned home, she said--\"I\nhave been to a house to-day, where I have seen a very common thing and\na very uncommon thing; I have seen a stupid, obstinate woman, and I have\nseen an angel in the flesh, with a face-if I had it here I'd take down\nmy brushes once more and try and paint it.\"\n\nLittle Kate did not belie the good opinion so hastily formed of her. She\nwaited a better opportunity, and told her mother what she had learned\nfrom Reicht Heynes, that Margaret had shed her very blood for Gerard in\nthe wood.\n\n\"See, mother, how she loves him.\"\n\n\"Who would not love him?\"\n\n\"Oh, mother, think of it! Poor thing.\"\n\n\"Ay, wench. She has her own trouble, no doubt, as well as we ours. I\ncan't abide the sight of blood, let alone my own.\"\n\nThis was a point gained; but when Kate tried to follow it up she was\nstopped short.\n\nAbout a month after this a soldier of the Dalgetty tribe, returning from\nservice in Burgundy, brought a letter one evening to the hosier's house.\nHe was away on business; but the rest of the family sat at Supper. The\nsoldier laid the letter on the table by Catherine, and refusing all\nguerdon for bringing it, went off to Sevenbergen.\n\nThe letter was unfolded and spread out; and curiously enough, though not\none of them could read, they could all tell it was Gerard's handwriting.\n\n\"And your father must be away,\" cried Catherine. \"Are ye not ashamed of\nyourselves? not one that can read your brother's letter.\"\n\nBut although the words were to them what hieroglyphics are to us, there\nwas something in the letter they could read. There is an art can speak\nwithout words; unfettered by the penman's limits, it can steal through\nthe eye into the heart and brain, alike of the learned and unlearned;\nand it can cross a frontier or a sea, yet lose nothing. It is at the\nmercy of no translator; for it writes an universal language.\n\nWhen, therefore, they saw this,\n\n[a picture of two hands clasped together]\n\nwhich Gerard had drawn with his pencil between the two short paragraphs,\nof which his letter consisted, they read it, and it went straight to\ntheir hearts.\n\nGerard was bidding them farewell.\n\nAs they gazed on that simple sketch, in every turn and line of which\nthey recognized his manner, Gerard seemed present, and bidding them\nfarewell.\n\nThe women wept over it till they could see it no longer.\n\nGiles said, \"Poor Gerard!\" in a lower voice than seemed to belong to\nhim.\n\nEven Cornelis and Sybrandt felt a momentary remorse, and sat silent and\ngloomy.\n\nBut how to get the words read to them. They were loth to show their\nignorance and their emotion to a stranger.\n\n\"The Dame Van Eyck?\" said Kate timidly.\n\n\"And so I will, Kate. She has a good heart. She loves Gerard, too. She\nwill be glad to hear of him. I was short with her when she came here;\nbut I will make my submission, and then she will tell me what my poor\nchild says to me.\"\n\nShe was soon at Margaret Van Eyck's house. Reicht took her into a room,\nand said, \"Bide a minute; she is at her orisons.\"\n\nThere was a young woman in the room seated pensively by the stove; but\nshe rose and courteously made way for the visitor.\n\n\"Thank you, young lady; the winter nights are cold, and your stove is a\ntreat.\" Catherine then, while warming her hands, inspected her companion\nfurtively from head to foot, inclusive. The young person wore an\nordinary wimple, but her gown was trimmed with fur, which was, in those\ndays, almost a sign of superior rank or wealth. But what most struck\nCatherine was the candour and modesty of the face. She felt sure of\nsympathy from so good a countenance, and began to gossip.\n\n\"Now, what think you brings me here, young lady? It is a letter! a\nletter from my poor boy that is far away in some savage part or other.\nAnd I take shame to say that none of us can read it. I wonder whether\nyou can read?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Can ye, now? It is much to your credit, my dear. I dare say she won't\nbe long; but every minute is an hour to a poor longing mother.\"\n\n\"I will read it to you.\"\n\n\"Bless you, my dear; bless you!\"\n\nIn her unfeigned eagerness she never noticed the suppressed eagerness\nwith which the hand was slowly put out to take the letter. She did not\nsee the tremor with which the fingers closed on it.\n\n\"Come, then, read it to me, prithee. I am wearying for it.\"\n\n\"The first words are, 'To my honoured parents.'\"\n\n\"Ay! and he always did honour us, poor soul.\"\n\n\"'God and the saints have you in His holy keeping, and bless you by\nnight and by day. Your one harsh deed is forgotten; your years of love\nremembered.'\"\n\nCatherine laid her hand on her bosom, and sank back in her chair with\none long sob.\n\n\"Then comes this, madam. It doth speak for itself; 'a long farewell.'\"\n\n\"Ay, go on; bless you, girl you give me sorry comfort. Still 'tis\ncomfort.\"\n\n\"'To my brothers Cornelis and Sybrandt--Be content; you will see me no\nmore!'\"\n\n\"What does that mean? Ah!\"\n\n\"'To my sister Kate. Little angel of my father's house. Be kind to\nher--' Ah!\"\n\n\"That is Margaret Brandt, my dear--his sweetheart, poor soul. I've not\nbeen kind to her, my dear. Forgive me, Gerard!\"\n\n\"'--for poor Gerard's sake: since grief to her is death to me--Ah!\"\nAnd nature, resenting the poor girl's struggle for unnatural composure,\nsuddenly gave way, and she sank from her chair and lay insensible, with\nthe letter in her hand and her head on Catherine's knees.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV\n\nExperienced women are not frightened when a woman faints, or do they\nhastily attribute it to anything but physical causes, which they have\noften seen produce it. Catherine bustled about; laid the girl down with\nher head on the floor quite flat, opened the window, and unloosed her\ndress as she lay. Not till she had done all this did she step to the\ndoor and say, rather loudly:\n\n\"Come here, if you please.\"\n\nMargaret Van Eyck and Reicht came, and found Margaret lying quite flat,\nand Catherine beating her hands.\n\n\"Oh, my poor girl! What have you done to her?\"\n\n\"Me?\" said Catherine angrily.\n\n\"What has happened, then?\"\n\n\"Nothing, madam; nothing more than is natural in her situation.\"\n\nMargaret Van Eyck coloured with ire.\n\n\"You do well to speak so coolly,\" said she, \"you that are the cause of\nher situation.\"\n\n\"That I am not,\" said Catherine bluntly; \"nor any woman born.\"\n\n\"What! was it not you and your husband that kept them apart? and now he\nhas gone to Italy all alone. Situation indeed! You have broken her heart\namongst you.\"\n\n\"Why, madam? Who is it then? in Heaven's name! To hear you, one would\nthink this was my Gerard's lass. But that can't be. This fur never cost\nless than five crowns the ell; besides, this young gentlewoman is a\nwife; or ought to be.\"\n\n\"Of course she ought. And who is the cause she is none? Who came before\nthem at the very altar?\"\n\n\"God forgive them, whoever it was,\" said Catherine gravely; \"me it was\nnot, nor my man.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the other, a little softened, \"now you have seen her,\nperhaps you will not be quite so bitter against her madam. She is coming\nto, thank Heaven.\"\n\n\"Me bitter against her?\" said Catherine; \"no, that is all over. Poor\nsoul! trouble behind her and trouble afore her; and to think of my\nsetting her, of all living women, to read Gerard's letter to me. Ay, and\nthat was what made her go off, I'll be sworn. She is coming to. What,\nsweetheart! be not afeard, none are here but friends.\"\n\nThey seated her in an easy chair. As the colour was creeping back to her\nface and lips. Catherine drew Margaret Van Eyck aside.\n\n\"Is she staying with you, if you please?\"\n\n\"No, madam.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't let her go back to Sevenbergen to-night, then.\"\n\n\"That is as she pleases. She still refuses to bide the night.\"\n\n\"Ay, but you are older than she is; you can make her. There, she is\nbeginning to notice.\"\n\nCatherine then put her mouth to Margaret Van Eyck's ear for half a\nmoment; it did not seem time enough to whisper a word, far less a\nsentence. But on some topics females can flash communication to female\nlike lightning, or thought itself.\n\nThe old lady started, and whispered back--\n\n\"It's false! it is a calumny! it is monstrous! look at her face. It is\nblasphemy to accuse such a face.\"\n\n\"Tut! tut! tut!\" said the other; \"you might as well say this is not my\nhand. I ought to know; and I tell ye it is so.\"\n\nThen, much to Margaret Van Eyck's surprise, she went up to the girl, and\ntaking her round the neck, kissed her warmly.\n\n\"I suffered for Gerard, and you shed your blood for him I do hear; his\nown words show me that I have been to blame, the very words you have\nread to me. Ay, Gerard, my child, I have held aloof from her; but I'll\nmake it up to her once I begin. You are my daughter from this hour.\"\n\nAnother warm embrace sealed this hasty compact, and the woman of impulse\nwas gone.\n\nMargaret lay back in her chair, and a feeble smile stole over her face.\nGerard's mother had kissed her and called her daughter; but the next\nmoment she saw her old friend looking at her with a vexed air.\n\n\"I wonder you let that woman kiss you.\"\n\n\"His mother!\" murmured Margaret, half reproachfully.\n\n\"Mother, or no mother, you would not let her touch you if you knew what\nshe whispered in my ear about you.\"\n\n\"About me?\" said Margaret faintly.\n\n\"Ay, about you, whom she never saw till to-night.\" The old lady was\nproceeding, with some hesitation and choice of language, to make\nMargaret share her indignation, when an unlooked-for interruption closed\nher lips.\n\nThe young woman slid from her chair to her knees, and began to pray\npiteously to her for pardon. From the words and the manner of her\npenitence a bystander would have gathered she had inflicted some cruel\nwrong, some intolerable insult, upon her venerable friend.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV\n\nThe little party at the hosier's house sat at table discussing the\nrecent event, when their mother returned, and casting a piercing glance\nall round the little circle, laid the letter flat on the table. She\nrepeated every word of it by memory, following the lines with her\nfinger, to cheat herself and bearers into the notion that she could read\nthe words, or nearly. Then, suddenly lifting her head, she cast another\nkeen look on Cornelis and Sybrandt: their eyes fell.\n\nOn this the storm that had long been brewing burst on their heads.\n\nCatherine seemed to swell like an angry hen ruffling her feathers, and\nout of her mouth came a Rhone and Saone of wisdom and twaddle, of great\nand mean invective, such as no male that ever was born could utter in\none current; and not many women.\n\nThe following is a fair though a small sample of her words: only they\nwere uttered all in one breath.\n\n\"I have long had my doubts that you blew the flame betwixt Gerard and\nyour father, and set that old rogue, Ghysbrecht, on. And now, here are\nGerard's own written words to prove it. You have driven your own flesh\nand blood into a far land, and robbed the mother that bore you of her\ndarling, the pride of her eye, the joy of her heart. But you are all of\na piece from end to end. When you were all boys together, my others were\na comfort; but you were a curse: mischievous and sly; and took a woman\nhalf a day to keep your clothes whole: for why? work wears cloth, but\nplay cuts it. With the beard comes prudence; but none came to you:\nstill the last to go to bed, and the last to leave it; and why? because\nhonesty goes to bed early, and industry rises betimes; where there are\ntwo lie-a-beds in a house there are a pair of ne'er-do-weels. Often I've\nsat and looked at your ways, and wondered where ye came from: ye don't\ntake after your father, and ye are no more like me than a wasp is to an\nant; sure ye were changed in the cradle, or the cuckoo dropped ye on my\nfloor: for ye have not our hands, nor our hearts: of all my blood, none\nbut you ever jeered them that God afflicted; but often when my back was\nturned I've heard you mock at Giles, because he is not as big as some;\nand at my lily Kate, because she is not so strong as a Flanders mare.\nAfter that rob a church an you will! for you can be no worse in His eyes\nthat made both Kate and Giles, and in mine that suffered for them, poor\ndarlings, as I did for you, you paltry, unfeeling, treasonable curs!\nNo, I will not hush, my daughter, they have filled the cup too full. It\ntakes a deal to turn a mother's heart against the sons she has nursed\nupon her knees; and many is the time I have winked and wouldn't see too\nmuch, and bitten my tongue, lest their father should know them as I do;\nhe would have put them to the door that moment. But now they have filled\nthe cup too full. And where got ye all this money? For this last month\nyou have been rolling in it. You never wrought for it. I wish I may\nnever hear from other mouths how ye got it. It is since that night you\nwere out so late, and your head came back so swelled, Cornelis. Sloth\nand greed are ill-mated, my masters. Lovers of money must sweat or\nsteal. Well, if you robbed any poor soul of it, it was some woman, I'll\ngo bail; for a man would drive you with his naked hand. No matter, it is\ngood for one thing. It has shown me how you will guide our gear if ever\nit comes to be yourn. I have watched you, my lads, this while. You have\nspent a groat to-day between you. And I spend scarce a groat a week, and\nkeep you all, good and bad. No I give up waiting for the shoes that will\nmaybe walk behind your coffin; for this shop and this house shall never\nbe yourn. Gerard is our heir; poor Gerard, whom you have banished and\ndone your best to kill; after that never call me mother again! But you\nhave made him tenfold dearer to me. My poor lost boy! I shall soon see\nhim again shall hold him in my arms, and set him on my knees. Ay, you\nmay stare! You are too crafty, and yet not crafty enow. You cut the\nstalk away; but you left the seed--the seed that shall outgrow you, and\noutlive you. Margaret Brandt is quick, and it is Gerard's, and what is\nGerard's is mine; and I have prayed the saints it may be a boy; and it\nwill--it must. Kate, when I found it was so, my bowels yearned over her\nchild unborn as if it had been my own. He is our heir. He will outlive\nus. You will not; for a bad heart in a carcass is like the worm in the\nnut, soon brings the body to dust. So, Kate, take down Gerard's bib and\ntucker that are in the drawer you wot of, and one of these days we will\ncarry them to Sevenbergen. We will borrow Peter Buyskens' cart, and\ngo comfort Gerard's wife under her burden. She is his wife. Who is\nGhysbrecht Van Swieten? Can he come between a couple and the altar, and\nsunder those that God and the priest make one? She is my daughter, and\nI am as proud of her as I am of you, Kate, almost; and as for you, keep\nout of my way awhile, for you are like the black dog in my eyes.\"\n\nCornelis and Sybrandt took the hint and slunk out, aching with remorse,\nand impenitence, and hate. They avoided her eye as much as ever\nthey could; and for many days she never spoke a word, good, bad, or\nindifferent, to either of them. Liberaverat animum suum.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI\n\nCatherine was a good housewife who seldom left home for a day, and then\none thing or another always went amiss. She was keenly conscious of\nthis, and watching for a slack tide in things domestic, put off her\nvisit to Sevenbergen from day to day, and one afternoon that it really\ncould have been managed, Peter Buyskens' mule was out of the way.\n\nAt last, one day Eli asked her before all the family, whether it was\ntrue she had thought of visiting Margaret Brandt.\n\n\"Ay, my man.\"\n\n\"Then I do forbid you.\"\n\n\"Oh, do you?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Then there is no more to be said, I suppose,\" said she, colouring.\n\n\"Not a word,\" replied Eli sternly.\n\nWhen she was alone with her daughter she was very severe, not upon Eli,\nbut upon herself.\n\n\"Behoved me rather go thither like a cat at a robin. But this was me all\nover. I am like a silly hen that can lay no egg without cackling, and\nconvening all the house to rob her on't. Next time you and I are after\naught the least amiss, let's do't in Heaven's name then and there, and\nnot take time to think about it, far less talk; so then, if they take us\nto task we can say, alack we knew nought; we thought no ill; now, who'd\never? and so forth. For two pins I'd go thither in all their teeth.\"\n\nDefiance so wild and picturesque staggered Kate. \"Nay, mother, with\npatience father will come round.\"\n\n\"And so will Michaelmas; but when? and I was so bent on you seeing the\ngirl. Then we could have put our heads together about her. Say what they\nwill, there is no judging body or beast but by the eye. And were I to\nhave fifty more sons I'd ne'er thwart one of them's fancy, till such\ntime as I had clapped my eyes upon her and seen Quicksands; say you,\nI should have thought of that before condemning Gerard his fancy; but\nthere, life is a school, and the lesson ne'er done; we put down one\nfault and take up t'other, and so go blundering here, and blundering\nthere, till we blunder into our graves, and there's an end of us.\"\n\n\"Mother,\" said Kate timidly.\n\n\"Well, what is a-coming now? no good news though, by the look of you.\nWhat on earth can make the poor wretch so scared?\"\n\n\"An avowal she hath to make,\" faltered Kate faintly.\n\n\"Now, there is a noble word for ye,\" said Catherine proudly. \"Our Gerard\ntaught thee that, I'll go bail. Come then, out with thy vowel.\"\n\n\"Well then, sooth to say, I have seen her.\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"And spoken with her to boot.\"\n\n\"And never told me? After this marvels are dirt.\"\n\n\"Mother, you were so hot against her. I waited till I could tell you\nwithout angering you worse.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said Catherine, half sadly, half bitterly, \"like mother, like\ndaughter; cowardice it is our bane. The others I whiles buffet, or how\nwould the house fare? but did you, Kate, ever have harsh word or look\nfrom your poor mother, that you--Nay, I will not have ye cry, girl; ten\nto one ye had your reason; so rise up, brave heart, and tell me all,\nbetter late than ne'er; and first and foremost when ever, and how ever,\nwend you to Sevenbergen wi' your poor crutches, and I not know?\"\n\n\"I never was there in my life; and, mammy dear, to say that I ne'er\nwished to see her that I will not, but I ne'er went nor sought to see\nher.\"\n\n\"There now,\" said Catherine disputatively, \"said I not 'twas all unlike\nmy girl to seek her unbeknown to me? Come now, for I'm all agog.\n\n\"Then thus 'twas. It came to my ears, no matter how, and prithee, good\nmother, on my knees ne'er ask me how, that Gerard was a prisoner in the\nStadthouse tower.\"\n\n\"Ah\"\n\n\"By father's behest as 'twas pretended.\"\n\nCatherine uttered a sigh that was almost a moan. \"Blacker than I\nthought,\" she muttered faintly.\n\n\"Giles and I went out at night to bid him be of good cheer. And there at\nthe tower foot was a brave lass, quite strange to me I vow, on the same\nerrand.\"\n\n\"Lookee there now, Kate.\"\n\n\"At first we did properly frighten one another, through the place his\nbad name, and our poor heads being so full o' divels, and we whitened a\nbit in moonshine. But next moment, quo' I, 'You are Margaret.' 'And you\nare Kate,' quo' she. Think on't!\"\n\n\"Did one ever? 'Twas Gerard! He will have been talking backards and\nforrards of thee to her, and her to thee.\"\n\nIn return for this, Kate bestowed on Catherine one of the prettiest\npresents in nature--the composite kiss, i.e., she imprinted on her cheek\na single kiss, which said--\n\n     1. Quite correct.\n     2. Good, clever mother, for guessing so right and quick.\n     3. How sweet for us twain to be' of one mind again after\n     never having been otherwise.\n     4. Etc.\n\n\"Now then, speak thy mind, child, Gerard is not here. Alas, what am I\nsaying? would to Heaven he were.\"\n\n\"Well then, mother, she is comely, and wrongs her picture but little.\"\n\n\"Eh, dear; hark to young folk! I am for good acts, not good looks. Loves\nshe my boy as he did ought to be loved?\"\n\n\"Sevenbergen is farther from the Stadthouse than we are,\" said Kate\nthoughtfully; \"yet she was there afore me.\"\n\nCatherine nodded intelligence.\n\n\"Nay, more, she had got him out ere I came. Ay, down from the captive's\ntower.\"\n\nCatherine shook her head incredulously. \"The highest tower for miles! It\nis not feasible.\"\n\n\"'Tis sooth though. She and an old man she brought found means and wit\nto send him up a rope. There 'twas dangling from his prison, and our\nGiles went up it. When first I saw it hang, I said, 'This is glamour.'\nBut when the frank lass's arms came round me, and her bosom' did beat\non mine, and her cheeks wet, then said I, ''Tis not glamour: 'tis love.'\nFor she is not like me, but lusty and able; and, dear heart, even I,\npoor frail creature, do feel sometimes as I could move the world for\nthem I love: I love you, mother. And she loves Gerard.\"\n\n\"God bless her for't! God bless her!\"\n\n\"But\n\n\"But what, lamb?\"\n\n\"Her love, is it for very certain honest? 'Tis most strange; but that\nvery thing, which hath warmed your heart, hath somewhat cooled mine\ntowards her; poor soul. She is no wife, you know, mother, when all is\ndone.\"\n\n\"Humph! They have stood at the altar together.\"\n\n\"Ay, but they went as they came, maid and bachelor.\"\n\n\"The parson, saith he so?\"\n\n\"Nay, for that I know not.\"\n\n\"Then I'll take no man's word but his in such a tangled skein.\"\nAfter some reflection she added, \"Natheless art right, girl; I'll to\nSevenbergen alone. A wife I am but not a slave. We are all in the dark\nhere. And she holds the clue. I must question her, and no one by; least\nof all you. I'll not take any lily to a house Wi' a spot, no, not to a\npalace o' gold and silver.\"\n\nThe more Catherine pondered this conversation, the more she felt drawn\ntowards Margaret, and moreover \"she was all agog\" with curiosity, a\npotent passion with us all, and nearly omnipotent with those who like\nCatherine, do not slake it with reading. At last, one fine day, after\ndinner, she whispered to Kate, \"Keep the house from going to pieces, an\nye can;\" and donned her best kirtle and hood, and her scarlet clocked\nhose and her new shoes, and trudged briskly off to Sevenbergen,\ntroubling no man's mule.\n\nWhen she got there she inquired where Margaret Brandt lived. The first\nperson she asked shook his head, and said--\"The name is strange to me.\"\nShe went a little farther and asked a girl of about fifteen who was\nstanding at a door. \"Father,\" said the girl, speaking into the house,\n\"here is another after that magician's daughter.\" The man came out and\ntold Catherine Peter Brandt's cottage was just outside the town on the\neast side. \"You may see the chimney hence;\" and he pointed it out to\nher. \"But you will not find them there, neither father nor daughter;\nthey have left the town this week, bless you.\"\n\n\"Say not so, good man, and me walken all the way from Tergou.\"\n\n\"From Tergou? then you must ha' met the soldier.\"\n\n\"What soldier? ay, I did meet a soldier.\"\n\n\"Well, then, yon soldier was here seeking that self-same Margaret.\"\n\n\"Ay, and warn't a mad with us because she was gone?\" put in the girl.\n\"His long beard and her cheek are no strangers, I warrant.\"\n\n\"Say no more than ye know,\" said Catherine sharply. \"You are young to\ntake to slandering your elders. Stay! tell we more about this soldier,\ngood man.\n\n\"Nay, I know no more than that he came hither seeking Margaret Brandt,\nand I told him she and her father had made a moonlight flit on't this\nday sennight, and that some thought the devil had flown away with them,\nbeing magicians. 'And,' says he, 'the devil fly away with thee for thy\nill news;' that was my thanks. 'But I doubt 'tis a lie,' said he. 'An\nyou think so,' said I, 'go and see.' 'I will,' said he, and burst out\nwi' a hantle o' gibberish: my wife thinks 'twas curses; and hied him to\nthe cottage. Presently back a comes, and sings t'other tune. 'You were\nright and I was wrong,' says he, and shoves a silver coin in my hand.\nShow it the wife, some of ye; then she'll believe me; I have been called\na liar once to-day.\"\n\n\"It needs not,\" said Catherine, inspecting the coin all the same.\n\n\"And he seemed quiet and sad like, didn't he now, wench?\"\n\n\"That a did,\" said the young woman warmly; \"and, dame, he was just as\npretty a man as ever I clapped eyes on. Cheeks like a rose, and shining\nbeard, and eyes in his head like sloes.\"\n\n\"I saw he was well bearded,\" said Catherine; \"but, for the rest, at my\nage I scan them not as when I was young and foolish. But he seemed right\ncivil: doffed his bonnet to me as I had been a queen, and I did drop him\nmy best reverence, for manners beget manners. But little I wist he had\nbeen her light o' love, and most likely the--Who bakes for this town?\"\n\nThe man, not being acquainted with her, opened his eyes at this\ntransition, swift and smooth.\n\n\"Well, dame, there be two; John Bush and Eric Donaldson, they both bide\nin this street.\"\n\n\"Then, God be with you, good people,\" said she, and proceeded; but her\nsprightly foot came flat on the ground now, and no longer struck it with\nlittle jerks and cocking heel. She asked the bakers whether Peter\nBrandt had gone away in their debt. Bush said they were not customers.\nDonaldson said, \"Not a stiver: his daughter had come round and paid\nhim the very night they went. Didn't believe they owed a copper in the\ntown.\" So Catherine got all the information of that kind she wanted with\nvery little trouble.\n\n\"Can you tell me what sort this Margaret was?\" said she, as she turned\nto go.\n\n\"Well, somewhat too reserved for my taste. I like a chatty\ncustomer--when I'm not too busy. But she bore a high character for being\na good daughter.\"\n\n\"'Tis no small praise. A well-looking lass, I am told?\"\n\n\"Why, whence come you, wyfe?\"\n\n\"From Tergou.\"\n\n\"Oh, ay. Well you shall judge: the lads clept her 'the beauty of\nSevenbergen;' the lasses did scout it merrily, and terribly pulled her\nto pieces, and found so many faults no two could agree where the fault\nlay.\"\n\n\"That is enough,\" said Catherine. \"I see, the bakers are no fools in\nSevenbergen, and the young women no shallower than in other burghs.\"\n\nShe bought a manchet of bread, partly out of sympathy and justice (she\nkept a shop), partly to show her household how much better bread she\ngave them daily; and returned to Tergou dejected.\n\nKate met her outside the town with beaming eyes.\n\n\"Well, Kate, lass, it is a happy thing I went; I am heartbroken. Gerard\nhas been sore abused. The child is none of ourn, nor the mother from\nthis hour.\"\n\n\"Alas, mother, I fathom not your meaning.\"\n\n\"Ask me no more, girl, but never mention her name to me again. That is\nall.\"\n\nKate acquiesced with a humble sigh, and they went home together.\n\nThey found a soldier seated tranquilly by their fire. The moment they\nentered the door he rose, and saluted them civilly. They stood and\nlooked at him; Kate with some little surprise, but Catherine with a\ngreat deal, and with rising indignation.\n\n\"What makes you here?\" was Catherine's greeting.\n\n\"I came to seek after Margaret.\"\n\n\"Well, we know no such person.\"\n\n\"Say not so, dame; sure you know her by name, Margaret Brandt.\"\n\n\"We have heard of her for that matter--to our cost.\"\n\n\"Comes, dame, prithee tell me at least where she bides.\"\n\n\"I know not where she bides, and care not.\"\n\nDenys felt sure this was a deliberate untruth. He bit his lip. \"Well, I\nlooked to find myself in an enemy's country at this Tergou; but maybe if\nye knew all ye would not be so dour.\"\n\n\"I do know all,\" replied Catherine bitterly. \"This morn I knew nought.\"\nThen suddenly setting her arms akimbo she told him with a raised voice\nand flashing eyes she wondered at his cheek sitting down by that hearth\nof all hearths in the world.\n\n\"May Satan fly away with your hearth to the lake of fire and brimstone,\"\nshouted Denys, who could speak Flemish fluently. \"Your own servant bade\nme sit there till you came, else I had ne'er troubled your hearth. My\nmalison on it, and on the churlish roof-tree that greets an unoffending\nstranger this way,\" and he strode scowling to the door.\n\n\"Oh! oh!\" ejaculated Catherine, frightened, and also a little\nconscience-stricken; and the virago sat suddenly down and burst into\ntears. Her daughter followed suit quietly, but without loss of time.\n\nA shrewd writer, now unhappily lost to us, has somewhere the following\ndialogue:\n\nShe. \"I feel all a woman's weakness.\"\n\nHe. \"Then you are invincible.\"\n\nDenys, by anticipation, confirmed that valuable statement; he stood at\nthe door looking ruefully at the havoc his thunderbolt of eloquence had\nmade.\n\n\"Nay, wife,\" said he, \"weep not neither for a soldier's hasty word. I\nmean not all I said. Why, your house is your own, and what right in it\nhave I? There now, I'll go.\"\n\n\"What is to do?\" said a grave manly voice.\n\nIt was Eli; he had come in from the shop.\n\n\"Here is a ruffian been a-scolding of your women folk and making them\ncry,\" explained Denys.\n\n\"Little Kate, what is't? for ruffians do not use to call themselves\nruffians,\" said Eli the sensible.\n\nEre she could explain, \"Hold your tongue, girl,\" said Catherine; \"Muriel\nbade him sat down, and I knew not that, and wyted on him; and he was\ngoing and leaving his malison on us, root and branch. I was never so\nbecursed in all my days, oh! oh! oh!\"\n\n\"You were both somewhat to blame; both you and he,\" said Eli calmly.\n\"However, what the servant says the master should still stand to. We\nkeep not open house, but yet we are not poor enough to grudge a seat at\nour hearth in a cold day to a wayfarer with an honest face, and, as I\nthink, a wounded man. So, end all malice, and sit ye down!\"\n\n\"Wounded?\" cried mother and daughter in a breath.\n\n\"Think you a soldier slings his arm for sport?\"\n\n\"Nay, 'tis but an arrow,\" said Denys cheerfully.\n\n\"But an arrow?\" said Kate, with concentrated horror. \"Where were our\neyes, mother?\"\n\n\"Nay, in good sooth, a trifle. Which, however, I will pray mesdames to\naccept as an excuse for my vivacity. 'Tis these little foolish trifling\nwounds that fret a man, worthy sir. Why, look ye now, sweeter temper\nthan our Gerard never breathed, yet, when the bear did but strike a\npiece no bigger than a crown out of his calf, he turned so hot and\ncholeric y'had said he was no son of yours, but got by the good knight\nSir John Pepper on his wife dame Mustard; who is this? a dwarf? your\nservant, Master Giles.\"\n\n\"Your servant, soldier,\" roared the newcomer. Denys started. He had not\ncounted on exchanging greetings with a petard.\n\nDenys's words had surprised his hosts, but hardly more than their\ndeportment now did him. They all three came creeping up to where he sat,\nand looked down into him with their lips parted, as if he had been some\nstrange phenomenon.\n\nAnd growing agitation succeeded to amazement.\n\n\"Now hush!\" said Eli, \"let none speak but I. Young man,\" said he\nsolemnly, \"in God's name who are you, that know us though we know you\nnot, and that shake our hearts speaking to us of--the absent-our poor\nrebellious son: whom Heaven forgive and bless?\"\n\n\"What, master,\" said Denys, lowering his voice, \"hath he not writ to\nyou? hath he not told you of me, Denys of Burgundy?\"\n\n\"He hath writ, but three lines, and named not Denys of Burgundy, nor any\nstranger.\"\n\n\"Ay, I mind the long letter was to his sweetheart, this Margaret, and\nshe has decamped, plague take her, and how I am to find her Heaven\nknows.\"\n\n\"What, she is not your sweetheart then?\"\n\n\"Who, dame? an't please you.\"\n\n\"Why, Margaret Brandt.\"\n\n\"How can my comrade's sweetheart be mine? I know her not from Noah's\nniece; how should I? I never saw her.\"\n\n\"Whist with this idle chat, Kate,\" said Eli impatiently, \"and let the\nyoung man answer me. How came you to know Gerard, our son? Prithee now\nthink on a parent's cares, and answer me straightforward, like a soldier\nas thou art.\"\n\n\"And shall. I was paid off at Flushing, and started for Burgundy. On\nthe German frontier I lay at the same inn with Gerard. I fancied him. I\nsaid, 'Be my comrade.' He was loth at first; consented presently. Many a\nweary league we trode together. Never were truer comrades: never will be\nwhile earth shall last. First I left my route a bit to be with him: then\nhe his to be with me. We talked of Sevenbergen and Tergou a thousand\ntimes; and of all in this house. We had our troubles on the road; but\nbattling them together made them light. I saved his life from a bear; he\nmine in the Rhine: for he swims like a duck and I like a hod o' bricks\nand one another's lives at an inn in Burgundy, where we two held a room\nfor a good hour against seven cut-throats, and crippled one and slew\ntwo; and your son did his devoir like a man, and met the stoutest\nchampion I ever countered, and spitted him like a sucking-pig. Else I\nhad not been here. But just when all was fair, and I was to see him safe\naboard ship for Rome, if not to Rome itself, met us that son of a--the\nLord Anthony of Burgundy, and his men, making for Flanders, then in\ninsurrection, tore us by force apart, took me where I got some broad\npieces in hand, and a broad arrow in my shoulder, and left my poor\nGerard lonesome. At that sad parting, soldier though I be, these eyes\ndid rain salt scalding tears, and so did his, poor soul. His last word\nto me was, 'Go, comfort Margaret!' so here I be. Mine to him was, 'Think\nno more of Rome. Make for Rhine, and down stream home.' Now say, for you\nknow best, did I advise him well or ill?\"\n\n\"Soldier, take my hand,\" said Eli. \"God bless thee! God bless thee!\"\nand his lip quivered. It was all his reply, but more eloquent than many\nwords.\n\nCatherine did not answer at all, but she darted from the room and bade\nMuriel bring the best that was in the house, and returned with wood in\nboth arms, and heaped the fire, and took out a snow-white cloth from\nthe press, and was going in a great hurry to lay it for Gerard's friend,\nwhen suddenly she sat down and all the power ebbed rapidly out of her\nbody.\n\n\"Father!\" cried Kate, whose eye was as quick as her affection.\n\nDenys started up; but Eli waved him back and flung a little water\nsharply in his wife's face. This did her instant good. She gasped, \"So\nsudden. My poor boy!\" Eli whispered Denys, \"Take no notice! she thinks\nof him night and day.\" They pretended not to observe her, and she shook\nit off, and hustled and laid the cloth with her own hands; but as she\nsmoothed it, her hands trembled and a tear or two stole down her cheeks.\n\nThey could not make enough of Denys. They stuffed him, and crammed him;\nand then gathered round him and kept filling his glass in turn, while by\nthat genial blaze of fire and ruby wine and eager eyes he told all that\nI have related, and a vast number of minor details, which an artist,\nhowever minute, omits.\n\nBut how different the effect on my readers and on this small circle! To\nthem the interest was already made before the first word came from his\nlips. It was all about Gerard, and he who sat there telling it them, was\nwarm from Gerard and an actor with him in all these scenes.\n\nThe flesh and blood around that fire quivered for their severed member,\nhearing its struggles and perils.\n\nI shall ask my readers to recall to memory all they can of Gerard's\njourney with Denys, and in their mind's eye to see those very matters\ntold by his comrade to an exile's father, all stoic outside, all father\nwithin, and to two poor women, an exile's mother and a sister, who were\nall love and pity and tender anxiety both outside and in. Now would you\nmind closing this book for a minute and making an effort to realize all\nthis? It will save us so much repetition.\n\n\nThen you will not be surprised when I tell you that after a while Giles\ncame softly and curled himself up before the fire, and lay gazing at the\nspeaker with a reverence almost canine; and that, when the rough soldier\nhad unconsciously but thoroughly betrayed his better qualities, and\nabove all his rare affection for Gerard, Kate, though timorous as a\nbird, stole her little hand into the warrior's huge brown palm, where\nit lay an instant like a tea-spoonful of cream spilt on a platter, then\nnipped the ball of his thumb and served for a Kardiometer. In other\nwords, Fate is just even to rival storytellers, and balances matters.\nDenys had to pay a tax to his audience which I have not. Whenever Gerard\nwas in too much danger, the female faces became so white, and their poor\nlittle throats gurgled so, he was obliged in common humanity to\nspoil his recital. Suspense is the soul of narrative, and thus dealt\nRough-and-Tender of Burgundy with his best suspenses. \"Now, dame, take\nnot on till ye hear the end; ma'amselle, let not your cheek blanch so;\ncourage! it looks ugly; but you shall hear how we won through. Had he\nmiscarried, and I at hand, would I be alive?\"\n\nAnd meantime Kate's little Kardiometer, or heart-measurer, graduated\nemotion, and pinched by scale. At its best it was by no means a\nhigh-pressure engine. But all is relative. Denys soon learned the tender\ngamut; and when to water the suspense, and extract the thrill as far as\npossible. On one occasion only he cannily indemnified his narrative for\nthis drawback. Falling personally into the Rhine, and sinking, he got\npinched, he Denys, to his surprise and satisfaction. \"Oho!\" thought he,\nand on the principle of the anatomists, \"experimentum in corpore vili,\"\nkept himself a quarter of an hour under water; under pressure all the\ntime. And even when Gerard had got hold of him, he was loth to leave the\nriver, so, less conscientious than I was, swam with Gerard to the east\nbank first, and was about to land, but detected the officers and their\nintent, chaffed them a little space, treading water, then turned and\nswam wearily all across, and at last was obliged to get out, for very\nshame, or else acknowledge himself a pike; so permitted himself to land,\nexhausted: and the pressure relaxed.\n\n\nIt was eleven o'clock, an unheard-of hour, but they took no note of time\nthis night; and Denys had still much to tell them, when the door was\nopened quietly, and in stole Cornelis and Sybrandt looking hang-dog.\nThey had this night been drinking the very last drop of their mysterious\nfunds.\n\nCatherine feared her husband would rebuke them before Denys; but he only\nlooked sadly at them, and motioned them to sit down quietly.\n\nDenys it was who seemed discomposed. He knitted his brows and eyed them\nthoughtfully and rather gloomily. Then turned to Catherine. \"What say\nyou, dame? the rest to-morrow; for I am somewhat weary, and it waxes\nlate.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" said Eli. But when Denys rose to go to his inn, he was\ninstantly stopped by Catherine. \"And think you to lie from this house?\nGerard's room has been got ready for you hours agone; the sheets I'll\nnot say much for, seeing I spun the flax and wove the web.\"\n\n\"Then would I lie in them blindfold,\" was the gallant reply. \"Ah, dame,\nour poor Gerard was the one for fine linen. He could hardly forgive the\nhonest Germans their coarse flax, and whene'er my traitors of countrymen\ndid amiss, a would excuse them, saying, 'Well, well; bonnes toiles sont\nen Bourgogne:' that means, there be good lenten cloths in Burgundy.' But\nindeed he beat all for bywords and cleanliness.\n\n\"Oh, Eli! Eli! doth not our son come back to us at each word?\"\n\n\"Ay. Buss me, my poor Kate. You and I know all that passeth in each\nother's hearts this night. None other can, but God.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII\n\nDenys took an opportunity next day and told mother and daughter the\nrest, excusing himself characteristically for not letting Cornelis and\nSybrandt hear of it. \"It is not for me to blacken them; they come of\na good stock. But Gerard looks on them as no friends of his in this\nmatter; and I'm Gerard's comrade and it is a rule with us soldiers not\nto tell the enemy aught--but lies.\"\n\nCatherine sighed, but made no answer.\n\nThe adventures he related cost them a tumult of agitation and grief, and\nsore they wept at the parting of the friends, which even now Denys could\nnot tell without faltering. But at last all merged in the joyful hope\nand expectation of Gerard's speedy return. In this Denys confidently\nshared; but reminded them that was no reason why he should neglect his\nfriend's wishes and last words. In fact, should Gerard return next week,\nand no Margaret to be found, what sort of figure should he cut?\n\nCatherine had never felt so kindly towards the truant Margaret as now;\nand she was fully as anxious to find her, and be kind to her before\nGerard's return, as Denys was; but she could not agree with him that\nanything was to be gained by leaving this neighbourhood to search for\nher. \"She must have told somebody whither she was going. It is not\nas though they were dishonest folk flying the country; they owe not a\nstiver in Sevenbergen; and dear heart, Denys, you can't hunt all Holland\nfor her.\"\n\n\"Can I not?\" said Denys grimly. \"That we shall see.\" He added, after\nsome reflection, that they must divide their forces; she stay here with\neyes and ears wide open, and he ransack every town in Holland for her,\nif need be. \"But she will not be many leagues from here. They be three.\nThree fly not so fast, nor far, as one.\"\n\n\"That is sense,\" said Catherine. But she insisted on his going first to\nthe demoiselle Van Eyck. \"She and our Margaret were bosom friends. She\nknows where the girl is gone, if she will but tell us.\" Denys was for\ngoing to her that instant, so Catherine, in a turn of the hand, made\nherself one shade neater, and took him with her.\n\nShe was received graciously by the old lady sitting in a richly\nfurnished room; and opened her business. The tapestry dropped out of\nMargaret Van Eyck's hands. \"Gone? Gone from Sevenbergen and not told me;\nthe thankless girl.\"\n\nThis turn greatly surprised the visitors. \"What, you know not? when was\nshe here last?\"\n\n\"Maybe ten days agone. I had ta'en out my brushes, after so many years,\nto paint her portrait. I did not do it, though; for reasons.\"\n\nCatherine remarked it was \"a most strange thing she should go away bag\nand baggage like this, without with your leave or by your leave, why, or\nwherefore. Was ever aught so untoward; just when all our hearts are warm\nto her; and here is Gerard's mate come from the ends of the earth with\ncomfort for her from Gerard, and can't find her, and Gerard himself\nexpected. What to do I know not. But sure she is not parted like this\nwithout a reason. Can ye not give us the clue, my good demoiselle?\nPrithee now.\n\n\"I have it not to give,\" said the elder lady, rather peevishly.\n\n\"Then I can,\" said Reicht Heynes, showing herself in the doorway, with\ncolour somewhat heightened.\n\n\"So you have been hearkening all the time, eh?\"\n\n\"What are my ears for, mistress?\"\n\n\"True. Well, throw us the light of thy wisdom on this dark matter.\"\n\n\"There is no darkness that I see,\" said Reicht. \"And the clue, why, an\nye call't a two-plye twine, and the ends on't in this room e'en now,\nye'll not be far out. Oh, mistress, I wonder at you sitting there\npretending.\"\n\n\"Marry, come up.\" and the mistress's cheek was now nearly as red as the\nservant's. \"So 'twas I drove the foolish girl away.\"\n\n\"You did your share, mistress. What sort of greeting gave you her\nlast time she came? Think you she could miss to notice it, and she all\nfriendless? And you said, 'I have altered my mind about painting of\nyou,' says you, a turning up your nose at her.\"\n\n\"I did not turn up my nose. It is not shaped like yours for looking\nheavenward.\"\n\n\"Oh, all our nosen can follow our heartys bent, for that matter. Poor\nsoul. She did come into the kitchen to me. 'I am not to be painted now,'\nsaid she, and the tears in her eyes. She said no more. But I knew well\nwhat she did mean. I had seen ye.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Margaret Van Eyck, \"I do confess so much, and I make you\nthe judge, madam. Know that these young girls can do nothing of their\nown heads, but are most apt at mimicking aught their sweethearts do. Now\nyour Gerard is reasonably handy at many things, and among the rest at\nthe illuminator's craft. And Margaret she is his pupil, and a patient\none: what marvel? having a woman's eye for colour, and eke a lover to\nape. 'Tis a trick I despise at heart: for by it the great art of colour,\nwhich should be royal, aspiring, and free, becomes a poor slave to the\npetty crafts of writing and printing, and is fettered, imprisoned, and\nmade little, body and soul, to match the littleness of books, and go to\nchurch in a rich fool's pocket. Natheless affection rules us all, and\nwhen the poor wench would bring me her thorn leaves, and lilies, and\nivy, and dewberries, and ladybirds, and butterfly grubs, and all the\nscum of Nature-stuck fast in gold-leaf like wasps in a honey-pot, and\nwithal her diurnal book, showing she had pored an hundred, or an hundred\nand fifty, or two hundred hours over each singular page, certes I was\nwroth that an immortal soul, and many hours of labour, and much manual\nskill, should be flung away on Nature's trash, leaves, insects, grubs,\nand on barren letters; but, having bowels, I did perforce restrain, and\nas it were, dam my better feelings, and looked kindly at the work to\nsee how it might be bettered; and said I, 'Sith Heaven for our sins\nhath doomed us to spend time, and soul, and colour on great letters and\nlittle beetles, omitting such small fry as saints and heroes, their\nacts and passions, why not present the scum naturally?' I told her 'the\ngrapes I saw, walking abroad, did hang i' the air, not stick in a wall;\nand even these insects,' quo' I, 'and Nature her slime in general, pass\nnot their noxious lives wedged miserably in metal prisons like flies\nin honey-pots and glue-pots, but do crawl or hover at large, infesting\nair.' 'Ah my dear friend,' says she, 'I see now whither you drive; but\nthis ground is gold; whereon we may not shade.' 'Who said so?' quoth\nI. 'All teachers of this craft,' says she; and (to make an end o' me at\nonce, I trow) 'Gerard himself!' 'That for Gerard himself,' quoth I, 'and\nall the gang; gi'e me a brush!'\n\n\"Then chose I, to shade her fruit and reptiles, a colour false in\nnature, but true relatively to that monstrous ground of glaring gold;\nand in five minutes out came a bunch of raspberries, stalk and all, and\na'most flew in your mouth; likewise a butterfly grub she had so truly\npresented as might turn the stoutest stomach. My lady she flings her\narms round my neck, and says she, 'Oh!'\"\n\n\"Did she now?\"\n\n\"The little love!\" observed Denys, succeeding at last in wedging in a\nword.\n\nMargaret Van Eyck stared at him; and then smiled. She went on to tell\nthem how from step to step she had been led on to promise to resume the\nart she had laid aside with a sigh when her brothers died, and to paint\nthe Madonna once more--with Margaret for model. Incidentally she even\nrevealed how girls are turned into saints. \"Thy hair is adorable,\" said\nI. \"Why, 'tis red,\" quo' she. \"Ay,\" quoth I, \"but what a red! how brown!\nhow glossy! most hair is not worth a straw to us painters; thine the\nartist's very hue. But thy violet eyes, which smack of earth, being now\nlanguid for lack of one Gerard, now full of fire in hopes of the same\nGerard, these will I lift to heaven in fixed and holy meditation, and\nthy nose, which doth already somewhat aspire that way (though not so\npiously as Reicht's), will I debase a trifle, and somewhat enfeeble thy\nchin.\"\n\n\"Enfeeble her chin? Alack! what may that mean? Ye go beyond me,\nmistress.\"\n\n\"'Tis a resolute chin. Not a jot too resolute for this wicked world; but\nwhen ye come to a Madonna? No thank you.\"\n\n\"Well I never. A resolute chin.\"\n\nDenys. \"The darling!\"\n\n\"And now comes the rub. When you told me she was--the way she is, it\ngave me a shock; I dropped my brushes. Was I going to turn a girl, that\ncouldn't keep her lover at a distance, into the Virgin Mary, at my time\nof life? I love the poor ninny still. But I adore our blessed Lady.\nSay you, 'a painter must not be peevish in such matters'? Well, most\npainters are men; and men are fine fellows. They can do aught. Their\nsaints and virgins are neither more nor less than their lemans, saving\nyour presence. But know that for this very reason half their craft\nis lost on me, which find beneath their angels' white wings the very\ntrollops I have seen flaunting it on the streets, bejewelled like Paynim\nidols, and put on like the queens in a pack o' cards. And I am not a\nfine fellow, but only a woman, and my painting is but one half craft,\nand t'other half devotion. So now you may read me. 'Twas foolish,\nmaybe, but I could not help it; yet am I sorry.\" And the old lady ended\ndespondently a discourse which she had commenced in a'mighty defiant\ntone.\n\n\"Well, you know, dame,\" observed Catherine, \"you must think it would go\nto the poor girl's heart, and she so fond of ye?\"\n\nMargaret Van Eyck only sighed.\n\nThe Frisian girl, after biting her lips impatiently a little while,\nturned upon Catherine. \"Why, dame, think you 'twas for that alone\nMargaret and Peter hath left Sevenbergen? Nay.\"\n\n\"For what else, then?\"\n\n\"What else? Why, because Gerard's people slight her so cruel. Who would\nbide among hard-hearted folk that ha' driven her lad t' Italy, and now\nhe is gone, relent not, but face it out, and ne'er come anigh her that\nis left?\"\n\n\"Reicht, I was going.\"\n\n\"Oh, ay, going, and going, and going. Ye should ha' said less or else\ndone more. But with your words you did uplift her heart and let it down\nwi' your deeds. 'They have never been,' said the poor thing to me, with\nsuch a sigh. Ay, here is one can feel for her: for I too am far from my\nfriends, and often, when first I came to Holland, I did used to take a\nhearty cry all to myself. But ten times liever would I be Reicht Heynes\nwith nought but the leagues atw'een me and all my kith, than be as she\nis i' the midst of them that ought to warm to her, and yet to fare as\nlonesome as I.\"\n\n\"Alack, Reicht, I did go but yestreen, and had gone before, but one\nplaguy thing or t'other did still come and hinder me.\"\n\n\"Mistress, did aught hinder ye to eat your dinner any one of those days?\nI trow not. And had your heart been as good towards your own flesh and\nblood, as 'twas towards your flesher's meat, nought had prevailed to\nkeep you from her that sat lonely, a watching the road for you and\ncomfort, wi' your child's child a beating 'neath her bosom.\"\n\nHere this rude young woman was interrupted by an incident not uncommon\nin a domestic's bright existence. The Van Eyck had been nettled by the\nattack on her, but with due tact had gone into ambush. She now sprang\nout of it. \"Since you disrespect my guests, seek another place!\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said Reicht stoutly.\n\n\"Nay, mistress,\" put in the good-natured Catherine. \"True folk will\nstill speak out. Her tongue is a stinger.\" Here the water came into\nthe speaker's eyes by way of confirmation. \"But better she said it than\nthought it. So now 't won't rankle in her. And part with her for me,\nthat shall ye not. Beshrew the wench, she wots she is a good servant,\nand takes advantage. We poor wretches which keep house must still pay\n'em tax for value. I had a good servant once, when I was a young\nwoman. Eh dear, how she did grind me down into the dust. In the end,\nby Heaven's mercy, she married the baker, and I was my own woman again.\n'So,' said I, 'no more good servants shall come hither, a hectoring o'\nme.' I just get a fool and learn her; and whenever she knoweth her right\nhand from her left, she sauceth me: then out I bundle her neck and\ncrop, and take another dunce in her place. Dear heart, 'tis wearisome,\nteaching a string of fools by ones; but there--I am mistress:\" here she\nforgot that she was defending Reicht, and turning rather spitefully upon\nher, added, \"and you be mistress here, I trow.\"\n\n\"No more than that stool,\" said the Van Eyck loftily. \"She is neither\nmistress nor servant; but Gone. She is dismissed the house, and there's\nan end of her. What, did ye not hear me turn the saucy baggage off?\"\n\n\"Ay, ay. We all heard ye,\" said Reicht, with vast indifference.\n\n\"Then hear me!\" said Denys solemnly.\n\nThey all went round like things on wheels, and fastened their eyes on\nhim.\n\n\"Ay, let us hear what the man says,\" urged the hostess. \"Men are fine\nfellows, with their great hoarse voices.\"\n\n\"Mistress Reicht,\" said Denys, with great dignity and ceremony, indeed\nso great as to verge on the absurd, \"you are turned off. If on a slight\nacquaintance I might advise, I'd say, since you are a servant no more,\nbe a mistress, a queen.\"\n\n\"Easier said than done,\" replied Reicht bluntly.\n\n\"Not a jot. You see here one who is a man, though but half an\narbalestrier, owing to that devilish Englishman's arrow, in whose\ncarcass I have, however, left a like token, which is a comfort. I have\ntwenty gold pieces\" (he showed them) \"and a stout arm. In another\nweek or so I shall have twain. Marriage is not a habit of mine; but\nI capitulate to so many virtues. You are beautiful, good-hearted, and\noutspoken, and above all, you take the part of my she-comrade. Be then\nan arbalestriesse!\"\n\n\"And what the dickens is that?\" inquired Reicht.\n\n\"I mean, be the wife, mistress, and queen of Denys of Burgundy here\npresent.\"\n\nA dead silence fell on all.\n\nIt did not last long, though; and was followed by a burst of\nunreasonable indignation.\n\nCatherine. \"Well, did you ever?\"\n\nMargaret. \"Never in all my born days.\"\n\nCatherine. \"Before our very faces.\"\n\nMargaret. \"Of all the absurdity, and insolence of this ridiculous sex--\"\n\nThen Denys observed somewhat drily, that the female to whom he had\naddressed himself was mute; and the others, on whose eloquence there was\nno immediate demand, were fluent: on this the voices stopped, and the\neyes turned pivot-like upon Reicht.\n\nShe took a sly glance from under her lashes at her military assailant,\nand said, \"I mean to take a good look at any man ere I leap into his\narms.\"\n\nDenys drew himself up majestically. \"Then look your fill, and leap\naway.\"\n\nThis proposal led to a new and most unexpected result. A long white\nfinger was extended by the Van Eyck in a line with the speaker's eye,\nand an agitated voice bade him stand, in the name of all the saints.\n\"You are beautiful, so,\" cried she. \"You are inspired--with folly. What\nmatters that? you are inspired. I must take off your head.\" And in a\nmoment she was at work with her pencil. \"Come out, hussy,\" she screamed\nto Reicht, \"more in front of him, and keep the fool inspired and\nbeautiful. Oh, why had I not this maniac for my good centurion? They\nwent and brought me a brute with a low forehead and a shapeless beard.\"\n\nCatherine stood and looked with utter amazement at this pantomime,\nand secretly resolved that her venerable hostess had been a disguised\nlunatic all this time, and was now busy throwing off the mask. As\nfor Reicht, she was unhappy and cross. She had left her caldron in a\nprecarious state, and made no scruple to say so, and that duties so\ngrave as hers left her no \"time to waste a playing the statee and the\nfool all at one time.\" Her mistress in reply reminded her that it was\npossible to be rude and rebellious to one's poor, old, affectionate,\ndesolate mistress, without being utterly heartless and savage; and a\ntrampler on arts.\n\nOn this Reicht stopped, and pouted, and looked like a little basilisk\nat the inspired model who caused her woe. He retorted with unshaken\nadmiration. The situation was at last dissolved by the artist's wrist\nbecoming cramped from disuse; this was not, however, until she had made\na rough but noble sketch. \"I can work no more at present,\" said she\nsorrowfully.\n\n\"Then, now, mistress, I may go and mind my pot?\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, go to your pot! And get into it, do; you will find your soul in\nit: so then you will all be together.\"\n\n\"Well, but, Reicht,\" said Catherine, laughing, \"she turned you off.\"\n\n\"Boo, boo, boo!\" said Reicht contemptuously. \"When she wants to get rid\nof me, let her turn herself off and die. I am sure she is old enough\nfor't. But take your time, mistress; if you are in no hurry, no more am\nI. When that day doth come, 'twill take a man to dry my eyes; and if you\nshould be in the same mind then, soldier, you can say so; and if you are\nnot, why, 'twill be all one to Reicht Heynes.\"\n\nAnd the plain speaker went her way. But her words did not fall to the\nground. Neither of her female hearers could disguise from herself that\nthis blunt girl, solitary herself, had probably read Margaret Brandt\naright, and that she had gone away from Sevenbergen broken-hearted.\n\nCatherine and Denys bade the Van Eyck adieu, and that same afternoon\nDenys set out on a wild goose chase. His plan, like all great things,\nwas simple. He should go to a hundred towns and villages, and ask in\neach after an old physician with a fair daughter, and an old long-bow\nsoldier. He should inquire of the burgomasters about all new-comers, and\nshould go to the fountains and watch the women and girls as they came\nwith their pitchers for water.\n\nAnd away he went, and was months and months on the tramp, and could not\nfind her.\n\nHappily, this chivalrous feat of friendship was in some degree its own\nreward.\n\nThose who sit at home blindfolded by self-conceit, and think camel\nor man out of the depths of their inner consciousness, alias their\nignorance, will tell you that in the intervals of war and danger, peace\nand tranquil life acquire their true value and satisfy the heroic mind.\nBut those who look before they babble or scribble will see and say\nthat men who risk their lives habitually thirst for exciting pleasures\nbetween the acts of danger, are not for innocent tranquility.\n\nTo this Denys was no exception. His whole military life had been\nhalf sparta, half Capua. And he was too good a soldier and too good a\nlibertine to have ever mixed either habit with the other. But now for\nthe first time he found himself mixed; at peace and yet on duty; for\nhe took this latter view of his wild goose chase, luckily. So all these\nmonths he was a demi-Spartan; sober, prudent, vigilant, indomitable; and\nhappy, though constantly disappointed, as might have been expected. He\nflirted gigantically on the road; but wasted no time about it. Nor in\nthese his wanderings did he tell a single female that \"marriage was not\none of his habits, etc.\"\n\nAnd so we leave him on the tramp, \"Pilgrim of Friendship,\" as his poor\ncomrade was of Love.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVIII\n\nCatherine was in dismay when she reflected that Gerard must reach home\nin another month at farthest, more likely in a week; and how should she\ntell him she had not even kept an eye upon his betrothed? Then there was\nthe uncertainty as to the girl's fate; and this uncertainty sometimes\ntook a sickening form.\n\n\"Oh, Kate,\" she groaned, \"if she should have gone and made herself\naway!\"\n\n\"Mother, she would never be so wicked.\"\n\n\"Ah, my lass, you know not what hasty fools young lasses be, that have\nno mothers to keep 'em straight. They will fling themselves into the\nwater for a man that the next man they meet would ha' cured 'em of in a\nweek. I have known 'em to jump in like brass one moment and scream for\nhelp in the next. Couldn't know their own minds ye see even about such\na trifle as yon. And then there's times when their bodies ail like no\nother living creatures ever I could hear of, and that strings up their\nfeelings so, the patience, that belongs to them at other times beyond\nall living souls barring an ass, seems all to jump out of 'em at\none turn, and into the water they go. Therefore, I say that men are\nmonsters.\"\n\n\"Mother!\"\n\n\"Monsters, and no less, to go making such heaps o' canals just to tempt\nthe poor women in. They know we shall not cut our throats, hating the\nsight of blood and rating our skins a hantle higher nor our lives; and\nas for hanging, while she is a fixing of the nail and a making of the\nnoose she has time t' alter her mind. But a jump into a canal is no more\nthan into bed; and the water it does all the lave, will ye, nill ye.\nWhy, look at me, the mother o' nine, wasn't I agog to make a hole in our\ncanal for the nonce?\"\n\n\"Nay, mother, I'll never believe it of you.\"\n\n\"Ye may, though. 'Twas in the first year of our keeping house together.\nEli hadn't found out my weak stitches then, nor I his; so we made a\nrent, pulling contrariwise; had a quarrel. So then I ran crying, to tell\nsome gabbling fool like myself what I had no business to tell out o'\ndoors except to the saints, and there was one of our precious canals in\nthe way; do they take us for teal? Oh, how tempting it did look! Says I\nto myself, 'Sith he has let me go out of his door quarrelled, he shall\nsee me drowned next, and then he will change his key. He will blubber\na good one, and I shall look down from heaven' (I forgot I should be in\nt'other part), 'and see him take on, and oh, but that will be sweet!'\nand I was all a tiptoe and going in, only just then I thought I\nwouldn't. I had got a new gown a making, for one thing, and hard upon\nfinished. So I went home instead, and what was Eli's first word, 'Let\nyon flea stick i' the wall, my lass,' says he. 'Not a word of all I said\nt' anger thee was sooth, but this, \"I love thee.\"' These were his very\nwords; I minded 'em, being the first quarrel. So I flung my arms about\nhis neck and sobbed a bit, and thought o' the canal; and he was no\ncolder to me than I to him, being a man and a young one; and so then\nthat was better than lying in the water; and spoiling my wedding kirtle\nand my fine new shoon, old John Bush made 'em, that was uncle to him\nkeeps the shop now. And what was my grief to hers?\"\n\nLittle Kate hoped that Margaret loved her father too much to think of\nleaving him so at his age. \"He is father and mother and all to her, you\nknow.\"\n\n\"Nay, Kate, they do forget all these things in a moment o' despair when\nthe very sky seems black above them. I place more faith in him that\nis unborn, than on him that is ripe for the grave, to keep her out o'\nmischief. For certes it do go sore against us to die when there's a\nlittle innocent a pulling at our hearts to let 'un live, and feeding at\nour very veins.\"\n\n\"Well, then, keep up a good heart, mother.\" She added, that very likely\nall these fears were exaggerated. She ended by solemnly entreating her\nmother at all events not to persist in naming the sex of Margaret's\ninfant. It was so unlucky, all the gossips told her; \"dear heart, as if\nthere were not as many girls born as boys.\"\n\nThis reflection, though not unreasonable, was met with clamour.\n\n\"Have you the cruelty to threaten me with a girl!!? I want no more\ngirls, while I have you. What use would a lass be to me? Can I set her\non my knee and see my Gerard again as I can a boy? I tell thee 'tis all\nsettled.\n\n\"How may that be?\"\n\n\"In my mind. And if I am to be disappointed i' the end, 'tisn't for you\nto disappoint me beforehand, telling me it is not to be a child, but\nonly a girl.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX\n\nMARGARET BRANDT had always held herself apart from Sevenbergen; and her\nreserve had passed for pride; this had come to her ears, and she knew\nmany hearts were swelling with jealousy and malevolence. How would they\ntriumph over her when her condition could no longer be concealed! This\nthought gnawed her night and day. For some time it had made her bury\nherself in the house, and shun daylight even on those rare occasions\nwhen she went abroad.\n\nNot that in her secret heart and conscience she mistook her moral\nsituation, as my unlearned readers have done perhaps. Though not\nacquainted with the nice distinctions of the contemporary law, she knew\nthat betrothal was a marriage contract, and could no more be legally\nbroken on either side than any other compact written and witnessed; and\nthat marriage with another party than the betrothed had been formerly\nannulled both by Church and State and that betrothed couples often\ncame together without any further ceremony, and their children were\nlegitimate.\n\nBut what weighed down her simple mediaeval mind was this: that very\ncontract of betrothal was not forthcoming. Instead of her keeping it,\nGerard had got it, and Gerard was far, far away. She hated and despised\nherself for the miserable oversight which had placed her at the mercy of\nfalse opinion.\n\nFor though she had never heard Horace's famous couplet, Segnius\nirritant, etc., she was Horatian by the plain, hard, positive\nintelligence, which, strange to say, characterizes the judgment of her\nsex, when feeling happens not to blind it altogether. She gauged the\nunderstanding of the world to a T. Her marriage lines being out\nof sight, and in Italy, would never prevail to balance her visible\npregnancy, and the sight of her child when born. What sort of a tale was\nthis to stop slanderous tongues? \"I have got my marriage lines, but I\ncannot show them you.\" What woman would believe her? or even pretend to\nbelieve her? And as she was in reality one of the most modest girls in\nHolland, it was women's good opinion she wanted, not men's.\n\nEven barefaced slander attacks her sex at a great advantage; but here\nwas slander with a face of truth. \"The strong-minded woman\" had not yet\nbeen invented; and Margaret, though by nature and by having been early\nmade mistress of a family, she was resolute in some respects, was weak\nas water in others, and weakest of all in this. Like all the elite\nof her sex, she was a poor little leaf, trembling at each gust of the\nworld's opinion, true or false. Much misery may be contained in few\nwords. I doubt if pages of description from any man's pen could make\nany human creature, except virtuous women (and these need no such aid),\nrealize the anguish of a virtuous woman foreseeing herself paraded as a\nfrail one. Had she been frail at heart, she might have brazened it out.\nBut she had not that advantage. She was really pure as snow, and saw the\npitch coming nearer her and nearer. The poor girl sat listless hours at\na time, and moaned with inner anguish. And often, when her father was\ntalking to her, and she giving mechanical replies, suddenly her cheek\nwould burn like fire, and the old man would wonder what he had said to\ndiscompose her. Nothing. His words were less than air to her. It was the\never-present dread sent the colour of shame into her burning cheek, no\nmatter what she seemed to be talking and thinking about. But both shame\nand fear rose to a climax when she came back that night from Margaret\nVan Eyck's. Her condition was discovered, and by persons of her own\nsex. The old artist, secluded like herself, might not betray her;\nbut Catherine, a gossip in the centre of a family, and a thick\nneighbourhood? One spark of hope remained. Catherine had spoken kindly,\neven lovingly. The situation admitted no half course. Gerard's mother\nthus roused must either be her best friend or worst enemy. She waited\nthen in racking anxiety to hear more. No word came. She gave up hope.\nCatherine was not going to be her friend. Then she would expose her,\nsince she had no strong and kindly feeling to balance the natural love\nof babbling.\n\nThen it was the wish to fly from this neighbourhood began to grow and\ngnaw upon her, till it became a wild and passionate desire. But how\npersuade her father to this? Old people cling to places. He was very old\nand infirm to change his abode. There was no course but to make him her\nconfidant; better so than to run away from him; and she felt that would\nbe the alternative. And now between her uncontrollable desire to fly\nand hide, and her invincible aversion to speak out to a man, even to her\nfather, she vibrated in a suspense full of lively torture. And presently\nbetwixt these two came in one day the fatal thought, \"end all!\" Things\nfoolishly worded are not always foolish; one of poor Catherine's\nbugbears, these numerous canals, did sorely tempt this poor fluctuating\ngirl. She stood on the bank one afternoon, and eyed the calm deep water.\nIt seemed an image of repose, and she was so harassed. No more trouble.\nNo more fear of shame. If Gerard had not loved her, I doubt she had\nended there.\n\nAs it was, she kneeled by the water side, and prayed fervently to God to\nkeep such wicked thoughts from her. \"Oh! selfish wretch,\" said she, \"to\nleave thy father. Oh, wicked wretch, to kill thy child, and make thy\npoor Gerard lose all his pain and peril undertaken for thy sight. I will\ntell father all, ay, ere this sun shall set.\" And she went home with\neager haste, lest her good resolution should ooze out ere she got there.\n\nNow, in matters domestic the learned Peter was simple as a child, and\nMargaret, from the age of sixteen, had governed the house gently\nbut absolutely. It was therefore a strange thing in this house, the\nfaltering, irresolute way in which its young but despotic mistress\naddressed that person, who in a domestic sense was less important\nthan Martin Wittenhaagen, or even than the little girl who came in the\nmorning and for a pittance washed the vessels, etc., and went home at\nnight.\n\n\"Father, I would speak to thee.\"\n\n\"Speak on, girl.\"\n\n\"Wilt listen to me? And--and--not--and try to excuse my faults?\"\n\n\"We have all our faults, Margaret, thou no more than the rest of us; but\nfewer, unless parental feeling blinds me.\"\n\n\"Alas, no, father: I am a poor foolish girl, that would fain do well,\nbut have done ill, most ill, most unwisely; and now must bear the shame.\nBut, father, I love you, with all my faults, and will not you forgive my\nfolly, and still love your motherless girl?\"\n\n\"That ye may count on,\" said Peter cheerfully.\n\n\"Oh, well, smile not. For then how can I speak and make you sad?\"\n\n\"Why, what is the matter?\"\n\n\"Father, disgrace is coming on this house: it is at the door. And I\nthe culprit. Oh, father, turn your head away. I--I--father, I have let\nGerard take away my marriage lines.\"\n\n\"Is that all? 'Twas an oversight.\"\n\n\"'Twas the deed of a mad woman. But woe is me! that is not the worst.\"\n\nPeter interrupted her. \"The youth is honest, and loves you dear. You are\nyoung. What is a year or two to you? Gerard will assuredly come back and\nkeep troth.\"\n\n\"And meantime know you what is coming?\"\n\n\"Not I, except that I shall be gone first for one.\"\n\n\"Worse than that. There is worse pain than death. Nay, for pity's sake\nturn away your head, father.\"\n\n\"Foolish wench!\" muttered Peter, but turned his head.\n\nShe trembled violently, and with her cheeks on fire began to falter out,\n\"I did look on Gerard as my husband--we being betrothed-and he was in so\nsore danger, and I thought I had killed him, and I-oh, if you were but\nmy mother I might find courage: you would question me. But you say not a\nword.\"\n\n\"Why, Margaret, what is all this coil about? and why are thy cheeks\ncrimson, speaking to no stranger', but to thy old father?\"\n\n\"Why are my cheeks on fire? Because--because--father kill me; send me\nto heaven! bid Martin shoot me with his arrow! And then the gossips will\ncome and tell you why I blush so this day. And then, when I am dead, I\nhope you will love your girl again for her mother's sake.\"\n\n\"Give me thy hand, mistress,\" said Peter, a little sternly.\n\nShe put it out to him trembling. He took it gently and began with some\nanxiety in his face to feel her pulse.\n\n\"Alas, nay,\" said she. \"'Tis my soul that burns, not my body, with\nfever. I cannot, will not, bide in Sevenbergen.\" And she wrung her hands\nimpatiently.\n\n\"Be calm now,\" said the old man soothingly, \"nor torment thyself for\nnought. Not bide in Sevenbergen? What need to bide a day, as it vexes\nthee, and puts thee in a fever: for fevered thou art, deny it not.\"\n\n\"What!\" cried Margaret, \"would you yield to go hence, and--and ask no\nreason but my longing to be gone?\" and suddenly throwing herself on her\nknees beside him, in a fervour of supplication she clutched his sleeve,\nand then his arm, and then his shoulder, while imploring him to quit\nthis place, and not ask her why. \"Alas! what needs it? You will soon see\nit. And I could never say it. I would liever die.\"\n\n\"Foolish child, who seeks thy girlish secrets? Is it I, whose life hath\nbeen spent in searching Nature's? And for leaving Sevenbergen, what is\nthere to keep me in it, thee unwilling? Is there respect for me here, or\ngratitude? Am I not yclept quacksalver by those that come not near me,\nand wizard by those I heal? And give they not the guerdon and the honour\nthey deny me to the empirics that slaughter them? Besides, what is't to\nme where we sojourn? Choose thou that, as did thy mother before thee.\"\n\nMargaret embraced him tenderly, and wept upon his shoulder.\n\nShe was respited.\n\nYet as she wept, respited, she almost wished she had had the courage to\ntell him.\n\nAfter a while nothing would content him but her taking a medicament he\nwent and brought her. She took it submissively, to please him. It\nwas the least she could do. It was a composing draught, and though\nadministered under an error, and a common one, did her more good than\nharm: she awoke calmed by a long sleep, and that very day began her\npreparations.\n\nNext week they went to Rotterdam, bag and baggage, and lodged above a\ntailor's shop in the Brede-Kirk Straet.\n\nOnly one person in Tergou knew whither they were gone.\n\nThe Burgomaster.\n\nHe locked the information in his own breast.\n\nThe use he made of it ere long, my reader will not easily divine: for he\ndid not divine it himself.\n\nBut time will show.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L\n\nAmong strangers Margaret Brandt was comparatively happy. And soon a new\nand unexpected cause of content arose. A civic dignitary being ill, and\nfanciful in proportion, went from doctor to doctor; and having arrived\nat death's door, sent for Peter. Peter found him bled and purged to\nnothing. He flung a battalion of bottles out of window, and left it\nopen; beat up yolks of eggs in neat Schiedam, and administered it in\nsmall doses; followed this up by meat stewed in red wine and water,\nshredding into both mild febrifugal herbs, that did no harm. Finally,\nhis patient got about again, looking something between a man and a\npillow-case, and being a voluble dignitary, spread Peter's fame in every\nstreet; and that artist, who had long merited a reputation in vain,\nmade one rapidly by luck. Things looked bright. The old man's pride was\ncheered at last, and his purse began to fill. He spent much of his gain,\nhowever, in sovereign herbs and choice drugs, and would have so invested\nthem all, but Margaret white-mailed a part. The victory came too late.\nIts happy excitement was fatal.\n\nOne evening, in bidding her good-night, his voice seemed rather\ninarticulate.\n\nThe next morning he was found speechless, and only just sensible.\n\nMargaret, who had been for years her father's attentive pupil, saw at\nonce that he had had a paralytic stroke. But not trusting to herself,\nshe ran for a doctor. One of those who, obstructed by Peter, had not\nkilled the civic dignitary, came, and cheerfully confirmed her views.\nHe was for bleeding the patient. She declined. \"He was always against\nblooding,\" said she, \"especially the old.\" Peter lived, but was never\nthe same man again. His memory became much affected, and of course he\nwas not to be trusted to prescribe; and several patients had come,\nand one or two, that were bent on being cured by the new doctor and no\nother, awaited his convalescence. Misery stared her in the face. She\nresolved to go for advice and comfort to her cousin William Johnson,\nfrom whom she had hitherto kept aloof out of pride and poverty. She\nfound him and his servant sitting in the same room, and neither of them\nthe better for liquor. Mastering all signs of surprise, she gave her\ngreetings, and presently told him she had come to talk on a family\nmatter, and with this glanced quietly at the servant by way of hint. The\nwoman took it, but not as expected.\n\n\"Oh, you can speak before me, can she not, my old man?\"\n\nAt this familiarity Margaret turned very red, and said--\n\n\"I cry you mercy, mistress. I knew not my cousin had fallen into the\ncustom of this town. Well, I must take a fitter opportunity;\" and she\nrose to go.\n\n\"I wot not what ye mean by custom o' the town,\" said the woman, bouncing\nup. \"But this I know; 'tis the part of a faithful servant to keep her\nmaster from being preyed on by his beggarly kin.\"\n\nMargaret retorted: \"Ye are too modest, mistress. Ye are no servant. Your\nspeech betrays you. 'Tis not till the ape hath mounted the tree that\nshe, shows her tail so plain. Nay, there sits the servant; God help him!\nAnd while so it is, fear not thou his kin will ever be so poor in spirit\nas come where the likes of you can flout their dole.\" And casting one\nlook of mute reproach at her cousin for being so little of a man as to\nsit passive and silent all this time, she turned and went haughtily out;\nnor would she shed a single tear till she got home and thought of it.\nAnd now here were two men to be lodged and fed by one pregnant girl; and\nanother mouth coming into the world.\n\nBut this last, though the most helpless of all, was their best friend.\n\nNature was strong in Margaret Brandt; that same nature which makes the\nbrutes, the birds, and the insects, so cunning at providing food and\nshelter for their progeny yet to come.\n\nStimulated by nature she sat and brooded, and brooded, and thought, and\nthought, how to be beforehand with destitution. Ay, though she had still\nfive gold pieces left, she saw starvation coming with inevitable foot.\n\nHer sex, when, deviating from custom, it thinks with male intensity,\nthinks just as much to the purpose as we do. She rose, bade Martin move\nPeter to another room, made her own very neat and clean, polished the\nglass globe, and suspended it from the ceiling, dusted the crocodile and\nnailed him to the outside wall; and after duly instructing Martin, set\nhim to play the lounging sentinel about the street door, and tell the\ncrocodile-bitten that a great, and aged, and learned alchymist abode\nthere, who in his moments of recreation would sometimes amuse himself by\ncuring mortal diseases.\n\nPatients soon came, and were received by Margaret, and demanded to see\nthe leech. \"That might not be. He was deep in his studies, searching for\nthe grand elixir, and not princes could have speech of him. They must\ntell her their symptoms, and return in two hours.\" And oh! mysterious\npowers! when they did return, the drug or draught was always ready for\nthem. Sometimes, when it was a worshipful patient, she would carefully\nscan his face, and feeling both pulse and skin, as well as hearing his\nstory, would go softly with it to Peter's room; and there think and\nask herself how her father, whose system she had long quietly observed,\nwould have treated the case. Then she would write an illegible scrawl\nwith a cabalistic letter, and bring it down reverently, and show it the\npatient, and \"Could he read that?\" Then it would be either, \"I am no\nreader,\" or, with admiration, \"Nay, mistress, nought can I make on't.\"\n\n\"Ay, but I can. 'Tis sovereign. Look on thyself as cured!\" If she had\nthe materials by her, and she was too good an economist not to favour\nsomewhat those medicines she had in her own stock, she would sometimes\nlet the patient see her compound it, often and anxiously consulting the\nsacred prescription lest great Science should suffer in her hands. And\nso she would send them away relieved of cash, but with their pockets\nfull of medicine, and minds full of faith, and humbugged to their\nhearts' content. Populus vult decipi. And when they were gone, she would\ntake down two little boxes Gerard had made her; and on one of these\nshe had written To-day, and on the other To-morrow, and put the smaller\ncoins into \"To-day,\" and the larger into \"To-morrow,\" along with such\nof her gold pieces as had survived the journey from Sevenbergen, and\nthe expenses of housekeeping in a strange place, and so she met current\nexpenses, and laid by for the rainy day she saw coming, and mixed drugs\nwith simples, and vice with virtue. On this last score her conscience\npricked her sore, and after each day's comedy, she knelt down and prayed\nGod to forgive her \"for the sake of her child.\" But lo and behold, cure\nand cure was reported to her; so then her conscience began to harden.\nMartin Wittenhaagen had of late been a dead weight on her hands. Like\nmost men who had endured great hardships, he had stiffened rather\nsuddenly. But though less supple, he was as strong as ever, and at his\nown pace could have carried the doctor herself round Rotterdam city. He\ncarried her slops instead.\n\nIn this new business he showed the qualities of a soldier: unreasoning\nobedience, punctuality, accuracy, despatch, and drunkenness.\n\nHe fell among \"good fellows;\" the blackguards plied him with Schiedam;\nhe babbled, he bragged.\n\nDoctor Margaret had risen very high in his estimation. All this\nbrandishing of a crocodile for a standard, and setting a dotard in\nambush, and getting rid of slops, and taking good money in exchange,\nstruck him not as Science but something far superior, Strategy. And he\nboasted in his cups and before a mixed company how \"me and my General we\nare a biting of the burghers.\"\n\nWhen this revelation had had time to leaven the city, his General,\nDoctor Margaret, received a call from the constables; they took her,\ntrembling and begging subordinate machines to forgive her, before the\nburgomaster; and by his side stood real physicians, a terrible row, in\nlong robes and square caps, accusing her of practising unlawfully on the\nbodies of the duke's lieges. At first she was too frightened to say\na word. Novice like, the very name of \"Law\" paralyzed her. But being\nquestioned closely, but not so harshly as if she had been ugly, she told\nthe truth; she had long been her father's pupil, and had but followed\nhis system, and she had cured many; \"and it is not for myself in very\ndeed, sirs, but I have two poor helpless honest men at home upon my\nhands, and how else can I keep them? Ah, good sirs, let a poor girl make\nher bread honestly; ye hinder them not to make it idly and shamefully;\nand oh, sirs, ye are husbands, ye are fathers; ye cannot but see I have\nreason to work and provide as best I may;\" and ere this woman's appeal\nhad left her lips, she would have given the world to recall it, and\nstood with one hand upon her heart and one before her face, hiding it,\nbut not the tears that trickled underneath it. All which went to the\nwrong address. Perhaps a female bailiff might have yielded to such\narguments, and bade her practise medicine, and break law, till such time\nas her child should be weaned, and no longer.\n\n\"What have we to do with that,\" said the burgomaster, \"save and except\nthat if thou wilt pledge thyself to break the law no more, I will remit\nthe imprisonment, and exact but the fine?\"\n\nOn this Doctor Margaret clasped her hands together, and vowed most\npenitently never, never, never to cure body or beast again; and being\ndismissed with the constables to pay the fine, she turned at the\ndoor, and curtsied, poor soul, and thanked the gentlemen for their\nforbearance.\n\nAnd to pay the fine the \"To-morrow box\" must be opened on the instant;\nand with excess of caution she had gone and nailed it up, that no slight\ntemptation might prevail to open it. And now she could not draw the\nnails, and the constables grew impatient, and doubted its contents, and\nsaid, \"Let us break it for you.\" But she would not let them. \"Ye will\nbreak it worse than I shall.\" And she took a hammer, and struck too\nfaintly, and lost all strength for a minute, and wept hysterically; and\nat last she broke it, and a little cry bubbled from her when it broke;\nand she paid the fine, and it took all her unlawful gains and two gold\npieces to boot; and when the men were gone, she drew the broken pieces\nof the box, and what little money they had left her, all together on the\ntable, and her arms went round them, and her rich hair escaped, and fell\ndown all loose, and she bowed her forehead on the wreck, and sobbed,\n\"My love's box it is broken, and my heart withal;\" and so remained. And\nMartin Wittenhaagen came in, and she could not lift her head, but sighed\nout to him what had befallen her, ending, \"My love his box is broken,\nand so mine heart is broken.\"\n\nAnd Martin was not so sad as wroth. Some traitor had betrayed him. What\nstony heart had told and brought her to this pass? Whoever it was should\nfeel his arrow's point. The curious attitude in which he must deliver\nthe shaft never occurred to him.\n\n\"Idle chat! idle chat!\" moaned Margaret, without lifting her brow from\nthe table. \"When you have slain all the gossips in this town, can we eat\nthem? Tell me how to keep you all, or prithee hold thy peace, and let\nthe saints get leave to whisper me.\" Martin held his tongue, and cast\nuneasy glances at his defeated General.\n\nTowards evening she rose, and washed her face and did up her hair,\nand doggedly bade Martin take down the crocodile, and put out a basket\ninstead.\n\n\"I can get up linen better than they seem to do it in this street,\" said\nshe, \"and you must carry it in the basket.\"\n\n\"That will I for thy sake,\" said the soldier.\n\n\"Good Martin! forgive me that I spake shrewishly to thee.\"\n\nEven while they were talking came a male for advice. Margaret told it\nthe mayor had interfered and forbidden her to sell drugs. \"But,\" said\nshe, \"I will gladly iron and starch your linen for you, and I will come\nand fetch it from your house.\"\n\n\"Are ye mad, young woman?\" said the male. \"I come for a leech, and ye\nproffer me a washerwoman;\" and it went out in dudgeon.\n\n\"There is a stupid creature,\" said Margaret sadly.\n\nPresently came a female to tell the symptoms of her sick child. Margaret\nstopped it.\n\n\"We are forbidden by the bailiff to sell drugs. But I will gladly wash,\niron, and starch your linen for you-and-I will come and fetch it from\nyour house.\"\n\n\"Oh, ay,\" said the female. \"Well, I have some smocks and ruffs foul.\nCome for them; and when you are there, you can look at the boy;\" and it\ntold her where it lived, and when its husband would be out; yet it was\nrather fond of its husband than not.\n\nAn introduction is an introduction. And two or three patients out of\nall those who came and were denied medicine made Doctor Margaret their\nwasherwoman.\n\n\"Now, Martin, you must help. I'll no more cats than can slay mice.\"\n\n\"Mistress, the stomach is not awanting for't, but the headpiece, worst\nluck.\"\n\n\"Oh! I mean not the starching and ironing; that takes a woman and a\nhandy one. But the bare washing; a man can surely contrive that. Why, a\nmule has wit enough in's head to do't with his hoofs, an' ye could drive\nhim into the tub. Come, off doublet, and try.\"\n\n\"I am your man,\" said the brave old soldier, stripping for the unwonted\ntoil. \"I'll risk my arm in soapsuds, an you will risk your glory.\"\n\n\"My what?\"\n\n\"Your glory and honour as a--washerwoman.\"\n\n\"Gramercy! if you are man enough to bring me half-washed linen t' iron,\nI am woman enough to fling't back i' the suds.\"\n\nAnd so the brave girl and the brave soldier worked with a will, and kept\nthe wolf from the door. More they could not do. Margaret had repaired\nthe \"To-morrow box,\" and as she leaned over the glue, her tears mixed\nwith it, and she cemented her exiled lover's box with them, at which a\nsmile is allowable, but an intelligent smile tipped with pity, please,\nand not the empty guffaw of the nineteenth-century-jackass, burlesquing\nBibles, and making fun of all things except fun. But when mended\nit stood unreplenished. They kept the weekly rent paid, and the pot\nboiling, but no more.\n\nAnd now came a concatenation. Recommended from one to another, Margaret\nwashed for the mayor. And bringing home the clean linen one day she\nheard in the kitchen that his worship's only daughter was stricken\nwith disease, and not like to live, Poor Margaret could not help\ncross-questioning, and a female servant gave her such of the symptoms as\nshe had observed. But they were too general. However, one gossip would\nadd one fact, and another another. And Margaret pondered them all.\n\nAt last one day she met the mayor himself. He recognized her directly.\n\"Why, you are the unlicensed doctor.\" \"I was,\" said she, \"but now I'm\nyour worship's washerwoman.\" The dignitary coloured, and said that was\nrather a come down. \"Nay, I bear no malice; for your worship might have\nbeen harder. Rather would I do you a good turn. Sir, you have a sick\ndaughter. Let me see her.\"\n\nThe mayor shook his head. \"That cannot be. The law I do enforce on\nothers I may not break myself.\" Margaret opened her eyes. \"Alack, sir, I\nseek no guerdon now for curing folk; why, I am a washerwoman. I trow one\nmay heal all the world, an if one will but let the world starve one in\nreturn.\" \"That is no more than just,\" said the mayor: he added, \"an' ye\nmake no trade on't, there is no offence.\" \"Then let me see her.\"\n\n\"What avails it? The learnedest leeches in Rotterdam have all seen her,\nand bettered her nought. Her ill is inscrutable. One skilled wight saith\nspleen; another, liver; another, blood; another, stomach; and another,\nthat she is possessed; and in very truth, she seems to have a demon;\nshunneth all company; pineth alone; eateth no more victuals than might\ndiet a sparrow. Speaketh seldom, nor hearkens them that speak, and\nweareth thinner and paler and nearer and nearer the grave, well-a-day.\"\n\"Sir,\" said Margaret, \"an if you take your velvet doublet to\nhalf-a-dozen of shops in Rotterdam, and speer is this fine or sorry\nvelvet, and worth how much the ell, those six traders will eye it and\nfeel it, and all be in one story to a letter. And why? Because they know\ntheir trade. And your leeches are all in different stories. Why? Because\nthey know not their trade. I have heard my father say each is enamoured\nof some one evil, and seeth it with his bat's eye in every patient. Had\nthey stayed at home, and never seen your daughter, they had answered all\nthe same, spleen, blood, stomach, lungs, liver, lunacy, or as they call\nit possession. Let me see her. We are of a sex, and that is much.\" And\nwhen he still hesitated, \"Saints of heaven!\" cried she, giving way to\nthe irritability of a breeding woman, \"is this how men love their own\nflesh and blood? Her mother had ta'en me in her arms ere this, and\ncarried me to the sick room.\" And two violet eyes flashed fire.\n\n\"Come with me,\" said the mayor hastily.\n\n\"Mistress, I have brought thee a new doctor.\"\n\nThe person addressed, a pale young girl of eighteen, gave a contemptuous\nwrench of her shoulder, and turned more decidedly to the fire she was\nsitting over.\n\nMargaret came softly and sat beside her. \"But 'tis one that will not\ntorment you.\n\n\"A woman!\" exclaimed the young lady, with surprise and some contempt.\n\n\"Tell her your symptoms.\"\n\n\"What for? you will be no wiser.\"\n\n\"You will be none the worse.\"\n\n\"Well, I have no stomach for food, and no heart for any thing. Now cure\nme, and go.\"\n\n\"Patience awhile! Your food, is it tasteless like in your mouth?\"\n\n\"Ay. How knew you that?\"\n\n\"Nay, I knew it not till you did tell me. I trow you would be better for\na little good company.\"\n\n\"I trow not. What is their silly chat to me?\"\n\nHere Margaret requested the father to leave them alone; and in his\nabsence put some practical questions. Then she reflected.\n\n\"When you wake i' the morning you find yourself quiver, as one may say?\"\n\n\"Nay. Ay. How knew you that?\"\n\n\"Shall I dose you, or shall I but tease you a bit with my silly chat?\"\n\n\"Which you will.\"\n\n\"Then I will tell you a story. 'Tis about two true lovers.\"\n\n\"I hate to hear of lovers,\" said the girl; \"nevertheless canst tell me,\n'twill be less nauseous than your physic--maybe.\"\n\nMargaret then told her a love story. The maiden was a girl called Ursel,\nand the youth one Conrad; she an old physician's daughter, he the son of\na hosier at Tergou. She told their adventures, their troubles, their sad\ncondition. She told it from the female point of view, and in a sweet and\nwinning and earnest voice, that by degrees soon laid hold of this sullen\nheart, and held it breathless; and when she broke it off her patient was\nmuch disappointed.\n\n\"Nay, nay, I must hear the end. I will hear it.\"\n\n\"Ye cannot, for I know it not; none knoweth that but God.\"\n\n\"Ah, your Ursel was a jewel of worth,\" said the girl earnestly. \"Would\nshe were here.\"\n\n\"Instead of her that is here?\"\n\n\"I say not that;\" and she blushed a little.\n\n\"You do but think it.\"\n\n\"Thought is free. Whether or no, an she were here, I'd give her a buss,\npoor thing.\"\n\n\"Then give it me, for I am she.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, that I'll be sworn y' are not.\"\n\n\"Say not so; in very truth I am she. And prithee, sweet mistress, go\nnot from your word, but give me the buss ye promised me, and with a good\nheart, for oh, my own heart lies heavy: heavy as thine, sweet mistress.\"\n\nThe young gentlewoman rose and put her arms round Margaret's neck and\nkissed her. \"I am woe for you,\" she sighed. \"You are a good soul; you\nhave done me good--a little.\" (A gulp came in her throat.) \"Come again!\ncome again!\"\n\nMargaret did come again, and talked with her, and gently, but keenly\nwatched what topics interested her, and found there was but one.\nThen she said to the mayor, \"I know your daughter's trouble, and 'tis\ncurable.\"\n\n\"What is't? the blood?\"\n\n\"Nay.\"\n\n\"The stomach?\"\n\n\"Nay.\"\n\n\"The liver?\"\n\n\"Nay.\"\n\n\"The foul fiend?\"\n\n\"Nay.\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Love.\"\n\n\"Love? stuff, impossible! She is but a child; she never stirs abroad\nunguarded. She never hath from a child.\"\n\n\"All the better; then we shall not have far to look for him.\"\n\n\"I vow not. I shall but command her to tell me the caitiff's name, that\nhath by magic arts ensnared her young affections.\"\n\n\"Oh, how foolish be the wise!\" said Margaret; \"what, would ye go and put\nher on her guard? Nay, let us work by art first; and if that fails, then\n'twill still be time for violence and folly.\"\n\nMargaret then with some difficulty prevailed on the mayor to take\nadvantage of its being Saturday, and pay all his people their salaries\nin his daughter's presence and hers.\n\nIt was done: some fifteen people entered the room, and received their\npay with a kind word from their employer. Then Margaret, who had sat\nclose to the patient all the time, rose and went out. The mayor followed\nher.\n\n\"Sir, how call you yon black-haired lad?\"\n\n\"That is Ulrich, my clerk.\"\n\n\"Well then, 'tis he.\"\n\n\"Now Heaven forbid a lad I took out of the streets.\"\n\n\"Well, but your worship is an understanding man. You took him not up\nwithout some merit of his?\"\n\n\"Merit? not a jot! I liked the looks of the brat, that was all.\"\n\n\"Was that no merit? He pleased the father's eye. And now who had pleased\nthe daughter's. That has oft been seen since Adam.\"\n\n\"How know ye 'tis he?\"\n\n\"I held her hand, and with my finger did lightly touch her wrist; and\nwhen the others came and went, 'twas as if dogs and cats had fared in\nand out. But at this Ulrich's coming her pulse did leap, and her eye\nshine; and when he went, she did sink back and sigh; and 'twas to be\nseen the sun had gone out of the room for her. Nay, burgomaster, look\nnot on me so scared: no witch or magician I, but a poor girl that hath\nbeen docile, and so bettered herself by a great neglected leech's art\nand learning. I tell ye all this hath been done before, thousands of\nyears ere we were born. Now bide thou there till I come to thee, and\nprithee, prithee, spoil not good work wi' meddling.\" She then went back\nand asked her patient for a lock of her hair.\n\n\"Take it,\" said she, more listlessly than ever.\n\n\"Why, 'tis a lass of marble. How long do you count to be like that,\nmistress?\"\n\n\"Till I am in my grave, sweet Peggy.\"\n\n\"Who knows? maybe in ten minutes you will be altogether as hot.\"\n\nShe ran into the shop, but speedily returned to the mayor and said,\n\"Good news! He fancies her and more than a little. Now how is't to be?\nWill you marry your child, or bury her, for there is no third way, for\nshame and love they do rend her virgin heart to death.\"\n\nThe dignitary decided for the more cheerful rite, but not without a\nstruggle; and with its marks on his face he accompanied Margaret to his\ndaughter. But as men are seldom in a hurry to drink their wormwood, he\nstood silent. So Doctor Margaret said cheerfully, \"Mistress, your lock\nis gone; I have sold it.\"\n\n\"And who was so mad as to buy such a thing?\" inquired the young lady\nscornfully.\n\n\"Oh, a black-haired laddie wi' white teeth. They call him Ulrich.\"\n\nThe pale face reddened directly, brow and all.\n\n\"Says he, 'Oh, sweet mistress, give it me.' I had told them all whose\n'twas. 'Nay,' said I, 'selling is my livelihood, not giving.' So he\noffered me this, he offered me that, but nought less would I take than\nhis next quarter's wages.\n\n\"Cruel,\" murmured the girl, scarce audibly.\n\n\"Why, you are in one tale with your father. Says he to me when I told\nhim, 'Oh, an he loves her hair so well, 'tis odd but he loves the rest\nof her. Well,' quoth he, ''tis an honest lad, and a shall have her, gien\nshe will but leave her sulks and consent.' So, what say ye, mistress,\nwill you be married to Ulrich, or buried i' the kirkyard?\"\n\n\"Father! father!\"\n\n\"'Tis so, girl, speak thy mind.\"\n\n\"I will obey my father--in all things,\" stammered the poor girl, trying\nhard to maintain the advantageous position in which Margaret had placed\nher. But nature, and the joy and surprise, were too strong even for a\nvirgin's bashful cunning. She cast an eloquent look on them both, and\nsank at her father's knees, and begged his pardon, with many sobs for\nhaving doubted his tenderness.\n\nHe raised her in his arms, and took her, radiant through her tears with\njoy, and returning life, and filial love, to his breast; and the pair\npassed a truly sacred moment, and the dignitary was as happy as he\nthought to be miserable; so hard is it for mortals to foresee. And they\nlooked round for Margaret, but she had stolen away softly.\n\nThe young girl searched the house for her.\n\n\"Where is she hid? Where on earth is she?\"\n\nWhere was she? why, in her own house, dressing meat for her two old\nchildren, and crying bitterly the while at the living picture of\nhappiness she had just created.\n\n\"Well-a-day, the odds between her lot and mine; well-a-day!\"\n\nNext time she met the dignitary he hemm'd and hawed, and remarked what\na pity it was the law forbade him to pay her who had cured his daughter.\n\"However, when all is done, 'twas not art, 'twas but woman's wit.\"\n\n\"Nought but that, burgomaster,\" said Margaret bitterly. \"Pay the men of\nart for not curing her: all the guerdon I seek, that cured her, is this:\ngo not and give your foul linen away from me by way of thanks.\"\n\n\"Why should I?\" inquired he.\n\n\"Marry, because there be fools about ye will tell ye she that hath wit\nto cure dark diseases, cannot have wit to take dirt out o' rags; so\npledge me your faith.\"\n\nThe dignitary promised pompously, and felt all the patron.\n\n\nSomething must be done to fill \"To-morrow's\" box. She hawked her initial\nletters and her illuminated vellums all about the town. Printing had by\nthis time dealt caligraphy in black and white a terrible blow in\nHolland and Germany. But some copies of the printed books were usually\nilluminated and fettered. The printers offered Margaret prices for work\nin these two kinds.\n\n\"I'll think on't,\" said she.\n\nShe took down her diurnal book, and calculated that the price of an\nhour's work on those arts would be about one-fifth what she got for an\nhour at the tub and mangle. \"I'll starve first,\" said she; \"what, pay a\ncraft and a mystery five times less than a handicraft!\"\n\nMartin, carrying the dry clothes-basket, got treated, and drunk. This\ntime he babbled her whole story. The girls got hold of it and gibed her\nat the fountain.\n\nAll she had gone through was light to her, compared with the pins and\nbodkins her own sex drove into her heart, whenever she came near the\nmerry crew with her pitcher, and that was every day. Each sex has its\nform of cruelty; man's is more brutal and terrible; but shallow women,\nthat have neither read nor suffered, have an unmuscular barbarity of\ntheir own (where no feeling of sex steps in to overpower it). This\ndefect, intellectual perhaps rather than moral, has been mitigated in\nour day by books, especially by able works of fiction; for there are\ntwo roads to the highest effort of intelligence, Pity; Experience of\nsorrows, and Imagination, by which alone we realize the grief we\nnever felt. In the fifteenth century girls with pitchers had but one;\nExperience; and at sixteen years of age or so, that road had scarce been\ntrodden. These girls persisted that Margaret was deserted by her lover.\nAnd to be deserted was a crime (They had not been deserted yet.) Not a\nword against the Gerard they had created out of their own heads. For the\nimaginary crime they fell foul of the supposed victim. Sometimes they\naffronted her to her face. Oftener they talked at her backwards and\nforwards with a subtle skill, and a perseverance which, \"oh, that they\nhad bestowed on the arts,\" as poor Aguecheek says.\n\nNow Margaret was brave, and a coward; brave to battle difficulties and\nill fortune; brave to shed her own blood for those she loved. Fortitude\nshe had. But she had no true fighting courage. She was a powerful young\nwoman, rather tall, full, and symmetrical; yet had one of those slips\nof girls slapped her face, the poor fool's hands would have dropped\npowerless, or gone to her own eyes instead of her adversary's. Nor was\nshe even a match for so many tongues; and besides, what could she say?\nShe knew nothing of these girls, except that somehow they had found out\nher sorrows, and hated her; only she thought to herself they must be\nvery happy, or they would not be so hard on her.\n\nSo she took their taunts in silence; and all her struggle was not to let\nthem see their power to make her writhe within.\n\nHere came in her fortitude; and she received their blows with\nwell-feigned, icy hauteur. They slapped a statue.\n\nBut one day, when her spirits were weak, as happens at times to females\nin her condition, a dozen assailants followed suit so admirably, that\nher whole sex seemed to the dispirited one to be against her, and she\nlost heart, and the tears began to run silently at each fresh stab.\n\nOn this their triumph knew no bounds, and they followed her half way\nhome casting barbed speeches.\n\nAfter that exposure of weakness the statue could be assumed no more. So\nthen she would stand timidly aloof out of tongue-shot, till her young\ntyrants' pitchers were all filled, and they gone; and then creep up with\nhers. And one day she waited so long that the fount had ceased to flow.\nSo the next day she was obliged to face the phalanx, or her house go\ndry. She drew near slowly, but with the less tremor, that she saw a\nman at the well talking to them. He would distract their attention, and\nbesides, they would keep their foul tongues quiet if only to blind\nthe male to their real character. This conjecture, though shrewd, was\nerroneous. They could not all flirt with that one man; so the outsiders\nindemnified themselves by talking at her the very moment she came up.\n\n\"Any news from foreign parts, Jacqueline?\"\n\n\"None for me, Martha. My lad goes no farther from me than the town\nwall.\"\n\n\"I can't say as much,\" says a third.\n\n\"But if he goes t' Italy I have got another ready to take the fool's\nplace.\"\n\n\"He'll not go thither, lass. They go not so far till they are sick of us\nthat bide in Holland.\"\n\nSurprise and indignation, and the presence of a man, gave Margaret a\nmoment's fighting courage.\n\n\"Oh, flout me not, and show your ill nature before the very soldier. In\nHeaven's name, what ill did I ever to ye? what harsh word cast back, for\nall you have flung on me, a desolate stranger in your cruel town,\nthat ye flout me for my bereavement and my poor lad's most unwilling\nbanishment? Hearts of flesh would surely pity us both, for that ye cast\nin my teeth these many days, ye brows of brass, ye bosoms of stone.\"\n\nThey stared at this novelty, resistance; and ere they could recover and\nmake mincement of her, she put her pitcher quietly down, and threw her\ncoarse apron over her head, and stood there grieving, her short-lived\nspirit oozing fast. \"Hallo!\" cried the soldier, \"why, what is your ill?\"\nShe made no reply. But a little girl, who had long secretly hated the\nbig ones, squeaked out, \"They did flout her, they are aye flouting her;\nshe may not come nigh the fountain for fear o' them, and 'tis a black\nshame.\"\n\n\"Who spoke to her! Not I for one.\"\n\n\"Nor I. I would not bemean myself so far.\"\n\nThe man laughed heartily at this display of dignity. \"Come, wife,\" said\nhe, \"never lower thy flag to such light skirmishers as these. Hast a\ntongue i' thy head as well as they.\"\n\n\"Alack, good soldier, I was not bred to bandy foul terms.\"\n\n\"Well, but hast a better arm than these. Why not take 'em by twos across\nthy knee, and skelp 'em till they cry Meculpee?\"\n\n\"Nay, I would not hurt their bodies for all their cruel hearts.\"\n\n\"Then ye must e'en laugh at them, wife. What! a woman grown, and not\nsee why mesdames give tongue? You are a buxom wife; they are a bundle of\nthread-papers. You are fair and fresh; they have all the Dutch rim under\ntheir bright eyes, that comes of dwelling in eternal swamps. There lies\nyour crime. Come, gie me thy pitcher, and if they flout me, shalt see\nme scrub 'em all wi' my beard till they squeak holy mother.\" The\npitcher was soon filled, and the soldier put it in Margaret's hand. She\nmurmured, \"Thank you kindly, brave soldier.\"\n\nHe patted her on the shoulder. \"Come, courage, brave wife; the divell\nis dead!\" She let the heavy pitcher fall on his foot directly. He cursed\nhorribly, and hopped in a circle, saying, \"No, the Thief's alive and has\nbroken my great toe.\"\n\nThe apron came down, and there was a lovely face all flushed with'\nemotion, and two beaming eyes in front of him, and two hands held out\nclasped.\n\n\"Nay, nay, 'tis nought,\" said he good-humouredly, mistaking.\n\n\"Denys?\"\n\n\"Well?--But--Hallo! How know you my name is--\"\n\n\"Denys of Burgundy!\"\n\n\"Why, ods bodikins! I know you not, and you know me.\"\n\n\"By Gerard's letter. Crossbow! beard! handsome! The divell is dead.\"\n\n\"Sword of Goliah! this must be she. Red hair, violet eyes, lovely face.\nBut I took ye for a married wife, seeing ye---\"\n\n\"Tell me my name,\" said she quickly.\n\n\"Margaret Brandt.\"\n\n\"Gerard? Where is he? Is he in life? Is he well? Is he coming? Is he\ncome? Why is he not here? Where have ye left him? Oh tell me! prithee,\nprithee, prithee, tell me!\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, but not here. Oh, ye are all curiosity now, mesdames, eh? Lass,\nI have been three months a-foot travelling all Holland to find ye,\nand here you are. Oh, be joyful!\" and he flung his cap in the air, and\nseizing both her hands kissed them ardently. \"Ah, my pretty she-comrade,\nI have found thee at last. I knew I should. Shall be flouted no more.\nI'll twist your necks at the first word, ye little trollops. And I have\ngot fifteen gold angels left for thee, and our Gerard will soon be here.\nShalt wet thy purple eyes no more.\"\n\nBut the fair eyes were wet even now, looking kindly and gratefully at\nthe friend that had dropped among her foes as if from heaven; Gerard's\ncomrade. \"Prithee come home with me good, kind Denys. I cannot speak of\nhim before these.\" They went off together, followed by a chorus. \"She\nhas gotten a man. She has gotten a man at last. Boo! boo! boo!\"\n\nMargaret quickened her steps; but Denys took down his crossbow and\npretended to shoot them all dead: they fled quadrivious, shrieking.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI\n\nThe reader already knows how much these two had to tell one another.\nIt was a sweet yet bitter day for Margaret, since it brought her a true\nfriend, and ill news; for now first she learned that Gerard was all\nalone in that strange land. She could not think with Denys that he would\ncome home; indeed he would have arrived before this.\n\nDenys was a balm. He called her his she-comrade, and was always cheering\nher up with his formula and hilarities, and she petted him and made\nmuch of him, and feebly hectored it over him as well as over Martin, and\nwould not let him eat a single meal out of her house, and forbade him to\nuse naughty words. \"It spoils you, Denys. Good lack, to hear such ugly\nwords come forth so comely a head: forbear, or I shall be angry: so be\ncivil.\" Whereupon Denys was upon his good behaviour, and ludicrous the\nstruggle between his native politeness and his acquired ruffianism. And\nas it never rains but it pours, other persons now solicited Margaret's\nfriendship. She had written to Margaret Van Eyck a humble letter telling\nher she knew she was no longer the favourite she had been, and would\nkeep her distance; but could not forget her benefactress's past\nkindness. She then told her briefly how many ways she had battled for a\nliving, and in conclusion, begged earnestly that her residence might not\nbe betrayed, \"least of all to his people. I do hate them, they drove\nhim from me. And even when he was gone, their hearts turned not to me as\nthey would an if they had repented their cruelty to him.\"\n\nThe Van Eyck was perplexed. At last she made a confidante of Reicht. The\nsecret ran through Reicht, as through a cylinder, to Catherine.\n\n\"Ay, and is she turned that bitter against us?\" said that good woman.\n\"She stole our son from us, and now she hates us for not running into\nher arms. Natheless it is a blessing she is alive and no farther away\nthan Rotterdam.\"\n\nThe English princess, now Countess Charolois, made a stately\nprogress through the northern states of the duchy, accompanied by her\nstepdaughter the young heiress of Burgundy, Marie de Bourgogne. Then the\nold duke, the most magnificent prince in Europe, put out his splendour.\nTroops of dazzling knights, and bevies of fair ladies gorgeously\nattired, attended the two princesses; and minstrels, jongleurs, or\nstory-tellers, bards, musicians, actors, tumblers followed in the train;\nand there was fencing, dancing, and joy in every town they shone on.\nRichart invited all his people to meet him at Rotterdam and view the\npageant.\n\nThey had been in Rotterdam some days, when Denys met Catherine\naccidentally in the street, and after a warm greeting on both sides,\nbade her rejoice, for he had found the she-comrade, and crowed; but\nCatherine cooled him by showing him how much earlier he would have found\nher by staying quietly at Tergou, than by vagabondizing it all over\nHolland. \"And being found, what the better are we? her heart is set dead\nagainst us now.\"\n\n\"Oh, let that flea stick; come you with me to her house.\"\n\nNo, she would not go where she was sure of an ill welcome. \"Them that\ncome unbidden sit unseated.\" No, let Denys be mediator, and bring the\nparties to a good understanding. He undertook the office at once, and\nwith great pomp and confidence. He trotted off to Margaret and said,\n\"She-comrade, I met this day a friend of thine.\"\n\n\"Thou didst look into the Rotter then, and see thyself.\"\n\n\"Nay, 'twas a female, and one that seeks thy regard; 'twas Catherine,\nGerard's mother.\"\n\n\"Oh, was it?\" said Margaret; \"then you may tell her she comes too late.\nThere was a time I longed and longed for her; but she held aloof in my\nhour of most need, so now we will be as we ha' been.\"\n\nDenys tried to shake this resolution. He coaxed her, but she was bitter\nand sullen, and not to be coaxed. Then he scolded her well; then, at\nthat she went into hysterics.\n\nHe was frightened at this result of his eloquence, and being off his\nguard, allowed himself to be entrapped into a solemn promise never to\nrecur to the subject. He went back to Catherine crestfallen, and\ntold her. She fired up and told the family how his overtures had been\nreceived. Then they fired up; it became a feud and burned fiercer every\nday. Little Kate alone made some excuses for Margaret.\n\nThe very next day another visitor came to Margaret, and found the\nmilitary enslaved and degraded, Martin up to his elbows in soapsuds,\nand Denys ironing very clumsily, and Margaret plaiting ruffs, but with\na mistress's eye on her raw levies. To these there entered an old man,\nvenerable at first sight, but on nearer view keen and wizened.\n\n\"Ah,\" cried Margaret. Then swiftly turned her back on him and hid her\nface with invincible repugnance. \"Oh, that man! that man!\"\n\n\"Nay, fear me not,\" said Ghysbrecht; \"I come on a friend's errand. I\nbring ye a letter from foreign parts.\"\n\n\"Mock me not, old man,\" and she turned slowly round.\n\n\"Nay, see;\" and he held out an enormous letter.\n\nMargaret darted on it, and held it with trembling hands and glistening\neyes. It was Gerard's handwriting.\n\n\"Oh, thank you, sir, bless you for this, I forgive you all the ill you\never wrought me.\"\n\nAnd she pressed the letter to her bosom with one hand, and glided\nswiftly from the room with it.\n\nAs she did not come back, Ghysbrecht went away, but not without a scowl\nat Martha. Margaret was hours alone with her letter.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI\n\nWhen she came down again she was a changed woman. Her eyes were wet, but\ncalm, and all her bitterness and excitement charmed away.\n\n\"Denys,\" said she softly, \"I have got my orders. I am to read my lover's\nletter to his folk.\"\n\n\"Ye will never do that?\"\n\n\"Ay will I.\"\n\n\"I see there is something in the letter has softened ye towards them.\"\n\n\"Not a jot, Denys, not a jot. But an I hated them like poison I would\nnot disobey my love. Denys, 'tis so sweet to obey, and sweetest of all\nto obey one who is far, far away, and cannot enforce my duty, but must\ntrust my love for my obedience. Ah, Gerard, my darling, at hand I might\nhave slighted thy commands, misliking thy folk as I have cause to do;\nbut now, didst bid me go into the raging sea and read thy sweet letter\nto the sharks, there I'd go. Therefore, Denys, tell his mother I have\ngot a letter, and if she and hers would hear it, I am their servant; let\nthem say their hour, and I'll seat them as best I can, and welcome them\nas best I may.\"\n\nDenys went off to Catherine with this good news. He found the family at\ndinner, and told them there was a long letter from Gerard. Then in the\nmidst of the joy this caused, he said, \"And her heart is softened, and\nshe will read it to you herself; you are to choose your own time.\"\n\n\"What does she think there are none can read but her?\" asked Catherine.\n\"Let her send the letter and we will read it.\"\n\n\"Nay, but, mother,\" objected little Kate; \"mayhap she cannot bear to\npart it from her hand; she loves him dearly.\"\n\n\"What, thinks she we shall steal it?\"\n\nCornelis suggested that she would fain wedge herself into the family by\nmeans of this letter.\n\nDenys cast a look of scorn on the speaker. \"There spoke a bad heart,\"\nsaid he. \"La camarade hates you all like poison. Oh, mistake me not,\ndame; I defend her not, but so 'tis; yet maugre her spleen at a word\nfrom Gerard she proffers to read you his letter with her own pretty\nmouth, and hath a voice like honey--sure 'tis a fair proffer.\"\n\n\"'Tis so, mine honest soldier,\" said the father of the family, \"and\nmerits a civil reply, therefore hold your whisht ye that be women, and\nI shall answer her. Tell her I, his father, setting aside all past\ngrudges, do for this grace thank her, and would she have double thanks,\nlet her send my son's letter by thy faithful hand, the which will I\nread to his flesh and blood, and will then to her so surely and faithful\nreturn, as I am Eli a Dierich a William a Luke, free burgher of Tergou,\nlike my forbears, and like them, a man of my word.\"\n\n\"Ay, and a man who is better than his word,\" cried Catherine; \"the only\none I ever did foregather.\"\n\n\"Hold thy peace, wife.\"\n\n\"Art a man of sense, Eli, a dirk, a chose, a chose(1),\"' shouted Denys.\n\"The she-comrade will be right glad to obey Gerard and yet not face you\nall, whom she hates as wormwood, saving your presence. Bless ye, the\nworld hath changed, she is all submission to-day: 'obedience is honey,'\nquoth she; and in sooth 'tis a sweetmeat she cannot but savour, eating\nso little on't, for what with her fair face, and her mellow tongue; and\nwhat wi' flying in fits and terrifying us that be soldiers to death, an\nwe thwart her; and what wi' chiding us one while, and petting us like\nlambs t' other, she hath made two of the crawlingest slaves ever you\nsaw out of two honest swashbucklers. I be the ironing ruffian, t' other\nwashes.\"\n\n\"What next?\n\n\"What next? why, whenever the brat is in the world I shall rock cradle,\nand t' other knave will wash tucker and bib. So, then, I'll go fetch\nthe letter on the instant. Ye will let me bide and hear it read, will ye\nnot?\"\n\n\"Else our hearts were black as coal,\" said Catherine.\n\nSo Denys went for the letter. He came back crestfallen. \"She will not\nlet it out of her hand neither to me nor you, nor any he or she that\nlives.\"\n\n\"I knew she would not,\" said Cornelis.\n\n\"Whisht! whisht!\" said Eli, \"and let Denys tell his story.\"\n\n\"'Nay,' said I, 'but be ruled by me.' 'Not I,' quoth she. 'Well, but,'\nquoth I, 'that same honey Obedience ye spake of.' 'You are a fool,' says\nshe; 'obedience to Gerard is sweet, but obedience to any other body, who\never said that was sweet?'\n\n\"At last she seemed to soften a bit, and did give me a written paper for\nyou, mademoiselle. Here 'tis.\"\n\n\"For me?\" said little Kate, colouring.\n\n\"Give that here!\" said Eli, and he scanned the writing, and said almost\nin a whisper, \"These be words from the letter Hearken!\n\n\"'And, sweetheart, an if these lines should travel safe to thee, make\nthou trial of my people's hearts withal. Maybe they are somewhat turned\ntowards me, being far away. If 'tis so they will show it to thee, since\nnow to me they may not. Read, then, this letter! But I do strictly\nforbid thee to let it from thy hand; and if they still hold aloof from\nthee, why, then say nought, but let them think me dead. Obey me in\nthis; for, if thou dost disrespect my judgment and my will in this, thou\nlovest me not.'\"\n\nThere was a silence, and Gerard's words copied by Margaret here handed\nround and inspected.\n\n\"Well,\" said Catherine, \"that is another matter. But methinks 'tis for\nher to come to us, not we to her.\"\n\n\"Alas, mother! what odds does that make?\"\n\n\"Much,\" said Eli. \"Tell her we are over many to come to her, and bid her\nhither, the sooner the better.\"\n\nWhen Denys was gone, Eli owned it was a bitter pill to him.\n\n\"When that lass shall cross my threshold, all the mischief and misery\nshe hath made here will seem to come in adoors in one heap. But what\ncould I do, wife? We must hear the news of Gerard. I saw that in thine\neyes, and felt it in my own heart. And she is backed by our undutiful\nbut still beloved son, and so is she stronger than we, and brings our\nnoses down to the grindstone, the sly, cruel jade. But never heed.\nWe will hear the letter; and then let her go unblessed as she came\nunwelcome.\"\n\n\"Make your mind easy,\" said Catherine. \"She will not come at all.\" And a\ntone of regret was visible.\n\nShortly after Richart, who had been hourly expected, arrived from\nAmsterdam grave and dignified in his burgher's robe and gold chain,\nruff, and furred cap, and was received not with affection only, but\nrespect; for he had risen a step higher than his parents, and such steps\nwere marked in mediaeval society almost as visibly as those in their\nstaircases.\n\nAdmitted in due course to the family council, he showed plainly, though\nnot discourteously, that his pride was deeply wounded by their having\ndeigned to treat with Margaret Brandt. \"I see the temptation,\" said he.\n\"But which of us hath not at times to wish one way and do another?\" This\nthrew a considerable chill over the old people. So little Kate put in a\nword. \"Vex not thyself, dear Richart. Mother says she will not come.\n\n\"All the better, sweetheart. I fear me, if she do, I shall hie me back\nto Amsterdam.\"\n\nHere Denys popped his head in at the door, and said--\n\n\"She will be here at three on the great dial.\"\n\nThey all looked at one another in silence.\n\n     (1) Anglice, a Thing-em-bob.\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII\n\n\"Nay, Richart,\" said Catherine at last, \"for Heaven's sake let not this\none sorry wench set us all by the ears: hath she not made ill blood\nenough already?\"\n\n\"In very deed she hath. Fear me not, good mother. Let her come and read\nthe letter of the poor boy she hath by devilish arts bewitched and then\nlet her go. Give me your words to show her no countenance beyond decent\nand constrained civility: less we may not, being in our own house; and\nI will say no more.\" On this understanding they waited the foe. She, for\nher part, prepared for the interview in a spirit little less hostile.\nWhen Denys brought word they would not come to her, but would receive\nher, her lip curled, and she bade him observe how in them every feeling,\nhowever small, was larger than the love for Gerard. \"Well,\" said she, \"I\nhave not that excuse; so why mimic the pretty burgher's pride, the pride\nof all unlettered folk? I will go to them for Gerard's sake. Oh, how I\nloathe them!\"\n\nThus poor good-natured Denys was bringing into one house the materials\nof an explosion.\n\nMargaret made her toilet in the same spirit that a knight of her day\ndressed for battle--he to parry blows, and she to parry glances--glances\nof contempt at her poverty, or of irony at her extravagance. Her kirtle\nwas of English cloth, dark blue, and her farthingale and hose of the\nsame material, but a glossy roan, or claret colour. Not an inch of\npretentious fur about her, but plain snowy linen wristbands, and\ncuriously plaited linen from the bosom of the kirtle up to the\ncommencement of the throat; it did not encircle her throat, but framed\nit, being square, not round. Her front hair still peeped in two waves\nmuch after the fashion which Mary Queen of Scots revived a century\nlater; but instead of the silver net, which would have ill become her\npresent condition, the rest of her head was covered with a very small\ntight-fitting hood of dark blue cloth, hemmed with silver. Her shoes\nwere red; but the roan petticoat and hose prepared the spectator's mind\nfor the shock, and they set off the arched instep and shapely foot.\n\nBeauty knew its business then as now.\n\nAnd with all this she kept her enemies waiting, though it was three by\nthe dial.\n\nAt last she started, attended by her he-comrade. And when they were\nhalfway, she stopped and said thoughtfully, \"Denys!\"\n\n\"Well, she-general?\"\n\n\"I must go home\" (piteously).\n\n\"What, have ye left somewhat behind?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"My courage. Oh! oh! oh!\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, be brave, she-general. I shall be with you.\"\n\n\"Ay, but wilt keep close to me when I be there?\"\n\nDenys promised, and she resumed her march, but gingerly.\n\nMeantime they were all assembled, and waiting for her with a strange\nmixture of feelings.\n\nMortification, curiosity, panting affection, aversion to her who came to\ngratify those feelings, yet another curiosity to see what she was like,\nand what there was in her to bewitch Gerard and make so much mischief.\n\nAt last Denys came alone, and whispered, \"The she-comrade is without.\"\n\n\"Fetch her in,\" said Eli. \"Now whisht, all of ye. None speak to her but\nI.\"\n\nThey all turned their eyes to the door in dead silence.\n\nA little muttering was heard outside; Denys's rough organ and a woman's\nsoft and mellow voice.\n\nPresently that stopped; and then the door opened slowly, and Margaret\nBrandt, dressed as I have described, and somewhat pale, but calm and\nlovely, stood on the threshold, looking straight before her.\n\nThey all rose but Kate, and remained mute and staring.\n\n\"Be seated, mistress,\" said Eli gravely, and motioned to a seat that had\nbeen set apart for her.\n\nShe inclined her head, and crossed the apartment; and in so doing her\ncondition was very visible, not only in her shape, but in her languor.\n\nCornelis and Sybrandt hated her for it. Richart thought it spoiled her\nbeauty.\n\nIt softened the women somewhat.\n\nShe took her letter out of her bosom, and kissed it as if she had been\nalone; then disposed herself to read it, with the air of one who knew\nshe was there for that single purpose.\n\nBut as she began, she noticed they had seated her all by herself like a\nleper. She looked at Denys, and putting her hand down by her side, made\nhim a swift furtive motion to come by her.\n\nHe went with an obedient start as if she had cried \"March!\" and stood\nat her shoulder like a sentinel; but this zealous manner of doing it\nrevealed to the company that he had been ordered thither; and at that\nshe coloured. And now she began to read her Gerard, their Gerard, to\ntheir eager ears, in a mellow, clear voice, so soft, so earnest, so\nthrilling, her very soul seemed to cling about each precious sound. It\nwas a voice as of a woman's bosom set speaking by Heaven itself.\n\n\"I do nothing doubt, my Margaret, that long ere this shall meet thy\nbeloved eyes, Denys, my most dear friend, will have sought thee out,\nand told thee the manner of our unlooked for and most tearful parting.\nTherefore I will e'en begin at that most doleful day. What befell him\nafter, poor faithful soul, fain, fain would I hear, but may not. But I\npray for him day and night next after thee, dearest. Friend more stanch\nand loving had not David in Jonathan, than I in him. Be good to him, for\npoor Gerard's sake.\"\n\nAt these words, which came quite unexpectedly to him, Denys leaned his\nhead on Margaret's high chair, and groaned aloud.\n\nShe turned quickly as she sat, and found his hand, and pressed it.\n\nAnd so the sweetheart and the friend held hands while the sweetheart\nread.\n\n\"I went forward all dizzied, like one in an ill dream; and presently a\ngentleman came up with his servants, all on horseback, and had liked to\nhave rid o'er me. And he drew rein at the brow of the hill, and sent\nhis armed men back to rob me. They robbed me civilly enough and took my\npurse and the last copper, and rid gaily away. I wandered stupid on, a\nfriendless pauper.\"\n\nThere was a general sigh, followed by an oath from Denys.\n\n\"Presently a strange dimness came o'er me; I lay down to sleep on the\nsnow. 'Twas ill done, and with store of wolves hard by. Had I loved thee\nas thou dost deserve, I had shown more manhood. But oh, sweet love, the\ndrowsiness that did crawl o'er me desolate, and benumb me, was more than\nnature. And so I slept; and but that God was better to us, than I to\nthee or to myself, from that sleep I ne'er had waked; so all do say.\nI had slept an hour or two, as I suppose, but no more, when a hand did\nshake me rudely. I awoke to my troubles. And there stood a servant girl\nin her holiday suit. 'Are ye mad,' quoth she, in seeming choler, 'to\nsleep in snow, and under wolves' nosen? Art weary o' life, and not long\nweaned? Come, now, said she, more kindly, 'get up like a good lad;' so\nI did rise up. 'Are ye rich, or are ye poor?' But I stared at her as one\namazed. 'Why, 'tis easy of reply,' quoth she. 'Are ye rich, or are ye\npoor?' Then I gave a great, loud cry; that she did start back. 'Am I\nrich, or am I poor? Had ye asked me an hour agone, I had said I am rich.\nBut now I am so poor as sure earth beareth on her bosom none poorer.\nAn hour agone I was rich in a friend, rich in money, rich in hope and\nspirits of youth; but now the Bastard of Burgundy hath taken my friend,\nand another gentleman my purse; and I can neither go forward to Rome nor\nback to her I left in Holland. I am poorest of the poor.' 'Alack!' said\nthe wench. 'Natheless, an ye had been rich ye might ha' lain down again\nin the snow for any use I had for ye; and then I trow ye had soon fared\nout o' this world as bare as ye came into it. But, being poor, you are\nour man: so come wi' me.' Then I went because she bade me, and because I\nrecked not now whither I went. And she took me to a fine house hard by,\nand into a noble dining-hall hung with black; and there was set a table\nwith many dishes, and but one plate and one chair. 'Fall to!' said she,\nin a whisper. 'What, alone?' said I. 'Alone? And which of us, think ye,\nwould eat out of the same dish with ye? Are we robbers o' the dead?'\nThen she speered where I was born. 'At Tergou,' said I. Says she, 'And\nwhen a gentleman dies in that country, serve they not the dead man's\ndinner up as usual, till he be in the ground, and set some poor man to\nit?' I told her, 'nay.' She blushed for us then. Here they were better\nChristians.' So I behoved to sit down. But small was my heart for meat.\nThen this kind lass sat by me and poured me out wine; and tasting it,\nit cut me to the heart Denys was not there to drink with me. He doth so\nlove good wine, and women good, bad, or indifferent. The rich, strong\nwine curled round my sick heart; and that day first I did seem to\nglimpse why folk in trouble run to drink so. She made me eat of every\ndish. ''Twas unlucky to pass one. Nought was here but her master's daily\ndinner.' 'He had a good stomach, then,' said I. 'Ay, lad, and a good\nheart. Leastways, so we all say now he is dead; but, being alive, no\nword on't e'er heard I.' So I did eat as a bird, nibbling of every dish.\nAnd she hearing me sigh, and seeing me like to choke at the food, took\npity and bade me be of good cheer. I should sup and lie there that\nnight. And she went to the hind, and he gave me a right good bed; and I\ntold him all, and asked him would the law give me back my purse. 'Law!'\nquoth he; 'law there was none for the poor in Burgundy. Why, 'twas the\ncousin of the Lady of the Manor, he that had robbed me. He knew the\nwild spark. The matter must be judged before the lady; and she was quite\nyoung, and far more like to hang me for slandering her cousin, and a\ngentleman, and a handsome man, than to make him give me back my own.\nInside the liberties of a town a poor man might now and then see the\nface of justice; but out among the grand seigneurs and dames--never.'\nSo I said, 'I'll sit down robbed rather than seek justice and find\ngallows.' They were all most kind to me next day; and the girl proffered\nme money from her small wage to help me towards Rhine.\"\n\n\"Oh, then, he is coming home! he is coming home!\" shouted Denys,\ninterrupting the reader. She shook her head gently at him, by way of\nreproof.\n\n\"I beg pardon, all the company,\" said he stiffly.\n\n\"'Twas a sore temptation; but being a servant, my stomach rose against\nit. 'Nay, nay,' said I. She told me I was wrong. ''Twas pride out o'\nplace; poor folk should help one another; or who on earth would?' I said\nif I could do aught in return 'twere well; but for a free gift, nay: I\nwas overmuch beholden already. Should I write a letter for her? 'Nay, he\nis in the house at present,' said she. 'Should I draw her picture, and\nso earn my money?' 'What, can ye?' said she. I told her I could try; and\nher habit would well become a picture. So she was agog to be limned, and\ngive it her lad. And I set her to stand in a good light, and soon made\nsketches two, whereof I send thee one, coloured at odd hours. The other\nI did most hastily, and with little conscience daub, for which may\nHeaven forgive me; but time was short. They, poor things, knew no\nbetter, and were most proud and joyous; and both kissing me after their\ncountry fashion, 'twas the hind that was her sweetheart, they did bid me\nGod-speed; and I towards Rhine.\"\n\nMargaret paused here, and gave Denys the coloured drawing to hand round.\nIt was eagerly examined by the females on account of the costume, which\ndiffered in some respects from that of the Dutch domestic: the hair was\nin a tight linen bag, a yellow half kerchief crossed her head from ear\nto ear, but threw out a rectangular point that descended the centre of\nher forehead, and it met in two more points over her bosom. She wore a\nred kirtle with long sleeves, kilted very high in front, and showing a\ngreen farthingale and a great red leather purse hanging down over it;\nred stockings, yellow leathern shoes, ahead of her age; for they were\nlow-quartered and square-toed, secured by a strap buckling over the\ninstep, which was not uncommon, and was perhaps the rude germ of the\ndiamond buckle to come.\n\nMargaret continued:--\n\n\"But oh! how I missed my Denys at every step! often I sat down on the\nroad and groaned. And in the afternoon it chanced that I did so set me\ndown where two roads met, and with heavy head in hand, and heavy heart,\ndid think of thee, my poor sweetheart, and of my lost friend, and of the\nlittle house at Tergou, where they all loved me once; though now it is\nturned to hate.\"\n\nCatherine. \"Alas! that he will think so.\"\n\nEli. \"Whisht, wife!\"\n\n\"And I did sigh loud, and often. And me sighing so, one came carolling\nlike a bird adown t' other road. 'Ay, chirp and chirp,' cried I\nbitterly. 'Thou has not lost sweetheart, and friend, thy father's\nhearth, thy mother's smile, and every penny in the world.' And at last\nhe did so carol, and carol, I jumped up in ire to get away from his most\njarring mirth. But ere I lied from it, I looked down the path to see\nwhat could make a man so lighthearted in this weary world; and lo! the\nsongster was a humpbacked cripple, with a bloody bandage o'er his eye,\nand both legs gone at the knee.\"\n\n\"He! he! he! he! he!\" went Sybrandt, laughing and cackling.\n\nMargaret's eyes flashed: she began to fold the letter up.\n\n\"Nay, lass,\" said Eli, \"heed him not! Thou unmannerly cur, offer't but\nagain and I put thee to the door.\"\n\n\"Why, what was there to gibe at, Sybrandt?\" remonstrated Catherine more\nmildly. \"Is not our Kate afflicted? and is she not the most content of\nus all, and singeth like a merle at times between her pains? But I am\nas bad as thou; prithee read on, lass, and stop our gabble wi' somewhat\nworth the hearkening.\"\n\n\"'Then,' said I, 'may this thing be?' And I took myself to task.\n'Gerard, son of Eli, dost thou well to bemoan thy lot, thou hast youth\nand health; and here comes the wreck of nature on crutches, praising\nGod's goodness with singing like a mavis?'\"\n\nCatherine. \"There you see.\"\n\nEli. \"Whisht, dame, whisht!\"\n\n\"And whenever he saw me, he left carolling and presently hobbled up and\nchanted, 'Charity, for love of Heaven, sweet master, charity,' with\na whine as piteous as wind at keyhole. 'Alack, poor soul,' said I,\n'charity is in my heart, but not my purse; I am poor as thou.' Then he\nbelieved me none, and to melt me undid his sleeve, and showed a sore\nwound on his arm, and said he, 'Poor cripple though I be, I am like to\nlose this eye to boot, look else.' I saw and groaned for him, and to\nexcuse myself let him wot how I had been robbed of my last copper.\nThereat he left whining all in a moment, and said, in a big manly voice,\n'Then I'll e'en take a rest. Here, youngster, pull thou this strap: nay,\nfear not!' I pulled, and down came a stout pair of legs out of his back;\nand half his hump had melted away, and the wound in his eye no deeper\nthan the bandage.\n\n\"Oh!\" ejaculated Margaret's hearers in a body.\n\n\"Whereat, seeing me astounded, he laughed in my face, and told me I\nwas not worth gulling, and offered me his protection. 'My face was\nprophetic,' he said. 'Of what?' said I. 'Marry,' said he, 'that its\nowner will starve in this thievish land.' Travel teaches e'en the young\nwisdom. Time was I had turned and fled this impostor as a pestilence;\nbut now I listened patiently to pick up crumbs of counsel. And well I\ndid: for nature and his adventurous life had crammed the poor knave with\nshrewdness and knowledge of the homelier sort--a child was I beside him.\nWhen he had turned me inside out, said he, 'Didst well to leave France\nand make for Germany; but think not of Holland again. Nay, on to\nAugsburg and Nurnberg, the Paradise of craftsmen: thence to Venice, an\nthou wilt. But thou wilt never bide in Italy nor any other land, having\nonce tasted the great German cities. Why, there is but one honest\ncountry in Europe, and that is Germany; and since thou art honest, and\nsince I am a vagabone, Germany was made for us twain.' I bade him make\nthat good: how might one country fit true men and knaves! 'Why, thou\nnovice,' said he, 'because in an honest land are fewer knaves to bite\nthe honest man, and many honest men for the knave to bite. I was in\nluck, being honest, to have fallen in with a friendly sharp. Be my pal,'\nsaid he; 'I go to Nurnberg; we will reach it with full pouches. I'll\nlearn ye the cul de bois, and the cul de jatte, and how to maund, and\nchaunt, and patter, and to raise swellings, and paint sores and ulcers\non thy body would take in the divell.' I told him shivering, I'd liever\ndie than shame myself and my folk so.\"\n\nEli. \"Good lad! good lad!\"\n\n\"Why, what shame was it for such as I to turn beggar? Beggary was an\nancient and most honourable mystery. What did holy monks, and bishops,\nand kings, when they would win Heaven's smile? why, wash the feet of\nbeggars, those favourites of the saints. 'The saints were no fools,' he\ntold me. Then he did put out his foot. 'Look at that, that was washed by\nthe greatest king alive, Louis, of France, the last Holy Thursday that\nwas. And the next day, Friday, clapped in the stocks by the warden of\na petty hamlet.' So I told him my foot should walk between such high\nhonour and such low disgrace, on the same path of honesty, please\nGod. Well then, since I had not spirit to beg, he would indulge my\nperversity. I should work under him, he be the head, I the fingers.\nAnd with that he set himself up like a judge, on a heap of dust by the\nroad's side, and questioned me strictly what I could do. I began to say\nI was strong and willing. 'Ba!' said he, 'so is an ox. Say, what canst\ndo that Sir Ox cannot?' I could write; I had won a prize for it. 'Canst\nwrite as fast as the printers?' quo' he, jeering. 'What else?' I could\npaint. 'That was better.' I was like to tear my hair to hear him say so,\nand me going to Rome to write. I could twang the psaltery a bit. 'That\nwas well. Could I tell stories?' Ay, by the score. 'Then,' said he, 'I\nhire you from this moment.' 'What to do?' said I. 'Nought crooked, Sir\nCandour,' says he. 'I will feed thee all the way and find thee work; and\ntake half thine earnings, no more.' 'Agreed,' said I, and gave my hand\non it, 'Now, servant,' said he, 'we will dine. But ye need not stand\nbehind my chair, for two reasons--first I ha' got no chair; and next,\ngood fellowship likes me better than state.' And out of his wallet he\nbrought flesh, fowl, and pastry, a good dozen of spices lapped in flax\npaper, and wine fit for a king. Ne'er feasted I better than out of this\nbeggar's wallet, now my master. When we had well eaten I was for going\non. 'But,' said he, 'servants should not drive their masters too hard,\nespecially after feeding, for then the body is for repose, and the mind\nturns to contemplation;' and he lay on his back gazing calmly at the\nsky, and presently wondered whether there were any beggars up there.\nI told him I knew but of one, called Lazarus. 'Could he do the cul de\njatte better than I?' said he, and looked quite jealous like. I told him\nnay; Lazarus was honest, though a beggar, and fed daily of the crumbs\nfal'n from a rich man's table, and the dogs licked his sores. 'Servant,'\nquo' he, 'I spy a foul fault in thee. Thou liest without discretion: now\nthe end of lying being to gull, this is no better than fumbling with the\ndivell's tail. I pray Heaven thou mayest prove to paint better than thou\ncuttest whids, or I am done out of a dinner. No beggar eats crumbs, but\nonly the fat of the land; and dogs lick not a beggar's sores, being made\nwith spearwort, or ratsbane, or biting acids, from all which dogs, and\neven pigs, abhor. My sores are made after my proper receipt; but no dog\nwould lick e'en them twice. I have made a scurvy bargain: art a cozening\nknave, I doubt, as well as a nincompoop.' I deigned no reply to this\nbundle of lies, which did accuse heavenly truth of falsehood for not\nbeing in a tale with him. He rose and we took the road; and presently\nwe came to a place where were two little wayside inns, scarce a furlong\napart. 'Halt,' said my master. 'Their armories are sore faded--all the\nbetter. Go thou in; shun the master; board the wife; and flatter her inn\nsky high, all but the armories, and offer to colour them dirt cheap.'\nSo I went in and told the wife I was a painter, and would revive her\narmories cheap; but she sent me away with a rebuff. I to my master. He\ngroaned. 'Ye are all fingers and no tongue,' said he; 'I have made a\nscurvy bargain. Come and hear me patter and flatter.' Between the two\ninns was a high hedge. He goes behind it a minute and comes out a decent\ntradesman. We went on to the other inn, and then I heard him praise it\nso fulsome as the very wife did blush. 'But,' says he, 'there is one\nlittle, little fault; your armories are dull and faded. Say but the\nword, and for a silver franc my apprentice here, the cunningest e'er\nI had, shall make them bright as ever. Whilst she hesitated, the rogue\ntold her he had done it to a little inn hard by, and now the inn's face\nwas like the starry firmament. 'D'ye hear that, my man?' cries she,\n'\"The Three Frogs\" have been and painted up their armories; shall \"The\nFour Hedgehogs\" be outshone by them?' So I painted, and my master stood\nby like a lord, advising me how to do, and winking to me to heed him\nnone, and I got a silver franc. And he took me back to 'The Three\nFrogs,' and on the way put me on a beard and disguised me, and\nflattered 'The Three Frogs,' and told them how he had adorned 'The Four\nHedgehogs,' and into the net jumped the three poor simple frogs, and I\nearned another silver franc. Then we went on and he found his crutches,\nand sent me forward, and showed his \"cicatrices d'emprunt,\" as he called\nthem, and all his infirmities, at 'The Four Hedgehogs,' and got both\nfood and money. 'Come, share and share,' quoth he: so I gave him one\nfranc. 'I have made a good bargain,' said he. 'Art a master limner, but\ntakest too much time.' So I let him know that in matters of honest craft\nthings could not be done quick and well. 'Then do them quick,' quoth he.\nAnd he told me my name was Bon Bec; and I might call him Cul de Jatte,\nbecause that was his lay at our first meeting. And at the next town my\nmaster, Cul de Jatte, bought me a psaltery, and set himself up again\nby the roadside in state like him that erst judged Marsyas and Apollo,\npiping for vain glory. So I played a strain. 'Indifferent well,\nharmonious Bon Bec,' said he haughtily. 'Now tune thy pipes.' So I did\nsing a sweet strain the good monks taught me; and singing it reminded\npoor Bon Bec, Gerard erst, of his young days and home, and brought the\nwater to my een. But looking up, my master's visage was as the face of\na little boy whipt soundly, or sipping foulest medicine. 'Zounds, stop\nthat bellyache blether,' quoth he, 'that will ne'er wile a stiver out\no' peasants' purses; 'twill but sour the nurses' milk, and gar the kine\njump into rivers to be out of earshot on't. What, false knave, did I buy\nthee a fine new psaltery to be minded o' my latter end withal? Hearken!\nthese be the songs that glad the heart, and fill the minstrel's purse.'\nAnd he sung so blasphemous a stave, and eke so obscene, as I drew away\nfrom him a space that the lightning might not spoil the new psaltery.\nHowever, none came, being winter, and then I said, 'Master, the Lord\nis debonair. Held I the thunder, yon ribaldry had been thy last, thou\nfoul-mouthed wretch.'\n\n\"'Why, Bon Bec, what is to do?' quoth he. 'I have made an ill bargain.\nOh, perverse heart, that turneth from doctrine.' So I bade him keep\nhis breath to cool his broth, ne'er would I shame my folk with singing\nribald songs. 'Then,' says he sulkily, 'the first fire we light by the\nwayside, clap thou on the music box! so 'twill make our pot boil for the\nnonce; but with your,\n\n     Good people, let us peak and pine,\n     Cut tristful mugs, and miaul and whine\n     Thorough our nosen chaunts divine,\n\nnever, never, never. Ye might as well go through Lorraine crying,\nMulleygrubs, Mulleygrubs, who'll buy my Mulleygrubs!' So we fared on,\nbad friends. But I took a thought, and prayed him hum me one of his\nnaughty ditties again. Then he brightened, and broke forth into ribaldry\nlike a nightingale. Finger in ears stuffed I. 'No words; naught but the\nbare melody.' For oh, Margaret, note the sly malice of the Evil One!\nStill to the scurviest matter he wedded the tunablest ditties.\"\n\nCatherine. \"That is true as Holy Writ.\"\n\nSybrandt. \"How know you that, mother?\"\n\nCornelis. \"He! he! he!\"\n\nEli. \"Whisht, ye uneasy wights, and let me hear the boy. He is wiser\nthan ye; wiser than his years.\"\n\n\"'What tomfoolery is this,' said he; yet he yielded to me, and soon I\ngarnered three of his melodies; but I would not let Cul de Jatte wot the\nthing I meditated. 'Show not fools nor bairns unfinished work,' saith\nthe byword. And by this time 'twas night, and a little town at hand,\nwhere we went each to his inn; for my master would not yield to put\noff his rags and other sores till morning; nor I to enter an inn with\na tatterdemalion. So we were to meet on the road at peep of day, and\nindeed, we still lodged apart, meeting at morn and parting at eve\noutside each town we lay at. And waking at midnight and cogitating, good\nthoughts came down to me, and sudden my heart was enlightened. I called\nto mind that my Margaret had withstood the taking of the burgomaster's\npurse. ''Tis theft,' said you; 'disguise it how ye will.' But I must\nbe wiser than my betters; and now that which I had as good as stolen,\nothers had stolen from me. As it came so it was gone. Then I said,\n'Heaven is not cruel, but just;' and I vowed a vow, to repay our\nburgomaster every shilling an' I could. And I went forth in the morning\nsad, but hopeful. I felt lighter for the purse being gone. My master was\nat the gate becrutched. I told him I'd liever have seen him in another\ndisguise. 'Beggars must not be choosers,' said he. However, soon he bade\nme untruss him, for he felt sadly. His head swam. I told him forcefully\nto deform nature thus could scarce be wholesome. He answered none; but\nlooked scared, and hand on head. By-and-by he gave a groan, and rolled\non the ground like a ball, and writhed sore. I was scared, and wist\nnot what to do, but went to lift him; but his trouble rose higher and\nhigher, he gnashed his teeth fearfully, and the foam did fly from his\nlips; and presently his body bended itself like a bow, and jerked and\nbounded many times into the air. I exorcised him; it but made him\nworse. There was water in a ditch hard by, not very clear; but the poor\ncreature struggling between life and death, I filled my hat withal, and\ncame flying to souse him. Then my lord laughed in my face. 'Come, Bon\nBec, by thy white gills, I have not forgotten my trade.' I stood with\nwatery hat in hand, glaring. 'Could this be feigning?' 'What else?' said\nhe. 'Why, a real fit is the sorriest thing; but a stroke with a feather\ncompared with mine. Art still betters nature.' 'But look, e'en now blood\ntrickleth from your nose,' said I. 'Ay, ay, pricked my nostrils with a\nstraw.' 'But ye foamed at the lips.' 'Oh, a little soap makes a mickle\nfoam.' And he drew out a morsel like a bean from his mouth. 'Thank thy\nstars, Bon Bec,' says he, 'for leading thee to a worthy master. Each day\nhis lesson. To-morrow we will study the cul de bois and other branches.\nTo-day, own me prince of demoniacs, and indeed of all good fellows.'\nThen, being puffed up, he forgot yesterday's grudge, and discoursed\nme freely of beggars; and gave me, who eftsoons thought a beggar was a\nbeggar, and there an end, the names and qualities of full thirty sorts\nof masterful and crafty mendicants in France and Germany and England;\nhis three provinces; for so the poor, proud knave yclept those kingdoms\nthree; wherein his throne it was the stocks I ween. And outside the next\nvillage one had gone to dinner, and left his wheelbarrow. So says he,\n'I'll tie myself in a knot, and shalt wheel me through; and what with\nmy crippledom and thy piety, a-wheeling of thy poor old dad, we'll bleed\nthe bumpkins of a dacha-saltee.' I did refuse. I would work for him; but\nno hand would have in begging. 'And wheeling an \"asker\" in a barrow, is\nnot that work?' said he; 'then fling yon muckle stone in to boot: stay,\nI'll soil it a bit, and swear it is a chip of the holy sepulchre; and\nyou wheeled us both from Jerusalem.' Said I, 'Wheeling a pair o' lies,\none stony, one fleshy, may be work, and hard work, but honest work 'tis\nnot. 'Tis fumbling with his tail you wot of. And,' said I, 'master, next\ntime you go to tempt me to knavery, speak not to me of my poor old dad.'\nSaid I, 'You have minded me of my real father's face, the truest man in\nHolland. He and I are ill friends now, worse luck. But though I offend\nhim shame him I never will.' Dear Margaret, with this knave' saying,\n'your poor old dad,' it had gone to my heart like a knife. ''Tis well,'\nsaid my master gloomily; 'I have made a bad bargain.' Presently he\nhalts, and eyes a tree by the wayside. 'Go spell me what is writ on\nyon tree.' So I went, and there was nought but a long square drawn in\noutline. I told him so. 'So much for thy monkish lore,' quoth he. A\nlittle farther, and he sent me to read a wall. There was nought but a\ncircle scratched on the stone with a point of nail or knife, and in the\ncircle two dots. I said so Then said he, 'Bon Bec, that square was a\nwarning. Some good Truand left it, that came through this village faring\nwest; that means \"dangerous.\" The circle with the two dots was writ by\nanother of our brotherhood; and it signifies as how the writer, soit\nRollin Trapu, soit Triboulet, soit Catin Cul de Bois, or what not, was\nbecked for asking here, and lay two months in Starabin.' Then he broke\nforth. 'Talk: of your little snivelling books that go in pouch. Three\nbooks have I, France, England, and Germany; and they are writ all over\nin one tongue, that my brethren of all countries understand; and that\nis what I call learning. So sith here they whip sores, and imprison\ninfirmities, I to my tiring room.' And he popped behind the hedge, and\ncame back worshipful. We passed through the village, and I sat me down\non the stocks, and even the barber's apprentice whets his razor on a\nblock, so did I flesh my psaltery on this village, fearing great cities.\nI tuned it, and coursed up and down the wires nimbly with my two wooden\nstrikers; and then chanted loud and clear, as I had heard the minstrels\nof the country,\n\n'Qui veut ouir qui veut Savoir,'\n\nsome trash, I mind not what. And soon the villagers, male and female,\nthronged about me; thereat I left singing, and recited them to the\npsaltery a short but right merry tale out of 'the lives of the saints,'\nwhich it is my handbook of pleasant figments and this ended, instantly\nstruck up and whistled one of Cul de Jatte's devil's ditties, and played\nit on the psaltery to boot. Thou knowest Heaven hath bestowed on me a\nrare whistle, both for compass and tune. And with me whistling bright\nand full this sprightly air, and making the wires slow when the tune did\ngallop, and tripping when the tune did amble, or I did stop and shake on\none note like a lark i' the air, they were like to eat me; but looking\nround, lo! my master had given way to his itch, and there was his hat\non the ground, and copper pouring in. I deemed it cruel to whistle the\nbread out of poverty's pouch; so broke off and away; yet could not get\nclear so swift, but both men and women did slobber me sore, and smelled\nall of garlic. 'There, master,' said I, 'I call that cleaving the divell\nin twain and keeping his white half.' Said he, 'Bon Bec, I have made\na good bargain.' Then he bade me stay where I was while he went to the\nHoly Land. I stayed, and he leaped the churchyard dike, and the sexton\nwas digging a grave, and my master chaffered with him, and came back\nwith a knuckle bone. But why he clept a churchyard Holy Land, that I\nlearned not then, but after dinner. I was colouring the armories of a\nlittle inn; and he sat by me most peaceable, a cutting, and filing, and\npolishing bones, sedately; so I speered was not honest work sweet? 'As\nrain water,' said he, mocking. 'What was he a making?' 'A pair of bones\nto play on with thee; and with the refuse a St. Anthony's thumb and\na St. Martin's little finger, for the devout.' The vagabone! And now,\nsweet Margaret, thou seest our manner of life faring Rhineward. I with\nthe two arts I had least prized or counted on for bread was welcome\neverywhere; too poor now to fear robbers, yet able to keep both master\nand man on the road. For at night I often made a portraiture of the\ninnkeeper or his dame, and so went richer from an inn; the which it is\nthe lot of few. But my master despised this even way of life. 'I love\nups and downs,' said he. And certes he lacked them not. One day he would\ngather more than I in three; another, to hear his tale, it had rained\nkicks all day in lieu of 'saltees,' and that is pennies. Yet even then\nat heart he despised me for a poor mechanical soul, and scorned my arts,\nextolling his own, the art of feigning.\n\n\"Natheless, at odd times was he ill at his ease. Going through the town\nof Aix, we came upon a beggar walking, fast by one hand to a cart-tail,\nand the hangman a lashing his bare bloody back. He, stout knave, so\nwhipt, did not a jot relent; but I did wince at every stroke; and my\nmaster hung his head.\n\n\"'Soon or late, Bon Bec,' quoth he. 'Soon or late.' I, seeing his\nhaggard face, knew what he meaned. And at a town whose name hath slipped\nme, but 'twas on a fair river, as we came to the foot of the bridge he\nhalted, and shuddered. 'Why what is the coil?' said I. 'Oh, blind,' said\nhe, 'they are justifying there.' So nought would serve him but take a\nboat, and cross the river by water. But 'twas out of the frying-pan, as\nthe word goeth. For the boatman had scarce told us the matter, and that\nit was a man and a woman for stealing glazed windows out of housen, and\nthat the man was hanged at daybreak, and the quean to be drowned, when\nlo! they did fling her off the bridge, and fell in the water not far\nfrom us. And oh! Margaret, the deadly splash! It ringeth in mine ears\neven now. But worse was coming; for, though tied, she came up and cried\n'Help! help!' and I, forgetting all, and hearing a woman's voice cry\n'Help!' was for leaping in to save her; and had surely done it, but the\nboatman and Cul de Jatte clung round me, and in a moment the bourreau's\nman, that waited in a boat, came and entangled his hooked pole in her\nlong hair, and so thrust her down and ended her. Oh! if the saints\nanswered so our cries for help! And poor Cul de Jatte groaned; and I\nsat sobbing, and beat my breast, and cried, 'Of what hath God made men's\nhearts?'\"\n\nThe reader stopped, and the tears trickled down her cheeks. Gerard\ncrying in Lorraine, made her cry at Rotterdam. The leagues were no more\nto her heart than the breadth of a room.\n\nEli, softened by many touches in the letter, and by the reader's womanly\ngraces, said kindly enough, \"Take thy time, lass. And methinks some of\nye might find her a creepie to rest her foot, and she so near her own\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"I'd do more for her than that an I durst,\" said Catherine. \"Here,\nCornelis,\" and she held out her little wooden stool, and that worthy,\nwho hated Margaret worse than ever, had to take the creepie and put it\ncarefully under her foot.\n\n\"You are very kind, dame,\" she faltered. \"I will read on; 'tis all I can\ndo for you in turn.\n\n\"Thus seeing my master ashy and sore shaken, I deemed this horrible\ntragic act came timeously to warn him, so I strove sore to turn him from\nhis ill ways, discoursing of sinners and their lethal end. 'Too late!'\nsaid he, 'too late!' and gnashed his teeth. Then I told him 'too late'\nwas the divell's favourite whisper in repentant ears. Said I--\n\n     'The Lord is debonair,\n     Let sinners nought despair.'\n\n'Too late!' said he, and gnashed his teeth, and writhed his face, as\nthough vipers were biting his inward parts. But, dear heart, his was a\nmind like running water. Ere we cleared the town he was carolling, and\noutside the gate hung the other culprit, from the bough of a little\ntree, and scarce a yard above the ground. And that stayed my vagabone's\nmusic. But ere we had gone another furlong, he feigned to have dropped\nhis, rosary, and ran back, with no good intent, as you shall hear.\nI strolled on very slowly, and often halting, and presently he came\nstumping up on one leg, and that bandaged. I asked him how he could\ncontrive that, for 'twas masterly done. 'Oh, that was his mystery. Would\nI know that, I must join the brotherhood.' And presently we did pass\na narrow lane, and at the mouth on't espied a written stone, telling\nbeggars by a word like a wee pitchfork to go that way. ''Tis yon\nfarmhouse,' said he: 'bide thou at hand.' And he went to the house, and\ncame back with money, food, and wine. 'This lad did the business,' said\nhe, slapping his one leg proudly. Then he undid the bandage, and with\nprideful face showed me a hole in his calf you could have put your neef\nin. Had I been strange to his tricks, here was a leg had drawn my last\npenny. Presently another farmhouse by the road. He made for it. I stood,\nand asked myself, should I run away and leave him, not to be shamed in\nmy own despite by him? But while I doubted, there was a great noise,\nand my master well cudgelled by the farmer and his men, came towards me\nhobbling and holloaing, for the peasants had laid on heartily. But more\ntrouble was at his heels. Some mischievous wight loosed a dog as big as\na jackass colt, and came roaring after him, and downed him momently. I,\ndeeming the poor rogue's death certain, and him least fit to die, drew\nmy sword and ran shouting. But ere I could come near, the muckle dog had\ntorn away his bad leg, and ran growling to his lair with it; and Cul de\nJatte slipped his knot, and came running like a lapwing, with his hair\non end, and so striking with both crutches before and behind at unreal\ndogs as 'twas like a windmill crazed. He fled adown the road. I followed\nleisurely, and found him at dinner. 'Curse the quiens,' said he. And not\na word all dinner time but 'Curse the quiens!'\n\n\"I said, I must know who' they were, before I would curse them.\n\n\"'Quiens? why, that was dogs. And I knew not even that much? He had made\na bad bargain. Well, well,' said he, 'to-morrow we shall be in Germany.\nThere the folk are music bitten, and they molest not beggars, unless\nthey fake to boot, and then they drown us out of hand that moment, curse\n'em!' We came to Strasbourg. And I looked down Rhine with longing heart.\nThe stream how swift! It seemed running to clip Sevenbergen to its soft\nbosom. With but a piece of timber and an oar I might drift at my ease to\nthee, sleeping yet gliding still. 'Twas a sore temptation. But the fear\nof an ill welcome from my folk, and of the neighbours' sneers, and the\nhope of coming back to thee victorious, not, as now I must, defeated and\nshamed, and thee with me, it did withhold me; and so, with many sighs,\nand often turning of the head to look on beloved Rhine, I turned\nsorrowful face and heavy heart towards Augsburg.\"\n\n\"Alas, dame, alas! Good master Eli, forgive me! But I ne'er can win over\nthis part all at one time. It taketh my breath away. Welladay! Why did\nhe not listen to his heart? Had he not gone through peril enow, sorrow\nenow? Well-a-day! well-a-day!\"\n\nThe letter dropped from her hand, and she drooped like a wounded lily.\n\nThen there was a clatter on the floor, and it was little Kate going on\nher crutches, with flushed face, and eyes full of pity, to console her.\n\"Water, mother,\" she cried. \"I am afeared she shall swoon.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, fear me not,\" said Margaret feebly. \"I will not be so\ntroublesome. Thy good-will it maketh me stouter hearted, sweet mistress\nKate. For, if thou carest how I fare, sure Heaven is not against me.\"\n\nCatherine. \"D'ye hear that, my man!\"\n\nEli. \"Ay, wife, I hear; and mark to boot.\"\n\nLittle Kate went back to her place, and Margaret read on.\n\n\"The Germans are fonder of armorials than the French. So I found work\nevery day. And whiles I wrought, my master would leave me, and doff his\nraiment and don his rags, and other infirmities, and cozen the world,\nwhich he did clepe it 'plucking of the goose:' this done, would meet me\nand demand half my earnings; and with restless piercing eye ask me would\nI be so base as cheat my poor master by making three parts in lieu of\ntwo, till I threatened to lend him a cuff to boot in requital of his\nsuspicion; and thenceforth took his due, with feigned confidence in my\ngood faith, the which his dancing eye belied. Early in Germany we had\na quarrel. I had seen him buy a skull of a jailer's wife, and mighty\nzealous a polishing it. Thought I, 'How can he carry yon memento,\nand not repent, seeing where ends his way?' Presently I did catch him\nselling it to a woman for the head of St. Barnabas, with a tale had\ncozened an Ebrew. So I snatched it out of their hands, and trundled it\ninto the ditch. 'How, thou impious knave,' said I, 'wouldst sell for\na saint the skull of some dead thief, thy brother?' He slunk away. But\nshallow she did crawl after the skull, and with apron reverently dust\nit for Barnabas, and it Barabbas; and so home with it. Said I, 'Non vult\nanser velli, sed populus vult decipi.'\"\n\nCatherine. \"Oh, the goodly Latin!\"\n\nEli. \"What meaneth it?\"\n\nCatherine. \"Nay, I know not; but 'tis Latin; is not that enow? He was\nthe flower of the flock.\"\n\n\"Then I to him, 'Take now thy psaltery, and part we here, for art a\nwalking prison, a walking hell.' But lo! my master fell on his knees,\nand begged me for pity's sake not turn him off. 'What would become of\nhim? He did so love honesty.' 'Thou love honesty?' said I. 'Ay,' said\nhe, 'not to enact it; the saints forbid. But to look on. 'Tis so fair\na thing to look on. Alas, good Bon Bec,' said he; 'hadst starved\nperadventure but for me. Kick not down thy ladder! Call ye that just?\nNay, calm thy choler! Have pity on me! I must have a pal; and how could\nI bear one like myself after one so simple as thou? He might cut my\nthroat for the money that is hid in my belt. 'Tis not much; 'tis not\nmuch. With thee I walk at mine ease; with a sharp I dare not go before\nin a narrow way. Alas! forgive me. Now I know where in thy bonnet lurks\nthe bee, I will ware his sting; I will but pluck the secular goose. 'So\nbe it,' said I. 'And example was contagious: he should be a true man by\nthen we reached Nurnberg. 'Twas a long way to Nurnberg.' Seeing him so\nhumble, I said, 'well, doff rags, and make thyself decent; 'twill\nhelp me forget what thou art.' And he did so; and we sat down to our\nnonemete. Presently came by a reverend palmer with hat stuck round with\ncockle shells from Holy Land, and great rosary of beads like eggs of\nteal, and sandals for shoes. And he leaned a-weary on his long staff,\nand offered us a shell apiece. My master would none. But I, to set him\na better example, took one, and for it gave the poor pilgrim two batzen,\nand had his blessing. And he was scarce gone, when we heard savage\ncries, and came a sorry sight, one leading a wild woman in a chain, all\nrags and howling like a wolf. And when they came nigh us, she fell to\ntearing her rags to threads. The man sought an alms of us, and told us\nhis hard case. 'Twas his wife stark raving mad; and he could not work in\nthe fields, and leave her in his house to fire it, nor cure her could\nbe without the Saintys' help, and had vowed six pounds of wax to St.\nAnthony to heal her, and so was fain beg of charitable folk for the\nmoney. And now she espied us, and flew at me with her long nails, and\nI was cold with fear, so devilish showed, her face and rolling eyes and\nnails like birdys talons. But he with the chain checked her sudden,\nand with his whip did cruelly lash her for it, that I cried, 'Forbear!\nforbear! She knoweth not what she doth;' and gave him a batz. And being\ngone, said I, 'Master, of those twain I know not which is the more\npitiable.' And he laughed in my face, 'Behold thy justice, Bon Bec,'\nsaid he. 'Thou railest on thy poor, good, within an ace of honest\nmaster, and bestowest alms on a \"vopper.\"' 'Vopper,' said I, 'what is\na vopper?' 'why, a trull that feigns madness. That was one of us, that\nsham maniac, and wow but she did it clumsily. I blushed for her and\nthee. Also gavest two batzen for a shell from Holy Land, that came\nno farther than Normandy. I have culled them myself on that coast by\nscores, and sold them to pilgrims true and pilgrims false, to gull flats\nlike thee withal.' 'What!' said I; 'that reverend man?' 'One of us!'\ncried Cul de Jatte; 'one of us! In France we call them \"Coquillarts,\"\nbut here \"Calmierers.\" Railest on me for selling a false relic now and\nthen, and wastest thy earnings on such as sell nought else. I tell thee,\nBon Bec,' said he, 'there is not one true relic on earth's face. The\nSaints died a thousand years agone, and their bones mixed with the\ndust; but the trade in relics, it is of yesterday; and there are forty\nthousand tramps in Europe live by it; selling relics of forty or fifty\nbodies; oh, threadbare lie! And of the true Cross enow to build Cologne\nMinster. Why, then, may not poor Cul de Jatte turn his penny with the\ncrowd? Art but a scurvy tyrannical servant to let thy poor master from\nhis share of the swag with your whoreson pilgrims, palmers and friars,\nblack, grey, and crutched; for all these are of our brotherhood, and of\nour art, only masters they, and we but poor apprentices, in guild.' For\nhis tongue was an ell and a half.\n\n\"'A truce to thy irreverend sophistries,' said I, 'and say what company\nis this a coming.' 'Bohemians,' cried he, 'Ay, ay, this shall be the\nrest of the band.' With that came along so motley a crew as never your\neyes beheld, dear Margaret. Marched at their head one with a banner on\na steel-pointed lance, and girded with a great long sword, and in velvet\ndoublet and leathern jerkin, the which stuffs ne'er saw I wedded afore\non mortal flesh, and a gay feather in his lordly cap, and a couple of\ndead fowls at his back, the which, an the spark had come by honestly, I\nam much mistook. Him followed wives and babes on two lean horses, whose\nflanks still rattled like parchment drum, being beaten by kettles and\ncaldrons. Next an armed man a-riding of a horse, which drew a cart full\nof females and children; and in it, sitting backwards, a lusty\nlazy knave, lance in hand, with his luxurious feet raised on a holy\nwater-pail, that lay along, and therein a cat, new kittened, sat glowing\no'er her brood, and sparks for eyes. And the cart-horse cavalier had on\nhis shoulders a round bundle, and thereon did perch a cock and crowed\nwith zeal, poor ruffler, proud of his brave feathers as the rest, and\nhaply with more reason, being his own. And on an ass another wife and\nnew-born child; and one poor quean a-foot scarce dragged herself along,\nso near her time was she, yet held two little ones by the hand, and\nhelplessly helped them on the road. And the little folk were just a\nfarce; some rode sticks, with horses' heads, between their legs, which\npranced and caracoled, and soon wearied the riders so sore, they stood\nstock still and wept, which cavaliers were presently taken into cart and\ncuffed. And one, more grave, lost in a man's hat and feather, walked in\nEgyptian darkness, handed by a girl; another had the great saucepan on\nhis back, and a tremendous three-footed clay-pot sat on his head\nand shoulders, swallowing him so as he too went darkling led by his\nsweetheart three foot high. When they were gone by, and we had both\nlaughed lustily, said I, 'Natheless, master, my bowels they yearn for\none of that tawdry band, even for the poor wife so near the downlying,\nscarce able to drag herself, yet still, poor soul, helping the weaker on\nthe way.'\n\nCatherine. \"Nay, nay, Margaret. Why, wench, pluck up heart. Certes thou\nart no Bohemian.\"\n\nKate. \"Nay, mother, 'tis not that, I trow, but her father. And, dear\nheart, why take notice to put her to the blush?\"\n\nRichart. \"So I say.\"\n\n\"And he derided me. 'Why, that is a \"biltreger,\"' said he, 'and you\nwaste your bowels on a pillow, or so forth.' I told him he lied. 'Time\nwould show,' said he, 'wait till they camp.' And rising after meat and\nmeditation, and travelling forward, we found them camped between two\ngreat trees on a common by the wayside; and they had lighted a great\nfire, and on it was their caldron; and one of the trees slanting o'er\nthe fire, a kid hung down by a chain from the tree-fork to the fire,\nand in the fork was wedged an urchin turning still the chain to keep the\nmeat from burning, and a gay spark with a feather in his cap cut up\na sheep; and another had spitted a leg of it on a wooden stake; and a\nwoman ended chanticleer's pride with wringing of his neck. And under\nthe other tree four rufflers played at cards and quarrelled, and no word\nsans oath; and of these lewd gamblers one had cockles in his hat and was\nmy reverend pilgrim. And a female, young and comely, and dressed like a\nbutterfly, sat and mended a heap of dirty rags. And Cul de Jatte said,\n'Yon is the \"vopper,\"' and I looked incredulous and looked again, and it\nwas so, and at her feet sat he that had so late lashed her; but I ween\nhe had wist where to strike, or woe betide him; and she did now oppress\nhim sore, and made him thread her very needle, the which he did with\nall humility; so was their comedy turned seamy side without; and Cul de\nJatte told me 'twas still so with 'voppers' and their men in camp; they\nwould don their bravery though but for an hour, and with their tinsel,\nempire, and the man durst not the least gainsay the 'vopper,' or she\nwould turn him off at these times, as I my master, and take another\ntyrant more submissive. And my master chuckled over me. Natheless we\nsoon espied a wife set with her back against the tree, and her hair\ndown, and her face white, and by her side a wench held up to her eye a\nnewborn babe, with words of cheer, and the rough fellow, her husband,\ndid bring her hot wine in a cup, and bade her take courage. And just\no'er the place she sat, they had pinned from bough to bough of those\nneighbouring trees two shawls, and blankets two, together, to keep the\ndrizzle off her. And so had another poor little rogue come into the\nworld; and by her own particular folk tended gipsywise, but of the\nroasters, and boilers, and voppers, and gamblers, no more noticed, no,\nnot for a single moment, than sheep which droppeth her lamb in a field,\nby travellers upon the way. Then said I, 'What of thy foul suspicions,\nmaster? over-knavery blinds the eye as well as over-simplicity.' And he\nlaughed and said, 'Triumph, Bon Bec, triumph. The chances were nine in\nten against thee.' Then I did pity her, to be in a crowd at such a\ntime; but he rebuked me. 'I should pity rather your queens and royal\nduchesses, which by law are condemned to groan in a crowd of nobles and\ncourtiers, and do writhe with shame as, well as sorrow, being come of\ndecent mothers, whereas these gipsy women have no more shame under their\nskins than a wolf ruth, or a hare valour. And, Bon Bec,' quoth he, 'I\nespy in thee a lamentable fault. Wastest thy bowels, wilt have none left\nfor thy poor good master which doeth thy will by night and day.' Then\nwe came forward; and he talked with the men in some strange Hebrew cant\nwhereof no word knew I; and the poor knaves bade us welcome and denied\nus nought. With them, and all they had, 'twas lightly come and lightly\ngo; and when we left them, my master said to me 'This is thy first\nlesson, but to-night we shall lie at Hansburgh. Come with me to the\n\"rotboss\" there, and I'll show thee all our folk and their lays,\nand especially \"the lossners,\" \"the dutzers,\" \"the schleppers,\" \"the\ngickisses,\" \"the schwanfelders, whom in England we call \"shivering\nJemmies,\" \"the suntvegers,\" \"the schwiegers,\" \"the joners,\" \"the\nsesseldegers,\" \"the gensscherers,\" in France \"marcandiers or rifodes,\"\n\"the veranerins,\" \"the stabulers,\" with a few foreigners like ourselves,\nsuch as \"pietres,\" \"francmitoux,\" \"polissons\" \"malingreux,\" \"traters,\"\n\"rufflers,\" \"whipjalks,\" \"dommerars,\" \"glymmerars,\" \"jarkmen,\"\n\"patricos,\" \"swadders,\" \"autem morts,\" \"walking morts\" 'Enow,' cried I,\nstopping him, 'art as gleesome as the Evil One a counting of his imps.\nI'll jot down in my tablet all these caitiffs and their accursed names:\nfor knowledge is knowledge. But go among them, alive or dead, that will\nI not with my good will. Moreover,' said I, 'what need? since I have a\ncompanion in thee who is all the knaves on earth in one?' and thought to\nabash him but his face shone with pride, and hand on breast he did bow\nlow to me. 'If thy wit be scant, good Bon Bec, thy manners are a charm.\nI have made a good bargain.' So he to the 'rotboss,' and I to a decent\ninn, and sketched the landlord's daughter by candle-light, and started\nat morn batzen three the richer, but could not find my master, so\nloitered slowly on, and presently met him coming west for me, and\ncursing the quiens. Why so? Because he could blind the culls but not\nthe quiens. At last I prevailed on him to leave cursing and canting,\nand tell me his adventure. Said he, 'I sat outside the gate of yon\nmonastery, full of sores, which I sho'ed the passers-by. Oh, Bon Bec,\nbeautifuller sores you never saw; and it rained coppers in my hat.\nPresently the monks came home from some procession, and the convent dogs\nran out to meet them, curse the quiens!' 'What, did they fall on thee\nand bite thee, poor soul?' 'Worse, worse, dear Bon Bec. Had they\nbitten me I had earned silver. But the great idiots, being, as I think,\npuppies, or little better, fell on me where I sat, downed me, and fell\na licking my sores among them. As thou, false knave, didst swear the\nwhelps in heaven licked the sores of Lazybones, a beggar of old.' 'Nay,\nnay,' said I, 'I said no such thing. But tell me, since they bit thee\nnot, but sportfully licked thee, what harm?' 'What harm, noodle; why,\nthe sores came off.' 'How could that be?' 'How could aught else be? and\nthem just fresh put on. Did I think he was so weak as bite holes in his\nflesh with ratsbane? Nay, he was an artist, a painter, like his servant,\nand had put on sores made of pig's blood, rye meal, and glue. So when\nthe folk saw my sores go on tongues of puppies, they laughed, and I\nsaw cord or sack before me. So up I jumped, and shouted, \"A miracle a\nmiracle! The very dogs of this holy convent be holy, and have cured me.\nGood fathers,\" cried I, \"whose day is this?\" \"St. Isidore's,\" said one.\n\"St. Isidore,\" cried I, in a sort of rapture. \"Why, St. Isidore is\nmy patron saint: so that accounts.\" And the simple folk swallowed my\nmiracle as those accursed quiens my wounds. But the monks took me inside\nand shut the gate, and put their heads together; but I have a quick ear,\nand one did say, \"Caret miraculo monasterium,\" which is Greek patter,\nleastways it is no beggar's cant. Finally they bade the lay brethren\ngive me a hiding, and take me out a back way and put me on the road, and\nthreatened me did I come back to the town to hand me to the magistrate\nand have me drowned for a plain impostor. \"Profit now by the Church's\ngrace,\" said they, \"and mend thy ways.\" So forward, Bon Bec, for my life\nis not sure nigh hand this town.' As we went he worked his shoulders,\n'Wow but the brethren laid on. And what means yon piece of monk's cant,\nI wonder?' So I told him the words meant 'the monastery is in want of a\nmiracle,' but the application thereof was dark to me. 'Dark,' cried\nhe, 'dark as noon. Why, it means they are going to work the miracle,\nmy miracle, and gather all the grain I sowed. Therefore these blows on\ntheir benefactor's shoulders; therefore is he that wrought their scurry\nmiracle driven forth with stripes and threats. Oh, cozening knaves!'\nSaid I, 'Becomes you to complain of guile.' 'Alas, Bon Bec,' said he, 'I\nbut outwit the simple, but these monks would pluck Lucifer of his\nwing feathers.' And went a league bemoaning himself that he was not\nconvent-bred like his servant 'He would put it to more profit;' and\nrailing on quiens. 'And as for those monks, there was one Above.'\n'Certes,' said I, 'there is one Above. What then?' 'Who will call those\nshavelings to compt, one day,' quoth he. 'And all deceitful men' said\nI. At one that afternoon I got armories to paint: so my master took the\nyellow jaundice and went begging through the town, and with his oily\ntongue, and saffron-water face, did fill his hat. Now in all the towns\nare certain licensed beggars, and one of these was an old favourite\nwith the townsfolk: had his station at St. Martin's porch, the greatest\nchurch: a blind man: they called him blind Hans. He saw my master\ndrawing coppers on the other side the street, and knew him by his tricks\nfor an impostor, so sent and warned the constables, and I met my master\nin the constables' hands, and going to his trial in the town hall. I\nfollowed and many more; and he was none abashed, neither by the pomp\nof justice, nor memory of his misdeeds, but demanded his accuser like a\ntrumpet. And blind Hans's boy came forward, but was sifted narrowly by\nmy master, and stammered and faltered, and owned he had seen nothing,\nbut only carried blind Hans's tale to the chief constable. 'This is but\nhearsay,' said my master. 'Lo ye now, here standeth Misfortune backbit\nby Envy. But stand thou forth, blind Envy, and vent thine own lie.' And\nblind Hans behoved to stand forth, sore against his will. Him did my\nmaster so press with questions, and so pinch and torture, asking him\nagain and again, how, being blind, he could see all that befell, and\nsome that befell not, across a way; and why, an he could not see, he\ncame there holding up his perjured hand, and maligning the misfortunate,\nthat at last he groaned aloud and would utter no word more. And an\nalderman said, 'In sooth, Hans, ye are to blame; hast cast more dirt of\nsuspicion on thyself than on him.' But the burgomaster, a wondrous fat\nman, and methinks of his fat some had gotten into his head, checked him,\nand said, 'Nay, Hans we know this many years, and be he blind or not,\nhe hath passed for blind so long, 'tis all one. Back to thy porch, good\nHans, and let the strange varlet leave the town incontinent on pain of\nwhipping.' Then my master winked to me; but there rose a civic officer\nin his gown of state and golden chain, a Dignity with us lightly prized,\nand even shunned of some, but in Germany and France much courted, save\nby condemned malefactors, to wit the hangman; and says he, 'Ant please\nyou, first let us see why he weareth his hair so thick and low.' And his\nman went and lifted Cul de Jatte's hair, and lo, the upper gristle of\nboth ears was gone. 'How is this knave? quoth the burgomaster. My\nmaster said carelessly, he minded not precisely: his had been a life of\nmisfortunes and losses. When a poor soul has lost the use of his leg,\nnoble sirs, these more trivial woes rest lightly in his memory.' When\nhe found this would not serve his turn, he named two famous battles,\nin each of which he had lost half an ear, a fighting like a true man\nagainst traitors and rebels. But the hangman showed them the two cuts\nwere made at one time, and by measurement. ''Tis no bungling soldiers'\nwork, my masters,' said he, ''tis ourn.' Then the burgomaster gave\njudgment: 'The present charge is not proven against thee; but, an thou\nbeest not guilty now, thou hast been at other times, witness thine ears.\nWherefore I send thee to prison for one month, and to give a florin\ntowards the new hall of the guilds now a building, and to be whipt\nout of the town, and pay the hangman's fee for the same.' And all the\naldermen approved, and my master was haled to prison with one look of\nanguish. It did strike my bosom. I tried to get speech of him, but the\njailer denied me. But lingering near the jail I heard a whistle, and\nthere was Cul de Jatte at a narrow window twenty feet from earth. I went\nunder, and he asked me what made I there? I told him I was loath to go\nforward and not bid him farewell. He seemed quite amazed; but soon his\nsuspicious soul got the better. That was not all mine errand. I told him\nnot all: the psaltery: 'Well, what of that?' 'Twas not mine, but his; I\nwould pay him the price of it. 'Then throw me a rix dollar,' said he.\nI counted out my coins, and they came to a rix dollar and two batzen.\nI threw him up his money in three throws, and when he had got it all\nhe said, softly, 'Bon Bec.' 'Master,' said I. Then the poor rogue was\ngreatly moved. 'I thought ye had been mocking me,' said he; 'oh, Bon\nBec, Bon Bec, if I had found the world like thee at starting I had put\nmy wit to better use, and I had not lain here.' Then he whimpered out,\n'I gave not quite a rix dollar for the jingler;' and threw me back that\nhe had gone to cheat me of; honest for once, and over late; and so, with\nmany sighs, bade me Godspeed. Thus did my master, after often baffling\nmen's justice, fall by their injustice; for his lost ears proved not his\nguilt only, but of that guilt the bitter punishment: so the account was\neven; yet they for his chastisement did chastise him. Natheless he was a\nparlous rogue. Yet he holp to make a man of me. Thanks to his good wit\nI went forward richer far with my psaltery and brush, than with yon as\ngood as stolen purse; for that must have run dry in time, like a big\ntrough, but these a little fountain.\"\n\nRichart. \"How pregnant his reflections be; and but a curly pated lad\nwhen last I saw him. Asking your pardon, mistress. Prithee read on.\"\n\n\"One day I walked alone, and sooth to say, lighthearted, for mine honest\nDenys sweetened the air on the way; but poor Cul de Jatte poisoned\nit. The next day passing a grand house, out came on prancing steeds\na gentleman in brave attire and two servants; they overtook me. The\ngentleman bade me halt. I laughed in my sleeve; for a few batzen were\nall my store. He bade me doff my doublet and jerkin. Then I chuckled\nno more. 'Bethink you, my lord,' said I, ''tis winter. How may a poor\nfellow go bare and live? So he told me I shot mine arrow wide of his\nthought, and off with his own gay jerkin, richly furred, and doublet to\nmatch, and held them forth to me. Then a servant let me know it was a\npenance. 'His lordship had had the ill luck to slay his cousin in their\ncups.' Down to my shoes he changed with me; and set me on his horse like\na popinjay, and fared by my side in my worn weeds, with my psaltery on\nhis back. And said he, 'Now, good youth, thou art Cousin Detstein; and\nI, late count, thy Servant. Play the part well, and help me save my\nbloodstained soul! Be haughty and choleric, as any noble; and I will be\nas humble as I may.' I said I would do my best to play the noble. But\nwhat should I call him? He bade me call him nought but Servant. That\nwould mortify him most, he wist. We rode on a long way in silence; for\nI was meditating this strange chance, that from a beggar's servant had\nmade me master to a count, and also cudgelling my brains how best I\nmight play the master, without being run through the body all at one\ntime like his cousin. For I mistrusted sore my spark's humility; your\nGerman nobles being, to my knowledge, proud as Lucifer, and choleric\nas fire. As for the servants, they did slily grin to one another to see\ntheir master so humbled.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\nA lump, as of lead, had just bounced against the door, and the latch was\nfumbled with unsuccessfully. Another bounce, and the door swung inwards\nwith Giles arrayed in cloth of gold sticking to it like a wasp. He\nlanded on the floor, and was embraced; but on learning what was going\non, trumpeted that he would much liever hear of Gerard than gossip.\n\nSybrandt pointed to a diminutive chair.\n\nGiles showed his sense of this civility by tearing the said Sybrandt\nout of a very big one, and there ensconced himself gorgeous and glowing.\nSybrandt had to wedge himself into the one, which was too small for the\nmagnificent dwarf's soul, and Margaret resumed. But as this part of the\nletter was occupied with notices of places, all which my reader probably\nknows, and if not, can find handled at large in a dozen well-known\nbooks, from Munster to Murray, I skip the topography, and hasten to that\npart where it occurred to him to throw his letter into a journal. The\npersonal narrative that intervened may be thus condensed.\n\nHe spoke but little at first to his new companions, but listened to pick\nup their characters. Neither his noble Servant nor his servants could\nread or write; and as he often made entries in his tablets, he impressed\nthem with some awe. One of his entries was, \"Le peu que sont les\nhommes.\" For he found the surly innkeepers licked the very ground\nbefore him now; nor did a soul suspect the hosier's son in the count's\nfeathers, nor the count in the minstrel's weeds.\n\nThis seems to have surprised him; for he enlarged on it with the naivete\nand pomposity of youth. At one place, being humbly requested to present\nthe inn with his armorial bearings, he consented loftily; but painted\nthem himself, to mine host's wonder, who thought he lowered himself\nby handling brush. The true count stood grinning by, and held the\npaint-pot, while the sham count painted the shield with three\nred herrings rampant under a sort of Maltese cross made with two\nell-measures. At first his plebeian servants were insolent. But this\ncoming to the notice of his noble one, he forgot what he was doing\npenance for, and drew his sword to cut off their ears, heads included.\nBut Gerard interposed and saved them, and rebuked the count severely.\nAnd finally they all understood one another, and the superior mind\nobtained its natural influence. He played the barbarous noble of that\nday vilely. For his heart would not let him be either tyrannical or\ncold. Here were three human beings. He tried to make them all happier\nthan he was; held them ravished with stories and songs, and set Herr\nPenitent and Co. dancing with his whistle and psaltery. For his own\nconvenience he made them ride and tie, and thus pushed rapidly through\nthe country, travelling generally fifteen leagues a day.\n\n\nDIARY.\n\n\"This first day of January I observed a young man of the country to meet\na strange maiden, and kissed his hand, and then held it out to her. She\ntook it with a smile, and lo! acquaintance made; and babbled like old\nfriends. Greeting so pretty and delicate I ne'er did see. Yet were they\nboth of the baser sort. So the next lass I saw a coming, I said to my\nservant lord, 'For further penance bow thy pride; go meet yon base-born\ngirl; kiss thy homicidal hand, and give it her, and hold her in\ndiscourse as best ye may.' And my noble Servant said humbly, 'I shall\nobey my lord.' And we drew rein and watched while he went forward,\nkissed his hand and held it out to her. Forthwith she took it smiling,\nand was most affable with him, and he with her. Presently came up a band\nof her companions. So this time I bade him doff his bonnet to them, as\nthough they were empresses; and he did so. And lo! the lasses drew up as\nstiff as hedgestakes, and moved not nor spake.\"\n\nDenys. \"Aie! aie! aie Pardon, the company.\"\n\n\"This surprised me none; for so they did discountenance poor Denys. And\nthat whole day I wore in experimenting these German lasses; and 'twas\nstill the same. An ye doff bonnet to them they stiffen into statues;\ndistance for distance. But accost them with honest freedom, and with\nthat customary, and though rustical, most gracious proffer, of the\nkissed hand, and they withhold neither their hands in turn nor their\nacquaintance in an honest way. Seeing which I vexed myself that Denys\nwas not with us to prattle with them; he is so fond of women.\" (\"Are you\nfond of women, Denys?\") And the reader opened two great violet eyes upon\nhim with gentle surprise.\n\nDenys. \"Ahem! he says so, she-comrade. By Hannibal's helmet, 'tis their\nfault, not mine. They will have such soft voices, and white skins, and\nsunny hair, and dark blue eyes, and--\"\n\nMargaret. (Reading suddenly.) \"Which their affability I put to profit\nthus. I asked them how they made shift to grow roses in yule? For know,\ndear Margaret, that throughout Germany, the baser sort of lasses wear\nfor head-dress nought but a 'crantz,' or wreath of roses, encircling\ntheir bare hair, as laurel Caesar's; and though of the worshipful,\nscorned, yet is braver, I wist, to your eye and mine which painters be,\nthough sorry ones, than the gorgeous, uncouth, mechanical head-gear of\nthe time, and adorns, not hides her hair, that goodly ornament fitted\nto her head by craft divine. So the good lasses, being questioned close,\ndid let me know, the rosebuds are cut in summer and laid then in great\nclay-pots, thus ordered:--first bay salt, then a row of buds, and over\nthat row bay salt sprinkled; then, another row of buds placed crosswise;\nfor they say it is death to the buds to touch one another; and so on,\nbuds and salt in layers. Then each pot is covered and soldered tight,\nand kept in cool cellar. And on Saturday night the master of the house,\nor mistress, if master be none, opens a pot, and doles the rosebuds out\nto every female in the house, high or low, withouten grudge; then\nsolders it up again. And such as of these buds would full-blown roses\nmake, put them in warm water a little space, or else in the stove, and\nthen with tiny brush and soft, wetted in Rhenish wine, do coax them till\nthey ope their folds. And some perfume them with rose-water. For, alack,\ntheir smell it is fled with the summer; and only their fair bodyes lie\nwithouten soul, in tomb of clay, awaiting resurrection.\n\n\"And some with the roses and buds mix nutmegs gilded, but not by my good\nwill; for gold, brave in itself, cheek by jowl with roses, is but yellow\nearth. And it does the eye's heart good to see these fair heads of hair\ncome, blooming with roses, over snowy roads, and by snow-capt hedges,\nsetting winter's beauty by the side of summer's glory. For what so\nfair as winter's lilies, snow yclept, and what so brave as roses? And\nshouldst have had a picture here, but for their superstition. Leaned a\nlass in Sunday garb, cross ankled, against her cottage corner, whose\nlow roof was snow-clad, and with her crantz did seem a summer flower\nsprouting from winter's bosom. I drew rein, and out pencil and brush to\nlimn her for thee. But the simpleton, fearing the evil eye, or glamour,\nclaps both hands to her face and flies panic-stricken. But indeed, they\nare not more superstitious than the Sevenbergen folk, which take thy\nfather for a magician. Yet softly, sith at this moment I profit by\nthis darkness of their minds; for, at first, sitting down to write this\ndiary, I could frame nor thought nor word, so harried and deaved was I\nwith noise of mechanical persons, and hoarse laughter at dull jests of\none of these particoloured 'fools,' which are so rife in Germany. But\noh, sorry wit, that is driven to the poor resource of pointed ear-caps,\nand a green and yellow body. True wit, methinks, is of the mind. We\nmet in Burgundy an honest wench, though over free for my palate, a\nchambermaid, had made havoc of all these zanies, droll by brute force.\nOh, Digressor! Well then, I to be rid of roaring rusticalls, and\nmindless jests, put my finger in a glass and drew on the table a great\nwatery circle; whereat the rusticalls did look askant, like venison at\na cat; and in that circle a smaller circle. The rusticalls held their\npeace; and besides these circles cabalistical, I laid down on the table\nsolemnly yon parchment deed I had out of your house. The rusticalls held\ntheir breath. Then did I look as glum as might be, and muttered\nslowly thus 'Videamus--quam diu tu fictus morio--vosque veri\nstulti--audebitis--in hac aula morari, strepitantes ita--et olentes: ut\ndulcissimae nequeam miser scribere.' They shook like aspens, and stole\naway on tiptoe one by one at first, then in a rush and jostling, and\nleft me alone; and most scared of all was the fool: never earned jester\nfairer his ass's ears. So rubbed I their foible, who first rubbed mine;\nfor of all a traveller's foes I dread those giants twain, Sir Noise, and\neke Sir Stench. The saints and martyrs forgive my peevishness. Thus I\nwrite to thee in balmy peace, and tell thee trivial things scarce worthy\nink, also how I love thee, which there was no need to tell, for well\nthou knowest it. And oh, dear Margaret, looking on their roses, which\ngrew in summer, but blow in winter, I see the picture of our true\naffection; born it was in smiles and bliss, but soon adversity beset\nus sore with many a bitter blast. Yet our love hath lost no leaf, thank\nGod, but blossoms full and fair as ever, proof against frowns, and\njibes, and prison, and banishment, as those sweet German flowers a\nblooming in winter's snow.\n\n\"January 2.--My servant, the count, finding me curious, took me to the\nstables of the prince that rules this part. In the first court was a\nhorse-bath, adorned with twenty-two pillars, graven with the prince's\narms; and also the horse-leech's shop, so furnished as a rich apothecary\nmight envy. The stable is a fair quadrangle, whereof three sides filled\nwith horses of all nations. Before each horse's nose was a glazed\nwindow, with a green curtain to be drawn at pleasure, and at his tail a\nthick wooden pillar with a brazen shield, whence by turning of a pipe he\nis watered, and serves too for a cupboard to keep his comb and rubbing\nclothes. Each rack was iron, and each manger shining copper, and each\nnag covered with a scarlet mantle, and above him his bridle and saddle\nhung, ready to gallop forth in a minute; and not less than two hundred\nhorses, whereof twelve score of foreign breed. And we returned to our\ninn full of admiration, and the two varlets said sorrowfully, 'Why were\nwe born with two legs?' And one of the grooms that was civil and had of\nme trinkgeld, stood now at his cottage-door and asked us in. There we\nfound his wife and children of all ages, from five to eighteen, and had\nbut one room to bide and sleep in, a thing pestiferous and most uncivil.\nThen I asked my Servant, knew he this prince? Ay, did he, and had often\ndrunk with him in a marble chamber above the stable, where, for table,\nwas a curious and artificial rock, and the drinking vessels hang on its\npinnacles, and at the hottest of the engagement a statue of a horseman\nin bronze came forth bearing a bowl of liquor, and he that sat nearest\nbehoved to drain it. ''Tis well,' said I: 'now for thy penance, whisper\nthou in yon prince's ear, that God hath given him his people freely, and\nnot sought a price for them as for horses. And pray him look inside the\nhuts at his horse-palace door, and bethink himself is it well to house\nhis horses, and stable his folk.' Said he, ''Twill give sore offence.'\n'But,' said I, 'ye must do it discreetly and choose your time.' So he\npromised. And riding on we heard plaintive cries. 'Alas,' said I, 'some\nsore mischance hath befallen some poor soul: what may it be?' And we\nrode up, and lo! it was a wedding feast, and the guests were plying the\nbusiness of drinking sad and silent, but ever and anon cried loud and\ndolefully, 'Seyte frolich! Be merry.'\n\n\"January 3.--Yesterday between Nurnberg and Augsburg we parted company.\nI gave my lord, late Servant, back his brave clothes for mine, but his\nhorse he made me keep, and five gold pieces, and said he was still my\ndebtor, his penance it had been slight along of me, but profitable. But\nhis best word was this: 'I see 'tis more noble to be loved than feared.'\nAnd then he did so praise me as I blushed to put on paper; yet, poor\nfool, would fain thou couldst hear his words, but from some other pen\nthan mine. And the servants did heartily grasp my hand, and wish me good\nluck. And riding apace, yet could I not reach Augsburg till the\ngates were closed; but it mattered little, for this Augsburg it is\nan enchanted city. For a small coin one took me a long way round to\na famous postern called der Einlasse. Here stood two guardians, like\nstatues. To them I gave my name and business. They nodded me leave to\nknock; I knocked; and the iron gate opened with a great noise and hollow\nrattling of a chain, but no hand seen nor chain; and he who drew the\nhidden chain sits a butt's length from the gate; and I rode in, and the\ngate closed with a clang after me. I found myself in a great building\nwith a bridge at my feet. This I rode over and presently came to a\nporter's lodge, where one asked me again my name and business, then rang\na bell, and a great portcullis that barred the way began to rise, drawn\nby a wheel overhead, and no hand seen. Behind the portcullis was a thick\noaken door studded with steel. It opened without hand, and I rode into a\nhall as dark as pitch. Trembling there a while, a door opened and showed\nme a smaller hall lighted. I rode into it: a tin goblet came down from\nthe ceiling by a little chain: I put two batzen into it, and it went\nup again. Being gone, another thick door creaked and opened, and I\nrid through. It closed on me with a tremendous clang, and behold me in\nAugsburg city. I lay at an inn called 'The Three Moors,' over an hundred\nyears old; and this morning, according to my way of viewing towns to\nlearn their compass and shape, I mounted the highest tower I could\nfind, and setting my dial at my foot surveyed the beautiful city: whole\nstreets of palaces and churches tiled with copper burnished like gold;\nand the house fronts gaily painted and all glazed, and the glass so\nclean and burnished as 'tis most resplendent and rare; and I, now first\nseeing a great city, did crow with delight, and like cock on his ladder,\nand at the tower foot was taken into custody for a spy; for whilst I\nwatched the city the watchman had watched me. The burgomaster received\nme courteously and heard my story; then rebuked he the officers. 'Could\nye not question him yourselves, or read in his face? This is to make our\ncity stink in strangers' report.' Then he told me my curiosity was of a\ncommendable sort; and seeing I was a craftsman and inquisitive, bade\nhis clerk take me among the guilds. God bless the city where the very\nburgomaster is cut of Soloman's cloth!\n\n\"January 5.--Dear Margaret, it is a noble city, and a kind mother to\narts. Here they cut in wood and ivory, that 'tis like spider's work, and\npaint on glass, and sing angelical harmonies. Writing of books is quite\ngone by; here be six printers. Yet was I offered a bountiful wage to\nwrite fairly a merchant's accounts, one Fugger, a grand and wealthy\ntrader, and hath store of ships, yet his father was but a poor weaver.\nBut here in commerce, her very garden, men swell like mushrooms. And he\nbought my horse of me, and abated me not a jot, which way of dealing is\nnot known in Holland. But oh, Margaret, the workmen of all the guilds\nare so kind and brotherly to one another, and to me. Here, methinks,\nI have found the true German mind, loyal, frank, and kindly, somewhat\ncholeric withal, but nought revengeful. Each mechanic wears a sword. The\nvery weavers at the loom sit girded with their weapons, and all Germans\non too slight occasion draw them and fight; but no treachery: challenge\nfirst, then draw, and with the edge only, mostly the face, not with Sir\nPoint; for if in these combats one thrust at his adversary and hurt him,\n'tis called ein schelemstucke, a heinous act, both men and women turn\ntheir backs on him; and even the judges punish thrusts bitterly, but\npass over cuts. Hence in Germany be good store of scarred faces, three\nin five at least, and in France scarce more than one in three.\n\n\"But in arts mechanical no citizens may compare with these. Fountains\nin every street that play to heaven, and in the gardens seeming trees,\nwhich being approached, one standing afar touches a spring, and\nevery twig shoots water, and souses the guests to their host's much\ndelectation. Big culverins of war they cast with no more ado than our\nfolk horse-shoes, and have done this fourscore years. All stuffs they\nweave, and linen fine as ours at home, or nearly, which elsewhere\nin Europe vainly shall ye seek. Sir Printing Press--sore foe to poor\nGerard, but to other humans beneficial--plieth by night and day, and\ncasteth goodly words like sower afield; while I, poor fool, can but sow\nthem as I saw women in France sow rye, dribbling it in the furrow grain\nby grain. And of their strange mechanical skill take two examples. For\nending of exemplary rogues they have a figure like a woman, seven feet\nhigh, and called Jung Frau; but lo, a spring is touched, she seizeth the\npoor wretch with iron arms, and opening herself, hales him inside\nher, and there pierces him through and through with two score lances.\nSecondly, in all great houses the spit is turned not by a scrubby boy,\nbut by smoke. Ay, mayst well admire, and judge me a lying knave. These\ncunning Germans do set in the chimney a little windmill, and the smoke\nstruggling to wend past, turns it, and from the mill a wire runs through\nthe wall and turns the spit on wheels; beholding which I doffed my\nbonnet to the men of Augsburg, for who but these had ere devised to bind\nye so dark and subtle a knave as Sir Smoke, and set him to roast Dame\nPullet?\n\n\"This day, January 8, with three craftsmen of the town, I painted a pack\nof cards. They were for a senator, in a hurry. I the diamonds. My queen\ncame forth with eyes like spring violets, hair a golden brown, and\nwitching smile. My fellow-craftsmen saw her, and put their arms round\nmy neck and hailed me master. Oh, noble Germans! No jealousy of a\nbrother-workman: no sour looks at a stranger; and would have me spend\nSunday with them after matins; and the merchant paid me so richly as I\nwas ashamed to take the guerdon; and I to my inn, and tried to paint\nthe queen of diamonds for poor Gerard; but no, she would not come like\nagain. Luck will not be bespoke. Oh, happy rich man that hath got her!\nFie! fie! Happy Gerard that shall have herself one day, and keep house\nwith her at Augsburg.\n\n\"January 8.--With my fellows, and one Veit Stoss, a wood-carver, and\none Hafnagel, of the goldsmiths' guild, and their wives and lasses,\nto Hafnagel's cousin, a senator of this free city, and his stupendous\nwine-vessel. It is ribbed like a ship, and hath been eighteen months in\nhand, and finished but now, and holds a hundred and fifty hogsheads, and\nstandeth not, but lieth; yet even so ye get not on his back, withouten\nladders two, of thirty steps. And we sat about the miraculous mass, and\ndrank Rhenish from it, drawn by a little artificial pump, and the lasses\npinned their crantzes to it, and we danced round it, and the senator\ndanced on its back, but with drinking of so many garausses, lost his\nfooting and fell off, glass in hand, and broke an arm and a leg in the\nmidst of us. So scurvily ended our drinking bout for this time.\n\n\"January 10.--This day started for Venice with a company of merchants,\nand among them him who had desired me for his scrivener; and so we are\nnow agreed, I to write at night the letters he shall dict, and other\nmatters, he to feed and lodge me on the road. We be many and armed, and\nsoldiers with us to boot, so fear not the thieves which men say lie on\nthe borders of Italy. But an if I find the printing press at Venice, I\ntrow I shall not go unto Rome, for man may not vie with iron.\n\n\"Imprimit una dies quantum non scribitur anno. And, dearest, something\ntells me you and I shall end our days at Augsburg, whence going, I shall\nleave it all I can--my blessing.\n\n\"January 12.--My master affecteth me much, and now maketh me sit with\nhim in his horse-litter. A grave good man, of all respected, but sad\nfor loss of a dear daughter, and loveth my psaltery: not giddy-faced\nditties, but holy harmonies such as Cul de Jatte made wry mouths at. So\nmany men, so many minds. But cooped in horse-litter and at night writing\nhis letters, my journal halteth.\n\n\"January 14.--When not attending on my good merchant, I consort with\nsuch of our company as are Italians, for 'tis to Italy I wend, and I\nam ill seen in Italian tongue. A courteous and a subtle people, at meat\ndelicate feeders and cleanly: love not to put their left hand in the\ndish. They say Venice is the garden of Lombardy, Lombardy the garden of\nItaly, Italy of the world.\n\n\"January 16.-Strong ways and steep, and the mountain girls so girded up,\nas from their armpits to their waist is but a handful. Of all the garbs\nI yet have seen, the most unlovely.\n\n\"January 18.-In the midst of life we are in death. Oh! dear Margaret,\nI thought I had lost thee. Here I lie in pain and dole, and shall\nwrite thee that, which read you it in a romance ye should cry, 'Most\nimprobable!' And so still wondering that I am alive to write it, and\nthanking for it God and the saints, this is what befell thy Gerard.\nYestreen I wearied of being shut up in litter, and of the mule's slow\npace, and so went forward; and being, I know not why, strangely full\nof spirit and hope, as I have heard befall some men when on trouble's\nbrink, seemed to tread on air, and soon distanced them all. Presently I\ncame to two roads, and took the larger; I should have taken the smaller.\nAfter travelling a good half-hour, I found my error, and returned; and\ndeeming my company had long passed by, pushed bravely on, but I could\nnot overtake them; and small wonder, as you shall hear. Then I was\nanxious, and ran, but bare was the road of those I sought; and night\ncame down, and the wild beasts a-foot, and I bemoaned my folly; also I\nwas hungered. The moon rose clear and bright exceedingly, and presently\na little way off the road I saw a tall windmill. 'Come,' said I, 'mayhap\nthe miller will take ruth on me.' Near the mill was a haystack, and\nscattered about were store of little barrels; but lo they were not\nflour-barrels, but tar-barrels, one or two, and the rest of spirits,\nBrant vein and Schiedam; I knew them momently, having seen the like in\nHolland. I knocked at the mill-door, but none answered. I lifted the\nlatch, and the door opened inwards. I went in, and gladly, for the night\nwas fine but cold, and a rime on the trees, which were a kind of lofty\nsycamores. There was a stove, but black; I lighted it with some of the\nhay and wood, for there was a great pile of wood outside, and I know\nnot how, I went to sleep. Not long had I slept, I trow, when hearing a\nnoise, I awoke; and there were a dozen men around me, with wild faces,\nand long black hair, and black sparkling eyes.\"\n\nCatherine. \"Oh, my poor boy! those black-haired ones do still scare me\nto look on.\"\n\n\"I made my excuses in such Italian as I knew, and eking out by\nsigns. They grinned. 'I had lost my company.' They grinned. 'I was an\nhungered.' Still they grinned, and spoke to one another in a tongue I\nknew not. At last one gave me a piece of bread and a tin mug of wine,\nas I thought, but it was spirits neat. I made a wry face and asked for\nwater: then these wild men laughed a horrible laugh. I thought to fly,\nbut looking towards the door it was bolted with two enormous bolts of\niron, and now first, as I ate my bread, I saw it was all guarded too,\nand ribbed with iron. My blood curdled within me, and yet I could\nnot tell thee why; but hadst thou seen the faces, wild, stupid, and\nruthless. I mumbled my bread, not to let them see I feared them; but oh,\nit cost me to swallow it and keep it in me. Then it whirled in my brain,\nwas there no way to escape? Said I, 'They will not let me forth by\nthe door; these be smugglers or robbers.' So I feigned drowsiness, and\ntaking out two batzen said, 'Good men, for our Lady's grace let me lie\non a bed and sleep, for I am faint with travel.' They nodded and grinned\ntheir horrible grin, and bade one light a lanthorn and lead me. He took\nme up a winding staircase, up, up, and I saw no windows, but the wooden\nwalls were pierced like a barbican tower, and methinks for the same\npurpose, and through these slits I got glimpses of the sky, and thought,\n'Shall I e'er see thee again?' He took me to the very top of the mill,\nand there was a room with a heap of straw in one corner and many empty\nbarrels, and by the wall a truckle bed. He pointed to it, and went\ndownstairs heavily, taking the light, for in this room was a great\nwindow, and the moon came in bright. I looked out to see, and lo, it\nwas so high that even the mill sails at their highest came not up to my\nwindow by some feet, but turned very slow and stately underneath, for\nwind there was scarce a breath; and the trees seemed silver filagree\nmade by angel craftsmen. My hope of flight was gone.\n\n\"But now, those wild faces being out of sight, I smiled at my fears:\nwhat an if they were ill men, would it profit them to hurt me?\nNatheless, for caution against surprise, I would put the bed against the\ndoor. I went to move it, but could not. It was free at the head, but at\nthe foot fast clamped with iron to the floor. So I flung my psaltery on\nthe bed, but for myself made a layer of straw at the door, so as none\ncould open on me unawares. And I laid my sword ready to my hand. And\nsaid my prayers for thee and me, and turned to sleep.\n\n\"Below they drank and made merry. And hearing this gave me confidence.\nSaid I, 'Out of sight, out of mind. Another hour and the good Schiedam\nwill make them forget that I am here.' And so I composed myself to\nsleep. And for some time could not for the boisterous mirth below.\nAt last I dropped off. How long I slept I knew not; but I woke with a\nstart: the noise had ceased below, and the sudden silence woke me. And\nscarce was I awake, when sudden the truckle bed was gone with a loud\nclang all but the feet, and the floor yawned, and I heard my psaltery\nfall and break to atoms, deep, deep, below the very floor of the mill.\nIt had fallen into a well. And so had I done, lying where it lay.\"\n\nMargaret shuddered and put her face in her hands. But speedily resumed.\n\n\"I lay stupefied at first. Then horror fell on me, and I rose, but stood\nrooted there, shaking from head to foot. At last I found myself looking\ndown into that fearsome gap, and my very hair did bristle as I peered.\nAnd then, I remember, I turned quite calm, and made up my mind to die\nsword in hand. For I saw no man must know this their bloody secret and\nlive. And I said, 'Poor Margaret!' And I took out of my bosom, where\nthey lie ever, our marriage lines, and kissed them again and again. And\nI pinned them to my shirt again, that they might lie in one grave with\nme, if die I must. And I thought, 'All our love and hopes to end thus!'\"\n\nEli. \"Whisht all! Their marriage lines? Give her time! But no word. I\ncan bear no chat. My poor lad!\"\n\nDuring the long pause that ensued Catherine leaned forward and passed\nsomething adroitly from her own lap under her daughter's apron who sat\nnext her.\n\n\"Presently thinking, all in a whirl, of all that ever passed between us,\nand taking leave of all those pleasant hours, I called to mind how one\nday at Sevenbergen thou taughtest me to make a rope of straw. Mindest\nthou? The moment memory brought that happy day back to me, I cried out\nvery loud: 'Margaret gives me a chance for life even here.' I woke from\nmy lethargy. I seized on the straw and twisted it eagerly, as thou didst\nteach me, but my fingers trembled and delayed the task. Whiles I wrought\nI heard a door open below. That was a terrible moment. Even as I twisted\nmy rope I got to the window and looked down at the great arms of the\nmill coming slowly up, then passing, then turning less slowly down, as\nit seemed; and I thought, 'They go not as when there is wind: yet, slow\nor fast, what man rid ever on such steed as these, and lived. Yet,' said\nI, 'better trust to them and God than to ill men.' And I prayed to Him\nwhom even the wind obeyeth.\n\n\"Dear Margaret, I fastened my rope, and let myself gently down, and\nfixed my eye on that huge arm of the mill, which then was creeping up\nto me, and went to spring on to it. But my heart failed me at the pinch.\nAnd methought it was not near enow. And it passed calm and awful by. I\nwatched for another; they were three. And after a little while one crept\nup slower than the rest methought. And I with my foot thrust myself in\ngood time somewhat out from the wall, and crying aloud 'Margaret!' did\ngrip with all my soul the wood-work of the sail, and that moment was\nswimming in the air.\"\n\nGiles. \"WELL DONE! WELL DONE!\"\n\n\"Motion I felt little; but the stars seemed to go round the sky, and then\nthe grass came up to me nearer and nearer, and when the hoary grass was\nquite close I was sent rolling along it as if hurled from a catapult,\nand got up breathless, and every point and tie about me broken. I rose,\nbut fell down again in agony. I had but one leg I could stand on.\"\n\nCatherine. \"Eh! dear! his leg is broke, my boy's leg is broke.\"\n\n\"And e'en as I lay groaning, I heard a sound like thunder. It was the\nassassins running up the stairs. The crazy old mill shook under them.\nThey must have found that I had not fallen into their bloody trap, and\nwere running to despatch me. Margaret, I felt no fear, for I had now\nno hope. I could neither run nor hide; so wild the place, so bright the\nmoon. I struggled up all agony and revenge, more like some wounded wild\nbeast than your Gerard. Leaning on my sword hilt I hobbled round; and\nswift as lighting, or vengeance, I heaped a great pile of their hay\nand wood at the mill door; then drove my dagger into a barrel of their\nsmuggled spirits, and flung it on; then out with my tinder and lighted\nthe pile. 'This will bring true men round my dead body,' said I.\n'Aha!' I cried, 'think you I'll die alone, cowards, assassins! reckless\nfiends!' and at each word on went a barrel pierced. But oh, Margaret!\nthe fire fed by the spirits surprised me: it shot up and singed my\nvery hair, it went roaring up the side of the mill, swift as falls\nthe lightning; and I yelled and laughed in my torture and despair, and\npierced more barrels and the very tar-barrels, and flung them on. The\nfire roared like a lion for its prey, and voices answered it inside from\nthe top of the mill, and the feet came thundering down, and I stood\nas near that awful fire as I could, with uplifted sword to slay and\nbe slain. The bolt was drawn. A tar-barrel caught fire. The door was\nopened. What followed? Not the men came out, but the fire rushed in\nat them like a living death, and the first I thought to fight with was\nblackened and crumpled on the floor like a leaf. One fearsome yell, and\ndumb for ever. The feet ran up again, but fewer. I heard them hack with\ntheir swords a little way up at the mill's wooden sides; but they had\nno time to hew their way out: the fire and reek were at their heels, and\nthe smoke burst out at every loophole, and oozed blue in the moonlight\nthrough each crevice. I hobbled back, racked with pain and fury. There\nwere white faces up at my window. They saw me. They cursed me. I cursed\nthem back and shook my naked sword: 'Come down the road I came,' I\ncried. 'But ye must come one by one, and as ye come, ye die upon this\nsteel.' Some cursed at that, but others wailed. For I had them all at\ndeadly vantage. And doubtless, with my smoke-grimed face and fiendish\nrage, I looked a demon. And now there was a steady roar inside the mill.\nThe flame was going up it as furnace up its chimney. The mill caught\nfire. Fire glimmered through it. Tongues of flame darted through each\nloophole and shot sparks and fiery flakes into the night. One of the\nassassins leaped on to the sail, as I had done. In his hurry he missed\nhis grasp and fell at my feet, and bounded from the hard ground like\na ball, and never spoke, nor moved again. And the rest screamed like\nwomen, and with their despair came back to me both ruth for them and\nhope of life for myself. And the fire gnawed through the mill in placen,\nand shot forth showers of great flat sparks like flakes of fiery snow;\nand the sails caught fire one after another; and I became a man again\nand staggered away terror-stricken, leaning on my sword, from the sight\nof my revenge, and with great bodily pain crawled back to the road.\nAnd, dear Margaret, the rimy trees were now all like pyramids of\ngolden filagree, and lace, cobweb fine, in the red firelight. Oh! most\nbeautiful! And a poor wretch got entangled in the burning sails, and\nwhirled round screaming, and lost hold at the wrong time, and hurled\nlike stone from mangonel high into the air; then a dull thump; it was\nhis carcass striking the earth. The next moment there was a loud crash.\nThe mill fell in on its destroyer, and a million great sparks flew up,\nand the sails fell over the burning wreck, and at that a million more\nsparks flew up, and the ground was strewn with burning wood and men. I\nprayed God forgive me, and kneeling with my back to that fiery shambles,\nI saw lights on the road; a welcome sight. It was a company coming\ntowards me, and scarce two furlongs off. I hobbled towards them. Ere I\nhad gone far I heard a swift step behind me. I turned. One had escaped;\nhow escaped, who can divine? His sword shone in the moonlight. I feared\nhim. Methought the ghosts of all those dead sat on that glittering\nglaive. I put my other foot to the ground, maugre the anguish, and fled\ntowards the torches, moaning with pain, and shouting for aid. But what\ncould I do He gained on me. Behooved me turn and fight. Denys had taught\nme sword play in sport. I wheeled, our swords clashed. His clothes\nthey smelled all singed. I cut swiftly upward with supple hand, and his\ndangled bleeding at the wrist, and his sword fell; it tinkled on the\nground. I raised my sword to hew him should he stoop for't. He stood\nand cursed me. He drew his dagger with his left; I opposed my point and\ndared him with my eye to close. A great shout arose behind me from true\nmen's throats. He started. He spat at me in his rage, then gnashed his\nteeth and fled blaspheming. I turned and saw torches close at hand.\nLo, they fell to dancing up and down methought, and the\nnext-moment-all-was-dark. I had--ah!\"\n\nCatherine. \"Here, help! water! Stand aloof, you that be men!\"\n\nMargaret had fainted away.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV\n\nWhen she recovered, her head was on Catherine's arm, and the honest half\nof the family she had invaded like a foe stood round her uttering rough\nhomely words of encouragement, especially Giles, who roared at her that\nshe was not to take on like that. \"Gerard was alive and well, or he\ncould not have writ this letter, the biggest mankind had seen as yet,\nand,\" as he thought, \"the beautifullest, and most moving, and smallest\nwrit.\"\n\n\"Ay, good Master Giles,\" sighed Margaret feebly, \"he was alive. But how\nknow I what hath since befallen him? Oh, why left he Holland to go among\nstrangers fierce as lions? And why did I not drive him from me sooner\nthan part him from his own flesh and blood? Forgive me, you that are his\nmother!\"\n\nAnd she gently removed Catherine's arm, and made a feeble attempt to\nslide off the chair on to her knees, which, after a brief struggle with\nsuperior force, ended in her finding herself on Catherine's bosom. Then\nMargaret held out the letter to Eli, and said faintly but sweetly, \"I\nwill trust it from my hand now. In sooth, I am little fit to read any\nmore-and-and--loth to leave my comfort;\" and she wreathed her other arm\nround Catherine's neck.\n\n\"Read thou, Richart,\" said Eli: \"thine eyes be younger than mine.\"\n\nRichart took the letter. \"Well,\" said he, \"such writing saw I never. A\nwriteth with a needle's point; and clear to boot. Why is he not in my\ncounting-house at Amsterdam instead of vagabonding it out yonder!\"\n\n\"When I came to myself I was seated in the litter, and my good merchant\nholding of my hand. I babbled I know not what, and then shuddered awhile\nin silence. He put a horn of wine to my lips.\"\n\nCatherine. \"Bless him! bless him!\"\n\nEli. \"Whisht!\"\n\n\"And I told him what had befallen. He would see my leg. It was sprained\nsore, and swelled at the ankle; and all my points were broken, as I\ncould scarce keep up my hose, and I said, 'Sir, I shall be but a burden\nto you, I doubt, and can make you no harmony now; my poor psaltery it\nis broken;' and I did grieve over my broken music, companion of so many\nweary leagues. But he patted me on the cheek, and bade me not fret; also\nhe did put up my leg on a pillow, and tended me like a kind father.\n\n\"January 19.--I sit all day in the litter, for we are pushing forward\nwith haste, and at night the good, kind merchant sendeth me to bed, and\nwill not let me work. Strange! whene'er I fall in with men like fiends,\nthen the next moment God still sendeth me some good man or woman, lest I\nshould turn away from human kind. Oh, Margaret! how strangely mixed they\nbe, and how old I am by what I was three months agone. And lo! if good\nMaster Fugger hath not been and bought me a psaltery.\"\n\nCatherine. \"Eli, my man, an yon merchant comes our way let us buy a\nhundred ells of cloth of him, and not higgle.\"\n\nEli. \"That will I, take your oath on't!\"\n\nWhile Richart prepared to read, Kate looked at her mother, and with a\nfaint blush drew out the piece of work from under her apron, and sewed\nwith head depressed a little more than necessary. On this her mother\ndrew a piece of work out of her pocket, and sewed too, while Richart\nread. Both the specimens these sweet surreptitious creatures now first\nexposed to observation were babies' caps, and more than half finished,\nwhich told a tale. Horror! they were like little monks' cowls in shape\nand delicacy.\n\n\"January 20.--Laid up in the litter, and as good as blind, but halting\nto bait, Lombardy plains burst on me. Oh, Margaret! a land flowing\nwith milk and honey; all sloping plains, goodly rivers, jocund meadows,\ndelectable orchards, and blooming gardens; and though winter, looks\nwarmer than poor beloved Holland at midsummer, and makes the wanderer's\nface to shine, and his heart to leap for joy to see earth so kind and\nsmiling. Here be vines, cedars, olives, and cattle plenty, but three\ngoats to a sheep. The draught oxen wear white linen on their necks, and\nstanding by dark green olive-trees each one is a picture; and the folk,\nespecially women, wear delicate strawen hats with flowers and leaves\nfairly imitated in silk, with silver mixed. This day we crossed a river\nprettily in a chained ferry-boat. On either bank was a windlass, and a\nsingle man by turning of it drew our whole company to his shore, whereat\nI did admire, being a stranger. Passed over with us some country folk.\nAnd an old woman looking at a young wench, she did hide her face with\nher hand, and held her crucifix out like knight his sword in tourney\ndreading the evil eye.\n\n\"January 25.--Safe at Venice. A place whose strange and passing beauty\nis well known to thee by report of our mariners. Dost mind too how Peter\nwould oft fill our ears withal, we handed beneath the table, and he\nstill discoursing of this sea-enthroned and peerless city, in shape a\nbow, and its great canal and palaces on piles, and its watery ways plied\nby scores of gilded boats; and that market-place of nations, orbis,\nnon urbis, forum, St. Mark, his place? And his statue with the peerless\njewels in his eyes, and the lion at his gate? But I, lying at my window\nin pain, may see none of these beauties as yet, but only a street,\nfairly paved, which is dull, and houses with oiled paper and linen,\nin lieu of glass, which is rude; and the passers-by, their habits and\ntheir gestures, wherein they are superfluous. Therefore, not to miss my\ndaily comfort of whispering to thee, I will e'en turn mine eyes inward,\nand bind my sheaves of wisdom reaped by travel. For I love thee so, that\nno treasure pleases me not shared with thee; and what treasure so good\nand enduring as knowledge? This then have I, Sir Footsore, learned, that\neach nation hath its proper wisdom, and its proper folly; and methinks,\ncould a great king, or duke, tramp like me, and see with his own eyes,\nhe might pick the flowers, and eschew the weeds of nations, and go home\nand set his own folk on Wisdom's hill. The Germans in the north were\nchurlish, but frank and honest; in the south, kindly and honest too.\nTheir general blot is drunkenness, the which they carry even to mislike\nand contempt of sober men. They say commonly, 'Kanstu niecht sauffen und\nfressen so kanstu kienem hern wol dienen.' In England, the vulgar sort\ndrink as deep, but the worshipful hold excess in this a reproach, and\ndrink a health or two for courtesy, not gluttony, and still sugar the\nwine. In their cups the Germans use little mirth or discourse, but ply\nthe business sadly, crying 'Seyte frolich!' The best of their drunken\nsport is 'Kurlemurlehuff,' a way of drinking with touching deftly of the\nglass, the beard, the table, in due turn, intermixed with whistlings\nand snappings of the finger so curiously ordered as 'tis a labour of\nHercules, but to the beholder right pleasant and mirthful. Their topers,\nby advice of German leeches, sleep with pebbles in their mouths. For,\nas of a boiling pot the lid must be set ajar, so with these fleshy\nwine-pots, to vent the heat of their inward parts: spite of which many\ndie suddenly from drink; but 'tis a matter of religion to slur it, and\ngloze it, and charge some innocent disease therewith. Yet 'tis more a\ncustom than very nature, for their women come among the tipplers, and\ndo but stand a moment, and as it were, kiss the wine-cup; and are indeed\nmost temperate in eating and drinking, and of all women, modest and\nvirtuous, and true spouses and friends to their mates; far before our\nHolland lasses, that being maids, put the question to the men, and being\nwived, do lord it over them. Why, there is a wife in Tergou, not far\nfrom our door. One came to the house and sought her man. Says she,\n'You'll not find him: he asked my leave to go abroad this afternoon, and\nI did give it him.'\"\n\nCatherine. \"'Tis sooth! 'tis sooth! 'Twas Beck Hulse, Jonah's wife. This\ncomes of a woman wedding a boy.\"\n\n\"In the south where wine is, the gentry drink themselves bare; but not\nin the north: for with beer a noble shall sooner burst his body than\nmelt his lands. They are quarrelsome, but 'tis the liquor, not the mind;\nfor they are none revengeful. And when they have made a bad bargain\ndrunk, they stand to it sober. They keep their windows bright; and\njudge a man by his clothes. Whatever fruit or grain or herb grows by the\nroadside, gather and eat. The owner seeing you shall say, 'Art welcome,\nhonest man.' But an ye pluck a wayside grape, your very life is in\njeopardy. 'Tis eating of that Heaven gave to be drunken. The French are\nmuch fairer spoken, and not nigh so true-hearted. Sweet words cost them\nnought. They call it payer en blanche.\"\n\nDenys. \"Les coquins! ha! ha!\"\n\n\"Natheless, courtesy is in their hearts, ay, in their very blood. They\nsay commonly, 'Give yourself the trouble of sitting down.' And such\nstraws of speech show how blows the wind. Also at a public show, if you\nwould leave your seat, yet not lose it, tie but your napkin round the\nbench, and no French man or woman will sit here; but rather keep the\nplace for you.\"\n\nCatherine. \"Gramercy! that is manners. France for me!\"\n\nDenys rose and placed his hand gracefully to his breastplate.\n\n\"Natheless, they say things in sport which are not courteous, but\nshocking. 'Le diable t'emporte!' 'Allez au diable!' and so forth. But\nI trow they mean not such dreadful wishes: custom belike. Moderate in\ndrinking, and mix water with their wine, and sing and dance over their\ncups, and are then enchanting company. They are curious not to drink\nin another man's cup. In war the English gain the better of them in the\nfield; but the French are their masters in attack and defence of cities;\nwitness Orleans, where they besieged their besiegers and hashed them\nsore with their double and treble culverines; and many other sieges in\nthis our century. More than all nations they flatter their women, and\ndespise them. No. She may be their sovereign ruler. Also they often hang\ntheir female malefactors, instead of drowning them decently, as other\nnations use. The furniture in their inns is walnut, in Germany only\ndeal. French windows are ill. The lower half is of wood, and opens; the\nupper half is of glass, but fixed; so that the servant cannot come at\nit to clean it. The German windows are all glass, and movable, and shine\nfar and near like diamonds. In France many mean houses are not glazed\nat all. Once I saw a Frenchman pass a church without unbonneting. This\nI ne'er witnessed in Holland, Germany, or Italy. At many inns they show\nthe traveller his sheets, to give him assurance they are clean, and warm\nthem at the fire before him; a laudable custom. They receive him kindly\nand like a guest; they mostly cheat him, and whiles cut his throat.\nThey plead in excuse hard and tyrannous laws. And true it is their law\nthrusteth its nose into every platter, and its finger into every pie.\nIn France worshipful men wear their hats and their furs indoors, and\ngo abroad lighter clad. In Germany they don hat and furred cloak to go\nabroad; but sit bareheaded and light clad round the stove.\n\n\"The French intermix not the men and women folk in assemblies, as we\nHollanders use. Round their preachers the women sit on their heels in\nrows, and the men stand behind them. Their harvests are rye, and flax,\nand wine. Three mules shall you see to one horse, and whole flocks of\nsheep as black as coal.\n\n\"In Germany the snails be red. I lie not. The French buy minstrelsy,\nbut breed jests, and make their own mirth. The Germans foster their set\nfools, with ear-caps, which move them to laughter by simulating madness;\na calamity that asks pity, not laughter. In this particular I deem that\nlighter nation wiser than the graver German. What sayest thou? Alas!\ncanst not answer me now.\n\n\"In Germany the petty laws are wondrous wise and just. Those against\ncriminals, bloody. In France bloodier still; and executed a trifle more\ncruelly there. Here the wheel is common, and the fiery stake; and under\nthis king they drown men by the score in Paris river, Seine yclept. But\nthe English are as peremptory in hanging and drowning for a light fault;\nso travellers report. Finally, a true-hearted Frenchman, when ye chance\non one, is a man as near perfect as earth affords; and such a man is my\nDenys, spite of his foul mouth.\"\n\nDenys. \"My foul mouth! Is that so writ, Master Richart?\"\n\nRichart. \"Ay, in sooth; see else.\"\n\nDenys (inspecting the letter gravely). \"I read not the letter so.\"\n\nRichart. \"How then?\"\n\nDenys. \"Humph! ahem why just the contrary.\" He added: \"'Tis kittle work\nperusing of these black scratches men are agreed to take for words. And\nI trow 'tis still by guess you clerks do go, worthy sir. My foul mouth!\nThis is the first time e'er I heard on't. Eh, mesdames?\"\n\nBut the females did not seize the opportunity he gave them, and burst\ninto a loud and general disclaimer. Margaret blushed and said nothing;\nthe other two bent silently over their work with something very like a\nsly smile. Denys inspected their countenances long and carefully. And\nthe perusal was so satisfactory, that he turned with a tone of injured,\nbut patient innocence, and bade Richart read on.\n\n\"The Italians are a polished and subtle people. They judge a man, not by\nhis habits, but his speech and gesture. Here Sir Chough may by no\nmeans pass for falcon gentle, as did I in Germany, pranked in my noble\nservant's feathers. Wisest of all nations in their singular temperance\nof food and drink. Most foolish of all to search strangers coming into\ntheir borders, and stay them from bringing much money in. They should\nrather invite it, and like other nations, let the traveller from taking\nof it out. Also here in Venice the dames turn their black hair yellow by\nthe sun and art, to be wiser than Him who made them. Ye enter no Italian\ntown without a bill of health, though now is no plague in Europe. This\npeevishness is for extortion's sake. The innkeepers cringe and fawn, and\ncheat, and in country places murder you. Yet will they give you clean\nsheets by paying therefor. Delicate in eating, and abhor from putting\ntheir hand in the plate; sooner they will apply a crust or what not.\nThey do even tell of a cardinal at Rome, which armeth his guest's left\nhand with a little bifurcal dagger to hold the meat, while his knife\ncutteth it. But methinks this, too, is to be wiser than Him, who made\nthe hand so supple and prehensile.\"\n\nEli. \"I am of your mind, my lad.\"\n\n\"They are sore troubled with the itch. And ointment for it, unguento per\nla rogna, is cried at every corner of Venice. From this my window I saw\nan urchin sell it to three several dames in silken trains, and to two\nvelvet knights.\"\n\nCatherine. \"Italy, my lass, I rede ye wash your body i' the tub\no' Sundays; and then ye can put your hand i' the plate o' Thursday\nwithouten offence.\"\n\n\"Their bread is lovely white. Their meats they spoil with sprinkling\ncheese over them; O, perversity! Their salt is black; without a lie. In\ncommerce these Venetians are masters of the earth and sea; and govern\ntheir territories wisely. Only one flaw I find; the same I once heard\na learned friar cast up against Plato his republic: to wit, that here\nwomen are encouraged to venal frailty, and do pay a tax to the State,\nwhich, not content with silk and spice, and other rich and honest\nfreights, good store, must trade in sin. Twenty thousand of these\nJezebels there be in Venice and Candia, and about, pampered and honoured\nfor bringing strangers to the city, and many live in princely palaces of\ntheir own. But herein methinks the politic signors of Venice forget what\nKing David saith, 'Except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh\nbut in vain.' Also, in religion, they hang their cloth according to the\nwind, siding now with the Pope, now with the Turk; but aye with the god\nof traders, mammon hight. Shall flower so cankered bloom to the world's\nend? But since I speak of flowers, this none may deny them, that they\nare most cunning in making roses and gilliflowers to blow unseasonably.\nIn summer they nip certain of the budding roses and water them not. Then\nin winter they dig round these discouraged plants, and put in cloves;\nand so with great art rear sweet-scented roses, and bring them to market\nin January. And did first learn this art of a cow. Buds she grazed in\nsummer, and they sprouted at yule. Women have sat in the doctors' chairs\nat their colleges. But she that sat in St. Peter's was a German. Italy\ntoo, for artful fountains and figures that move by water and enact life.\nAnd next for fountains is Augsburg, where they harness the foul knave\nSmoke to good Sir Spit, and he turneth stout Master Roast. But lest any\none place should vaunt, two towns there be in Europe, which, scorning\ngiddy fountains, bring water tame in pipes to every burgher's door, and\nhe filleth his vessels with but turning of a cock. One is London,\nso watered this many a year by pipes of a league from Paddington, a\nneighbouring city; and the other is the fair town of Lubeck. Also the\nfierce English are reported to me wise in that they will not share their\nland and flocks with wolves; but have fairly driven those marauders into\ntheir mountains. But neither in France, nor Germany, nor Italy, is a\nwayfarer's life safe from the vagabones after sundown. I can hear of no\nglazed house in all Venice; but only oiled linen and paper; and behind\nthese barbarian eyelets, a wooden jalosy. Their name for a cowardly\nassassin is 'a brave man,' and for an harlot, 'a courteous person,'\nwhich is as much as to say that a woman's worst vice, and a man's worst\nvice, are virtues. But I pray God for little Holland that there an\nassassin may be yclept an assassin, and an harlot an harlot, till\ndomesday; and then gloze foul faults with silken names who can!\"\n\nEli (with a sigh). \"He should have been a priest, saving your presence,\nmy poor lass.\"\n\n\"January 26.--Sweetheart, I must be brief, and tell thee but a part of\nthat I have seen, for this day my journal ends. To-night it sails for\nthee, and I, unhappy, not with it, but to-morrow, in another ship, to\nRome.\n\n\"Dear Margaret, I took a hand litter, and was carried to St. Mark his\nchurch. Outside it, towards the market-place, is a noble gallery, and\nabove it four famous horses, cut in brass by the ancient Romans, and\nseem all moving, and at the very next step must needs leap down on the\nbeholder. About the church are six hundred pillars of marble, porphyry,\nand ophites. Inside is a treasure greater than either, at St. Denys,\nor Loretto, or Toledo. Here a jewelled pitcher given the seigniory by a\nPersian king, also the ducal cap blazing with jewels, and on its crown\na diamond and a chrysolite, each as big as an almond; two golden crowns\nand twelve golden stomachers studded with jewels, from Constantinople;\nitem, a monstrous sapphire; item, a great diamond given by a French\nking; item, a prodigious carbuncle; item, three unicorns' horns. But\nwhat are these compared with the sacred relics?\n\n\"Dear Margaret, I stood and saw the brazen chest that holds the body of\nSt. Mark the Evangelist. I saw with these eyes and handled his ring, and\nhis gospel written with his own hand, and all my travels seemed light;\nfor who am I that I should see such things? Dear Margaret, his sacred\nbody was first brought from Alexandria, by merchants in 810, and then\nnot prized as now; for between 829, when this church was builded, and\n1094, the very place where it lay was forgotten. Then holy priests\nfasted and prayed many days seeking for light, and lo! the Evangelist's\nbody brake at midnight through the marble and stood before them. They\nfell to the earth; but in the morning found the crevice the sacred body\nhad burst through, and peering through it saw him lie. Then they took\nand laid him in his chest beneath the altar, and carefully put back the\nstone with its miraculous crevice, which crevice I saw, and shall gape\nfor a monument while the world lasts. After that they showed me the\nVirgin's chair, it is of stone; also her picture, painted by St. Luke,\nvery dark, and the features now scarce visible. This picture, in time of\ndrought, they carry in procession, and brings the rain. I wish I had\nnot seen it. Item, two pieces of marble spotted with John the Baptist's\nblood; item, a piece of the true cross, and of the pillar to which\nChrist was tied; item, the rock struck by Moses, and wet to this hour;\nalso a stone Christ sat on, preaching at Tyre; but some say it is the\none the patriarch Jacob laid his head on, and I hold with them, by\nreason our Lord never preached at Tyre. Going hence, they showed me\nthe state nursery for the children of those aphrodisian dames, their\nfavourites. Here in the outer wall was a broad niche, and if they bring\nthem so little as they can squeeze them through it alive, the bairn\nfalls into a net inside, and the state takes charge of it, but if too\nbig, their mothers must even take them home again, with whom abiding\n'tis like to be mali corvi mali ovum. Coming out of the church we met\nthem carrying in a corpse, with the feet and face bare. This I then\nfirst learned is Venetian custom, and sure no other town will ever rob\nthem of it, nor of this that follows. On a great porphyry slab in the\npiazza were three ghastly heads rotting and tainting the air, and in\ntheir hot summers like to take vengeance with breeding of a plague.\nThese were traitors to the state, and a heavy price--two thousand\nducats--being put on each head, their friends had slain them and brought\nall three to the slab, and so sold blood of others and their own faith.\nNo state buys heads so many, nor pays half so high a price for that\nsorry merchandise. But what I most admired was to see over against the\nDuke's palace a fair gallows in alabaster, reared express to bring him,\nand no other, for the least treason to the state; and there it stands in\nhis eye whispering him memento mori. I pondered, and owned these signors\nmy masters, who will let no man, not even their sovereign, be above the\ncommon weal. Hard by, on a wall, the workmen were just finishing, by\norder of the seigniory, the stone effigy of a tragical and enormous act\nenacted last year, yet on the wall looks innocent. Here two gentle folks\nwhisper together, and there other twain, their swords by their side.\nFour brethren were they, which did on either side conspire to poison the\nother two, and so halve their land in lieu of quartering it; and at a\nmutual banquet these twain drugged the wine, and those twain envenomed a\nmarchpane, to such good purpose that the same afternoon lay four 'brave\nmen' around one table grovelling in mortal agony, and cursing of one\nanother and themselves, and so concluded miserably, and the land, for\nwhich they had lost their immortal souls, went into another family. And\nwhy not? it could not go into a worse.\n\n\"But O, sovereign wisdom of bywords! how true they put the finger on\neach nation's, or particular's, fault.\n\n     \"Quand Italie sera sans poison\n     Et France sans trahison\n     Et l'Angleterre sans guerre,\n     Lors sera le monde sans terre.\"\n\nRichart explained this to Catherine, then proceeded: \"And after this\nthey took me to the quay, and presently I espied among the masts one\ngarlanded with amaranth flowers. 'Take me thither,' said I, and I let\nmy guide know the custom of our Dutch skippers to hoist flowers to\nthe masthead when they are courting a maid. Oft had I scoffed at this\nsaying, 'So then his wooing is the earth's concern. But now, so far from\nthe Rotter, that bunch at a masthead made my heart leap with assurance\nof a countryman. They carried me, and oh, Margaret! on the stern of that\nDutch boy, was written in muckle letters,\n\nRICHART ELIASSOEN, AMSTERDAM.\n\n'Put me down,' I said; 'for our Lady's sake put me down.' I sat on the\nbank and looked, scarce believing my eyes, and looked, and presently\nfell to crying, till I could see the words no more. Ah me, how they went\nto my heart, those bare letters in a foreign land. Dear Richart! good,\nkind brother Richart! often I have sat on his knee and rid on his back.\nKisses many he has given me, unkind word from him had I never. And there\nwas his name on his own ship, and his face and all his grave, but good\nand gentle ways, came back to me, and I sobbed vehemently, and cried\naloud, 'Why, why is not brother Richart here, and not his name only?' I\nspake in Dutch, for my heart was too full to hold their foreign tongues,\nand\n\nEli. \"Well, Richart, go on, lad, prithee go on. Is this a place to halt\nat?\"\n\nRichart. \"Father, with my duty to you, it is easy to say go on, but\nthink ye I am not flesh and blood? The poor boy's--simple grief and\nbrotherly love coming--so sudden-on me, they go through my heart and--I\ncannot go on; sink me if I can even see the words, 'tis writ so fine.\"\n\nDenys. \"Courage, good Master Richart! Take your time. Here are more eyne\nwet than yours. Ah, little comrade! would God thou wert here, and I at\nVenice for thee.\"\n\nRichart. \"Poor little curly-headed lad, what had he done that we have\ndriven him so far?\"\n\n\"That is what I would fain know,\" said Catherine drily, then fell to\nweeping and rocking herself, with her apron over her head.\n\n\"Kind dame, good friends,\" said Margaret trembling, \"let me tell you\nhow the letter ends. The skipper hearing our Gerard speak his grief in\nDutch, accosted him, and spake comfortably to him; and after a while\nour Gerard found breath to say he was worthy Master Richart's brother.\nThereat was the good skipper all agog to serve him.\"\n\nRichart. \"So! so! skipper! Master Richart aforesaid will be at thy\nwedding and bring's purse to boot.\"\n\nMargaret. \"Sir, he told Gerard of his consort that was to sail that\nvery night for Rotterdam; and dear Gerard had to go home and finish his\nletter and bring it to the ship. And the rest, it is but his poor dear\nwords of love to me, the which, an't please you, I think shame to hear\nthem read aloud, and ends with the lines I sent to Mistress Kate, and\nthey would sound so harsh now and ungrateful.\"\n\nThe pleading tone, as much as the words, prevailed, and Richart said he\nwould read no more aloud, but run his eye over it for his own brotherly\nsatisfaction. She blushed and looked uneasy, but made no reply.\n\n\"Eli,\" said Catherine, still sobbing a little, \"tell me, for our Lady's\nsake, how our poor boy is to live at that nasty Rome. He is gone there\nto write, but here he his own words to prove writing avails nought: a\nhad died o' hunger by the way but for paint-brush and psaltery. Well\na-day!\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Eli, \"he has got brush and music still. Besides, so many\nmen so many minds. Writing, though it had no sale in other parts, may be\nmerchandise at Rome.\"\n\n\"Father,\" said little Kate, \"have I your good leave to put in my word\n'twixt mother and you?\"\n\n\"And welcome, little heart.\"\n\n\"Then, seems to me, painting and music, close at hand, be stronger than\nwriting, but being distant, nought to compare; for see what glamour\nwritten paper hath done here but now. Our Gerard, writing at Venice,\nhath verily put his hand into this room at Rotterdam, and turned all\nour hearts. Ay, dear dear Gerard, methinks thy spirit hath rid hither on\nthese thy paper wings; and oh! dear father, why not do as we should do\nwere he here in the body?\"\n\n\"Kate,\" said Eli, \"fear not; Richart and I will give him glamour for\nglamour. We will write him a letter, and send it to Rome by a sure hand\nwith money, and bid him home on the instant.\"\n\nCornelis and Sybrandt exchanged a gloomy look.\n\n\"Ah, good father! And meantime?\"\n\n\"Well, meantime?\"\n\n\"Dear father, dear mother, what can we do to pleasure the absent, but be\nkind to his poor lass; and her own trouble afore her?\"\n\n\"'Tis well!\" said Eli; \"but I am older than thou.\" Then he turned\ngravely to Margaret: \"Wilt answer me a question, my pretty mistress?\"\n\n\"If I may, sir,\" faltered Margaret.\n\n\"What are these marriage lines Gerard speaks of in the letter?\"\n\n\"Our marriage lines, sir. His and mine. Know you not that we are\nbetrothed?\"\n\n\"Before witnesses?\"\n\n\"Ay, sure. My poor father and Martin Wittenhaagen.\"\n\n\"This is the first I ever heard of it. How came they in his hands? They\nshould be in yours.\"\n\n\"Alas, sir, the more is my grief; but I ne'er doubted him; and he said\nit was a comfort to him to have them in his bosom.\"\n\n\"Y'are a very foolish lass.\"\n\n\"Indeed I was, sir. But trouble teaches the simple.\"\n\n\"'Tis a good answer. Well, foolish or no, y'are honest. I had shown ye\nmore respect at first, but I thought y'had been his leman, and that is\nthe truth.\"\n\n\"God forbid, sir! Denys, methinks 'tis time for us to go. Give me my\nletter, sir!\"\n\n\"Bide ye! bide ye! be not so hot for a word! Natheless, wife, methinks\nher red cheek becomes her.\"\n\n\"Better than it did you to give it her, my man.\"\n\n\"Softly, wife, softly. I am not counted an unjust man though I be\nsomewhat slow.\"\n\nHere Richart broke in. \"Why, mistress, did ye shed your blood for our\nGerard?\"\n\n\"Not I, sir. But maybe I would.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay. But he says you did. Speak sooth now!\"\n\n\"Alas! I know not what ye mean. I rede ye believe not all that my poor\nlad says of me. Love makes him blind.\"\n\n\"Traitress!\" cried Denys. \"Let not her throw dust in thine eyes,\nMaster Richart. Old Martin tells me ye need not make signals to me,\nshe-comrade; I am as blind as love--Martin tells me she cut her arm, and\nlet her blood flow, and smeared her heels when Gerard was hunted by the\nbloodhounds, to turn the scent from her lad.\"\n\n\"Well, and if I did, 'twas my own, and spilled for the good of my own,\"\nsaid Margaret defiantly. But Catherine suddenly clasping her, she began\nto cry at having found a bosom to cry on, of one who would have also\nshed her blood for Gerard in danger.\n\nEli rose from his chair. \"Wife,\" said he solemnly, \"you will set another\nchair at our table for every meal: also another plate and knife. They\nwill be for Margaret and Peter. She will come when she likes, and stay\naway when she pleases. None may take her place at my left hand. Such as\ncan welcome her are welcome to me. Such as cannot, I force them not to\nabide with me. The world is wide and free. Within my walls I am master,\nand my son's betrothed is welcome.\"\n\nCatherine bustled out to prepare supper. Eli and Richart sat down and\nconcocted a letter to bring Gerard home. Richart promised it should go\nby sea to Rome that very week. Sybrandt and Cornelis exchanged a gloomy\nwink, and stole out. Margaret, seeing Giles deep in meditation, for the\ndwarf's intelligence had taken giant strides, asked him to bring her the\nletter. \"You have heard but half, good master Giles,\" said she. \"Shall I\nread you the rest?\"\n\n\"I shall be much beholden to you,\" shouted the sonorous atom.\n\nShe gave him her stool: curiosity bowed his pride to sit on it; and\nMargaret murmured the first part of the letter into his ear very low,\nnot to disturb Eli and Richart. And to do this, she leaned forward and\nput her lovely face cheek by jowl with Giles's hideous one: a strange\ncontrast, and worth a painter's while to try and represent. And in this\nattitude Catherine found her, and all the mother warmed towards her, and\nshe exchanged an eloquent glance with little Kate.\n\nThe latter smiled, and sewed, with drooping lashes.\n\n\"Get him home on the instant,\" roared Giles. \"I'll make a man of him.\"\n\n\"Hear the boy!\" said Catherine, half comically, half proudly.\n\n\"We hear him,\" said Richart; \"a mostly makes himself heard when a do\nspeak.\"\n\nSybrandt. \"Which will get to him first?\"\n\nCornelis (gloomily). \"Who can tell?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV\n\nAbout two months before this scene in Eli's home, the natives of a\nlittle' maritime place between Naples and Rome might be seen flocking to\nthe sea beach, with eyes cast seaward at a ship, that laboured against a\nstiff gale blowing dead on the shore.\n\nAt times she seemed likely to weather the danger, and then the\nspectators congratulated her aloud: at others the wind and sea drove\nher visibly nearer, and the lookers-on were not without a secret\nsatisfaction they would not have owned even to themselves.\n\n     Non quia vexari quemquam est jucunda voluptas\n     Sed quibus ipse malis careas quia cernere suave est.\n\nAnd the poor ship, though not scientifically built for sailing, was\nadmirably constructed for going ashore, with her extravagant poop that\ncaught the wind, and her lines like a cocked hat reversed. To those\non the beach that battered labouring frame of wood seemed alive, and\nstruggling against death with a panting heart. But could they have been\ntransferred to her deck they would have seen she had not one beating\nheart but many, and not one nature but a score were coming out clear in\nthat fearful hour.\n\nThe mariners stumbled wildly about the deck, handling the ropes as each\nthought fit, and cursing and praying alternately.\n\nThe passengers were huddled together round the mast, some sitting, some\nkneeling, some lying prostrate, and grasping the bulwarks as the vessel\nrolled and pitched in the mighty waves. One comely young man, whose ashy\ncheek, but compressed lips, showed how hard terror was battling in him\nwith self-respect, stood a little apart, holding tight by a shroud, and\nwincing at each sea. It was the ill-fated Gerard. Meantime prayers and\nvows rose from the trembling throng amid-ships, and to hear them,\nit seemed there were almost as many gods about as men and women. The\nsailors, indeed, relied on a single goddess. They varied her titles\nonly, calling on her as \"Queen of Heaven,\" \"Star of the Sea,\" \"Mistress\nof the World,\" \"Haven of Safety.\" But among the landsmen Polytheism\nraged. Even those who by some strange chance hit on the same divinity\ndid not hit on the same edition of that divinity. An English merchant\nvowed a heap of gold to our lady of Walsingham. But a Genoese merchant\nvowed a silver collar of four pounds to our lady of Loretto; and a\nTuscan noble promised ten pounds of wax lights to our lady of Ravenna;\nand with a similar rage for diversity they pledged themselves, not on\nthe true Cross, but on the true Cross in this, that, or the other modern\ncity.\n\nSuddenly a more powerful gust than usual catching the sail at a\ndisadvantage, the rotten shrouds gave way, and the sail was torn out\nwith a loud crack, and went down the wind smaller and smaller, blacker\nand blacker, and fluttered into the sea, half a mile off, like a sheet\nof paper, and ere the helmsman could put the ship's head before the\nwind, a wave caught her on the quarter and drenched the poor wretches to\nthe bone, and gave them a foretaste of chill death. Then one vowed aloud\nto turn Carthusian monk, if St. Thomas would save him. Another would\ngo a pilgrim to Compostella, bareheaded, barefooted, with nothing but\na coat of mail on his naked skin, if St. James would save him. Others\ninvoked Thomas, Dominic, Denys, and above all, Catherine of Sienna.\n\nTwo petty Neapolitan traders stood shivering.\n\nOne shouted at the top of his voice, \"I vow to St. Christopher at Paris\na waxen image of his own weight, if I win safe to land.\"\n\nOn this the other nudged him, and said, \"Brother, brother, take heed\nwhat you vow. Why, if you sell all you have in the world by public\nauction, 'twill not buy his weight in wax.\"\n\n\"Hold your tongue, you fool,\" said the vociferator. Then in a whisper:\n\n\"Think ye I am in earnest? Let me but win safe to land, I'll not give\nhim a rush dip.\"\n\nOthers lay flat and prayed to the sea.\n\n\"Oh, most merciful sea! oh, sea most generous! oh! bountiful sea! oh,\nbeautiful sea! be gentle, be kind, preserve us in this hour of peril.\"\n\nAnd others wailed and moaned in mere animal terror each time the\nill-fated ship rolled or pitched more terribly than usual; and she was\nnow a mere plaything in the arms of the tremendous waves.\n\nA Roman woman of the humbler class sat with her child at her half-bared\nbreast, silent amid that wailing throng: her cheek ashy pale; her eye\ncalm; and her lips moved at times in silent prayer, but she neither\nwept, nor lamented, nor bargained with the gods. Whenever the ship\nseemed really gone under their feet, and bearded men squeaked, she\nkissed her child; but that was all. And so she sat patient, and suckled\nhim in death's jaws; for why should he lose any joy she could give him;\nmoribundo? Ay, there I do believe, sat Antiquity among those mediaevals.\nSixteen hundred years had not tainted the old Roman blood in her veins;\nand the instinct of a race she had perhaps scarce heard of taught her to\ndie with decent dignity.\n\nA gigantic friar stood on the poop with feet apart, like the Colossus of\nRhodes, not so much defying, as ignoring, the peril that surrounded him.\nHe recited verses from the Canticles with a loud unwavering voice; and\ninvited the passengers to confess to him. Some did so on their knees,\nand he heard them and laid his hands on them, and absolved them as if\nhe had been in a snug sacristy, instead of a perishing ship. Gerard got\nnearer and nearer to him, by the instinct that takes the wavering to\nthe side of the impregnable. And in truth, the courage of heroes facing\nfleshly odds might have paled by the side of that gigantic friar, and\nhis still more gigantic composure. Thus, even here, two were found who\nmaintained the dignity of our race: a woman, tender, yet heroic, and a\nmonk steeled by religion against mortal fears.\n\nAnd now, the sail being gone, the sailors cut down the useless mast a\nfoot above the board, and it fell with its remaining hamper over the\nship's side. This seemed to relieve her a little.\n\nBut now the hull, no longer impelled by canvas, could not keep ahead of\nthe sea. It struck her again and again on the poop, and the tremendous\nblows seemed given by a rocky mountain, not by a liquid.\n\nThe captain left the helm and came amidships pale as death. \"Lighten\nher,\" he cried. \"Fling all overboard, or we shall founder ere we strike,\nand lose the one little chance we have of life.\" While the sailors were\nexecuting this order, the captain, pale himself, and surrounded by pale\nfaces that demanded to know their fate, was talking as unlike an English\nskipper in like peril as can well be imagined. \"Friends,\" said he, \"last\nnight when all was fair, too fair, alas! there came a globe of fire\nclose to the ship. When a pair of them come it is good luck, and nought\ncan drown her that voyage. We mariners call these fiery globes Castor\nand Pollux. But if Castor come without Pollux, or Pollux without Castor,\nshe is doomed. Therefore, like good Christians, prepare to die.\"\n\nThese words were received with a loud wail.\n\nTo a trembling inquiry how long they had to prepare, the captain\nreplied, \"She may, or may not, last half an hour; over that, impossible;\nshe leaks like a sieve; bustle, men, lighten her.\"\n\nThe poor passengers seized on everything that was on deck and flung\nit overboard. Presently they laid hold of a heavy sack; an old man was\nlying on it, sea sick. They lugged it from under him. It rattled. Two\nof them drew it to the side; up started the owner, and with an unearthly\nshriek, pounced on it. \"Holy Moses! what would you do? 'Tis my all;\n'tis the whole fruits of my journey; silver candlesticks, silver plates,\nbrooches, hanaps--\"\n\n\"Let go, thou hoary villain,\" cried the others; \"shall all our lives be\nlost for thy ill-gotten gear?\" \"Fling him in with it,\" cried one; \"'tis\nthis Ebrew we Christian men are drowned for.\" Numbers soon wrenched it\nfrom him, and heaved it over the side. It splashed into the waves. Then\nits owner uttered one cry of anguish, and stood glaring, his white hair\nstreaming in the wind, and was going to leap after it, and would, had\nit floated. But it sank, and was gone for ever; and he staggered to and\nfro, tearing his hair, and cursed them and the ship, and the sea, and\nall the powers of heaven and hell alike.\n\nAnd now the captain cried out: \"See, there is a church in sight. Steer\nfor that church, mate, and you, friends, pray to the saint, whoe'er he\nbe.\"\n\nSo they steered for the church and prayed to the unknown god it was\nnamed after. A tremendous sea pooped them, broke the rudder, and jammed\nit immovable, and flooded the deck.\n\nThen wild with superstitious terror some of them came round Gerard.\n\"Here is the cause of all,\" they cried. \"He has never invoked a single\nsaint. He is a heathen; here is a pagan aboard.\"\n\n\"Alas, good friends, say not so,\" said Gerard, his teeth chattering with\ncold and fear. \"Rather call these heathens, that lie a praying to\nthe sea. Friends, I do honour the saints--but I dare not pray to them\nnow--there is no time--(oh!) what avail me Dominic, and Thomas, and\nCatherine? Nearer God's throne than these St. Peter sitteth; and if I\npray to him, it's odd, but I shall be drowned ere he has time to plead\nmy cause with God. Oh! oh! oh! I must need go straight to Him that made\nthe sea, and the saints, and me. Our Father which art in heaven, save\nthese poor souls and me that cry for the bare life! Oh, sweet Jesus,\npitiful Jesus, that didst walk Genezaret when Peter sank, and wept for\nLazarus dead when the apostles' eyes were dry, oh, save poor Gerard--for\ndear Margaret's sake!\"\n\nAt this moment the sailors were seen preparing to desert the sinking\nship in the little boat, which even at that epoch every ship carried;\nthen there was a rush of egotists; and thirty souls crowded into it.\nRemained behind three who were bewildered, and two who were paralyzed,\nwith terror. The paralyzed sat like heaps of wet rags, the bewildered\nones ran to and fro, and saw the thirty egotists put off, but made no\nattempt to join them: only kept running to and fro, and wringing their\nhands. Besides these there was one on his knees, praying over the wooden\nstatue of the Virgin Mary, as large as life, which the sailors had\nreverently detached from the mast. It washed about the deck, as the\nwater came slushing in from the sea, and pouring out at the scuppers;\nand this poor soul kept following it on his knees, with his hands\nclasped at it, and the water playing with it. And there was the Jew\npalsied, but not by fear. He was no longer capable of so petty a\npassion. He sat cross-legged, bemoaning his bag, and whenever the\nspray lashed him, shook his fist at where it came from, and cursed the\nNazarenes, and their gods, and their devils, and their ships, and their\nwaters, to all eternity.\n\nAnd the gigantic Dominican, having shriven the whole ship, stood calmly\ncommuning with his own spirit. And the Roman woman sat pale and patient,\nonly drawing her child closer to her bosom as death came nearer.\n\nGerard saw this, and it awakened his manhood.\n\n\"See! see!\" he said, \"they have ta'en the boat and left the poor woman\nand her child to perish.\"\n\nHis heart soon set his wit working.\n\n\"Wife, I'll save thee yet, please God.\" And he ran to find a cask or a\nplank to float her. There was none.\n\nThen his eye fell on the wooden image of the Virgin. He caught it up in\nhis arms, and heedless of a wail that issued from its worshipper like a\nchild robbed of its toy, ran aft with it. \"Come, wife,\" he cried.\n\"I'll lash thee and the child to this. 'Tis sore worm eaten, but 'twill\nserve.\"\n\nShe turned her great dark eye on him and said a single word:\n\n\"Thyself?!\"\n\nBut with wonderful magnanimity and tenderness.\n\n\"I am a man, and have no child to take care of.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said she, and his words seemed to animate her face with a desire\nto live. He lashed the image to her side. Then with the hope of life she\nlost something of her heroic calm; not much: her body trembled a little,\nbut not her eye.\n\nThe ship was now so low in the water that by using an oar as a lever he\ncould slide her into the waves.\n\n\"Come,\" said he, \"while yet there is time.\"\n\nShe turned her great Roman eyes, wet now, upon him. \"Poor youth!--God\nforgive me!--My child!\" And he launched her on the surge, and with his\noar kept her from being battered against the ship.\n\nA heavy hand fell on him; a deep sonorous voice sounded in his ear:\n\"'Tis well. Now come with me.\"\n\nIt was the gigantic friar.\n\nGerard turned, and the friar took two strides, and laid hold of the\nbroken mast. Gerard did the same, obeying him instinctively. Between\nthem, after a prodigious effort, they hoisted up the remainder of the\nmast, and carried it off. \"Fling it in,\" said the friar, \"and follow\nit.\" They flung it in; but one of the bewildered passengers had run\nafter them, and jumped first and got on one end. Gerard seized the\nother, the friar the middle.\n\nIt was a terrible situation. The mast rose and plunged with each wave\nlike a kicking horse, and the spray flogged their faces mercilessly, and\nblinded them: to help knock them off.\n\nPresently was heard a long grating noise ahead. The ship had struck, and\nsoon after, she being stationary now, they were hurled against her with\ntremendous force. Their companion's head struck against the upper part\nof the broken rudder with a horrible crack, and was smashed like a\ncocoa-nut by a sledge-hammer. He sunk directly, leaving no trace but\na red stain on the water, and a white clot on the jagged rudder, and a\ndeath cry ringing in their ears, as they drifted clear under the lee of\nthe black hull. The friar uttered a short Latin prayer for the safety of\nhis soul, and took his place composedly. They rolled along; one moment\nthey saw nothing, and seemed down in a mere basin of watery hills: the\nnext they caught glimpses of the shore speckled bright with people,\nwho kept throwing up their arms with wild Italian gestures to encourage\nthem, and the black boat driving bottom upwards, and between it and\nthem the woman rising and falling like themselves. She had come across a\npaddle, and was holding her child tight with her left arm, and paddling\ngallantly with her right.\n\nWhen they had tumbled along thus a long time, suddenly the friar said\nquietly--\n\n\"I touched the ground.\"\n\n\"Impossible, father,\" said Gerard; \"we are more than a hundred yards\nfrom shore. Prithee, prithee, leave not our faithful mast.\"\n\n\"My son,\" said the friar, \"you speak prudently. But know that I have\nbusiness of Holy Church on hand, and may not waste time floating when\nI can walk, in her service. There I felt it with my toes again; see the\nbenefit of wearing sandals, and not shoon. Again; and sandy. Thy\nstature is less than mine: keep to the mast! I walk.\" He left the mast\naccordingly and extending his powerful arms, rushed through the water.\nGerard soon followed him. At each overpowering wave the monk stood like\na tower, and closing his mouth, threw his head back to encounter it, and\nwas entirely lost under it awhile: then emerged and ploughed lustily on.\nAt last they came close to the shore; but the suction outward baffled\nall their attempts to land. Then the natives sent stout fishermen into\nthe sea, holding by long spears in a triple chain; and so dragged them\nashore.\n\nThe friar shook himself, bestowed a short paternal benediction on the\nnatives, and went on to Rome, with eyes bent on earth according to his\nrule, and without pausing. He did not even cast a glance back upon that\nsea, which had so nearly engulfed him, but had no power to harm him,\nwithout his Master's leave.\n\nWhile he stalks on alone to Rome without looking back, I who am not in\nthe service of Holy Church, stop a moment to say that the reader and\nI were within six inches of this giant once before; but we escaped him\nthat time. Now I fear we are in for him. Gerard grasped every hand upon\nthe beach. They brought him to an enormous fire, and with a delicacy\nhe would hardly have encountered in the north, left him to dry himself\nalone: on this he took out of his bosom a parchment, and a paper, and\ndried them carefully. When this was done to his mind, and not till then,\nhe consented to put on a fisherman's dress and leave his own by the\nfire, and went down to the beach. What he saw may be briefly related.\n\nThe captain stuck by the ship, not so much from gallantry, as from a\nconviction that it was idle to resist Castor or Pollux, whichever it was\nthat had come for him in a ball of fire.\n\nNevertheless the sea broke up the ship and swept the poop, captain and\nall, clear of the rest, and took him safe ashore. Gerard had a principal\nhand in pulling him out of the water. The disconsolate Hebrew landed on\nanother fragment, and on touching earth, offered a reward for his bag,\nwhich excited little sympathy, but some amusement. Two more were saved\non pieces of the wreck. The thirty egotists came ashore, but one at\na time, and dead; one breathed still. Him the natives, with excellent\nintentions, took to a hot fire. So then he too retired from this\nshifting scene.\n\nAs Gerard stood by the sea, watching, with horror and curiosity mixed,\nhis late companions washed ashore, a hand was laid lightly on his\nshoulder. He turned. It was the Roman matron, burning with womanly\ngratitude. She took his hand gently, and raising it slowly to her lips,\nkissed it; but so nobly, she seemed to be conferring an honour on one\ndeserving hand. Then with face all beaming and moist eyes, she held her\nchild up and made him kiss his preserver.\n\nGerard kissed the child more than once. He was fond of children. But he\nsaid nothing. He was much moved; for she did not speak at all, except\nwith her eyes, and glowing cheeks, and noble antique gesture, so large\nand stately. Perhaps she was right. Gratitude is not a thing of words.\nIt was an ancient Roman matron thanking a modern from her heart of\nhearts.\n\nNext day towards afternoon, Gerard--twice as old as last year, thrice\nas learned in human ways, a boy no more, but a man who had shed blood in\nself-defence, and grazed the grave by land and sea--reached the Eternal\nCity; post tot naufragia tutus.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI\n\nGerard took a modest lodging on the west bank of the Tiber, and every\nday went forth in search of work, taking a specimen round to every shop\nhe could hear of that executed such commissions.\n\nThey received him coldly. \"We make our letter somewhat thinner than\nthis,\" said one. \"How dark your ink is,\" said another. But the main cry\nwas, \"What avails this? Scant is the Latin writ here now. Can ye not\nwrite Greek?\"\n\n\"Ay, but not nigh so well as Latin.\"\n\n\"Then you shall never make your bread at Rome.\"\n\nGerard borrowed a beautiful Greek manuscript at a high price, and went\nhome with a sad hole in his purse, but none in his courage.\n\nIn a fortnight he had made vast progress with the Greek character;\nso then, to lose no time, he used to work at it till noon, and hunt\ncustomers the rest of the day.\n\nWhen he carried round a better Greek specimen than any they possessed,\nthe traders informed him that Greek and Latin were alike unsaleable; the\ncity was thronged with works from all Europe. He should have come last\nyear.\n\nGerard bought a psaltery. His landlady, pleased with his looks and\nmanners, used often to speak a kind word in passing. One day she made\nhim dine with her, and somewhat to his surprise asked him what had\ndashed his spirits. He told her. She gave him her reading of the matter.\n\"Those sly traders,\" she would be bound, \"had writers in their pay,\nfor whose work they received a noble price, and paid a sorry one. So no\nwonder they blow cold on you. Methinks you write too well. How know I\nthat? say you. Marry--marry, because you lock not your door, like the\nchurl Pietro, and women will be curious. Ay, ay, you write too well for\nthem.\"\n\nGerard asked an explanation.\n\n\"Why,\" said she, \"your good work might put out the eyes of that they are\nselling.\"\n\nGerard sighed. \"Alas! dame, you read folk on the ill side, and you so\nkind and frank yourself.\"\n\n\"My dear little heart, these Romans are a subtle race. Me? I am a\nSiennese, thanks to the Virgin.\"\n\n\"My mistake was leaving Augsburg,\" said Gerard.\n\n\"Augsburg?\" said she haughtily: \"is that a place to even to Rome? I\nnever heard of it, for my part.\"\n\nShe then assured him that he should make his fortune in spite of the\nbooksellers. \"Seeing thee a stranger, they lie to thee without sense or\ndiscretion. Why, all the world knows that our great folk are bitten with\nthe writing spider this many years, and pour out their money like water,\nand turn good land and houses into writ sheepskins, to keep in a chest\nor a cupboard. God help them, and send them safe through this fury, as\nHe hath through a heap of others; and in sooth hath been somewhat less\ncutting and stabbing among rival factions, and vindictive eating of\ntheir opposites' livers, minced and fried, since Scribbling came in.\nWhy, I can tell you two. There is his eminence Cardinal Bassarion, and\nhis holiness the Pope himself. There be a pair could keep a score such\nas thee a writing night and day. But I'll speak to Teresa; she hears the\ngossip of the court.\"\n\nThe next day she told him she had seen Teresa, and had heard of five\nmore signors who were bitten with the writing spider. Gerard took down\ntheir names, and bought parchment, and busied himself for some days in\npreparing specimens. He left one, with his name and address, at each of\nthese signors' doors, and hopefully awaited the result.\n\nThere was none.\n\nDay after day passed and left him heartsick.\n\nAnd strange to say this was just the time when Margaret was fighting so\nhard against odds to feed her male dependents at Rotterdam, and arrested\nfor curing without a licence instead of killing with one.\n\nGerard saw ruin staring him in the face.\n\nHe spent the afternoons picking up canzonets and mastering them. He laid\nin playing cards to colour, and struck off a meal per day.\n\nThis last stroke of genius got him into fresh trouble.\n\nIn these \"camere locande\" the landlady dressed all the meals, though\nthe lodgers bought the provisions. So Gerard's hostess speedily detected\nhim, and asked him if he was not ashamed himself: by which brusque\nopening, having made him blush and look scared, she pacified herself\nall in a moment, and appealed to his good sense whether Adversity was a\nthing to be overcome on an empty stomach.\n\n\"Patienza, my lad! times will mend; meantime I will feed you for the\nlove of heaven.\" (Italian for \"gratis.\")\n\n\"Nay, hostess,\" said Gerard, \"my purse is not yet quite void, and it\nwould add to my trouble an if true folk should lose their due by me.\"\n\n\"Why, you are as mad as your neighbour Pietro, with his one bad\npicture.\"\n\n\"Why, how know you 'tis a bad picture?\"\n\n\"Because nobody will buy it. There is one that hath no gift. He will\nhave to don casque and glaive, and carry his panel for a shield.\"\n\nGerard pricked up his ears at this: so she told him more. Pietro had\ncome from Florence with money in his purse, and an unfinished picture;\nhad taken her one unfurnished room, opposite Gerard's, and furnished\nit neatly. When his picture was finished, he received visitors and had\noffers for it: though in her opinion liberal ones, he had refused so\ndisdainfully as to make enemies of his customers. Since then he had\noften taken it out with him to try and sell, but had always brought it\nback; and the last month, she had seen one movable after another go out\nof his room, and now he wore but one suit, and lay at night on a great\nchest. She had found this out only by peeping through the keyhole, for\nhe locked the door most vigilantly whenever he went out. \"Is he afraid\nwe shall steal his chest, or his picture, that no soul in all Rome is\nweak enough to buy?\"\n\n\"Nay, sweet hostess; see you not 'tis his poverty he would screen from\nview?\"\n\n\"And the more fool he! Are all our hearts as ill as his? A might give us\na trial first, anyway.\"\n\n\"How you speak of him. Why, his case is mine; and your countryman to\nboot.\"\n\n\"Oh, we Siennese love strangers. His case yours? Nay, 'tis just the\ncontrary. You are the comeliest youth ever lodged in this house; hair\nlike gold: he is a dark, sour-visaged loon. Besides, you know how to\ntake a woman on her better side; but not he. Natheless, I wish he would\nnot starve to death in my house, to get me a bad name. Anyway, one\nstarveling is enough in any house. You are far from home, and it is for\nme, which am the mistress here, to number your meals--for me and the\nDutch wife, your mother, that is far away: we two women shall settle\nthat matter. Mind thou thine own business, being a man, and leave\ncooking and the like to us, that are in the world for little else that\nI see but to roast fowls, and suckle men at starting, and sweep their\ngrownup cobwebs.\"\n\n\"Dear kind dame, in sooth you do often put me in mind of my mother that\nis far away.\"\n\n\"All the better; I'll put you more in mind of her before I have done\nwith you.\" And the honest soul beamed with pleasure.\n\nGerard not being an egotist, nor blinded by female partialities, saw his\nown grief in poor proud Pietro; and the more he thought of it the more\nhe resolved to share his humble means with that unlucky artist; Pietro's\nsympathy would repay him. He tried to waylay him; but without success.\n\nOne day he heard a groaning in the room. He knocked at the door, but\nreceived no answer. He knocked again. A surly voice bade him enter.\n\nHe obeyed somewhat timidly, and entered a garret furnished with a chair,\na picture, face to wall, an iron basin, an easel, and a long chest,\non which was coiled a haggard young man with a wonderfully bright eye.\nAnything more like a coiled cobra ripe for striking the first comer was\nnever seen.\n\n\"Good Signor Pietro,\" said Gerard, \"forgive me that, weary of my own\nsolitude, I intrude on yours; but I am your nighest neighbour in this\nhouse, and methinks your brother in fortune. I am an artist too.\"\n\n\"You are a painter? Welcome, signer. Sit down on my bed.\"\n\nAnd Pietro jumped off and waved him into the vacant throne with a\nmagnificent demonstration of courtesy.\n\nGerard bowed, and smiled; but hesitated a little. \"I may not call\nmyself a painter. I am a writer, a caligraph. I copy Greek and Latin\nmanuscripts, when I can get them to copy.\"\n\n\"And you call that an artist?\"\n\n\"Without offence to your superior merit, Signor Pietro.\"\n\n\"No offence, stranger, none. Only, meseemeth an artist is one who\nthinks, and paints his thought. Now a caligraph but draws in black and\nwhite the thoughts of another.\"\n\n\"'Tis well distinguished, signor. But then, a writer can write the\nthoughts of the great ancients, and matters of pure reason, such as\nno man may paint: ay, and the thoughts of God, which angels could not\npaint. But let that pass. I am a painter as well; but a sorry one.\"\n\n\"The better thy luck. 'They will buy thy work in Rome.\"\n\n\"But seeking to commend myself to one of thy eminence, I thought it well\nrather to call myself a capable writer, than a scurvy painter.\"\n\nAt this moment a step was heard on the stair. \"Ah! 'tis the good dame,\"\ncried Gerard. \"What oh! hostess, I am here in conversation with Signor\nPietro. I dare say he will let me have my humble dinner here.\"\n\nThe Italian bowed gravely.\n\nThe landlady brought in Gerard's dinner smoking and savoury. She put the\ndish down on the bed with a face divested of all expression, and went.\n\nGerard fell to. But ere he had eaten many mouthfuls, he stopped, and\nsaid: \"I am an ill-mannered churl, Signor Pietro. I ne'er eat to my mind\nwhen I eat alone. For our Lady's sake put a spoon into this ragout with\nme; 'tis not unsavoury, I promise you.\"\n\nPietro fixed his glittering eye on him.\n\n\"What, good youth, thou a stranger, and offerest me thy dinner?\"\n\n\"Why, see, there is more than one can eat.\"\n\n\"Well, I accept,\" said Pietro; and took the dish with some appearance of\ncalmness, and flung the contents out of window.\n\nThen he turned, trembling with mortification and ire, and said: \"Let\nthat teach thee to offer alms to an artist thou knowest not, master\nwriter.\"\n\nGerard's face flushed with anger, and it cost him a bitter struggle not\nto box this high-souled creature's ears. And then to go and destroy\ngood food! His mother's milk curdled in his veins with horror at such\nimpiety. Finally, pity at Pietro's petulance and egotism, and a touch of\nrespect for poverty-struck pride, prevailed.\n\nHowever, he said coldly, \"Likely what thou hast done might pass in a\nnovel of thy countryman, Signor Boccaccio; but 'twas not honest.\"\n\n\"Make that good!\" said the painter sullenly.\n\n\"I offered thee half my dinner; no more. But thou hast ta'en it all.\nHadst a right to throw away thy share, but not mine. Pride is well, but\njustice is better.\"\n\nPietro stared, then reflected.\n\n\"'Tis well. I took thee for a fool, so transparent was thine artifice.\nForgive me! And prithee leave me! Thou seest how 'tis with me. The world\nhath soured me. I hate mankind. I was not always so. Once more excuse\nthat my discourtesy, and fare thee well.\"\n\nGerard sighed, and made for the door.\n\nBut suddenly a thought struck him. \"Signor Pietro,\" said he, \"we\nDutchmen are hard bargainers. We are the lads 'een eij scheeren,' that\nis, 'to shave an egg.' Therefore, I, for my lost dinner, do claim to\nfeast mine eyes on your picture, whose face is toward the wall.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" said the painter hastily, \"ask me not that; I have already\nmisconducted myself enough towards thee. I would not shed thy blood.\"\n\n\"Saints forbid! My blood?\"\n\n\"Stranger,\" said Pietro sullenly, \"irritated by repeated insults to my\npicture, which is my child, my heart, I did in a moment of rage make a\nsolemn vow to drive my dagger into the next one that should flout it,\nand the labour and love that I have given to it.\"\n\n\"What, are all to be slain that will not praise this picture?\" and he\nlooked at its back with curiosity.\n\n\"Nay, nay; if you would but look at it, and hold your parrot tongues.\nBut you will be talking. So I have turned it to the wall for ever. Would\nI were dead, and buried in it for my coffin!\"\n\nGerard reflected.\n\n\"I accept the condition. Show me the picture! I can but hold my peace.\"\n\nPietro went and turned its face, and put it in the best light the room\nafforded, and coiled himself again on his chest, with his eye, and\nstiletto, glittering.\n\nThe picture represented the Virgin and Christ, flying through the air in\na sort of cloud of shadowy cherubic faces; underneath was a landscape,\nforty or fifty miles in extent, and a purple sky above.\n\nGerard stood and looked at it in silence. Then he stepped close, and\nlooked. Then he retired as far off as he could, and looked; but said not\na word.\n\nWhen he had been at this game half an hour, Pietro cried out querulously\nand somewhat inconsistently: \"well, have you not a word to say about\nit?\"\n\nGerard started. \"I cry your mercy; I forgot there were three of us here.\nAy, I have much to say.\" And he drew his sword.\n\n\"Alas! alas!\" cried Pietro, jumping in terror from his lair. \"What\nwouldst thou?\"\n\n\"Marry, defend myself against thy bodkin, signor; and at due odds,\nbeing, as aforesaid, a Dutchman. Therefore, hold aloof, while I deliver\njudgment, or I will pin thee to the wall like a cockchafer.\"\n\n\"Oh! is that all?\" said Pietro, greatly relieved. \"I feared you were\ngoing to stab my poor picture with your sword, stabbed already by so\nmany foul tongues.\"\n\nGerard \"pursued criticism under difficulties.\" Put himself in a position\nof defence, with his sword's point covering Pietro, and one eye glancing\naside at the picture. \"First, signor, I would have you know that, in\nthe mixing of certain colours, and in the preparation of your oil, you\nItalians are far behind us Flemings. But let that flea stick. For as\nsmall as I am, I can show you certain secrets of the Van Eycks, that you\nwill put to marvellous profit in your next picture. Meantime I see in\nthis one the great qualities of your nation. Verily, ye are solis filii.\nIf we have colour, you have imagination. Mother of Heaven! an he hath\nnot flung his immortal soul upon the panel. One thing I go by is this;\nit makes other pictures I once admired seem drossy, earth-born things.\nThe drapery here is somewhat short and stiff, why not let it float\nfreely, the figures being in air and motion?\n\n\"I will! I will!\" cried Pietro eagerly. \"I will do anything for those\nwho will but see what I have done.\"\n\n\"Humph! This landscape it enlightens me. Henceforth I scorn those little\nhuddled landscapes that did erst content me. Here is nature's very face:\na spacious plain, each distance marked, and every tree, house, figure,\nfield, and river smaller and less plain, by exquisite gradation, till\nvision itself melts into distance. O, beautiful! And the cunning rogue\nhath hung his celestial figure in air out of the way of his little world\nbelow. Here, floating saints beneath heaven's purple canopy. There,\nfar down, earth and her busy hives. And they let you take this painted\npoetry, this blooming hymn, through the streets of Rome and bring it\nhome unsold. But I tell thee in Ghent or Bruges, or even in Rotterdam,\nthey would tear it out of thy hands. But it is a common saying that a\nstranger's eye sees clearest. Courage, Pietro Vanucci! I reverence thee\nand though myself a scurvy painter, do forgive thee for being a great\none. Forgive thee? I thank God for thee and such rare men as thou art;\nand bow the knee to thee in just homage. Thy picture is immortal, and\nthou, that hast but a chest to sit on, art a king in thy most royal art.\nViva, il maestro! Viva!\"\n\nAt this unexpected burst the painter, with all the abandon of his\nnation, flung himself on Gerard's neck. \"They said it was a maniac's\ndream,\" he sobbed.\n\n\"Maniacs themselves! no, idiots!\" shouted Gerard.\n\n\"Generous stranger! I will hate men no more since the world hath such as\nthee. I was a viper to fling thy poor dinner away; a wretch, a monster.\"\n\n\"Well, monster, wilt be gentle now, and sup with me?\"\n\n\"Ah! that I will. Whither goest thou?\"\n\n\"To order supper on the instant. We will have the picture for third\nman.\"\n\n\"I will invite it whiles thou art gone. My poor picture, child of my\nheart.\"\n\n\"Ah, master, 'twill look on many a supper after the worms have eaten you\nand me.\"\n\n\"I hope so,\" said Pietro.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII\n\nAbout a week after this the two friends sat working together, but not in\nthe same spirit. Pietro dashed fitfully at his, and did wonders in a few\nminutes, and then did nothing, except abuse it; then presently resumed\nit in a fury, to lay it down with a groan. Through all which kept calmly\nworking, calmly smiling, the canny Dutchman.\n\nTo be plain, Gerard, who never had a friend he did not master, had put\nhis Onagra in harness. The friends were painting playing cards to boil\nthe pot.\n\nWhen done, the indignant master took up his picture to make his daily\ntour in search of a customer.\n\nGerard begged him to take the cards as well, and try and sell them.\nHe looked all the rattle-snake, but eventually embraced Gerard in the\nItalian fashion, and took them, after first drying the last-finished\nones in the sun, which was now powerful in that happy clime.\n\nGerard, left alone, executed a Greek letter or two, and then mended\na little rent in his hose. His landlady found him thus employed, and\ninquired ironically whether there were no women in the house.\n\n\"When you have done that,\" said she \"come and talk to Teresa, my friend\nI spoke to thee of, that hath a husband not good for much, which brags\nhis acquaintance with the great.\"\n\nGerard went down, and who should Teresa be but the Roman matron.\n\n\"Ah, madama,\" said he, \"is it you? The good dame told me not that. And\nthe little fair-haired boy, is he well is he none the worse for his\nvoyage in that strange boat?\"\n\n\"He is well,\" said the matron.\n\n\"Why, what are you two talking about?\" said the landlady, staring at\nthem both in turn; \"and why tremble you so, Teresa mia?\"\n\n\"He saved my child's life,\" said Teresa, making an effort to compose\nherself.\n\n\"What! my lodger? and he never told me a word of that. Art not ashamed\nto look me in the face?\"\n\n\"Alas! speak not harshly to him,\" said the matron. She then turned to\nher friend and poured out a glowing description of Gerard's conduct,\nduring which Gerard stood blushing like a girl, and scarce recognizing\nhis own performance, gratitude painted it so fair.\n\n\"And to think thou shouldst ask me to serve thy lodger, of whom I knew\nnought but that he had thy good word, oh, Fiammina; and that was enough\nfor me. Dear youth, in serving thee I serve myself.\"\n\nThen ensued an eager description, by the two women, of what had been\ndone, and what should be done, to penetrate the thick wall of fees,\ncommissions, and chicanery, which stood between the patrons of art and\nan unknown artist in the Eternal City.\n\nTeresa smiled sadly at Gerard's simplicity in leaving specimens of his\nskill at the doors of the great.\n\n\"What!\" said she, \"without promising the servants a share--without even\nfeeing them, to let the signors see thy merchandise! As well have flung\nit into Tiber.\"\n\n\"Well-a-day!\" sighed Gerard. \"Then how is an artist to find a patron?\nfor artists are poor, not rich.\"\n\n\"By going to some city nobler and not so greedy as this,\" said Teresa.\n\"La corte Romana non vuol' pecora senza lana.\"\n\nShe fell into thought, and said she would come again to-morrow.\n\nThe landlady felicitated Gerard. \"Teresa has got something in her head,\"\nsaid she.\n\nTeresa was scarce gone when Pietro returned with his picture, looking\nblack as thunder. Gerard exchanged a glance with the landlady, and\nfollowed him upstairs to console him.\n\n\"What, have they let thee bring home thy masterpiece?\"\n\n\"As heretofore.\"\n\n\"More fools they, then.\"\n\n\"That is not the worse.\"\n\n\"Why, what is the matter?\"\n\n\"They have bought the cards,\" yelled Pietro, and hammered the air\nfuriously right and left.\n\n\"All the better,\" said Gerard cheerfully.\n\n\"They flew at me for them. They were enraptured with them. They tried\nto conceal their longing for them, but could not. I saw, I feigned, I\npillaged; curse the boobies.\"\n\nAnd he flung down a dozen small silver coins on the floor and jumped\non them, and danced on them with basilisk eyes, and then kicked them\nassiduously, and sent them spinning and flying, and running all abroad.\nDown went Gerard on his knees, and followed the maltreated innocents\ndirectly, and transferred them tenderly to his purse.\n\n\"Shouldst rather smile at their ignorance, and put it to profit,\" said\nhe.\n\n\"And so I will,\" said Pietro, with concentrated indignation. \"The\nbrutes! We will paint a pack a day; we will set the whole city gambling\nand ruining itself, while we live like princes on its vices and\nstupidity. There was one of the queens, though, I had fain have kept\nback. 'Twas you limned her, brother. She had lovely red-brown hair and\nsapphire eyes, and above all, soul.\"\n\n\"Pietro,\" said Gerard softly, \"I painted that one from my heart.\"\n\nThe quick-witted Italian nodded, and his eyes twinkled.\n\n\"You love her so well, yet leave her.\"\n\n\"Pietro, it is because I love her so dear that I have wandered all this\nweary road.\"\n\nThis interesting colloquy was interrupted by the landlady crying from\nbelow, \"Come down, you are wanted.\" He went down, and there was Teresa\nagain.\n\n\"Come with me, Ser Gerard.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVIII\n\nGerard walked silently beside Teresa, wondering in his own mind, after\nthe manner of artists, what she was going to do with him; instead of\nasking her. So at last she told him of her own accord. A friend had\ninformed her of a working goldsmith's wife who wanted a writer. \"Her\nshop is hard by; you will not have far to go.\"\n\nAccordingly they soon arrived at the goldsmith's wife.\n\n\"Madama,\" said Teresa, \"Leonora tells me you want a writer: I have\nbrought you a beautiful one; he saved my child at sea. Prithee look on\nhim with favour.\"\n\nThe goldsmith's wife complied in one sense. She fixed her eyes on\nGerard's comely face, and could hardly take them off again. But her\nreply was unsatisfactory. \"Nay, I have no use for a writer. Ah! I mind\nnow, it is my gossip, Claelia, the sausage-maker, wants one; she told\nme, and I told Leonora.\"\n\nTeresa made a courteous speech and withdrew.\n\nClaelia lived at some distance, and when they reached her house she was\nout. Teresa said calmly, \"I will await her return,\" and sat so still,\nand dignified, and statuesque, that Gerard was beginning furtively to\ndraw her, when Claelia returned.\n\n\"Madama, I hear from the goldsmith's wife, the excellent Olympia,\nthat you need a writer\" (here she took Gerard by the hand and led him\nforward); \"I have brought you a beautiful one; he saved my child from\nthe cruel waves. For our Lady's sake look with favour on him.\"\n\n\"My good dame, my fair Ser,\" said Claelia, \"I have no use for a writer;\nbut now you remind me, it was my friend Appia Claudia asked me for one\nbut the other day. She is a tailor, lives in the Via Lepida.\"\n\nTeresa retired calmly.\n\n\"Madama,\" said Gerard, \"this is likely to be a tedious business for\nyou.\"\n\nTeresa opened her eyes.\n\n\"What was ever done without a little patience?\" She added mildly, \"We\nwill knock at every door at Rome but you shall have justice.\"\n\n\"But, madama, I think we are dogged. I noticed a man that follows us,\nsometimes afar, sometimes close.\"\n\n\"I have seen it,\" said Teresa coldly; but her cheek coloured faintly.\n\"It is my poor Lodovico.\"\n\nShe stopped and turned, and beckoned with her finger.\n\nA figure approached them somewhat unwillingly.\n\nWhen he came up, she gazed him full in the face, and he looked sheepish.\n\n\"Lodovico mio,\" said she, \"know this young Ser, of whom I have so often\nspoken to thee. Know him and love him, for he it was who saved thy wife\nand child.\"\n\nAt these last words Lodovico, who had been bowing and grinning\nartificially, suddenly changed to an expression of heartfelt gratitude,\nand embraced Gerard warmly.\n\nYet somehow there was something in the man's original manner, and his\nhaving followed his wife by stealth, that made Gerard uncomfortable\nunder this caress. However, he said, \"We shall have your company, Ser\nLodovico?\"\n\n\"No, signor,\" replied Lodovico, \"I go not on that side Tiber.\"\n\n\"Addio, then,\" said Teresa significantly.\n\n\"When shall you return home, Teresa mia?\"\n\n\"When I have done mine errand, Lodovico.\"\n\nThey pursued their way in silence. Teresa now wore a sad and almost\ngloomy air.\n\nTo be brief, Appia Claudia was merciful, and did not send them over\nTiber again, but only a hundred yards down the street to Lucretia, who\nkept the glove shop; she it was wanted a writer; but what for, Appia\nClaudia could not conceive. Lucretia was a merry little dame, who\nreceived them heartily enough, and told them she wanted no writer, kept\nall her accounts in her head. \"It was for my confessor, Father Colonna;\nhe is mad after them.\"\n\n\"I have heard of his excellency,\" said Teresa.\n\n\"Who has not?\"\n\n\"But, good dame, he is a friar; he has made vow of poverty. I cannot let\nthe young man write and not be paid. He saved my child at sea.\n\n\"Did he now?\" And Lucretia cast an approving look on Gerard. \"Well, make\nyour mind easy; a Colonna never wants for money. The good father has\nonly to say the word, and the princes of his race will pour a thousand\ncrowns into his lap. And such a confessor, dame! the best in Rome. His\nhead is leagues and leagues away all the while; he never heeds what you\nare saying. Why, I think no more of confessing my sins to him than of\ntelling them to that wall. Once, to try him, I confessed, along with\nthe rest, as how I had killed my lodger's little girl and baked her in\na pie. Well, when my voice left off confessing, he started out of his\ndream, and says he, a mustering up a gloom, 'My erring sister, say three\nPaternosters and three Ave Marias kneeling, and eat no butter nor eggs\nnext Wednesday, and pax vobiscum!' and off a went with his hands behind\nhim, looking as if there was no such thing as me in the world.\"\n\nTeresa waited patiently, then calmly brought this discursive lady back\nto the point: \"Would she be so kind as go with this good youth to the\nfriar and speak for him?\"\n\n\"Alack! how can I leave my shop? And what need? His door is aye open to\nwriters, and painters, and scholars, and all such cattle. Why, one day\nhe would not receive the Duke d'Urbino, because a learned Greek was\ncloseted with him, and the friar's head and his so close together over a\ndusty parchment just come in from Greece, as you could put one cowl over\nthe pair. His wench Onesta told me. She mostly looks in here for a chat\nwhen she goes an errand.\"\n\n\"This is the man for thee, my friend,\" said Teresa.\n\n\"All you have to do,\" continued Lucretia, \"is to go to his lodgings (my\nboy shall show them you), and tell Onesta you come from me, and you are\na writer, and she will take you up to him. If you put a piece of silver\nin the wench's hand, 'twill do you no harm: that stands to reason.\"\n\n\"I have silver,\" said Teresa warmly.\n\n\"But stay,\" said Lucretia, \"mind one thing. What the young man saith he\ncan do, that he must be able to do, or let him shun the good friar like\npoison. He is a very wild beast against all bunglers. Why, 'twas but\nt'other day, one brought him an ill-carved crucifix. Says he, 'Is this\nhow you present \"Salvator Mundi?\" who died for you in mortal agony; and\nyou go and grudge him careful work. This slovenly gimcrack, a crucifix?\nBut that it is a crucifix of some sort, and I am a holy man, I'd dust\nyour jacket with your crucifix,' says he. Onesta heard every word\nthrough the key-hole; so mind.\"\n\n\"Have no fears, madama,\" said Teresa loftily. \"I will answer for his\nability; he saved my child.\"\n\nGerard was not subtle enough to appreciate this conclusion; and was so\nfar from sharing Teresa's confidence that he begged a respite. He would\nrather not go to the friar to-day: would not to-morrow do as well?\n\n\"Here is a coward for ye,\" said Lucretia.\n\n\"No, he is not a coward,\" said Teresa, firing up; \"he is modest.\"\n\n\"I am afraid of this high-born, fastidious friar,\" said Gerard,\n\"Consider he has seen the handiwork of all the writers in Italy, dear\ndame Teresa; if you would but let me prepare a better piece of work than\nyet I have done, and then to-morrow I will face him with it.\"\n\n\"I consent,\" said Teresa.\n\nThey walked home together.\n\nNot far from his own lodging was a shop that sold vellum. There was a\nbeautiful white skin in the window. Gerard looked at it wistfully; but\nhe knew he could not pay for it; so he went on rather hastily. However,\nhe soon made up his mind where to get vellum, and parting with Teresa at\nhis own door, ran hastily upstairs, and took the bond he had brought all\nthe way from Sevenbergen, and laid it with a sigh on the table. He then\nprepared with his chemicals to erase the old writing; but as this was\nhis last chance of reading it, he now overcame his deadly repugnance\nto bad writing, and proceeded to decipher the deed in spite of its\ndetestable contractions. It appeared by this deed that Ghysbrecht Van\nSwieten was to advance some money to Floris Brandt on a piece of land,\nand was to repay himself out of the rent.\n\nOn this Gerard felt it would be imprudent and improper to destroy the\ndeed. On the contrary, he vowed to decipher every word, at his leisure.\nHe went downstairs, determined to buy a small piece of vellum with his\nhalf of the card-money.\n\nAt the bottom of the stairs he found the landlady and Teresa talking. At\nsight of him the former cried, \"Here he is. You are caught, donna mia.\nSee what she has bought you?\" And whipped out from under her apron the\nvery skin of vellum Gerard had longed for.\n\n\"Why, dame! why, donna Teresa!\" And he was speechless with pleasure and\nastonishment.\n\n\"Dear donna Teresa, there is not a skin in all Rome like it. However\ncame you to hit on this one? 'Tis glamour.\"\n\n\"Alas, dear boy, did not thine eye rest on it with desire? and didst thou\nnot sigh in turning away from it? And was it for Teresa to let thee want\nthe thing after that?\"\n\n\"What sagacity! what goodness, madama! Oh, dame, I never thought I\nshould possess this. What did you pay for it?\"\n\n\"I forget. Addio, Fiammina. Addio, Ser Gerard. Be happy, be prosperous,\nas you are good.\" And the Roman matron glided away while Gerard was\nhesitating, and thinking how to offer to pay so stately a creature for\nher purchase.\n\nThe next day in the afternoon he went to Lucretia, and her boy took him\nto Fra Colonna's lodgings. He announced his business, and feed Onesta,\nand she took him up to the friar. Gerard entered with a beating heart.\nThe room, a large one, was strewed and heaped with objects of art,\nantiquity, and learning, lying about in rich profusion, and confusion.\nManuscripts, pictures, carvings in wood and ivory, musical instruments;\nand in this glorious chaos sat the friar, poring intently over an\nArabian manuscript.\n\nHe looked up a little peevishly at the interruption. Onesta whispered in\nhis ear.\n\n\"Very well,\" said he. \"Let him be seated. Stay; young man, show me how\nyou write?\" And he threw Gerard a piece of paper, and pointed to an\ninkhorn.\n\n\"So please you, reverend father,\" said Gerard, \"my hand it trembleth too\nmuch at this moment; but last night I wrote a vellum page of Greek, and\nthe Latin version by its side, to show the various character.\"\n\n\"Show it me?\"\n\nGerard brought the work to him in fear and trembling; then stood\nheart-sick, awaiting his verdict.\n\nWhen it came it staggered him. For the verdict was, a Dominican falling\non his neck.\n\nThe next day an event took place in Holland, the effect of which on\nGerard's destiny, no mortal at the time, nor even my intelligent reader\nnow, could, I think, foresee.\n\nMarched up to Eli's door a pageant brave to the eye of sense, and to the\nvulgar judgment noble, but to the philosophic, pitiable more or less.\n\nIt looked one animal, a centaur; but on severe analysis proved two. The\nhuman half were sadly bedizened with those two metals, to clothe his\ncarcass with which and line his pouch, man has now and then disposed of\nhis soul: still the horse was the vainer brute of the two; he was far\nworse beflounced, bebonneted, and bemantled, than any fair lady regnante\ncrinolina. For the man, under the colour of a warming-pan, retained\nNature's outline. But it was subaudi equum! Scarce a pennyweight of\nhonest horse-flesh to be seen. Our crinoline spares the noble parts of\nwomen, and makes but the baser parts gigantic (why this preference?);\nbut this poor animal from stem to stern was swamped in finery. His ears\nwere hid in great sheaths of white linen tipped with silver and blue.\nHis body swaddled in stiff gorgeous cloths descending to the ground,\nexcept just in front, where they left him room to mince. His tail,\nthough dear to memory, no doubt, was lost to sight, being tucked in\nheaven knows how. Only his eyes shone out like goggles, through two\nholes pierced in the wall of haberdashery, and his little front hoofs\npeeped in and out like rats.\n\nYet did this compound, gorgeous and irrational, represent power;\nabsolute power: it came straight from a tournament at the Duke's court,\nwhich being on a progress, lay last night at a neighbouring town--to\nexecute the behests of royalty.\n\n\"What ho!\" cried the upper half, and on Eli emerging, with his wife\nbehind him, saluted them. \"Peace be with you, good people. Rejoice! I am\ncome for your dwarf.\"\n\nEli looked amazed, and said nothing. But Catherine screamed over his\nshoulder, \"You have mistook your road, good man; here abides no dwarf.\"\n\n\"Nay, wife, he means our Giles, who is somewhat small of stature: why\ngainsay what gainsayed may not be?\"\n\n\"Ay!\" cried the pageant, \"that is he, and discourseth like the big\ntaber.\n\n\"His breast is sound for that matter,\" said Catherine sharply.\n\n\"And prompt with his fists though at long odds.\"\n\n\"Else how would the poor thing keep his head in such a world as this?\"\n\n\"'Tis well said, dame. Art as ready with thy weapon as he; art his\nmother, likely. So bring him forth, and that presently. See, they lead a\nstunted mule for him. The Duke hath need of him, sore need; we are clean\nout o' dwarven, and tiger-cats, which may not be, whiles earth them\nyieldeth. Our last hop o' my thumb tumbled down the well t'other day.\"\n\n\"And think you I'll let my darling go to such an ill-guided house as\nyou, where the reckless trollops of servants close not the well mouth,\nbut leave it open to trap innocents, like wolven?\"\n\nThe representative of autocracy lost patience at this unwonted\nopposition, and with stern look and voice bade her bethink her whether\nit was the better of the two; \"to have your abortion at court fed like a\nbishop and put on like a prince, or to have all your heads stricken off\nand borne on poles, with the bellman crying, 'Behold the heads of hardy\nrebels, which having by good luck a misbegotten son, did traitorously\ngrudge him to the Duke, who is the true father of all his folk, little\nor mickle?'\n\n\"Nay,\" said Eli sadly, \"miscall us not. We be true folk, and neither\nrebels nor traitors. But 'tis sudden, and the poor lad is our true flesh\nand blood, and hath of late given proof of more sense than heretofore.\"\n\n\"Avails not threatening our lives,\" whimpered Catherine; \"we grudge him\nnot to the Duke; but in sooth he cannot go; his linen is all in holes.\nSo there is an end.\"\n\nBut the male mind resisted this crusher.\n\n\"Think you the Duke will not find linen, and cloth of gold to boot? None\nso brave, none so affected, at court, as our monsters, big or wee.\"\n\nHow long the dispute might have lasted, before the iron arguments of\ndespotism achieved the inevitable victory, I know not; but it was cut\nshort by a party whom neither disputant had deigned to consult.\n\nThe bone of contention walked out of the house, and sided with monarchy.\n\n\"If my folk are mad, I am not,\" he roared. \"I'll go with you and on the\ninstant.\"\n\nAt this Catherine set up a piteous cry. She saw another of her brood\nescaping from under her wing into some unknown element. Giles was not\nquite insensible to her distress, so simple yet so eloquent. He said,\n\"Nay, take not on, mother! Why, 'tis a godsend. And I am sick of this,\never since Gerard left it.\"\n\n\"Ah, cruel Giles! Should ye not rather say she is bereaved of Gerard:\nthe more need of you to stay aside her and comfort her.\"\n\n\"Oh! I am not going to Rome. Not such a fool. I shall never be farther\nthan Rotterdam; and I'll often come and see you; and if I like not the\nplace, who shall keep me there? Not all the dukes in Christendom.\"\n\n\"Good sense lies in little bulk,\" said the emissary approvingly.\n\"Therefore, Master Giles, buss the old folk, and thank them for\nmisbegetting of thee; and ho! you--bring hither his mule.\"\n\nOne of his retinue brought up the dwarf mule. Giles refused it with\nscorn. And on being asked the reason, said it was not just.\n\n\"What! would ye throw all into one scale! Put muckle to muckle, and\nlittle to wee! Besides, I hate and scorn small things. I'll go on the\nhighest horse here, or not at all.\"\n\nThe pursuivant eyed him attentively a moment. He then adopted a\ncourteous manner. \"I shall study your will in all things reasonable.\n(Dismount, Eric, yours is the highest horse.) And if you would halt in\nthe town an hour or so, while you bid them farewell, say but the word,\nand your pleasure shall be my delight.\"\n\nGiles reflected.\n\n\"Master,\" said he, \"if we wait a month, 'twill be still the same: my\nmother is a good soul, but her body is bigger than her spirit. We shall\nnot part without a tear or two, and the quicker 'tis done the fewer; so\nbring yon horse to me.\"\n\nCatherine threw her apron over her face and sobbed. The high horse was\nbrought, and Giles was for swarming up his tail, like a rope; but one\nof the servants cried out hastily, \"Forbear, for he kicketh.\" \"I'll kick\nhim,\" said Giles. \"Bring him close beneath this window, and I'll learn\nyou all how to mount a horse which kicketh, and will not be clomb by\nthe tail, the staircase of a horse.\" And he dashed into the house, and\nalmost immediately reappeared at an upper window, with a rope in his\nhand. He fastened an end somehow, and holding the other, descended\nas swift and smooth as an oiled thunderbolt in a groove, and lighted\nastride his high horse as unperceived by that animal as a fly settling\non him.\n\nThe official lifted his hands to heaven in mawkish admiration. \"I have\ngotten a pearl,\" thought he, \"and wow but this will be a good day's work\nfor me.\"\n\n\"Come, father, come, mother, buss me, and bless me, and off I go.\"\n\nEli gave him his blessing, and bade him be honest and true, and a credit\nto his folk. Catherine could not speak, but clung to him with many sobs\nand embraces; and even through the mist of tears her eye detected in a\nmoment the little rent in his sleeve he had made getting out of window,\nand she whipped out her needle and mended it then and there, and her\ntears fell on his arm the while, unheeded--except by those unfleshly\neyes, with which they say the very air is thronged.\n\nAnd so the dwarf mounted the high horse, and rode away complacent with\nthe old hand laying the court butter on his back with a trowel.\n\nLittle recked Perpusillus of two poor silly females that sat by the\nbereaved hearth, rocking themselves, and weeping, and discussing all his\nvirtues, and how his mind had opened lately, and blind as two beetles to\nhis faults, who rode away from them, jocund and bold.\n\nIngentes animos angusto pectore versans.\n\nArrived at court he speedily became a great favourite.\n\nOne strange propensity of his electrified the palace; but on account\nof his small size, and for variety's sake, and as a monster, he was\nindulged on it. In a word, he was let speak the truth.\n\nIt is an unpopular thing.\n\nHe made it an intolerable one.\n\nBawled it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIX\n\nHappy the man who has two chain-cables: Merit, and Women.\n\nOh, that I, like Gerard, had a 'chaine des dames' to pull up by.\n\nI would be prose laureat, or professor of the spasmodic, or something,\nin no time. En attendant, I will sketch the Fra Colonna.\n\nThe true revivers of ancient learning and philosophy were two writers of\nfiction--Petrarch and Boccaccio.\n\nTheir labours were not crowned with great, public, and immediate\nsuccess; but they sowed the good seed; and it never perished, but\nquickened in the soil, awaiting sunshine.\n\nFrom their day Italy was never without a native scholar or two,\nversed in Greek; and each learned Greek who landed there was received\nfraternally. The fourteenth century, ere its close, saw the birth\nof Poggio, Valla, and the elder Guarino; and early in the fifteenth\nFlorence under Cosmo de Medici was a nest of Platonists. These, headed\nby Gemistus Pletho, a born Greek, began about A.D. 1440 to write down\nAristotle. For few minds are big enough to be just to great A without\nbeing unjust to capital B.\n\nTheodore Gaza defended that great man with moderation; George of\nTrebizond with acerbity, and retorted on Plato. Then Cardinal Bessarion,\nanother born Greek, resisted the said George, and his idol, in a tract\n\"Adversus calumniatorem Platonis.\"\n\nPugnacity, whether wise or not, is a form of vitality. Born without\ncontroversial bile in so zealous an epoch, Francesco Colonna, a young\nnobleman of Florence, lived for the arts. At twenty he turned Dominican\nfriar. His object was quiet study. He retired from idle company, and\nfaction fights, the humming and the stinging of the human hive, to St.\nDominic and the Nine Muses.\n\nAn eager student of languages, pictures, statues, chronology, coins,\nand monumental inscriptions. These last loosened his faith in popular\nhistories.\n\nHe travelled many years in the East, and returned laden with spoils;\nmaster of several choice MSS., and versed in Greek and Latin, Hebrew and\nSyriac. He found his country had not stood still. Other lettered princes\nbesides Cosmo had sprung up. Alfonso King of Naples, Nicolas d'Este,\nLionel d'Este, etc. Above all, his old friend Thomas of Sarzana had been\nmade Pope, and had lent a mighty impulse to letters; had accumulated\n5000 MSS. in the library of the Vatican, and had set Poggio to translate\nDiodorus Siculus and Xenophon's Cyropaedia, Laurentius Valla to\ntranslate Herodotus and Thucydides, Theodore Gaza, Theophrastus; George\nof Trebizond, Eusebius, and certain treatises of Plato, etc. etc.\n\nThe monk found Plato and Aristotle under armistice, but Poggio and\nValla at loggerheads over verbs and nouns, and on fire with odium\nphilologicum. All this was heaven; and he settled down in his native\nland, his life a rosy dream. None so happy as the versatile,\nprovided they have not their bread to make by it. And Fra Colonna was\nVersatility. He knew seven or eight languages, and a little mathematics;\ncould write a bit, paint a bit, model a bit, sing a bit, strum a bit;\nand could relish superior excellence in all these branches. For\nthis last trait he deserved to be as happy as he was. For, gauge the\nintellects of your acquaintances, and you will find but few whose minds\nare neither deaf, nor blind, nor dead to some great art or science--\n\n\"And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out.\"\n\nAnd such of them as are conceited as well as stupid shall even parade\ninstead of blushing for the holes in their intellects.\n\nA zealot in art, the friar was a sceptic in religion.\n\nIn every age there are a few men who hold the opinions of another age,\npast or future. Being a lump of simplicity, his sceptism was as naif as\nhis enthusiasm. He affected to look on the religious ceremonies of his\nday as his models, the heathen philosophers, regarded the worship of\ngods and departed heroes: mummeries good for the populace. But here his\nmind drew unconsciously a droll distinction. Whatever Christian ceremony\nhis learning taught him was of purely pagan origin, that he respected,\nout of respect for antiquity; though had he, with his turn of mind,\nbeen a pagan and its contemporary, he would have scorned it from his\nphilosophic heights.\n\nFra Colonna was charmed with his new artist, and having the run of half\nthe palaces in Rome, sounded his praises so, that he was soon called\nupon to resign him. He told Gerard what great princes wanted him. \"But I\nam so happy with you, father,\" objected Gerard. \"Fiddlestick about being\nhappy with me,\" said Fra Colonna; \"you must not be happy; you must be a\nman of the world; the grand lesson I impress on the young is, be a man\nof the world. Now these Montesini can pay you three times as much as I\ncan, and they shall too-by Jupiter.\"\n\nAnd the friar clapped a terrific price on Gerard's pen. It was acceded\nto without a murmur. Much higher prices were going for copying than\nauthorship ever obtained for centuries under the printing press.\n\nGerard had three hundred crowns for Aristotle's treatise on rhetoric.\n\nThe great are mighty sweet upon all their pets, while the fancy lasts;\nand in the rage for Greek MSS. the handsome writer soon became a pet,\nand nobles of both sexes caressed him like a lap dog.\n\nIt would have turned a vain fellow's head; but the canny Dutchman\nsaw the steel hand beneath the velvet glove, and did not presume.\nNevertheless it was a proud day for him when he found himself seated\nwith Fra Colonna at the table of his present employer, Cardinal\nBessarion. They were about a mile from the top of that table; but never\nmind, there they were and Gerard had the advantage of seeing roast\npheasants dished up with all their feathers as if they had just flown\nout of a coppice instead of off the spit: also chickens cooked in\nbottles, and tender as peaches. But the grand novelty was the napkins,\nsurpassingly fine, and folded into cocked hats, and birds' wings, and\nfans, etc., instead of lying flat. This electrified Gerard; though my\nreaders have seen the dazzling phenomenon without tumbling backwards\nchair and all.\n\nAfter dinner the tables were split in pieces, and carried away, and lo,\nunder each was another table spread with sweetmeats. The signoras and\nsignorinas fell upon them and gormandized; but the signors eyed them\nwith reasonable suspicion.\n\n\"But, dear father,\" objected Gerard, \"I see not the bifurcal daggers,\nwith which men say his excellency armeth the left hand of a man.\"\n\n\"Nay, 'tis the Cardinal Orsini which hath invented yon peevish\ninstrument for his guests to fumble their meat withal. One, being in\nhaste, did skewer his tongue to his palate with it, I hear; O tempora,\nO mores! The ancients, reclining godlike at their feasts, how had they\nspurned such pedantries.\"\n\nAs soon as the ladies had disported themselves among the sugar-plums,\nthe tables were suddenly removed, and the guests sat in a row against\nthe wall. Then came in, ducking and scraping, two ecclesiastics with\nlutes, and kneeled at the cardinal's feet and there sang the service\nof the day; then retired with a deep obeisance: In answer to which\nthe cardinal fingered his skull cap as our late Iron Duke his hat: the\ncompany dispersed, and Gerard had dined with a cardinal and one that had\nthrice just missed being pope.\n\nBut greater honour was in store.\n\nOne day the cardinal sent for him, and after praising the beauty of his\nwork took him in his coach to the Vatican; and up a private stair to a\nluxurious little room, with a great oriel window. Here were inkstands,\nsloping frames for writing on, and all the instruments of art. The\ncardinal whispered a courtier, and presently the Pope's private\nsecretary appeared with a glorious grimy old MS. of Plutarch's Lives.\nAnd soon Gerard was seated alone copying it, awe-struck, yet half\ndelighted at the thought that his holiness would handle his work and\nread it.\n\nThe papal inkstands were all glorious externally; but within the ink\nwas vile. But Gerard carried ever good ink, home-made, in a dirty little\ninkhorn: he prayed on his knees for a firm and skilful hand, and set to\nwork.\n\nOne side of his room was nearly occupied by a massive curtain divided\nin the centre; but its ample folds overlapped. After a while Gerard\nfelt drawn to peep through that curtain. He resisted the impulse. It\nreturned. It overpowered him. He left Plutarch; stole across the matted\nfloor; took the folds of the curtain, and gently gathered them up with\nhis fingers, and putting his nose through the chink ran it against a\ncold steel halbert. Two soldiers, armed cap-a-pie, were holding their\nglittering weapons crossed in a triangle. Gerard drew swiftly back; but\nin that instant he heard the soft murmur of voices, and saw a group of\npersons cringing before some hidden figure.\n\nHe never repeated his attempt to pry through the guarded curtain; but\noften eyed it. Every hour or so an ecclesiastic peeped in, eyed him,\nchilled him, and exit. All this was gloomy, and mechanical. But the next\nday a gentleman, richly armed, bounced in, and glared at him. \"What is\ntoward here?\" said he.\n\nGerard told him he was writing out Plutarch, with the help of the\nsaints. The spark said he did not know the signor in question. Gerard\nexplained the circumstances of time and space that had deprived the\nSignor Plutarch of the advantage of the spark's conversation.\n\n\"Oh! one of those old dead Greeks they keep such a coil about.\"\n\n\"Ay, signor, one of them, who, being dead, yet live.\"\n\n\"I understand you not, young man,\" said the noble, with all the dignity\nof ignorance. \"What did the old fellow write? Love stories?\" and his\neyes sparkled: \"merry tales, like Boccaccio.\"\n\n\"Nay, lives of heroes and sages.\"\n\n\"Soldiers and popes?\"\n\n\"Soldiers and princes.\"\n\n\"Wilt read me of them some day?\"\n\n\"And willingly, signor. But what would they say who employ me, were I to\nbreak off work?\"\n\n\"Oh, never heed that; know you not who I am? I am Jacques Bonaventura,\nnephew to his holiness the Pope, and captain of his guards. And I came\nhere to look after my fellows. I trow they have turned them out of\ntheir room for you.\" Signor Bonaventura then hurried away. This lively\ncompanion, however, having acquired a habit of running into that little\nroom, and finding Gerard good company, often looked in on him, and\nchattered ephemeralities while Gerard wrote the immortal lives.\n\nOne day he came a changed and moody man, and threw himself into chair,\ncrying, \"Ah, traitress! traitress!\" Gerard inquired what was his ill?\n\"Traitress! traitress!\" was the reply. Whereupon Gerard wrote Plutarch.\nThen says Bonaventura, \"I am melancholy; and for our Lady's sake read\nme a story out of Ser Plutarcho, to soothe my bile: in all that Greek is\nthere nought about lovers betrayed?\"\n\nGerard read him the life of Alexander. He got excited, marched about the\nroom, and embracing the reader, vowed to shun \"soft delights,\" that bed\nof nettles, and follow glory.\n\nWho so happy now as Gerard? His art was honoured, and fabulous prices\npaid for it; in a year or two he should return by sea to Holland, with\ngood store of money, and set up with his beloved Margaret in Bruges, or\nAntwerp, or dear Augsburg, and end their days in peace, and love, and\nhealthy, happy labour. His heart never strayed an instant from her.\n\nIn his prosperity he did not forget poor Pietro. He took the Fra Colonna\nto see his picture. The friar inspected it severely and closely, fell on\nthe artist's neck, and carried the picture to one of the Colonnas, who\ngave a noble price for it.\n\nPietro descended to the first floor; and lived like a gentleman.\n\nBut Gerard remained in his garret. To increase his expenses would have\nbeen to postpone his return to Margaret. Luxury had no charms for the\nsingle-hearted one, when opposed to love.\n\nJacques Bonaventura made him acquainted with other gay young fellows.\nThey loved him, and sought to entice him into vice, and other expenses.\nBut he begged humbly to be excused. So he escaped that temptation. But a\ngreater was behind.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LX\n\nFRA COLONNA had the run of the Pope's library, and sometimes left\noff work at the same hour and walked the city with Gerard, on which\noccasions the happy artist saw all things en beau, and was wrapped up in\nthe grandeur of Rome and its churches, palaces, and ruins.\n\nThe friar granted the ruins, but threw cold water on the rest.\n\n\"This place Rome? It is but the tomb of mighty Rome.\" He showed Gerard\nthat twenty or thirty feet of the old triumphal arches were underground,\nand that the modern streets ran over ancient palaces, and over the tops\nof columns; and coupling this with the comparatively narrow limits of\nthe modern city, and the gigantic vestiges of antiquity that peeped\naboveground here and there, he uttered a somewhat remarkable simile. \"I\ntell thee this village they call Rome is but as one of those swallows'\nnests ye shall see built on the eaves of a decayed abbey.\"\n\n\"Old Rome must indeed have been fair then,\" said Gerard.\n\n\"Judge for yourself, my son; you see the great sewer, the work of the\nRomans in their very childhood, and shall outlast Vesuvius. You see the\nfragments of the Temple of Peace. How would you look could you see also\nthe Capitol with its five-and-twenty temples? Do but note this Monte\nSavello; what is it, an it pleases you, but the ruins of the ancient\ntheatre of Marcellus? and as for Testacio, one of the highest hills in\nmodern Rome, it is but an ancient dust heap; the women of old Rome flung\ntheir broken pots and pans there, and lo--a mountain.\n\n\"'Ex pede Herculem; ex ungue leonem.'\"\n\nGerard listened respectfully, but when the holy friar proceeded by\nanalogy to imply that the moral superiority of the heathen Romans was\nproportionally grand, he resisted stoutly. \"Has then the world lost\nby Christ His coming?\" said he; but blushed, for he felt himself\nreproaching his benefactor.\n\n\"Saints forbid!\" said the friar. \"'Twere heresy to say so.\" And having\nmade this direct concession, he proceeded gradually to evade it by\nsubtle circumlocution, and reached the forbidden door by the spiral back\nstaircase. In the midst of all which they came to a church with a knot\nof persons in the porch. A demon was being exorcised within. Now Fra\nColonna had a way of uttering a curious sort of little moan, when things\nZeno or Epicurus would not have swallowed were presented to him as\nfacts. This moan conveyed to such as had often heard it not only strong\ndissent, but pity for human credulity, ignorance, and error, especially\nof course when it blinded men to the merits of Pagandom.\n\nThe friar moaned, and said, \"Then come away.\n\n\"Nay, father, prithee! prithee! I ne'er saw a divell cast out.\"\n\nThe friar accompanied Gerard into the church, but had a good shrug\nfirst. There they found the demoniac forced down on his knees before the\naltar with a scarf tied round his neck, by which the officiating priest\nheld him like a dog in a chain.\n\nNot many persons were present, for fame had put forth that the last\ndemon cast out in that church went no farther than into one of the\ncompany: \"as a cony ferreted out of one burrow runs to the next.\"\n\nWhen Gerard and the friar came up, the priest seemed to think there were\nnow spectators enough; and began.\n\nHe faced the demoniac, breviary in hand, and first set himself to learn\nthe individual's name with whom he had to deal.\n\n\"Come out, Ashtaroth. Oho! it is not you then. Come out, Belial. Come\nout, Tatzi. Come out, Eza. No; he trembles not. Come out, Azymoth. Come\nout, Feriander. Come out, Foletho. Come out, Astyma. Come out, Nebul.\nAha! what, have I found ye? 'tis thou, thou reptile; at thine old\ntricks. Let us pray!\n\n\"Oh, Lord, we pray thee to drive the foul fiend Nebul out of this thy\ncreature: out of his hair, and his eyes, out of his nose, out of his\nmouth, out of his ears, out of his gums, out of his teeth, out of his\nshoulders, out of his arms, legs, loins, stomach, bowels, thighs, knees,\ncalves, feet, ankles, finger-nails, toe-nails, and soul. Amen.\"\n\nThe priest then rose from his knees, and turning to the company, said,\nwith quiet geniality, \"Gentles, we have here as obstinate a divell as\nyou may see in a summer day.\" Then, facing the patient, he spoke to\nhim with great rigour, sometimes addressing 'the man and sometimes the\nfiend, and they answered him in turn through the same mouth, now saying\nthat they hated those holy names the priest kept uttering, and now\ncomplaining they did feel so bad in their inside.\n\nIt was the priest who first confounded the victim and the culprit in\nidea, by pitching into the former, cuffing him soundly, kicking him, and\nspitting repeatedly in his face. Then he took a candle and lighted it,\nand turned it down, and burned it till it burned his fingers; when he\ndropped it double quick. Then took the custodial; and showed the patient\nthe Corpus Domini within. Then burned another candle as before, but more\ncautiously: then spoke civilly to the demoniac in his human character,\ndismissed him, and received the compliments of the company.\n\n\"Good father,\" said Gerard, \"how you have their names by heart. Our\nnorthern priests have no such exquisite knowledge of the hellish\nsquadrons.\"\n\n\"Ay, young man, here we know all their names, and eke their ways, the\nreptiles. This Nebul is a bitter hard one to hunt out.\"\n\nHe then told the company in the most affable way several of his\nexperiences; concluding with his feat of yesterday, when he drove a\ngreat hulking fiend out of a woman by her mouth, leaving behind him\ncertain nails, and pins, and a tuft of his own hair, and cried out in a\nvoice of anguish, \"'Tis not thou that conquers me. See that stone on\nthe window sill. Know that the angel Gabriel coming down to earth once\nlighted on that stone: 'tis that has done my business.\"\n\nThe friar moaned. \"And you believed him?\"\n\n\"Certes! who but an infidel has discredited a revelation so precise.\"\n\n\"What, believe the father of lies? That is pushing credulity beyond the\nage.\"\n\n\"Oh, a liar does not always lie.\"\n\n\"Ay doth he whenever he tells an improbable story to begin, and shows\nyou a holy relic; arms you against the Satanic host. Fiends (if any) be\nnot so simple. Shouldst have answered him out of antiquity--\n\n'Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes.'\n\nSome blackguard chopped his wife's head off on that stone, young man;\nyou take my word for it.\" And the friar hurried Gerard away.\n\n\"Alack, father, I fear you abashed the good priest.\"\n\n\"Ay, by Pollux,\" said the friar, with a chuckle; \"I blistered him with\na single touch of 'Socratic interrogation.' What modern can parry the\nweapons of antiquity.\"\n\nOne afternoon, when Gerard had finished his day's work, a fine lackey\ncame and demanded his attendance at the Palace Cesarini. He went, and\nwas ushered into a noble apartment; there was a girl seated in it,\nworking on a tapestry. She rose and left the room, and said she would\nlet her mistress know.\n\nA good hour did Gerard cool his heels in that great room, and at last\nhe began to fret. \"These nobles think nothing of a poor fellow's time.\"\nHowever, just as he was making up his mind to slip out, and go about\nhis business, the door opened, and a superb beauty entered the room,\nfollowed by two maids. It was the young princess of the house of\nCesarini. She came in talking rather loudly and haughtily to her\ndependents, but at sight of Gerard lowered her voice to a very feminine\ntone, and said, \"Are you the writer, messer?\"\n\n\"I am, Signora.\n\n\"'Tis well.\"\n\nShe then seated herself; Gerard and her maids remained standing.\n\n\"What is your name, good youth?\"\n\n\"Gerard, signora.\"\n\n\"Gerard? body of Bacchus! is that the name of a human creature?\"\n\n\"It is a Dutch name, signora. I was born at Tergou, in Holland.\"\n\n\"A harsh name, girls, for so well-favoured a youth; what say you?\"\n\nThe maids assented warmly.\n\n\"What did I send for him for?\" inquired the lady, with lofty languor.\n\"Ah, I remember. Be seated, Ser Gerardo, and write me a letter to Ercole\nOrsini, my lover; at least he says so.\"\n\nGerard seated himself, took out paper and ink, and looked up to the\nprincess for instructions.\n\nShe, seated on a much higher chair, almost a throne, looked down at him\nwith eyes equally inquiring.\n\n\"Well, Gerardo.\"\n\n\"I am ready, your excellence.\"\n\n\"Write, then.\"\n\n\"I but await the words.\"\n\n\"And who, think you, is to provide them?\"\n\n\"Who but your grace, whose letter it is to be?\"\n\n\"Gramercy! what, you writers, find you not the words? What avails your\nart without the words? I doubt you are an impostor, Gerardo.\"\n\n\"Nay, Signora, I am none. I might make shift to put your highness's\nspeech into grammar, as well as writing. But I cannot interpret your\nsilence. Therefore speak what is in your heart, and I will empaper it\nbefore your eyes.\"\n\n\"But there is nothing in my heart. And sometimes I think I have got no\nheart.\"\n\n\"What is in your mind, then?\"\n\n\"But there is nothing in my mind; nor my head neither.\"\n\n\"Then why write at all?\"\n\n\"Why, indeed? That is the first word of sense either you or I have\nspoken, Gerardo. Pestilence seize him! why writeth he not first? then I\ncould say nay to this, and ay to that, withouten headache. Also is it a\nlady's part to say the first word?\"\n\n\"No, signora: the last.\"\n\n\"It is well spoken, Gerardo. Ha! ha! Shalt have a gold piece for thy\nwit. Give me my purse!\" And she paid him for the article on the nail a\nla moyen age. Money never yet chilled zeal. Gerard, after getting a gold\npiece so cheap, felt bound to pull her out of her difficulty, if the wit\nof man might achieve it. \"Signorina,\" said he, \"these things are only\nhard because folk attempt too much, are artificial and labour phrases.\nDo but figure to yourself the signor you love--\"\n\n\"I love him not.\"\n\n\"Well, then, the signor you love not-seated at this table, and dict to\nme just what you would say to him.\"\n\n\"Well, if he sat there, I should say, 'Go away.'\"\n\nGerard, who was flourishing his pen by way of preparation, laid it down\nwith a groan.\n\n\"And when he was gone,\" said Floretta, \"your highness would say, 'Come\nback.'\"\n\n\"Like enough, wench. Now silence, all, and let me think. He pestered me\nto write, and I promised; so mine honour is engaged. What lie shall I\ntell the Gerardo to tell the fool?\" and she turned her head away from\nthem and fell into deep thought, with her noble chin resting on her\nwhite hand, half clenched.\n\nShe was so lovely and statuesque, and looked so inspired with thoughts\ncelestial, as she sat thus, impregnating herself with mendacity, that\nGerard forgot all, except art, and proceeded eagerly to transfer that\nexquisite profile to paper.\n\nHe had very nearly finished when the fair statue turned brusquely round\nand looked at him.\n\n\"Nay, Signora,\" said he, a little peevishly; \"for Heaven's sake change\nnot your posture--'twas perfect. See, you are nearly finished.\"\n\nAll eyes were instantly on the work, and all tongues active.\n\n\"How like! and done in a minute: nay, methinks her highness's chin is\nnot quite so.\"\n\n\"Oh, a touch will make that right.\"\n\n\"What a pity 'tis not coloured. I'm all for colours. Hang black and\nwhite! And her highness hath such a lovely skin. Take away her skin, and\nhalf her beauty is lost.\"\n\n\"Peace. Can you colour, Ser Gerardo?\"\n\n\"Ay, signorina. I am a poor hand at oils; there shines my friend Pietro;\nbut in this small way I can tint you to the life, if you have time to\nwaste on such vanity.\"\n\n\"Call you this vanity? And for time, it hangs on me like lead. Send for\nyour colours now--quick, this moment--for love of all the saints.\"\n\n\"Nay, signorina, I must prepare them. I could come at the same time.\"\n\n\"So be it. And you, Floretta, see that he be admitted at all hours.\nAlack! Leave my head! leave my head!\"\n\n\"Forgive me, Signora; I thought to prepare it at home to receive the\ncolours. But I will leave it. And now let us despatch the letter.\"\n\n\"What letter?\"\n\n\"To the Signor Orsini.\"\n\n\"And shall I waste my time on such vanity as writing letters--and to\nthat empty creature, to whom I am as indifferent as the moon? Nay, not\nindifferent, for I have just discovered my real sentiments. I hate him\nand despise him. Girls, I here forbid you once for all to mention that\nsignor's name to me again; else I'll whip you till the blood comes. You\nknow how I can lay on when I'm roused.\"\n\n\"We do. We do.\"\n\n\"Then provoke me not to it;\" and her eye flashed daggers, and she turned\nto Gerard all instantaneous honey. \"Addio, il Gerardo.\" And Gerard bowed\nhimself out of this velvet tiger's den.\n\nHe came next day and coloured her; and next he was set to make a\nportrait of her on a large scale; and then a full-length figure; and\nhe was obliged to set apart two hours in the afternoon, for drawing and\npainting this princess, whose beauty and vanity were prodigious, and\ncandidates for a portrait of her numerous. Here the thriving Gerard\nfound a new and fruitful source of income.\n\nMargaret seemed nearer and nearer.\n\n\nIt was Holy Thursday. No work this day. Fra Colonna and Gerard sat in a\nwindow and saw the religious processions. Their number and pious ardour\nthrilled Gerard with the devotion that now seemed to animate the whole\npeople, lately bent on earthly joys.\n\nPresently the Pope came pacing majestically at the head of his\ncardinals, in a red hat, white cloak, a capuchin of red velvet, and\nriding a lovely white Neapolitan barb, caparisoned with red velvet\nfringed and tasselled with gold; a hundred horsemen, armed cap-a-pie,\nrode behind him with their lances erected, the butt-end resting on the\nman's thigh. The cardinals went uncovered, all but one, de Medicis, who\nrode close to the Pope and conversed with him as with an equal. At every\nfifteen steps the Pope stopped a single moment, and gave the people his\nblessing, then on again.\n\nGerard and the friar now came down, and threading some by-streets\nreached the portico of one of the seven churches. It was hung with\nblack, and soon the Pope and cardinals, who had entered the church\nby another door, issued forth, and stood with torches on the steps,\nseparated by barriers from the people; then a canon read a Latin Bull,\nexcommunicating several persons by name, especially such princes as were\nkeeping the Church out of any of her temporal possessions.\n\nAt this awful ceremony Gerard trembled, and so did the people. But two\nof the cardinals spoiled the effect by laughing unreservedly the whole\ntime.\n\nWhen this was ended, the black cloth was removed, and revealed a gay\npanoply; and the Pope blessed the people, and ended by throwing his\ntorch among them: so did two cardinals. Instantly there was a scramble\nfor the torches: they were fought for, and torn in pieces by the\ncandidates, so devoutly that small fragments were gained at the price\nof black eyes, bloody noses, and burnt fingers; In which hurtling his\nholiness and suite withdrew in peace.\n\nAnd now there was a cry, and the crowd rushed to a square where was a\nlarge, open stage: several priests were upon it praying. They rose, and\nwith great ceremony donned red gloves. Then one of their number kneeled,\nand with signs of the lowest reverence drew forth from a shrine a square\nframe, like that of a mirror, and inside was as it were the impression\nof a face.\n\nIt was the Verum icon, or true impression of our Saviour's face, taken\nat the very moment of His most mortal agony for us. Received as it was\nwithout a grain of doubt, imagine how it moved every Christian heart.\n\nThe people threw themselves on their faces when the priest raised it on\nhigh; and cries of pity were in every mouth, and tears in almost every\neye. After a while the people rose, and then the priest went round the\nplatform, showing it for a single moment to the nearest; and at each\nsight loud cries of pity and devotion burst forth.\n\nSoon after this the friends fell in with a procession of Flagellants,\nflogging their bare shoulders till the blood ran streaming down; but\nwithout a sign of pain in their faces, and many of them laughing and\njesting as they lashed. The bystanders out of pity offered them wine;\nthey took it, but few drank it; they generally used it to free the tails\nof the cat, which were hard with clotted blood, and make the next stroke\nmore effective. Most of them were boys, and a young woman took pity on\none fair urchin. \"Alas! dear child,\" said she, \"why wound thy white skin\nso?\" \"Basta,\" said he, laughing, \"'tis for your sins I do it, not for\nmine.\"\n\n\"Hear you that?\" said the friar. \"Show me the whip that can whip\nthe vanity out of man's heart! The young monkey; how knoweth he that\nstranger is a sinner more than he?\"\n\n\"Father,\" said Gerard, \"surely this is not to our Lord's mind. He was so\npitiful.\"\n\n\"Our Lord?\" said the friar, crossing himself. \"What has He to do with\nthis? This was a custom in Rome six hundred years before He was born.\nThe boys used to go through the streets, at the Lupercalia flogging\nthemselves. And the married women used to shove in, and try and get a\nblow from the monkeys' scourges; for these blows conferred fruitfulness\nin those days. A foolish trick this flagellation; but interesting to\nthe bystander; reminds him of the grand old heathen. We are so prone to\nforget all we owe them.\"\n\nNext they got into one of the seven churches, and saw the Pope give the\nmass. The ceremony was imposing, but again--spoiled by the inconsistent\nconduct of the cardinals and other prelates, who sat about the altar\nwith their hats on, chattering all through the mass like a flock of\ngeese.\n\nThe eucharist in both kinds was tasted by an official before the Pope\nwould venture on it; and this surprised Gerard beyond measure. \"Who is\nthat base man? and what doth he there?\"\n\n\"Oh, that is 'the Preguste,' and he tastes the eucharist by way of\nprecaution. This is the country for poison; and none fall oftener by it\nthan the poor Popes.\"\n\n\"Alas! so I have heard; but after the miraculous change of the bread\nand wine to Christ His body and blood, poison cannot remain; gone is the\nbread with all its properties and accidents; gone is the wine.\"\n\n\"So says Faith; but experience tells another tale. Scores have died in\nItaly poisoned in the host.\"\n\n\"And I tell you, father, that were both bread and wine charged with\ndirest poison before his holiness had consecrated them, yet after\nconsecration I would take them both withouten fear.\"\n\n\"So would I, but for the fine arts.\"\n\n\"What mean you?\"\n\n\"Marry, that I would be as ready to leave the world as thou, were it not\nfor those arts, which beautify existence here below, and make it dear to\nmen of sense and education. No; so long as the Nine Muses strew my path\nwith roses of learning and art, me may Apollo inspire with wisdom and\ncaution, that knowing the wiles of my countrymen, I may eat poison\nneither at God's altar nor at a friend's table, since, wherever I eat\nit or drink it, it will assuredly cut short my mortal thread; and I am\nwriting a book--heart and soul in it--'The Dream of Polifilo,' the\nman of many arts. So name not poison to me till that is finished and\ncopied.\"\n\nAnd now the great bells of St. John Lateran's were rung with a clash at\nshort intervals, and the people hurried thither to see the heads of St.\nPeter and St. Paul.\n\nGerard and the friar got a good place in the church, and there was a\ngreat curtain, and after long and breathless expectation of the people,\nthis curtain was drawn by jerks, and at a height of about thirty feet\nwere two human heads with bearded faces, that seemed alive. They were\nshown no longer than the time to say an Ave Maria, and then the curtain\ndrawn. But they were shown in this fashion three times. St. Peter's\ncomplexion was pale, his face oval, his beard grey and forked; his head\ncrowned with a papal mitre. St. Paul was dark skinned, with a thick,\nsquare beard; his face also and head were more square and massive, and\nfull of resolution.\n\nGerard was awe-struck. The friar approved after his fashion.\n\n\"This exhibition of the 'imagines,' or waxen effigies of heroes and\ndemigods, is a venerable custom, and inciteth the vulgar to virtue by\ngreat and invisible examples.\n\n\"Waxen images? What, are they not the apostles themselves, embalmed, or\nthe like?\"\n\nThe friar moaned.\n\n\"They did not exist in the year 800. The great old Roman families always\nproduced at their funerals a series of these 'imagines,' thereby tying\npast and present history together, and showing the populace the\nfeatures of far-famed worthies. I can conceive nothing more thrilling or\ninstructive. But then the effigies were portraits made during life or\nat the hour of death. These of St. Paul and St. Peter are moulded out of\npure fancy.\"\n\n\"Ah! say not so, father.\"\n\n\"But the worst is, this humour of showing them up on a shelf, and half\nin the dark, and by snatches, and with the poor mountebank trick of a\ndrawn curtain.\n\n'Quodcunque ostendis mihi sic incredulus odi.'\n\nEnough; the men of this day are not the men of old. Let us have done\nwith these new-fangled mummeries, and go among the Pope's books; there\nwe shall find the wisdom we shall vainly hunt in the streets of modern\nRome.\"\n\nAnd this idea having once taken root, the good friar plunged and tore\nthrough the crowd, and looked neither to the right hand nor to the left,\ntill he had escaped the glories of the holy week, which had brought\nfifty thousand strangers to Rome; and had got nice and quiet among the\ndead in the library of the Vatican.\n\nPresently, going into Gerard's room, he found a hot dispute afoot\nbetween him and Jacques Bonaventura. That spark had come in, all steel\nfrom head to toe; doffed helmet, puffed, and railed most scornfully on a\nridiculous ceremony, at which he and his soldiers had been compelled to\nattend the Pope; to wit the blessing of the beasts of burden.\n\nGerard said it was not ridiculous; nothing a Pope did could be\nridiculous.\n\nThe argument grew warm, and the friar stood grimly neuter, waiting like\nthe stork that ate the frog and the mouse at the close of their combat,\nto grind them both between the jaws of antiquity; when lo, the curtain\nwas gently drawn, and there stood a venerable old man in a purple skull\ncap, with a beard like white floss silk, looking at them with a kind\nthough feeble smile.\n\n\"Happy youth,\" said he, \"that can heat itself over such matters.\"\n\nThey all fell on their knees. It was the Pope.\n\n\"Nay, rise, my children,\" said he, almost peevishly. \"I came not into\nthis corner to be in state. How goes Plutarch?\"\n\nGerard brought his work, and kneeling on one knee presented it to his\nholiness, who had seated himself, the others standing.\n\nHis holiness inspected it with interest.\n\n\"'Tis excellently writ,\" said he.\n\nGerard's heart beat with delight.\n\n\"Ah! this Plutarch, he had a wondrous art, Francesco. How each character\nstandeth out alive on his page: how full of nature each, yet how unlike\nhis fellow!\"\n\nJacques Bonaventura. \"Give me the Signor Boccaccio.\"\n\nHis Holiness. \"An excellent narrator, capitano, and writeth exquisite\nItalian. But in spirit a thought too monotonous. Monks and nuns were\nnever all unchaste: one or two such stories were right pleasant and\ndiverting; but five score paint his time falsely, and sadden the heart\nof such as love mankind. Moreover, he hath no skill at characters. Now\nthis Greek is supreme in that great art: he carveth them with pen; and\nturning his page, see into how real and great a world we enter of war,\nand policy, and business, and love in its own place: for with him, as in\nthe great world, men are not all running after a wench. With this great\nopen field compare me not the narrow garden of Boccaccio, and his little\nmill-round of dishonest pleasures.\"\n\n\"Your holiness, they say, hath not disdained to write a novel.\"\n\n\"My holiness hath done more foolish things than one, whereof it repents\ntoo late. When I wrote novels I little thought to be head of the\nChurch.\"\n\n\"I search in vain for a copy of it to add to my poor library.\"\n\n\"It is well. Then the strict orders I gave four years ago to destroy\nevery copy in Italy have been well discharged. However, for your\ncomfort, on my being made Pope, some fool turned it into French: so that\nyou may read it, at the price of exile.\"\n\n\"Reduced to this strait we throw ourselves on your holiness's\ngenerosity. Vouchsafe to give us your infallible judgment on it!\"\n\n\"Gently, gently, good Francesco. A Pope's novels are not matters of\nfaith. I can but give you my sincere impression. Well then the work\nin question had, as far as I can remember, all the vices of Boccaccio,\nwithout his choice Italian.\"\n\nFra Colonna. \"Your holiness is known for slighting Aeneas Silvius as\nother men never slighted him. I did him injustice to make you his\njudge. Perhaps your holiness will decide more justly between these two\nboys-about blessing the beasts.\"\n\nThe Pope demurred. In speaking of Plutarch he had brightened up for\na moment, and his eye had even flashed; but his general manner was as\nunlike what youthful females expect in a Pope as you can conceive. I can\nonly describe it in French. Le gentilhomme blase. A highbred, and\nhighly cultivated gentleman, who had done, and said, and seen, and\nknown everything, and whose body was nearly worn out. But double languor\nseemed to seize him at the father's proposal.\n\n\"My poor Francesco,\" said he, \"bethink thee that I have had a life of\ncontroversy, and am sick on't; sick as death. Plutarch drew me to this\ncalm retreat; not divinity.\"\n\n\"Nay, but, your holiness, for moderating of strife between two hot young\nbloods, {Makarioi oi eirinopioi}.\"\n\n\"And know you nature so ill, as to think either of these high-mettled\nyouths will reck what a poor old Pope saith?\"\n\n\"Oh! your holiness,\" broke in Gerard, blushing and gasping, \"sure, here\nis one who will treasure your words all his life as words from Heaven.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said the Pope, \"I am fairly caught. As Francesco here\nwould say--\n\n{ouk estin ostis est' anyr eleutheos}.\n\nI came to taste that eloquent heathen, dear to me e'en as to thee, thou\npaynim monk; and I must talk divinity, or something next door to it.\nBut the youth hath a good and a winning face, and writeth Greek like an\nangel. Well then, my children, to comprehend the ways of the Church, we\nshould still rise a little above the earth, since the Church is between\nheaven and earth, and interprets betwixt them.\n\n\"The question is then, not how vulgar men feel, but how the common\nCreator of man and beast doth feel, towards the lower animals. This, if\nwe are too proud to search for it in the lessons of the Church, the next\nbest thing is to go to the most ancient history of men and animals.\"\n\nColonna. \"Herodotus.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay; in this matter Herodotus is but a mushroom. Finely were we\nsped for ancient history, if we depended on your Greeks, who did but\nwrite on the last leaf of that great book, Antiquity.\"\n\nThe friar groaned. Here was a Pope uttering heresy against his demigods.\n\n\"'Tis the Vulgate I speak of. A history that handles matters three\nthousand years before him pedants call 'the Father of History.'\"\n\nColonna. \"Oh! the Vulgate? I cry your holiness mercy. How you frightened\nme. I quite forgot the Vulgate.\"\n\n\"Forgot it? art sure thou ever readst it, Francesco mio?\"\n\n\"Not quite, your holiness. 'Tis a pleasure I have long promised myself,\nthe first vacant moment. Hitherto these grand old heathen have left me\nsmall time for recreation.\"\n\nHis Holiness. \"First then you will find in Genesis that God, having\ncreated the animals, drew a holy pleasure, undefinable by us, from\ncontemplating of their beauty. Was it wonderful? See their myriad forms;\ntheir lovely hair and eyes, their grace, and of some the power and\nmajesty: the colour of others, brighter than roses, or rubies. And when,\nfor man's sin, not their own, they were destroyed, yet were two of each\nkind spared.\n\n\"And when the ark and its trembling inmates tumbled solitary on the\nworld of water, then, saith the word, 'God remembered Noah, and the\ncattle that were with him in the ark.'\n\n\"Thereafter God did write His rainbow in the sky as a bond that earth\nshould be flooded no more; and between whom the bond? between God and\nman? nay, between God and man, and every living creature of all flesh:\nor my memory fails me with age. In Exodus God commanded that the cattle\nshould share the sweet blessing of the one day's rest. Moreover He\n'forbade to muzzle the ox that trod out the corn. 'Nay, let the poor\noverwrought soul snatch a mouthful as he goes his toilsome round: the\nbulk of the grain shall still be for man.' Ye will object perchance\nthat St. Paul, commenting this, saith rudely, 'Doth God care for oxen?'\nVerily, had I been Peter, instead of the humblest of his successors,\nI had answered him. 'Drop thy theatrical poets, Paul, and read the\nScriptures: then shalt thou know whether God careth only for men and\nsparrows, or for all his creatures. O, Paul,' had I made bold to say,\n'think not to learn God by looking into Paul's heart, nor any heart of\nman, but study that which he hath revealed concerning himself.'\n\n\"Thrice he forbade the Jews to boil the kid in his mother's milk; not\nthat this is cruelty, but want of thought and gentle sentiments, and so\npaves the way for downright cruelty. A prophet riding on an ass did\nmeet an angel. Which of these two, Paulo judice, had seen the heavenly\nspirit? marry, the prophet. But it was not so. The man, his vision\ncloyed with sin, saw nought. The poor despised creature saw all. Nor is\nthis recorded as miraculous. Poor proud things, we overrate ourselves.\nThe angel had slain the prophet and spared the ass, but for that\ncreature's clearer vision of essences divine. He said so, methinks.\nBut in sooth I read it many years agone. Why did God spare repentant\nNineveh? Because in that city were sixty thousand children, besides much\ncattle.\n\n\"Profane history and vulgar experience add their mite of witness. The\ncruel to animals end in cruelty to man; and strange and violent deaths,\nmarked with retribution's bloody finger, have in all ages fallen from\nheaven on such as wantonly harm innocent beasts. This I myself have\nseen. All this duly weighed, and seeing that, despite this Francesco's\nfriends, the Stoics, who in their vanity say the creatures all subsist\nfor man's comfort, there be snakes and scorpions which kill 'Dominum\nterra' with a nip, musquitoes which eat him piecemeal, and tigers and\nsharks which crack him like an almond, we do well to be grateful to\nthese true, faithful, patient, four-footed friends, which, in lieu of\npowdering us, put forth their strength to relieve our toils, and do feed\nus like mothers from their gentle dugs.\n\n\"Methinks then the Church is never more divine than in this benediction\nof our four-footed friends, which has revolted you great theological\nauthority, the captain of the Pope's guards; since here she inculcates\nhumility and gratitude, and rises towards the level of the mind divine,\nand interprets God to man, God the Creator, parent, and friend of man\nand beast.\n\n\"But all this, young gentles, you will please to receive, not as\ndelivered by the Pope ex cathedra, but uttered carelessly, in a free\nhour, by an aged clergyman. On that score you will perhaps do well to\nentertain it with some little consideration. For old age must surely\nbring a man somewhat, in return for his digestion (his 'dura puerorum\nilia,' eh, Francesco!), which it carries away.\"\n\nSuch was the purport of the Pope's discourse but the manner high bred,\nlanguid, kindly, and free from all tone of dictation. He seemed to be\ngently probing the matter in concert with his hearers, not playing\nSir Oracle. At the bottom of all which was doubtless a slight touch of\nhumbug, but the humbug that embellishes life; and all sense of it was\nlost in the subtle Italian grace of the thing.\n\n\"I seem to hear the oracle of Delphi,\" said Fra Colonna\nenthusiastically.\n\n\"I call that good sense,\" shouted Jacques Bonaventura.\n\n\"Oh, captain, good sense!\" said Gerard, with a deep and tender reproach.\n\nThe Pope smiled on Gerard. \"Cavil not at words; that was an unheard\nof concession from a rival theologian.\" He then asked for all Gerard's\nwork, and took it away in his hand. But before going, he gently pulled\nFra Colonna's ear, and asked him whether he remembered when they were\nschool-fellows together and robbed the Virgin by the roadside of the\nmoney dropped into her box. \"You took a flat stick and applied bird-lime\nto the top, and drew the money out through the chink, you rogue,\" said\nhis holiness severely.\n\n\"To every signor his own honour,\" replied Fra Colonna. \"It was your\nholiness's good wit invented the manoeuvre. I was but the humble\ninstrument.\"\n\n\"It is well. Doubtless you know 'twas sacrilege.\"\n\n\"Of the first water; but I did it in such good company, it troubles me\nnot.\"\n\n\"Humph! I have not even that poor consolation. What did we spend it in,\ndost mind?\"\n\n\"Can your holiness ask? why, sugar-plums.\"\n\n\"What, all on't?\"\n\n\"Every doit.\"\n\n\"These are delightful reminiscences, my Francesco. Alas! I am getting\nold. I shall not be here long. And I am sorry for it, for thy sake. They\nwill go and burn thee when I am gone. Art far more a heretic than Huss,\nwhom I saw burned with these eyes; and oh, he died like a martyr.\"\n\n\"Ay, your holiness; but I believe in the Pope; and Huss did not.\"\n\n\"Fox! They will not burn thee; wood is too dear. Adieu, old playmate;\nadieu, young gentlemen; an old man's blessing be on you.\"\n\nThat afternoon the Pope's secretary brought Gerard a little bag: in it\nwere several gold pieces.\n\nHe added them to his store.\n\nMargaret seemed nearer and nearer.\n\nFor some time past, too, it appeared as if the fairies had watched over\nhim. Baskets of choice provisions and fruits were brought to his door by\nporters, who knew not who had employed them, or affected ignorance; and\none day came a jewel in a letter, but no words.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXI\n\nThe Princess Claelia ordered a full-length portrait of herself. Gerard\nadvised her to employ his friend Pietro Vanucci.\n\nBut she declined. \"'Twill be time to put a slight on the Gerardo, when\nhis work discontents me.\" Then Gerard, who knew he was an excellent\ndraughtsman, but not so good a colourist, begged her to stand to him\nas a Roman statue. He showed her how closely he could mimic marble\non paper. She consented at first; but demurred when this enthusiast\nexplained to her that she must wear the tunic, toga, and sandals of the\nancients.\n\n\"Why, I had as lieve be presented in my smock,\" said she, with mediaeval\nfrankness.\n\n\"Alack! signorina,\" said Gerard, \"you have surely never noted the\nancient habit; so free, so ample, so simple, yet so noble; and most\nbecoming your highness, to whom Heaven hath given the Roman features,\nand eke a shapely arm and hand, his in modern guise.\"\n\n\"What, can you flatter, like the rest, Gerardo? Well, give me time to\nthink on't. Come o' Saturday, and then I will say ay or nay.\"\n\nThe respite thus gained was passed in making the tunic and toga, etc.,\nand trying them on in her chamber, to see whether they suited her style\nof beauty well enough to compensate their being a thousand years out of\ndate.\n\nGerard, hurrying along to this interview, was suddenly arrested, and\nrooted to earth at a shop window.\n\nHis quick eye had discerned in that window a copy of Lactantius lying\nopen. \"That is fairly writ, anyway,\" thought he.\n\nHe eyed it a moment more with all his eyes.\n\nIt was not written at all. It was printed.\n\nGerard groaned.\n\n\"I am sped; mine enemy is at the door. The press is in Rome.\"\n\nHe went into the shop, and affecting nonchalance, inquired how long the\nprinting-press had been in Rome. The man said he believed there was no\nsuch thing in the city. \"Oh, the Lactantius; that was printed on the top\nof the Apennines.\"\n\n\"What, did the printing-press fall down there out o' the moon?\"\n\n\"Nay, messer,\" said the trader, laughing; \"it shot up there out of\nGermany. See the title-page!\"\n\nGerard took the Lactantius eagerly, and saw the following--\n\n     Opera et impensis Sweynheim et Pannartz\n     Alumnorum Joannis Fust.\n     Impressum Subiacis. A.D. 1465.\n\n\"Will ye buy, messer? See how fair and even be the letters. Few are left\ncan write like that; and scarce a quarter of the price.\"\n\n\"I would fain have it,\" said Gerard sadly, \"but my heart will not let\nme. Know that I am a caligraph, and these disciples of Fust run after me\nround the world a-taking the bread out of my mouth. But I wish them no\nill. Heaven forbid!\" And he hurried from the shop.\n\n\"Dear Margaret,\" said he to himself, \"we must lose no time; we must\nmake our hay while shines the sun. One month more and an avalanche of\nprinter's type shall roll down on Rome from those Apennines, and lay us\nwaste that writers be.\"\n\nAnd he almost ran to the Princess Claelia.\n\nHe was ushered into an apartment new to him. It was not very large,\nbut most luxurious; a fountain played in the centre, and the floor was\ncovered with the skins of panthers, dressed with the hair, so that no\nfootfall could be heard. The room was an ante-chamber to the princess's\nboudoir, for on one side there was no door, but an ample curtain of\ngorgeous tapestry.\n\nHere Gerard was left alone till he became quite uneasy, and doubted\nwhether the maid had not shown him to the wrong place.\n\nThese doubts were agreeably dissipated.\n\nA light step came swiftly behind the curtain; it parted in the middle,\nand there stood a figure the heathens might have worshipped. It was not\nquite Venus, nor quite Minerva; but between the two; nobler than Venus,\nmore womanly than Jupiter's daughter. Toga, tunic, sandals; nothing was\nmodern. And as for beauty, that is of all times.\n\nGerard started up, and all the artist in him flushed with pleasure.\n\n\"Oh!\" he cried innocently, and gazed in rapture.\n\nThis added the last charm to his model: a light blush tinted her cheeks,\nand her eyes brightened, and her mouth smiled with delicious complacency\nat this genuine tribute to her charms.\n\nWhen they had looked at one another so some time, and she saw Gerard's\neloquence was confined to ejaculating and gazing, she spoke. \"Well,\nGerardo, thou seest I have made myself an antique monster for thee.\"\n\n\"A monster? I doubt Fra Colonna would fall down and adore your highness,\nseeing you so habited.\"\n\n\"Nay, I care not to be adored by an old man. I would liever be loved by\na young one: of my own choosing.\"\n\nGerard took out his pencils, arranged his canvas, which he had covered\nwith stout paper, and set to work; and so absorbed was he that he had\nno mercy on his model. At last, after near an hour in one posture,\n\"Gerardo,\" said she faintly, \"I can stand so no more, even for thee.\"\n\n\"Sit down and rest awhile, Signora.\"\n\n\"I thank thee,\" said she; and sinking into a chair turned pale and\nsighed.\n\nGerard was alarmed, and saw also he had been inconsiderate. He took\nwater from the fountain and was about to throw it in her face; but she\nput up a white hand deprecatingly: \"Nay, hold it to my brow with thine\nhand: prithee, do not fling it at me!\"\n\nGerard timidly and hesitating applied his wet hand to her brow.\n\n\"Ah!\" she sighed, \"that is reviving. Again.\"\n\nHe applied it again. She thanked him, and asked him to ring a little\nhand-bell on the table. He did so, and a maid came, and was sent to\nFloretta with orders to bring a large fan.\n\nFloretta speedily came with the fan.\n\nShe no sooner came near the princess, than that lady's highbred nostrils\nsuddenly expanded like a bloodhorse's. \"Wretch!\" said she; and rising\nup with a sudden return to vigour, seized Floretta with her left hand,\ntwisted it in her hair, and with the right hand boxed her ears severely\nthree times.\n\nFloretta screamed and blubbered; but obtained no mercy.\n\nThe antique toga left quite disengaged a bare arm, that now seemed as\npowerful as it was beautiful: it rose and fell like the piston of a\nmodern steam-engine, and heavy slaps resounded one after another on\nFloretta's shoulders; the last one drove her sobbing and screaming\nthrough the curtain, and there she was heard crying bitterly for some\ntime after.\n\n\"Saints of heaven!\" cried Gerard, \"what is amiss? what has she done?\"\n\n\"She knows right well. 'Tis not the first time. The nasty toad! I'll\nlearn her to come to me stinking of the musk-cat.\"\n\n\"Alas! Signora, 'twas a small fault, methinks.\"\n\n\"A small fault? Nay, 'twas a foul fault.\" She added with an amazing\nsudden descent to humility and sweetness, \"Are you wroth with me for\nbeating her, Gerar-do?\"\n\n\"Signora, it ill becomes me to school you; but methinks such as Heaven\nappoints to govern others should govern themselves.\"\n\n\"That is true, Gerardo. How wise you are, to be so young.\" She then\ncalled the other maid, and gave her a little purse. \"Take that to\nFloretta, and tell her 'the Gerardo' hath interceded for her; and so I\nmust needs forgive her. There, Gerardo.\"\n\nGerard coloured all over at the compliment; but not knowing how to\nturn a phrase equal to the occasion, asked her if he should resume her\npicture.\n\n\"Not yet; beating that hussy hath somewhat breathed me. I'll sit awhile,\nand you shall talk to me. I know you can talk, an it pleases you, as\nrarely as you draw.\"\n\n\"That were easily done.\n\n\"Do it then, Gerardo.\"\n\nGerard was taken aback.\n\n\"But, signora, I know not what to say. This is sudden.\"\n\n\"Say your real mind. Say you wish you were anywhere but here.\"\n\n\"Nay, signora, that would not be sooth. I wish one thing though.\"\n\n\"Ay, and what is that?\" said she gently.\n\n\"I wish I could have drawn you as you were beating that poor lass. You\nwere awful, yet lovely. Oh, what a subject for a Pythoness!\"\n\n\"Alas! he thinks but of his art. And why keep such a coil about my\nbeauty, Gerardo? You are far fairer than I am. You are more like Apollo\nthan I to Venus. Also, you have lovely hair and lovely eyes--but you\nknow not what to do with them.\"\n\n\"Ay, do I. To draw you, signora.\"\n\n\"Ah, yes; you can see my features with them; but you cannot see what any\nRoman gallant had seen long ago in your place. Yet sure you must have\nnoted how welcome you are to me, Gerardo?\"\n\n\"I can see your highness is always passing kind to me; a poor stranger\nlike me.\"\n\n\"No, I am not, Gerardo. I have often been cold to you; rude sometimes;\nand you are so simple you see not the cause. Alas! I feared for my own\nheart. I feared to be your slave. I who have hitherto made slaves. Ah!\nGerardo, I am unhappy. Ever since you came here I have lived upon\nyour visits. The day you are to come I am bright. The other days I am\nlistless, and wish them fled. You are not like the Roman gallants. You\nmake me hate them. You are ten times braver to my eye; and you are\nwise and scholarly, and never flatter and lie. I scorn a man that lies.\nGerar-do, teach me thy magic; teach me to make thee as happy by my side\nas I am still by thine.\"\n\nAs she poured out these strange words, the princess's mellow voice sunk\nalmost to a whisper, and trembled with half-suppressed passion, and her\nwhite hand stole timidly yet earnestly down Gerard's arm, till it rested\nlike a soft bird upon his wrist, and as ready to fly away at a word.\n\nDestitute of vanity and experience, wrapped up in his Margaret and his\nart, Gerard had not seen this revelation coming, though it had come by\nregular and visible gradations.\n\nHe blushed all over. His innocent admiration of the regal beauty that\nbesieged him, did not for a moment displace the absent Margaret's image.\nYet it was regal beauty, and wooing with a grace and tenderness he had\nnever even figured in imagination. How to check her without wounding\nher?\n\nHe blushed and trembled.\n\nThe siren saw, and encouraged him.\n\n\"Poor Gerardo,\" she murmured, \"fear not; none shall ever harm thee under\nmy wing. Wilt not speak to me, Gerar-do mio?\"\n\n\"Signora!\" muttered Gerard deprecatingly.\n\nAt this moment his eye, lowered in his confusion, fell on the shapely\nwhite arm and delicate hand that curled round his elbow like a tender\nvine, and it flashed across him how he had just seen that lovely limb\nemployed on Floretta.\n\nHe trembled and blushed.\n\n\"Alas!\" said the princess, \"I scare him. Am I then so very terrible? Is\nit my Roman robe? I'll doff it, and habit me as when thou first camest\nto me. Mindest thou? 'Twas to write a letter to yon barren knight Ercole\nd'Orsini. Shall I tell thee? 'twas the sight of thee, and thy pretty\nways, and thy wise words, made me hate him on the instant. I liked the\nfool well enough before; or wist I liked him. Tell me now how many times\nhast thou been here since then. Ah! thou knowest not; lovest me not, I\ndoubt, as I love thee. Eighteen times, Gerardo. And each time dearer\nto me. The day thou comest not 'tis night, not day, to Claelia. Alas!\nI speak for both. Cruel boy, am I not worth a word? Hast every day a\nprincess at thy feet? Nay, prithee, prithee, speak to me, Gerar-do.\"\n\n\"Signora,\" faltered Gerard, \"what can I say, that were not better left\nunsaid? Oh, evil day that ever I came here.\"\n\n\"Ah! say not so. 'Twas the brightest day ever shone on me or indeed on\nthee. I'll make thee confess so much ere long, ungrateful one.\"\n\n\"Your highness,\" began Gerard, in a low, pleading voice.\n\n\"Call me Claelia, Gerar-do.\"\n\n\"Signora, I am too young and too little wise to know how I ought to\nspeak to you, so as not to seem blind nor yet ungrateful. But this I\nknow, I were both naught and ungrateful, and the worst foe e'er you had,\ndid I take advantage of this mad fancy. Sure some ill spirit hath had\nleave to afflict you withal. For 'tis all unnatural that a princess\nadorned with every grace should abase her affections on a churl.\"\n\nThe princess withdrew her hand slowly from Gerard's wrist.\n\nYet as it passed lightly over his arm it seemed to linger a moment at\nparting.\n\n\"You fear the daggers of my kinsmen,\" said she, half sadly, half\ncontemptuously.\n\n\"No more than I fear the bodkins of your women,\" said Gerard haughtily.\n\"But I fear God and the saints, and my own conscience.\"\n\n\"The truth, Gerardo, the truth! Hypocrisy sits awkwardly on thee.\nPrincesses, while they are young, are not despised for love of God, but\nof some other woman. Tell me whom thou lovest; and if she is worthy thee\nI will forgive thee.\"\n\n\"No she in Italy, upon my soul.\"\n\n\"Ah! there is one somewhere then. Where? where?\"\n\n\"In Holland, my native country.\"\n\n\"Ah! Marie de Bourgoyne is fair, they say. Yet she is but a child.\"\n\n\"Princess, she I love is not noble. She is as I am. Nor is she so\nfair as thou. Yet is she fair; and linked to my heart for ever by her\nvirtues, and by all the dangers and griefs we have borne together, and\nfor one another. Forgive me; but I would not wrong my Margaret for all\nthe highest dames in Italy.\"\n\nThe slighted beauty started to her feet, and stood opposite him, as\nbeautiful, but far more terrible than when she slapped Floretta, for\nthen her cheeks were red, but now they were pale, and her eyes full of\nconcentrated fury.\n\n\"This to my face, unmannered wretch,\" she cried. \"Was I born to be\ninsulted, as well as scorned, by such as thou? Beware! We nobles brook\nno rivals. Bethink thee whether is better, the love of a Cesarini, or\nher hate: for after all I have said and done to thee, it must be love or\nhate between us, and to the death. Choose now!\"\n\nHe looked up at her with wonder and awe, as she stood towering over him\nin her Roman toga, offering this strange alternative.\n\nHe seemed to have affronted a goddess of antiquity; he a poor puny\nmortal.\n\nHe sighed deeply, but spoke not.\n\nPerhaps something in his deep and patient sigh touched a tender chord in\nthat ungoverned creature; or perhaps the time had come for one passion\nto ebb and another to flow. The princess sank languidly into a seat, and\nthe tears began to steal rapidly down her cheeks.\n\n\"Alas! alas!\" said Gerard. \"Weep not, sweet lady; your tears they\ndo accuse me, and I am like to weep for company. My kind patron, be\nyourself; you will live to see how much better a friend I was to you\nthan I seemed.\"\n\n\"I see it now, Gerardo,\" said the princess. \"Friend is the word! the\nonly word can ever pass between us twain. I was mad. Any other man had\nta'en advantage of my folly. You must teach me to be your friend and\nnothing more.\"\n\nGerard hailed this proposition with joy; and told her out of Cicero how\ngodlike a thing was friendship, and how much better and rarer and more\nlasting than love: to prove to her he was capable of it, he even told\nher about Denys and himself.\n\nShe listened with her eyes half shut, watching his words to fathom his\ncharacter, and learn his weak point.\n\nAt last, she addressed him calmly thus: \"Leave me now, Gerardo, and come\nas usual to-morrow. You will find your lesson well bestowed.\"\n\nShe held out her hand to him: he kissed it; and went away pondering\ndeeply this strange interview, and wondering whether he had done\nprudently or not.\n\nThe next day he was received with marked distance, and the princess\nstood before him literally like a statue, and after a very short\nsitting, excused herself and dismissed him. Gerard felt the chilling\ndifference; but said to himself, \"She is wise.\" So she was in her way.\n\nThe next day he found the princess waiting for him surrounded by young\nnobles flattering her to the skies. She and they treated him like a\ndog that could do one little trick they could not. The cavaliers in\nparticular criticised his work with a mass of ignorance and insolence\ncombined that made his cheeks burn.\n\nThe princess watched his face demurely with half-closed eyes at each\nsting the insects gave him; and when they had fled, had her doors closed\nagainst every one of them for their pains.\n\nThe next day Gerard found her alone: cold and silent. After standing to\nhim so some time, she said, \"You treated my company with less respect\nthan became you.\"\n\n\"Did I, Signora?\"\n\n\"Did you? you fired up at the comments they did you the honour to make\non your work.\"\n\n\"Nay, I said nought,\" observed Gerard.\n\n\"Oh, high looks speak as plain as high words. Your cheeks were red as\nblood.\"\n\n\"I was nettled a moment at seeing so much ignorance and ill-nature\ntogether.\"\n\n\"Now it is me, their hostess, you affront.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, Signora, and acquit me of design. It would ill become me to\naffront the kindest patron and friend I have in Rome but one.\"\n\n\"How humble we are all of a sudden. In sooth, Ser Gerardo, you are a\ncapital feigner. You can insult or truckle at will.\"\n\n\"Truckle? to whom?\"\n\n\"To me, for one; to one, whom you affronted for a base-born girl like\nyourself; but whose patronage you claim all the same.\"\n\nGerard rose, and put his hand to his heart. \"These are biting words,\nsignora. Have I really deserved them?\"\n\n\"Oh, what are words to an adventurer like you? cold steel is all you\nfear?\"\n\n\"I am no swashbuckler, yet I have met steel with steel and methinks I\nhad rather face your kinsmen's swords than your cruel tongue, lady. Why\ndo you use me so?\"\n\n\"Gerar-do, for no good reason, but because I am wayward, and shrewish,\nand curst, and because everybody admires me but you.\"\n\n\"I admire you too, Signora. Your friends may flatter you more; but\nbelieve me they have not the eye to see half your charms. Their babble\nyesterday showed me that. None admire you more truly, or wish you\nbetter, than the poor artist, who might not be your lover, but hoped\nto be your friend; but no, I see that may not be between one so high as\nyou, and one so low as I.\"\n\n\"Ay! but it shall, Gerardo,\" said the princess eagerly. \"I will not be\nso curst. Tell me now where abides thy Margaret; and I will give thee a\npresent for her; and on that you and I will be friends.\"\n\n\"She is a daughter of a physician called Peter, and they bide at\nSevenbergen; ah me, shall I e'er see it again?\"\n\n\"'Tis well. Now go.\" And she dismissed him somewhat abruptly.\n\nPoor Gerard. He began to wade in deep waters when he encountered this\nItalian princess; callida et calida selis filia. He resolved to go no\nmore when once he had finished her likeness. Indeed he now regretted\nhaving undertaken so long and laborious a task.\n\nThis resolution was shaken for a moment by his next reception, which was\nall gentleness and kindness.\n\nAfter standing to him some time in her toga, she said she was fatigued,\nand wanted his assistance in another way: would he teach her to draw a\nlittle? He sat down beside her, and taught her to make easy lines. He\nfound her wonderfully apt. He said so.\n\n\"I had a teacher before thee, Gerar-do. Ay, and one as handsome as\nthyself.\" She then went to a drawer, and brought out several heads\ndrawn with a complete ignorance of the art, but with great patience and\nnatural talent. They were all heads of Gerard, and full of spirit; and\nreally not unlike. One was his very image. \"There,\" said she. \"Now thou\nseest who was my teacher.\"\n\n\"Not I, signora.\"\n\n\"What, know you not who teaches us women to do all things? 'Tis love,\nGerar-do. Love made me draw because thou draweth, Gerar-do. Love prints\nthine image in my bosom. My fingers touch the pen, and love supplies the\nwant of art, and lo thy beloved features lie upon the paper.\"\n\nGerard opened his eyes with astonishment at this return to an\ninterdicted topic. \"Oh, Signora, you promised me to be friends and\nnothing more.\"\n\nShe laughed in his face. \"How simple you are: who believes a woman\npromising nonsense, impossibilities? Friendship, foolish boy, who\never built that temple on red ashes? Nay Gerardo,\" she added gloomily,\n\"between thee and me it must be love or hate.\"\n\n\"Which you will, signora,\" said Gerard firmly. \"But for me I will\nneither love nor hate you; but with your permission I will leave you.\"\nAnd he rose abruptly.\n\nShe rose too, pale as death, and said, \"Ere thou leavest me so, know thy\nfate; outside that door are armed men who wait to slay thee at a word\nfrom me.\"\n\n\"But you will not speak that word, signora.\"\n\n\"That word I will speak. Nay, more, I shall noise it abroad it was for\nproffering brutal love to me thou wert slain; and I will send a special\nmessenger to Sevenbergen: a cunning messenger, well taught his lesson.\nThy Margaret shall know thee dead, and think thee faithless; now, go to\nthy grave; a dog's. For a man thou art not.\"\n\nGerard turned pale, and stood dumb-stricken. \"God have mercy on us\nboth.\"\n\n\"Nay, have thou mercy on her, and on thyself. She will never know in\nHolland what thou dost in Rome; unless I be driven to tell her my tale.\nCome, yield thee, Gerar-do mio: what will it cost thee to say thou\nlovest me? I ask thee but to feign it handsomely. Thou art young: die\nnot for the poor pleasure of denying a lady what-the shadow of a heart.\nWho will shed a tear for thee? I tell thee men will laugh, not weep\nover thy tombstone-ah!\" She ended in a little scream, for Gerard threw\nhimself in a moment at her feet, and poured out in one torrent of\neloquence the story of his love and Margaret's. How he had been\nimprisoned, hunted with bloodhounds for her, driven to exile for her;\nhow she had shed her blood for him, and now pined at home. How he\nhad walked through Europe environed by perils, torn by savage brutes,\nattacked by furious men with sword and axe and trap, robbed, shipwrecked\nfor her.\n\nThe princess trembled, and tried to get away from him; but he held\nher robe, he clung to her, he made her hear his pitiful story and\nMargaret's; he caught her hand, and clasped it between both his, and his\ntears fell fast on her hand, as he implored her to think on all the\nwoes of the true lovers she would part; and what but remorse, swift\nand lasting, could come of so deep a love betrayed, and so false a love\nfeigned, with mutual hatred lurking at the bottom.\n\nIn such moments none ever resisted Gerard.\n\nThe princess, after in vain trying to get away from him, for she felt\nhis power over her, began to waver, and sigh, and her bosom to rise and\nfall tumultuously, and her fiery eyes to fill.\n\n\"You conquer me,\" she sobbed. \"You, or my better angel. Leave Rome!\"\n\n\"I will, I will.\"\n\n\"If you breathe a word of my folly, it will be your last.\"\n\n\"Think not so poorly of me. You are my benefactress once more. Is it for\nme to slander you?\"\n\n\"Go! I will send you the means. I know myself; if you cross my path\nagain, I shall kill you. Addio; my heart is broken.\"\n\nShe touched her bell. \"Floretta,\" said she, in a choked voice, \"take him\nsafe out of the house, through my chamber, and by the side postern.\"\n\nHe turned at the door; she was leaning with one hand on a chair, crying,\nwith averted head. Then he thought only of her kindness, and ran back\nand kissed her robe. She never moved.\n\nOnce clear of the house he darted home, thanking Heaven for his escape,\nsoul and body.\n\n\"Landlady,\" said he, \"there is one would pick a quarrel with me. What is\nto be done?\"\n\n\"Strike him first, and at vantage! Get behind him; and then draw.\"\n\n\"Alas, I lack your Italian courage. To be serious, 'tis a noble.\"\n\n\"Oh, holy saints, that is another matter. Change thy lodging awhile, and\nkeep snug; and alter the fashion of thy habits.\"\n\nShe then took him to her own niece, who let lodgings at some little\ndistance, and installed him there.\n\nHe had little to do now, and no princess to draw, so he set himself\nresolutely to read that deed of Floris Brandt, from which he had\nhitherto been driven by the abominably bad writing. He mastered it, and\nsaw at once that the loan on this land must have been paid over and over\nagain by the rents, and that Ghysbrecht was keeping Peter Brandt out of\nhis own.\n\n\"Fool! not to have read this before,\" he cried. He hired a horse and\nrode down to the nearest port. A vessel was to sail for Amsterdam in\nfour days.\n\nHe took a passage; and paid a small sum to secure it.\n\n\"The land is too full of cut-throats for me,\" said he; \"and 'tis lovely\nfair weather for the sea. Our Dutch skippers are not shipwrecked like\nthese bungling Italians.\"\n\nWhen he returned home there sat his old landlady with her eyes\nsparkling.\n\n\"You are in luck, my young master,\" said she. \"All the fish run to your\nnet this day methinks. See what a lackey hath brought to our house! This\nbill and this bag.\"\n\nGerard broke the seals, and found it full of silver crowns. The letter\ncontained a mere slip of paper with this line, cut out of some MS.:--\"La\nlingua non ha osso, ma fa rompere il dosso.\"\n\n\"Fear me not!\" said Gerard aloud. \"I'll keep mine between my teeth.\"\n\n\"What is that?\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing. Am I not happy, dame? I am going back to my sweetheart\nwith money in one pocket, and land in the other.\" And he fell to dancing\nround her.\n\n\"Well,\" said she, \"I trow nothing could make you happier.\"\n\n\"Nothing, except to be there.\"\n\n\"Well, that is a pity, for I thought to make you a little happier with a\nletter from Holland.\"\n\n\"A letter? for me? where? how? who brought it?--Oh, dame!\"\n\n\"A stranger; a painter, with a reddish face and an outlandish name;\nAnselmin, I trow.\"\n\n\"Hans Memling! a friend of mine. God bless him!\"\n\n\"Ay, that is it: Anselmin. He could scarce speak a word, but a had the\nwit to name thee; and a puts the letter down, and a nods and smiles, and\nI nods and smiles, and gives him a pint o' wine, and it went down him\nlike a spoonful.\"\n\n\"That is Hans, honest Hans. Oh, dame, I am in luck to-day; but I\ndeserve it. For, I care not if I tell you, I have just overcome a great\ntemptation for dear Margaret's sake.\"\n\n\"Who is she?\"\n\n\"Nay, I'd have my tongue cut out sooner than betray her, but oh, it was\na temptation. Gratitude pushing me wrong, Beauty almost divine pulling\nme wrong: curses, reproaches, and hardest of all to resist, gentle tears\nfrom eyes used to command. Sure some saint helped me Anthony belike. But\nmy reward is come.\"\n\n\"Ay, is it, lad; and no farther off than my pocket. Come out, Gerard's\nreward,\" and she brought a letter out of her capacious pocket.\n\nGerard threw his arm round her neck and hugged her.\n\n\"My best friend,\" said he, \"my second mother, I'll read it to you.\n\n\"Ay, do, do.\"\n\n\"Alas! it is not from Margaret. This is not her hand.\" And he turned it\nabout.\n\n\"Alack; but maybe her bill is within. The lasses are aye for gliding in\ntheir bills under cover of another hand.\"\n\n\"True. Whose hand is this? sure I have seen it. I trow 'tis my dear\nfriend the demoiselle Van Eyck. Oh, then Margaret's bill will be\ninside.\" He tore it open. \"Nay, 'tis all in one writing. 'Gerard, my\nwell beloved son' (she never called me that before that I mind), 'this\nletter brings thee heavy news from one would liever send thee joyful\ntidings. Know that Margaret Brandt died in these arms on Thursday\nsennight last.' (What does the doting old woman mean by that?) 'The last\nword on her lips was \"Gerard:\" she said, \"Tell him I prayed for him at\nmy last hour; and bid him pray for me.\" She died very comfortable, and\nI saw her laid in the earth, for her father was useless, as you shall\nknow. So no more at present from her that is with sorrowing heart thy\nloving friend and servant,\n\n\"MARGARET VAN EYCK.'\"\n\n\"Ay, that is her signature sure enough. Now what d'ye think of that,\ndame?\" cried Gerard, with a grating laugh. \"There is a pretty letter to\nsend to a poor fellow so far from home. But it is Reicht Heynes I blame\nfor humouring the old woman and letting her do it; as for the old woman\nherself, she dotes, she has lost her head, she is fourscore. Oh, my\nheart, I'm choking. For all that she ought to be locked up, or her hands\ntied. Say this had come to a fool; say I was idiot enough to believe\nthis; know ye what I should do? run to the top of the highest church\ntower in Rome and fling myself off it, cursing Heaven. Woman! woman!\nwhat are you doing?\" And he seized her rudely by the shoulder. \"What are\nye weeping for?\" he cried, in a voice all unlike his own, and loud and\nhoarse as a raven. \"Would ye scald me to death with your tears? She\nbelieves it. She believes it. Ah! ah! ah! ah! ah! ah!--Then there is no\nGod.\"\n\nThe poor woman sighed and rocked herself.\n\n\"And must be the one to bring it thee all smiling and smirking? I could\nkill myself for't. Death spares none,\" she sobbed. \"Death spares none.\"\n\nGerard staggered against the window sill. \"But He is master of death,\"\nhe groaned. \"Or they have taught me a lie. I begin to fear there is no\nGod, and the saints are but dead bones, and hell is master of the world.\nMy pretty Margaret; my sweet, my loving Margaret. The best daughter! the\ntruest lover! the pride of Holland! the darling of the world! It is a\nlie. Where is this caitiff Hans? I'll hunt him round the town. I'll cram\nhis murdering falsehood down his throat.\"\n\nAnd he seized his hat and ran furiously about the streets for hours.\n\nTowards sunset he came back white as a ghost. He had not found Memling;\nbut his poor mind had had time to realise the woman's simple words, that\nDeath spares none.\n\nHe crept into the house bent, and feeble as an old man, and refused\nall food. Nor would he speak, but sat, white, with great staring eyes,\nmuttering at intervals, \"There is no God.\" Alarmed both on his account\nand on her own (for he looked a desperate maniac), his landlady ran for\nher aunt.\n\nThe good dame came, and the two women, braver together, sat one on each\nside of him, and tried to soothe him with kind and consoling voices.\nBut he heeded them no more than the chairs they sat on. Then the younger\nheld a crucifix out before him, to aid her. \"Maria, mother of heaven,\ncomfort him,\" they sighed. But he sat glaring, deaf to all external\nsounds.\n\nPresently, without any warning, he jumped up, struck the crucifix rudely\nout of his way with a curse, and made a headlong dash at the door. The\npoor women shrieked. But ere he reached the door, something seemed to\nthem to draw him up straight by his hair, and twirl him round like a\ntop. He whirled twice round with arms extended; then fell like a dead\nlog upon the floor, with blood trickling from his nostrils and ears.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\nGerard returned to consciousness and to despair.\n\nOn the second day he was raving with fever on the brain.\n\nOn a table hard by lay his rich auburn hair, long as a woman's.\n\nThe deadlier symptoms succeeded one another rapidly.\n\nOn the fifth day his leech retired and gave him up.\n\nOn the sunset of that same day he fell into a deep sleep.\n\nSome said he would wake only to die.\n\nBut an old gossip, whose opinion carried weight (she had been a\nprofessional nurse), declared that his youth might save him yet, could\nhe sleep twelve hours.\n\nOn this his old landlady cleared the room and watched him alone. She\nvowed a wax candle to the Virgin for every hour he should sleep.\n\nHe slept twelve hours.\n\nThe good soul rejoiced, and thanked the Virgin on her knees.\n\nHe slept twenty-four hours.\n\nHis kind nurse began to doubt. At the thirtieth hour she sent for the\nwoman of art.\n\n\"Thirty hours! shall we wake him?\"\n\nThe other inspected him closely for some time.\n\n\"His breath is even, his hand moist. I know there be learned leeches\nwould wake him, to look at his tongue, and be none the wiser; but we\nthat be women should have the sense to let bon Nature alone. When did\nsleep ever harm the racked brain or the torn heart?\"\n\nWhen he had been forty-eight hours asleep, it got wind, and they had\nmuch ado to keep the curious out. But they admitted only Fra Colonna and\nhis friend the gigantic Fra Jerome.\n\nThese two relieved the women, and sat silent; the former eyeing his\nyoung friend with tears in his eyes, the latter with beads in his\nhand looked as calmly on him as he had on the sea when Gerard and he\nencountered it hand to hand.\n\nAt last, I think it was about the sixtieth hour of this strange sleep,\nthe landlady touched Fra Colonna with her elbow. He looked. Gerard had\nopened his eyes as gently as if he had been but dozing.\n\nHe stared.\n\nHe drew himself up a little in bed.\n\nHe put his hand to his head, and found his hair was gone.\n\nHe noticed his friend Colonna, and smiled with pleasure.\n\nBut in the middle of smiling his face stopped, and was convulsed in a\nmoment with anguish unspeakable, and he uttered a loud cry, and turned\nhis face to the wall.\n\nHis good landlady wept at this. She had known what it is to awake\nbereaved.\n\nFra Jerome recited canticles, and prayers from his breviary.\n\nGerard rolled himself in the bed-clothes.\n\nFra Colonna went to him, and whimpering, reminded him that all was not\nlost. The divine Muses were immortal. He must transfer his affection to\nthem; they would never betray him nor fail him like creatures of clay.\nThe good, simple father then hurried away; for he was overcome by his\nemotion.\n\nFra Jerome remained behind. \"Young man,\" said he, \"the Muses exist but\nin the brains of pagans and visionaries. The Church alone gives repose\nto the heart on earth, and happiness to the soul hereafter. Hath earth\ndeceived thee, hath passion broken thy heart after tearing it, the\nChurch opens her arms: consecrate thy gifts to her! The Church is peace\nof mind.\"\n\nHe spoke these words solemnly at the door, and was gone as soon as they\nwere uttered.\n\n\"The Church!\" cried Gerard, rising furiously, and shaking his fist after\nthe friar. \"Malediction on the Church! But for the Church I should\nnot lie broken here, and she lie cold, cold, cold, in Holland. Oh, my\nMargaret! oh, my darling! my darling! And I must run from thee the few\nmonths thou hadst to live. Cruel! cruel! The monsters, they let her die.\nDeath comes not without some signs. These the blind selfish wretches saw\nnot, or recked not; but I had seen them, I that love her. Oh, had I been\nthere, I had saved her, I had saved her. Idiot! idiot! to leave her for\na moment.\"\n\nHe wept bitterly a long time.\n\nThen, suddenly bursting into rage again, he cried vehemently \"The\nChurch! for whose sake I was driven from her; my malison be on the\nChurch! and the hypocrites that name it to my broken heart. Accursed be\nthe world! Ghysbrecht lives; Margaret dies. Thieves, murderers, harlots,\nlive for ever. Only angels die. Curse life! curse death! and whosoever\nmade them what they are!\"\n\nThe friar did not hear these mad and wicked words; but only the yell of\nrage with which they were flung after him.\n\nIt was as well. For, if he had heard them, he would have had his late\nshipmate burned in the forum with as little hesitation as he would have\nroasted a kid.\n\nHis old landlady who had accompanied Fra Colonna down the stair, heard\nthe raised voice, and returned in some anxiety.\n\nShe found Gerard putting on his clothes, and crying.\n\nShe remonstrated.\n\n\"What avails my lying here?\" said he gloomily. \"Can I find here that\nwhich I seek?\"\n\n\"Saints preserve us! Is he distraught again? What seek ye?\"\n\n\"Oblivion.\"\n\n\"Oblivion, my little heart? Oh, but y'are young to talk so.\"\n\n\"Young or old, what else have I to live for?\"\n\nHe put on his best clothes.\n\nThe good dame remonstrated. \"My pretty Gerard, know that it is Tuesday,\nnot Sunday.\"\n\n\"Oh, Tuesday is it? I thought it had been Saturday.\"\n\n\"Nay, thou hast slept long. Thou never wearest thy brave clothes on\nworking days. Consider.\"\n\n\"What I did, when she lived, I did. Now I shall do whatever erst I did\nnot. The past is the past. There lies my hair, and with it my way of\nlife. I have served one Master as well as I could. You see my reward.\nNow I'll serve another, and give him a fair trial too.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" sighed the woman, turning pale, \"what mean these dark words? and\nwhat new master is this whose service thou wouldst try?\"\n\n\"SATAN.\"\n\nAnd with this horrible declaration on his lips the miserable creature\nwalked out with his cap and feather set jauntily on one side, and feeble\nlimbs, and a sinister face pale as ashes, and all drawn down as if by\nage.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIII\n\nA dark cloud fell on a noble mind.\n\nHis pure and unrivalled love for Margaret had been his polar star. It\nwas quenched, and he drifted on the gloomy sea of no hope.\n\nNor was he a prey to despair alone, but to exasperation at all his\nself-denial, fortitude, perils, virtue, wasted and worse than wasted;\nfor it kept burning and stinging him, that, had he stayed lazily,\nselfishly at home, he should have saved his Margaret's life.\n\nThese two poisons, raging together in his young blood, maddened and\ndemoralized him. He rushed fiercely into pleasure. And in those days,\neven more than now, pleasure was vice. Wine, women, gambling, whatever\ncould procure him an hour's excitement and a moment's oblivion. He\nplunged into these things, as men tired of life have rushed among the\nenemy's bullets.\n\nThe large sums he had put by for Margaret gave him ample means for\ndebauchery, and he was soon the leader of those loose companions he had\nhitherto kept at a distance.\n\nHis heart deteriorated along with his morals.\n\nHe sulked with his old landlady for thrusting gentle advice and warning\non him; and finally removed to another part of the town, to be clear of\nremonstrance and reminiscences. When he had carried this game on some\ntime, his hand became less steady, and he could no longer write to\nsatisfy himself. Moreover, his patience declined as the habits of\npleasure grew on him. So he gave up that art, and took likenesses in\ncolours.\n\nBut this he neglected whenever the idle rakes, his companions, came for\nhim.\n\nAnd so he dived in foul waters, seeking that sorry oyster-shell,\nOblivion.\n\nIt is not my business to paint at full length the scenes of coarse vice\nin which this unhappy young man now played a part. But it is my business\nto impress the broad truth, that he was a rake, a debauchee, and a\ndrunkard, and one of the wildest, loosest, and wickedest young men in\nRome.\n\nThey are no lovers of truth, nor of mankind, who conceal or slur the\nwickedness of the good, and so by their want of candour rob despondent\nsinners of hope.\n\nEnough, the man was not born to do things by halves. And he was not\nvicious by halves.\n\nHis humble female friends often gossiped about him. His old landlady\ntold Teresa he was going to the bad, and prayed her to try and find out\nwhere he was.\n\nTeresa told her husband Lodovico his sad story, and bade him look about\nand see if he could discover the young man's present abode. \"Shouldst\nremember his face, Lodovico mio?\"\n\n\"Teresa, a man in my way of life never forgets a face, least of all a\nbenefactor's. But thou knowest I seldom go abroad by daylight.\"\n\nTeresa sighed. \"And how long is it to be so, Lodovico?\"\n\n\"Till some cavalier passes his sword through me. They will not let a\npoor fellow like me take to any honest trade.\"\n\nPietro Vanucci was one of those who bear prosperity worse than\nadversity.\n\nHaving been ignominiously ejected for late hours by their old landlady,\nand meeting Gerard in the street, he greeted him warmly, and soon after\ntook up his quarters in the same house.\n\nHe brought with him a lad called Andrea, who ground his colours, and\nwas his pupil, and also his model, being a youth of rare beauty, and as\nsharp as a needle.\n\nPietro had not quite forgotten old times, and professed a warm\nfriendship for Gerard.\n\nGerard, in whom all warmth of sentiment seemed extinct, submitted coldly\nto the other's friendship.\n\nAnd a fine acquaintance it was. This Pietro was not only a libertine,\nbut half a misanthrope, and an open infidel.\n\nAnd so they ran in couples, with mighty little in common. O, rare\nphenomenon!\n\nOne day, when Gerard had undermined his health, and taken the bloom\noff his beauty, and run through most of his money, Vanucci got up a\ngay party to mount the Tiber in a boat drawn by buffaloes. Lorenzo de'\nMedici had imported these creatures into Florence about three years\nbefore. But they were new in Rome, and nothing would content this beggar\non horseback, Vanucci, but being drawn by the brutes up the Tiber.\n\nEach libertine was to bring a lady and she must be handsome, or he\nbe fined. But the one that should contribute the loveliest was to be\ncrowned with laurel, and voted a public benefactor. Such was their\nreading of \"Vir bonus est quis?\" They got a splendid galley, and twelve\nbuffaloes. And all the libertines and their female accomplices assembled\nby degrees at the place of embarkation. But no Gerard.\n\nThey waited for him some time, at first patiently, then impatiently.\n\nVanucci excused him. \"I heard him say he had forgotten to provide\nhimself with a fardingale. Comrades, the good lad is hunting for\na beauty fit to take rank among these peerless dames. Consider the\ndifficulty, ladies, and be patient!\"\n\nAt last Gerard was seen at some distance with a female in his hand.\n\n\"She is long enough,\" said one of her sex, criticising her from afar.\n\n\"Gemini! what steps she takes,\" said another. \"Oh! it is wise to hurry\ninto good company,\" was Pietro's excuse.\n\nBut when the pair came up, satire was choked.\n\nGerard's companion was a peerless beauty; she extinguished the\nboat-load, as stars the rising sun. Tall, but not too tall; and straight\nas a dart, yet supple as a young panther. Her face a perfect oval, her\nforehead white, her cheeks a rich olive with the eloquent blood mantling\nbelow and her glorious eyes fringed with long thick silken eyelashes,\nthat seemed made to sweep up sensitive hearts by the half dozen. Saucy\nred lips, and teeth of the whitest ivory.\n\nThe women were visibly depressed by this wretched sight; the men in\necstasies; they received her with loud shouts and waving of caps, and\none enthusiast even went down on his knees upon the boat's gunwale, and\nhailed her of origin divine. But his chere amie pulling his hair for\nit--and the goddess giving him a little kick--cotemporaneously, he lay\nsupine; and the peerless creature frisked over his body without deigning\nhim a look, and took her seat at the prow. Pietro Vanucci sat in a sort\nof collapse, glaring at her, and gaping with his mouth open like a dying\ncod-fish.\n\nThe drover spoke to the buffaloes, the ropes tightened, and they moved\nup stream.\n\n\"What think ye of this new beef, mesdames?\"\n\n\"We ne'er saw monsters so viley ill-favoured; with their nasty horns\nthat make one afeard, and, their foul nostrils cast up into the air.\nHoles be they; not nostrils.\"\n\n\"Signorina, the beeves are a present from Florence the beautiful Would\nye look a gift beef i' the nose?\"\n\n\"They are so dull,\" objected a lively lady. \"I went up Tiber twice as\nfast last time with but five mules and an ass.\"\n\n\"Nay, that is soon mended,\" cried a gallant, and jumping ashore he drew\nhis sword, and despite the remonstrances of the drivers, went down the\ndozen buffaloes goading them.\n\nThey snorted and whisked their tails, and went no faster, at which the\nboat-load laughed loud and long: finally he goaded a patriarch bull,\nwho turned instantly on the sword, sent his long horns clean through the\nspark, and with a furious jerk of his prodigious neck sent him flying\nover his head into the air. He described a bold parabola and fell\nsitting, and unconsciously waving his glittering blade, into the yellow\nTiber. The laughing ladies screamed and wrung their hands, all but\nGerard's fair. She uttered something very like an oath, and seizing the\nhelm steered the boat out, and the gallant came up sputtering, griped\nthe gunwale, and was drawn in dripping.\n\nHe glared round him confusedly. \"I understand not that,\" said he, a\nlittle peevishly; puzzled, and therefore, it would seem, discontented.\nAt which, finding he was by some strange accident not slain, his doublet\nbeing perforated, instead of his body, they began to laugh again louder\nthan ever.\n\n\"What are ye cackling at?\" remonstrated the spark, \"I desire to know\nhow 'tis that one moment a gentleman is out yonder a pricking of African\nbeef, and the next moment--\"\n\nGerard's lady. \"Disporting in his native stream.\"\n\n\"Tell him not, a soul of ye,\" cried Vanucci. \"Let him find out 's own\nriddle.\"\n\nConfound ye all. I might puzzle my brains till doomsday, I should ne'er\nfind it out. Also, where is my sword?\n\nGerard's lady. \"Ask Tiber! Your best way, signor, will be to do it over\nagain; and, in a word, keep pricking of Afric's beef, till your mind\nreceives light. So shall you comprehend the matter by degrees, as\nlawyers mount heaven, and buffaloes Tiber.\"\n\nHere a chevalier remarked that the last speaker transcended the sons of\nAdam as much in wit as she did the daughters of Eve in beauty.\n\nAt which, and indeed at all their compliments, the conduct of Pietro\nVanucci was peculiar. That signor had left off staring, and gaping\nbewildered; and now sat coiled up snake-like, on each, his mouth\nmuffled, and two bright eyes fixed on the' lady, and twinkling and\nscintillating most comically.\n\nHe did not appear to interest or amuse her in return. Her glorious eyes\nand eyelashes swept him calmly at times, but scarce distinguished him\nfrom the benches and things.\n\nPresently the unanimity of the party suffered a momentary check.\n\nMortified by the attention the cavaliers paid to Gerard's companion, the\nladies began to pick her to pieces sotto voce, and audibly.\n\nThe lovely girl then showed that, if rich in beauty, she was poor in\nfeminine tact. Instead of revenging herself like a true woman through\nthe men, she permitted herself to overhear, and openly retaliate on her\ndetractors.\n\n\"There is not one of you that wears Nature's colours,\" said she. \"Look\nhere,\" and she pointed rudely in one's face. \"This is the beauty that is\nto be bought in every shop. Here is cerussa, here is stibium, and\nhere purpurissum. Oh, I know the articles bless you, I use them every\nday--but not on my face, no thank you.\"\n\nHere Vanucci's eyes twinkled themselves nearly out of sight.\n\n\"Why, your lips are coloured, and the very veins in your forehead: not a\ncharm but would come off with a wet towel. And look at your great coarse\nblack hair like a horse's tail, drugged and stained to look like tow.\nAnd then your bodies are as false as your heads and your cheeks, and\nyour hearts I trow. Look at your padded bosoms, and your wooden heeled\nchopines to raise your little stunted limbs up and deceive the world.\nSkinny dwarfs ye are, cushioned and stultified into great fat giants.\nAha, mesdames, well is it said of you, grande--di legni: grosse--di\nstraci: rosse--di bettito: bianche--di calcina.\"\n\nThis drew out a rejoinder. \"Avaunt, vulgar toad, telling the men\neverything. Your coarse, ruddy cheeks are your own, and your little\nhandful of African hair. But who is padded more? Why, you are shaped\nlike a fire-shovel.\"\n\n\"Ye lie, malapert.\"\n\n\"Oh, the well-educated young person! Where didst pick her up, Ser\nGerard?\"\n\n\"Hold thy peace, Marcia,\" said Gerard, awakened by the raised trebles\nfrom a gloomy reverie. \"Be not so insolent! The grave shall close over\nthy beauty as it hath over fairer than thee.\"\n\n\"They began,\" said Marcia petulantly.\n\n\"Then be thou the first to leave off.\"\n\n\"At thy request, my friend.\" She then whispered Gerard, \"It was only to\nmake you laugh; you are distraught, you are sad. Judge whether I care\nfor the quips of these little fools, or the admiration of these big\nfools. Dear Signor Gerard, would I were what they take me for? You\nshould not be so sad.\"\n\nGerard sighed deeply; and shook his head. But touched by the earnest\nyoung tones, caressed the jet black locks, much as one strokes the head\nof an affectionate dog.\n\nAt this moment a galley drifting slowly down stream got entangled for an\ninstant in their ropes: for, the river turning suddenly, they had shot\nout into the stream; and this galley came between them and the bank. In\nit a lady of great beauty was seated under a canopy with gallants and\ndependents standing behind her.\n\nGerard looked up at the interruption. It was the Princess Claelia.\n\nHe coloured and withdrew his hand from Marcia's head.\n\nMarcia was all admiration. \"Aha! ladies,\" said she, \"here is a rival an\nye will. Those cheeks were coloured by Nature-like mine.\"\n\n\"Peace, child! peace!\" said Gerard. \"Make not too free with the great.\"\n\n\"Why, she heard me not. Oh, Ser Gerard, what a lovely creature!\"\n\nTwo of the females had been for some time past putting their heads\ntogether and casting glances at Marcia.\n\nOne of them now addressed her.\n\n\"Signorina, do you love almonds?\"\n\nThe speaker had a lapful of them.\n\n\"Yes, I love them; when I can get them,\" said Marcia pettishly, and\neyeing the fruit with ill-concealed desire; \"but yours is not the hand\nto give me any, I trow.\"\n\n\"You are much mistook,\" said the other. \"Here, catch!\" And suddenly\nthrew a double handful into Marcia's lap.\n\nMarcia brought her knees together by an irresistible instinct.\n\n\"Aha! you are caught, my lad,\" cried she of the nuts. \"'Tis a man; or a\nboy. A woman still parteth her knees to catch the nuts the surer in her\napron; but a man closeth his for fear they should all between his hose.\nConfess, now, didst never wear fardingale ere to-day?\"\n\n\"Give me another handful, sweetheart, and I'll tell thee.\"\n\n\"There! I said he was too handsome for a woman.\"\n\n\"Ser Gerard, they have found me out,\" observed the Epicaene, calmly\ncracking an almond.\n\nThe libertines vowed it was impossible, and all glared at the goddess\nlike a battery. But Vanucci struck in, and reminded the gaping gazers\nof a recent controversy, in which they had, with a unanimity not often\nfound among dunces, laughed Gerard and him to scorn, for saying that men\nwere as beautiful as women in a true artist's eye.\n\n\"Where are ye now? This is my boy Andrea. And you have all been down on\nyour knees to him. Ha! ha! But oh, my little ladies, when he lectured\nyou and flung your stibium, your cerussa, and your purpurissum back in\nyour faces, 'tis then I was like to burst; a grinds my colours. Ha! ha!\nhe! he! he! ho!\"\n\n\"The little impostor! Duck him!\"\n\n\"What for, signors?\" cried Andrea, in dismay, and lost his rich\ncarnation.\n\nBut the females collected round him, and vowed nobody should harm a hair\nof his head.\n\n\"The dear child! How well his pretty little saucy ways become him.\"\n\n\"Oh, what eyes and teeth!\"\n\n\"And what eyebrows and hair!\"\n\n\"And what lashes!\"\n\n\"And what a nose!\"\n\n\"The sweetest little ear in the world!\"\n\n\"And what health! Touch but his cheek with a pin the blood should\nsquirt.\"\n\n\"Who would be so cruel?\"\n\n\"He is a rosebud washed in dew.\"\n\nAnd they revenged themselves for their beaux' admiration of her by\nlavishing all their tenderness on him.\n\nBut one there was who was still among these butterflies, but no longer\nof them. The sight of the Princess Claelia had torn open his wound.\n\nScarce three months ago he had declined the love of that peerless\ncreature; a love illicit and insane; but at least refined.\n\nHow much lower had he fallen now.\n\nHow happy he must have been, when the blandishments of Claelia, that\nmight have melted an anchorite, could not tempt him from the path of\nloyalty!\n\nNow what was he? He had blushed at her seeing him in such company. Yet\nit was his daily company.\n\nHe hung over the boat in moody silence.\n\nAnd from that hour another phase of his misery began; and grew upon him.\n\nSome wretched fools try to drown care in drink.\n\nThe fumes of intoxication vanish; the inevitable care remains, and must\nbe faced at last--with an aching head, disordered stomach, and spirits\nartificially depressed.\n\nGerard's conduct had been of a piece with these maniacs'. To survive\nhis terrible blow he needed all his forces; his virtue, his health, his\nhabits of labour, and the calm sleep that is labour's satellite; above\nall, his piety.\n\nYet all these balms to wounded hearts he flung away and trusted to moral\nintoxication.\n\nIts brief fumes fled; the bereaved heart lay still heavy as lead within\nhis bosom; but now the dark vulture Remorse sat upon it rending it.\n\nBroken health; means wasted; innocence fled; Margaret parted from him by\nanother gulf wider than the grave! The hot fit of despair passed away.\n\nThe cold fit of despair came on.\n\nThen this miserable young man spurned his gay companions, and all the\nworld.\n\nHe wandered alone. He drank wine alone to stupefy himself; and paralyze\na moment the dark foes to man that preyed upon his soul. He wandered\nalone amidst the temples of old Rome, and lay stony eyed, woebegone,\namong their ruins, worse wrecked than they.\n\nLast of all came the climax, to which solitude, that gloomy yet\nfascinating foe of minds diseased, pushes the hopeless.\n\nHe wandered alone at night by dark streams, and eyed them, and\neyed them, with decreasing repugnance. There glided peace; perhaps\nannihilation.\n\nWhat else was left him?\n\nThese dark spells have been broken by kind words, by loving and cheerful\nvoices.\n\nThe humblest friend the afflicted one possesses may speak, or look, or\nsmile, a sunbeam between him and that worst madness Gerard now brooded.\n\nWhere was Teresa? Where his hearty, kind old landlady?\n\nThey would see with their homely but swift intelligence; they would see\nand save.\n\nNo; they knew not where he was, or whither he was gliding.\n\nAnd is there no mortal eye upon the poor wretch, and the dark road he is\ngoing?\n\nYes; one eye there is upon him; watching his every movement; following\nhim abroad; tracking him home.\n\nAnd that eye is the eye of an enemy.\n\nAn enemy to the death.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIV\n\nIn an apartment richly furnished, the floor covered with striped and\nspotted skins of animals, a lady sat with her arms extended before her,\nand her hands half clenched. The agitation of her face corresponded with\nthis attitude; she was pale and red by turns; and her foot restless.\n\nPresently the curtain was drawn by a domestic.\n\nThe lady's brow flushed.\n\nThe maid said, in an awe-struck whisper: \"Altezza, the man is here.\"\n\nThe lady bade her admit him, and snatched up a little black mask and put\nit on; and in a moment her colour was gone, and the contrast between her\nblack mask and her marble cheeks was strange and fearful.\n\nA man entered bowing and scraping. It was such a figure as crowds seem\nmade of; short hair, roundish head, plain, but decent clothes; features\nneither comely not forbidding. Nothing to remark in him but a singularly\nrestless eye.\n\nAfter a profusion of bows he stood opposite the lady, and awaited her\npleasure.\n\n\"They have told you for what you are wanted?\"\n\n\"Yes, Signora.\"\n\n\"Did those who spoke to you agree as to what you are to receive?\"\n\n\"Yes, Signora. 'Tis the full price; and purchases the greater vendetta:\nunless of your benevolence you choose to content yourself with the\nlesser.\"\n\n\"I understand you not,\" said the lady.\n\n\"Ah; this is the Signora's first. The lesser vendetta, lady, is the\ndeath of the body only. We watch our man come out of a church; or take\nhim in an innocent hour; and so deal with him. In the greater vendetta\nwe watch him, and catch him hot from some unrepented sin, and so slay\nhis soul as well as his body. But this vendetta is not so run upon now\nas it was a few years ago.\"\n\n\"Man, silence me his tongue, and let his treasonable heart beat no more.\nBut his soul I have no feud with.\"\n\n\"So be it, signora. He who spoke to me knew not the man, nor his name,\nnor his abode. From whom shall I learn these?\"\n\n\"From myself.\"\n\nAt this the man, with the first symptoms of anxiety he had shown,\nentreated her to be cautious, and particular, in this part of the\nbusiness.\n\n\"Fear me not,\" said she. \"Listen. It is a young man, tall of stature,\nand auburn hair, and dark blue eyes, and an honest face, would deceive\na saint. He lives in the Via Claudia, at the corner house; the glover's.\nIn that house there lodge but three males: he; and a painter short of\nstature and dark visaged, and a young, slim boy. He that hath betrayed\nme is a stranger, fair, and taller than thou art.\"\n\nThe bravo listened with all his ears. \"It is enough,\" said he.\n\n\"Stay, Signora; haunteth he any secret place where I may deal with him?\"\n\n\"My spy doth report me he hath of late frequented the banks of Tiber\nafter dusk; doubtless to meet his light o' love, who calls me her rival;\neven there slay him! and let my rival come and find him; the smooth,\nheartless, insolent traitor.\"\n\n\"Be calm, signora. He will betray no more ladies.\"\n\n\"I know not that. He weareth a sword, and can use it. He is young and\nresolute.\"\n\n\"Neither will avail him.\"\n\n\"Are ye so sure of your hand? What are your weapons?\"\n\nThe bravo showed her a steel gauntlet. \"We strike with such force\nwe need must guard our hand. This is our mallet.\" He then undid his\ndoublet, and gave her a glimpse of a coat of mail beneath, and finally\nlaid his glittering stiletto on the table with a flourish.\n\nThe lady shuddered at first, but presently took it up in her white hand\nand tried its point against her finger.\n\n\"Beware, madam,\" said the bravo.\n\n\"What, is it poisoned?\"\n\n\"Saints forbid! We steal no lives. We take them with steel point, not\ndrugs. But 'tis newly ground, and I feared for the Signora's white\nskin.\"\n\n\"His skin is as white as mine,\" said she, with a sudden gleam of pity.\nIt lasted but a moment. \"But his heart is black as soot. Say, do I not\nwell to remove a traitor that slanders me?\"\n\n\"The signora will settle that with her confessor. I am but a tool in\nnoble hands; like my stiletto.\"\n\nThe princess appeared not to hear the speaker. \"Oh, how I could have\nloved him; to the death; as now I hate him. Fool! he will learn to\ntrifle with princes; to spurn them and fawn on them, and prefer the\nscum of the town to them, and make them a by-word.\" She looked up. \"Why\nloiter'st thou here? haste thee, revenge me.\"\n\n\"It is customary to pay half the price beforehand, Signora.\"\n\n\"Ah I forgot; thy revenge is bought. Here is more than half,\" and she\npushed a bag across the table to him. \"When the blow is struck, come for\nthe rest.\"\n\n\"You will soon see me again, signora.\"\n\nAnd he retired bowing and scraping.\n\nThe princess, burning with jealousy, mortified pride, and dread of\nexposure (for till she knew Gerard no public stain had fallen on her),\nsat where he left her, masked, with her arms straight out before her,\nand the nails of her clenched hand nipping the table.\n\nSo sat the fabled sphynx: so sits a tigress.\n\nYet there crept a chill upon her now that the assassin was gone. And\nmoody misgivings heaved within her, precursors of vain remorse. Gerard\nand Margaret were before their age. This was your true mediaeval.\nProud, amorous, vindictive, generous, foolish, cunning, impulsive,\nunprincipled: and ignorant as dirt.\n\nPower is the curse of such a creature.\n\nForced to do her own crimes, the weakness of her nerves would have\nbalanced the violence of her passions, and her bark been worse than her\nbite. But power gives a feeble, furious woman, male instruments. And the\neffect is as terrible as the combination is unnatural.\n\nIn this instance it whetted an assassin's dagger for a poor forlorn\nwretch just meditating suicide.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXV\n\nIt happened, two days after the scene I have endeavoured to describe,\nthat Gerard, wandering through one of the meanest streets in Rome, was\novertaken by a thunderstorm, and entered a low hostelry. He called for\nwine, and the rain continuing, soon drank himself into a half stupid\ncondition, and dozed with his head on his hands and his hands upon the\ntable.\n\nIn course of time the room began to fill and the noise of the rude\nguests to wake him.\n\nThen it was he became conscious of two figures near him conversing in a\nlow voice.\n\nOne was a pardoner. The other by his dress, clean but modest, might have\npassed for a decent tradesman; but the way he had slouched his hat over\nhis brows, so as to hide all his face except his beard, showed he was\none of those who shun the eye of honest men, and of the law. The pair\nwere driving a bargain in the sin market. And by an arrangement\nnot uncommon at that date, the crime to be forgiven was yet to be\ncommitted--under the celestial contract.\n\nHe of the slouched hat was complaining of the price pardons had reached.\n\"If they go up any higher we poor fellows shall be shut out of heaven\naltogether.\"\n\nThe pardoner denied the charge flatly. \"Indulgences were never cheaper\nto good husbandmen.\"\n\nThe other inquired, \"Who were they?\"\n\n\"Why, such as sin by the market, like reasonable creatures. But if you\nwill be so perverse as go and pick out a crime the Pope hath set his\nface against, blame yourself, not me!\"\n\nThen, to prove that crime of one sort or another was within the means of\nall but the very scum of society, he read out the scale from a written\nparchment.\n\nIt was a curious list; but not one that could be printed in this book.\nAnd to mutilate it would be to misrepresent it. It is to be found in\nany great library. Suffice it to say that murder of a layman was much\ncheaper than many crimes my lay readers would deem light by comparison.\n\nThis told; and by a little trifling concession on each side, the bargain\nwas closed, the money handed over, and the aspirant to heaven's favour\nforgiven beforehand for removing one layman. The price for disposing of\na clerk bore no proportion.\n\nThe word assassination was never once uttered by either merchant.\n\nAll this buzzed in Gerard's ear. But he never lifted his head from the\ntable; only listened stupidly.\n\nHowever, when the parties rose and separated, he half raised his head,\nand eyed with a scowl the retiring figure of the purchaser.\n\n\"If Margaret was alive,\" muttered he, \"I'd take thee by the throat and\nthrottle thee, thou cowardly stabber. But she is dead; dead; dead. Die\nall the world; 'tis nought to me: so that I die among the first.\"\n\nWhen he got home there was a man in a slouched hat walking briskly to\nand fro on the opposite side of the way.\n\n\"Why, there is that cur again,\" thought Gerard.\n\nBut in this state of mind, the circumstance made no impression whatever\non him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVI\n\nTwo nights after this Pietro Vanucci and Andrea sat waiting supper for\nGerard.\n\nThe former grew peevish. It was past nine o'clock. At last he sent\nAndrea to Gerard's room on the desperate chance of his having come in\nunobserved. Andrea shrugged his shoulders and went.\n\nHe returned without Gerard, but with a slip of paper. Andrea could not\nread, as scholars in his day and charity boys in ours understand the\nart; but he had a quick eye, and had learned how the words Pietro\nVanucci looked on paper.\n\n\"That is for you, I trow,\" said he, proud of his intelligence.\n\nPietro snatched it, and read it to Andrea, with his satirical comments.\n\n\"'Dear Pietro, dear Andrea, life is too great a burden.'\n\n\"So 'tis, my lad,' but that is no reason for being abroad at\nsupper-time. Supper is not a burden.\"\n\n\"'Wear my habits!'\n\n\"Said the poplar to the juniper bush.\"\n\n\"'And thou, Andrea, mine amethyst ring; and me in both your hearts a\nmonth or two.'\n\n\"Why, Andrea?\"\n\n\"'For my body, ere this ye read, it will lie in Tiber. Trouble not to\nlook for it. 'Tis not worth the pains. Oh unhappy day that it was born\noh happy night that rids me of it.\n\n\"'Adieu! adieu!\n\n\"'The broken-hearted Gerard.'\n\n\"Here is a sorry jest of the peevish rogue,\" said Pietro. But his pale\ncheek and chattering teeth belied his words. Andrea filled the house\nwith his cries.\n\n\"O, miserable day! O, calamity of calamities! Gerard, my friend, my\nsweet patron! Help! help! He is killing himself! Oh, good people, help\nme save him!\" And after alarming all the house he ran into the street,\nbareheaded, imploring all good Christians to help him save his friend.\n\nA number of persons soon collected.\n\nBut poor Andrea could not animate their sluggishness. Go down to the\nriver? No. It was not their business. What part of the river? It was a\nwild goose chase.\n\nIt was not lucky to go down to the river after sunset. Too many ghosts\nwalked those banks all night.\n\nA lackey, however, who had been standing some time opposite the house,\nsaid he would go with Andrea; and this turned three or four of the\nyounger ones.\n\nThe little band took the way to the river.\n\nThe lackey questioned Andrea.\n\nAndrea, sobbing, told him about the letter, and Gerard's moody ways of\nlate.\n\nThat lackey was a spy of the Princess Claelia.\n\nTheir Italian tongues went fast till they neared the Tiber.\n\nBut the moment they felt the air from the river, and the smell of the\nstream in the calm spring night, they were dead silent.\n\nThe moon shone calm and clear in a cloudless sky. Their feet sounded\nloud and ominous. Their tongues were hushed.\n\nPresently hurrying round a corner they met a man. He stopped irresolute\nat sight of them.\n\nThe man was bareheaded, and his dripping hair glistened in the\nmoonlight; and at the next step they saw his clothes were drenched with\nwater.\n\n\"Here he is,\" cried one of the young men, unacquainted with Gerard's\nface and figure.\n\nThe stranger turned instantly and fled.\n\nThey ran after him might and main, Andrea leading, and the princess's\nlackey next.\n\nAndrea gained on him; but in a moment he twisted up a narrow alley.\nAndrea shot by, unable to check himself; and the pursuers soon found\nthemselves in a labyrinth in which it was vain to pursue a quickfooted\nfugitive who knew every inch of it, and could now only be followed by\nthe ear.\n\nThey returned to their companions, and found them standing on the spot\nwhere the man had stood, and utterly confounded. For Pietro had assured\nthem that the fugitive had neither the features nor the stature of\nGerard.\n\n\"Are ye verily sure?\" said they. \"He had been in the river. Why, in the\nsaints' names, fled he at our approach?\"\n\nThen said Vanucci, \"Friends, methinks this has nought to do with him we\nseek. What shall we do, Andrea?\"\n\nHere the lackey put in his word. \"Let us track him to the water's side,\nto make sure. See, he hath come dripping all the way.\"\n\nThis advice was approved, and with very little difficulty they tracked\nthe man's course.\n\nBut soon they encountered a new enigma.\n\nThey had gone scarcely fifty yards ere the drops turned away from the\nriver, and took them to the gate of a large gloomy building. It was a\nmonastery.\n\nThey stood irresolute before it, and gazed at the dark pile.\n\nIt seemed to them to hide some horrible mystery.\n\nBut presently Andrea gave a shout. \"Here be the drops again,\" cried he.\n\"And this road leadeth to the river.\"\n\nThey resumed the chase; and soon it became clear the drops were now\nleading them home. The track became wetter and wetter, and took them\nto the Tiber's edge. And there on the bank a bucketful appeared to have\nbeen discharged from the stream.\n\nAt first they shouted, and thought they had made a discovery: but\nreflection showed them it amounted to nothing. Certainly a man had been\nin the water, and had got out of it in safety; but that man was not\nGerard. One said he knew a fisherman hard by that had nets and drags.\nThey found the fisherman and paid him liberally to sink nets in the\nriver below the place, and to drag it above and below; and promised him\ngold should he find the body. Then they ran vainly up and down the river\nwhich flowed so calm and voiceless, holding this and a thousand more\nstrange secrets. Suddenly Andrea, with a cry of hope, ran back to the\nhouse.\n\nHe returned in less than half an hour.\n\n\"No,\" he groaned, and wrung his hands.\n\n\"What is the hour?\" asked the lackey.\n\n\"Four hours past midnight.\"\n\n\"My pretty lad,\" said the lackey solemnly, \"say a mass for thy friend's\nsoul: for he is not among living men.\"\n\nThe morning broke. Worn out with fatigue, Andrea and Pietro went home,\nheart sick.\n\nThe days rolled on, mute as the Tiber as to Gerard's fate.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVII\n\nIt would indeed have been strange if with such barren data as they\npossessed, those men could have read the handwriting on the river's\nbank.\n\nFor there on that spot an event had just occurred, which, take it\naltogether, was perhaps without a parallel in the history of mankind,\nand may remain so to the end of time.\n\nBut it shall be told in a very few words, partly by me, partly by an\nactor in the scene.\n\nGerard, then, after writing his brief adieu to Pietro and Andrea, had\nstolen down to the river at nightfall.\n\nHe had taken his measures with a dogged resolution not uncommon in those\nwho are bent on self-destruction. He filled his pockets with all the\nsilver and copper he possessed, that he might sink the surer; and so\nprovided, hurried to a part of the stream that he had seen was little\nfrequented.\n\nThere are some, especially women, who look about to make sure there is\nsomebody at hand.\n\nBut this resolute wretch looked about him to make sure there was nobody.\n\nAnd to his annoyance, he observed a single figure leaning against\nthe corner of an alley. So he affected to stroll carelessly away; but\nreturned to the spot.\n\nLo! the same figure emerged from a side street and loitered about.\n\n\"Can he be watching me? Can he know what I am here for?\" thought Gerard.\n\"Impossible.\"\n\nHe went briskly off, walked along a street or two, made a detour and\ncame back.\n\nThe man had vanished. But lo! on Gerard looking all round, to make sure,\nthere he was a few yards behind, apparently fastening his shoe.\n\nGerard saw he was watched, and at this moment observed in the moonlight\na steel gauntlet in his sentinel's hand.\n\nThen he knew it was an assassin.\n\nStrange to say, it never occurred to him that his was the life aimed at.\nTo be sure he was not aware he had an enemy in the world.\n\nHe turned and walked up to the bravo. \"My good friend,\" said he eagerly,\n\"sell me thine arm! a single stroke! See, here is all I have;\" and he\nforced his money into the bravo's hands.\n\n\"Oh, prithee! prithee! do one good deed, and rid me of my hateful life!\"\nand even while speaking he undid his doublet and bared his bosom.\n\nThe man stared in his face.\n\n\"Why do ye hesitate?\" shrieked Gerard. \"Have ye no bowels? Is it so much\npains to lift your arm and fall it? Is it because I am poor, and can't\ngive ye gold? Useless wretch, canst only strike a man behind; not look\none in the face. There, then, do but turn thy head and hold thy tongue!\"\n\nAnd with a snarl of contempt he ran from him, and flung himself into the\nwater.\n\n\"Margaret!\"\n\nAt the heavy plunge of his body in the stream the bravo seemed to\nrecover from a stupor. He ran to the bank, and with a strange cry the\nassassin plunged in after the self-destroyer.\n\nWhat followed will be related by the assassin.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXVIII\n\nA woman has her own troubles, as a man has his. And we male writers\nseldom do more than indicate the griefs of the other sex. The\nintelligence of the female reader must come to our aid, and fill up our\ncold outlines. So have I indicated, rather than described, what Margaret\nBrandt went through up to that eventful day, when she entered Eli's\nhouse an enemy, read her sweetheart's letter, and remained a friend.\n\nAnd now a woman's greatest trial drew near, and Gerard far away.\n\nShe availed herself but little of Eli's sudden favour; for this reserve\nshe had always a plausible reason ready; and never hinted at the true\none, which was this; there were two men in that house at sight of\nwhom she shuddered with instinctive antipathy and dread. She had read\nwickedness and hatred in their faces, and mysterious signals of secret\nintelligence. She preferred to receive Catherine and her daughter at\nhome. The former went to see her every day, and was wrapped up in the\nexpected event.\n\nCatherine was one of those females whose office is to multiply, and rear\nthe multiplied: who, when at last they consent to leave off pelting\none out of every room in the house with babies, hover about the fair\nscourges that are still in full swing, and do so cluck, they seem to\nmultiply by proxy. It was in this spirit she entreated Eli to let her\nstay at Rotterdam, while he went back to Tergou.\n\n\"The poor lass hath not a soul about her, that knows anything about\nanything. What avail a pair o' soldiers? Why, that sort o' cattle should\nbe putten out o' doors the first, at such an a time.\"\n\nNeed I say that this was a great comfort to Margaret.\n\nPoor soul, she was full of anxiety as the time drew near.\n\nShe should die; and Gerard away.\n\nBut things balance themselves. Her poverty, and her father's\nhelplessness, which had cost her such a struggle, stood her in good\nstead now.\n\nAdversity's iron hand had forced her to battle the lassitude that\noverpowers the rich of her sex, and to be for ever on her feet, working.\nShe kept this up to the last by Catherine's advice.\n\nAnd so it was, that one fine evening, just at sunset, she lay weak\nas water, but safe; with a little face by her side, and the heaven of\nmaternity opening on her.\n\n\"Why dost weep, sweetheart? All of a sudden?\"\n\n\"He is not here to see it.\"\n\n\"Ah, well, lass, he will be here ere 'tis weaned. Meantime God hath\nbeen as good to thee as to e'er a woman born; and do but bethink thee\nit might have been a girl; didn't my very own Kate threaten me with one;\nand here we have got the bonniest boy in Holland, and a rare heavy one,\nthe saints be praised for't.\"\n\n\"Ay, mother, I am but a sorry, ungrateful wretch to weep. If only Gerard\nwere here to see it. 'Tis strange; I bore him well enow to be away from\nme in my sorrow; but oh, it does seem so hard he should not share my\njoy. Prithee, prithee, come to me, Gerard! dear, dear Gerard!\" And she\nstretched out her feeble arms.\n\nCatherine hustled about, but avoided Margaret's eyes; for she could not\nrestrain her own tears at hearing her own absent child thus earnestly\naddressed.\n\nPresently, turning round, she found Margaret looking at her with a\nsingular expression. \"Heard you nought?\"\n\n\"No, my lamb. What?\"\n\n\"I did cry on Gerard, but now.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, sure I heard that.\"\n\n\"Well, he answered me.\"\n\n\"Tush, girl: say not that.\"\n\n\"Mother, as sure as I lie here, with his boy by my side, his voice came\nback to me, 'Margaret!' So. Yet methought 'twas not his happy voice. But\nthat might be the distance. All voices go off sad like at a distance.\nWhy art not happy, sweetheart? and I so happy this night? Mother, I seem\nnever to have felt a pain or known a care.\" And her sweet eyes turned\nand gloated on the little face in silence.\n\nThat very night Gerard flung himself into the Tiber. And that very\nhour she heard him speak her name, he cried aloud in death's jaws and\ndespair's.\n\n\"Margaret!\"\n\nAccount for it those who can. I cannot.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXIX\n\nIn the guest chamber of a Dominican convent lay a single stranger,\nexhausted by successive and violent fits of nausea, which had at last\nsubsided, leaving him almost as weak as Margaret lay that night in\nHolland.\n\nA huge wood fire burned on the hearth, and beside it hung the patient's\nclothes.\n\nA gigantic friar sat by his bedside, reading pious collects aloud from\nhis breviary.\n\nThe patient at times eyed him, and seemed to listen: at others closed\nhis eyes and moaned.\n\nThe monk kneeled down with his face touching the ground and prayed for\nhim; then rose and bade him farewell. \"Day breaks,\" said he; \"I must\nprepare for matins.\"\n\n\"Good Father Jerome, before you go, how came I hither?\"\n\n\"By the hand of Heaven. You flung away God's gift. He bestowed it on you\nagain. Think on it! Hast tried the world and found its gall. Now try the\nChurch! The Church is peace. Pax vobiscum.\"\n\nHe was gone. Gerard lay back, meditating and wondering, till weak and\nwearied he fell into a doze.\n\nWhen he awoke again he found a new nurse seated beside him. It was a\nlayman, with an eye as small and restless as Friar Jerome's was calm and\nmajestic.\n\nThe man inquired earnestly how he felt.\n\n\"Very, very weak. Where have I seen you before, messer?\"\n\n\"None the worse for my gauntlet?\" inquired the other, with considerable\nanxiety; \"I was fain to strike you withal, or both you and I should be\nat the bottom of Tiber.\"\n\nGerard stared at him. \"What, 'twas you saved me? How?\"\n\n\"Well, signor, I was by the banks of Tiber on-on an errand, no matter\nwhat. You came to me and begged hard for a dagger stroke. But ere I\ncould oblige you, ay, even as you spoke to me, I knew you for the signor\nthat saved my wife and child upon the sea.\"\n\n\"It is Teresa's husband. And an assassin?!!?\"\n\n\"At your service. Well, Ser Gerard, the next thing was, you flung\nyourself into Tiber, and bade me hold aloof.\"\n\n\"I remember that.\"\n\n\"Had it been any but you, believe me I had obeyed you, and not wagged a\nfinger. Men are my foes. They may all hang on one rope, or drown in one\nriver for me. But when thou, sinking in Tiber, didst cry 'Margaret!'\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"My heart it cried 'Teresa!' How could I go home and look her in the\nface, did I let thee die, and by the very death thou savedst her from?\nSo in I went; and luckily for us both I swim like a duck. You, seeing\nme near, and being bent on destruction, tried to grip me, and so end us\nboth. But I swam round thee, and (receive my excuses) so buffeted thee\non the nape of the neck with my steel glove; that thou lost sense, and\nI with much ado, the stream being strong, did draw thy body to land, but\ninsensible and full of water. Then I took thee on my back and made for\nmy own home. 'Teresa will nurse him, and be pleased with me,' thought I.\nBut hard by this monastery, a holy friar, the biggest e'er I saw, met us\nand asked the matter. So I told him. He looked hard at thee. 'I know\nthe face,' quoth he. ''Tis one Gerard, a fair youth from Holland.'\n'The same,' quo' I. Then said his reverence, 'He hath friends among our\nbrethren. Leave him with us! Charity, it is our office.'\n\n\"Also he told me they of the convent had better means to tend thee than\nI had. And that was true enow. So I just bargained to be let in to see\nthee once a day, and here thou art.\"\n\nAnd the miscreant cast a strange look of affection and interest upon\nGerard.\n\nGerard did not respond to it. He felt as if a snake were in the room. He\nclosed his eyes.\n\n\"Ah, thou wouldst sleep,\" said the miscreant eagerly. \"I go.\" And he\nretired on tip-toe with a promise to come every day.\n\nGerard lay with his eyes closed: not asleep, but deeply pondering.\n\nSaved from death, by an assassin\n\nWas not this the finger of Heaven?\n\nOf that Heaven he had insulted, cursed, and defied.\n\nHe shuddered at his blasphemies. He tried to pray.\n\nHe found he could utter prayers. But he could not pray.\n\n\"I am doomed eternally,\" he cried, \"doomed, doomed.\"\n\nThe organ of the convent church burst on his ear in rich and solemn\nharmony.\n\nThen rose the voices of the choir chanting a full service.\n\nAmong them was one that seemed to hover above the others, and tower\ntowards heaven; a sweet boy's voice, full, pure, angelic.\n\nHe closed his eyes and listened. The days of his own boyhood flowed back\nupon him in those sweet, pious harmonies. No earthly dross there, no\nfoul, fierce passions, rending and corrupting the soul.\n\nPeace, peace; sweet, balmy peace.\n\n\"Ay,\" he sighed, \"the Church is peace of mind. Till I left her bosom I\nne'er knew sorrow, nor sin.\"\n\nAnd the poor torn, worn creature wept.\n\nAnd even as he wept, there beamed on him the sweet and reverend face of\none he had never thought to see again. It was the face of Father Anselm.\n\nThe good father had only reached the convent the night before last.\nGerard recognized him in a moment, and cried to him, \"Oh, Father Anselm,\nyou cured my wounded body in Juliers: now cure my hurt soul in Rome!\nAlas, you cannot.\"\n\nAnselm sat down by the bedside, and putting a gentle hand on his head,\nfirst calmed him with a soothing word or two.\n\nHe then (for he had learned how Gerard came there) spoke to him kindly\nbut solemnly, and made him feel his crime, and urged him to repentance,\nand gratitude to that Divine Power which had thwarted his will to save\nhis soul.\n\n\"Come, my son,\" said he, \"first purge thy bosom of its load.\"\n\n\"Ah, father,\" said Gerard, \"in Juliers I could; then I was innocent but\nnow, impious monster that I am, I dare not confess to you.\"\n\n\"Why not, my son? Thinkest thou I have not sinned against Heaven in my\ntime, and deeply? oh, how deeply! Come, poor laden soul, pour forth thy\ngrief, pour forth thy faults, hold back nought! Lie not oppressed and\ncrushed by hidden sins.\"\n\nAnd soon Gerard was at Father Anselm's knees confessing his every sin\nwith sighs and groans of penitence.\n\n\"Thy sins are great,\" said Anselm. \"Thy temptation also was great,\nterribly great. I must consult our good prior.\"\n\nThe good Anselm kissed his brow, and left him, to consult the superior\nas to his penance.\n\nAnd lo! Gerard could pray now.\n\nAnd he prayed with all his heart.\n\nThe phase, through which this remarkable mind now passed, may be summed\nin a word--Penitence.\n\nHe turned with terror and aversion from the world, and begged\npassionately to remain in the convent. To him, convent nurtured, it was\nlike a bird returning wounded, wearied, to its gentle nest.\n\nHe passed his novitiate in prayer, and mortification, and pious reading\nand meditation.\n\n\nThe Princess Claelia's spy went home and told her that Gerard was\ncertainly dead, the manner of his death unknown at present.\n\nShe seemed literally stunned. When, after a long time, she found breath\nto speak at all, it was to bemoan her lot, cursed with such ready tools.\n\"So soon,\" she sighed; \"see how swift these monsters are to do ill\ndeeds. They come to us in our hot blood, and first tempt us with their\nvenal daggers, then enact the mortal deeds we ne'er had thought on but\nfor them.\"\n\nEre many hours had passed, her pity for Gerard and hatred of his\nmurderer had risen to fever heat; which with this fool was blood heat.\n\n\"Poor soul! I cannot call thee back to life. But he shall never live\nthat traitorously slew thee.\"\n\nAnd she put armed men in ambush, and kept them on guard all day, ready,\nwhen Lodovico should come for his money, to fall on him in a certain\nantechamber and hack him to pieces.\n\n\"Strike at his head,\" said she, \"for he weareth a privy coat of mail;\nand if he goes hence alive your own heads shall answer it.\"\n\nAnd so she sat weeping her victim, and pulling the strings of machines\nto shed the blood of a second for having been her machine to kill the\nfirst.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXX\n\nOne of the novice Gerard's self-imposed penances was to receive Lodovico\nkindly, feeling secretly as to a slimy serpent.\n\nNever was self-denial better bestowed; and like most rational penances,\nit soon became no penance at all. At first the pride and complacency,\nwith which the assassin gazed on the one life he had saved, was perhaps\nas ludicrous as pathetic; but it is a great thing to open a good door in\na heart. One good thing follows another through the aperture. Finding it\nso sweet to save life, the miscreant went on to be averse to taking\nit; and from that to remorse; and from remorse to something very like\npenitence. And here Teresa cooperated by threatening, not for the first\ntime, to leave him unless he would consent to lead an honest life. The\ngood fathers of the convent lent their aid, and Lodovico and Teresa\nwere sent by sea to Leghorn, where Teresa had friends, and the assassin\nsettled down and became a porter.\n\nHe found it miserably dull work at first; and said so.\n\nBut methinks this dull life of plodding labour was better for him, than\nthe brief excitement of being hewn in pieces by the Princess Claelia's\nmyrmidons. His exile saved the unconscious penitent from that fate; and\nthe princess, balked of her revenge, took to brooding, and fell into a\nprofound melancholy; dismissed her confessor, and took a new one with\na great reputation for piety, to whom she confided what she called her\ngriefs. The new confessor was no other than Fra Jerome. She could not\nhave fallen into better hands.\n\nHe heard her grimly out. Then took her and shook the delusions out of\nher as roughly as if she had been a kitchen-maid. For, to do this hard\nmonk justice, on the path of duty he feared the anger of princes as\nlittle as he did the sea. He showed her in a few words, all thunder and\nlightning, that she was the criminal of criminals.\n\n\"Thou art the devil, that with thy money hath tempted one man to slay\nhis fellow, and then, blinded with self-love, instead of blaming and\npunishing thyself, art thirsting for more blood of guilty men, but not\nso guilty as thou.\"\n\nAt first she resisted, and told him she was not used to be taken to task\nby her confessors. But he overpowered her, and so threatened her with\nthe Church's curse here and hereafter, and so tore the scales off her\neyes, and thundered at her, and crushed her, that she sank down and\ngrovelled with remorse and terror at the feet of the gigantic Boanerges.\n\n\"Oh, holy father, have pity on a poor weak woman, and help me save my\nguilty soul. I was benighted for want of ghostly counsel like thine,\ngood father. I waken as from a dream.\n\n\"Doff thy jewels,\" said Fra Jerome sternly.\n\n\"I will. I will.\"\n\n\"Doff thy silk and velvet; and in humbler garb than wears thy meanest\nservant, wend thou instant to Loretto.\"\n\n\"I will,\" said the princess faintly.\n\n\"No shoes; but a bare sandal.'\n\n\"No father.\"\n\n\"Wash the feet of pilgrims both going and coming; and to such of them as\nbe holy friars tell thy sin, and abide their admonition.\"\n\n\"Oh, holy father, let me wear my mask.\"\n\n\"Humph!\"\n\n\"Oh, mercy! Bethink thee! My features are known through Italy.\"\n\n\"Ay. Beauty is a curse to most of ye. Well, thou mayst mask thine eyes;\nno more.\"\n\nOn this concession she seized his hand, and was about to kiss it; but he\nsnatched it rudely from her.\n\n\"What would ye do? That hand handled the eucharist but an hour agone: is\nit fit for such as thou to touch it?\"\n\n\"Ah, no. But oh, go not without giving your penitent daughter your\nblessing.\"\n\n\"Time enow to ask it when you come back from Loretto.\"\n\n\nThus that marvellous occurrence by Tiber's banks left its mark on all\nthe actors, as prodigies are said to do. The assassin, softened by\nsaving the life he was paid to take, turned from the stiletto to the\nporter's knot. The princess went barefoot to Loretto, weeping her crime\nand washing the feet of base-born men.\n\nAnd Gerard, carried from the Tiber into that convent a suicide, now\npassed for a young saint within its walls.\n\nLoving but experienced eyes were on him.\n\nUpon a shorter probation than usual he was admitted to priest's orders.\n\nAnd soon after took the monastic vows, and became a friar of St.\nDominic.\n\nDying to the world, the monk parted with the very name by which he had\nlived in it, and so broke the last link of association with earthly\nfeelings.\n\nHere Gerard ended, and Brother Clement began.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXI\n\n\"As is the race of leaves so is that of men.\" And a great man budded\nunnoticed in a tailor's house at Rotterdam this year, and a large man\ndropped to earth with great eclat.\n\nPhilip, Duke of Burgundy, Earl of Holland, etc., etc., lay sick at\nBruges. Now paupers got sick and got well as Nature pleased; but woe\nbetided the rich in an age when, for one Mr. Malady killed three fell by\nDr. Remedy.\n\nThe Duke's complaint, nameless then, is now diphtheria. It is, and was,\na very weakening malady, and the Duke was old; so altogether Dr. Remedy\nbled him.\n\nThe Duke turned very cold: wonderful!\n\nThen Dr. Remedy had recourse to the arcana of science.\n\n\"Ho! This is grave. Flay me an ape incontinent, and clap him to the\nDuke's breast!\"\n\nOfficers of state ran septemvious, seeking an ape, to counteract the\nbloodthirsty tomfoolery of the human species.\n\nPerdition! The duke was out of apes. There were buffaloes, lizards,\nTurks, leopards; any unreasonable beast but the right one.\n\n\"Why, there used to be an ape about,\" said one. \"If I stand here I saw\nhim.\"\n\nSo there used; but the mastiff had mangled the sprightly creature for\nstealing his supper; and so fulfilled the human precept, \"Soyez de votre\nsiecle!\"\n\nIn this emergency the seneschal cast his despairing eyes around; and not\nin vain. A hopeful light shot into them.\n\n\"Here is this,\" said he, sotto voce. \"Surely this will serve: 'tis\naltogether apelike, doublet and hose apart.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said the chancellor peevishly, \"the Princess Marie would hang us.\nShe doteth on this.\"\n\nNow this was our friend Giles, strutting, all unconscious, in cloth of\ngold.\n\nThen Dr. Remedy grew impatient, and bade flay a dog.\n\n\"A dog is next best to an ape; only it must be a dog all of one colour.\"\n\nSo they flayed a liver-coloured dog, and clapped it, yet palpitating, to\ntheir sovereign's breast and he died.\n\nPhilip the Good, thus scientifically disposed of, left thirty-one\nchildren: of whom one, somehow or another, was legitimate; and reigned\nin his stead.\n\nThe good duke provided for nineteen out of the other thirty; the rest\nshifted for themselves.\n\nAccording to the Flemish chronicle the deceased prince was descended\nfrom the kings of Troy through Thierry of Aquitaine, and Chilperic,\nPharamond, etc., the old kings of Franconia.\n\nBut this in reality was no distinction. Not a prince of his day have\nI been able to discover who did not come down from Troy. \"Priam\" was\nmediaeval for \"Adam.\"\n\nThe good duke's, body was carried into Burgundy, and laid in a noble\nmausoleum of black marble at Dijon.\n\nHolland rang with his death; and little dreamed that anything as\nfamous was born in her territory that year. That judgment has been long\nreversed. Men gaze at the tailor's house, here the great birth of the\nfifteenth century took place. In what house the good duke died \"no one\nknows and no one cares,\" as the song says.\n\nAnd why?\n\nDukes Philip the Good come and go, and leave mankind not a halfpenny\nwiser, nor better, nor other than they found it.\n\nBut when, once in three hundred years, such a child is born to the world\nas Margaret's son, lo! a human torch lighted by fire from heaven; and\n\"FIAT LUX\" thunder's from pole to pole.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXII\n\nThe Cloister\n\nThe Dominicans, or preaching friars, once the most powerful order in\nEurope, were now on the wane; their rivals and bitter enemies, the\nFranciscans, were overpowering them throughout Europe; even in England,\na rich and religious country, where under the name of the Black Friars,\nthey had once been paramount.\n\nTherefore the sagacious men, who watched and directed the interests of\nthe order, were never so anxious to incorporate able and zealous sons\nand send them forth to win back the world.\n\nThe zeal and accomplishments of Clement, especially his rare mastery of\nlanguage (for he spoke Latin, Italian, French, high and low Dutch),\nsoon transpired, and he was destined to travel and preach in England,\ncorresponding with the Roman centre.\n\nBut Jerome, who had the superior's ear, obstructed this design.\n\n\"Clement,\" said he, \"has the milk of the world still in his veins, its\nfeelings, its weaknesses let not his new-born zeal and his humility\ntempt us to forego our ancient wisdom. Try him first, and temper him,\nlest one day we find ourselves leaning on a reed for a staff.\n\n\"It is well advised,\" said the prior. \"Take him in hand thyself.\"\n\nThen Jerome, following the ancient wisdom, took Clement and tried him.\n\nOne day he brought him to a field where the young men amused themselves\nat the games of the day; he knew this to be a haunt of Clement's late\nfriends.\n\nAnd sure enough ere long Pietro Vanucci and Andrea passed by them, and\ncast a careless glance on the two friars. They did not recognize their\ndead friend in a shaven monk.\n\nClement gave a very little start, and then lowered his eyes and said a\npaternoster.\n\n\"Would ye not speak with them, brother?\" said Jerome, trying him.\n\n\"No brother: yet was it good for me to see them. They remind me of the\nsins I can never repent enough.\"\n\n\"It is well,\" said Jerome, and he made a cold report in Clement's\nfavour.\n\nThen Jerome took Clement to many death-beds. And then into noisome\ndungeons; places where the darkness was appalling, and the stench\nloathsome, pestilential; and men looking like wild beasts lay coiled\nin rags and filth and despair. It tried his body hard; but the soul\ncollected all its powers to comfort such poor wretches there as were\nnot past comfort. And Clement shone in that trial. Jerome reported that\nClement's spirit was willing, but his flesh was weak.\n\n\"Good!\" said Anselm; \"his flesh is weak, but his spirit is willing.\"\n\nBut there was a greater trial in store.\n\nI will describe it as it was seen by others.\n\nOne morning a principal street in Rome was crowded, and even the avenues\nblocked up with heads. It was an execution. No common crime had been\ndone, and on no vulgar victim.\n\nThe governor of Rome had been found in his bed at daybreak, slaughtered.\nHis hand, raised probably in self-defence, lay by his side severed at\nthe wrist; his throat was cut, and his temples bruised with some blunt\ninstrument. The murder had been traced to his servant, and was to be\nexpiated in kind this very morning.\n\nItalian executions were not cruel in general. But this murder was\nthought to call for exact and bloody retribution.\n\nThe criminal was brought to the house of the murdered man and fastened\nfor half an hour to its wall. After this foretaste of legal vengeance\nhis left hand was struck off, like his victim's. A new-killed fowl was\ncut open and fastened round the bleeding stump; with what view I really\ndon't know; but by the look of it, some mare's nest of the poor dear\ndoctors; and the murderer, thus mutilated and bandaged, was hurried to\nthe scaffold; and there a young friar was most earnest and affectionate\nin praying with him, and for him, and holding the crucifix close to his\neyes.\n\nPresently the executioner pulled the friar roughly on one side, and in\na moment felled the culprit with a heavy mallet, and falling on him, cut\nhis throat from ear to ear.\n\nThere was a cry of horror from the crowd.\n\nThe young friar swooned away.\n\nA gigantic monk strode forward, and carried him off like a child.\n\nBrother Clement went back to the convent sadly discouraged. He confessed\nto the prior, with tears of regret.\n\n\"Courage, son Clement,\" said the prior. \"A Dominican is not made in\na day. Thou shalt have another trial. And I forbid thee to go to it\nfasting.\" Clement bowed his head in token of obedience. He had not long\nto wait. A robber was brought to the scaffold; a monster of villainy\nand cruelty, who had killed men in pure wantonness, after robbing them.\nClement passed his last night in prison with him, accompanied him to\nthe scaffold, and then prayed with him and for him so earnestly that the\nhardened ruffian shed tears and embraced him Clement embraced him\ntoo, though his flesh quivered with repugnance; and held the crucifix\nearnestly before his eyes. The man was garotted, and Clement lost sight\nof the crowd, and prayed loud and earnestly while that dark spirit was\npassing from earth. He was no sooner dead than the hangman raised his\nhatchet and quartered the body on the spot. And, oh, mysterious heart\nof man! the people who had seen the living body robbed of life with\nindifference, almost with satisfaction, uttered a piteous cry at each\nstroke of the axe upon his corpse that could feel nought. Clement too\nshuddered then, but stood firm, like one of those rocks that vibrate but\ncannot be thrown down. But suddenly Jerome's voice sounded in his ear.\n\n\"Brother Clement, get thee on that cart and preach to the people. Nay,\nquickly! strike with all thy force on all this iron, while yet 'tis hot,\nand souls are to be saved.\"\n\nClement's colour came and went; and he breathed hard. But he obeyed, and\nwith ill-assured step mounted the cart, and preached his first sermon\nto the first crowd he had ever faced. Oh, that sea of heads! His throat\nseemed parched, his heart thumped, his voice trembled.\n\nBy-and-by the greatness of the occasion, the sight of the eager upturned\nfaces, and his own heart full of zeal, fired the pale monk. He told them\nthis robber's history, warm from his own lips in the prison, and showed\nhis hearers by that example the gradations of folly and crime, and\nwarned them solemnly not to put foot on the first round of that fatal\nladder. And as alternately he thundered against the shedders of blood,\nand moved the crowd to charity and pity, his tremors left him, and he\nfelt all strung up like a lute, and gifted with an unsuspected force; he\nwas master of that listening crowd, could feel their very pulse,\ncould play sacred melodies on them as on his psaltery. Sobs and groans\nattested his power over the mob already excited by the tragedy before\nthem. Jerome stared like one who goes to light a stick; and fires a\nrocket. After a while Clement caught his look of astonishment, and\nseeing no approbation in it, broke suddenly off, and joined him.\n\n\"It was my first endeavour,\" said he apologetically. \"Your behest came\non me like a thunderbolt. Was I?--Did I?--Oh, correct me, and aid me\nwith your experience, Brother Jerome.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" said Jerome doubtfully. He added, rather sullenly after long\nreflection, \"Give the glory to God, Brother Clement; my opinion is thou\nart an orator born.\"\n\nHe reported the same at headquarters, half reluctantly. For he was an\nhonest friar though a disagreeable one.\n\nOne Julio Antonelli was accused of sacrilege; three witnesses swore they\nsaw him come out of the church whence the candle-sticks were stolen, and\nat the very time. Other witnesses proved an alibi for him as positively.\nNeither testimony could be shaken. In this doubt Antonelli was permitted\nthe trial by water, hot or cold. By the hot trial he must put his bare\narm into boiling water, fourteen inches deep, and take out a pebble; by\nthe cold trial his body must be let down into eight feet of water.\nThe clergy, who thought him innocent, recommended the hot water trial,\nwhich, to those whom they favoured, was not so terrible as it sounded.\nBut the poor wretch had not the nerve, and chose the cold ordeal. And\nthis gave Jerome another opportunity of steeling Clement. Antonelli took\nthe sacrament, and then was stripped naked on the banks of the Tiber,\nand tied hand and foot, to prevent those struggles by which a man,\nthrowing his arms out of the water, sinks his body.\n\nHe was then let down gently into the stream, and floated a moment, with\njust his hair above water. A simultaneous roar from the crowd on\neach bank proclaimed him guilty. But the next moment the ropes,\nwhich happened to be new, got wet, and he settled down. Another roar\nproclaimed his innocence. They left him at the bottom of the river\nthe appointed time, rather more than half a minute, then drew him up,\ngurgling and gasping, and screaming for mercy; and after the appointed\nprayers, dismissed him, cleared of the charge.\n\nDuring the experiment Clement prayed earnestly on the bank.\n\nWhen it was over he thanked God in a loud but slightly quavering voice.\n\nBy-and-by he asked Jerome whether the man ought not to be compensated.\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"For the pain, the dread, the suffocation. Poor soul, he liveth, but\nhath tasted all the bitterness of death. Yet he had done no ill.\"\n\n\"He is rewarded enough in that he is cleared of his fault.\"\n\n\"But being innocent of that fault, yet hath he drunk Death's cup, though\nnot to the dregs; and his accusers, less innocent than he, do suffer\nnought.\"\n\nJerome replied somewhat sternly--\n\n\"It is not in this world men are really punished, Brother Clement.\nUnhappy they who sin yet suffer not. And happy they who suffer such ills\nas earth hath power to inflict; 'tis counted to them above, ay, and a\nhundred-fold.\"\n\nClement bowed his head submissively.\n\n\"May thy good words not fall to the ground, but take root in my heart,\nBrother Jerome.\"\n\nBut the severest trial Clement underwent at Jerome's hands was\nunpremeditated. It came about thus. Jerome, in an indulgent moment, went\nwith him to Fra Colonna, and there \"The Dream of Polifilo\" lay on the\ntable just copied fairly. The poor author, in the pride of his heart,\npointed out a master-stroke in it.\n\n\"For ages,\" said he, \"fools have been lavishing poetic praise and\namorous compliment on mortal women, mere creatures of earth, smacking\npalpably of their origin; Sirens at the windows, where our Roman women\nin particular have by lifelong study learned the wily art to show their\none good feature, though but an ear or an eyelash, at a jalosy, and\nhide all the rest; Magpies at the door, Capre n' i giardini, Angeli in\nStrada, Sante in chiesa, Diavoli in casa. Then come I and ransack the\nminstrels' lines for amorous turns, not forgetting those which Petrarch\nwasted on that French jilt Laura, the sliest of them all; and I lay you\nthe whole bundle of spice at the feet of the only females worthy amorous\nincense; to wit, the Nine Muses.\"\n\n\"By which goodly stratagem,\" said Jerome, who had been turning the pages\nall this time, \"you, a friar of St. Dominic, have produced an obscene\nbook.\" And he dashed Polifilo on the table.\n\n\"Obscene? thou discourteous monk!\" And the author ran round the table,\nsnatched Polifilo away, locked him up, and trembling with mortification,\nsaid, \"My Gerard, pshaw! Brother What's-his-name had not found Polifilo\nobscene. Puris omnia pura.\"\n\n\"Such as read your Polifilo--Heaven grant they may be few--will find him\nwhat I find him.\"\n\nPoor Colonna gulped down this bitter pill as he might; and had he\nnot been in his own lodgings, and a high-born gentleman as well as a\nscholar, there might have been a vulgar quarrel.\n\nAs it was, he made a great effort, and turned the conversation to\na beautiful chrysolite the Cardinal Colonna had lent him; and while\nClement handled it, enlarged on its moral virtues: for he went the whole\nlength of his age as a worshipper of jewels.\n\nBut Jerome did not, and expostulated with him for believing that one\ndead stone could confer valour on its wearer, another chastity, another\nsafety from poison, another temperance.\n\n\"The experience of ages proves they do,\" said Colonna. \"As to the last\nvirtue you have named, there sits a living proof. This Gerard--I beg\npardon, Brother Thingemy--comes from the north, where men drink like\nfishes; yet was he ever most abstemious. And why? Carried an amethyst,\nthe clearest and fullest coloured e'er I saw on any but noble finger.\nWhere, in Heaven's name, is thine amethyst? Show it this unbeliever!\"\n\n\"And 'twas that amethyst made the boy temperate?\" asked Jerome\nironically.\n\n\"Certainly. Why, what is the derivation and meaning of amethyst? {a}\nnegative, and {methua} to tipple. Go to, names are but the signs of\nthings. A stone is not called {amethustos} for two thousand years out of\nmere sport, and abuse of language.\"\n\nHe then went through the prime jewels, illustrating their moral\nproperties, especially of the ruby, the sapphire, the emerald, and the\nopal, by anecdotes out of grave historians.\n\n\"These be old wives' fables,\" said Jerome contemptuously. \"Was ever such\ncredulity as thine?\"\n\nNow credulity is a reproach sceptics have often the ill-luck to incur;\nbut it mortifies them none the less for that.\n\nThe believer in stones writhed under it, and dropped the subject. Then\nJerome, mistaking his silence, exhorted him to go a step farther, and\ngive up from this day his vain pagan lore, and study the lives of the\nsaints. \"Blot out these heathen superstitions from thy mind, brother, as\nChristianity hath blotted them from the earth.\"\n\nAnd in this strain he proceeded, repeating, incautiously, some current\nbut loose theological statements. Then the smarting Polifilo revenged\nhimself. He flew out, and hurled a mountain of crude, miscellaneous\nlore upon Jerome, of which, partly for want of time, partly for lack of\nlearning, I can reproduce but a few fragments.\n\n\"The heathen blotted out? Why, they hold four-fifths of the world. And\nwhat have we Christians invented without their aid? painting? sculpture?\nthese are heathen arts, and we but pigmies at them. What modern mind\ncan conceive and grave so god-like forms as did the chief Athenian\nsculptors, and the Libyan Licas, and Dinocrates of Macedon, and Scopas,\nTimotheus, Leochares, and Briaxis; Chares, Lysippus, and the immortal\nthree of Rhodes, that wrought Laocoon from a single block? What prince\nhath the genius to turn mountains into statues, as was done at Bagistan,\nand projected at Athos? What town the soul to plant a colossus of brass\nin the sea, for the tallest ships to sail in and out between his legs?\nIs it architecture we have invented? Why, here too we are but children.\nCan we match for pure design the Parthenon, with its clusters of double\nand single Doric columns? (I do adore the Doric when the scale is\nlarge), and for grandeur and finish, the theatres of Greece and Rome,\nor the prodigious temples of Egypt, up to whose portals men walked\nawe-struck through avenues a mile long of sphinxes, each as big as a\nVenetian palace. And all these prodigies of porphyry cut and polished\nlike crystal, not rough hewn as in our puny structures. Even now their\npolished columns and pilasters lie o'erthrown and broken, o'ergrown with\nacanthus and myrtle, but sparkling still, and flouting the slovenly art\nof modern workmen. Is it sewers, aqueducts, viaducts?\n\n\"Why, we have lost the art of making a road--lost it with the world's\ngreatest models under our very eye. Is it sepulchres of the dead? Why,\nno Christian nation has ever erected a tomb, the sight of which does not\nset a scholar laughing. Do but think of the Mausoleum, and the Pyramids,\nand the monstrous sepulchres of the Indus and Ganges, which outside are\nmountains, and within are mines of precious stones. Ah, you have not\nseen the East, Jerome, or you could not decry the heathen.\"\n\nJerome observed that these were mere material things. True greatness was\nin the soul.\n\n\"Well then,\" replied Colonna, \"in the world of mind, what have we\ndiscovered? Is it geometry? Is it logic? Nay, we are all pupils of\nEuclid and Aristotle. Is it written characters, an invention almost\ndivine? We no more invented it than Cadmus did. Is it poetry? Homer hath\nnever been approached by us, nor hath Virgil, nor Horace. Is it tragedy\nor comedy? Why, poets, actors, theatres, all fell to dust at our\ntouch. Have we succeeded in reviving them? Would you compare our little\nmiserable mysteries and moralities, all frigid personification, and dog\nLatin, with the glories of a Greek play (on the decoration of which\na hundred thousand crowns had been spent) performed inside a marble\nmiracle, the audience a seated city, and the poet a Sophocles?\n\n\"What then have we invented? Is it monotheism? Why, the learned and\nphilosophical among the Greeks and Romans held it; even their more\nenlightened poets were monotheists in their sleeves.\n\n     {Zeus estin ouranos, Zeus te gy Zeus toi panta}\n     saith the Greek, and Lucan echoes him:\n     'Jupiter est quod cunque vides quo cunque moveris.'\n\n\"Their vulgar were polytheists; and what are ours? We have not invented\n'invocation of the saints.' Our sancti answers to their Daemones and\nDivi, and the heathen used to pray their Divi or deified mortal to\nintercede with the higher divinity; but the ruder minds among them,\nincapable of nice distinctions, worshipped those lesser gods they should\nhave but invoked. And so do the mob of Christians in our day, following\nthe heathen vulgar or by unbroken tradition. For in holy writ is no\npolytheism of any sort or kind.\n\n\"We have not invented so much as a form or variety of polytheism. The\npagan vulgar worshipped all sorts of deified mortals, and each had his\nfavourite, to whom he prayed ten times for once to the Omnipotent. Our\nvulgar worship canonized mortals, and each has his favourite, to whom he\nprays ten times for once to God. Call you that invention? Invention is\nconfined to the East. Among the ancient vulgar only the mariners were\nmonotheists; they worshipped Venus; called her 'Stella maris,' and\n'Regina caelorum.' Among our vulgar only the mariners are monotheists;\nthey worship the Virgin Mary, and call her the 'Star of the Sea,' and\nthe 'Queen of Heaven.' Call you theirs a new religion? An old doubtlet\nwith a new button. Our vulgar make images, and adore them, which is\nabsurd; for adoration is the homage due from a creature to its creator;\nnow here man is the creator; so the statues ought to worship him, and\nwould, if they had brains enough to justify a rat in worshipping them.\nBut even this abuse, though childish enough to be modern, is ancient.\nThe pagan vulgar in these parts made their images, then knelt before\nthem, adorned them with flowers, offered incense to them, lighted tapers\nbefore them, carried them in procession, and made pilgrimages to them\njust to the smallest tittle as we their imitators do.\"\n\nJerome here broke in impatiently, and reminded him that the images the\nmost revered in Christendom were made by no mortal hand, but had dropped\nfrom heaven.\n\n\"Ay,\" cried Colonna, \"such are the tutelary images of most great Italian\ntowns. I have examined nineteen of them, and made drafts of them. If\nthey came from the sky, our worst sculptors are our angels. But my mind\nis easy on that score. Ungainly statue or villainous daub fell never yet\nfrom heaven to smuggle the bread out of capable workmen's mouths. All\nthis is Pagan, and arose thus. The Trojans had Oriental imaginations,\nand feigned that their Palladium, a wooden statue three cubits long,\nfell down from heaven. The Greeks took this fib home among the spoils\nof Troy, and soon it rained statues on all the Grecian cities, and their\nLatin apes. And one of these Palladia gave St. Paul trouble at Ephesus;\n'twas a statue of Diana that fell down from Jupiter: credat qui credere\npossit.\"\n\n\"What, would you cast your profane doubts on that picture of our blessed\nLady, which scarce a century agone hung lustrous in the air over this\nvery city, and was taken down by the Pope and bestowed in St. Peter's\nChurch?\"\n\n\"I have no profane doubts on the matter, Jerome. This is the story of\nNuma's shield, revived by theologians with an itch for fiction, but no\ntalent that way; not being orientals. The 'ancile' or sacred shield\nof Numa hung lustrous in the air over this very city, till that pious\nprince took it down and hung it in the temple of Jupiter. Be just,\nswallow both stories or neither. The 'Bocca della Verita' passes for a\nstatue of the Virgin, and convicted a woman of perjury the other day;\nit is in reality an image of the goddess Rhea, and the modern figment is\none of its ancient traditions; swallow both or neither.\n\n'Qui Bavium non odit amet tua carmina, Mavi.'\n\n\"But indeed we owe all our Palladiuncula, and all our speaking, nodding,\nwinking, sweating, bleeding statues, to these poor abused heathens; the\nAthenian statues all sweated before the battle of Chaeronea, so did the\nRoman statues during Tully's consulship, viz., the statue of Victory at\nCapua, of Mars at Rome, and of Apollo outside the gates. The Palladium\nitself was brought to Italy by Aeneas, and after keeping quiet three\ncenturies, made an observation in Vesta's Temple: a trivial one, I fear,\nsince it hath not survived; Juno's statue at Veii assented with a nod to\ngo to Rome. Antony's statue on Mount Alban bled from every vein in its\nmarble before the fight of Actium. Others cured diseases: as that of\nPelichus, derided by Lucian; for the wiser among the heathen believed in\nsweating marble, weeping wood, and bleeding brass--as I do. Of all our\nmarks and dents made in stone by soft substances, this saint's knee, and\nthat saint's finger, and t'other's head, the original is heathen. Thus\nthe footprints of Hercules were shown on a rock in Scythia. Castor and\nPollux fighting on white horses for Rome against the Latians, left the\nprints of their hoofs on a rock at Regillum. A temple was built to them\non the spot, and the marks were to be seen in Tully's day. You may see,\nnear Venice, a great stone cut nearly in half by St. George's sword.\nThis he ne'er had done but for the old Roman who cut the whetstone in\ntwo with his razor.\n\n'Qui Bavium non odit amet tua carmina, Mavi.'\n\n\"Kissing of images, and the Pope's toe, is Eastern Paganism. The\nEgyptians had it of the Assyrians, the Greeks of the Egyptians, the\nRomans of the Greeks, and we of the Romans, whose Pontifex Maximus had\nhis toe kissed under the Empire. The Druids kissed the High Priest's toe\na thousand years B.C. The Mussulmans, who, like you, profess to abhor\nHeathenism, kiss the stone of the Caaba: a Pagan practice.\n\n\"The Priests of Baal kissed their idols so.\n\n\"Tully tells us of a fair image of Hercules at Agrigentum, whose chin\nwas worn by kissing. The lower parts of the statue we call Peter are\nJupiter. The toe is sore worn, but not all by Christian mouths. The\nheathen vulgar laid their lips there first, for many a year, and ours\nhave but followed them, as monkeys their masters. And that is why, down\nwith the poor heathen!\n\nPereant qui ante nos nostra fecerint.\n\n\"Our infant baptism is Persian, with the font and the signing of the\nchild's brow. Our throwing three handfuls of earth on the coffin, and\nsaying dust to dust, is Egyptian.\n\n\"Our incense is Oriental, Roman, Pagan; and the early Fathers of the\nChurch regarded it with superstitious horror, and died for refusing to\nhandle it. Our Holy water is Pagan, and all its uses. See, here is a\nPagan aspersorium. Could you tell it from one of ours? It stood in the\nsame part of their temples, and was used in ordinary worship as ours,\nand in extraordinary purifications. They called it Aqua lustralis. Their\nvulgar, like ours, thought drops of it falling on the body would wash\nout sin; and their men of sense, like ours, smiled or sighed at such\ncredulity. What saith Ovid of this folly, which hath outlived him?\n\n     'Ah nimium faciles, qui tristia crimina coedis\n     Fluminea tolli posse putetis aqua.'\n\nThou seest the heathen were not all fools. No more are we. Not all.\"\n\nFra Colonna uttered all this with such volubility, that his hearers\ncould not edge in a word of remonstrance; and not being interrupted\nin praising his favourites, he recovered his good humour, without any\ndiminution of his volubility.\n\n\"We celebrate the miraculous Conception of the Virgin on the 2nd of\nFebruary. The old Romans celebrated the Miraculous Conception of Juno on\nthe 2nd of February. Our feast of All Saints is on the 2nd November. The\nFestum Dei Mortis was on the 2nd November. Our Candlemas is also an old\nRoman feast; neither the date nor the ceremony altered one tittle.\nThe patrician ladies carried candles about the city that night as our\nsignoras do now. At the gate of San Croce our courtesans keep a feast\non the 20th August. Ask them why! The little noodles cannot tell you. On\nthat very spot stood the Temple of Venus. Her building is gone; but her\nrite remains. Did we discover Purgatory? On the contrary, all we really\nknow about it is from two treatises of Plato, the Gorgias and the\nPhaedo, and the sixth book of Virgil's Aeneid.\n\n\"I take it from a holier source: St. Gregory,\" said Jerome sternly.\n\n\"Like enough,\" replied Colonna drily. \"But St. Gregory was not so nice;\nhe took it from Virgil. Some souls, saith Gregory, are purged by fire,\nothers by water, others by air.\n\n\"Says Virgil--\n\n     'Aliae panduntur inanes,\n     Suspensae ad ventous, aliis sub gurgite vasto\n     Infectum eluitur scelus, aut exuritur igni.'\n\nBut peradventure, you think Pope Gregory I lived before Virgil, and\nVirgil versified him.\n\n\"But the doctrine is Eastern, and as much older than Plato as Plato\nthan Gregory. Our prayers for the dead came from Asia with Aeneas. Ovid\ntells, that when he prayed for the soul of Anchises, the custom was\nstrange in Italy.\n\n     'Hunc morem Aeneas, pietatis idoneus auctor\n     Attulit in terras, juste Latine, tuas.'\n\nThe 'Biblicae' Sortes,' which I have seen consulted on the altar, are\na parody on the 'Sortes Virgilianae.' Our numerous altars in one church\nare heathen: the Jews, who are monotheists, have but one altar in a\nchurch. But the Pagans had many, being polytheists. In the temple of\nPathian Venus were a hundred of them. 'Centum que Sabaeo thure calent\narae.' Our altar's and our hundred lights around St. Peter's tomb are\nPagan. 'Centum aras posuit vigilemque sacraverat ignem.' We invent\nnothing, not even numerically. Our very Devil is the god Pan, horns and\nhoofs and all; but blackened. For we cannot draw; we can but daub the\nfigures of Antiquity with a little sorry paint or soot. Our Moses hath\nstolen the horns of Ammon; our Wolfgang the hook of Saturn; and Janus\nbore the keys of heaven before St. Peter. All our really old Italian\nbronzes of the Virgin and Child are Venuses and Cupids. So is the wooden\nstatue, that stands hard by this house, of Pope Joan and the child\nshe is said to have brought forth there in the middle of a procession.\nIdiots! are new-born children thirteen years old? And that boy is not a\nday younger. Cupid! Cupid! Cupid! And since you accuse me of credulity,\nknow that to my mind that Papess is full as mythological, born of froth,\nand every way unreal, as the goddess who passes for her in the next\nstreet, or as the saints you call St. Baccho and St. Quirina: or St.\nOracte, which is a dunce-like corruption of Mount Soracte, or St.\nAmphibolus, an English saint, which is a dunce-like corruption of the\ncloak worn by their St. Alban, Or as the Spanish saint, St. Viar: which\nwords on his tombstone, written thus, 'S. Viar,' prove him no saint,\nbut a good old nameless heathen, and 'praefectus Viarum,' or overseer\nof roads (would he were back to earth, and paganizing of our Christian\nroads!), or as our St. Veronica of Benasco, which Veronica is a\ndunce-like corruption of the 'Vera icon,' which this saint brought\ninto the church. I wish it may not be as unreal as the donor, Or as the\neleven thousand virgins of Cologne, who were but a couple.\"\n\nClement interrupted him to inquire what he meant. \"I have spoken with\nthose have seen their bones.\"\n\n\"What, of eleven thousand virgins all collected in one place and at one\ntime? Do but bethink thee, Clement. Not one of the great Eastern cities\nof antiquity could collect eleven thousand Pagan virgins at one time,\nfar less a puny Western city. Eleven thousand Christian virgins in a\nlittle, wee, Paynim city!\n\n'Quod cunque ostendis mihi sic incredulus odi.'\n\nThe simple sooth is this. The martyrs were two: the Breton princess\nherself, falsely called British, and her maid, Onesimilla, which is\na Greek name, Onesima, diminished. This some fool did mis-pronounce\nundecim mille, eleven thousand: loose tongue found credulous ears, and\nso one fool made many; eleven thousand of them, an' you will. And you\ncharge me with credulity, Jerome? and bid me read the Lives of the\nSaints. Well, I have read them, and many a dear old Pagan acquaintance\nI found there. The best fictions in the book are Oriental, and are known\nto have been current in Persia and Arabia eight hundred years and more\nbefore the dates the Church assigns to them as facts. As for the true\nWestern figments, they lack the Oriental plausibility. Think you I am\ncredulous enough to believe that St. Ida joined a decapitated head to\nits body? that Cuthbert's carcass directed his bearers where to go, and\nwhere to stop; that a city was eaten up of rats to punish one Hatto\nfor comparing the poor to mice; that angels have a little horn in\ntheir foreheads, and that this was seen and recorded at the time by\nSt. Veronica of Benasco, who never existed, and hath left us this\ninformation and a miraculous handkercher? For my part, I think the\nholiest woman the world ere saw must have an existence ere she can have\na handkercher or an eye to take unicorns for angels. Think you I believe\nthat a brace of lions turned sextons and helped Anthony bury Paul of\nThebes? that Patrick, a Scotch saint, stuck a goat's beard on all the\ndescendants of one that offended him? that certain thieves, having\nstolen the convent ram, and denying it, St. Pol de Leon bade the ram\nbear witness, and straight the mutton bleated in the thief's belly?\nWould you have me give up the skilful figments of antiquity for such old\nwives' fables as these? The ancients lied about animals, too; but then\nthey lied logically; we unreasonably. Do but compare Ephis and his\nlion, or, better still, Androcles and his lion, with Anthony and his two\nlions. Both the Pagan lions do what lions never did' but at the least\nthey act in character. A lion with a bone in his throat, or a thorn\nin his foot, could not do better than be civil to a man. But Anthony's\nlions are asses in a lion's skin. What leonine motive could they have in\nturning sextons? A lion's business is to make corpses, not inter them.\"\nHe added, with a sigh, \"Our lies are as inferior to the lies of the\nancients as our statues, and for the same reason; we do not study nature\nas they did. We are imitatores, servum pecus. Believe you 'the lives of\nthe saints;' that Paul the Theban was the first hermit, and Anthony the\nfirst Caenobite? Why, Pythagoras was an Eremite, and under ground for\nseven years; and his daughter was an abbess. Monks and hermits were in\nthe East long before Moses, and neither old Greece nor Rome was ever\nwithout them. As for St. Francis and his snowballs, he did but mimic\nDiogenes, who, naked, embraced statues on which snow had fallen. The\nfolly without the poetry. Ape of an ape--for Diogenes was but a mimic\ntherein of the Brahmins and Indian gymnosophists. Natheless, the\nchildren of this Francis bid fair to pelt us out of the Church with\ntheir snowballs. Tell me now, Clement, what habit is lovelier than\nthe vestments of our priests? Well, we owe them all to Numa Pompilius,\nexcept the girdle and the stole, which are judaical. As for the amice\nand the albe, they retain the very names they bore in Numa's day. The\n'pelt' worn by the canons comes from primeval Paganism. 'Tis a relic\nof those rude times when the sacrificing priest wore the skins of the\nbeasts with the fur outward. Strip off thy black gown, Jerome, thy\ngirdle and cowl, for they come to us all three from the Pagan ladies.\nLet thy hair grow like Absolom's, Jerome! for the tonsure is as Pagan as\nthe Muses.\"\n\n\"Take care what thou sayest,\" said Jerome sternly. \"We know the very\nyear in which the Church did first ordain it.\"\n\n\"But not invent it, Jerome. The Brahmins wore it a few thousands years\nere that. From them it came through the Assyrians to the priests of Isis\nin Egypt, and afterwards of Serapis at Athens. The late Pope (the saints\nbe good to him) once told me the tonsure was forbidden by God to the\nLevites in the Pentateuch. If so, this was because of the Egyptian\npriests wearing it. I trust to his holiness. I am no biblical scholar.\nThe Latin of thy namesake Jerome is a barrier I cannot overleap. 'Dixit\nad me Dominus Dens. Dixi ad Dominum Deum.' No, thank you, holy Jerome;\nI can stand a good deal, but I cannot stand thy Latin. Nay; give me the\nNew Testament! 'Tis not the Greek of Xenophon; but 'tis Greek. And there\nbe heathen sayings in it too. For St. Paul was not so spiteful against\nthem as thou. When the heathen said a good thing that suited his matter,\nby Jupiter he just took it, and mixed it to all eternity with the\ninspired text.\"\n\n\"Come forth, Clement, come forth!\" said Jerome, rising; \"and thou,\nprofane monk, know that but for the powerful house that upholds thee,\nthy accursed heresy should go no farther, for I would have thee burned\nat the stake.\" And he strode out white with indignation.\n\nColonna's reception of this threat did credit to him as an enthusiast.\nHe ran and hallooed joyfully after Jerome. \"And that is Pagan. Burning\nof men's bodies for the opinions of their souls is a purely Pagan\ncustom--as Pagan as incense, holy water, a hundred altars in one church,\nthe tonsure, the cardinal's, or flamen's hat, the word Pope, the--\"\n\nHere Jerome slammed the door.\n\nBut ere they could get clear of the house a jalosy was flung open, and\nthe Paynim monk came out head and shoulders, and overhung the street\nshouting,\n\n     \"Affecti suppliciis Chrisitiani, genus hominum\n     Novas superstitionis ac maleficae,'\"\n\nAnd having delivered this parting blow, he felt a great triumphant joy,\nand strode exultant to and fro; and not attending with his usual care\nto the fair way (for his room could only be threaded by little paths\nwriggling among the antiquities), tripped over the beak of an Egyptian\nstork, and rolled upon a regiment of Armenian gods, which he found tough\nin argument though small in stature.\n\n\"You will go no more to that heretical monk,\" said Jerome to Clement.\n\nClement sighed. \"Shall we leave him and not try to correct him? Make\nallowance for heat of discourse! he was nettled, His words are worse\nthan his acts. Oh 'tis a pure and charitable soul.\"\n\n\"So are all arch-heretics. Satan does not tempt them like other men.\nRather he makes them more moral, to give their teaching weight. Fra\nColonna cannot be corrected; his family is all-powerful in Rome, Pray we\nthe saints he blasphemes to enlighten him, 'Twill not be the first time\nthey have returned good for evil, Meantime thou art forbidden to consort\nwith him, From this day go alone through the city! Confess and absolve\nsinners! exorcise demons! comfort the sick! terrify the impenitent!\npreach wherever men are gathered and occasion serves! and hold no\nconverse with the Fra Colonna!\"\n\nClement bowed his head.\n\nThen the prior, at Jerome's request, had the young friar watched. And\none day the spy returned with the news that Brother Clement had passed\nby the Fra Colonna's lodging, and had stopped a little while in the\nstreet, and then gone on, but with his hand to his eyes and slowly.\n\nThis report Jerome took to the prior. The prior asked his opinion,\nand also Anselm's, who was then taking leave of him on his return to\nJuliers.\n\nJerome. \"Humph! He obeyed, but with regret, ay, with childish repining.\"\n\nAnselm, \"He shed a natural tear at turning his back on a friend and a\nbenefactor, But he obeyed.\"\n\nNow Anselm was one of your gentle irresistibles, He had at times a mild\nascendant even over Jerome.\n\n\"Worthy Brother Anselm,\" said Jerome, \"Clement is weak to the very\nbone, He will disappoint thee, He will do nothing, great, either for the\nChurch or for our holy order. Yet he is an orator, and hath drunken of\nthe spirit of St. Dominic. Fly him, then, with a string.\"\n\nThat same day it was announced to Clement that he was to go to England\nimmediately with Brother Jerome.\n\nClement folded his hands on his breast, and bowed his head in calm\nsubmission.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIII\n\nTHE HEARTH\n\nA Catherine is not an unmixed good in a strange house. The governing\npower is strong in her. She has scarce crossed the threshold ere the\nutensils seem to brighten; the hearth to sweep itself; the windows to\nlet in more light; and the soul of an enormous cricket to animate\nthe dwelling-place. But this cricket is a Busy Body. And that is a\ntremendous character. It has no discrimination. It sets everything to\nrights, and everybody. Now many things are the better for being set to\nrights. But everything is not. Everything is the one thing that won't\nstand being set to rights; except in that calm and cool retreat, the\ngrave.\n\nCatherine altered the position of every chair and table in Margaret's\nhouse; and perhaps for the better.\n\nBut she must go farther, and upset the live furniture.\n\nWhen Margaret's time was close at hand, Catherine treacherously invited\nthe aid of Denys and Martin; and on the poor, simple-minded fellows\nasking her earnestly what service they could be, she told them they\nmight make themselves comparatively useful by going for a little walk.\nSo far so good. But she intimated further that should the promenade\nextend into the middle of next week all the better. This was not\ningratiating. The subsequent conduct of the strong under the yoke of the\nweak might have propitiated a she-bear with three cubs, one sickly.\nThey generally slipped out of the house at daybreak; and stole in like\nthieves at night; and if by any chance they were at home, they went\nabout like cats on a wall tipped with broken glass, and wearing\nawe-struck visages, and a general air of subjugation and depression.\n\nBut all would not do. Their very presence was ill-timed; and jarred upon\nCatherine's nerves.\n\nDid instinct whisper, a pair of depopulators had no business in a house\nwith multipliers twain?\n\nThe breastplate is no armour against a female tongue; and Catherine ran\ninfinite pins and needles of speech into them. In a word, when Margaret\ncame down stairs, she found the kitchen swept of heroes.\n\nMartin, old and stiff, had retreated no farther than the street, and\nwith the honours of war: for he had carried off his baggage, a stool;\nand sat on it in the air.\n\nMargaret saw he was out in the sun; but was not aware he was a fixture\nin that luminary. She asked for Denys. \"Good, kind Denys; he will be\nright pleased to see me about again.\"\n\nCatherine, wiping a bowl with now superfluous vigour, told her Denys was\ngone to his friends in Burgundy. \"And high time, Hasn't been anigh them\nthis three years, by all accounts.\"\n\n\"What, gone without bidding me farewell?\" said Margaret, uplifting two\ntender eyes like full-blown violets.\n\nCatherine reddened. For this new view of the matter set her conscience\npricking her.\n\nBut she gave a little toss and said, \"Oh, you were asleep at the time:\nand I would not have you wakened.\"\n\n\"Poor Denys,\" said Margaret, and the dew gathered visibly on the open\nviolets.\n\nCatherine saw out of the corner of her eye, and without taking a bit of\nopen notice, slipped off and lavished hospitality and tenderness on the\nsurviving depopulator.\n\nIt was sudden: and Martin old and stiff in more ways than one--\n\n\"No, thank you, dame. I have got used to out o' doors. And I love not\nchanging and changing. I meddle wi' nobody here; and nobody meddles wi'\nme.\"\n\n\"Oh, you nasty, cross old wretch!\" screamed Catherine, passing in a\nmoment from treacle to sharpest vinegar. And she flounced back into the\nhouse.\n\nOn calm reflection she had a little cry. Then she half reconciled\nherself to her conduct by vowing to be so kind, Margaret should never\nmiss her plagues of soldiers. But feeling still a little uneasy, she\ndispersed all regrets by a process at once simple and sovereign.\n\nShe took and washed the child.\n\nFrom head to foot she washed him in tepid water; and heroes, and their\nwrongs, became as dust in an ocean--of soap and water.\n\nWhile this celestial ceremony proceeded, Margaret could not keep quiet.\nShe hovered round the fortunate performer. She must have an apparent\nhand in it, if not a real. She put her finger into the water--to pave\nthe way for her boy, I suppose; for she could not have deceived herself\nso far as to think Catherine would allow her to settle the temperature.\nDuring the ablution she kneeled down opposite the little Gerard, and\nprattled to him with amazing fluency; taking care, however, not to\narticulate like grown-up people; for, how could a cherub understand\ntheir ridiculous pronunciation?\n\n\"I wish you could wash out THAT,\" said she, fixing her eyes on the\nlittle boy's hand.\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"What, have you not noticed? on his little finger.\"\n\nGranny looked, and there was a little brown mole,\n\n\"Eh, but this is wonderful!\" she cried. \"Nature, my lass, y'are strong;\nand meddlesome to boot. Hast noticed such a mark on some one else? Tell\nthe truth, girl!\"\n\n\"What, on him? Nay, mother, not I.\"\n\n\"Well then he has; and on the very spot. And you never noticed that\nmuch. But, dear heart, I forgot; you han't known him from child to man\nas I have, I have had him hundreds o' times on my knees, the same\nas this, and washed him from top to toe in luke-warm water.\" And she\nswelled with conscious superiority; and Margaret looked meekly up to her\nas a woman beyond competition.\n\nCatherine looked down from her dizzy height and moralized. She differed\nfrom other busy-bodies in this, that she now and then reflected: not\ndeeply; or of course I should take care not to print it.\n\n\"It is strange,\" said she, \"how things come round and about, Life is but\na whirligig. Leastways, we poor women, our lives are all cut upon one\npattern. Wasn't I for washing out my Gerard's mole in his young days?\n'Oh, fie! here's a foul blot,' quo' I; and scrubbed away at it I did\ntill I made the poor wight cry; so then I thought 'twas time to give\nover. And now says you to me, 'Mother,' says you, 'do try and wash you\nout o' my Gerard's finger,' says you. Think on't!\"\n\n\"Wash it out?\" cried Margaret; \"I wouldn't for all the world, Why, it is\nthe sweetest bit in his little darling body. I'll kiss it morn and night\ntill he that owned it first comes back to us three, Oh, bless you,\nmy jewel of gold and silver, for being marked like your own daddy, to\ncomfort me.\"\n\nAnd she kissed little Gerard's little mole; but she could not stop\nthere; she presently had him sprawling on her lap, and kissed his\nback all over again and again, and seemed to worry him as wolf a lamb;\nCatherine looking on and smiling. She had seen a good many of these\nsavage onslaughts in her day.\n\nAnd this little sketch indicates the tenor of Margaret's life for\nseveral months, One or two small things occurred to her during that time\nwhich must be told; but I reserve them, since one string will serve for\nmany glass beads. But while her boy's father was passing through those\nfearful tempests of the soul, ending in the dead monastic calm, her life\nmight fairly be summed in one great blissful word--Maternity.\n\nYou, who know what lies in that word, enlarge my little sketch, and see\nthe young mother nursing and washing, and dressing and undressing, and\ncrowing and gambolling with her first-born; then swifter than lightning\ndart your eye into Italy, and see the cold cloister; and the monks\npassing like ghosts, eyes down, hands meekly crossed over bosoms dead to\nearthly feelings.\n\nOne of these cowled ghosts is he, whose return, full of love, and youth,\nand joy, that radiant young mother awaits.\n\n\nIn the valley of Grindelwald the traveller has on one side the\nperpendicular Alps, all rock, ice, and everlasting snow, towering above\nthe clouds, and piercing to the sky; on his other hand little every-day\nslopes, but green as emeralds, and studded with cows and pretty cots,\nand life; whereas those lofty neighbours stand leafless, lifeless,\ninhuman, sublime. Elsewhere sweet commonplaces of nature are apt to pass\nunnoticed; but, fronting the grim Alps, they soothe, and even gently\nstrike, the mind by contrast with their tremendous opposites. Such, in\ntheir way, are the two halves of this story, rightly looked at; on\nthe Italian side rugged adventure, strong passion, blasphemy, vice,\npenitence, pure ice, holy snow, soaring direct at heaven. On the Dutch\nside, all on a humble scale and womanish, but ever green. And as a\npathway parts the ice towers of Grindelwald, aspiring to the sky, from\nits little sunny braes, so here is but a page between\n\n\"the Cloister and the Hearth.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIV\n\nTHE CLOISTER\n\nTHE new pope favoured the Dominican order. The convent received a\nmessage from the Vatican, requiring a capable friar to teach at the\nUniversity of Basle. Now Clement was the very monk for this: well versed\nin languages, and in his worldly days had attended the lectures of\nGuarini the younger. His visit to England was therefore postponed though\nnot resigned; and meantime he was sent to Basle; but not being wanted\nthere for three months, he was to preach on the road.\n\nHe passed out of the northern gate with his eyes lowered, and the whole\nman wrapped in pious contemplation.\n\nOh, if we could paint a mind and its story, what a walking fresco was\nthis barefooted friar!\n\nHopeful, happy love, bereavement, despair, impiety, vice, suicide,\nremorse, religious despondency, penitence, death to the world,\nresignation.\n\nAnd all in twelve short months.\n\nAnd now the traveller was on foot again. But all was changed: no\nperilous adventures now. The very thieves and robbers bowed to the\nground before him, and instead of robbing him, forced stolen money on\nhim, and begged his prayers.\n\nThis journey therefore furnished few picturesque incidents. I have,\nhowever, some readers to think of, who care little for melodrama, and\nexpect a quiet peep at what passes inside a man, To such students things\nundramatic are often vocal, denoting the progress of a mind.\n\nThe first Sunday of Clement's journey was marked by this. He prayed for\nthe soul of Margaret. He had never done so before. Not that her eternal\nwelfare was not dearer to him than anything on earth. It was his\nhumility. The terrible impieties that burst from him on the news of her\ndeath horrified my well-disposed readers; but not as on reflection they\nhorrified him who had uttered them. For a long time during his novitiate\nhe was oppressed with religious despair. He thought he must have\ncommitted that sin against the Holy Spirit which dooms the soul for\never, By degrees that dark cloud cleared away, Anselmo juvante; but\ndeep self-abasement remained. He felt his own salvation insecure, and\nmoreover thought it would be mocking Heaven, should he, the deeply\nstained, pray for a soul so innocent, comparatively, as Margaret's. So\nhe used to coax good Anselm and another kindly monk to pray for her.\nThey did not refuse, nor do it by halves. In general the good old monks\n(and there were good, bad, and indifferent in every convent) had a pure\nand tender affection for their younger brethren, which, in truth, was\nnot of this world.\n\nClement then, having preached on Sunday morning in a small Italian town,\nand being mightily carried onward, was greatly encouraged; and that day\na balmy sense of God's forgiveness and love descended on him. And he\nprayed for the welfare of Margaret's soul. And from that hour this\nbecame his daily habit, and the one purified tie, that by memory\nconnected his heart with earth.\n\nFor his family were to him as if they had never been.\n\nThe Church would not share with earth. Nor could even the Church cure\nthe great love without annihilating the smaller ones.\n\nDuring most of this journey Clement rarely felt any spring of life\nwithin him, but when he was in the pulpit. The other exceptions were,\nwhen he happened to relieve some fellow-creature.\n\nA young man was tarantula bitten, or perhaps, like many more, fancied\nit. Fancy or reality, he had been for two days without sleep, and in\nmost extraordinary convulsions, leaping, twisting, and beating the\nwalls. The village musicians had only excited him worse with their\nmusic. Exhaustion and death followed the disease, when it gained such a\nhead. Clement passed by and learned what was the matter. He sent for a\npsaltery, and tried the patient with soothing melodies; but if the other\ntunes maddened him, Clement's seemed to crush him. He groaned and moaned\nunder them, and grovelled on the floor. At last the friar observed that\nat intervals his lips kept going. He applied his ear, and found the\npatient was whispering a tune; and a very singular one, that had no\nexistence. He learned this tune and played it. The patient's face\nbrightened amazingly. He marched about the room on the light fantastic\ntoe enjoying it; and when Clement's fingers ached nearly off with\nplaying it, he had the satisfaction of seeing the young man sink\ncomplacently to sleep to this lullaby, the strange creation of his own\nmind; for it seems he was no musician, and never composed a tune before\nor after. This sleep saved his life. And Clement, after teaching the\ntune to another, in case it should be wanted again, went forward with\nhis heart a little warmer. On another occasion he found a mob haling\na decently dressed man along, who struggled and vociferated, but in\na strange language. This person had walked into their town erect and\nsprightly, waving a mulberry branch over his head. Thereupon the natives\nfirst gazed stupidly, not believing their eyes, then pounced on him and\ndragged him before the podesta, Clement went with them; but on the way\ndrew quietly near the prisoner and spoke to him in Italian; no answer.\nIn French' German; Dutch; no assets. Then the man tried Clement\nin tolerable Latin, but with a sharpish accent. He said he was an\nEnglishman, and oppressed with the heat of Italy, had taken a bough off\nthe nearest tree, to save his head. \"In my country anybody is welcome to\nwhat grows on the highway. Confound the fools; I am ready to pay for it.\nBut here is all Italy up in arms about a twig and a handful of leaves.\"\n\nThe pig-headed podesta would have sent the dogged islander to prison;\nbut Clement mediated, and with some difficulty made the prisoner\ncomprehend that silkworms, and by consequence mulberry leaves, were\nsacred, being under the wing of the Sovereign, and his source of income;\nand urged on the podesta that ignorance of his mulberry laws was natural\nin a distant country, where the very tree perhaps was unknown, The\nopinionative islander turned the still vibrating scale by pulling' out\na long purse and repeating his original theory, that the whole question\nwas mercantile. \"Quid damni?\" said he, \"Dic; et cito solvam.\" The\npodesta snuffed the gold: fined him a ducat for the duke; about the\nvalue of the whole tree; and pouched the coin.\n\nThe Englishman shook off his ire the moment he was liberated, and\nlaughed heartily at the whole thing; but was very grateful to Clement.\n\n\"You are too good for this hole of a country, father,\" said he, \"Come\nto England! That is the only place in the world, I was an uneasy fool to\nleave it, and wander among mulberries and their idiots. I am a Kentish\nsquire, and educated at Cambridge University. My name it is Rolfe, my\nplace Betshanger, The man and the house are both at your service. Come\nover and stay till domesday. We sit down forty to dinner every day at\nBetshanger. One more or one less at the board will not be seen. You\nshall end your days with me and my heirs if you will, Come now! What an\nEnglishman says he means.\" And he gave him a great hearty grip of the\nhand to confirm it,\n\n\"I will visit thee some day, my son,\" said Clement; \"but not to weary\nthy hospitality.\"\n\nThe Englishman then begged Clement to shrive him. \"I know not what\nwill become of my soul,\" said he, \"I live like a heathen since I left\nEngland.\"\n\nClement consented gladly, and soon the islander was on his knees to him\nby the roadside, confessing the last month's sins.\n\nFinding him so pious a son of the Church, Clement let him know he was\nreally coming to England. He then asked him whether it was true that\ncountry was overrun with Lollards and Wickliffites.\n\nThe other coloured up a little. \"There be black sheep in every land,\"\nsaid he. Then after some reflection he said gravely, \"Holy father, hear\nthe truth about these heretics. None are better disposed towards Holy\nChurch than we English. But we are ourselves, and by ourselves. We love\nour own ways, and above all, our own tongue. The Norman could conquer\nour bill-hooks, but not our tongues; and hard they tried it for many a\nlong year by law and proclamation. Our good foreign priests utter God\nto plain English folk in Latin, or in some French or Italian lingo, like\nthe bleating of a sheep. Then come the fox Wickliff and his crew, and\nread him out of his own book in plain English, that all men's hearts\nwarm to. Who can withstand this? God forgive me, I believe the English\nwould turn deaf ears to St, Peter himself, spoke he not to them in the\ntongue their mothers sowed in their ears and their hearts along with\nmothers' kisses.\" He added hastily, \"I say not this for myself; I am\nCambridge bred; and good words come not amiss to me in Latin; but for\nthe people in general. Clavis ad corda Anglorum est lingua materna.\"\n\n\"My son,\" said Clement, \"blessed be the hour I met thee; for thy words\nare sober and wise. But alas! how shall I learn your English tongue? No\nbook have I.\"\n\n\"I would give you my book of hours, father. 'Tis in English and Latin,\ncheek by jowl. But then, what would become of my poor soul, wanting my\n'hours' in a strange land? Stay, you are a holy man, and I am an honest\none; let us make a bargain; you to pray for me every day for two months,\nand I to give you my book of hours. Here it is. What say you to that?\"\nAnd his eyes sparkled, and he was all on fire with mercantility.\n\nClement smiled gently at this trait; and quietly detached a MS. from his\ngirdle, and showed him that it was in Latin and Italian.\n\n\"See, my son,\" said he, \"Heaven hath foreseen our several needs, and\ngiven us the means to satisfy them: let us change books; and, my dear\nson, I will give thee my poor prayers and welcome, not sell them thee. I\nlove not religious bargains.\"\n\nThe islander was delighted. \"So shall I learn the Italian tongue without\nrisk to my eternal weal, Near is my purse, but nearer is my soul.\"\n\nHe forced money on Clement. In vain the friar told him it was contrary\nto his vow to carry more of that than was barely necessary.\n\n\"Lay it out for the good of the Church and of my soul,\" said the\nislander. \"I ask you not to keep it, but take it you must and shall.\"\nAnd he grasped Clement's hand warmly again; and Clement kissed him on\nthe brow, and blessed him, and they went each his way.\n\nAbout a mile from where they parted, Clement found two tired wayfarers\nlying in the deep shade of a great chestnut-tree, one of a thick\ngrove the road skirted. Near the men was a little cart, and in it\na printing-press, rude and clumsy as a vine-press, A jaded mule was\nharnessed to the cart.\n\nAnd so Clement stood face to face with his old enemy.\n\nAnd as he eyed it, and the honest, blue-eyed faces of the wearied\ncraftsmen, he looked back as on a dream at the bitterness he had once\nfelt towards this machine. He looked kindly down on them, and said\nsoftly--\n\n\"Sweynheim!\"\n\nThe men started to their feet.\n\n\"Pannartz!\"\n\nThey scuttled into the wood, and were seen no more.\n\nClement was amazed, and stood puzzling himself.\n\nPresently a face peeped from behind a tree.\n\nClement addressed it, \"What fear ye?\"\n\nA quavering voice replied--\n\n\"Say, rather, by what magic you, a stranger, can call us by our names! I\nnever clapt eyes on you till now.\"\n\n\"O, superstition! I know ye, as all good workmen are known--by your\nworks. Come hither and I will tell ye.\"\n\nThey advanced gingerly from different sides; each regulating his advance\nby the other's.\n\n\"My children,\" said Clement, \"I saw a Lactantius in Rome, printed by\nSweynheim and Pannartz, disciples of Fust.\"\n\n\"D'ye hear that, Pannartz? our work has gotten to Rome already.\"\n\n\"By your blue eyes and flaxen hair I wist ye were Germans; and the\nprinting-press spoke for itself. Who then should ye be but Fust's\ndisciples, Pannartz and Sweynheim?\"\n\nThe honest Germans were now astonished that they had suspected magic in\nso simple a matter.\n\n\"The good father hath his wits about him, that is all,\" said Pannartz.\n\n\"Ay,\" said Sweynheim, \"and with those wits would he could tell us how to\nget this tired beast to the next town.\"\n\n\"Yea,\" said Sweynheim, \"and where to find money to pay for his meat and\nours when we get there.\"\n\n\"I will try,\" said Clement. \"Free the mule of the cart, and of all\nharness but the bare halter.\"\n\nThis was done, and the animal immediately lay down and rolled on his\nback in the dust like a kitten. Whilst he was thus employed, Clement\nassured them he would rise up a new mule.\n\n\"His Creator hath taught him this art to refresh himself, which the\nnobler horse knoweth not. Now, with regard to money, know that a worthy\nEnglishman hath entrusted me with a certain sum to bestow in charity.\nTo whom can I better give a stranger's money than to strangers? Take it,\nthen, and be kind to some Englishman or other stranger in his need; and\nmay all nations learn to love one another one day.\"\n\nThe tears stood in the honest workmen's eyes. They took the money with\nheartfelt thanks.\n\n\"It is your nation we are bound to thank and bless, good father, if we\nbut knew it.\"\n\n\"My nation is the Church.\"\n\nClement was then for bidding them farewell, but the honest fellows\nimplored him to wait a little; they had no silver nor gold, but they had\nsomething they could give their benefactor, They took the press out of\nthe cart, and while Clement fed the mule, they hustled about, now on the\nwhite hot road, now in the deep cool shade, now half in and half out,\nand presently printed a quarto sheet of eight pages, which was already\nset up. They had not type enough to print two sheets at a time. When,\nafter the slower preliminaries, the printed sheet was pulled all in a\nmoment, Clement was amazed in turn.\n\n\"What, are all these words really fast upon the paper?\" said he. \"Is it\nverily certain they will not go as swiftly as they came? And you took\nme for a magician! 'Tis 'Augustine de civitate Dei.' My sons, you carry\nhere the very wings of knowledge. Oh, never abuse this great craft!\nPrint no ill books! They would fly abroad countless as locusts, and lay\nwaste men's souls.\"\n\nThe workmen said they would sooner put their hands under the screw than\nso abuse their goodly craft.\n\nAnd so they parted.\n\nThere is nothing but meeting and parting in this world.\n\nAt a town in Tuscany the holy friar had a sudden and strange recontre\nwith the past. He fell in with one of those motley assemblages of\npatricians and plebeians, piety and profligacy, \"a company of pilgrims;\"\na subject too well painted by others for me to go and daub.\n\nThey were in an immense barn belonging to the inn, Clement, dusty and\nwearied, and no lover of idle gossip, sat in a corner studying the\nEnglishman's hours, and making them out as much by his own Dutch as by\nthe Latin version.\n\nPresently a servant brought a bucket half full of water, and put it down\nat his feet. A female servant followed with two towels. And then a woman\ncame forward, and crossing herself, kneeled down without a word at the\nbucket-side, removed her sleeves entirely, and motioned to him to put\nhis feet into the water. It was some lady of rank doing penance. She\nwore a mask scarce an inch broad, but effectual. Moreover, she handled\nthe friar's feet more delicately than those do who are born to such\noffices.\n\nThese penances were not uncommon; and Clement, though he had little\nfaith in this form of contrition, received the services of the incognita\nas a matter of course. But presently she sighed deeply, and with her\nheartfelt sigh and her head bent low over her menial office, she seemed\nso bowed with penitence, that he pitied her, and said calmly but gently,\n\"Can I aught for your soul's weal, my daughter?\"\n\nShe shook her head with a faint sob. \"Nought, holy father, nought; only\nto hear the sin of her who is most unworthy to touch thy holy feet. 'Tis\npart of my penance to tell sinless men how vile I am.\"\n\n\"Speak, my daughter.\"\n\n\"Father,\" said the lady, bending lower and lower, \"these hands of mine\nlook white, but they are stained with blood--the blood of the man I\nloved. Alas! you withdraw your foot. Ah me! What shall I do? All holy\nthings shrink from me.\"\n\n\"Culpa mea! culpa mea!\" said Clement eagerly. \"My daughter, it was an\nunworthy movement of earthly weakness, for which I shall do penance.\nJudge not the Church by her feebler servants, Not her foot, but her\nbosom, is offered to thee, repenting truly. Take courage, then, and\npurge thy conscience of its load.\"\n\nOn this the lady, in a trembling whisper, and hurriedly, and cringing a\nlittle, as if she feared the Church would strike her bodily for what she\nhad done, made this confession.\n\n\"He was a stranger, and base-born, but beautiful as Spring, and wise\nbeyond his years. I loved him, I had not the prudence to conceal my\nlove. Nobles courted me. I ne'er thought one of humble birth could\nreject me. I showed him my heart oh, shame of my sex! He drew back; yet\nhe admired me; but innocently, He loved another; and he was constant. I\nresorted to a woman's wiles, They availed not. I borrowed the wickedness\nof men, and threatened his life, and to tell his true lover he died\nfalse to her, Ah! you shrink your foot trembles. Am I not a monster?\nThen he wept and prayed to me for mercy; then my good angel helped me; I\nbade him leave Rome. Gerard, Gerard, why did you not obey me? I thought\nhe was gone. But two months after this I met him, Never shall I forget\nit. I was descending the Tiber in my galley, when he came up it with a\ngay company, and at his side a woman beautiful as an angel, but bold and\nbad. That woman claimed me aloud for her rival. Traitor and hypocrite,\nhe had exposed me to her, and to all the loose tongues in Rome. In\nterror and revenge I hired-a bravo. When he was gone on his bloody\nerrand, I wavered too late. The dagger I had hired struck, He never came\nback to his lodgings. He was dead. Alas! perhaps he was not so much to\nblame: none have ever cast his name in my teeth. His poor body is not\nfound: or I should kiss its wounds; and slay myself upon it. All around\nhis very name seems silent as the grave, to which this murderous hand\nhath sent him.\" (Clement's eye was drawn by her movement. He recognized\nher shapely arm, and soft white hand.) \"And oh! he was so young to die.\nA poor thoughtless boy, that had fallen a victim to that bad woman's\narts, and she had made him tell her everything. Monster of cruelty, what\npenance can avail me? Oh, holy father, what shall I do?\"\n\nClement's lips moved in prayer, but he was silent. He could not see his\nduty clear.\n\nThen she took his feet and began to dry them. She rested his foot\nupon her soft arm, and pressed it with the towel so gently she seemed\nincapable of hurting a fly. Yet her lips had just told another story,\nand a true one.\n\nWhile Clement was still praying for wisdom, a tear fell upon his foot.\nIt decided him. \"My daughter,\" said he, \"I myself have been a great\nsinner.\"\n\n\"You, father?\"\n\n\"I; quite as great a sinner as thou; though not in the same way. The\ndevil has gins and snares, as well as traps. But penitence softened my\nimpious heart, and then gratitude remoulded it. Therefore, seeing you\npenitent, I hope you can be grateful to Him, who has been more merciful\nto you than you have to your fellow-creature. Daughter, the Church sends\nyou comfort.\"\n\n\"Comfort to me? ah! never! unless it can raise my victim from the dead.\"\n\n\"Take this crucifix in thy hand, fix thine eyes on it, and listen to\nme,\" was all the reply.\n\n\"Yes, father; but let me thoroughly dry your feet first; 'tis ill\nsitting in wet feet; and you are the holiest man of all whose feet I\nhave washed. I know it by your voice.\"\n\n\"Woman, I am not. As for my feet, they can wait their turn. Obey thou\nme.\n\n\"Yes, father,\" said the lady humbly. But with a woman's evasive\npertinacity she wreathed one towel swiftly round the foot she was\ndrying, and placed his other foot on the dry napkin; then obeyed his\ncommand.\n\nAnd as she bowed over the crucifix, the low, solemn tones of the friar\nfell upon her ear, and his words soon made her whole body quiver with\nvarious emotion, in quick succession.\n\n\"My daughter, he you murdered--in intent--was one Gerard, a Hollander.\nHe loved a creature, as men should love none but their Redeemer and His\nChurch. Heaven chastised him. A letter came to Rome. She was dead.\"\n\n\"Poor Gerard! Poor Margaret!\" moaned the penitent.\n\nClement's voice faltered at this a moment. But soon, by a strong effort,\nhe recovered all his calmness.\n\n\"His feeble nature yielded, body and soul, to the blow, He was stricken\ndown with fever. He revived only to rebel against Heaven. He said,\n'There is no God.'\"\n\n\"Poor, poor Gerard!\"\n\n\"Poor Gerard? thou feeble, foolish woman! Nay, wicked, impious Gerard.\nHe plunged into vice, and soiled his eternal jewel: those you met\nhim with were his daily companions; but know, rash creature, that the\nseeming woman you took to be his leman was but a boy, dressed in woman's\nhabits to flout the others, a fair boy called Andrea. What that Andrea\nsaid to thee I know not; but be sure neither he, nor any layman, knows\nthy folly, This Gerard, rebel against Heaven, was no traitor to thee,\nunworthy.\"\n\nThe lady moaned like one in bodily agony, and the crucifix began to\ntremble in her trembling hands.\n\n\"Courage!\" said Clement. \"Comfort is at hand.\"\n\n\"From crime he fell into despair, and bent on destroying his soul, he\nstood one night by Tiber, resolved on suicide. He saw one watching him.\nIt was a bravo.\"\n\n\"Holy saints!\"\n\n\"He begged the bravo to despatch him; he offered him all his money, to\nslay him body and soul. The bravo would not. Then this desperate sinner,\nnot softened even by that refusal, flung himself into Tiber.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"And the assassin saved his life. Thou hadst chosen for the task\nLodovico, husband of Teresa, whom this Gerard had saved at sea, her and\nher infant child.\"\n\n\"He lives! he lives! he lives! I am faint.\"\n\nThe friar took the crucifix from her hands, fearing it might fall, A\nshower of tears relieved her. The friar gave her time; then continued\ncalmly, \"Ay, he lives; thanks to thee and thy wickedness, guided to his\neternal good by an almighty and all-merciful hand. Thou art his greatest\nearthly benefactor.\"\n\n\"Where is he? where? where?\"\n\n\"What is that to thee?\"\n\n\"Only to see him alive. To beg him on my knees forgive me. I swear to\nyou I will never presume again to--How could I? He knows all. Oh, shame!\nFather, does he know?\"\n\n\"All.\"\n\n\"Then never will I meet his eye; I should sink into the earth. But I\nwould repair my crime. I would watch his life unseen. He shall rise in\nthe world, whence I so nearly thrust him, poor soul; the Caesare, my\nfamily, are all-powerful in Rome; and I am near their head.\"\n\n\"My daughter,\" said Clement coldly, \"he you call Gerard needs nothing\nman can do for him. Saved by a miracle from double death, he has left\nthe world, and taken refuge from sin and folly in the bosom of the\nChurch.\"\n\n\"A priest?\"\n\n\"A priest, and a friar.\"\n\n\"A friar? Then you are not his confessor? Yet you know all. That gentle\nvoice!\"\n\nShe raised her head slowly, and peered at him through her mask.\n\nThe next moment she uttered a faint shriek, and lay with her brow upon\nhis bare feet.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXV\n\nClement sighed. He began to doubt whether he had taken the wisest course\nwith a creature so passionate.\n\nBut young as he was, he had already learned many lessons of\necclesiastical wisdom. For one thing he had been taught to pause, ie.,\nin certain difficulties, neither to do nor to say anything, until the\nmatter should clear itself a little.\n\nHe therefore held his peace and prayed for wisdom.\n\nAll he did was gently to withdraw his foot.\n\nBut his penitent flung her arms round it with a piteous cry, and held it\nconvulsively, and wept over it.\n\nAnd now the agony of shame, as well as penitence, she was in, showed\nitself by the bright red that crept over her very throat, as she lay\nquivering at his feet.\n\n\"My daughter,\" said Clement gently, \"take courage. Torment thyself no\nmore about this Gerard, who is not. As for me, I am Brother Clement,\nwhom Heaven hath sent to thee this day to comfort thee, and help thee\nsave thy soul. Thou last made me thy confessor, I claim, then, thine\nobedience.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes,\" sobbed the penitent.\n\n\"Leave this pilgrimage, and instant return to Rome. Penitence abroad is\nlittle worth. There where we live lie the temptations we must defeat, or\nperish; not fly in search of others more showy, but less lethal. Easy to\nwash the feet of strangers, masked ourselves, Hard to be merely meek and\ncharitable with those about us.\"\n\n\"I'll never, never lay finger on her again.\"\n\n\"Nay, I speak not of servants only, but of dependents, kinsmen, friends.\nThis be thy penance; the last thing at night, and the first thing after\nmatins, call to mind thy sin, and God His goodness; and so be humble and\ngentle to the faults of those around thee. The world it courts the rich;\nbut seek thou the poor: not beggars; these for the most are neither\nhonest nor truly poor. But rather find out those who blush to seek thee,\nyet need thee sore. Giving to them shalt lend to Heaven. Marry a good\nson of the Church.\"\n\n\"Me? I will never marry.\"\n\n\"Thou wilt marry within the year. I do entreat and command thee to marry\none that feareth God. For thou art very clay. Mated ill thou shalt be\nnaught. But wedding a worthy husband thou mayest, Dei gratia, live a\npious princess; ay, and die a saint.\"\n\n\"I?\"\n\n\"Thou.\"\n\nHe then desired her to rise and go about the good work he had set her.\n\nShe rose to her knees, and removing her mask, cast an eloquent look upon\nhim, then lowered her eyes meekly.\n\n\"I will obey you as I would an angel. How happy I am, yet unhappy; for\noh, my heart tells me I shall never look on you again. I will not go\ntill I have dried your feet.\"\n\n\"It needs not. I have excused thee this bootless penance.\"\n\n\"'Tis no penance to me. Ah! you do not forgive me, if you will not let\nme dry your poor feet.\"\n\n\"So be it then,\" said Clement resignedly; and thought to himself,\n\"Levius quid foemina.\"\n\nBut these weak creatures, that gravitate towards the small, as heavenly\nbodies towards the great, have yet their own flashes of angelic\nintelligence.\n\nWhen the princess had dried the friar's feet, she looked at him with\ntears in her beautiful eyes, and murmured with singular tenderness and\ngoodness--\n\n\"I will have masses said for her soul. May I?\" she added timidly.\n\nThis brought a faint blush into the monk's cheek, and moistened his cold\nblue eye. It came so suddenly from one he was just rating so low.\n\n\"It is a gracious thought,\" he said. \"Do as thou wilt: often such acts\nfall back on the doer like blessed dew. I am thy confessor, not hers;\nthine is the soul I must now do my all to save, or woe be to my own. My\ndaughter, my dear daughter, I see good and ill angels fighting for thy\nsoul this day, ay, this moment; oh, fight thou on thine own side. Dost\nthou remember all I bade thee?\"\n\n\"Remember!\" said the princess. \"Sweet saint, each syllable of thine is\ngraved in my heart.\"\n\n\"But one word more, then. Pray much to Christ, and little to his\nsaints.\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\n\"And that is the best word I have light to say to thee. So part we on\nit. Thou to the place becomes thee best, thy father's house, I to my\nholy mother's work.\"\n\n\"Adieu,\" faltered the princess. \"Adieu, thou that I have loved too well,\nhated too ill, known and revered too late; forgiving angel, adieu--for\never.\"\n\nThe monk caught her words, though but faltered in a sigh.\n\n\"For ever?\" he cried aloud, with sudden ardour. \"Christians live 'for\never,' and love 'for ever,' but they never part 'for ever. They part, as\npart the earth and sun, to meet more brightly in a little while. You and\nI part here for life. And what is our life? One line in the great story\nof the Church, whose son and daughter we are; one handful in the sand of\ntime, one drop in the ocean of 'For ever.' Adieu--for the little moment\ncalled 'a life!' We part in trouble, we shall meet in peace: we part\ncreatures of clay, we shall meet immortal spirits: we part in a world of\nsin and sorrow, we shall meet where all is purity and love divine; where\nno ill passions are, but Christ is, and His saints around Him clad in\nwhite. There, in the turning of an hour-glass, in the breaking of a\nbubble, in the passing of a cloud, she, and thou, and I, shall meet\nagain; and sit at the feet of angels and archangels, apostles and\nsaints, and beam like them with joy unspeakable, in the light of the\nshadow of God upon His throne, FOR EVER--AND EVER--AND EVER.\"\n\nAnd so they parted. The monk erect, his eyes turned heavenwards and\nglowing with the sacred fire of zeal; the princess slowly retiring and\nturning more than once to cast a lingering glance of awe and tender\nregret on that inspired figure.\n\nShe went home subdued, and purified. Clement, in due course, reached\nBasle, and entered on his duties, teaching in the University, and\npreaching in the town and neighbourhood. He led a life that can be\ncomprised in two words; deep study, and mortification. My reader has\nalready a peep into his soul. At Basle he advanced in holy zeal and\nknowledge.\n\nThe brethren of his order began to see in him a descendant of the saints\nand martyrs.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVI\n\nTHE HEARTH\n\nWhen little Gerard was nearly three months old, a messenger came hot\nfrom Tergou for Catherine.\n\n\"Now just you go back,\" said she, \"and tell them I can't come, and I\nwon't: they have got Kate,\" So he departed, and Catherine continued her\nsentence; \"there, child, I must go: they are all at sixes and sevens:\nthis is the third time of asking; and to-morrow my man would come\nhimself and take me home by the ear, with a flea in't.\" She then\nrecapitulated her experiences of infants, and instructed Margaret what\nto do in each coming emergency, and pressed money upon her, Margaret\ndeclined it with thanks, Catherine insisted, and turned angry. Margaret\nmade excuses all so reasonable that Catherine rejected them with calm\ncontempt; to her mind they lacked femininity,\n\n\"Come, out with your heart,\" said she \"and you and me parting; and\nmayhap shall never see one another's face again.\"\n\n\"Oh! mother, say not so.\"\n\n\"Alack, girl, I have seen it so often; 'twill come into my mind now at\neach parting, When I was your age, I never had such a thought, Nay, we\nwere all to live for ever then: so out wi' it.\"\n\n\"Well, then, mother--I would rather not have told you--your Cornelis\nmust say to me, 'So you are come to share with us, eh, mistress?' those\nwere his words, I told him I would be very sorry.\n\n\"Beshrew his ill tongue! What signifies it? He will never know,\n\n\"Most likely he would sooner or later, But whether or no, I will take\nno grudged bounty from any family; unless I saw my child starving,\nand--Heaven only knows what I might do, Nay, mother, give me but thy\nlove--I do prize that above silver, and they grudge me not that, by all\nI can find--for not a stiver of money will I take out of your house.\"\n\n\"You are a foolish lass, Why, were it me, I'd take it just to spite\nhim.\"\n\n\"No, you would not, You and I are apples off one tree\"\n\nCatherine yielded with a good grace; and when the actual parting came,\nembraces and tears burst forth on both sides.\n\nWhen she was gone the child cried a good deal; and all attempts to\npacify him failing, Margaret suspected a pin, and searching between his\nclothes and his skin, found a gold angel incommoding his backbone.\n\n\"There, now, Gerard,\" said she to the babe; \"I thought granny gave in\nrather sudden.\"\n\nShe took the coin and wrapped it in a piece of linen, and laid it at the\nbottom of her box, bidding the infant observe she could be at times as\nresolute as granny herself.\n\nCatherine told Eli of Margaret's foolish pride, and how she had baffled\nit. Eli said Margaret was right, and she was wrong.\n\nCatherine tossed her head. Eli pondered.\n\nMargaret was not without domestic anxieties. She had still two men to\nfeed, and could not work so hard as she had done. She had enough to do\nto keep the house, and the child, and cook for them all. But she had a\nlittle money laid by, and she used to tell her child his father would be\nhome to help them before it was spent. And with these bright hopes, and\nthat treasury of bliss, her boy, she spent some happy months.\n\nTime wore on; and no Gerard came; and stranger still, no news of him.\n\nThen her mind was disquieted, and contrary to her nature, which was\npractical, she was often lost in sad reverie; and sighed in silence. And\nwhile her heart was troubled, her money was melting. And so it was,\nthat one day she found the cupboard empty, and looked in her dependents'\nfaces; and at the sight of them, her bosom was all pity; and she\nappealed to the baby whether she could let grandfather and poor old\nMartin want a meal; and went and took out Catherine's angel. As she\nunfolded the linen a tear of gentle mortification fell on it. She sent\nMartin out to change it. While he was gone a Frenchman came with one of\nthe dealers in illuminated work, who had offered her so poor a price.\nHe told her he was employed by his sovereign to collect masterpieces for\nher book of hours. Then she showed him the two best things she had; and\nhe was charmed with one of them, viz., the flowers and raspberries and\ncreeping things, which Margaret Van Eyck had shaded. He offered her an\nunheard-of price. \"Nay, flout not my need, good stranger,\" said she;\n\"three mouths there be in this house, and none to fill them but me.\"\n\nCurious arithmetic! Left out No. 1.\n\n\"I'd out thee not, fair mistress. My princess charged me strictly, 'Seek\nthe best craftsmen'; but I will no hard bargains; make them content with\nme, and me with them.'\"\n\nThe next minute Margaret was on her knees kissing little Gerard in\nthe cradle, and showering four gold pieces on him again and again, and\nrelating the whole occurrence to him in very broken Dutch,\n\n\"And oh, what a good princess: wasn't she? We will pray for her, won't\nwe, my lambkin; when we are old enough?\"\n\nMartin came in furious. \"They will not change it. I trow they think I\nstole it.\"\n\n\"I am beholden to thee,\" said Margaret hastily, and almost snatched\nit from Martin, and wrapped it up again, and restored it to its\nhiding-place.\n\nEre these unexpected funds were spent, she got to her ironing and\nstarching again. In the midst of which Martin sickened; and died after\nan illness of nine days.\n\nNearly all her money went to bury him decently.\n\nHe was gone; and there was an empty chair by her fireside, For he had\npreferred the hearth to the sun as soon as the Busy Body was gone.\n\nMargaret would not allow anybody to sit in this chair now. Yet whenever\nshe let her eye dwell too long on it vacant, it was sure to cost her a\ntear.\n\nAnd now there was nobody to carry her linen home, To do it herself she\nmust leave little Gerard in charge of a neighbour, But she dared not\ntrust such a treasure to mortal; and besides she could not bear him out\nof her sight for hours and hours. So she set inquiries on foot for a boy\nto carry her basket on Saturday and Monday.\n\nA plump, fresh-coloured youth, called Luke Peterson, who looked fifteen,\nbut was eighteen, came in, and blushing, and twiddling his bonnet, asked\nher if a man would not serve her turn as well as a boy.\n\nBefore he spoke she was saying to herself, \"This boy will just do.\"\n\nBut she took the cue, and said, \"Nay; but a man will maybe seek more\nthan I can well pay.\n\n\"Not I,\" said Luke warmly. \"Why, Mistress Margaret, I am your neighbour,\nand I do very well at the coopering. I can carry your basket for you\nbefore or after my day's work, and welcome, You have no need to pay me\nanything. 'Tisn't as if we were strangers, ye know.\"\n\n\"Why, Master Luke, I know your face, for that matter; but I cannot call\nto mind that ever a word passed between us.\"\n\n\"Oh yes, you did, Mistress Margaret. What, have you forgotten? One day\nyou were trying to carry your baby and eke your pitcher full o' water;\nand quo' I, 'Give me the baby to carry.' 'Nay, says you, 'I'll give you\nthe pitcher, and keep the bairn myself;' and I carried the pitcher home,\nand you took it from me at this door, and you said to me, 'I am muckle\nobliged to you, young man,' with such a sweet voice; not like the folk\nin this street speak to a body.\"\n\n\"I do mind now, Master Luke; and methinks it was the least I could say.\"\n\n\"Well, Mistress Margaret, if you will say as much every time I carry\nyour basket, I care not how often I bear it, nor how far.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" said Margaret, colouring faintly. \"I would not put upon\ngood nature, You are young, Master Luke, and kindly. Say I give you\nyour supper on Saturday night, when you bring the linen home, and your\ndawn-mete o' Monday; would that make us anyways even?\"\n\n\"As you please; only say not I sought a couple o' diets! for such a\ntrifle as yon.\"\n\nWith chubby-faced Luke's timely assistance, and the health and strength\nwhich Heaven gave this poor young woman, to balance her many ills, the\nhouse went pretty smoothly awhile. But the heart became more and more\ntroubled by Gerard's long, and now most mysterious silence.\n\nAnd then that mental torturer, Suspense, began to tear her heavy heart\nwith his hot pincers, till she cried often and vehemently, \"Oh, that I\ncould know the worst.\"\n\nWhilst she was in this state, one day she heard a heavy step mount\nthe stair. She started and trembled, \"That is no step that I know. Ill\ntidings?\"\n\nThe door opened, and an unexpected visitor, Eli, came in, looking grave\nand kind.\n\nMargaret eyed him in silence, and with increasing agitation,\n\n\"Girl.\" said he, \"the skipper is come back.\"\n\n\"One word,\" gasped Margaret; \"is he alive?\"\n\n\"Surely I hope so. No one has seen him dead.\"\n\n\"Then they must have seen him alive.\"\n\n\"No, girl; neither dead nor alive hath he been seen this many months in\nRome. My daughter Kate thinks he is gone to some other city. She bade me\ntell you her thought.\"\n\n\"Ay, like enough,\" said Margaret gloomily; \"like enough. My poor babe!\"\n\nThe old man in a faintish voice asked her for a morsel to eat: he had\ncome fasting.\n\nThe poor thing pitied him with the surface of her agitated mind, and\ncooked a meal for him, trembling, and scarce knowing what she was about.\n\nEre he went he laid his hand upon her head, and said, \"Be he alive, or\nbe he dead, I look on thee as my daughter. Can I do nought for thee this\nday? bethink thee now?\"\n\n\"Ay, old man. Pray for him; and for me!\"\n\nEli sighed, and went sadly and heavily down the stairs.\n\nShe listened half stupidly to his retiring footsteps till they ceased.\nThen she sank moaning down by the cradle, and drew little Gerard tight\nto her bosom. \"Oh, my poor fatherless boy; my fatherless boy!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVII\n\nNot long after this, as the little family at Tergou sat at dinner, Luke\nPeterson burst in on them, covered with dust. \"Good people, Mistress\nCatherine is wanted instantly at Rotterdam.\"\n\n\"My name is Catherine, young man. Kate, it will be Margaret.\"\n\n\"Ay, dame, she said to me, 'Good Luke, hie thee to Tergou, and ask for\nEli the hosier, and pray his wife Catherine to come to me, for God His\nlove.' I didn't wait for daylight.\"\n\n\"Holy saints! He has come home, Kate. Nay, she would sure have said so.\nWhat on earth can it be?\" And she heaped conjecture on conjecture.\n\n\"Mayhap the young man can tell us,\" hazarded Kate timidly.\n\n\"That I can,\" said Luke, \"Why, her babe is a-dying, And she was so\nwrapped up in it!\"\n\nCatherine started up: \"What is his trouble?\"\n\n\"Nay, I know not. But it has been peaking and pining worse and worse\nthis while.\"\n\nA furtive glance of satisfaction passed between Cornelis and Sybrandt.\nLuckily for them Catherine did not see it. Her face was turned towards\nher husband. \"Now, Eli,\" cried she furiously, \"if you say a word against\nit, you and I shall quarrel, after all these years.'\n\n\"Who gainsays thee, foolish woman? Quarrel with your own shadow, while I\ngo borrow Peter's mule for ye.\"\n\n\"Bless thee, my good man! Bless thee! Didst never yet fail me at a\npinch, Now eat your dinners who can, while I go and make ready.\"\n\nShe took Luke back with her in the cart, and on the way questioned and\ncross-questioned him severely and seductively by turns, till she had\nturned his mind inside out, what there was of it.\n\nMargaret met her at the door, pale and agitated, and threw her arms\nround her neck, and looked imploringly in her face.\n\n\"Come, he is alive, thank God,\" said Catherine, after scanning her\neagerly.\n\nShe looked at the failing child, and then at the poor hollow-eyed\nmother, alternately, \"Lucky you sent for me,\" said she, \"The child is\npoisoned.\"\n\n\"Poisoned! by whom?\"\n\n\"By you. You have been fretting.\"\n\n\"Nay, indeed, mother. How can I help fretting?\"\n\n\"Don't tell me, Margaret. A nursing mother has no business to fret. She\nmust turn her mind away from her grief to the comfort that lies in her\nlap. Know you not that the child pines if the mother vexes herself? This\ncomes of your reading and writing. Those idle crafts befit a man;\nbut they keep all useful knowledge out of a woman. The child must be\nweaned.\"\n\n\"Oh, you cruel woman,\" cried Margaret vehemently; \"I am sorry I sent for\nyou. Would you rob me of the only bit of comfort I have in the world?\nA-nursing my Gerard, I forget I am the most unhappy creature beneath the\nsun.\"\n\n\"That you do not,\" was the retort, \"or he would not be the way he is.\"\n\n\"Mother!\" said Margaret imploringly.\n\n\"'Tis hard,\" replied Catherine, relenting. \"But bethink thee; would it\nnot be harder to look down and see his lovely wee face a-looking up at\nyou out of a little coffin?\"\n\n\"Oh, Jesu!\"\n\n\"And how could you face your other troubles with your heart aye full,\nand your lap empty?\"\n\n\"Oh, mother, I consent to anything. Only save my boy.\"\n\n\"That is a good lass, Trust to me! I do stand by, and see clearer than\nthou.\"\n\nUnfortunately there was another consent to be gained--the babe's; and he\nwas more refractory than his mother.\n\n\"There,\" said Margaret, trying to affect regret at his misbehaviour; \"he\nloves me too well.\"\n\nBut Catherine was a match for them both. As she came along she had\nobserved a healthy young woman, sitting outside her own door, with an\ninfant, hard by. She went and told her the case; and would she nurse the\npining child for the nonce, till she had matters ready to wean him?\n\nThe young woman consented with a smile, and popped her child into the\ncradle, and came into Margaret's house. She dropped a curtsey, and\nCatherine put the child into her hands. She examined, and pitied it, and\npurred over it, and proceeded to nurse it, just as if it had been her\nown.\n\nMargaret, who had been paralyzed at her assurance, cast a rueful look at\nCatherine, and burst out crying.\n\nThe visitor looked up. \"What is to do? Wife, ye told me not the mother\nwas unwilling.\"\n\n\"She is not: she is only a fool. Never heed her; and you, Margaret, I am\nashamed of you.\"\n\n\"You are a cruel, hard-hearted woman,\" sobbed Margaret.\n\n\"Them as take in hand to guide the weak need be hardish. And you will\nexcuse me; but you are not my flesh and blood; and your boy is.\"\n\nAfter giving this blunt speech time to sink, she added, \"Come now, she\nis robbing her own to save yours, and you can think of nothing better\nthan bursting out a-blubbering in the woman's face. Out fie, for shame!\"\n\n\"Nay, wife,\" said the nurse. \"Thank Heaven, I have enough for my own\nand for hers to boot. And prithee wyte not on her! Maybe the troubles o'\nlife ha' soured her own milk.\"\n\n\"And her heart into the bargain,\" said the remorseless Catherine.\n\nMargaret looked her full in the face; and down went her eyes.\n\n\"I know I ought to be very grateful to you,\" sobbed Margaret to the\nnurse: then turned her head and leaned away over the chair, not to\nwitness the intolerable sight of another nursing her Gerard, and Gerard\ndrawing no distinction between this new mother and her the banished one.\n\nThe nurse replied, \"You are very welcome, my poor woman. And so are you,\nMistress Catherine, which are my townswoman, and know it not.\"\n\n\"What, are ye from Tergou? all the better, But I cannot call your face\nto mind.\"\n\n\"Oh, you know not me: my husband and me, we are very humble folk by you.\nBut true Eli and his wife are known of all the town; and respected,\nSo, I am at your call, dame; and at yours, wife; and yours, my pretty\npoppet; night or day.\"\n\n\"There's a woman of the right old sort,\" said Catherine, as the door\nclosed upon her.\n\n\"I HATE her. I HATE her. I HATE her,\" said Margaret, with wonderful\nfervour.\n\nCatherine only laughed at this outburst.\n\n\"That is right,\" said she; \"better say it, as set sly and think it. It\nis very natural after all, Come, here is your bundle o' comfort. Take\nand hate that, if ye can;\" and she put the child in her lap.\n\n\"No, no,\" said Margaret, turning her head half way from him; she could\nnot for her life turn the other half. \"He is not my child now; he is\nhers. I know not why she left him here, for my part. It was very good of\nher not to take him to her house, cradle and all; oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! oh\noh! oh!\"\n\n\"Ah! well, one comfort, he is not dead. This gives me light: some other\nwoman has got him away from me; like father, like son; oh! oh! oh! oh!\noh!\"\n\nCatherine was sorry for her, and let her cry in peace. And after that,\nwhen she wanted Joan's aid, she used to take Gerard out, to give him\na little fresh air. Margaret never objected; nor expressed the least\nincredulity; but on their return was always in tears.\n\nThis connivance was short-lived. She was now altogether as eager to\nwean little Gerard. It was done; and he recovered health and vigour; and\nanother trouble fell upon him directly teething, But here Catherine's\nexperience was invaluable; and now, in the midst of her grief and\nanxiety about the father, Margaret had moments of bliss, watching the\nson's tiny teeth come through. \"Teeth, mother? I call them not teeth,\nbut pearls of pearls.\" And each pearl that peeped and sparkled on his\nred gums, was to her the greatest feat Nature had ever achieved.\n\nHer companion partook the illusion. And had we told them standing corn\nwas equally admirable, Margaret would have changed to a reproachful\ngazelle, and Catherine turned us out of doors; so each pearl's arrival\nwas announced with a shriek of triumph by whichever of them was the\nfortunate discoverer.\n\nCatherine gossiped with Joan, and learned that she was the wife of\nJorian Ketel of Tergou, who had been servant to Ghysbrecht Van Swieten,\nbut fallen out of favour, and come back to Rotterdam, his native place.\nHis friends had got him the place of sexton to the parish, and what with\nthat and carpentering, he did pretty well.\n\nCatherine told Joan in return whose child it was she had nursed, and all\nabout Margaret and Gerard, and the deep anxiety his silence had plunged\nthem in. \"Ay,\" said Joan, \"the world is full of trouble.\" One day she\nsaid to Catherine, \"It's my belief my man knows more about your Gerard\nthan anybody in these parts; but he has got to be closer than ever of\nlate. Drop in some day just afore sunset, and set him talking. And for\nour Lady's sake say not I set you on. The only hiding he ever gave me\nwas for babbling his business; and I do not want another. Gramercy! I\nmarried a man for the comfort of the thing, not to be hided.\"\n\nCatherine dropped in. Jorian was ready enough to tell her how he had\nbefriended her son and perhaps saved his life. But this was no news to\nCatherine; and the moment she began to cross-question him as to whether\nhe could guess why her lost boy neither came nor wrote, he cast a grim\nlook at his wife, who received it with a calm air of stolid candour and\ninnocent unconsciousness; and his answers became short and sullen.\n\n\"What should he know more than another?\" and so on. He added, after a\npause, \"Think you the burgomaster takes such as me into his secrets?\"\n\n\"Oh, then the burgomaster knows something?\" said Catherine sharply.\n\n\"Likely. Who else should?\"\n\n\"I'll ask him.\"\n\n\"I would.\"\n\n\"And tell him you say he knows.\"\n\n\"That is right, dame. Go make him mine enemy. That is what a poor fellow\nalways gets if he says a word to you women.\"\n\nAnd Jorian from that moment shrunk in and became impenetrable as a\nhedgehog, and almost as prickly.\n\nHis conduct caused both the poor women agonies of mind, alarm, and\nirritated curiosity. Ghysbrecht was for some cause Gerard's mortal\nenemy; had stopped his marriage, imprisoned him, hunted him. And here\nwas his late servant, who when off his guard had hinted that this enemy\nhad the clue to Gerard's silence. After sifting Jorian's every word and\nlook, all remained dark and mysterious. Then Catherine told Margaret to\ngo herself to him. \"You are young, you are fair. You will maybe get more\nout of him than I could.\"\n\nThe conjecture was a reasonable one.\n\nMargaret went with her child in her arms and tapped timidly at Jorian's\ndoor just before sunset. \"Come in,\" said a sturdy voice. She entered,\nand there sat Jorian by the fireside. At sight of her he rose, snorted,\nand burst out of the house. \"Is that for me, wife?\" inquired Margaret,\nturning very red.\n\n\"You must excuse him,\" replied Joan, rather coldly; \"he lays it to your\ndoor that he is a poor man instead of a rich one. It is something about\na piece of parchment, There was one amissing, and he got nought from the\nburgomaster all along of that one.\"\n\n\"Alas! Gerard took it.\"\n\n\"Likely, But my man says you should not have let him: you were pledged\nto him to keep them all safe. And sooth to Say, I blame not my Jorian\nfor being wroth, 'Tis hard for a poor man to be so near fortune and lose\nit by those he has befriended. However, I tell him another story. Says\nI, 'Folk that are out o' trouble like you and me didn't ought to be too\nhard on folk that are in trouble; and she has plenty. Going already?\nWhat is all your hurry, mistress?\"\n\n\"Oh, it is not for me to drive the goodman out of his own house.\"\n\n\"Well, let me kiss the bairn afore ye go. He is not in fault anyway,\npoor innocent.\"\n\nUpon this cruel rebuff Margaret came to a resolution, which she did not\nconfide even to Catherine.\n\nAfter six weeks' stay that good woman returned home.\n\nOn the child's birthday, which occurred soon after, Margaret did no\nwork; but put on her Sunday clothes, and took her boy in her arms and\nwent to the church and prayed there long and fervently for Gerard's safe\nreturn.\n\nThat same day and hour Father Clement celebrated a mass and prayed for\nMargaret's departed soul in the minster church at Basle.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXVIII\n\nSome blackguard or other, I think it was Sybrandt, said, \"A lie is not\nlike a blow with a curtal axe.\"\n\nTrue: for we can predict in some degree the consequences of a stroke\nwith any material weapon. But a lie has no bounds at all. The nature of\nthe thing is to ramify beyond human calculation.\n\nOften in the everyday world a lie has cost a life, or laid waste two or\nthree.\n\nAnd so, in this story, what tremendous consequences of that one\nheartless falsehood!\n\nYet the tellers reaped little from it.\n\nThe brothers, who invented it merely to have one claimant the less for\ntheir father's property, saw little Gerard take their brother's place\nin their mother's heart. Nay, more, one day Eli openly proclaimed that,\nGerard being lost, and probably dead, he had provided by will for little\nGerard, and also for Margaret, his poor son's widow.\n\nAt this the look that passed between the black sheep was a caution to\ntraitors. Cornelis had it on his lips to say. Gerard was most likely\nalive, But he saw his mother looking at him, and checked himself in\ntime.\n\nGhysbrecht Van Swieten, the other partner in that lie, was now a failing\nman. He saw the period fast approaching when all his wealth would drop\nfrom his body, and his misdeeds cling to his soul.\n\nToo intelligent to deceive himself entirely, he had never been free\nfrom gusts of remorse. In taking Gerard's letter to Margaret he had\ncompounded. \"I cannot give up land and money,\" said his giant Avarice.\n\"I will cause her no unnecessary pain,\" said his dwarf Conscience.\n\nSo, after first tampering with the seal, and finding there was not a\nsyllable about the deed, he took it to her with his own hand; and made a\nmerit of it to himself: a set-off; and on a scale not uncommon where the\nself-accuser is the judge.\n\nThe birth of Margaret's child surprised and shocked him, and put his\ntreacherous act in a new light. Should his letter take effect he should\ncause the dishonour of her who was the daughter of one friend, the\ngranddaughter of another, and whose land he was keeping from her too.\n\nThese thoughts preying on him at that period of life when the strength\nof body decays, and the memory of old friends revives, filled him with\ngloomy horrors. Yet he was afraid to confess. For the cure was an honest\nman, and would have made him disgorge. And with him Avarice was an\ningrained habit, Penitence only a sentiment.\n\nMatters were thus when, one day, returning from the town hall to his own\nhouse, he found a woman waiting for him in the vestibule, with a child\nin her arms. She was veiled, and so, concluding she had something to\nbe ashamed of, he addressed her magisterially, On this she let down her\nveil and looked him full in the face.\n\nIt was Margaret Brandt.\n\nHer sudden appearance and manner startled him, and he could not conceal\nhis confusion.\n\n\"Where is my Gerard?\" cried she, her bosom heaving. \"Is he alive?\"\n\n\"For aught I know,\" stammered Ghysbrecht. \"I hope so, for your sake.\nPrithee come into this room. The servants!\"\n\n\"Not a step,\" said Margaret, and she took him by the shoulder, and held\nhim with all the energy of an excited woman. \"You know the secret of\nthat which is breaking my heart. Why does not my Gerard come, nor send\na line this many months? Answer me, or all the town is like to hear me,\nlet alone thy servants, My misery is too great to be sported with.\"\n\nIn vain he persisted he knew nothing about Gerard. She told him those\nwho had sent her to him told her another tale.\n\n\"You do know why he neither comes nor sends,\" said she firmly.\n\nAt this Ghysbrecht turned paler and paler; but he summoned all his\ndignity, and said, \"Would you believe those two knaves against a man of\nworship?\"\n\n\"What two knaves?\" said she keenly.\n\nHe stammered, \"Said ye not--? There I am a poor old broken man, whose\nmemory is shaken. And you come here, and confuse me so, I know not what\nI say.\"\n\n\"Ay, sir, your memory is shaken, or sure you would not be my enemy. My\nfather saved you from the plague, when none other would come anigh you;\nand was ever your friend. My grandfather Floris helped you in your early\npoverty, and loved you, man and boy. Three generations of us you have\nseen; and here is the fourth of us; this is your old friend Peter's\ngrandchild, and your old friend Floris his great-grandchild. Look down\non his innocent face, and think of theirs!\"\n\n\"Woman, you torture me,\" sighed Ghysbrecht, and sank upon a bench. But\nshe saw her advantage, and kneeled before him, and put the boy on his\nknees. \"This fatherless babe is poor Margaret Brandt's, that never did\nyou ill, and comes of a race that loved you. Nay, look at his face.\n'Twill melt thee more than any word of mine, Saints of heaven, what can\na poor desolate girl and her babe have done to wipe out all memory of\nthine own young days, when thou wert guiltless as he is, that now looks\nup in thy face and implores thee to give him back his father?\"\n\nAnd with her arms under the child she held him up higher and higher,\nsmiling under the old man's eyes.\n\nHe cast a wild look of anguish on the child, and another on the kneeling\nmother, and started up shrieking, \"Avaunt, ye pair of adders.\"\n\nThe stung soul gave the old limbs a momentary vigour, and he walked\nrapidly, wringing his hands and clutching at his white hair. \"Forget\nthose days? I forget all else. Oh, woman, woman, sleeping or waking I\nsee but the faces of the dead, I hear but the voices of the dead, and I\nshall soon be among the dead, There, there, what is done is done. I am\nin hell. I am in hell.\"\n\nAnd unnatural force ended in prostration.\n\nHe staggered, and but for Margaret would have fallen, With her one\ndisengaged arm she supported him as well as she could and cried for\nhelp.\n\nA couple of servants came running, and carried him away in a state\nbordering on syncope, The last Margaret saw of him was his old furrowed\nface, white and helpless as his hair that hung down over the servant's\nelbow.\n\n\"Heaven forgive me,\" she said. \"I doubt I have killed the poor old man.\"\n\nThen this attempt to penetrate the torturing mystery left it as dark,\nor darker than before. For when she came to ponder every word, her\nsuspicion was confirmed that Ghysbrecht did know something about Gerard.\n\"And who were the two knaves he thought had done a good deed, and told\nme? Oh, my Gerard, my poor deserted babe, you and I are wading in deep\nwaters.\"\n\nThe visit to Tergou took more money than she could well afford; and a\ncustomer ran away in her debt. She was once more compelled to unfold\nCatherine's angel. But strange to say, as she came down stairs with it\nin her hand she found some loose silver on the table, with a written\nline--\n\nFor Gerard his wife.\n\nShe fell with a cry of surprise on the writing; and soon it rose into a\ncry of joy.\n\n\"He is alive. He sends me this by some friendly hand.\"\n\nShe kissed the writing again and again, and put it in her bosom.\n\nTime rolled on, and no news of Gerard.\n\nAnd about every two months a small sum in silver found its way into the\nhouse. Sometimes it lay on the table. Once it was flung in through the\nbedroom window in a purse. Once it was at the bottom of Luke's basket.\nHe had stopped at the public-house to talk to a friend. The giver or his\nagent was never detected. Catherine disowned it. Margaret Van Eyck swore\nshe had no hand in it. So did Eli. And Margaret, whenever it came, used\nto say to little Gerard, \"Oh, my poor deserted child, you and I are\nwading in deep waters.\"\n\nShe applied at least half this modest, but useful supply, to dressing\nthe little Gerard beyond his station in life. \"If it does come from\nGerard, he shall see his boy neat.\" All the mothers in the street began\nto sneer, especially such as had brats out at elbows.\n\nThe months rolled on, and dead sickness of heart succeeded to these\nkeener torments. She returned to her first thought: \"Gerard must be\ndead. She should never see her boy's father again, nor her marriage\nlines.\" This last grief, which had been somewhat allayed by Eli and\nCatherine recognizing her betrothal, now revived in full force; others\nwould not look so favourably on her story. And often she moaned over her\nboy's illegitimacy.\n\n\"Is it not enough for us to be bereaved? Must we be dishonoured too? Oh,\nthat we had ne'er been born.\"\n\nA change took place in Peter Brandt. His mind, clouded for nearly two\nyears, seemed now to be clearing; he had intervals of intelligence; and\nthen he and Margaret used to talk of Gerard, till he wandered again. But\none day, returning after an absence of some hours, Margaret found\nhim conversing with Catherine, in a way he had never done since his\nparalytic stroke. \"Eh, girl, why must you be out?\" said she. \"But\nindeed I have told him all; and we have been a-crying together over thy\ntroubles.\"\n\nMargaret stood silent, looking joyfully from one to the other.\n\nPeter smiled on her, and said, \"Come, let me bless thee.\"\n\nShe kneeled at his feet, and he blessed her most eloquently.\n\nHe told her she had been all her life the lovingest, truest, and most\nobedient daughter Heaven ever sent to a poor old widowed man. \"May thy\nson be to thee what thou hast been to me!\"\n\nAfter this he dozed. Then the females whispered together; and Catherine\nsaid--\"All our talk e'en now was of Gerard. It lies heavy on his mind.\nHis poor head must often have listened to us when it seemed quite dark.\nMargaret, he is a very understanding man; he thought of many things: 'He\nmay be in prison, says he, 'or forced to go fighting for some king,\nor sent to Constantinople to copy books there, or gone into the Church\nafter all.' He had a bent that way.\"\n\n\"Ah, mother,\" whispered Margaret, in reply, \"he doth but deceive himself\nas we do.\"\n\nEre she could finish the sentence, a strange interruption occurred.\n\nA loud voice cried out, \"I SEE HIM, I SEE HIM.\"\n\nAnd the old man with dilating eyes seemed to be looking right through\nthe wall of the house.\n\n\"IN A BOAT; ON A GREAT RIVER; COMING THIS WAY. Sore disfigured; but I\nknew him. Gone! gone! all dark.\"\n\nAnd he sank back, and asked feebly where was Margaret.\n\n\"Dear father, I am by thy side, Oh, mother! mother, what is this?\"\n\n\"I cannot see thee, and but a moment agone I saw all round the world,\nAy, ay. Well, I am ready. Is this thy hand? Bless thee, my child, bless\nthee! Weep not! The tree is ripe.\"\n\nThe old physician read the signs aright. These calm words were his last.\nThe next moment he drooped his head, and gently, placidly, drifted away\nfrom earth, like an infant sinking to rest, The torch had flashed up\nbefore going out.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXIX\n\nShe who had wept for poor old Martin was not likely to bear this blow so\nstoically as the death of the old is apt to be borne. In vain Catherine\ntried to console her with commonplaces; in vain told her it was a happy\nrelease for him; and that, as he himself had said, the tree was ripe.\nBut her worst failure was, when she urged that there were now but two\nmouths to feed; and one care the less.\n\n\"Such cares are all the joys I have,\" said Margaret. \"They fill my\ndesolate heart, which now seems void as well as waste. Oh, empty chair,\nmy bosom it aches to see thee. Poor old man, how could I love him by\nhalves, I that did use to sit and look at him and think, 'But for me\nthou wouldst die of hunger.' He, so wise, so learned erst, was got to\nbe helpless as my own sweet babe, and I loved him as if he had been\nmy child instead of my father. Oh, empty chair! Oh, empty heart!\nWell-a-day! well-a-day!\"\n\nAnd the pious tears would not be denied.\n\nThen Catherine held her peace; and hung her head. And one day she made\nthis confession, \"I speak to thee out o' my head, and not out o' my\nbosom; thou dost well to be deaf to me. Were I in thy place I should\nmourn the old man all one as thou dost.\"\n\nThen Margaret embraced her, and this bit of true sympathy did her a\nlittle good. The commonplaces did none.\n\nThen Catherine's bowels yearned over her, and she said, \"My poor girl,\nyou were not born to live alone. I have got to look on you as my own\ndaughter. Waste not thine youth upon my son Gerard. Either he is dead or\nhe is a traitor. It cuts my heart to say it; but who can help seeing it?\nThy father is gone; and I cannot always be aside thee. And here is\nan honest lad that loves thee well this many a day. I'd take him and\nComfort together. Heaven hath sent us these creatures to torment us and\ncomfort us and all; we are just nothing in the world without 'em,\" Then\nseeing Margaret look utterly perplexed, she went on to say, \"Why, sure\nyou are not so blind as not to see it?\"\n\n\"What? Who?\"\n\n\"Who but this Luke Peterson.\"\n\n\"What, our Luke? The boy that carries my basket?\"\n\n\"Nay, he is over nineteen, and a fine healthy lad; and I have made\ninquiries for you; and they all do say he is a capable workman, and\nnever touches a drop; and that is much in a Rotterdam lad, which they\nare mostly half man, half sponge.\"\n\nMargaret smiled for the first time this many days. \"Luke loves dried\npuddings dearly,\" said she, \"and I make them to his mind, 'Tis them he\ncomes a-courting here.\" Then she suddenly turned red. \"But if I thought\nhe came after your son's wife that is, or ought to be, I'd soon put him\nto the door.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay; for Heaven's sake let me not make mischief. Poor lad! Why,\ngirl, Fancy will not be bridled, Bless you, I wormed it out of him near\na twelvemonth agone.\"\n\n\"Oh, mother, and you let him?\"\n\n\"Well, I thought of you. I said to myself, 'If he is fool enough to\nbe her slave for nothing, all the better for her. A lone woman is lost\nwithout a man about her to fetch and carry her little matters,' But now\nmy mind is changed, and I think the best use you can put him to is to\nmarry him.\"\n\n\"So then, his own mother is against him, and would wed me to the first\ncomer. An, Gerard, thou hast but me; I will not believe thee dead till\nI see thy tomb, nor false till I see thee with another lover in thine\nhand. Foolish boy, I shall ne'er be civil to him again.\"\n\nAfflicted with the busybody's protection, Luke Peterson met a cold\nreception in the house where he had hitherto found a gentle and kind\none. And by-and-by, finding himself very little spoken to at all, and\nthen sharply and irritably, the great soft fellow fell to whimpering,\nand asked Margaret plump if he had done anything to offend her.\n\n\"Nothing. I am to blame. I am curst. If you will take my counsel you\nwill keep out of my way awhile.\"\n\n\"It is all along of me, Luke,\" said the busybody.\n\n\"You, Mistress Catherine, Why, what have I done for you to set her\nagainst me?\"\n\n\"Nay, I meant all for the best. I told her I saw you were looking\ntowards her through a wedding ring, But she won't hear of it.\"\n\n\"There was no need to tell her that, wife; she knows I am courting her\nthis twelvemonth.\"\n\n\"Not I,\" said Margaret; \"or I should never have opened the street door\nto you.\n\n\"Why, I come here every Saturday night. And that is how the lads in\nRotterdam do court. If we sup with a lass o' Saturdays, that wooing.\"\n\n\"Oh, that is Rotterdam, is it? Then next time you come, let it be\nThursday or Friday. For my part, I thought you came after my puddings,\nboy.\"\n\n\"I like your puddings well enough. You make them better than mother\ndoes, But I like you still better than the puddings,\" said Luke\ntenderly.\n\n\"Then you have seen the last of them. How dare you talk so to another\nman's wife, and him far away?\" She ended gently, but very firmly, \"You\nneed not trouble yourself to come here any more, Luke; I can carry my\nbasket myself.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well,\" said Luke; and after sitting silent and stupid for a\nlittle while, he rose, and said sadly to Catherine, \"Dame, I daresay I\nhave got the sack;\" and went out.\n\nBut the next Saturday Catherine found him seated on the doorstep\nblubbering. He told her he had got used to come there, and every other\nplace seemed strange. She went in, and told Margaret; and Margaret\nsighed, and said, \"Poor Luke, he might come in for her, if he could\nknow his place, and treat her like a married wife.\" On this being\ncommunicated to Luke, he hesitated, \"Pshaw!\" said Catherine, \"promises\nare pie-crusts. Promise her all the world, sooner than sit outside\nlike a fool, when a word will carry you inside, now you humour her in\neverything, and then, if Poor Gerard come not home and claim her, you\nwill be sure to have her--in time. A lone woman is aye to be tired out,\nthou foolish boy.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXX\n\nTHE CLOISTER\n\nBrother Clement had taught and preached in Basle more than a\ntwelvemonth, when one day Jerome stood before him, dusty, with a\ntriumphant glance in his eye.\n\n\"Give the glory to God, Brother Clement; thou canst now wend to England\nwith me.\"\n\n\"I am ready, Brother Jerome; and expecting thee these many months, have\nin the intervals of teaching and devotion studied the English tongue\nsomewhat closely.\"\n\n\"'Twas well thought of,\" said Jerome. He then told him he had but\ndelayed till he could obtain extraordinary powers from the Pope to\ncollect money for the Church's use in England, and to hear confession\nin all the secular monasteries. \"So now gird up thy loins, and let us go\nforth and deal a good blow for the Church, and against the Franciscans.\"\n\nThe two friars went preaching down the Rhine for England. In the larger\nplaces they both preached. At the smaller they often divided, and took\ndifferent sides of the river, and met again at some appointed spot. Both\nwere able orators, but in different styles.\n\nJerome's was noble and impressive, but a little contracted in religious\ntopics, and a trifle monotonous in delivery compared with Clement's,\nthough in truth not so, compared with most preachers.\n\nClement's was full of variety, and often remarkably colloquial. In its\ngeneral flow, tender and gently winning, it curled round the reason and\nthe heart. But it always rose with the rising thought; and so at times\nClement soared as far above Jerome as his level speaking was below him.\nIndeed, in these noble heats he was all that we hue read of inspired\nprophet or heathen orator: Vehemens ut procella, excitatus ut torrens,\nincensus ut fulmen, tonabat, fulgurabat, et rapidis eloquentiae\nfiuctibus cuncta proruebat et perturbabat.\n\nI would give literal specimens, but for five objections; it is\ndifficult; time is short; I have done it elsewhere; an able imitator\nhas since done it better and similarity, a virtue in peas, is a vice in\nbooks.\n\nBut (not to evade the matter entirely) Clement used secretly to try and\nlearn the recent events and the besetting sin of each town he was to\npreach in.\n\nBut Jerome, the unbending, scorned to go out of his way for any people's\nvices. At one great town, some leagues from the Rhine, they mounted\nthe same pulpit in turn. Jerome preached against vanity in dress, a\nfavourite theme of his. He was eloquent and satirical, and the people\nlistened with complacency. It was a vice that they were little given to.\n\nClement preached against drunkenness. It was a besetting sin, and sacred\nfrom preaching in these parts: for the clergy themselves were infected\nwith it, and popular prejudice protected it, Clement dealt it merciless\nblows out of Holy Writ and worldly experience. A crime itself, it was\nthe nursing mother of most crimes, especially theft and murder. He\nreminded them of a parricide that had lately been committed in their\ntown by all honest man in liquor; and also how a band of drunkards had\nroasted one of their own comrades alive at a neighbouring village. \"Your\nlast prince,\" said he, \"is reported to have died of apoplexy, but well\nyou know he died of drink; and of your aldermen one perished miserably\nlast month dead drunk, suffocated in a puddle. Your children's backs go\nbare that you may fill your bellies with that which makes you the\nworst of beasts, silly as calves, yet fierce as boars; and drives your\nfamilies to need, and your souls to hell. I tell ye your town, ay, and\nyour very nation, would sink to the bottom of mankind did your women\ndrink as you do. And how long will they be temperate, and contrary to\nnature, resist the example of their husbands and fathers? Vice ne'er\nyet stood still. Ye must amend yourselves, or see them come down to\nyour mark, Already in Bohemia they drink along with the men. How shows\na drunken woman? Would you love to see your wives drunken, your mothers\ndrunken?\" At this there was a shout of horror, for mediaeval audiences\nhad not learned to sit mumchance at a moving sermon. \"Ah, that comes\nhome to you,\" cried the friar. \"What madmen! think you it doth not\nmore shock the all-pure God to see a man, His noblest work, turned to\na drunken beast, than it can shock you creatures of sin and unreason to\nsee a woman turned into a thing no better nor worse than yourselves.\"\n\nHe ended with two pictures: a drunkard's house and family, and a sober\nman's; both so true and dramatic in all their details that the wives\nfell all to \"ohing\" and \"ahing,\" and \"Eh, but that is a true word.\"\n\nThis discourse caused quite all uproar. The hearers formed knots; the\nmen were indignant; so the women flattered them and took their part\nopenly against the preacher. A married man had a right to a drop; he\nneeded it, working for all the family. And for their part they did not\ncare to change their men for milksops.\n\nThe double faces! That very evening a hand of men caught near a hundred\nof them round Brother Clement, filling his wallet with the best, and\noffering him the very roses off their heads, and kissing his frock, and\nblessing him \"for taking in hand to mend their sots.\"\n\nJerome thought this sermon too earthly.\n\n\"Drunkenness is not heresy, Clement, that a whole sermon should be\npreached against it.\"\n\nAs they went on, he found to his surprise that Clement's sermons sank\ninto his hearers deeper than his own; made them listen, think, cry, and\nsometimes even amend their ways. \"He hath the art of sinking to their\npeg,\" thought Jerome, \"Yet he can soar high enough at times.\"\n\nUpon the whole it puzzled Jerome, who had a secret sense of superiority\nto his tenderer brother. And after about two hundred miles of it, it\ngot to displease him as well as puzzle him. But he tried to check this\nsentiment as petty and unworthy. \"Souls differ like locks,\" said he,\n\"and preachers must differ like keys, or the fewer should the Church\nopen for God to pass in. And certes, this novice hath the key to these\nnorthern souls, being himself a northern man.\"\n\nAnd so they came slowly down the Rhine, sometimes drifting a few miles\ndown the stream; but in general walking by the banks preaching, and\nteaching, and confessing sinners in the towns and villages; and they\nreached the town of Dusseldorf.\n\nThere was the little quay where Gerard and Denys had taken boat up the\nRhine, The friars landed on it. There were the streets, there was\n\"The Silver Lion.\" Nothing had changed but he, who walked through it\nbarefoot, with his heart calm and cold, his hands across his breast,\nand his eyes bent meekly on the ground, a true son of Dominic and Holy\nChurch.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXI\n\nTHE HEARTH\n\n\"Eli,\" said Catherine, \"answer me one question like a man, and I'll ask\nno more to-day. What is wormwood?\"\n\nEli looked a little helpless at this sudden demand upon his faculties;\nbut soon recovered enough to say it was something that tasted main\nbitter.\n\n\"That is a fair answer, my man, but not the one I look for.\"\n\n\"Then answer it yourself.\"\n\n\"And shall. Wormwood is--to have two in the house a-doing nought, but\nwaiting for thy shoes and mine,\" Eli groaned. The shaft struck home.\n\n\"Methinks waiting for their best friend's coffin, that and nothing to\ndo, are enow to make them worse than Nature meant. Why not set them up\nsomewhere, to give 'em a chance?\"\n\nEli said he was willing, but afraid they would drink and gamble their\nvery shelves away.\n\n\"Nay,\" said Catherine, \"Dost take me for a simpleton? Of course I mean\nto watch them at starting, and drive them wi' a loose rein, as the\nsaying is.\"\n\n\"Where did you think of? Not here; to divide our own custom.\"\n\n\"Not likely. I say Rotterdam against the world. Then I could start\nthem.\"\n\nOh, self-deception! The true motive of all this was to get near little\nGerard.\n\nAfter many discussions and eager promises of amendment on these terms\nfrom Cornelis and Sybrandt, Catherine went to Rotterdam shop-hunting,\nand took Kate with her; for a change, They soon found one, and in a good\nstreet; but it was sadly out of order. However, they got it cheaper for\nthat, and instantly set about brushing it up, fitting proper shelves for\nthe business, and making the dwelling-house habitable.\n\n\nLuke Peterson was always asking Margaret what he could do for her. The\nanswer used to be in a sad tone, \"Nothing, Luke, nothing.\"\n\n\"What, you that are so clever, can you think of nothing for me to do for\nyou?\"\n\n\"Nothing, Luke, nothing.\"\n\nBut at last she varied the reply thus: \"If you could make something to\nhelp my sweet sister Kate about.\"\n\nThe slave of love consented joyfully, and soon made Kate a little cart,\nand cushioned it, and yoked himself into it, and at eventide drew her\nout of the town, and along the pleasant boulevard, with Margaret and\nCatherine walking beside. It looked a happier party than it was.\n\nKate, for one, enjoyed it keenly, for little Gerard was put in her\nlap, and she doted on him; and it was like a cherub carried by a little\nangel, or a rosebud lying in the cup of a lily.\n\nSo the vulgar jeered; and asked Luke how a thistle tasted, and if his\nmistress could not afford one with four legs, etc.\n\nLuke did not mind these jeers; but Kate minded them for him.\n\n\"Thou hast made the cart for me, good Luke,\" said she, \"'Twas much. I\ndid ill to let thee draw me too; we can afford to pay some poor soul for\nthat. I love my rides, and to carry little Gerard; but I'd liever ride\nno more than thou be mocked fort.\"\n\n\"Much I care for their tongues,\" said Luke; \"if I did care I'd knock\ntheir heads together. I shall draw you till my mistress says give over.\n\n\"Luke, if you obey Kate, you will oblige me.\"\n\n\"Then I will obey Kate.\"\n\nAn honourable exception to popular humour was Jorian Ketel's wife. \"That\nis strength well laid out, to draw the weak. And her prayers will be\nyour guerdon; she is not long for this world; she smileth in pain.\"\nThese were the words of Joan.\n\nSingle-minded Luke answered that he did not want the poor lass's prayers\nhe did it to please his mistress, Margaret.\n\nAfter that Luke often pressed Margaret to give him something to\ndo--without success.\n\nBut one day, as if tired with his importuning, she turned on him, and\nsaid with a look and accent I should in vain try to convey:\n\n\"Find me my boy's father.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXII\n\n\"Mistress, they all say he is dead.\"\n\n\"Not so. They feed me still with hopes.\"\n\n\"Ay, to your face, but behind your back they all say he is dead.\"\n\nAt this revelation Margaret's tears began to flow'.\n\nLuke whimpered for company. He had the body of a man but the heart of a\ngirl.\n\n\"Prithee, weep not so, sweet mistress,\" said he. \"I'd bring him back to\nlife an I could, rather than see thee weed so sore.\"\n\nMargaret said she thought she was weeping because they were so\ndouble-tongued with her.\n\nShe recovered herself, and laying her hand on his shoulder, said\nsolemnly, \"Luke, he is not dead. Dying men are known to have a strange\nsight. And listen, Luke! My poor father, when he was a-dying, and I,\nsimple fool, was so happy, thinking he was going to get well altogether,\nhe said to mother and me--he was sitting in that very chair where you\nare now, and mother was as might be here, and I was yonder making a\nsleeve--said he, 'I see him!' I see him! Just so. Not like a failing man\nat all, but all o' fire. 'Sore disfigured-on a great river-coming this\nway.'\n\n\"Ah, Luke, if you were a woman, and had the feeling for me you think you\nhave, you would pity me, and find him for me. Take a thought! The father\nof my child!\"\n\n\"Alack, I would if I knew how,\" said Luke, \"but how can I?\"\n\n\"Nay, of course you cannot. I am mad to think it. But oh, if any one\nreally cared for me, they would; that is all I know.\"\n\nLuke reflected in silence for some time.\n\n\"The old folk all say dying men can see more than living wights. Let me\nthink: for my mind cannot gallop like thine. On a great river Well, the\nMaas is a great river.\" He pondered on.\n\n\"Coming this way? Then if it 'twas the Maas, he would have been here\nby this time, so 'tis not the Maas. The Rhine is a great river, greater\nthan the Maas; and very long. I think it will be the Rhine.\"\n\n\"And so do I, Luke; for Denys bade him come down the Rhine. But even if\nit is, he may turn off before he comes anigh his birthplace. He does not\npine for me as I for him; that is clear. Luke, do you not think he has\ndeserted me?\" She wanted him to contradict her, but he said, \"It looks\nvery like it; what a fool he must be!\"\n\n\"What do we know?\" objected Margaret imploringly.\n\n\"Let me think again,\" said Luke. \"I cannot gallop.\"\n\nThe result of this meditation was this. He knew a station about sixty\nmiles up the Rhine, where all the public boats put in; and he would go\nto that station, and try and cut the truant off. To be sure he did not\neven know him by sight; but as each boat came in he would mingle with\nthe passengers, and ask if one Gerard was there. \"And, mistress, if you\nwere to give me a bit of a letter to him; for, with us being strangers,\nmayhap a won't believe a word I say.\"\n\n\"Good, kind, thoughtful Luke, I will (how I have undervalued thee!).\nBut give me till supper-time to get it writ.\" At supper she put a letter\ninto his hand with a blush; it was a long letter, tied round with silk\nafter the fashion of the day, and sealed over the knot.\n\nLuke weighed it in his hand, with a shade of discontent, and said to her\nvery gravely, \"Say your father was not dreaming, and say I have the luck\nto fall in with this man, and say he should turn out a better bit of\nstuff than I think him, and come home to you then and there--what is to\nbecome o' me?\"\n\nMargaret coloured to her very brow. \"Oh, Luke, Heaven will reward thee.\nAnd I shall fall on my knees and bless thee; and I shall love thee all\nmy days, sweet Luke, as a mother does her son. I am so old by thee:\ntrouble ages the heart. Thou shalt not go 'tis not fair of me. Love\nmaketh us to be all self.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" said Luke. \"And if,\" resumed he, in the same grave way, \"yon\nscapegrace shall read thy letter, and hear me tell him how thou pinest\nfor him, and yet, being a traitor, or a mere idiot, will not turn to\nthee what shall become of me then? Must I die a bachelor, and thou fare\nlonely to thy grave, neither maid, wife, nor widow?\"\n\nMargaret panted with fear and emotion at this terrible piece of good\nsense, and the plain question which followed it. But at last she\nfaltered out, \"If, which our Lady be merciful to me, and forbid--Oh!\"\n\n\"Well, mistress?\"\n\n\"If he should read my letter, and hear thy words--and, sweet Luke, be\njust and tell him what a lovely babe he hath, fatherless, fatherless.\nOh, Luke, can he be so cruel?\"\n\n\"I trow not but if?\"\n\n\"Then he will give thee up my marriage lines, and I shall be an honest\nwoman, and a wretched one, and my boy will not be a bastard; and of\ncourse, then we could both go into any honest man's house that would\nbe troubled with us; and even for thy goodness this day, I will--I\nwill--ne'er be so ungrateful as go past thy door to another man's.\"\n\n\"Ay, but will you come in at mine? Answer me that!\"\n\n\"Oh, ask me not! Some day, perhaps, when my wounds leave bleeding. Alas,\nI'll try. If I don't fling myself and my child into the Maas. Do not go,\nLuke! do not think of going! 'Tis all madness from first to last.\"\n\nBut Luke was as slow to forego an idea as to form one.\n\nHis reply showed how fast love was making a man of him. \"Well,\" said he,\n\"madness is something, anyway; and I am tired of doing nothing for thee;\nand I am no great talker. To-morrow, at peep of day, I start. But hold,\nI have no money. My mother, she takes care of all mine; and I ne'er see\nit again.\"\n\nThen Margaret took out Catherine's gold angel, which had escaped so\noften, and gave it to Luke; and he set out on his mad errand.\n\nIt did not, however, seem so mad to him as to us. It was a superstitious\nage; and Luke acted on the dying man's dream, or vision, or illusion, or\nwhatever it was, much as we should act on respectable information.\n\nBut Catherine was downright angry when she heard of it, \"To send the\npoor lad on such a wild-goose chase! But you are like a many more\ngirls; and mark my words; by the time you have worn that Luke fairly\nout, and made him as sick of you as a dog, you will turn as fond on him\nas a cow on a calf, and 'Too late' will be the cry.\"\n\n\nTHE CLOISTER\n\nThe two friars reached Holland from the south just twelve hours after\nLuke started up the Rhine.\n\nThus, wild-goose chase or not, the parties were nearing each other, and\nrapidly too. For Jerome, unable to preach in low Dutch, now began\nto push on towards the coast, anxious to get to England as soon as\npossible.\n\nAnd having the stream with them, the friars would in point of fact have\nmissed Luke by passing him in full stream below his station, but for the\nincident which I am about to relate.\n\nAbout twenty miles above the station Luke was making for, Clement landed\nto preach in a large village; and towards the end of his sermon he\nnoticed a grey nun weeping.\n\nHe spoke to her kindly, and asked her what was her grief.\n\n\"Nay,\" said she, \"'tis not for myself flow these tears; 'tis for my lost\nfriend. Thy words reminded me of what she was, and what she is, poor\nwretch, But you are a Dominican, and I am a Franciscan nun.\"\n\n\"It matters little, my sister, if we are both Christians, and if I can\naid thee in aught.\"\n\nThe nun looked in his face, and said, \"These are strange words, but\nmethinks they are good; and thy lips are oh, most eloquent, I will tell\nthee our grief.\"\n\nShe then let him know that a young nun, the darling of the convent, and\nher bosom friend, had been lured away from her vows, and after various\ngradations of sin, was actually living in a small inn as chambermaid,\nin reality as a decoy, and was known to be selling her favours to the\nwealthier customers, She added, \"Anywhere else we might, by kindly\nviolence, force her away from perdition, But this innkeeper was the\nservant of the fierce baron on the height there, and hath his ear still,\nand he would burn our convent to the ground, were we to take her by\nforce.\"\n\n\"Moreover, souls will not be saved by brute force,\" said Clement.\n\nWhile they were talking Jerome came up, and Clement persuaded him to lie\nat the convent that night, But when in the morning Clement told him he\nhad had a long talk with the abbess, and that she was very sad, and he\nhad promised her to try and win back her nun, Jerome objected, and said,\n\"It was not their business, and was a waste of time,\" Clement, however,\nwas no longer a mere pupil. He stood firm, and at last they agreed that\nJerome should go forward, and secure their passage in the next ship for\nEngland, and Clement be allowed time to make his well-meant but idle\nexperiment.\n\nAbout ten o'clock that day, a figure in a horseman's cloak, and great\nboots to match, and a large flapping felt hat, stood like a statue near\nthe auberge, where was the apostate nun, Mary. The friar thus disguised\nwas at that moment truly wretched. These ardent natures undertake\nwonders; but are dashed when they come hand to hand with the sickening\ndifficulties. But then, as their hearts are steel, though their nerves\nare anything but iron, they turn not back, but panting and dispirited,\nstruggle on to the last.\n\nClement hesitated long at the door, prayed for help and wisdom, and at\nlast entered the inn and sat down faint at heart, and with his body in a\ncold perspiration, But inside he was another man. He called lustily for\na cup of wine: it was brought him by the landlord, He paid for it with\nmoney the convent had supplied him; and made a show of drinking it.\n\n\"Landlord,\" said he, \"I hear there is a fair chambermaid in thine\nhouse.\"\n\n\"Ay, stranger, the buxomest in Holland. But she gives not her company to\nall comers only to good customers.\"\n\nFriar Clement dangled a massive gold chain in the landlord's sight. He\nlaughed, and shouted, \"Here, Janet, here is a lover for thee would\nbind thee in chains of gold; and a tall lad into the bargain, I promise\nthee.\"\n\n\"Then I am in double luck,\" said a female voice; \"send him hither.\"\n\nClement rose, shuddered, and passed into the room, where Janet was\nseated playing with a piece of work, and laying it down every minute, to\nsing a mutilated fragment of a song. For, in her mode of life, she had\nnot the patience to carry anything out.\n\nAfter a few words of greeting, the disguised visitor asked her if they\ncould not be more private somewhere.\n\n\"Why not?\" said she. And she rose and smiled, and went tripping before\nhim, He followed, groaning inwardly, and sore perplexed.\n\n\"There,\" said she. \"Have no fear! Nobody ever comes here, but such as\npay for the privilege.\"\n\nClement looked round the room, and prayed silently for wisdom. Then he\nwent softly, and closed the window-shutters carefully.\n\n\"What on earth is that for?\" said Janet, in some uneasiness.\n\n\"Sweetheart,\" whispered the visitor, with a mysterious air, \"it is that\nGod may not see us.\n\n\"Madman,\" said Janet; \"think you a wooden shutter can keep out His eye?\"\n\n\"Nay, I know not. Perchance He has too much on hand to notice us, But I\nwould not the saints and angels should see us. Would you?\"\n\n\"My poor soul, hope not to escape their sight! The only way is not to\nthink of them; for if you do, it poisons your cup. For two pins I'd run\nand leave thee. Art pleasant company in sooth.\"\n\n\"After all, girl, so that men see us not, what signify God and the\nsaints seeing us? Feel this chain! 'Tis virgin gold. I shall cut two of\nthese heavy links off for thee.\"\n\n\"Ah! now thy discourse is to the point,\" And she handled the chain\ngreedily. \"Why, 'tis as massy as the chain round the virgin's neck at\nthe conv--\" She did not finish the word.\n\n\"Whisht! whisht! whisht! 'Tis it. And thou shalt have thy share. But\nbetray me not.\"\n\n\"Monster!\" cried Janet, drawing back from him with repugnance; \"what,\nrob the blessed Virgin of her chain, and give it to an--\"\n\n\"You are none,\" cried Clement exultingly, \"or you had not recked for\nthat-Mary!\"\n\n\"Ah! ah! ah!\"\n\n\"Thy patron saint, whose chain this is, sends me to greet thee\"\n\nShe ran screaming to the window and began to undo the shutters.\n\nHer fingers trembled, and Clement had time to debarass himself of his\nboots and his hat before the light streamed in upon him, He then let his\ncloak quietly fall, and stood before her, a Dominican friar, calm and\nmajestic as a statue, and held his crucifix towering over her with a\nloving, sad, and solemn look, that somehow relieved her of the physical\npart of fear, but crushed her with religious terror and remorse. She\ncrouched and cowered against the wall.\n\n\"Mary,\" said he gently; \"one word! Are you happy?\"\n\n\"As happy as I shall be in hell.\"\n\n\"And they are not happy at the convent; they weep for you.\"\n\n\"For me?\"\n\n\"Day and night; above all, the Sister Ursula.\"\n\n\"Poor Ursula!\" And the strayed nun began to weep herself at the thought\nof her friend.\n\n\"The angels weep still more. Wilt not dry all their tears in earth and\nheaven and save thyself?\"\n\n\"Ay! would I could; but it is too late.\"\n\n\"Satan avaunt,\" cried the monk sternly. \"'Tis thy favourite temptation;\nand thou, Mary, listen not to the enemy of man, belying God, and\nwhispering despair. I who come to save thee have been a far greater\nsinner than thou. Come, Mary, sin, thou seest, is not so sweet, e'n in\nthis world, as holiness; and eternity is at the door.\"\n\n\"How can they ever receive me again?\"\n\n\"'Tis their worthiness thou doubtest now. But in truth they pine for\nthee. 'Twas in pity of their tears that I, a Dominican, undertook this\ntask; and broke the rule of my order by entering an inn; and broke it\nagain by donning these lay vestments. But all is well done, and quit for\na light penance, if thou wilt let us rescue thy soul from this den of\nwolves, and bring thee back to thy vows.\"\n\nThe nun gazed at him with tears in her eyes. \"And thou, a Dominican,\nhast done this for a daughter of St. Francis! Why, the Franciscans and\nDominicans hate one another.\"\n\n\"Ay, my daughter; but Francis and Dominic love one another.\"\n\nThe recreant nun seemed struck and affected by this answer\n\nClement now reminded her how shocked she had been that the Virgin should\nbe robbed of her chain. \"But see now,\" said he, \"the convent, and\nthe Virgin too, think ten times more of their poor nun than of golden\nchains; for they freely trusted their chain to me a stranger, that\nperadventure the sight of it might touch their lost Mary and remind her\nof their love,\" Finally he showed her with such terrible simplicity the\nend of her present course, and on the other hand so revived her dormant\nmemories and better feelings, that she kneeled sobbing at his feet, and\nowned she had never known happiness nor peace since she betrayed her\nvows; and said she would go back if he would go with her; but alone\nshe dared not, could not: even if she reached the gate she could never\nenter. How could she face the abbess and the sisters? He told her he\nwould go with her as joyfully as the shepherd bears a strayed lamb to\nthe fold.\n\nBut when he urged her to go at once, up sprung a crop of those\nprodigiously petty difficulties that entangle her sex, like silken nets,\nliker iron cobwebs.\n\nHe quietly swept them aside.\n\n\"But how can I walk beside thee in this habit?\"\n\n\"I have brought the gown and cowl of thy holy order. Hide thy bravery\nwith them. And leave thy shoes as I leave these\" (pointing to his\nhorseman's boots).\n\nShe collected her jewels and ornaments.\n\n\"What are these for?\" inquired Clement.\n\n\"To present to the convent, father.\"\n\n\"Their source is too impure.\"\n\n\"But,\" objected the penitent, \"it would be a sin to leave them here.\nThey can be sold to feed the poor.\"\n\n\"Mary, fix thine eye on this crucifix, and trample those devilish\nbaubles beneath thy feet.\"\n\nShe hesitated; but soon threw them down and trampled on them.\n\n\"Now open the window and fling them out on that dunghill. 'Tis well\ndone. So pass the wages of sin from thy hands, its glittering yoke from\nthy neck, its pollution from thy soul. Away, daughter of St. Francis, we\ntarry in this vile place too long.\" She followed him.\n\nBut they were not clear yet.\n\nAt first the landlord was so astounded at seeing a black friar and a\ngrey nun pass through his kitchen from the inside, that he gaped, and\nmuttered, \"Why, what mummery is this?\" But he soon comprehended the\nmatter, and whipped in between the fugitives and the door. \"What ho!\nReuben! Carl! Gavin! here is a false friar spiriting away our Janet.\"\n\nThe men came running in with threatening looks. The friar rushed at them\ncrucifix in hand. \"Forbear,\" he cried, in a stentorian voice. \"She is\na holy nun returning to her vows. The hand that touches her cowl or her\nrobe to stay her, it shall wither, his body shall lie unburied, cursed\nby Rome, and his soul shall roast in eternal fire.\" They shrank back as\nif a flame had met them. \"And thou--miserable panderer!\"\n\nHe did not end the sentence in words, but seized the man by the neck,\nand strong as a lion in his moments of hot excitement, hurled him\nfuriously from the door and sent him all across the room, pitching head\nforemost on to the stone floor; then tore the door open and carried the\nscreaming nun out into the road.\n\n\"Hush! poor trembler,\" he gasped; \"they dare not molest thee on the\nhighroad. Away!\"\n\nThe landlord lay terrified, half stunned, and bleeding; and Mary, though\nshe often looked back apprehensively, saw no more of him.\n\nOn the road he bade her observe his impetuosity.\n\n\"Hitherto,\" said he, \"we have spoken of thy faults: now for mine. My\ncholer is ungovernable; furious. It is by the grace of God I am not a\nmurderer, I repent the next moment; but a moment too late is all too\nlate. Mary, had the churls laid finger on thee, I should have scattered\ntheir brains with my crucifix, Oh, I know myself; go to; and tremble at\nmyself. There lurketh a wild beast beneath this black gown of mine.\"\n\n\"Alas, father,\" said Mary, \"were you other than you are I had been lost.\nTo take me from that place needed a man wary as a fox; yet bold as a\nlion.\"\n\nClement reflected. \"This much is certain: God chooseth well his fleshly\ninstruments; and with imperfect hearts doeth His perfect work, Glory be\nto God!\"\n\nWhen they were near the convent Mary suddenly stopped, and seized the\nfriar's arm, and began to cry. He looked at her kindly, and told her she\nhad nothing to fear. It would be the happiest day she had ever spent.\nHe then made her sit down and compose herself till he should return, He\nentered the convent, and desired to see the abbess.\n\n\"My sister, give the glory to God: Mary is at the gate.\"\n\nThe astonishment and delight of the abbess were unbounded.\n\nShe yielded at once to Clement's earnest request that the road of\npenitence might be smoothed at first to this unstable wanderer, and\nafter some opposition, she entered heartily into his views as to her\nactual reception. To give time for their little preparations Clement\nwent slowly back, and seating himself by Mary soothed her; and heard her\nconfession.\n\n\"The abbess has granted me that you shall propose your own penance.\"\n\n\"It shall be none the lighter,\" said she.\n\n\"I trow not,\" said he; \"but that is future: to-day is given to joy\nalone.\"\n\nHe then led her round the building to the abbess's postern.\n\nAs they went they heard musical instruments and singing.\n\n\"'Tis a feastday,\" said Mary; \"and I come to mar it.\"\n\n\"Hardly,\" said Clement, smiling; \"seeing that you are the queen of the\nfete.\"\n\n\"I, father? what mean you?\"\n\n\"What, Mary, have you never heard that there is more joy in heaven over\none sinner that repenteth, than over ninety-nine just persons which need\nno repentance? Now this convent is not heaven; nor the nuns angels; yet\nare there among then, some angelic spirits; and these sing and exult\nat thy return. But here methinks comes one of them; for I see her hand\ntrembles at the keyhole.\"\n\nThe postern was flung open, and in a moment Sister Ursula clung sobbing\nand kissing round her friend's neck. The abbess followed more sedately,\nbut little less moved.\n\nClement bade them farewell. They entreated him to stay; but he told them\nwith much regret he could not. He had already tried his good Brother\nJerome's patience, and must hasten to the river; and perhaps sail for\nEngland to-morrow.\n\nSo Mary returned to the fold, and Clement strode briskly on towards the\nRhine, and England.\n\nThis was the man for whom Margaret's boy lay in wait with her letter.\n\n\nTHE HEARTH\n\nAnd that letter was one of those simple, touching appeals only her sex\ncan write to those who have used them cruelly, and they love them. She\nbegan by telling him of the birth of the little boy, and the comfort he\nhad been to her in all the distress of mind his long and strange silence\nhad caused her. She described the little Gerard minutely, not forgetting\nthe mole on his little finger.\n\n\"Know you any one that hath the like on his? If you only saw him you\ncould not choose but be proud of him; all the mothers in the street do\nenvy me; but I the wives; for thou comest not to us. My own Gerard, some\nsay thou art dead. But if thou wert dead, how could I be alive? Others\nsay that thou, whom I love so truly, art false. But this will I believe\nfrom no lips but thine. My father loved thee well; and as he lay a-dying\nhe thought he saw thee on a great river, with thy face turned towards\nthy Margaret, but sore disfigured. Is't so, perchance? Have cruel men\nscarred thy sweet face? or hast thou lost one of thy precious limbs?\nWhy, then thou hast the more need of me, and I shall love thee not\nworse, alas! thinkest thou a woman's love is light as a man's? but\nbetter, than I did when I shed those few drops from my arm, not worth\nthe tears, thou didst shed for them; mindest thou? 'tis not so very long\nagone, dear Gerard.\"\n\nThe letter continued in this strain, and concluded without a word of\nreproach or doubt as to his faith and affection. Not that she was free\nfrom most distressing doubts; but they were not certainties; and to show\nthem might turn the scale, and frighten him away from her with fear of\nbeing scolded. And of this letter she made soft Luke the bearer.\n\nSo she was not an angel after all.\n\nLuke mingled with the passengers of two boats, and could hear nothing of\nGerard Eliassoen. Nor did this surprise him.\n\nHe was more surprised when, at the third attempt, a black friar said\nto him, somewhat severely, \"And what would you with him you call Gerard\nEliassoen?\"\n\n\"Why, father, if he is alive I have got a letter for him.\"\n\n\"Humph!\" said Jerome. \"I am sorry for it, However, the flesh is weak.\nWell, my son, he you seek will be here by the next boat, or the next\nboat after. And if he chooses to answer to that name--After all, I am\nnot the keeper of his conscience.\"\n\n\"Good father, one plain word, for Heaven's sake, This Gerard Eliassoen\nof Tergou--is he alive?\"\n\n\"Humph! Why, certes, he that went by that name is alive.\"\n\n\"Well, then, that is settled,\" said Luke drily. But the next moment he\nfound it necessary to run out of sight and blubber.\n\n\"Oh, why did the Lord make any women?\" said he to himself. \"I was\ncontent with the world till I fell in love. Here his little finger is\nmore to her than my whole body, and he is not dead, And here I have got\nto give him this.\" He looked at the letter and dashed it on the ground.\nBut he picked it up again with a spiteful snatch, and went to the\nlandlord, with tears in his eyes, and begged for work, The landlord\ndeclined, said he had his own people.\n\n\"Oh, I seek not your money,\" said Luke, \"I only want some work to keep\nme from breaking my heart about another man's lass.\"\n\n\"Good lad! good lad!\" exploded the landlord; and found him lots of\nbarrels to mend--on these terms, And he coopered with fury in the\ninterval of the boats coming down the Rhine.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXIII\n\nTHE HEARTH\n\nWaiting an earnest letter seldom leaves the mind in statu quo.\n\nMargaret, in hers, vented her energy and her faith in her dying father's\nvision, or illusion; and when this was done, and Luke gone, she wondered\nat her credulity, and her conscience pricked her about Luke; and\nCatherine came and scolded her, and she paid the price of false hopes,\nand elevation of spirits, by falling into deeper despondency. She was\nfound in this state by a staunch friend she had lately made, Joan Ketel.\nThis good woman came in radiant with an idea.\n\n\"Margaret, I know the cure for thine ill: the hermit of Gouda a wondrous\nholy man, Why, he can tell what is coming, when he is in the mood.\"\n\n\"Ay, I have heard of him,\" said Margaret hopelessly. Joan with some\ndifficulty persuaded her to walk out as far as Gouda, and consult the\nhermit. They took some butter and eggs in a basket, and went to his\ncave.\n\nWhat had made the pair such fast friends? Jorian some six weeks ago fell\nill of a bowel disease; it began with raging pain; and when this went\noff, leaving him weak, an awkward symptom succeeded; nothing, either\nliquid or solid, would stay in his stomach a minute. The doctor said:\n\"He must die if this goes on many hours; therefore boil thou now a\nchicken with a golden angel in the water, and let him sup that!\"\nAlas! Gilt chicken broth shared the fate of the humbler viands, its\npredecessors. Then the cure steeped the thumb of St. Sergius in beef\nbroth. Same result. Then Joan ran weeping to Margaret to borrow some\nlinen to make his shroud. \"Let me see him,\" said Margaret. She came in\nand felt his pulse. \"Ah!\" said she, \"I doubt they have not gone to the\nroot. Open the window! Art stifling him; now change all his linen.\n\n\"Alack, woman, what for? Why foul more linen for a dying man?\" objected\nthe mediaeval wife.\n\n\"Do as thou art bid,\" said Margaret dully, and left the room.\n\nJoan somehow found herself doing as she was bid. Margaret returned with\nher apron full of a flowering herb. She made a decoction, and took it\nto the bedside; and before giving it to the patient, took a spoonful\nherself, and smacked her lips hypocritically. \"That is fair,\" said he,\nwith a feeble attempt at humour. \"Why, 'tis sweet, and now 'tis bitter.\"\nShe engaged him in conversation as soon as he had taken it. This\nbitter-sweet stayed by him. Seeing which she built on it as cards are\nbuilt: mixed a very little schiedam in the third spoonful, and a little\nbeaten yoke of egg in the seventh. And so with the patience of her sex\nshe coaxed his body out of Death's grasp; and finally, Nature, being\npatted on the back, instead of kicked under the bed, set Jorian Ketel\non his legs again. But the doctress made them both swear never to tell a\nsoul her guilty deed. \"They would put me in prison, away from my child.\"\n\nThe simple that saved Jorian was called sweet feverfew. She gathered it\nin his own garden. Her eagle eye had seen it growing out of the window.\n\nMargaret and Joan, then, reached the hermit's cave, and placed their\npresent on the little platform. Margaret then applied her mouth to the\naperture, made for that purpose, and said: \"Holy hermit, we bring thee\nbutter and eggs of the best; and I, a poor deserted girl, wife, yet no\nwife, and mother of the sweetest babe, come to pray thee tell me whether\nhe is quick or dead, true to his vows or false.\"\n\nA faint voice issued from the cave: \"Trouble me not with the things of\nearth, but send me a holy friar, I am dying.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" cried Margaret. \"Is it e'en so, poor soul? Then let us in to\nhelp thee.\"\n\n\"Saints forbid! Thine is a woman's voice. Send me a holy friar.\"\n\nThey went back as they came. Joan could not help saying, \"Are women imps\no' darkness then, that they must not come anigh a dying bed?\"\n\nBut Margaret was too deeply dejected to say anything. Joan applied rough\nconsolation. But she was not listened to till she said: \"And Jorian will\nspeak out ere long; he is just on the boil, He is very grateful to thee,\nbelieve it.\"\n\n\"Seeing is believing,\" replied Margaret, with quiet bitterness.\n\n\"Not but what he thinks you might have saved him with something more out\no' the common than yon. 'A man of my inches to be cured wi' feverfew,'\nsays he. 'Why, if there is a sorry herb,' says he. 'Why, I was thinking\no' pulling all mine up, says he. I up and told him remedies were none\nthe better for being far-fetched; you and feverfew cured him, when the\ngrand medicines came up faster than they went down. So says I, 'You may\ngo down on your four bones to feverfew.' But indeed, he is grateful at\nbottom; you are all his thought and all his chat. But he sees Gerard's\nfolk coming around ye, and good friends, and he said only last night--\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"He made me vow not to tell ye.\"\n\n\"Prithee, tell me.\"\n\n\"Well, he said: 'An' if I tell what little I know, it won't bring\nhim back, and it will set them all by the ears. I wish I had more\nheadpiece,' said he; 'I am sore perplexed. But least said is soonest\nmended.' Yon is his favourite word; he comes back to't from a mile off.\"\n\nMargaret shook her head. \"Ay, we are wading in deep waters, my poor babe\nand me.\"\n\nIt was Saturday night and no Luke.\n\n\"Poor Luke!\" said Margaret. \"It was very good of him to go on such an\nerrand.\"\n\n\"He is one out of a hundred,\" replied Catherine warmly.\n\n\"Mother, do you think he would be kind to little Gerard?\"\n\n\"I am sure he would. So do you be kinder to him when he comes back! Will\nye now?\"\n\n\"Ay.\"\n\n\nTHE CLOISTER\n\nBrother Clement, directed by the nuns, avoided a bend in the river, and\nstriding lustily forward, reached a station some miles nearer the coast\nthan that where Luke lay in wait for Gerard Eliassoen. And the next\nmorning he started early, and was in Rotterdam at noon. He made at once\nfor the port, not to keep Jerome waiting.\n\nHe observed several monks of his order on the quay; he went to them;\nbut Jerome was not amongst them. He asked one of them whether Jerome had\narrived? \"Surely, brother, was the reply.\n\n\"Prithee, where is he?\"\n\n\"Where? Why, there!\" said the monk, pointing to a ship in full sail. And\nClement now noticed that all the monks were looking seaward.\n\n\"What, gone without me! Oh, Jerome! Jerome!\" cried he, in a voice of\nanguish. Several of the friars turned round and stared.\n\n\"You must be brother Clement,\" said one of them at length; and on this\nthey kissed him and greeted him with brotherly warmth, and gave him a\nletter Jerome had charged them with for him. It was a hasty scrawl. The\nwriter told him coldly a ship was about to sail for England, and he was\nloth to lose time. He (Clement) might follow if he pleased, but he would\ndo much better to stay behind, and preach to his own country folk. \"Give\nthe glory to God, brother; you have a wonderful power over Dutch hearts;\nbut you are no match for those haughty islanders: you are too tender.\n\n\"Know thou that on the way I met one, who asked me for thee under the\nname thou didst bear in the world. Be on thy guard! Let not the world\ncatch thee again by any silken net, And remember, Solitude, Fasting, and\nPrayer are the sword, spear, and shield of the soul. Farewell.\"\n\nClement was deeply shocked and mortified at this contemptuous desertion,\nand this cold-blooded missive.\n\nHe promised the good monks to sleep at the convent, and to preach\nwherever the prior should appoint for Jerome had raised him to the skies\nas a preacher, and then withdrew abruptly, for he was cut to the quick,\nand wanted to be alone. He asked himself, was there some incurable fault\nin him, repulsive to so true a son of Dominic? Or was Jerome himself\ndevoid of that Christian Love which St. Paul had placed above Faith\nitself? Shipwrecked with him, and saved on the same fragment of the\nwreck: his pupil, his penitent, his son in the Church, and now for four\nhundred miles his fellow-traveller in Christ; and to be shaken off like\ndirt, the first opportunity, with harsh and cold disdain. \"Why worldly\nhearts are no colder nor less trusty than this,\" said he. \"The only\none that ever really loved me lies in a grave hard by. Fly me, fly to\nEngland, man born without a heart; I will go and pray over a grave at\nSevenbergen.\"\n\nThree hours later he passed Peter's cottage. A troop of noisy children\nwere playing about the door, and the house had been repaired, and a\nnew outhouse added. He turned his head hastily away, not to disturb a\npicture his memory treasured; and went to the churchyard.\n\nHe sought among the tombstones for Margaret's. He could not find it.\nHe could not believe they had grudged her a tombstone, so searched the\nchurchyard all over again.\n\n\"Oh poverty! stern poverty! Poor soul, thou wert like me no one was left\nthat loved thee, when Gerard was gone.\"\n\nHe went into the church, and after kissing the steps, prayed long and\nearnestly for the soul of her whose resting-place he could not find.\n\nComing out of the church he saw a very old man looking over the little\nchurchyard gate. He went towards him, and asked him did he live in the\nplace.\n\n\"Four score and twelve years, man and boy. And I come here every day\nof late, holy father, to take a peep. This is where I look to bide ere\nlong.\"\n\n\"My son, can you tell me where Margaret lies?\"\n\n\"Margaret? There's a many Margarets here.\"\n\n\"Margaret Brandt. She was daughter to a learned physician.\"\n\n\"As if I didn't know that,\" said the old man pettishly. \"But she doesn't\nlie here. Bless you, they left this a longful while ago. Gone in a\nmoment, and the house empty. What, is she dead? Margaret a Peter dead?\nNow only think on't. Like enow; like enow, They great towns do terribly\ndisagree wi' country folk.\"\n\n\"What great towns, my son?\"\n\n\"Well, 'twas Rotterdam they went to from here, so I heard tell; or was\nit Amsterdam? Nay, I trow 'twas Rotterdam? And gone there to die!\"\n\nClement sighed.\n\n\"'Twas not in her face now, that I saw. And I can mostly tell, Alack,\nthere was a blooming young flower to be cut off so soon, and all old\nweed like me left standing still. Well, well, she was a May rose yon;\ndear heart, what a winsome smile she had, and--\"\n\n\"God bless thee, my son,\" said Clement; \"farewell!\" and he hurried away.\n\nHe reached the convent at sunset, and watched and prayed in the chapel\nfor Jerome and Margaret till it was long past midnight, and his soul had\nrecovered its cold calm.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXIV\n\nTHE HEARTH\n\nThe next day, Sunday, after mass, was a bustling day at Catherine's\nhouse in the Hoog Straet. The shop was now quite ready, and Cornelis and\nSybrandt were to open it next day; their names were above the door; also\ntheir sign, a white lamb sucking a gilt sheep. Eli had come, and brought\nthem some more goods from his store to give them a good start. The\nhearts of the parents glowed at what they were doing, and the pair\nthemselves walked in the garden together, and agreed they were sick of\ntheir old life, and it was more pleasant to make money than waste it;\nthey vowed to stick to business like wax. Their mother's quick and ever\nwatchful ear overheard this resolution through an open window, and she\ntold Eli, The family supper was to include Margaret and her boy, and be\na kind of inaugural feast, at which good trade advice was to flow from\nthe elders, and good wine to be drunk to the success of the converts\nto Commerce from Agriculture in its unremunerative form--wild oats. So\nMargaret had come over to help her mother-in-law, and also to shake\noff her own deep languor; and both their faces were as red as the fire.\nPresently in came Joan with a salad from Jorian's garden.\n\n\"He cut it for you, Margaret; you are all his chat; I shall be jealous.\nI told him you were to feast to-day. But oh, lass, what a sermon in the\nnew kerk! Preaching? I never heard it till this day.\"\n\n\"Would I had been there then,\" said Margaret; \"for I am dried up for\nwant of dew from heaven.\"\n\n\"Why, he preacheth again this afternoon. But mayhap you are wanted\nhere.\"\n\n\"Not she,\" said Catherine. \"Come, away ye go, if y'are minded.\"\n\n\"Indeed,\" said Margaret, \"methinks I should not be such a damper at\ntable if I could come to 't warm from a good sermon.\"\n\n\"Then you must be brisk,\" observed Joan. \"See the folk are wending that\nway, and as I live, there goes the holy friar. Oh, bless us and save us,\nMargaret; the hermit! We forgot.\" And this active woman bounded out of\nthe house, and ran across the road, and stopped the friar. She returned\nas quickly. \"There, I was bent on seeing him nigh hand.\"\n\n\"What said he to thee?\"\n\n\"Says he, 'My daughter, I will go to him ere sunset, God willing.' The\nsweetest voice. But oh, my mistresses, what thin cheeks for a young man,\nand great eyes, not far from your colour, Margaret.\"\n\n\"I have a great mind to go hear him,\" said Margaret. \"But my cap is not\nvery clean, and they will all be there in their snow-white mutches.\"\n\n\"There, take my handkerchief out of the basket,\" said Catherine; \"you\ncannot have the child, I want him for my poor Kate. It is one of her ill\ndays.\"\n\nMargaret replied by taking the boy upstairs. She found Kate in bed.\n\n\"How art thou, sweetheart? Nay, I need not ask. Thou art in sore pain;\nthou smilest so, See,' I have brought thee one thou lovest.\"\n\n\"Two, by my way of counting,\" said Kate, with an angelic smile. She had\na spasm at that moment would have made some of us roar like bulls.\n\n\"What, in your lap?\" said Margaret, answering a gesture of the suffering\ngirl. \"Nay, he is too heavy, and thou in such pain.\"\n\n\"I love him too dear to feel his weight,\" was the reply.\n\nMargaret took this opportunity, and made her toilet. \"I am for the\nkerk,\" said she, \"to hear a beautiful preacher.\" Kate sighed. \"And a\nminute ago, Kate, I was all agog to go; that is the way with me this\nmonth past; up and down, up and down, like the waves of the Zuyder Zee.\nI'd as lieve stay aside thee; say the word!\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Kate, \"prithee go; and bring me back every word. Well-a-day\nthat I cannot go myself.\" And the tears stood in the patient's eyes.\nThis decided Margaret, and she kissed Kate, looked under her lashes at\nthe boy, and heaved a little sigh. \"I trow I must not,\" said she. \"I\nnever could kiss him a little; and my father was dead against waking\na child by day or night When 'tis thy pleasure to wake, speak thy aunt\nKate the two new words thou hast gotten.\" And she went out, looking\nlovingly over her shoulder, and shut the door inaudibly.\n\n\n\"Joan, you will lend me a hand, and peel these?\" said Catherine.\n\n\"That I will, dame.\" And the cooking proceeded with silent vigour.\n\n\"Now, Joan, them which help me cook and serve the meat, they help me eat\nit; that's a rule.\"\n\n\"There's worse laws in Holland than that. Your will is my pleasure,\nmistress; for my Luke hath got his supper i' the air. He is digging\nto-day by good luck.\" (Margaret came down.)\n\n\"Eh, woman, yon is an ugly trade. There she has just washed her face\nand gi'en her hair a turn, and now who is like her? Rotterdam, that for\nyou!\" and Catherine snapped her fingers at the capital. \"Give us a buss,\nhussy! Now mind, Eli won't wait supper for the duke. Wherefore, loiter\nnot after your kerk is over.\"\n\nJoan and she both followed her to the door, and stood at it watching\nher a good way down the street. For among homely housewives going out\no' doors is half an incident. Catherine commented on the launch: \"There,\nJoan, it is almost to me as if I had just started my own daughter for\nkerk, and stood a looking after: the which I've done it manys and manys\nthe times. Joan, lass, she won't hear a word against our Gerard; and\nhe be alive, he has used her cruel; that is why my bowels yearn for the\npoor wench. I'm older and wiser than she; and so I'll wed her to yon\nsimple Luke, and there an end. What's one grandchild?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXV\n\nTHE CLOISTER AND THE HEARTH\n\nThe sermon had begun when Margaret entered the great church of St.\nLaurens. It was a huge edifice, far from completed. Churches were not\nbuilt in a year. The side aisles were roofed, but not the mid aisle nor\nthe chancel; the pillars and arches were pretty perfect, and some of\nthem whitewashed. But only one window in the whole church was glazed;\nthe rest were at present great jagged openings in the outer walls.\n\nBut to-day all these uncouth imperfections made the church beautiful.\nIt was a glorious summer afternoon, and the sunshine came broken into\nmarvellous forms through those irregular openings, and played bewitching\npranks upon so many broken surfaces.\n\nIt streamed through the gaping walls, and clove the dark cool side\naisles with rivers of glory, and dazzled and glowed on the white pillars\nbeyond.\n\nAnd nearly the whole central aisle was chequered with light and shade in\nbroken outlines; the shades seeming cooler and more soothing than ever\nshade was, and the lights like patches of amber diamond animated with\nheavenly fire. And above, from west to east the blue sky vaulted the\nlofty aisle, and seemed quite close.\n\nThe sunny caps of the women made a sea of white contrasting exquisitely\nwith that vivid vault of blue.\n\nFor the mid aisle, huge as it was, was crammed, yet quite still. The\nwords and the mellow, gentle, earnest voice of the preacher held them\nmute.\n\nMargaret stood spellbound at the beauty, the devotion, \"the great calm,\"\nShe got behind a pillar in the north aisle; and there, though she could\nhardly catch a word, a sweet devotional langour crept over her at the\nloveliness of the place and the preacher's musical voice; and balmy oil\nseemed to trickle over the waves in her heart and smooth them. So she\nleaned against the pillar with eyes half closed, and all seemed soft and\ndreamy.\n\nShe felt it good to be there.\n\nPresently she saw a lady leave an excellent place opposite to get out of\nthe sun, which was indeed pouring on her head from the window. Margaret\nwent round softly but swiftly; and was fortunate enough to get the\nplace. She was now beside a pillar of the south aisle, and not above\nfifty feet from the preacher. She was at his side, a little behind him,\nbut could hear every word.\n\nHer attention, however, was soon distracted by the shadow of a man's\nhead and shoulders bobbing up and down so drolly she had some ado to\nkeep from smiling.\n\nYet it was nothing essentially droll.\n\nIt was the sexton digging.\n\nShe found that out in a moment by looking behind her, through the\nwindow, to whence the shadow came.\n\nNow as she was looking at Jorian Ketel digging, suddenly a tone of the\npreacher's voice fell upon her ear and her mind so distinctly, it seemed\nliterally to strike her, and make her vibrate inside and out.\n\nHer hand went to her bosom, so strange and sudden was the thrill. Then\nshe turned round, and looked at the preacher. His back was turned, and\nnothing visible but his tonsure. She sighed. That tonsure, being all she\nsaw, contradicted the tone effectually.\n\nYet she now leaned a little forward with downcast eyes, hoping for that\naccent again. It did not come. But the whole voice grew strangely upon\nher. It rose and fell as the preacher warmed; and it seemed to waken\nfaint echoes of a thousand happy memories. She would not look to dispel\nthe melancholy pleasure this voice gave her.\n\nPresently, in the middle of an eloquent period, the preacher stopped.\n\nShe almost sighed; a soothing music had ended. Could the sermon be ended\nalready? No; she looked round; the people did not move.\n\nA good many faces seemed now to turn her way.' She looked behind her\nsharply. There was nothing there.\n\nStartled countenances near her now eyed the preacher. She followed their\nlooks; and there, in the pulpit, was a face as of a staring corpse. The\nfriar's eyes, naturally large, and made larger by the thinness of his\ncheeks, were dilated to supernatural size, and glaring her way out of a\nbloodless face.\n\nShe cringed and turned fearfully round: for she thought there must be\nsome terrible thing near her. No; there was nothing; she was the outside\nfigure of the listening crowd.\n\nAt this moment the church fell into commotion, Figures got up all over\nthe building, and craned forward; agitated faces by hundreds gazed from\nthe friar to Margaret, and from Margaret to the friar. The turning to\nand fro of so many caps made a loud rustle. Then came shrieks of nervous\nwomen, and buzzing of men; and Margaret, seeing so many eyes levelled at\nher, shrank terrified behind the pillar, with one scared, hurried glance\nat the preacher.\n\nMomentary as that glance was, it caught in that stricken face an\nexpression that made her shiver.\n\nShe turned faint, and sat down on a heap of chips the workmen had left,\nand buried her face in her hands, The sermon went on again. She heard\nthe sound of it; but not the sense. She tried to think, but her mind was\nin a whirl, Thought would fix itself in no shape but this: that on that\nprodigy-stricken face she had seen a look stamped. And the recollection\nof that look now made her quiver from head to foot.\n\nFor that look was \"RECOGNITION.\"\n\nThe sermon, after wavering some time, ended in a strain of exalted,\nnay, feverish eloquence, that went far to make the crowd forget the\npreacher's strange pause and ghastly glare. Margaret mingled hastily\nwith the crowd, and went out of the church with them.\n\nThey went their ways home. But she turned at the door, and went into the\nchurchyard; to Peter's grave. Poor as she was, she had given him a slab\nand a headstone. She sat down on the slab, and kissed it. Then threw her\napron over her head that no one might distinguish her by her hair.\n\n\"Father,\" she said, \"thou hast often heard me say I am wading in deep\nwaters; but now I begin to think God only knows the bottom of them. I'll\nfollow that friar round the world, but I'll see him at arm's length. And\nhe shall tell me why he looked towards me like a dead man wakened; and\nnot a soul behind me. Oh, father; you often praised me here: speak a\nword for me there. For I am wading in deep waters.\"\n\nHer father's tomb commanded a side view of the church door. And on that\ntomb she sat, with her face covered, waylaying the holy preacher.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXVI\n\nTHE CLOISTER AND THE HEARTH\n\nThe cool church chequered with sunbeams and crowned with heavenly\npurple, soothed and charmed Father Clement, as it did Margaret; and\nmore, it carried his mind direct to the Creator of all good and pure\ndelights. Then his eye fell on the great aisle crammed with his country\nfolk; a thousand snowy caps, filigreed with gold. Many a hundred leagues\nhe had travelled; but seen nothing like them, except snow. In the\nmorning he had thundered; but this sweet afternoon seemed out of tune\nwith threats. His bowels yearned over that multitude; and he must tell\nthem of God's love: poor souls, they heard almost as little of it\nfrom the pulpit then a days as the heathen used. He told them the glad\ntidings of salvation. The people hung upon his gentle, earnest tongue.\n\nHe was not one of those preachers who keep gyrating in the pulpit like\nthe weathercock on the steeple. He moved the hearts of others more than\nhis own body. But on the other hand he did not entirely neglect those\nwho were in bad places. And presently, warm with this theme, that none\nof all that multitude might miss the joyful tidings of Christ's love, he\nturned him towards the south aisle.\n\nAnd there, in a stream of sunshine from the window, was the radiant face\nof Margaret Brandt. He gazed at it without emotion. It just benumbed\nhim, soul and body.\n\nBut soon the words died in his throat, and he trembled as he glared at\nit.\n\nThere, with her auburn hair bathed in sunbeams, and glittering like the\ngloriola of a saint, and her face glowing doubly, with its own beauty,\nand the sunshine it was set in-stood his dead love.\n\nShe was leaning very lightly against a white column. She was listening\nwith tender, downcast lashes.\n\nHe had seen her listen so to him a hundred times.\n\nThere was no change in her. This was the blooming Margaret he had left:\nonly a shade riper and more lovely.\n\nHe started at her with monstrous eyes and bloodless cheeks.\n\nThe people died out of his sight. He heard, as in a dream, a rustling\nand rising all over the church; but could not take his prodigy-stricken\neyes off that face, all life, and bloom, and beauty, and that wondrous\nauburn hair glistening gloriously in the sun.\n\nHe gazed, thinking she must vanish.\n\nShe remained.\n\nAll in a moment she was looking at him, full.\n\nHer own violet eyes!!\n\nAt this he was beside himself, and his lips parted to shriek out her\nname, when she turned her head swiftly, and soon after vanished, but not\nwithout one more glance, which, though rapid as lightning, encountered\nhis, and left her couching and quivering with her mind in a whirl, and\nhim panting and gripping the pulpit convulsively. For this glance of\nhers, though not recognition, was the startled inquiring, nameless,\nindescribable look that precedes recognition. He made a mighty effort,\nand muttered something nobody could understand: then feebly resumed his\ndiscourse; and stammered and babbled on a while, till by degrees forcing\nhimself, now she was out of sight, to look on it as a vision from the\nother world, he rose into a state of unnatural excitement, and concluded\nin a style of eloquence that electrified the simple; for it bordered on\nrhapsody.\n\nThe sermon ended, he sat down on the pulpit stool, terribly shaken, But\npresently an idea very characteristic of the time took possession of\nhim, He had sought her grave at Sevenbergen in vain. She had now been\npermitted to appear to him, and show him that she was buried here;\nprobably hard by that very pillar, where her spirit had showed itself to\nhim.\n\nThis idea once adopted soon settled on his mind with all the Certainty\nof a fact. And he felt he had only to speak to the sexton (whom to his\ngreat disgust he had seen working during the sermon), to learn the spot\nwhere she was laid.\n\nThe church was now quite empty. He came down from the pulpit and stepped\nthrough an aperture in the south wall on to the grass, and went up to\nthe sexton. He knew him in a moment. But Jorian never suspected the\npoor lad, whose life he had saved, in this holy friar. The loss of his\nshapely beard had wonderfully altered the outline of his face. This had\nchanged him even more than his tonsure, his short hair sprinkled with\npremature grey, and his cheeks thinned and paled by fasts and vigils.\n\n\"My son,\" said Friar Clement softly, \"if you keep any memory of those\nwhom you lay in the earth, prithee tell me is any Christian buried\ninside the church, near one of the pillars?\"\n\n\"Nay, father,\" said Jorian, \"here in the churchyard lie buried all that\nburied be. Why?\"\n\n\"No matter, Prithee tell me then where lieth Margaret Brandt.\"\n\n\"Margaret Brandt?\" And Jorian stared stupidly at the speaker.\n\n\"She died about three years ago, and was buried here.\"\n\n\"Oh, that is another matter,\" said Jorian; \"that was before my time; the\nvicar could tell you, likely; if so be she was a gentlewoman, or at the\nleast rich enough to pay him his fee.\"\n\n\"Alas, my son, she was poor (and paid a heavy penalty for it); but born\nof decent folk. Her father, Peter, was a learned physician; she came\nhither from Sevenbergen--to die.\"\n\nWhen Clement had uttered these words his head sunk upon his breast, and\nhe seemed to have no power nor wish to question Jorian more. I doubt\neven if he knew where he was. He was lost in the past.\n\nJorian put down his spade, and standing upright in the grave, set his\narms akimbo, and said sulkily, \"Are you making a fool of me, holy sir,\nor has some wag been making a fool of you!\" And having relieved his mind\nthus, he proceeded to dig again, with a certain vigour that showed his\nsomewhat irritable temper was ruffled.\n\nClement gazed at him with a puzzled but gently reproachful eye, for\nthe tone was rude, and the words unintelligible. Good-natured, though\ncrusty, Jorian had not thrown up three spadefuls ere he became ashamed\nof it himself. \"Why, what a base churl am I to speak thus to thee, holy\nfather; and thou a standing there, looking at me like a lamb. Aha! I\nhave it; 'tis Peter Brandt's grave you would fain see, not Margaret's.\nHe does lie here; hard by the west door. There; I'll show you.\" And he\nlaid down his spade, and put on his doublet and jerkin to go with the\nfriar.\n\nHe did not know there was anybody sitting on Peter's tomb. Still less\nthat she was watching for this holy friar.\n\nPietro Vanucci and Andrea did not recognize him without his beard. The\nfact is, that the beard which has never known a razor grows in a very\npicturesque and characteristic form, and becomes a feature in the face;\nso that its removal may in some cases be an effectual disguise.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXVII\n\nWhile Jorian was putting on his doublet and jerkin to go to Peter's\ntomb, his tongue was not idle. \"They used to call him a magician out\nSevenbergen way. And they do say he gave 'em a touch of his trade at\nparting; told 'em he saw Margaret's lad a-coming down Rhine in brave\nclothes and store o' money, but his face scarred by foreign glaive,\nand not altogether so many arms and legs as a went away wi'. But, dear\nheart, nought came on't. Margaret is still wearying for her lad; and\nPeter, he lies as quiet as his neighbours; not but what she hath put a\nstone slab over him, to keep him where he is: as you shall see.\"\n\nHe put both hands on the edge of the grave, and was about to raise\nhimself out of it, but the friar laid a trembling hand on his shoulder,\nand said in a strange whisper--\n\n\"How long since died Peter Brandt?\"\n\n\"About two months, Why?\"\n\n\"And his daughter buried him, say you?\"\n\n\"Nay, I buried him, but she paid the fee and reared the stone.\"\n\n\"Then--but he had just one daughter; Margaret?\"\n\n\"No more leastways, that he owned to.\"\n\n\"Then you think Margaret is--is alive?\"\n\n\"Think? Why, I should be dead else. Riddle me that.\"\n\n\"Alas, how can I? You love her!\"\n\n\"No more than reason, being a married man, and father of four more\nsturdy knaves like myself. Nay, the answer is, she saved my life scarce\nsix weeks agone. Now had she been dead she couldn't ha' kept me alive.\nBless your heart, I couldn't keep a thing on my stomach; nor doctors\ncouldn't make me. My Joan says, ''Tis time to buy thee a shroud.' 'I dare\nsay, so 'tis,' says I; but try and borrow one first.' In comes my lady,\nthis Margaret, which she died three years ago, by your way on't,\nopens the windows, makes 'em shift me where I lay, and cures me in the\ntwinkling of a bedpost; but wi' what? there pinches the shoe; with the\nscurviest herb, and out of my own garden, too; with sweet feverfew. A\nherb, quotha, 'tis a weed; leastways it was a weed till it cured me,\nbut now whene'er I pass my hunch I doff bonnet, and says I, 'fly service\nt'ye.' Why, how now, father, you look wondrous pale, and now you are\nred, and now you are white? Why, what is the matter? What, in Heaven's\nname, is the matter?\"\n\n\"The surprise--the joy--the wonder--the fear,\" gasped Clement.\n\n\"Why, what is it to thee? Art thou of kin to Margaret Brandt?\"\n\n\"Nay; but I knew one that loved her well, so well her death nigh killed\nhim, body and soul. And yet thou sayest she lives. And I believe thee.\"\n\nJorian stared, and after a considerable silence said very gravely,\n\"Father, you have asked me many questions, and I have answered them\ntruly; now for our Lady's sake answer me but two. Did you in very sooth\nknow one who loved this poor lass? Where?\"\n\nClement was on the point of revealing himself, but he remembered\nJerome's letter, and shrank from being called by the name he had borne\nin the world.\n\n\"I knew him in Italy,\" said he.\n\n\"If you knew him you can tell me his name,\" said Jorian cautiously.\n\n\"His name was Gerard Eliassoen.\"\n\n\"Oh, but this is strange. Stay, what made thee say Margaret Brandt was\ndead?\"\n\n\"I was with Gerard when a letter came from Margaret Van Eyck. The letter\ntold him she he loved was dead and buried. Let me sit down, for my\nstrength fails me, Foul play! Foul play!\"\n\n\"Father,\" said Jorian, \"I thank Heaven for sending thee to me, Ay, sit\nye down; ye do look like a ghost; ye fast overmuch to be strong. My mind\nmisgives me; methinks I hold the clue to this riddle, and if I do, there\nbe two knaves in this town whose heads I would fain batter to pieces as\nI do this mould;\" and he clenched his teeth and raised his long spade\nabove his head, and brought it furiously down upon the heap several\ntimes. \"Foul play? You never said a truer word i' your life; and if you\nknow where Gerard is now, lose no time, but show him the trap they have\nlaid for him. Mine is but a dull head, but whiles the slow hound puzzles\nout the scent--go to, And I do think you and I ha' got hold of two ends\no' one stick, and a main foul one.\"\n\nJorian then, after some of those useless preliminaries men of his class\nalways deal in, came to the point of the story. He had been employed by\nthe burgomaster of Tergou to repair the floor of an upper room in his\nhouse, and when it was almost done, Coming suddenly to fetch away his\ntools, curiosity had been excited by some loud words below, and he had\nlain down on his stomach, and heard the burgomaster talking about a\nletter which Cornelis and Sybrandt were minded to convey into the place\nof one that a certain Hans Memling was taking to Gerard; \"and it seems\ntheir will was good, but their stomach was small; so to give them\ncourage the old man showed them a drawer full of silver, and if they did\nthe trick they should each put a hand in, and have all the silver they\ncould hold in't. Well, father,\" continued Jorian, \"I thought not much\non't at the time, except for the bargain itself, that kept me awake\nmostly all night. Think on't! Next morning at peep of day who should I\nsee but my masters Cornelis and Sybrandt come out of their house each\nwith a black eye. 'Oho,' says I, 'what yon Hans hath put his mark on ye;\nwell now I hope that is all you have got for your pains.' Didn't they\nmake for the burgomaster's house? I to my hiding-place.\"\n\nAt this part of Jorian's revelation the monk's nostril dilated, and his\nrestless eye showed the suspense he was in.\n\n\"Well, father,\" continued Jorian, \"the burgomaster brought them into\nthat same room. He had a letter in his hand; but I am no scholar;\nhowever, I have got as many eyes in my head as the Pope hath, and I saw\nthe drawer opened, and those two knaves put in each a hand and draw it\nout full. And, saints in glory, how they tried to hold more, and more,\nand more o' yon stuff! And Sybrandt, he had daubed his hand in something\nsticky, I think 'twas glue, and he made shift to carry one or two pieces\naway a sticking to the back of his hand, he! he! he! 'Tis a sin to\nlaugh. So you see luck was on the wrong side as usual; they had done\nthe trick; but how they did it, that, methinks, will never be known till\ndoomsday. Go to, they left their immortal jewels in yon drawer. Well,\nthey got a handful of silver for them; the devil had the worst o' yon\nbargain. There, father, that is off my mind; often I longed to tell it\nsome one, but I durst not to the women; or Margaret would not have had\na friend left in the world; for those two black-hearted villains are the\nfavourites, 'Tis always so. Have not the old folk just taken a brave new\nshop for them in this very town, in the Hoog Straet? There may you see\ntheir sign, a gilt sheep and a lambkin; a brace of wolves sucking their\ndam would be nigher the mark. And there the whole family feast this day;\noh, 'tis a fine world. What, not a word, holy father; you sit there like\nstone, and have not even a curse to bestow on them, the stony-hearted\nmiscreants. What, was it not enough the poor lad was all alone in a\nstrange land; must his own flesh and blood go and lie away the one\nblessing his enemies had left him? And then think of her pining and\npining all these years, and sitting at the window looking adown the\nstreet for Gerard! and so constant, so tender, and true: my wife says\nshe is sure no woman ever loved a man truer than she loves the lad those\nvillains have parted from her; and the day never passes but she weeps\nsalt tears for him. And when I think, that, but for those two greedy\nlying knaves, yon winsome lad, whose life I saved, might be by her side\nthis day the happiest he in Holland; and the sweet lass, that saved my\nlife, might be sitting with her cheek upon her sweetheart's shoulder,\nthe happiest she in Holland in place of the saddest; oh, I thirst for\ntheir blood, the nasty, sneaking, lying, cogging, cowardly, heartless,\nbowelless--how now?\"\n\nThe monk started wildly up, livid with fury and despair, and rushed\nheadlong from the place with both hands clenched and raised on high.\nSo terrible was this inarticulate burst of fury, that Jorian's puny ire\ndied out at sight of it, and he stood looking dismayed after the human\ntempest he had launched.\n\nWhile thus absorbed he felt his arm grasped by a small, tremulous hand.\n\nIt was Margaret Brandt.\n\nHe started; her coming there just then seemed so strange. She had waited\nlong on Peter's tombstone, but the friar did not come, So she went into\nthe church to see if he was there still. She could not find him.\n\nPresently, going up the south aisle, the gigantic shadow of a friar came\nrapidly along the floor and part of a pillar, and seemed to pass through\nher. She was near screaming; but in a moment remembered Jorian's shadow\nhad come in so from the churchyard; and tried to clamber out the nearest\nway. She did so, but with some difficulty; and by that time Clement was\njust disappearing down the street; yet, so expressive at times is the\nbody as well as the face, she could see he was greatly agitated. Jorian\nand she looked at one another, and at the wild figure of the distant\nfriar.\n\n\"Well?\" said she to Jorian, trembling.\n\n\"Well,\" said he, \"you startled me. How come you here of all people?\"\n\n\"Is this a time for idle chat? What said he to you? He has been speaking\nto you; deny it not.\"\n\n\"Girl, as I stand here, he asked me whereabout you were buried in this\nchurchyard.\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"I told him, nowhere, thank Heaven: you were alive and saving other folk\nfrom the churchyard.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well, the long and the short is, he knew thy Gerard in Italy; and a\nletter came saying you were dead; and it broke thy poor lad's heart. Let\nme see; who was the letter written by? Oh, by the demoiselle van\nEyck. That was his way of it. But I up and told him nay; 'twas neither\ndemoiselle nor dame that penned yon lie, but Ghysbrecht Van Swieten, and\nthose foul knaves, Cornelis and Sybrandt; these changed the true letter\nfor one of their own; I told him as how I saw the whole villainy done\nthrough a chink; and now, if I have not been and told you!\"\n\n\"Oh, cruel! cruel! But he lives. The fear of fears is gone. Thank God!\"\n\n\"Ay, lass; and as for thine enemies, I have given them a dig. For yon\nfriar is friendly to Gerard, and he is gone to Eli's house, methinks.\nFor I told him where to find Gerard's enemies and thine, and wow but he\nwill give them their lesson. If ever a man was mad with rage, its yon.\nHe turned black and white, and parted like a stone from a sling. Girl,\nthere was thunder in his eye and silence on his lips. Made me cold a\ndid.\"\n\n\"Oh, Jorian, what have you done?\" cried Margaret. \"Quick! quick! help me\nthither, for the power is gone all out of my body. You know him not as\nI do. Oh, if you had seen the blow he gave Ghysbrecht; and heard the\nfrightful crash! Come, save him from worse mischief. The water is deep\nenow; but not bloody yet, come!\"\n\nHer accents were so full of agony that Jorian sprang out of the grave\nand came with her, huddling on his jerkin as he went.\n\nBut as they hurried along, he asked her what on earth she meant? \"I talk\nof this friar, and you answer me of Gerard.\"\n\n\"Man, see you not, this is Gerard!\"\n\n\"This, Gerard? what mean ye?\"\n\n\"I mean, yon friar is my boy's father. I have waited for him long,\nJorian. Well, he is come to me at last. And thank God for it. Oh, my\npoor child! Quicker, Jorian, quicker!\"\n\n\"Why, thou art mad as he. Stay! By St. Bavon, yon was Gerard's face;\n'twas nought like it; yet somehow--'twas it. Come on! come on! let me\nsee the end of this.\"\n\n\"The end? How many of us will live to see that?\"\n\nThey hurried along in breathless silence, till they reached Hoog Straet.\n\nThen Jorian tried to reassure her. \"You are making your own trouble,\"\nsaid he; \"who says he has gone thither? more likely to the convent to\nweep and pray, poor soul. Oh, cursed, cursed villains!\"\n\n\"Did not you tell him where those villains bide?\"\n\n\"Ay, that I did.\"\n\n\"Then quicker, oh, Jorian, quicker. I see the house. Thank God and all\nthe saints, I shall be in time to calm him. I know what I'll say to him;\nHeaven forgive me! Poor Catherine; 'tis of her I think: she has been a\nmother to me.\"\n\nThe shop was a corner house, with two doors; one in the main street, for\ncustomers, and a house-door round the corner.\n\nMargaret and Jorian were now within twenty yards of the shop, when they\nheard a roar inside, like as of some wild animal, and the friar burst\nout, white and raging, and went tearing down the street.\n\nMargaret screamed, and sank fainting on Jorian's arm.\n\nJorian shouted after him, \"Stay, madman, know thy friends.\" But he was\ndeaf, and went headlong, shaking his clenched fists high, high in the\nair.\n\n\"Help me in, good Jorian,\" moaned Margaret, turning suddenly calm. \"Let\nme know the worst; and die.\"\n\nHe supported her trembling limbs into the house.\n\nIt seemed unnaturally still; not a sound.\n\nJorian's own heart beat fast.\n\nA door was before him, unlatched. He pushed it softly with his left\nhand, and Margaret and he stood on the threshold.\n\nWhat they saw there you shall soon know.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXVIII\n\nIt was supper-time. Eli's family were collected round the board;\nMargaret only was missing. To Catherine's surprise, Eli said he would\nwait a bit for her.\n\n\"Why, I told her you would not wait for the duke.\"\n\n\"She is not the duke; she is a poor, good lass, that hath waited not\nminutes, but years, for a graceless son of mine. You can put the meat\non the board all the same; then we can fall to, without farther loss o'\ntime, when she does come.\"\n\nThe smoking dishes smelt so savoury that Eli gave way. \"She will come if\nwe begin,\" said he; \"they always do, Come, sit ye down, Mistress Joan;\ny'are not here for a slave, I trow, but a guest. There, I hear a quick\nstep off covers, and fall to.\"\n\nThe covers were withdrawn, and the knives brandished.\n\nThen burst into the room, not the expected Margaret, but a Dominican\nfriar, livid with rage.\n\nHe was at the table in a moment, in front of Cornelis and Sybrandt,\nthrew his tall body over the narrow table, and with two hands hovering\nabove their shrinking heads, like eagles over a quarry, he cursed\nthem by name, soul and body, in this world and the next. It was an age\neloquent in curses; and this curse was so full, so minute, so blighting,\nblasting, withering, and tremendous, that I am afraid to put all the\nwords on paper. \"Cursed be the lips,\" he shrieked, \"which spoke the\nlie that Margaret was dead; may they rot before the grave, and kiss\nwhite-hot iron in hell thereafter; doubly cursed be the hands that\nchanged those letters, and be they struck off by the hangman's knife,\nand handle hell fire for ever; thrice accursed be the cruel hearts\nthat did conceive that damned lie, to part true love for ever; may they\nsicken and wither on earth joyless, loveless, hopeless; and wither to\ndust before their time; and burn in eternal fire,\" He cursed the meat\nat their mouths and every atom of their bodies, from their hair to the\nsoles of their feet. Then turning from the cowering, shuddering pair,\nwho had almost hid themselves beneath the table, he tore a letter out of\nhis bosom, and flung it down before his father.\n\n\"Read that, thou hard old man, that didst imprison thy son, read, and\nsee what monsters thou hast brought into the world, The memory of my\nwrongs and hers dwell with you all for ever! I will meet you again at\nthe judgment day; on earth ye will never see me more.\"\n\nAnd in a moment, as he had come, so he was gone, leaving them stiff, and\ncold, and white as statues round the smoking board.\n\nAnd this was the sight that greeted Margaret's eyes and Jorian's--pale\nfigures of men and women petrified around the untasted food, as Eastern\npoets feigned.\n\nMargaret glanced her eye round, and gasped out, \"Oh, joy! all here; no\nblood hath been shed. Oh, you cruel, cruel men! I thank God he hath not\nslain you.\"\n\nAt sight of her Catherine gave an eloquent scream; then turned her head\naway. But Eli, who had just cast his eye over the false letter, and\nbegun to understand it all, seeing the other victim come in at that very\nmoment with her wrongs reflected in her sweet, pale face, started to his\nfeet in a transport of rage, and shouted, \"Stand clear, and let me get\nat the traitors, I'll hang for them,\" And in a moment he whipped out his\nshort sword, and fell upon them.\n\n\"Fly!\" screamed Margaret. \"Fly!\"\n\nThey slipped howling under the table, and crawled out the other side.\n\nBut ere they could get to the door, the furious old man ran round and\nintercepted them. Catherine only screamed and wrung her hands; your\nnotables are generally useless at such a time; and blood would certainly\nhave flowed, but Margaret and Jorian seized the fiery old man's arms,\nand held them with all their might, whilst the pair got clear of the\nhouse; then they let him go; and he went vainly raging after them out\ninto the street.\n\nThey were a furlong off, running like hares.\n\nHe hacked down the board on which their names were written, and brought\nit indoors, and flung it into the chimney-place. Catherine was sitting\nrocking herself with her apron over her head. Joan had run to her\nhusband. Margaret had her arms round Catherine's neck; and pale and\npanting, was yet making efforts to comfort her.\n\nBut it was not to be done, \"Oh, my poor children!\" she cried. \"Oh,\nmiserable mother! 'Tis a mercy Kate was ill upstairs. There, I have\nlived to thank God for that!\" she cried, with a fresh burst of sobs. \"It\nwould have killed her. He had better have stayed in Italy, as come home\nto curse his own flesh and blood and set us all by the ears.\n\n\"Oh, hold your chat, woman,\" cried Eli angrily; \"you are still on the\nside of the ill-doer, You are cheap served; your weakness made the\nrogues what they are; I was for correcting them in their youth: for\nsore ills, sharp remedies; but you still sided with their faults, and\nundermined me, and baffled wise severity. And you, Margaret, leave\ncomforting her that ought rather to comfort you; for what is her hurt\nto yours? But she never had a grain of justice under her skin; and never\nwill. So come thou to me, that am thy father from this hour.\"\n\nThis was a command; so she kissed Catherine, and went tottering to him,\nand he put her on a chair beside him, and she laid her feeble head on\nhis honest breast; but not a tear: it was too deep for that.\n\n\"Poor lamb,\" said he. After a while--\"Come, good folks,\" said true Eli,\nin a broken voice, to Jorian and Joan, \"we are in a little trouble, as\nyou see; but that is no reason you should starve. For our Lady's sake,\nfall to; and add not to my grief the reputation of a churl. What the\ndickens!\" added he, with a sudden ghastly attempt at stout-heartedness,\n\"the more knaves I have the luck to get shut of, the more my need of\ntrue men and women, to help me clear the dish, and cheer mine eye with\nhonest faces about me where else were gaps. Fall to, I do entreat ye.\"\n\nCatherine, sobbing, backed his request. Poor, simple, antique,\nhospitable souls! Jorian, whose appetite, especially since his illness,\nwas very keen, was for acting on this hospitable invitation; but Joan\nwhispered a word in his ear, and he instantly drew back, \"Nay, I'll\ntouch no meat that Holy Church hath cursed.\"\n\n\"In sooth, I forgot,\" said Eli apologetically. \"My son, who was reared\nat my table, hath cursed my victuals. That seems strange. Well, what God\nwills, man must bow to.\"\n\nThe supper was flung out into the yard.\n\nJorian took his wife home, and heavy sadness reigned in Eli's house that\nnight.\n\nMeantime, where was Clement?\n\nLying at full length upon the floor of the convent church, with his lips\nupon the lowest step of the altar, in an indescribable state of terror,\nmisery, penitence, and self-abasement: through all which struggled\ngleams of joy that Margaret was alive.\n\nNight fell and found him lying there weeping and praying; and morning\nwould have found him there too; but he suddenly remembered that,\nabsorbed in his own wrongs and Margaret's, he had committed another sin\nbesides intemperate rage. He had neglected a dying man.\n\nHe rose instantly, groaning at his accumulated wickedness, and set out\nto repair the omission. The weather had changed; it was raining hard,\nand when he got clear of the town, he heard the wolves baying; they were\non the foot, But Clement was himself again, or nearly; he thought little\nof danger or discomfort, having a shameful omission of religious duty to\nrepair: he went stoutly forward through rain and darkness.\n\nAnd as he went, he often beat his breast, and cried, \"MEA CULPA! MEA\nCULPA!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LXXXIX\n\nWhat that sensitive mind, and tender conscience, and loving heart, and\nreligious soul, went through even in a few hours, under a situation so\nsudden and tremendous, is perhaps beyond the power of words to paint.\n\nFancy yourself the man; and then put yourself in his place! Were I to\nwrite a volume on it, we should have to come to that at last.\n\nI shall relate his next two overt acts. They indicate his state of mind\nafter the first fierce tempest of the soul had subsided. After\nspending the night with the dying hermit in giving and receiving holy\nconsolations, he set out not for Rotterdam, but for Tergou. He went\nthere to confront his fatal enemy the burgomaster, and by means of that\nparchment, whose history, by-the-by was itself a romance, to make him\ndisgorge; and give Margaret her own.\n\nHeated and dusty, he stopped at the fountain, and there began to eat his\nblack bread and drink of the water. But in the middle of his frugal meal\na female servant came running, and begged him to come and shrive her\ndying master, He returned the bread to his wallet, and followed her\nwithout a word.\n\nShe took him--to the Stadthouse.\n\nHe drew back with a little shudder when he saw her go in.\n\nBut he almost instantly recovered himself, and followed her into the\nhouse, and up the stairs. And there in bed, propped up by pillows, lay\nhis deadly enemy, looking already like a corpse.\n\nClement eyed him a moment from the door, and thought of all the tower,\nthe wood, the letter. Then he said in a low voice, \"Pax vobiscum!\" He\ntrembled a little while he said it.\n\nThe sick man welcomed him as eagerly as his weak state permitted. \"Thank\nHeaven, thou art come in time to absolve me from my sins, father, and\npray for my soul, thou and thy brethren.\"\n\n\"My son,\" said Clement, \"before absolution cometh confession. In which\nact there must be no reservation, as thou valuest thy soul's weal.\nBethink thee, therefore, wherein thou hast most offended God and the\nChurch, while I offer up a prayer for wisdom to direct thee.\"\n\nClement then kneeled and prayed; and when he rose from his knees, he\nsaid to Ghysbrecht, with apparent calmness, \"My son, confess thy sins.\"\n\n\"Ah, father,\" said the sick man, \"they are many and great.\"\n\n\"Great, then, be thy penitence, my son; so shalt thou find God's mercy\ngreat.\"\n\nGhysbrecht put his hands together, and began to confess with every\nappearance of contrition.\n\nHe owned he had eaten meat in mid-Lent. He had often absented himself\nfrom mass on the Lord's day, and saints' days; and had trifled with\nother religious observances, which he enumerated with scrupulous\nfidelity.\n\nWhen he had done, the friar said quietly, \"'Tis well, my son, These be\nfaults. Now to thy crimes, Thou hadst done better to begin with them.\"\n\n\"Why, father, what crimes lie to my account if these be none?\"\n\n\"Am I confessing to thee, or thou to me?\" said Clement somewhat\nseverely.\n\n\"Forgive me, father! Why, surely, I to you. But I know not what you call\ncrimes.\"\n\n\"The seven deadly sins, art thou clear of them?\"\n\n\"Heaven forefend I should be guilty of them. I know them not by name.\"\n\n\"Many do them all that cannot name them. Begin with that one which leads\nto lying, theft, and murder.\"\n\n\"I am quit of that one, any way. How call you it?\"\n\n\"AVARICE, my son.\"\n\n\"Avarice? Oh, as to that, I have been a saving man all my day; but I\nhave kept a good table, and not altogether forgotten the poor. But,\nalas, I am a great sinner, Mayhap the next will catch me, What is the\nnext?\"\n\n\"We have not yet done with this one. Bethink thee, the Church is not to\nbe trifled with.\"\n\n\"Alas! am I in a condition to trifle with her now? Avarice? Avarice?\"\n\nHe looked puzzled and innocent.\n\n\"Hast thou ever robbed the fatherless?\" inquired the friar.\n\n\"Me? robbed the fatherless?\" gasped Ghysbrecht; \"not that I mind.\"\n\n\"Once more, my son, I am forced to tell thee thou art trifling with the\nChurch. Miserable man! another evasion, and I leave thee, and fiends\nwill straightway gather round thy bed, and tear thee down to the\nbottomless pit.\"\n\n\"Oh, leave me not! leave me not!\" shrieked the terrified old man. \"The\nChurch knows all. I must have robbed the fatherless. I will confess. Who\nshall I begin with? My memory for names is shaken.\"\n\nThe defence was skilful, but in this case failed.\n\n\"Hast thou forgotten Floris Brandt?\" said Clement stonily.\n\nThe sick man reared himself in bed in a pitiable state of terror. \"How\nknew you that?\" said he.\n\n\"The Church knows many things,\" said Clement coldly, \"and by many ways\nthat are dark to thee, Miserable impenitent, you called her to your\nside, hoping to deceive her, You said, 'I will not confess to the cure\nbut to some friar who knows not my misdeeds. So will I cheat the Church\non my deathbed, and die as I have lived,' But God, kinder to thee than\nthou art to thyself, sent to thee one whom thou couldst not deceive. He\nhas tried thee; He was patient with thee, and warned thee not to trifle\nwith Holy Church; but all is in vain; thou canst not confess; for thou\nart impenitent as a stone. Die, then, as thou hast lived. Methinks I see\nthe fiends crowding round the bed for their prey. They wait but for me\nto go. And I go.\"\n\nHe turned his back; but Ghysbrecht, in extremity of terror, caught him\nby the frock. \"Oh, holy man, mercy! stay. I will confess all, all. I\nrobbed my friend Floris, Alas! would it had ended there; for he lost\nlittle by me; but I kept the land from Peter his son, and from Margaret,\nPeter's daughter. Yet I was always going to give it back; but I\ncouldn't, I couldn't.\"\n\n\"Avarice, my son, avarice, Happy for thee 'tis not too late.\"\n\n\"No; I will leave it her by will. She will not have long to wait for it\nnow; not above a month or two at farthest.\"\n\n\"For which month's possession thou wouldst damn thy soul for ever, Thou\nfool!\"\n\nThe sick man groaned, and prayed the friar to be reasonable.\n\nThe friar firmly, but gently and persuasively, persisted, and with\ninfinite patience detached the dying man's gripe from another's\nproperty. There were times when his patience was tried, and he was on\nthe point of thrusting his hand into his bosom and producing the deed,\nwhich he had brought for that purpose; but after yesterday's outbreak\nhe was on his guard against choler; and to conclude, he conquered his\nimpatience; he conquered a personal repugnance to the man, so strong\nas to make his own flesh creep all the time he was struggling with this\nmiser for his soul; and at last, without a word about the deed, he won\nupon him to make full and prompt restitution.\n\nHow the restitution was made will be briefly related elsewhere: also\ncertain curious effects produced upon Ghysbrecht by it; and when and on\nwhat terms Ghysbrecht and Clement parted.\n\nI promised to relate two acts of the latter, indicative of his mind.\n\nThis is one. The other is told in two words.\n\nAs soon as he was quite sure Margaret had her own, and was a rich\nwoman--\n\nHe disappeared.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XC\n\nIt was the day after that terrible scene: the little house in the\nHoog Straet was like a grave, and none more listless and dejected than\nCatherine, so busy and sprightly by nature, After dinner, her eyes red\nwith weeping, she went to the convent to try and soften Gerard, and lay\nthe first stone at least of a reconciliation.\n\nIt was some time before she could make the porter understand whom she\nwas seeking. Eventually she learned he had left late last night, and was\nnot expected back, She went sighing with the news to Margaret. She found\nher sitting idle, like one with whom life had lost its savour; she had\nher boy clasped so tight in her arms, as if he was all she had left, and\nshe feared some one would take him too. Catherine begged her to come to\nthe Hoog Straet.\n\n\"What for?\" sighed Margaret. \"You cannot but say to yourselves, she is\nthe cause of all.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" said Catherine, \"we are not so ill-hearted, and Eli is so\nfond on you; you will maybe soften him.\"\n\n\"Oh, if you think I can do any good, I'll come,\" said Margaret, with a\nweary sigh.\n\nThey found Eli and a carpenter putting up another name in place of\nCornelis and Sybrandt's; and what should that name be but Margaret\nBrandt's.\n\nWith all her affection for Margaret, this went through poor Catherine\nlike a knife. \"The bane of one is another's meat,\" said she.\n\n\"Can he make me spend the money unjustly?\" replied Margaret coldly.\n\n\"You are a good soul,\" said Catherine. \"Ay, so best, sith he is the\nstrongest.\"\n\nThe next day Giles dropped in, and Catherine told the story all in\nfavour of the black sheep, and invited his pity for them, anathematized\nby their brother, and turned on the wide world by their father. But\nGiles's prejudices ran the other way; he heard her out, and told her\nbluntly the knaves had got off cheap; they deserved to be hanged at\nMargaret's door into the bargain, and dismissing them with contempt,\ncrowed with delight at the return of his favourite. \"I'll show him,\"\nsaid he, \"what 'tis to have a brother at court with a heart to serve a\nfriend, and a head to point the way.\"\n\n\"Bless thee, Giles,\" murmured Margaret softly.\n\n\"Thou wast ever his stanch friend, dear Giles,\" said little Kate; \"but\nalack, I know not what thou canst do for him now.\"\n\nGiles had left them, and all was sad and silent again, when a\nwell-dressed man opened the door softly, and asked was Margaret Brandt\nhere.\n\n\"D'ye hear, lass? You are wanted,\" said Catherine briskly. In her the\nGossip was indestructible.\n\n\"Well, mother,\" said Margaret listlessly, \"and here I am.\"\n\nA shuffling of feet was heard at the door, and a colourless, feeble old\nman was assisted into the room. It was Ghysbrecht Van Swieten. At\nsight of him Catherine shrieked, and threw her apron over her head, and\nMargaret shuddered violently, and turned her head swiftly away, not to\nsee him.\n\nA feeble voice issued from the strange visitor's lips, \"Good people, a\ndying man hath come to ask your forgiveness.\"\n\n\"Come to look on your work, you mean,\" said Catherine, taking down her\napron and bursting out sobbing. \"There, there, she is fainting; look to\nher, Eli, quick.\"\n\n\"Nay,\" said Margaret, in a feeble voice, \"the sight of him gave me a\nturn, that is all, Prithee, let him say his say, and go; for he is the\nmurderer of me and mine.\"\n\n\"Alas,\" said Ghysbrecht, \"I am too feeble to say it standing and no one\nbiddeth me sit down.\"\n\nEli, who had followed him into the house, interfered here, and said,\nhalf sullenly, half apologetically, \"Well, burgomaster, 'tis not our\nwont to leave a visitor standing whiles we sit. But man, man, you have\nwrought us too much ill.\" And the honest fellow's voice began to shake\nwith anger he fought hard to contain, because it was his own house.\n\nThen Ghysbrecht found an advocate in one who seldom spoke in vain in\nthat family.\n\nIt was little Kate. \"Father, mother,\" said she, \"my duty to you, but\nthis is not well. Death squares all accounts, And see you not death in\nhis face? I shall not live long, good friends; and his time is shorter\nthan mine.\"\n\nEli made haste and set a chair for their dying enemy with his own hands.\nGhysbrecht's attendants put him into it. \"Go fetch the boxes,\" said he.\nThey brought in two boxes, and then retired, leaving their master alone\nin the family he had so cruelly injured.\n\nEvery eye was now bent on him, except Margaret's. He undid the boxes\nwith unsteady fingers, and brought out of one the title-deeds of a\nproperty at Tergou. \"This land and these houses belonged to Floris\nBrandt, and do belong to thee of right, his granddaughter. These I did\nusurp for a debt long since defrayed with interest. These I now restore\ntheir rightful owner with penitent tears. In this other box are three\nhundred and forty golden angels, being the rent and fines I have\nreceived from that land more than Floris Brandt's debt to me, I have\nkept it compt, still meaning to be just one day; but Avarice withheld\nme, pray, good people, against temptation! I was not born dishonest: yet\nyou see.\"\n\n\"Well, to be sure!\" cried Catherine. \"And you the burgomaster! Hast\nwhipt good store of thieves in thy day. However,\" said she, on second\nthoughts, \"'tis better late than never, What, Margaret, art deaf? The\ngood man hath brought thee back thine own. Art a rich woman. Alack, what\na mountain o' gold!\"\n\n\"Bid him keep land and gold, and give me back my Gerard, that he stole\nfrom me with his treason,\" said Margaret, with her head still averted.\n\n\"Alas!\" said Ghysbrecht, \"would I could, what I can I have done. Is it\nnought? It cost me a sore struggle; and I rose from my last bed to do it\nmyself, lest some mischance should come between her and her rights.\"\n\n\"Old man,\" said Margaret, \"since thou, whose idol is pelf, hast done\nthis, God and the saints will, as I hope, forgive thee. As for me, I am\nneither saint nor angel, but only a poor woman, whose heart thou hast\nbroken, Speak to him, Kate, for I am like the dead.\"\n\nKate meditated a little while; and then her soft silvery voice fell\nlike a soothing melody upon the air, \"My poor sister hath a sorrow that\nriches cannot heal, Give her time, Ghysbrecht; 'tis not in nature she\nshould forgive thee all. Her boy is fatherless; and she is neither maid,\nwife, nor widow; and the blow fell but two days syne, that laid her\nheart a bleeding.\"\n\nA single heavy sob from Margaret was the comment to these words.\n\n\"Therefore, give her time! And ere thou diest, she will forgive thee\nall, ay, even to pleasure me, that haply shall not be long behind thee,\nGhysbrecht. Meantime, we, whose wounds be sore, but not so deep as hers,\ndo pardon thee, a penitent and a dying man; and I, for one, will pray\nfor thee from this hour; go in peace!\"\n\nTheir little oracle had spoken; it was enough. Eli even invited him\nto break a manchet and drink a stoup of wine to give him heart for his\njourney.\n\nBut Ghysbrecht declined, and said what he had done was a cordial to him,\n\"Man seeth but a little way before him, neighbour. This land I clung\nso to it was a bed of nettles to me all the time. 'Tis gone; and I feel\nhappier and livelier like for the loss on't.\"\n\nHe called his men, and they lifted him into the litter.\n\nWhen he was gone Catherine gloated over the money. She had never seen\nso much together, and was almost angry with Margaret, for \"sitting out\nthere like an image.\" And she dilated on the advantages of money.\n\nAnd she teased Margaret till at last she prevailed on her to come and\nlook at it.\n\n\"Better let her be, mother,\" said Kate, \"How can she relish gold, with a\nheart in her bosom liker lead?\" But Catherine persisted.\n\nThe result was, Margaret looked down at all her wealth with wondering\neyes. Then suddenly wrung her hands and cried with piercing anguish,\n\"TOO LATE! TOO LATE!\" And shook off her leaden despondency, only to go\ninto strong hysterics over the wealth that came too late to be shared\nwith him she loved.\n\nA little of this gold, a portion of this land, a year or two ago, when\nit was as much her own as now; and Gerard would have never left her side\nfor Italy or any other place.\n\n\"Too late! Too late!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCI\n\nNot many days after this came the news that Margaret Van Eyck was dead\nand buried. By a will she had made a year before, she left all her\nproperty, after her funeral expenses and certain presents to Reicht\nHeynes, to her dear daughter Margaret Brandt, requesting her to keep\nReicht as long as unmarried.\n\nBy this will Margaret inherited a furnished house, and pictures and\nsketches that in the present day would be a fortune: among the pictures\nwas one she valued more than a gallery of others.\n\nIt represented \"A Betrothal.\" The solemnity of the ceremony was marked\nin the grave face of the man, and the demure complacency of the woman.\nShe was painted almost entirely by Margaret Van Eyck, but the rest\nof the picture by Jan. The accessories were exquisitely finished, and\nremain a marvel of skill to this day. Margaret Brandt sent word to\nReicht to stay in the house till such time as she could find the heart\nto put foot in it, and miss the face and voice that used to meet her\nthere; and to take special care of the picture \"in the little cubboord:\"\nmeaning the diptych.\n\nThe next thing was, Luke Peterson came home, and heard that Gerard was a\nmonk.\n\nHe was like to go mad with joy. He came to Margaret, and said--\"heed,\nmistress. If he cannot marry you I can.\"\n\n\"You?\" said Margaret. \"Why, I have seen him.\"\n\n\"But he is a friar.\"\n\n\"He was my husband, and my boy's father long ere he was a friar. And I\nhave seen him, I've seen him.\"\n\nLuke was thoroughly puzzled. \"I'll tell you what,\" said he; \"I have\ngot a cousin a lawyer. I'll go and ask him whether you are married or\nsingle.\"\n\n\"Nay, I shall ask my own heart, not a lawyer. So that is your regard for\nme; to go making me the town talk, oh, fie!\"\n\n\"That is done already without a word from me.\"\n\n\"But not by such as seek my respect. And if you do it, never come nigh\nme again.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said Luke, with a sigh, \"you are like a dove to all the rest; but\nyou are a hardhearted tyrant to me.\"\n\n\"'Tis your own fault, dear Luke, for wooing me. That is what lets me\nfrom being as kind to you as I desire, Luke, my bonny lad, listen to\nme. I am rich now; I can make my friends happy, though not myself. Look\nround the street, look round the parish. There is many a quean in it\nfairer than I twice told, and not spoiled with weeping. Look high; and\ntake your choice. Speak you to the lass herself, and I'll speak to the\nmother; they shall not say thee nay; take my word for't.\"\n\n\"I see what ye mean,\" said Luke, turning very red. \"But if I can't have\nyour liking, I will none o' your money. I was your servant when you were\npoor as I; and poorer. No; if you would liever be a friar's leman than\nan honest man's wife, you are not the woman I took you for: so part we\nwithouten malice: seek you your comfort on yon road, where never a she\ndid find it yet, and for me, I'll live and die a bachelor. Good even,\nmistress.\"\n\n\"Farewell, dear Luke; and God forgive you for saying that to me.\"\n\nFor some days Margaret dreaded, almost as much as she desired, the\ncoming interview with Gerard. She said to herself, \"I wonder not he\nkeeps away a while; for so should I.\" However, he would hear he was\na father; and the desire to see their boy would overcome everything.\n\"And,\" said the poor girl to herself, \"if so be that meeting does not\nkill me, I feel I shall be better after it than I am now.\"\n\nBut when day after day went by, and he was not heard of, a freezing\nsuspicion began to crawl and creep towards her mind. What if his absence\nwas intentional? What if he had gone to some cold-blooded monks his\nfellows, and they had told him never to see her more? The convent had\nere this shown itself as merciless to true lovers as the grave itself.\n\nAt this thought the very life seemed to die out of her.\n\nAnd now for the first time deep indignation mingled at times with her\ngrief and apprehension. \"Can he have ever loved me? To run from me and\nhis boy without a word! Why, this poor Luke thinks more of me than he\ndoes.\"\n\nWhile her mind was in this state, Giles came roaring. \"I've hit the\nclout; our Gerard is Vicar of Gouda.\"\n\n\nA very brief sketch of the dwarf's court life will suffice to prepare\nthe reader for his own account of this feat. Some months before he went\nto court his intelligence had budded. He himself dated the change from\na certain 8th of June, when, swinging by one hand along with the week's\nwashing on a tight rope in the drying ground, something went crack\ninside his head; and lo! intellectual powers unchained. At court his\nshrewdness and bluntness of speech, coupled with his gigantic voice and\nhis small stature, made him a Power: without the last item I fear they\nwould have conducted him to that unpopular gymnasium, the gallows. The\nyoung Duchess of Burgundy, and Marie the heiress apparent, both petted\nhim, as great ladies have petted dwarfs in all ages; and the court poet\nmelted butter by the six-foot rule, and poured enough of it down his\nback to stew Goliah in. He even amplified, versified, and enfeebled\ncertain rough and ready sentences dictated by Giles.\n\nThe centipedal prolixity that resulted went to Eli by letter, thus\nentitled--\n\n     \"The high and puissant Princess Marie\n     of Bourgogne her lytel jantilman hys\n     complaynt of y' Coort, and\n     praise of a rusticall lyfe, versificated, and empapyred\n     by me the lytel jantilman's right lovynge\n     and obsequious servitor, etc.\"\n\nBut the dwarf reached his climax by a happy mixture of mind and muscle;\nthus:\n\nThe day before a grand court joust he challenged the Duke's giant to\na trial of strength. This challenge made the gravest grin, and aroused\nexpectation.\n\nGiles had a lofty pole planted ready, and at the appointed hour went up\nit like a squirrel, and by strength of arm made a right angle with his\nbody, and so remained: then slid down so quickly, that the high and\npuissant princess squeaked, and hid her face in her hands, not to see\nthe demise of her pocket-Hercules.\n\nThe giant effected only about ten feet, then looked ruefully up and\nruefully down, and descended, bathed in perspiration to argue the\nmatter.\n\n\"It was not the dwarf's greater strength, but his smaller body.\"\n\nThe spectators received this excuse with loud derision. There was the\nfact, the dwarf was great at mounting a pole: the giant only great at\nexcuses. In short Giles had gauged their intellects: with his own body\nno doubt.\n\n\"Come,\" said he, \"an ye go to that, I'll wrestle ye, my lad, if so be\nyou will let me blindfold your eyne.\"\n\nThe giant, smarting under defeat, and thinking he could surely recover\nit by this means, readily consented.\n\n\"Madam,\" said Giles, \"see you yon blind Samson? At a signal from me he\nshall make me a low obeisance, and unbonnet to me.\"\n\n\"How may that be, being blinded?\" inquired a maid of honour.\n\n\"I'll wager on Giles for one,\" said the princess.\n\n\"That is my affair.\"\n\nWhen several wagers were laid pro and con, Giles hit the giant in the\nbread-basket. He went double (the obeisance), and his bonnet fell off.\n\nThe company yelled with delight at this delicate stroke of wit, and\nGiles took to his heels. The giant followed as soon as he could recover\nhis breath and tear off his bandage. But it was too late; Giles had\nprepared a little door in the wall, through which he could pass, but not\na giant, and had coloured it so artfully, it looked like a wall; this\ndoor he tore open, and went headlong through, leaving no vestige but\nthis posy, written very large upon the reverse of his trick door--\n\n     Long limbs, big body, panting wit\n     By wee and wise is bet and bit\n\nAfter this Giles became a Force.\n\nHe shall now speak for himself.\n\nFinding Margaret unable to believe the good news, and sceptical as to\nthe affairs of Holy Church being administered by dwarfs, he narrated as\nfollows:\n\n\"When the princess sent for me to her bedroom as of custom, to keep her\nout of languor, I came not mirthful nor full of country dicts, as is my\nwont, but dull as lead.\n\n\"'Why, what aileth thee?' quo' she. 'Art sick?' 'At heart,' quo' I.\n'Alas, he is in love,' quo' she. Whereat five brazen hussies, which they\ncall them maids of honour, did giggle loud. 'Not so mad as that,' said\nI, 'seeing what I see at court of women folk.'\n\n\"'There, ladies,' quo' the princess, 'best let him a be. 'Tis a liberal\nmannikin, and still giveth more than he taketh of saucy words.'\n\n\"'In all sadness,' quo' she, 'what is the matter?'\n\n\"I told her I was meditating, and what perplexed me was, that other folk\ncould now and then keep their word, but princes never.\n\n\"'Heyday,' says she, 'thy shafts fly high this morn.' I told her, 'Ay,\nfor they hit the Truth.'\n\n\"She said I was as keen as keen; but it became not me to put riddles to\nher, nor her to answer them. 'Stand aloof a bit, mesdames,' said she,\n'and thou speak withouten fear;' for she saw I was in sad earnest.\n\n\"I began to quake a bit; for mind ye, she can doff freedom and don\ndignity quicker than she can slip out of her dressing-gown into kirtle\nof state. But I made my voice so soft as honey (wherefore smilest?), and\nI said 'Madam, one evening, a matter of five years agone, as ye sat\nwith your mother, the Countess of Charolois, who is now in heaven, worse\nluck, you wi' your lute, and she wi' her tapestry, or the like, do ye\nmind there came came into ye a fair youth with a letter from a painter\nbody, one Margaret Van Eyck?\"\n\n\"She said she thought she did, 'Was it not a tall youth, exceeding\ncomely?'\n\n\"'Ay, madam,' said I; 'he was my brother.'\n\n\"'Your brother?' said she, and did eye me like all over, (What dost\nsmile at?\")\n\n\"So I told her all that passed between her and Gerard, and how she was\nfor giving him a bishopric; but the good countess said, 'Gently, Marie!\nhe is too young; and with that they did both promise him a living:\n'Yet,' said I, 'he hath been a priest a long while, and no living. Hence\nmy bile.'\n\n\"'Alas!' said she, ''tis not by my good will; for all this thou hast said\nis sooth, and more. I do remember my dear mother said to me, \"See thou\nto it if I be not here.\"' So then she cried out, 'Ay, dear mother, no\nword of thine shall ever fall to the ground.'\n\n\"I, seeing her so ripe, said quickly, 'Madam, the Vicar of Gouda died\nlast week.' (For when ye seek favours of the great, behoves ye know the\nvery thing ye aim at.)\n\n\"'Then thy brother is vicar of Gouda,' quo' she, 'so sure as I am\nheiress of Burgundy and the Netherlands. Nay, thank me not, good Giles,'\nquo' she, 'but my good mother. And I do thank thee for giving of me\nsomewhat to do for her memory. And doesn't she fall a weeping for her\nmother? And doesn't that set me off a-snivelling for my good brother\nthat I love so dear, and to think that a poor little elf like me could\nyet speak in the ear of princes, and make my beautiful brother vicar of\nGouda; eh, lass, it is a bonny place, and a bonny manse, and hawthorn in\nevery bush at spring-tide, and dog-roses and eglantine in every summer\nhedge. I know what the poor fool affects, leave that to me.\"\n\nThe dwarf began his narrative strutting to and fro before Margaret, but\nhe ended it in her arms; for she could not contain herself, but caught\nhim, and embraced him warmly. \"Oh, Giles,\" she said, blushing, and\nkissing him, \"I cannot keep my hands off thee, thy body it is so little,\nand thy heart so great. Thou art his true friend. Bless thee! bless\nthee! bless thee! Now we shall see him again. We have not set eyes on\nhim since that terrible day.\"\n\n\"Gramercy, but that is strange,\" said Giles. \"Maybe he is ashamed of\nhaving cursed those two vagabones, being our own flesh and blood, worse\nluck.\"\n\n\"Think you that is why he hides?\" said Margaret eagerly;\n\n\"Ay, if he is hiding at all. However, I'll cry him by bellman.\n\n\"Nay, that might much offend him.\"\n\n\"What care I? Is Gouda to go vicarless and the manse in nettles?\"\n\nAnd to Margaret's secret satisfaction, Giles had the new vicar cried in\nRotterdam and the neighbouring towns. He easily persuaded Margaret that\nin a day or two Gerard would be sure to hear, and come to his benefice.\nShe went to look at his manse, and thought how comfortable it might be\nmade for him, and how dearly she should love to do it.\n\nBut the days rolled on, and Gerard came neither to Rotterdam nor Gouda.\nGiles was mortified, Margaret indignant, and very wretched. She said to\nherself, \"Thinking me dead, he comes home, and now, because I am alive,\nhe goes back to Italy, for that is where he has gone.\"\n\nJoan advised her to consult the hermit of Gouda.\n\n\"Why, sure he is dead by this time.\"\n\n\"Yon one, belike. But the cave is never long void; Gouda ne'er wants a\nhermit.\"\n\nBut Margaret declined to go again to Gouda on such an errand, \"What can\nhe know, shut up in a cave? less than I, belike. Gerard hath gone back\nt' Italy. He hates me for not being dead.\"\n\nPresently a Tergovian came in with a word from Catherine that Ghysbrecht\nVan Swieten had seen Gerard later than any one else. On this Margaret\ndetermined to go and see the house and goods that had been left her, and\ntake Reicht Heynes home to Rotterdam. And as may be supposed, her steps\ntook her first to Ghysbrecht's house. She found him in his garden,\nseated in a chair with wheels. He greeted her with a feeble voice, but\ncordially; and when she asked him whether it was true he had seen\nGerard since the fifth of August, he replied, \"Gerard no more, but Friar\nClement. Ay, I saw him; and blessed be the day he entered my house.\"\n\nHe then related in his own words his interview with Clement.\n\nHe told her, moreover, that the friar had afterwards acknowledged he\ncame to Tergou with the missing deed in his bosom on purpose to make him\ndisgorge her land; but that finding him disposed towards penitence, he\nhad gone to work the other way.\n\n\"Was not this a saint; who came to right thee, but must needs save his\nenemy's soul in the doing it?\"\n\nTo her question, whether he had recognized him, he said, \"I ne'er\nsuspected such a thing. 'Twas only when he had been three days with me\nthat he revealed himself, Listen while I speak my shame and his praise.\n\n\"I said to him, 'The land is gone home, and my stomach feels lighter;\nbut there is another fault that clingeth to me still;' then told I him\nof the letter I had writ at request of his brethren, I whose place it\nwas to check them. Said I, 'Yon letter was writ to part two lovers, and\nthe devil aiding, it hath done the foul work. Land and houses I can\ngive back, but yon mischief is done for ever.' 'Nay,' quoth he, 'not for\never, but for life. Repent it then while thou livest.' 'I shall,' said\nI, 'but how can God forgive it? I would not,' said I, 'were I He.'\n\n\"'Yet will He certainly forgive it,' quoth he; 'for He is ten times more\nforgiving than I am, and I forgive thee.' I stared at him; and then he\nsaid softly, but quavering like, 'Ghysbrecht, look at me closer. I am\nGerard, the son of Eli.' And I looked, and looked, and at last, lo! it\nwas Gerard. Verily I had fallen at his feet with shame and contrition,\nbut he would not suffer me. 'That became not mine years and his, for a\nparticular fault. I say not I forgive thee without a struggle,' said he,\n'not being a saint. But these three days thou hast spent in penitence,\nI have worn under thy roof in prayer; and I do forgive thee.' Those were\nhis very words.\"\n\nMargaret's tears began to flow, for it was in a broken and contrite\nvoice the old man told her this unexpected trait in her Gerard. He\ncontinued, \"And even with that he bade me farewell.\n\n\"'My work here is done now,' said he. I had not the heart to stay him;\nfor let him forgive me ever so, the sight of me must be wormwood to\nhim. He left me in peace, and may a dying man's blessing wait on him, go\nwhere he will. Oh, girl, when I think of his wrongs, and thine, and how\nhe hath avenged himself by saving this stained soul of mine, my heart is\nbroken with remorse, and these old eyes shed tears by night and day.\"\n\n\"Ghysbrecht,\" said Margaret, weeping, \"since he hath forgiven thee, I\nforgive thee too: what is done, is done; and thou hast let me know this\nday that which I had walked the world to hear. But oh, burgomaster, thou\nart an understanding man, now help a poor woman, which hath forgiven\nthee her misery.\"\n\nShe then told him all that had befallen, \"And,\" said she, \"they will not\nkeep the living for him for ever. He bids fair to lose that, as well as\nbreak all our hearts.\"\n\n\"Call my servant,\" cried the burgomaster, with sudden vigour.\n\nHe sent him for a table and writing materials, and dictated letters to\nthe burgomasters in all the principal towns in Holland, and one to a\nPrussian authority, his friend. His clerk and Margaret wrote them,\nand he signed them. \"There,\" said he, \"the matter shall be despatched\nthroughout Holland by trusty couriers, and as far as Basle in\nSwitzerland; and fear not, but we will soon have the vicar of Gouda to\nhis village.\"\n\nShe went home animated with fresh hopes, and accusing herself of\ningratitude to Gerard. \"I value my wealth now,\" said she.\n\nShe also made a resolution never to blame his conduct till she should\nhear from his own lips his reason.\n\nNot long after her return from Tergou a fresh disaster befell.\nCatherine, I must premise, had secret interviews with the black sheep,\nthe very day after they were expelled; and Cornelis followed her to\nTergou, and lived there on secret contributions, but Sybrandt chose to\nremain in Rotterdam. Ere Catherine left, she asked Margaret to lend her\ntwo gold angels. \"For,\" said she, \"all mine are spent.\" Margaret was\ndelighted to lend them or give them; but the words were scarce out of\nher mouth ere she caught a look of regret and distress on Kate's face,\nand she saw directly whither her money was going. She gave Catherine the\nmoney, and went and shut herself up with her boy. Now this money was to\nlast Sybrandt till his mother could make some good excuse for visiting\nRotterdam again, and then she would bring the idle dog some of her own\nindustrious savings.\n\nBut Sybrandt, having gold in his pocket, thought it inexhaustible: and\nbeing now under no shadow of restraint, led the life of a complete sot;\nuntil one afternoon, in a drunken frolic, he climbed on the roof of the\nstable at the inn he was carousing in, and proceeded to walk along it, a\nfeat he had performed many times when sober. But now his unsteady brain\nmade his legs unsteady, and he rolled down the roof and fell with a\nloud thwack on to an horizontal paling, where he hung a moment in a\nsemicircle; then toppled over and lay silent on the ground, amidst roars\nof laughter from his boon companions. When they came to pick him up he\ncould not stand; but fell down giggling at each attempt.\n\nOn this they went staggering and roaring down the street with him,\nand carried him at great risk of another fall to the shop in the Hoog\nStraet. For he had babbled his own shame all over the place.\n\nAs soon as he saw Margaret he hiccupped out, \"Here is the doctor that\ncures all hurts, a bonny lass.\" He also bade her observe he bore her no\nmalice, for he was paying her a visit sore against his will. \"Wherefore,\nprithee send away these drunkards, and let you and me have t'other\nglass, to drown all unkindness.\"\n\nAll this time Margaret was pale and red by turns at sight of her enemy\nand at his insolence; but one of the men whispered what had happened,\nand a streaky something in Sybrandt's face arrested her attention.\n\n\"And he cannot stand up, say you?\"\n\n\"A couldn't just now. Try, comrade! Be a man now!\"\n\n\"I am a better man than thou,\" roared Sybrandt. \"I'll stand up and fight\nye all for a crown.\"\n\nHe started to his feet, and instantly rolled into his attendant's arms\nwith a piteous groan. He then began to curse his boon companions, and\ndeclare they had stolen away his legs. \"He could feel nothing below the\nwaist.\"\n\n\"Alas, poor wretch,\" said Margaret. She turned very gravely to the men,\nand said, \"Leave him here. And if you have brought him to this, go on\nyour knees, for you have spoiled him for life. He will never walk again;\nhis back is broken.\"\n\nThe drunken man caught these words, and the foolish look of intoxication\nfled, and a glare of anguish took its place. \"The curse,\" he groaned;\n\"the curse!\"\n\nMargaret and Reicht Heynes carried him carefully, and laid him on the\nsoftest bed.\n\n\"I must do as he would do,\" whispered Margaret. \"He was kind to\nGhysbrecht.\"\n\nHer opinion was verified, Sybrandt's spine was fatally injured; and\nhe lay groaning and helpless, fed and tended by her he had so deeply\ninjured.\n\nThe news was sent to Tergou, and Catherine came over.\n\nIt was a terrible blow to her. Moreover, she accused herself as the\ncause. \"Oh, false wife; oh, weak mother,\" she cried, \"I am rightly\npunished for my treason to my poor Eli.\"\n\nShe sat for hours at a time by his bedside rocking herself in silence,\nand was never quite herself again; and the first grey hairs began to\ncome in her poor head from that hour.\n\nAs for Sybrandt, all his cry was now for Gerard, He used to whine\nto Margaret like a suffering hound, \"Oh, sweet Margaret, oh, bonny\nMargaret, for our Lady's sake find Gerard, and bid him take his curse\noff me. Thou art gentle, thou art good; thou wilt entreat for me, and he\nwill refuse thee nought.\"\n\nCatherine shared his belief that Gerard could cure him, and joined her\nentreaties to his, Margaret hardly needed this. The burgomaster and his\nagents having failed, she employed her own, and spent money like water.\nAnd among these agents poor Luke enrolled himself. She met him one day\nlooking very thin, and spoke to him compassionately. On this he began\nto blubber, and say he was more miserable than ever; he would like to be\ngood friends again upon almost any terms.\n\n\"Dear heart,\" said Margaret sorrowfully, \"why can you not say to\nyourself, now I am her little brother, and she is my old, married\nsister, worn down with care? Say so, and I will indulge thee, and pet\nthee, and make thee happier than a prince.\"\n\n\"Well, I will,\" said Luke savagely, \"sooner than keep away from you\naltogether. But above all give me something to do. Perchance I may have\nbetter luck this time.\"\n\n\"Get me my marriage lines,\" said Margaret, turning sad and gloomy in a\nmoment.\n\n\"That is as much as to say, get me him! for where they are, he is.\"\n\n\"Not so. He may refuse to come nigh me; but certes he will not deny a\npoor woman, who loved him once, her lines of betrothal. How can she go\nwithout them into any honest man's house?\"\n\n\"I'll get them you if they are in Holland,\" said Luke.\n\n\"They are as like to be in Rome,\" replied Margaret.\n\n\"Let us begin with Holland,\" observed Luke prudently.\n\nThe slave of love was furnished with money by his soft tyrant, and\nwandered hither and thither, Coopering, and carpentering, and looking\nfor Gerard. \"I can't be worse if I find the vagabone,\" said he, \"and I\nmay be a hantle better.\"\n\nThe months rolled on, and Sybrandt improved in spirit, but not in body;\nhe was Margaret's pensioner for life; and a long-expected sorrow fell\nupon poor Catherine, and left her still more bowed down; and she lost\nher fine hearty bustling way, and never went about the house singing\nnow; and her nerves were shaken, and she lived in dread of some terrible\nmisfortune falling on Cornelis. The curse was laid on him as well as\nSybrandt. She prayed Eli, if she had been a faithful partner all these\nyears, to take Cornelis into his house again, and let her live awhile at\nRotterdam.\n\n\"I have good daughters here,\" said she; \"but Margaret is so tender,\nand thoughtful, and the little Gerard, he is my joy; he grows liker his\nfather every day, and his prattle cheers my heavy heart; and I do love\nchildren.\"\n\nAnd Eli, sturdy but kindly, consented sorrowfully.\n\nAnd the people of Gouda petitioned the duke for a vicar, a real vicar.\n\"Ours cometh never nigh us,\" said they, \"this six months past; our\nchildren they die unchristened, and our folk unburied, except by some\nchance comer.\" Giles' influence baffled this just complaint once; but a\nsecond petition was prepared, and he gave Margaret little hope that the\npresent position could be maintained a single day.\n\nSo then Margaret went sorrowfully to the pretty manse to see it for the\nlast time, ere it should pass for ever into stranger's hands.\n\n\"I think he would have been happy here,\" she said, and turned heart-sick\naway.\n\nOn their return, Reicht Heynes proposed to her to go and consult the\nhermit.\n\n\"What,\" said Margaret, \"Joan has been at you. She is the one for\nhermits. I'll go, if 'tis but to show thee they know no more than we\ndo.\" And they went to the cave.\n\nIt was an excavation partly natural, partly artificial, in a bank of\nrock overgrown by brambles. There was a rough stone door on hinges, and\na little window high up, and two apertures, through one of which the\npeople announced their gifts to the hermit, and put questions of all\nsorts to him; and when he chose to answer, his voice came dissonant and\nmonstrous out at another small aperture.\n\nOn the face of the rock this line was cut--\n\nFelix qui in Domino nixus ab orbe fugit.\n\nMargaret observed to her companion that this was new since she was here\nlast.\n\n\"Ay,\" said Reicht, \"like enough;\" and looked up at it with awe. Writing\neven on paper she thought no trifle; but on rock! She whispered, \"Tis\na far holier hermit than the last; he used to come in the town now and\nthen, but this one ne'er shows his face to mortal man.\"\n\n\"And that is holiness?\"\n\n\"Ay, sure.\"\n\n\"Then what a saint a dormouse must be?\"\n\n\"Out, fie, mistress. Would ye even a beast to a man?\"\n\n\"Come, Reicht,\" said Margaret, \"my poor father taught me overmuch, So I\nwill e'en sit here, and look at the manse once more. Go thou forward and\nquestion thy solitary, and tell me whether ye get nought or nonsense\nout of him, for 'twill be one.\"\n\nAs Reicht drew near the cave a number of birds flew out of it., She gave\na little scream, and pointed to the cave to show Margaret they had come\nthence, On this Margaret felt sure there was no human being in the cave,\nand gave the matter no further attention, She fell into a deep reverie\nwhile looking at the little manse.\n\nShe was startled from it by Reicht's hand upon her shoulder, and a faint\nvoice saying, \"Let us go home.\"\n\n\"You got no answer at all, Reicht,\" said Margaret calmly.\n\n\"No, Margaret,\" said Reicht despondently. And they returned home.\n\nPerhaps after all Margaret had nourished some faint secret hope in her\nheart, though her reason had rejected it, for she certainly went home\nmore dejectedly.\n\nJust as they entered Rotterdam, Reicht said, \"Stay! Oh, Margaret, I am\nill at deceit; but 'tis death to utter ill news to thee; I love thee so\ndear.\"\n\n\"Speak out, sweetheart,\" said Margaret. \"I have gone through so much, I\nam almost past feeling any fresh trouble.\"\n\n\"Margaret, the hermit did speak to me.\"\n\n\"What, a hermit there? among all those birds.\"\n\n\"Ay; and doth not that show him a holy man?\"\n\n\"I' God's name, what said he to thee, Reicht?\"\n\n\"Alas! Margaret, I told him thy story, and I prayed him for our Lady's\nsake tell me where thy Gerard is, And I waited long for an answer, and\npresently a voice came like a trumpet: 'Pray for the soul of Gerard the\nson of Eli!\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"Oh, woe is me that I have this to tell thee, sweet Margaret! bethink\nthee thou hast thy boy to live for yet.\"\n\n\"Let me get home,\" said Margaret faintly.\n\nPassing down the Brede Kirk Straet they saw Joan at the door. Reicht\nsaid to her, \"Eh, woman, she has been to your hermit, and heard no good\nnews.\"\n\n\"Come in,\" said Joan, eager for a gossip.\n\nMargaret would not go in; but she sat down disconsolate on the lowest\nstep but one of the little external staircase that led into Joan's\nhouse, and let the other two gossip their fill at the top of it.\n\n\"Oh,\" said Joan, \"what yon hermit says is sure to be sooth, He is that\nholy, I am told, that the very birds consort with him.\"\n\n\"What does that prove?\" said Margaret deprecatingly. \"I have seen my\nGerard tame the birds in winter till they would eat from his hand.\"\n\nA look of pity at this parallel passed between the other two, but they\nwere both too fond of her to say what they thought.\n\nJoan proceeded to relate all the marvellous tales she had heard of this\nhermit's sanctity; how he never came out but at night, and prayed among\nthe wolves, and they never molested him; and now he bade the people not\nbring him so much food to pamper his body, but to bring him candles.\n\n\"The candles are to burn before his saint,\" whispered Reicht solemnly.\n\n\"Ay, lass; and to read his holy books wi'. A neighbour o' mine saw his\nhand come out, and the birds sat thereon and pecked crumbs. She went\nfor to kiss it, but the holy man whippit it away in a trice. They can't\nabide a woman to touch 'en, or even look at 'em, saints can't.\"\n\n\"What like was his hand, wife? Did you ask her?\"\n\n\"What is my tongue for, else? Why, dear heart, all one as yourn; by the\nsame token a had a thumb and four fingers.\"\n\n\"Look ye there now.\"\n\n\"But a deal whiter nor yourn and mine.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay.\"\n\n\"And main skinny.\"\n\n\"Alas.\"\n\n\"What could ye expect? Why, a live upon air, and prayer, and candles.\"\n\n\"Ah, well,\" continued Joan; \"poor thing, I whiles think 'tis best for\nher to know the worst. And now she hath gotten a voice from heaven, Or\nalmost as good, and behoves her pray for his soul. One thing, she is not\nso poor now as she was; and never fell riches to a better hand; and she\nis only come into her own for that matter, so she can pay the priest to\nsay masses for him, and that is a great comfort.\"\n\nIn the midst of their gossip, Margaret, in whose ears it was all\nbuzzing, though she seemed lost in thought, got softly up, and crept\naway with her eyes on the ground, and her brows bent.\n\n\"She hath forgotten I am with her,\" said Reicht Heynes ruefully.\n\nShe had her gossip out with Joan, and then went home.\n\nShe found Margaret seated cutting out a pelisse of grey cloth, and a\ncape to match. Little Gerard was standing at her side, inside her left\narm, eyeing the work, and making it more difficult by wriggling about,\nand fingering the arm with which she held the cloth steady, to all which\nshe submitted with imperturbable patience and complacency, Fancy a male\nworkman so entangled, impeded, worried!\n\n\"Ot's that, mammy?\"\n\n\"A pelisse, my pet.\"\n\n\"Ot's a p'lisse?\"\n\n\"A great frock. And this is the cape to't.\"\n\n\"Ot's it for?\"\n\n\"To keep his body from the cold; and the cape is for his shoulders, or\nto go over his head like the country folk. 'Tis for a hermit.\"\n\n\"Ot's a 'ermit?\"\n\n\"A holy man that lives in a cave all by himself.\"\n\n\"In de dark?\"\n\n\"Ay, whiles.\"\n\n\"Oh.\"\n\nIn the morning Reicht was sent to the hermit with the pelisse, and a\npound of thick candles.\n\nAs she was going out of the door Margaret said to her, \"Said you whose\nson Gerard was?\"\n\n\"Nay, not I.\"\n\n\"Think, girl! How could he call him Gerard, son of Eli, if you had not\ntold him?\"\n\nReicht persisted she had never mentioned him but as plain Gerard. But\nMargaret told her flatly she did not believe her; at which Reicht was\naffronted, and went out with a little toss of the head. However, she\ndetermined to question the hermit again, and did not doubt he would be\nmore liberal in his communication when he saw his nice new pelisse and\nthe candles.\n\nShe had not been gone long when Giles came in with ill news.\n\nThe living of Gouda would be kept vacant no longer.\n\nMargaret was greatly distressed at this.\n\n\"Oh, Giles,\" said she, \"ask for another month. They will give thee\nanother month, maybe.\"\n\nHe returned in an hour to tell her he could not get a month.\n\n\"They have given me a week,\" said he. \"And what is a week?\"\n\n\"Drowning bodies catch at strawen,\" was her reply. \"A week? a little\nweek?\"\n\nReicht came back from her errand out of spirits. Her oracle had declined\nall further communication. So at least its obstinate silence might\nfairly be interpreted.\n\nThe next day Margaret put Reicht in charge of the shop, and disappeared\nall day. So the next day, and so the next. Nor would she tell any one\nwhere she had been. Perhaps she was ashamed. The fact is, she spent all\nthose days on one little spot of ground. When they thought her dreaming,\nshe was applying to every word that fell from Joan and Reicht the whole\npowers of a far acuter mind than either of them possessed.\n\nShe went to work on a scale that never occurred to either of them. She\nwas determined to see the hermit, and question him face to face, not\nthrough a wall. She found that by making a circuit she could get above\nthe cave, and look down without being seen by the solitary. But when she\ncame to do it, she found an impenetrable mass of brambles. After tearing\nher clothes, and her hands and feet, so that she was soon covered with\nblood, the resolute, patient girl took out her scissors and steadily\nsnipped and cut till she made a narrow path through the enemy. But so\nslow was the work that she had to leave it half done. The next day she\nhad her scissors fresh ground, and brought a sharp knife as well, and\ngently, silently, cut her way to the roof of the cave. There she made an\nambush of some of the cut brambles, so that the passers-by might not see\nher, and couched with watchful eye till the hermit should come out. She\nheard him move underneath her. But he never left his cell. She began to\nthink it was true that he only came out at night.\n\nThe next day she came early and brought a jerkin she was making for\nlittle Gerard, and there she sat all day, working, and watching with\ndogged patience.\n\nAt four o'clock the birds began to feed; and a great many of the smaller\nkinds came fluttering round the cave, and one or two went in. But most\nof them, taking a preliminary seat on the bushes, suddenly discovered\nMargaret, and went off with an agitated flirt of their little wings. And\nalthough they sailed about in the air, they would not enter the cave.\nPresently, to encourage them, the hermit, all unconscious of the cause\nof their tremors, put out a thin white hand with a few crumbs in it,\nMargaret laid down her work softly, and gliding her body forward like a\nsnake, looked down at it from above; it was but a few feet from her. It\nwas as the woman described it, a thin, white hand.\n\nPresently the other hand came out with a piece of bread, and the two\nhands together broke it and scattered the crumbs.\n\nBut that other hand had hardly been out two seconds ere the violet eyes\nthat were watching above dilated; and the gentle bosom heaved, and the\nwhole frame quivered like a leaf in the wind.\n\nWhat her swift eye had seen I leave the reader to guess. She suppressed\nthe scream that rose to her lips, but the effort cost her dear. Soon the\nleft hand of the hermit began to swim indistinctly before her gloating\neyes; and with a deep sigh her head drooped, and she lay like a broken\nlily.\n\nShe was in a deep swoon, to which perhaps her long fast to-day and the\nagitation and sleeplessness of many preceding days contributed.\n\nAnd there lay beauty, intelligence, and constancy, pale and silent, And\nlittle that hermit guessed who was so near him. The little birds hopped\non her now, and one nearly entangled his little feet in her rich auburn\nhair.\n\nShe came back to her troubles. The sun was set. She was very cold, She\ncried a little, but I think it was partly from the remains of physical\nweakness. And then she went home, praying God and the saints to\nenlighten her and teach her what to do for the best.\n\nWhen she got home she was pale and hysterical, and would say nothing in\nanswer to all their questions but her favourite word, \"We are wading in\ndeep waters.\"\n\nThe night seemed to have done wonders for her.\n\nShe came to Catherine, who was sitting sighing by the fireside, and\nkissed her, and said--\n\n\"Mother, what would you like best in the world?\"\n\n\"Eh, dear,\" replied Catherine despondently, \"I know nought that would\nmake me smile now; I have parted from too many that were dear to me.\nGerard lost again as soon as found; Kate in heaven; and Sybrandt down\nfor life.\"\n\n\"Poor mother! Mother dear, Gouda manse is to be furnished, and cleaned,\nand made ready all in a hurry, See, here be ten gold angels. Make them\ngo far, good mother; for I have ta'en over many already from my boy for\na set of useless loons that were aye going to find him for me.\"\n\nCatherine and Reicht stared at her a moment in silence, and then out\nburst a flood of questions, to none of which would she give a reply.\n\"Nay,\" said she, \"I have lain on my bed and thought, and thought, and\nthought whiles you were all sleeping; and methinks I have got the clue\nto all, I love you, dear mother; but I'll trust no woman's tongue. If I\nfail this time, I'll have none to blame but Margaret Brandt.\"\n\nA resolute woman is a very resolute thing. And there was a deep, dogged\ndetermination in Margaret's voice and brow that at once convinced\nCatherine it would be idle to put any more questions at that time,\nShe and Reicht lost themselves in conjectures; and Catherine whispered\nReicht, \"Bide quiet; then 'twill leak out;\" a shrewd piece of advice,\nfounded on general observation.\n\nWithin an hour Catherine was on the road to Gouda in a cart, with two\nstout girls to help her, and quite a siege artillery of mops, and pails,\nand brushes, She came back with heightened colour, and something of the\nold sparkle in her eye, and kissed Margaret with a silent warmth that\nspoke volumes, and at five in the morning was off again to Gouda.\n\nThat night as Reicht was in her first sleep a hand gently pressed\nher shoulder, and she awoke, and was going to scream, \"Whisht,\" said\nMargaret, and put her finger to her lips.\n\nShe then whispered, \"Rise softly, don thy habits, and come with me!\"\n\nWhen she came down, Margaret begged her to loose Dragon and bring him\nalong. Now Dragon was a great mastiff, who had guarded Margaret Van Eyck\nand Reicht, two lone women, for some years, and was devotedly attached\nto the latter.\n\nMargaret and Reicht went out, with Dragon walking majestically behind\nthem. They came back long after midnight, and retired to rest.\n\nCatherine never knew.\n\nMargaret read her friends: she saw the sturdy, faithful Frisian could\nhold her tongue, and Catherine could not. Yet I am not sure she would\nhave trusted even Reicht had her nerve equalled her spirit; but with\nall her daring and resolution, she was a tender, timid woman, a little\nafraid of the dark, very afraid of being alone in it, and desperately\nafraid of wolves. Now Dragon could kill a wolf in a brace of shakes; but\nthen Dragon would not go with her, but only with Reicht; so altogether\nshe made one confidante.\n\nThe next night they made another moonlight reconnaissance, and as I\nthink, with some result. For not the next night (it rained that night\nand extinguished their courage), but the next after they took with them\na companion, the last in the world Reicht Heynes would have thought of;\nyet she gave her warm approval as soon as she was told he was to go with\nthem.\n\nImagine how these stealthy assailants trembled and panted when the\nmoment of action came; imagine, if you can, the tumult in Margaret's\nbreast, the thrilling hopes, chasing, and chased by sickening fears;\nthe strange and perhaps unparalleled mixture of tender familiarity and\ndistant awe with which a lovely and high-spirited, but tender, adoring\nwoman, wife in the eye of the Law, and no wife in the eye of the\nChurch, trembling, blushing, paling, glowing, shivering, stole at night,\nnoiseless as the dew, upon the hermit of Gouda.\n\nAnd the stars above seemed never so bright and calm.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCII\n\nYes, the hermit of Gouda was the vicar of Gouda, and knew it not, so\nabsolute was his seclusion.\n\nMy reader is aware that the moment the frenzy of his passion passed, he\nwas seized with remorse for having been betrayed into it. But perhaps\nonly those who have risen as high in religious spirit as he had, and\nsuddenly fallen, can realize the terror at himself that took possession\nof him. He felt like one whom self-confidence had betrayed to the very\nedge of a precipice.\n\n\"Ah, good Jerome,\" he cried, \"how much better you knew me than I knew\nmyself! How bitter yet wholesome was your admonition!\"\n\nAccustomed to search his own heart, he saw at once that the true cause\nof his fury was Margaret. \"I love her then better than God,\" said he\ndespairingly; \"better than the Church, From such a love what can spring\nto me, or to her?\" He shuddered at the thought. \"Let the strong battle\ntemptation; 'tis for the weak to flee. And who is weaker than I have\nshown myself? What is my penitence, my religion? A pack of cards built\nby degrees into a fair-seeming structure; and lo! one breath of earthly\nlove, and it lies in the dust, I must begin again, and on a surer\nfoundation.\" He resolved to leave Holland at once, and spend years of\nhis life in some distant convent before returning to it. By that time\nthe temptations of earthly passion would be doubly baffled; and older\nand a better monk, he should be more master of his earthly affections,\nand Margaret, seeing herself abandoned, would marry, and love another,\nThe very anguish this last thought cost him showed the self-searcher and\nself-denier that he was on the path of religious duty.\n\nBut in leaving her for his immortal good and hers, he was not to\nneglect her temporal weal. Indeed, the sweet thought, he could make her\ncomfortable for life, and rich in this world's goods, which she was not\nbound to despise, sustained him in the bitter struggle it cost him to\nturn his back on her without one kind word or look, \"Oh, what will she\nthink of me?\" he groaned. \"Shall I not seem to her of all creatures the\nmost heartless, inhuman? but so best; ay, better she should hate me,\nmiserable that I am, Heaven is merciful, and giveth my broken heart this\ncomfort; I can make that villain restore her own, and she shall never\nlose another true lover by poverty. Another? Ah me! ah me! God and the\nsaints to mine aid!\"\n\nHow he fared on this errand has been related. But first, as you may\nperhaps remember, he went at night to shrive the hermit of Gouda. He\nfound him dying, and never left him till he had closed his eyes and\nburied him beneath the floor of the little oratory attached to his cell.\nIt was the peaceful end of a stormy life. The hermit had been a soldier,\nand even now carried a steel corselet next his skin, saying he was now\nChrist's soldier as he had been Satan's. When Clement had shriven him\nand prayed by him, he, in his turn, sought counsel of one who was dying\nin so pious a frame, The hermit advised him to be his successor in this\npeaceful retreat. \"His had been a hard fight against the world, the\nflesh, and the devil, and he had never thoroughly baffled them till he\nretired into the citadel of Solitude.\"\n\nThese words and the hermit's pious and peaceful death, which speedily\nfollowed, and set as it were the seal of immortal truth on them, made a\ndeep impression upon Clement. Nor in his case had they any prejudice to\ncombat; the solitary recluse was still profoundly revered in the Church,\nwhether immured as an anchorite or anchoress in some cave or cell\nbelonging to a monastery, or hidden in the more savage but laxer\nseclusion of the independent hermitage. And Clement knew more about the\nhermits of the Church than most divines at his time of life; he had read\nmuch thereon at the monastery near Tergou, had devoured their lives\nwith wonder and delight in the manuscripts of the Vatican, and conversed\nearnestly about them with the mendicant friars of several nations.\nBefore Printing these friars were the great circulators of those local\nannals and biographies which accumulated in the convents of every land.\nThen his teacher, Jerome, had been three years an anchorite on the\nheights of Camaldoli, where for more than four centuries the Thebaid had\nbeen revived; and Jerome, cold and curt on most religious themes, was\nwarm with enthusiasm on this one. He had pored over the annals of\nSt. John Baptist's abbey, round about which the hermit's caves were\nscattered, and told him the names of many a noble, and many a famous\nwarrior who had ended his days there a hermit, and of many a bishop and\narchbishop who had passed from the see to the hermitage, or from the\nhermitage to the see. Among the former the Archbishop of Ravenna; among\nthe latter Pope Victor the Ninth. He told him too, with grim delight, of\ntheir multifarious austerities, and how each hermit set himself to find\nwhere he was weakest, and attacked himself without mercy or remission\ntill there, even there, he was strongest. And how seven times in the\ntwenty-four hours, in thunder, rain, or snow, by daylight, twilight,\nmoonlight, or torchlight, the solitaries flocked from distant points,\nover rugged precipitous ways, to worship in the convent church; at\nmatins, at prime, tierce, sexte, nones, vespers, and compline. He\neven, under eager questioning, described to him the persons of famous\nanchorites he had sung the Psalter and prayed with there; the only\nintercourse their vows allowed, except with special permission. Moncata,\nDuke of Moncata and Cardova, and Hidalgo of Spain, who in the flower of\nhis youth had retired thither from the pomps, vanities, and pleasures of\nthe world; Father John Baptist of Novara, who had led armies to\nbattle, but was now a private soldier of Christ; Cornelius, Samuel,\nand Sylvanus. This last, when the great Duchess de' Medici obtained the\nPope's leave, hitherto refused, to visit Camaldoli, went down and met\nher at the first wooden cross, and there, surrounded as she was with\ncourtiers and flatterers, remonstrated with her, and persuaded her, and\nwarned her, not to profane that holy mountain, where no woman for so\nmany centuries had placed her foot; and she, awed by the place and the\nman, retreated with all her captains, soldiers, courtiers, and pages\nfrom that one hoary hermit. At Basle Clement found fresh materials,\nespecially with respect to German and English anchorites; and he had\neven prepared a \"Catena Eremitarum\" from the year of our Lord 250, when\nPaul of Thebes commenced his ninety years of solitude, down to the year\n1470. He called them Angelorum amici et animalium, i.e.\n\nFRIENDS OF ANGELS AND ANIMALS.\n\nThus, though in those days he never thought to be a recluse, the road\nwas paved, so to speak; and when the dying hermit of Gouda blessed the\ncitadel of Solitude, where he had fought the good fight and won it, and\ninvited him to take up the breast-plate of faith that now fell off his\nown shrunken body, Clement said within himself: \"Heaven itself led my\nfoot hither to this end.\" It struck him, too, as no small coincidence\nthat his patron, St. Bavon, was a hermit, and an austere one, a\ncuirassier of the solitary cell.\n\nAs soon as he was reconciled to Ghysbrecht Van Swieten, he went eagerly\nto his abode, praying Heaven it might not have been already occupied in\nthese three days. The fear was not vain; these famous dens never wanted\na human tenant long. He found the rude stone door ajar; then he made\nsure he was too late; he opened the door and went softly in. No; the\ncell was vacant, and there were the hermit's great ivory crucifix, his\npens, ink, seeds, and, memento mori, a skull; his cilice of hair, and\nanother of bristles; his well-worn sheepskin pelisse and hood; his\nhammer, chisel, and psaltery, etc. Men and women had passed that\nway, but none had ventured to intrude, far less to steal. Faith and\nsimplicity had guarded that keyless door more securely than the houses\nof the laity were defended by their gates like a modern gaol, and think\niron bars at every window, and the gentry by moat, bastion, chevaux de\nfrise, and portcullis.\n\nAs soon as Clement was fairly in the cell there was a loud flap, and a\nflutter, and down came a great brown owl from a corner, and whirled out\nof the window, driving the air cold on Clement's face, He started and\nshuddered.\n\nWas this seeming owl something diabolical? trying to deter him from his\nsoul's good? On second thoughts, might it not be some good spirit\nthe hermit had employed to keep the cell for him, perhaps the hermit\nhimself? Finally he concluded that it was just an owl, and that he would\ntry and make friends with it.\n\nHe kneeled down and inaugurated his new life with prayer.\n\nClement had not only an earthly passion to quell, the power of which\nmade him tremble for his eternal weal, but he had a penance to do for\nhaving given way to ire, his besetting sin, and cursed his own brothers.\n\nHe looked round this roomy cell furnished with so many comforts, and\ncompared it with the pictures in his mind of the hideous place, eremus\nin eremo, a desert in a desert, where holy Jerome, hermit, and the\nPlutarch of hermits, had wrestled with sickness, temptation, and despair\nfour mortal years; and with the inaccessible and thorny niche, a hole\nin a precipice, where the boy hermit Benedict buried himself, and lived\nthree years on the pittance the good monk Romanus could spare him from\nhis scanty commons, and subdivided that mouthful with his friend, a\nraven; and the hollow tree of his patron St. Bavon; and the earthly\npurgatory at Fribourg, where lived a nameless saint in a horrid cavern,\nhis eyes chilled with perpetual gloom, and his ears stunned with an\neternal waterfall; and the pillar on which St. Simeon Stylita existed\nforty-five years; and the destina, or stone box, of St. Dunstan, where,\nlike Hilarion in his bulrush hive, sepulchro potius quam domu, he could\nscarce sit, stand, or lie; and the living tombs, sealed with lead, of\nThais, and Christina, and other recluses; and the damp dungeon of St.\nAlred. These and scores more of the dismal dens in which true hermits\nhad worn out their wasted bodies on the rock, and the rock under their\nsleeping bodies, and their praying knees, all came into his mind, and he\nsaid to himself, \"This sweet retreat is for safety of the soul; but what\nfor penance Jesu aid me against faults to come; and for the fault I rue,\nface of man I will not see for a twelvemonth and a day.\" He had famous\nprecedents in his eye even for this last and unusual severity. In fact\nthe original hermit of this very cell was clearly under the same vow.\nHence the two apertures, through which he was spoken to, and replied.\n\nAdopting, in other respects, the uniform rule of hermits and anchorites,\nhe divided his day into the seven offices, ignoring the petty\naccidents of light and dark, creations both of Him to whom he prayed so\nunceasingly. He learned the psalter by heart, and in all the intervals\nof devotion, not occupied by broken slumbers, he worked hard with his\nhands. No article of the hermit's rule was more strict or more ancient\nthan this. And here his self-imposed penance embarrassed him, for\nwhat work could he do, without being seen, that should benefit his\nneighbours? for the hermit was to labour for himself in those cases only\nwhere his subsistence depended on it. Now Clement's modest needs were\namply supplied by the villagers.\n\nOn moonlight nights he would steal out like a thief, and dig some\npoor man's garden on the outskirts of the village. He made baskets and\ndropped them slily at humble doors.\n\nAnd since he could do nothing for the bodies of those who passed by his\ncell in daytime, he went out in the dead of the night with his hammer\nand his chisel, and carved moral and religious sentences all down the\nroad upon the sandstone rocks. \"Who knows?\" said he, \"often a chance\nshaft strikes home.\"\n\nOh, sore heart, comfort thou the poor and bereaved with holy words of\nsolace in their native tongue; for he said \"well, 'tis 'clavis ad corda\nplebis.'\" Also he remembered the learned Colonna had told him of\nthe written mountains in the east, where kings had inscribed their\nvictories, \"What,\" said Clement, \"are they so wise, those Eastern\nmonarchs, to engrave their war-like glory upon the rock, making a blood\nbubble endure so long as earth; and shall I leave the rocks about me\nsilent on the King of Glory, at whose word they were, and at whose\nbreath they shall be dust? Nay, but these stones shall speak to weary\nwayfarers of eternal peace, and of the Lamb, whose frail and afflicted\nyet happy servant worketh them among.\"\n\nNow at this time the inspired words that have consoled the poor and the\nafflicted for so many ages were not yet printed in Dutch, so that these\nsentences of gold from the holy evangelists came like fresh oracles\nfrom heaven, or like the dew on parched flowers; and the poor hermit's\nwritten rocks softened a heart Or two, and sent the heavy laden singing\non their way(1).\n\nThese holy oracles that seemed to spring up around him like magic; his\nprudent answers through his window to such as sought ghostly counsel;\nand above all, his invisibility, soon gained him a prodigious\nreputation, This was not diminished by the medical advice they now and\nthen extorted from him sore against his will, by tears and entreaties;\nfor if the patients got well they gave the holy hermit the credit, and\nif not they laid all the blame on the devil. \"I think he killed nobody,\nfor his remedies were womanish and weak.\" Sage and wormwood, sion,\nhyssop, borage, spikenard, dog's-tongue, our Lady's mantle, feverfew,\nand Faith, and all in small quantities except the last.\n\nThen his abstinence, sure sign of a saint. The eggs and milk they\nbrought him at first he refused with horror. Know ye not the hermit's\nrule is bread, or herbs, and water? Eggs, they are birds in disguise;\nfor when the bird dieth, then the egg rotteth. As for milk, it is little\nbetter than white blood. And when they brought him too much bread he\nrefused it. Then they used to press it on him. \"Nay, holy father; give\nthe overplus to the poor.\"\n\n\"You who go among the poor can do that better. Is bread a thing to fling\nhaphazard from an hermit's window?\" And to those who persisted after\nthis: \"To live on charity, yet play Sir Bountiful, is to lie with the\nright hand. Giving another's to the poor, I should beguile them of their\nthanks, and cheat thee the true giver. Thus do thieves, whose boast it\nis they bleed the rich into the lap of the poor. Occasio avaritiae nomen\npauperum.\"\n\nWhen nothing else would convince the good souls, this piece of Latin\nalways brought them round. So would a line of Virgil's Aeneid.\n\nThis great reputation of sanctity was all external. Inside the cell was\na man who held the hermit of Gouda as cheap as dirt.\n\n\"Ah!\" said he, \"I cannot deceive myself; I cannot deceive God's animals.\nSee the little birds, how coy they be; I feed and feed them, and long\nfor their friendship, yet will they never come within, nor take my hand,\nby lighting on't. For why? No Paul, no Benedict, no Hugh of Lincoln, no\nColumba, no Guthlac bides in this cell. Hunted doe flieth not hither,\nfor here is no Fructuosus, nor Aventine, nor Albert of Suabia; nor e'en\na pretty squirrel cometh from the wood hard by for the acorns I have\nhoarded; for here abideth no Columban. The very owl that was here hath\nfled. They are not to be deceived; I have a Pope's word for that; Heaven\nrest his soul.\"\n\nClement had one advantage over her whose image in his heart he was bent\non destroying.\n\nHe had suffered and survived the pang of bereavement, and the mind\ncannot quite repeat such anguish. Then he had built up a habit of\nlooking on her as dead. After that strange scene in the church and\nchurchyard of St. Laurens, that habit might be compared to a structure\nriven by a thunderbolt. It was shattered, but stones enough stood to\nfound a similar habit on; to look on her as dead to him.\n\nAnd by severe subdivision of his time and thoughts, by unceasing prayers\nand manual labour, he did in about three months succeed in benumbing the\nearthly half of his heart.\n\nBut lo! within a day or two of this first symptom of mental peace\nreturning slowly, there descended upon his mind a horrible despondency.\n\nWords cannot utter it, for words never yet painted a likeness of\ndespair. Voices seemed to whisper in his ear, \"Kill thyself! kill! kill!\nkill!\"\n\nAnd he longed to obey the voices, for life was intolerable.\n\nHe wrestled with his dark enemy with prayers and tears; he prayed God\nbut to vary his temptation. \"Oh let mine enemy have power to scourge me\nwith red-hot whips, to tear me leagues and leagues over rugged places\nby the hair of my head, as he has served many a holy hermit, that yet\nbaffled him at last; to fly on me like a raging lion; to gnaw me with\na serpent's fangs; any pain, any terror, but this horrible gloom of the\nsoul that shuts me from all light of Thee and of the saints.\"\n\nAnd now a freezing thought crossed him. What if the triumphs of the\npowers of darkness over Christian souls in desert places had been\nsuppressed, and only their defeats recorded, or at least in full; for\ndark hints were scattered about antiquity that now first began to grin\nat him with terrible meaning.\n\n\"THEY WANDERED IN THE DESERT AND PERISHED BY SERPENTS,\" said an ancient\nfather of hermits that went into solitude, \"and were seen no more.\" And\nanother at a more recent epoch wrote: Vertuntur ad melancholiam: \"they\nturn to gloomy madness.\" These two statements, were they not one? for\nthe ancient fathers never spoke with regret of the death of the body.\nNo, the hermits so lost were perished souls, and the serpents were\ndiabolical (2) thoughts, the natural brood of solitude.\n\nSt. Jerome went into the desert with three companions; one fled in the\nfirst year, two died; how? The single one that lasted was a gigantic\nsoul with an iron body.\n\nThe cotemporary who related this made no comment, expressed no wonder,\nWhat, then, if here was a glimpse of the true proportion in every age,\nand many souls had always been lost in solitude for one gigantic mind\nand iron body that survived this terrible ordeal.\n\nThe darkened recluse now cast his despairing eyes over antiquity to see\nwhat weapons the Christian arsenal contained that might befriend him.\nThe greatest of all was prayer. Alas! it was a part of his malady to\nbe unable to pray with true fervour. The very system of mechanical\nsupplication he had for months carried out so severely by rule had\nrather checked than fostered his power of originating true prayer.\n\nHe prayed louder than ever, but the heart hung back cold and gloomy, and\nlet the words go up alone.\n\n\"Poor wingless prayers,\" he cried, \"you will not get half-way to\nheaven.\"\n\nA fiend of this complexion had been driven out of King Saul by music.\n\nClement took up the hermit's psaltery, and with much trouble mended the\nstrings and tuned it.\n\nNo, he could not play it. His soul was so out of tune. The sounds jarred\non it, and made him almost mad.\n\n\"Ah, wretched me!\" he cried; \"Saul had a saint to play to him. He was\nnot alone with the spirits of darkness; but here is no sweet bard of\nIsrael to play to me; I, lonely, with crushed heart, on which a black\nfiend sitteth mountain high, must make the music to uplift that heart\nto heaven; it may not be.\" And he grovelled on the earth weeping and\ntearing his hair.\n\nVERTEBATUR AD MELANCHOLIAM.\n\n     (1) It requires nowadays a strong effort of the imagination\n     to realize the effect on poor people who had never seen them\n     before of such sentences as this\n\n     \"Blessed are the poor\" etc.\n\n     (2) The primitive writer was so interpreted by others\n     besides Clement; and in particular by Peter of Blois, a\n     divine of the twelfth century, whose comment is noteworthy,\n     as he himself was a forty-year hermit.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCIII\n\nOne day as he lay there sighing and groaning, prayerless, tuneless,\nhopeless, a thought flashed into his mind. What he had done for the\npoor and the wayfarer, he would do for himself. He would fill his den of\ndespair with the name of God and the magic words of holy writ, and the\npious, prayerful consolations of the Church.\n\nThen, like Christian at Apollyon's feet, he reached his hand suddenly\nout and caught, not his sword, for he had none, but peaceful labour's\nhumbler weapon, his chisel, and worked with it as if his soul depended\non his arm.\n\nThey say that Michael Angelo in the next generation used to carve\nstatues, not like our timid sculptors, by modelling the work in clay,\nand then setting a mechanic to chisel it, but would seize the block,\nconceive the image, and at once, with mallet and steel, make the marble\nchips fly like mad about him, and the mass sprout into form. Even so\nClement drew no lines to guide his hand. He went to his memory for the\ngracious words, and then dashed at his work and eagerly graved them in\nthe soft stone, between working and fighting.\n\nHe begged his visitors for candle ends, and rancid oil.\n\n\"Anything is good enough for me,\" he said, \"if 'twill but burn.\" So at\nnight the cave glowed afar off like a blacksmith's forge, through the\nwindow and the gaping chinks of the rude stone door, and the rustics\nbeholding crossed themselves and suspected deviltries, and within the\nholy talismans, one after another, came upon the walls, and the sparks\nand the chips flew day and night, night and day, as the soldier of\nSolitude and of the Church plied, with sighs and groans, his bloodless\nweapon, between working and fighting.\n\nKyrie Eleison.\n\nChriste Eleison.\n\n{ton Satanan suntripson upo tous pothas ymwn}(1)\n\nSursum Corda.(2)\n\nDeus Refugium nostrum et virtus.(3)\n\nAgnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi miserere mihi.(4)\n\nSancta Trinitas unus Deus, miserere nobis.(5)\n\nAb infestationibus Daemonum, a ventura ira, a damnatione perpetua.\nLibera nos Domine.(6)\n\nDeus, qui miro ordine Angelorum ministeria, etc, (the whole collect).(7)\n\nQuem quaerimus adjutorem nisi te Domine qui pro peccatis nostris juste\nirascaris? (8)\n\nSancte Deus, Sancte fortis, Sancte et misericors Salvator, amarae morti\nne tradas nos.\n\nAnd underneath the great crucifix, which was fastened to the wall, he\ngraved this from Augustine:\n\nO anima Christiana, respice vulnera patientis, sanguinem morientis,\npretium redemptionis. Haec quanta sint cogitate, et in statera mentis\nvestrae appendite, ut totus vobis figatur in corde, qui pro vobis totus\nfixus est in cruce. Nam si passio Christi ad memoriam revocetur, nihil\nest tam durum quod non aequo animo toleretur.\n\nWhich may be thus rendered: O Christian soul, look on the wounds of\nthe suffering One, the blood of the dying One, the price paid for our\nredemption! These things, oh, think how great they be, and weigh them in\nthe balance of thy mind: that He may be wholly nailed to thy heart,\nwho for thee was all nailed unto the cross. For do but call to mind the\nsufferings of Christ, and there is nought on earth too hard to endure\nwith composure.\n\nSoothed a little, a very little, by the sweet and pious words he was\nraising all round him, and weighed down with watching and working night\nand day, Clement one morning sank prostrate with fatigue, and a deep\nsleep overpowered him for many hours. Awaking quietly, he heard a little\ncheep; he opened his eyes, and lo! upon his breviary, which was on a low\nstool near his feet, ruffling all his feathers with a single pull, and\nsmoothing them as suddenly, and cocking his bill this way and that with\na vast display of cunning purely imaginary, perched a robin redbreast.\n\nClement held his breath.\n\nHe half closed his eyes lest they should frighten the airy guest.\n\nDown came robin on the floor.\n\nWhen there he went through his pantomime of astuteness; and then,\npim, pim, pim, with three stiff little hops, like a ball of worsted on\nvertical wires, he was on the hermit's bare foot. On this eminence he\nswelled and contracted again, with ebb and flow of feathers; but Clement\nlost this, for he quite closed his eyes and scarce drew his breath in\nfear of frightening and losing his visitor. He was content to feel the\nminute claw on his foot. He could but just feel it, and that by help of\nknowing it was there.\n\nPresently a little flirt with two little wings, and the feathered\nbusybody was on the breviary again.\n\nThen Clement determined to try and feed this pretty little fidget\nwithout frightening it away. But it was very difficult.\n\nHe had a piece of bread within reach, but how get at it? I think he was\nfive minutes creeping his hand up to that bread, and when there he must\nnot move his arm.\n\nHe slily got a crumb between a finger and thumb and shot it as boys do\nmarbles, keeping the hand quite still.\n\nCockrobin saw it fall near him, and did sagacity, but moved not.\n\nWhen another followed, and then another, he popped down and caught up\none of the crumbs, but not quite understanding this mystery fled with\nit, for more security, to an eminence; to wit, the hermit's knee.\n\nAnd so the game proceeded till a much larger fragment than usual rolled\nalong.\n\nHere was a prize. Cockrobin pounced on it, bore it aloft, and fled so\nswiftly into the world with it, the cave resounded with the buffeted\nair.\n\n\"Now, bless thee, sweet bird,\" sighed the stricken solitary; \"thy wings\nare music, and thou a feathered ray camedst to light my darkened soul.\"\n\nAnd from that to his orisons, and then to his tools with a little bit of\ncourage, and this was his day's work:\n\n     Veni, Creator Spiritus,\n     Mentes tuorem visita,\n     Imple superna gratia\n     Quae tu creasti pectora\n\n     Accende lumen sensibus,\n     Mentes tuorum visita,\n     Infirma nostri corporis,\n     Virtute firmans perpeti.\n\nAnd so the days rolled on; and the weather got colder, and Clement's\nheart got warmer, and despondency was rolling away; and by-and-by,\nsomehow or another, it was gone. He had outlived it.\n\nIt had come like a cloud, and it went like one.\n\nAnd presently all was reversed; his cell seemed illuminated with joy.\nHis work pleased him; his prayers were full of unction; his psalms of\npraise. Hosts of little birds followed their crimson leader, and flying\nfrom snow, and a parish full of Cains, made friends one after another\nwith Abel; fast friends. And one keen frosty night as he sang the\npraises of God to his tuneful psaltery, and his hollow cave rang forth\nthe holy psalmody upon the night, as if that cave itself was Tubal's\nsurrounding shell, or David's harp, he heard a clear whine, not\nunmelodious; it became louder and less in tune. He peeped through\nthe chinks of his rude door, and there sat a great red wolf moaning\nmelodiously with his nose high in the air.\n\nClement was rejoiced. \"My sins are going,\" he cried, \"and the creatures\nof God are owning me, one after another.\" And in a burst of enthusiasm\nhe struck up the laud:\n\n\"Praise Him all ye creatures of His!\n\n\"Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord.\"\n\nAnd all the time he sang the wolf bayed at intervals.\n\nBut above all he seemed now to be drawing nearer to that celestial\nintercourse which was the sign and the bliss of the true hermit; for he\nhad dreams about the saints and angels, so vivid, they were more like\nvisions. He saw bright figures clad in woven snow. They bent on him eyes\nlovelier than those of the antelope's he had seen at Rome, and fanned\nhim with broad wings hued like the rainbow, and their gentle voices bade\nhim speed upon his course.\n\nHe had not long enjoyed this felicity when his dreams began to take\nanother and a strange complexion. He wandered with Fra Colonna over the\nrelics of antique nations, and the friar was lame and had a staff,\nand this staff he waved over the mighty ruins, and were they Egyptian,\nGreek, or Roman, straightway the temples and palaces, whose wrecks they\nwere, rose again like an exhalation, and were thronged with the famous\ndead. Songsters that might have eclipsed both Apollo and his rival\npoured forth their lays; women, god-like in form, and draped like\nMinerva, swam round the marble courts in voluptuous but easy and\ngraceful dances. Here sculptors carved away amidst admiring pupils, and\nforms of supernatural beauty grew out of Parian marble in a quarter of\nan hour; and grave philosophers conversed on high and subtle matters,\nwith youth listening reverently; it was a long time ago. And still\nbeneath all this wonderful panorama a sort of suspicion or expectation\nlurked in the dreamer's mind. \"This is a prologue, a flourish, there is\nsomething behind; something that means me no good, something mysterious,\nawful.\"\n\nAnd one night that the wizard Colonna had transcended himself, he\npointed with his stick, and there was a swallowing up of many great\nancient cities, and the pair stood on a vast sandy plain with a huge\ncrimson sun sinking to rest, There were great palm-trees; and there\nwere bulrush hives, scarce a man's height, dotted all about to the sandy\nhorizon, and the crimson sun.\n\n\"These are the anchorites of the Theban desert,\" said Colonna calmly;\n\"followers not of Christ and His apostles, and the great fathers, but\nof the Greek pupils of the Egyptian pupils of the Brachmans and\nGymnosophists.\"\n\nAnd Clement thought that he burned to go and embrace the holy men and\ntell them his troubles, and seek their advice. But he was tied by the\nfeet somehow, and could not move, and the crimson sun sank, and it got\ndusk, and the hives scarce visible, And Colonna's figure became shadowy\nand shapeless, but his eyes glowed ten times brighter; and this thing\nall eyes spoke and said: \"Nay, let them be, a pack of fools I see how\ndismal it all is.\" Then with a sudden sprightliness, \"But I hear one of\nthem has a manuscript of Petronius, on papyrus; I go to buy it; farewell\nfor ever, for ever, for ever.\"\n\nAnd it was pitch dark, and a light came at Clement's back like a gentle\nstroke, a glorious roseate light. It warmed as well as brightened. It\nloosened his feet from the ground; he turned round, and there, her face\nirradiated with sunshine, and her hair glittering like the gloriola of a\nsaint, was Margaret Brandt.\n\nShe blushed and smiled and cast a look of ineffable tenderness on him,\n\"Gerard,\" she murmured, \"be whose thou wilt by day, but at night be\nmine!\"\n\nEven as she spoke, the agitation of seeing her so suddenly awakened him,\nand he found himself lying trembling from head to foot.\n\nThat radiant figure and mellow voice seemed to have struck his nightly\nkeynote.\n\nAwake he could pray, and praise, and worship God; he was master of his\nthoughts. But if he closed his eyes in sleep, Margaret, or Satan in her\nshape, beset him, a seeming angel of light. He might dream of a thousand\ndifferent things, wide as the poles asunder, ere he woke the imperial\nfigure was sure to come and extinguish all the rest in a moment, stellas\nexortus uti aetherius sol; for she came glowing with two beauties never\nbefore united, an angel's radiance and a woman's blushes.\n\nAngels cannot blush. So he knew it was a fiend.\n\nHe was alarmed, but not so much surprised as at the demon's last\nartifice. From Anthony to Nicholas of the Rock scarce hermit that had\nnot been thus beset; sometimes with gay voluptuous visions, sometimes\nwith lovely phantoms, warm, tangible, and womanly without, demons\nwithin, nor always baffled even by the saints. Witness that \"angel form\nwith a devil's heart\" that came hanging its lovely head, like a bruised\nflower, to St. Macarius, with a feigned tale, and wept, and wept, and\nwept, and beguiled him first of his tears and then of half his virtue.\n\nBut with the examples of Satanic power and craft had come down copious\nrecords of the hermits' triumphs and the weapons by which they had\nconquered.\n\nDomandum est Corpus; the body must be tamed; this had been their\nwatchword for twelve hundred years. It was a tremendous war-cry; for\nthey called the earthly affections, as well as appetites, body, and\ncrushed the whole heart through the suffering and mortified flesh.\n\nClement then said to himself that the great enemy of man had retired\nbut to spring with more effect, and had allowed him a few days of\ntrue purity and joy only to put him off his guard against the soft\nblandishments he was pouring over the soul that had survived the\nbuffeting of his black wings. He applied himself to tame the body, he\nshortened his sleep, lengthened his prayers, and increased his severe\ntemperance to abstinence. Hitherto, following the ordinary rule, he had\neaten only at sunset. Now he ate but once in forty-eight hours, drinking\na little water every day.\n\nOn this the visions became more distinct.\n\nThen he flew to a famous antidote, to \"the grand febrifuge\" of\nanchorites--cold water.\n\nHe found the deepest part of the stream that ran by his cell; it rose\nnot far off at a holy well; and clearing the bottom of the large stones,\nmade a hole where he could stand in water to the chin, and fortified by\nso many examples, he sprang from his rude bed upon the next diabolical\nassault, and entered the icy water.\n\nIt made him gasp and almost shriek with the cold. It froze his marrow.\n\"I shall die,\" he cried, \"I shall die; but better this than fire\neternal.\"\n\nAnd the next day he was so stiff in all his joints he could not move,\nand he seemed one great ache. And even in sleep he felt that his very\nbones were like so many raging teeth, till the phantom he dreaded came\nand gave one pitying smile, and all the pain was gone.\n\nThen, feeling that to go into the icy water again, enfeebled by fasts\nas he was, might perhaps carry the guilt of suicide, he scourged himself\ntill the blood ran, and so lay down smarting. And when exhaustion began\nto blunt the smart down to a throb, that moment the present was away,\nand the past came smiling back. He sat with Margaret at the duke's\nfeast, the minstrels played divinely, and the purple fountains gushed.\nYouth and love reigned in each heart, and perfumed the very air.\n\nThen the scene shifted, and they stood at the altar together man and\nwife. And no interruption this time, and they wandered hand in hand, and\ntold each other their horrible dreams. As for him, \"he had dreamed she\nwas dead, and he was a monk; and really the dream had been so vivid and\nso full of particulars that only his eyesight could even now convince\nhim it was only a dream, and they were really one.\"\n\nAnd this new keynote once struck, every tune ran upon it. Awake he\nwas Clement the hermit, risen from unearthly visions of the night, as\ndangerous as they were sweet; asleep he was Gerard Eliassoen, the happy\nhusband of the loveliest and best, and truest girl in Holland: all the\nhappier that he had been for some time the sport of hideous dreams, in\nwhich he had lost her.\n\nHis constant fasts, coupled with other austerities, and the deep mental\nanxiety of a man fighting with a supernatural foe, had now reduced\nhim nearly to a skeleton; but still on those aching bones hung flesh\nunsubdued, and quivering with an earthly passion; so, however, he\nthought; \"or why had ill spirits such power over him?\" His opinion was\nconfirmed, when one day he detected himself sinking to sleep actually\nwith a feeling of complacency, because now Margaret would come and he\nshould feel no more pain, and the unreal would be real, and the real\nunreal, for an hour.\n\nOn this he rose hastily with a cry of dismay, and stripping to the skin\nclimbed up to the brambles above his cave, and flung himself on them,\nand rolled on them writhing with the pain: then he came into his den a\nmass of gore, and lay moaning for hours; till, out of sheer exhaustion,\nhe fell into a deep and dreamless sleep.\n\nHe awoke to bodily pain, and mental exultation; he had broken the fatal\nspell. Yes, it was broken; another and another day passed, and her image\nmolested him no more. But he caught himself sighing at his victory.\n\nThe birds got tamer and tamer, they perched upon his hand. Two of them\nlet him gild their little claws. Eating but once in two days he had more\nto give them.\n\nHis tranquility was not to last long.\n\nA woman's voice came in from the outside, told him his own story in a\nvery few words, and asked him to tell her where Gerard was to be found.\n\nHe was so astounded he could only say, with an instinct of self-defence,\n\"Pray for the soul of Gerard the son of Eli!\" meaning that he was dead\nto the world. And he sat wondering.\n\nWhen the woman was gone, he determined, after an inward battle, to risk\nbeing seen, and he peeped after her to see who it could be; but he took\nso many precautions, and she ran so quickly back to her friend, that the\nroad was clear.\n\n\"Satan!\" said he directly.\n\nAnd that night back came his visions of earthly love and happiness so\nvividly, he could count every auburn hair in Margaret's head, and see\nthe pupils of her eyes.\n\nThen he began to despair, and said, \"I must leave this country; here I\nam bound fast in memory's chain;\" and began to dread his cell. He said,\n\"A breath from hell hath infected it, and robbed even these holy words\nof their virtue.\" And unconsciously imitating St. Jerome, a victim\nof earthly hallucinations, as overpowering, and coarser, he took his\nwarmest covering out into the wood hard by, and there flung down under\na tree that torn and wrinkled leather bag of bones, which a little ago\nmight have served a sculptor for Apollo.\n\nWhether the fever of his imagination intermitted, as a master mind of\nour day has shown that all things intermit(9) or that this really broke\nsome subtle link, I know not, but his sleep was dreamless.\n\nHe awoke nearly frozen, but warm with joy within.\n\n\"I shall yet be a true hermit, Dei gratia,\" said he.\n\nThe next day some good soul left on his little platform a new lambs-wool\npelisse and cape, warm, soft, and ample.\n\nHe had a moment's misgiving on account of its delicious softness and\nwarmth; but that passed. It was the right skin(10), and a mark that\nHeaven approved his present course.\n\nIt restored warmth to his bones after he came in from his short rest.\n\nAnd now, at one moment he saw victory before him if he could but live\nto it; at another, he said to himself, \"'Tis but another lull; be on thy\nguard, Clement.\"\n\nAnd this thought agitated his nerves and kept him in continual awe.\n\nHe was like a soldier within the enemy's lines.\n\nOne night, a beautiful clear frosty night, he came back to his cell,\nafter a short rest. The stars were wonderful. Heaven seemed a thousand\ntimes larger as well as brighter than earth, and to look with a thousand\neyes instead of one.\n\n\"Oh, wonderful,\" he cried, \"that there should be men who do crimes by\nnight; and others scarce less mad, who live for this little world, and\nnot for that great and glorious one, which nightly, to all eyes not\nblinded by custom, reveals its glowing glories. Thank God I am a\nhermit.\"\n\nAnd in this mood he came to his cell door.\n\nHe paused at it; it was closed.\n\n\"Why, methought I left it open,\" said he, \"The wind. There is not a\nbreath of wind. What means this?\"\n\nHe stood with his hand upon the rugged door. He looked through one of\nthe great chinks, for it was much smaller in places than the aperture\nit pretended to close, and saw his little oil wick burning just where he\nhad left it.\n\n\"How is it with me,\" he sighed, \"when I start and tremble at nothing?\nEither I did shut it, or the fiend hath shut it after me to disturb my\nhappy soul. Retro Sathanas!\"\n\nAnd he entered his cave rapidly, and began with somewhat nervous\nexpedition to light one of his largest tapers. While he was lighting it,\nthere was a soft sigh in the cave.\n\nHe started and dropped the candle just as it was lighting, and it went\nout.\n\nHe stooped for it hurriedly and lighted it, listening intently.\n\nWhen it was lighted he shaded it with his hand from behind, and threw\nthe faint light all round the cell.\n\nIn the farthest corner the outline of the wall seemed broken.\n\nHe took a step towards the place with his heart beating.\n\nThe candle at the same time getting brighter, he saw it was the figure\nof a woman.\n\nAnother step with his knees knocking together.\n\nIT WAS MARGARET BRANDT.\n\n     (1) Beat down Satan under our feet.\n\n     (2) Up, hearts!\n\n     (3) O God our refuge and strength.\n\n     (4) O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world,\n     have mercy upon me!\n\n     (5) O Holy Trinity, one God, have mercy upon us.\n\n     (6) From the assaults of demons--from the wrath to come--\n     from everlasting damnation, deliver us, O Lord!\n\n     (7) See the English collect, St., Michael and all Angels.\n\n     (8) Of whom may we seek succour but of Thee, O Lord, who for\n     our sins art justly displeased (and that torrent of prayer,\n     the following verse).\n\n     (9) Dr. Dickson, author of Fallacies of the Faculty, etc.\n\n     (10) It is related of a mediaeval hermit, that being offered\n     a garment made of cats' skins, he rejected it, saying, \"I\n     have heard of a lamb of God but I never heard of a cat of\n     God.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCIV\n\nHER attitude was one to excite pity rather than terror, in eyes not\nblinded by a preconceived notion. Her bosom was fluttering like a bird,\nand the red and white coming and going in her cheeks, and she had her\nhand against the wall by the instinct of timid things, she trembled\nso; and the marvellous mixed gaze of love, and pious awe, and pity, and\ntender memories, those purple eyes cast on the emaciated and glaring\nhermit, was an event in nature.\n\n\"Aha!\" he cried. \"Thou art come at last in flesh and blood; come to me\nas thou camest to holy Anthony. But I am ware of thee. I thought thy\nwiles were not exhausted. I am armed.\" With this he snatched up his\nsmall crucifix and held it out at her, astonished, and the candle in the\nother hand, both crucifix and candle shaking violently. \"Exorcizo te.\"\n\n\"Ah, no!\" cried she piteously; and put out two pretty deprecating palms.\n\"Alas! work me no ill! It is Margaret.\"\n\n\"Liar!\" shouted the hermit. \"Margaret was fair, but not so supernatural\nfair as thou. Thou didst shrink at that sacred name, thou subtle\nhypocrite. In Nomine Dei exorcizo vos.\"\n\n\"Ah, Jesu!\" gasped Margaret, in extremity of terror, \"curse me not! I\nwill go home. I thought I might come. For very manhood be-Latin me not!\nOh, Gerard, is it thus you and I meet after all, after all?\"\n\nAnd she cowered almost to her knees and sobbed with superstitious fear\nand wounded affection.\n\nImpregnated as he was with Satanophobia he might perhaps have doubted\nstill whether this distressed creature, all woman and nature, was\nnot all art and fiend. But her spontaneous appeal to that sacred name\ndissolved his chimera; and let him see with his eyes, and hear with his\nears.\n\nHe uttered a cry of self-reproach, and tried to raise her but what with\nfasts, what with the overpowering emotion of a long solitude so broken,\nhe could not. \"What,\" he gasped, shaking over her, \"and is it thou? And\nhave I met thee with hard words? Alas!\" And they were both choked with\nemotion and could not speak for a while.\n\n\"I heed it not much,\" said Margaret bravely, struggling with her tears;\n\"you took me for another: for a devil; oh! oh! oh! oh! oh!\"\n\n\"Forgive me, sweet soul!\" And as soon as he could speak more than a word\nat a time, he said, \"I have been much beset by the evil one since I came\nhere.\"\n\nMargaret looked round with a shudder. \"Like enow. Then oh take my hand,\nand let me lead thee from this foul place.\"\n\nHe gazed at her with astonishment.\n\n\"What, desert my cell; and go into the world again? Is it for that thou\nhast come to me?\" said he sadly and reproachfully.\n\n\"Ay, Gerard, I am come to take thee to thy pretty vicarage: art vicar\nof Gouda, thanks to Heaven and thy good brother Giles; and mother and\nI have made it so neat for thee, Gerard. 'Tis well enow in winter I\npromise thee. But bide a bit till the hawthorn bloom, and anon thy\nwalls put on their kirtle of brave roses, and sweet woodbine, Have we\nforgotten thee, and the foolish things thou lovest? And, dear Gerard,\nthy mother is waiting; and 'tis late for her to be out of her bed:\nprithee, prithee, come! And the moment we are out of this foul hole I'll\nshow thee a treasure thou hast gotten, and knowest nought on't, or sure\nhadst never fled from us so. Alas! what is to do? What have I ignorantly\nsaid, to be regarded thus?\"\n\nFor he had drawn himself all up into a heap, and was looking at her with\na strange gaze of fear and suspicion blended.\n\n\"Unhappy girl,\" said he solemnly, yet deeply agitated, \"would you have\nme risk my soul and yours for a miserable vicarage and the flowers that\ngrow on it? But this is not thy doing: the bowelless fiend sends thee,\npoor simple girl, to me with this bait. But oh, cunning fiend, I will\nunmask thee even to this thine instrument, and she shall see thee, and\nabhor thee as I do, Margaret, my lost love, why am I here? Because I\nlove thee.\"\n\n\"Oh! no, Gerard, you love me not or you would not have hidden from me;\nthere was no need.\"\n\n\"Let there be no deceit between us twain, that have loved so true; and\nafter this night, shall meet no more on earth.\"\n\n\"Now God forbid!\" said she.\n\n\"I love thee, and thou hast not forgotten me, or thou hadst married ere\nthis, and hadst not been the one to find me, buried here from sight of\nman. I am a priest, a monk: what but folly or sin can come of you and\nme living neighbours, and feeding a passion innocent once, but now (so\nHeaven wills it) impious and unholy? No, though my heart break I must be\nfirm. 'Tis I that am the man, 'tis I that am the priest. You and I must\nmeet no more, till I am schooled by solitude, and thou art wedded to\nanother.\"\n\n\"I consent to my doom but not to thine. I would ten times liever die;\nyet I will marry, ay, wed misery itself sooner than let thee lie in\nthis foul dismal place, with yon sweet manse awaiting for thee.\" Clement\ngroaned; at each word she spoke out stood clearer and clearer two\nthings--his duty, and the agony it must cost.\n\n\"My beloved,\" said he, with a strange mixture of tenderness and dogged\nresolution, \"I bless thee for giving me one more sight of thy sweet\nface, and may God forgive thee, and bless thee, for destroying in a\nminute the holy peace it hath taken six months of solitude to build. No\nmatter. A year of penance will, Dei gratia, restore me to my calm. My\npoor Margaret, I seem cruel: yet I am kind: 'tis best we part; ay, this\nmoment.\"\n\n\"Part, Gerard? Never: we have seen what comes of parting. Part? Why, you\nhave not heard half my story; no, nor the tithe, 'Tis not for thy mere\ncomfort I take thee to Gouda manse. Hear me!\"\n\n\"I may not. Thy very voice is a temptation with its music, memory's\ndelight.\"\n\n\"But I say you shall hear me, Gerard, for forth this place I go not\nunheard.\"\n\n\"Then must we part by other means,\" said Clement sadly.\n\n\"Alack! what other means? Wouldst put me to thine own door, being the\nstronger?\"\n\n\"Nay, Margaret, well thou knowest I would suffer many deaths rather than\nput force on thee; thy sweet body is dearer to me than my own; but a\nmillion times dearer to me are our immortal souls, both thine and mine.\nI have withstood this direst temptation of all long enow. Now I must fly\nit: farewell! farewell!\"\n\nHe made to the door, and had actually opened it and got half out, when\nshe darted after and caught him by the arm.\n\n\"Nay, then another must speak for me. I thought to reward thee for\nyielding to me; but unkind that thou art, I need his help I find; turn\nthen this way one moment.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay.\"\n\n\"But I say ay! And then turn thy back on us an thou canst.\" She somewhat\nrelaxed her grasp, thinking he would never deny her so small a favour.\nBut at this he saw his opportunity and seized it.\n\n\"Fly, Clement, fly!\" he almost shrieked; and his religious enthusiasm\ngiving him for a moment his old strength, he burst wildly away from her,\nand after a few steps bounded over the little stream and ran beside it,\nbut finding he was not followed stopped, and looked back.\n\nShe was lying on her face, with her hands spread out.\n\nYes, without meaning it, he had thrown her down and hurt her.\n\nWhen he saw that, he groaned and turned back a step; but suddenly, by\nanother impulse flung himself into the icy water instead.\n\n\"There, kill my body!\" he cried, \"but save my soul!\"\n\nWhilst he stood there, up to his throat in liquid ice, so to speak,\nMargaret uttered one long, piteous moan, and rose to her knees.\n\nHe saw her as plain almost as in midday. Saw her pale face and her eyes\nglistening; and then in the still night he heard these words:\n\n\"Oh, God! Thou that knowest all, Thou seest how I am used. Forgive me\nthen! For I will not live another day.\" With this she suddenly started\nto her feet, and flew like some wild creature, wounded to death,\nclose by his miserable hiding-place, shrieking:\n\n\"CRUEL!--CRUEL!--CRUEL!--CRUEL!\"\n\nWhat manifold anguish may burst from a human heart in a single syllable.\nThere were wounded love, and wounded pride, and despair, and coming\nmadness all in that piteous cry. Clement heard, and it froze his heart\nwith terror and remorse, worse than the icy water chilled the marrow of\nhis bones.\n\nHe felt he had driven her from him for ever, and in the midst of\nhis dismal triumph, the greatest he had won, there came an almost\nincontrollable impulse to curse the Church, to curse religion itself,\nfor exacting such savage cruelty from mortal man. At last he crawled\nhalf dead out of the water, and staggered to his den. \"I am safe here,\"\nhe groaned; \"she will never come near me again; unmanly, ungrateful\nwretch that I am.\" And he flung his emaciated, frozen body down on the\nfloor, not without a secret hope that it might never rise thence alive.\n\nBut presently he saw by the hour-glass that it was past midnight.\n\nOn this, he rose slowly and took off his wet things, and moaning all\nthe time at the pain he had caused her he loved, put on the old hermit's\ncilice of bristles, and over that his breastplate. He had never worn\neither of these before, doubting himself worthy to don the arms of that\ntried soldier. But now he must give himself every aid; the bristles\nmight distract his earthly remorse by bodily pain, and there might be\nholy virtue in the breastplate. Then he kneeled down and prayed God\nhumbly to release him that very night from the burden of the flesh. Then\nhe lighted all his candles, and recited his psalter doggedly; each word\nseemed to come like a lump of lead from a leaden heart, and to fall\nleaden to the ground; and in this mechanical office every now and then\nhe moaned with all his soul. In the midst of which he suddenly observed\na little bundle in the corner he had not seen before in the feebler\nlight, and at one end of it something like gold spun into silk.\n\nHe went to see what it could be; and he had no sooner viewed it closer,\nthan he threw up his hands with rapture. \"It is a seraph,\" he whispered,\n\"a lovely seraph. Heaven hath witnessed my bitter trial, and approves\nmy cruelty; and this flower of the skies is sent to cheer me, fainting\nunder my burden.\"\n\nHe fell on his knees, and gazed with ecstasy on its golden hair, and its\ntender skin, and cheeks like a peach.\n\n\"Let me feast my sad eyes on thee ere thou leavest me for thine\never-blessed abode, and my cell darkens again at thy parting, as it did\nat hers.\"\n\nWith all this, the hermit disturbed the lovely visitor. He opened wide\ntwo eyes, the colour of heaven; and seeing a strange figure kneeling\nover him, he cried piteously, \"MUMMA! MUM-MA!\" And the tears began to\nrun down his little cheeks.\n\nPerhaps, after all, Clement, who for more than six months had not looked\non the human face divine, estimated childish beauty more justly than we\ncan; and in truth, this fair northern child, with its long golden hair,\nwas far more angelic than any of our imagined angels. But now the spell\nwas broken.\n\nYet not unhappily. Clement it may be remembered, was fond of children,\nand true monastic life fosters this sentiment. The innocent distress on\nthe cherubic face, the tears that ran so smoothly from those transparent\nviolets, his eyes, and his pretty, dismal cry for his only friend, his\nmother, went through the hermit's heart. He employed all his gentleness\nand all his art to soothe him; and as the little soul was wonderfully\nintelligent for his age, presently succeeded so far that he ceased to\ncry out, and wonder took the place of fear; while, in silence, broken\nonly in little gulps, he scanned, with great tearful eyes, this strange\nfigure that looked so wild, but spoke so kindly, and wore armour, yet\ndid not kill little boys, but coaxed them. Clement was equally perplexed\nto know how this little human flower came to lie sparkling and blooming\nin his gloomy cave. But he remembered he had left the door wide open,\nand he was driven to conclude that, owing to this negligence, some\nunfortunate creature of high or low degree had seized this opportunity\nto get rid of her child for ever.(1). At this his bowels yearned so over\nthe poor deserted cherub, that the tears of pure tenderness stood in\nhis eyes, and still, beneath the crime of the mother, he saw the divine\ngoodness, which had so directed her heartlessness as to comfort His\nservant's breaking heart.\n\n\"Now bless thee, bless thee, bless thee, sweet innocent, I would not\nchange thee for e'en a cherub in heaven.\"\n\n\"At's pooty,\" replied the infant, ignoring contemptuously, after the\nmanner of infants, all remarks that did not interest him.\n\n\"What is pretty here, my love, besides thee?\"\n\n\"Ookum-gars,(2) said the boy, pointing to the hermit's breastplate.\n\n\"Quot liberi, tot sententiunculae!\" Hector's child screamed at his\nfather's glittering casque and nodding crest; and here was a mediaeval\nbabe charmed with a polished cuirass, and his griefs assuaged.\n\n\"There are prettier things here than that,\" said Clement, \"there are\nlittle birds; lovest thou birds?\"\n\n\"Nay. Ay. En um ittle, ery ittle? Not ike torks. Hate torks um bigger an\nbaby.\"\n\nHe then confided, in very broken language, that the storks with their\ngreat flapping wings scared him, and were a great trouble and worry to\nhim, darkening his existence more or less.\n\n\"Ay, but my birds are very little, and good, and oh, so pretty!\"\n\n\"Den I ikes 'm,\" said the child authoritatively, \"I ont my mammy.\"\n\n\"Alas, sweet dove! I doubt I shall have to fill her place as best I may.\nHast thou no daddy as well as mammy, sweet one?\"\n\nNow not only was this conversation from first to last, the relative\nages, situations, and all circumstances of the parties considered, as\nstrange a one as ever took place between two mortal creatures, but at\nor within a second or two of the hermit's last question, to turn the\nstrange into the marvellous, came an unseen witness, to whom every\nword that passed carried ten times the force it did to either of the\nspeakers.\n\nSince, therefore, it is with her eyes you must now see, and hear with\nher ears, I go back a step for her.\n\nMargaret, when she ran past Gerard, was almost mad. She was in that\nstate of mind in which affectionate mothers have been known to kill\ntheir children, sometimes along with themselves, sometimes alone, which\nlast is certainly maniacal, She ran to Reicht Heynes pale and trembling,\nand clasped her round the neck, \"Oh, Reicht! oh, Reicht!\" and could say\nno more.\n\nReicht kissed her, and began to whimper; and would you believe it, the\ngreat mastiff uttered one long whine: even his glimmer of sense taught\nhim grief was afoot.\n\n\"Oh, Reicht!\" moaned the despised beauty, as soon as she could utter a\nword for choking, \"see how he has served me!\" and she showed her hands,\nthat were bleeding with falling on the stony ground. \"He threw me down,\nhe was so eager to fly from me, He took me for a devil; he said I came\nto tempt him. Am I the woman to tempt a man? you know me, Reicht.\"\n\n\"Nay, in sooth, sweet Mistress Margaret, the last i' the world.\"\n\n\"And he would not look at my child. I'll fling myself and him into the\nRotter this night.\"\n\n\"Oh, fie! fie! eh, my sweet woman, speak not so. Is any man that\nbreathes worth your child's life?\"\n\n\"My child! where is he? Why, Reicht, I have left him behind. Oh, shame!\nis it possible I can love him to that degree as to forget my child? Ah!\nI am rightly served for it.\"\n\nAnd she sat down, and faithful Reicht beside her, and they sobbed in one\nanother's arms.\n\nAfter a while Margaret left off sobbing and said doggedly, \"let us go\nhome.\"\n\n\"Ay, but the bairn?\"\n\n\"Oh! he is well where he is. My heart is turned against my very child,\nHe cares nought for him; wouldn't see him, nor hear speak of him; and I\ntook him there so proud, and made his hair so nice, I did, and put his\nnew frock and cowl on him. Nay, turn about: it's his child as well as\nmine; let him keep it awhile: mayhap that will learn him to think more\nof its mother and his own.\"\n\n\"High words off an empty stomach,\" said Reicht.\n\n\"Time will show. Come you home.\"\n\nThey departed, and Time did show quicker than he levels abbeys, for at\nthe second step Margaret stopped, and could neither go one way nor the\nother, but stood stock still.\n\n\"Reicht,\" said she piteously, \"what else have I on earth? I cannot.\"\n\n\"Whoever said you could? Think you I paid attention? Words are woman's\nbreath. Come back for him without more ado; 'tis time we were in our\nbeds, much more he.\"\n\nReicht led the way, and Margaret followed readily enough in that\ndirection; but as they drew near the cell, she stopped again.\n\n\"Reicht, go you and ask him, will he give me back my boy; for I could\nnot bear the sight of him.\"\n\n\"Alas! mistress, this do seem a sorry ending after all that hath been\nbetwixt you twain. Bethink thee now, doth thine heart whisper no excuse\nfor him? dost verily hate him for whom thou hast waited so long? Oh,\nweary world!\"\n\n\"Hate him, Reicht? I would not harm a hair of his head for all that is\nin nature; but look on him I cannot; I have taken a horror of him. Oh!\nwhen I think of all I have suffered for him, and what I came here this\nnight to do for him, and brought my own darling to kiss him and call\nhim father. Ah, Luke, my poor chap, my wound showeth me thine. I have\nthought too little of thy pangs, whose true affection I despised; and\nnow my own is despised, Reicht, if the poor lad was here now, he would\nhave a good chance.\"\n\n\"Well, he is not far off,\" said Reicht Heynes; but somehow she did not\nsay it with alacrity.\n\n\"Speak not to me of any man,\" said Margaret bitterly; \"I hate them all.\"\n\n\"For the sake of one?\"\n\n\"Flout me not, but prithee go forward, and get me what is my own, my\nsole joy in the world. Thou knowest I am on thorns till I have him to my\nbosom again.\"\n\nReicht went forward; Margaret sat by the roadside and covered her face\nwith her apron, and rocked herself after the manner of her country, for\nher soul was full of bitterness and grief. So severe, indeed, was the\ninternal conflict, that she did not hear Reicht running back to her, and\nstarted violently when the young woman laid a hand upon her shoulder.\n\n\"Mistress Margaret!\" said Reicht quietly, \"take a fool's advice that\nloves ye. Go softly to yon cave, wi' all the ears and eyes your mother\never gave you.\"\n\n\"Why? Reicht?\" stammered Margaret.\n\n\"I thought the cave was afire, 'twas so light inside; and there were\nvoices.\"\n\n\"Voices?\"\n\n\"Ay, not one, but twain, and all unlike--a man's and a little child's\ntalking as pleasant as you and me. I am no great hand at a keyhole for\nmy part, 'tis paltry work; but if so be voices were a talking in yon\ncave, and them that owned those voices were so near to me as those are\nto thee, I'd go on all fours like a fox, and I'd crawl on my belly like\na serpent, ere I'd lose one word that passes atwixt those twain.\"\n\n\"Whisht, Reicht! Bless thee! Bide thou here. Buss me! Pray for me!\"\n\nAnd almost ere the agitated words had left her lips, Margaret was flying\ntowards the hermitage as noiselessly as a lapwing.\n\nArrived near it, she crouched, and there was something truly serpentine\nin the gliding, flexible, noiseless movements by which she reached the\nvery door, and there she found a chink, and listened. And often it cost\nher a struggle not to burst in upon them; but warned by defeat, she was\ncautious, and resolute, let well alone, And after a while, slowly and\nnoiselessly she reared her head, like a snake its crest, to where she\nsaw the broadest chink of all, and looked with all her eyes and soul, as\nwell as listened.\n\nThe little boy then being asked whether he had no daddy, at first shook\nhis head, and would say nothing; but being pressed he suddenly seemed to\nremember something, and said he, \"Dad-da ill man; run away and left poor\nmum-ma.\"\n\nShe who heard this winced. It was as new to her as to Clement. Some\ninterfering foolish woman had gone and said this to the boy, and now out\nit came in Gerard's very face. His answer surprised her; he burst out,\n\"The villain! the monster! he must be born without bowels to desert\nthee, sweet one, Ah! he little knows the joy he has turned his back on.\nWell, my little dove, I must be father and mother to thee, since the one\nruns away, and t'other abandons thee to my care. Now to-morrow I shall\nask the good people that bring me my food to fetch some nice eggs\nand milk for thee as well; for bread is good enough for poor old\ngood-for-nothing me, but not for thee. And I shall teach thee to read.\"\n\n\"I can yead, I can yead.\"\n\n\"Ay, verily, so young? all the better; we will read good books together,\nand I shall show thee the way to heaven. Heaven is a beautiful place, a\nthousand times fairer and better than earth, and there be little cherubs\nlike thyself, in white, glad to welcome thee and love thee. Wouldst like\nto go to heaven one day?\"\n\n\"Ay, along wi'-my-mammy.\"\n\n\"What, not without her then?\"\n\n\"Nay. I ont my mammy. Where is my mammy?\"\n\n(Oh! what it cost poor Margaret not to burst in and clasp him to her\nheart!)\n\n\"Well, fret not, sweetheart, mayhap she will come when thou art asleep.\nWilt thou be good now and sleep?\"\n\n\"I not eepy. Ikes to talk.\"\n\n\"Well, talk we then; tell me thy pretty name.\"\n\n\"Baby.\" And he opened his eyes with amazement at this great hulking\ncreature's ignorance.\n\n\"Hast none other?\"\n\n\"Nay.\"\n\n\"What shall I do to pleasure thee, baby? Shall I tell thee a story?\"\n\n\"I ikes tories,\" said the boy, clapping his hands.\n\n\"Or sing thee a song?\"\n\n\"I ikes tongs,\" and he became excited.\n\n\"Choose then, a song or a story.\"\n\n\"Ting I a tong. Nay, tell I a tory. Nay, ting I a tong. Nay--And the\ncorners of his little mouth turned down and he had half a mind to weep\nbecause he could not have both, and could not tell which to forego.\nSuddenly his little face cleared: \"Ting I a tory,\" said he.\n\n\"Sing thee a story, baby? Well, after all, why not? And wilt thou sit o'\nmy knee and hear it?\"\n\n\"Yea.\"\n\n\"Then I must e'en doff this breastplate, 'Tis too hard for thy soft\ncheek. So. And now I must doff this bristly cilice; they would prick thy\ntender skin, perhaps make it bleed, as they have me, I see. So. And now\nI put on my best pelisse, in honour of thy worshipful visit. See how\nsoft and warm it is; bless the good soul that sent it; and now I sit\nme down; so. And I take thee on my left knee, and put my arm under thy\nlittle head; so, And then the psaltery, and play a little tune; so, not\ntoo loud.\"\n\n\"I ikes dat.\"\n\n\"I am right glad on't. Now list the story.\"\n\nHe chanted a child's story in a sort of recitative, singing a little\nmoral refrain now and then. The boy listened with rapture.\n\n\"I ikes oo,\" said he, \"Ot is oo? is oo a man?\"\n\n\"Ay, little heart, and a great sinner to boot.\"\n\n\"I ikes great tingers. Ting one other tory.\"\n\nStory No. 2 was Chanted.\n\n\"I ubbs oo,\" cried the child impetuously, \"Ot caft(3) is oo?\"\n\n\"I am a hermit, love.\"\n\n\"I ubbs vermins. Ting other one.\"\n\nBut during this final performance, Nature suddenly held out her leaden\nsceptre over the youthful eyelids. \"I is not eepy,\" whined he very\nfaintly, and succumbed.\n\nClement laid down his psaltery softly and began to rock his new treasure\nin his arms, and to crone over him a little lullaby well known in\nTergou, with which his own mother had often sent him off.\n\nAnd the child sank into a profound sleep upon his arm. And he stopped\ncroning and gazed on him with infinite tenderness, yet sadness; for at\nthat moment he could not help thinking what might have been but for a\npiece of paper with a lie in it.\n\nHe sighed deeply.\n\nThe next moment the moonlight burst into his cell, and with it, and in\nit, and almost as swift as it, Margaret Brandt was down at his knee with\na timorous hand upon his shoulder.\n\n\"GERARD, YOU DO NOT REJECT US, YOU CANNOT.\"\n\n     (1) More than one hermit had received a present of this\n     kind.\n\n     (2) Query, \"looking glass.\"\n\n     (3) Craft. He means trade or profession.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCV\n\nThe startled hermit glared from his nurseling to Margaret, and from\nher to him, in amazement, equalled only by his agitation at her so\nunexpected return. The child lay asleep on his left arm, and she was\nat his right knee; no longer the pale, scared, panting girl he had\noverpowered so easily an hour or two ago, but an imperial beauty, with\nblushing cheeks and sparkling eyes, and lips sweetly parted in triumph,\nand her whole face radiant with a look he could not quite read; for he\nhad never yet seen it on her: maternal pride.\n\nHe stared and stared from the child to her, in throbbing amazement.\n\n\"Us?\" he gasped at last. And still his wonder-stricken eyes turned to\nand fro.\n\nMargaret was surprised in her turn, It was an age of impressions not\nfacts, \"What!\" she cried, \"doth not a father know his own child? and a\nman of God, too? Fie, Gerard, to pretend! nay, thou art too wise, too\ngood, not to have--why, I watched thee; and e'en now look at you twain!\n'Tis thine own flesh and blood thou holdest to thine heart.\"\n\nClement trembled, \"What words are these,\" he stammered, \"this angel\nmine?\"\n\n\"Whose else? since he is mine.\"\n\nClement turned on the sleeping child, with a look beyond the power of\nthe pen to describe, and trembled all over, as his eyes seemed to absorb\nthe little love.\n\nMargaret's eyes followed his. \"He is not a bit like me,\" said she\nproudly; \"but oh, at whiles he is thy very image in little; and see this\ngolden hair. Thine was the very colour at his age; ask mother else. And\nsee this mole on his little finger; now look at thine own; there! 'Twas\nthy mother let me weet thou wast marked so before him; and oh, Gerard,\n'twas this our child found thee for me; for by that little mark on thy\nfinger I knew thee for his father, when I watched above thy window and\nsaw thee feed the birds.\" Here she seized the child's hand, and kissed\nit eagerly, and got half of it into her mouth, Heaven knows how, \"Ah!\nbless thee, thou didst find thy poor daddy for her, and now thou hast\nmade us friends again after our little quarrel; the first, the last.\nWast very cruel to me but now, my poor Gerard, and I forgive thee; for\nloving of thy child.\"\n\n\"Ah! ah! ah! ah! ah!\" sobbed Clement, choking. And lowered by fasts,\nand unnerved by solitude, the once strong man was hysterical, and nearly\nfainting.\n\nMargaret was alarmed, but having experience, her pity was greater than\nher fear. \"Nay, take not on so,\" she murmured soothingly, and put a\ngentle hand upon his brow. \"Be brave! So, so. Dear heart, thou art not\nthe first man that hath gone abroad and come back richer by a lovely\nlittle self than he went forth. Being a man of God, take courage, and\nsay He sends thee this to comfort thee for what thou hast lost in me;\nand that is not so very much, my lamb; for sure the better part of love\nshall ne'er cool here to thee; though it may in thine, and ought, being\na priest, and parson of Gouda.\"\n\n\"I? priest of Gouda? Never!\" murmured Clement in a faint voice; \"I am\na friar of St. Dominic: yet speak on, sweet music, tell me all that has\nhappened thee, before we are parted again.\"\n\nNow some would on this have exclaimed against parting at all, and raised\nthe true question in dispute. But such women as Margaret do not repeat\ntheir mistakes. It is very hard to defeat them twice, where their hearts\nare set on a thing.\n\nShe assented, and turned her back on Gouda manse as a thing not to\nbe recurred to; and she told him her tale, dwelling above all on the\nkindness to her of his parents; and while she related her troubles, his\nhand stole to hers, and often she felt him wince and tremble with ire,\nand often press her hand, sympathizing with her in every vein.\n\n\"Oh, piteous tale of a true heart battling alone against such bitter\nodds,\" said he.\n\n\"It all seems small, when I see thee here again, and nursing my boy. We\nhave had a warning, Gerard. True friends like you and me are rare, and\nthey are mad to part, ere death divideth them.\"\n\n\"And that is true,\" said Clement, off his guard.\n\nAnd then she would have him tell her what he had suffered for her, and\nhe begged her to excuse him, and she consented; but by questions quietly\nrevoked her consent and elicited it all; and many a sigh she heaved for\nhim, and more than once she hid her face in her hands with terror at his\nperils, though past. And to console him for all he had gone through,\nshe kneeled down and put her arms under the little boy, and lifted him\ngently up. \"Kiss him softly,\" she whispered. \"Again, again kiss thy fill\nif thou canst; he is sound. 'Tis all I can do to comfort thee till thou\nart out of this foul den and in thy sweet manse yonder.\"\n\nClement shook his head.\n\n\"Well,\" said she, \"let that pass. Know that I have been sore affronted\nfor want of my lines.\"\n\n\"Who hath dared affront thee?\"\n\n\"No matter, those that will do it again if thou hast lost them, which\nthe saints forbid.\"\n\n\"I lose them? nay, there they lie, close to thy hand.\"\n\n\"Where, where, oh, where?\"\n\nClement hung his head. \"Look in the Vulgate. Heaven forgive me: I\nthought thou wert dead, and a saint in heaven.\"\n\nShe looked, and on the blank leaves of the poor soul's Vulgate she found\nher marriage lines.\n\n\"Thank God!\" she cried, \"thank God! Oh, bless thee, Gerard, bless thee!\nWhy, what is here, Gerard?\"\n\nOn the other leaves were pinned every scrap of paper she had ever sent\nhim, and their two names she had once written together in sport, and\nthe lock of her hair she had given him, and half a silver coin she had\nbroken with him, and a straw she had sucked her soup with the first day\nhe ever saw her.\n\nWhen Margaret saw these proofs of love and signs of a gentle heart\nbereaved, even her exultation at getting back her marriage lines was\noverpowered by gushing tenderness. She almost staggered, and her hand\nwent to her bosom, and she leaned her brow against the stone cell and\nwept so silently that he did not see she was weeping; indeed she would\nnot let him, for she felt that to befriend him now she must be the\nstronger; and emotion weakens.\n\n\"Gerard,\" said she, \"I know you are wise and good. You must have a\nreason for what you are doing, let it seem ever so unreasonable. Talk we\nlike old friends. Why are you buried alive?\"\n\n\"Margaret, to escape temptation. My impious ire against those two had\nits root in the heart; that heart then I must deaden, and, Dei gratia, I\nshall. Shall I, a servant of Christ and of the Church, court temptation?\nShall I pray daily to be led out on't, and walk into it with open eyes?\"\n\n\"That is good sense anyway,\" said Margaret, with a consummate\naffectation of candour.\n\n\"'Tis unanswerable,\" said Clement, with a sigh.\n\n\"We shall see. Tell me, have you escaped temptation here? Why I ask\nis, when I am alone, my thoughts are far more wild and foolish than in\ncompany. Nay, speak sooth; come!\"\n\n\"I must needs own I have been worse tempted here with evil imaginations\nthan in the world.\"\n\n\"There now.\"\n\n\"Ay, but so were Anthony and Jerome, Macarius and Hilarion, Benedict,\nBernard, and all the saints. 'Twill wear off.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\"\n\n\"I feel sure it will.\"\n\n\"Guessing against knowledge. Here 'tis men folk are sillier than us that\nbe but women. Wise in their own conceits, they will not let themselves\nsee; their stomachs are too high to be taught by their eyes. A woman, if\nshe went into a hole in a bank to escape temptation, and there found it,\nwould just lift her farthingale and out on't, and not e'en know how wise\nshe was, till she watched a man in like plight.\"\n\n\"Nay, I grant humility and a teachable spirit are the roads to wisdom;\nbut when all is said, here I wrestle but with imagination. At Gouda she\nI love as no priest or monk must love any but the angels, she will tempt\na weak soul, unwilling, yet not loth to be tempted.\"\n\n\"Ay, that is another matter; I should tempt thee then? to what, i' God's\nname?\"\n\n\"Who knows? The flesh is weak.\"\n\n\"Speak for yourself, my lad. Why, you are thinking of some other\nMargaret, not Margaret a Peter. Was ever my mind turned to folly and\nfrailty? Stay, is it because you were my husband once, as these lines\navouch? Think you the road to folly is beaten for you more than another?\nOh! how shallow are the wise, and how little able are you to read me,\nwho can read you so well from top to toe, Come, learn thine A B C. Were\na stranger to proffer me unchaste love, I should shrink a bit, no doubt,\nand feel sore, but I should defend myself without making a coil; for\nmen, I know, are so, the best of them sometimes. But if you, that have\nbeen my husband, and are my child's father, were to offer to humble me\nso in mine own eyes, and thine, and his, either I should spit in thy\nface, Gerard, or, as I am not a downright vulgar woman, I should snatch\nthe first weapon at hand and strike thee dead.\"\n\nAnd Margaret's eyes flashed fire, and her nostrils expanded, that it was\nglorious to see; and no one that did see her could doubt her sincerity.\n\n\"I had not the sense to see that,\" said Gerard quietly. And he pondered.\n\nMargaret eyed him in silence, and soon recovered her composure.\n\n\"Let not you and I dispute,\" said she gently; \"speak we of other things.\nAsk me of thy folk.\"\n\n\"My father?\"\n\n\"Well, and warms to thee and me. Poor soul, a drew glaive on those twain\nthat day, but Jorian Ketel and I we mastered him, and he drove them\nforth his house for ever.\"\n\n\"That may not be; he must take them back.\"\n\n\"That he will never do for us. You know the man; he is dour as iron; yet\nwould he do it for one word from one that will not speak it.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"The vicar of Gouda, The old man will be at the manse to-morrow, I\nhear.\"\n\n\"How you come back to that.\"\n\n\"Forgive me: I am but a woman. It is us for nagging; shouldst keep me\nfrom it wi' questioning of me.\"\n\n\"My sister Kate?\"\n\n\"Alas!\"\n\n\"What, hath ill befallen e'en that sweet lily? Out and alas!\"\n\n\"Be calm, sweetheart, no harm hath her befallen. Oh, nay, nay, far fro'\nthat.\" Then Margaret forced herself to be composed, and in a low, sweet,\ngentle voice she murmured to him thus:\n\n\"My poor Gerard, Kate hath left her trouble behind her. For the manner\non't, 'twas like the rest. Ah, such as she saw never thirty, nor ever\nshall while earth shall last. She smiled in pain too. A well, then, thus\n'twas: she was took wi' a languor and a loss of all her pains.\"\n\n\"A loss of her pains? I understand you not.\"\n\n\"Ay, you are not experienced; indeed, e'en thy mother almost blinded\nherself and said, ''Tis maybe a change for the better.' But Joan Ketel,\nwhich is an understanding woman, she looked at her and said, 'Down sun,\ndown wind!' And the gossips sided and said, 'Be brave, you that are her\nmother, for she is half way to the saints.' And thy mother wept sore,\nbut Kate would not let her; and one very ancient woman, she said to thy\nmother, 'She will die as easy as she lived hard.' And she lay painless\nbest part of three days, a sipping of heaven afore-hand, And, my dear,\nwhen she was just parting, she asked for 'Gerard's little boy,' and\nI brought him and set him on the bed, and the little thing behaved as\npeaceably as he does now. But by this time she was past speaking; but\nshe pointed to a drawer, and her mother knew what to look for: it was\ntwo gold angels thou hadst given her years ago. Poor soul! she had kept\nthen, till thou shouldst come home. And she nodded towards the little\nboy, and looked anxious; but we understood her, and put the pieces in\nhis two hands, and when his little fingers closed on them, she smiled\ncontent. And so she gave her little earthly treasures to her favourite's\nchild--for you were her favourite--and her immortal jewel to God,\nand passed so sweetly we none of us knew justly when she left us.\nWell-a-day, well-a-day!\"\n\nGerard wept.\n\n\"She hath not left her like on earth,\" he sobbed. \"Oh, how the\naffections of earth curl softly round my heart! I cannot help it; God\nmade them after all. Speak on, sweet Margaret at thy voice the past\nrolls its tides back upon me; the loves and the hopes of youth come fair\nand gliding into my dark cell, and darker bosom, on waves of memory and\nmusic.\"\n\n\"Gerard, I am loth to grieve you, but Kate cried a little when she first\ntook ill at you not being there to close her eyes.\"\n\nGerard sighed.\n\n\"You were within a league, but hid your face from her.\"\n\nHe groaned.\n\n\"There, forgive me for nagging; I am but a woman; you would not have\nbeen so cruel to your own flesh and blood knowingly, would you?\"\n\n\"Oh, no.\"\n\n\"Well, then, know that thy brother Sybrandt lies in my charge with a\nbroken back, fruit of thy curse.\"\n\n\"Mea culpa! mea culpa!\"\n\n\"He is very penitent; be yourself and forgive him this night.\"\n\n\"I have forgiven him long ago.\"\n\n\"Think you he can believe that from any mouth but yours? Come! he is but\nabout two butts' length hence.\"\n\n\"So near? Why, where?\"\n\n\"At Gouda manse. I took him there yestreen. For I know you, the curse\nwas scarce cold on your lips when you repented it\" (Gerard nodded\nassent), \"and I said to myself, Gerard will thank me for taking Sybrandt\nto die under his roof; he will not beat his breast and cry mea culpa,\nyet grudge three footsteps to quiet a withered brother on his last bed.\nHe may have a bee in his bonnet, but he is not a hypocrite, a thing all\npious words and uncharitable deeds.\"\n\nGerard literally staggered where he sat at this tremendous thrust.\n\n\"Forgive me for nagging,\" said she. \"Thy mother too is waiting for thee.\nIs it well done to keep her on thorns so long She will not sleep this\nnight, Bethink thee, Gerard, she is all to thee that I am to this sweet\nchild. Ah, I think so much more of mothers since I had my little Gerard.\nShe suffered for thee, and nursed thee, and tended thee from boy to man.\nPriest monk, hermit, call thyself what thou wilt, to her thou art but\none thing; her child.\"\n\n\"Where is she?\" murmured Gerard, in a quavering voice.\n\n\"At Gouda manse, wearing the night in prayer and care.\"\n\nThen Margaret saw the time was come for that appeal to his reason she\nhad purposely reserved till persuasion should have paved the way for\nconviction. So the smith first softens the iron by fire, and then brings\ndown the sledge hammer.\n\nShe showed him, but in her own good straightforward Dutch, that his\npresent life was only a higher kind of selfishness, spiritual egotism;\nwhereas a priest had no more right to care only for his own soul than\nonly for his own body. That was not his path to heaven. \"But,\" said she,\n\"whoever yet lost his soul by saving the souls of others! the Almighty\nloves him who thinks of others; and when He shall see thee caring for\nthe souls of the folk the duke hath put into thine hand, He will care\nten times more for thy soul than He does now.\"\n\nGerard was struck by this remark. \"Art shrewd in dispute,\" said he.\n\n\"Far from it,\" was the reply, \"only my eyes are not bandaged with\nconceit.(1) So long as Satan walks the whole earth, tempting men, and\nso long as the sons of Belial do never lock themselves in caves, but run\nlike ants to and fro corrupting others, the good man that skulks apart\nplays the devil's game, or at least gives him the odds: thou a soldier\nof Christ? ask thy Comrade Denys, who is but a soldier of the duke, ask\nhim if ever he skulked in a hole and shunned the battle because forsooth\nin battle is danger as well as glory and duty. For thy sole excuse is\nfear; thou makest no secret on't, Go to, no duke nor king hath such\ncowardly soldiers as Christ hath. What was that you said in the church\nat Rotterdam about the man in the parable that buried his talent in the\nearth, and so offended the giver? Thy wonderful gift for preaching, is\nit not a talent, and a gift from thy Creator?\"\n\n\"Certes; such as it is.\"\n\n\"And hast thou laid it out? or buried it? To whom hast thou preached\nthese seven months? to bats and owls? Hast buried it in one hole with\nthyself and thy once good wits?\n\n\"The Dominicans are the friars preachers. 'Tis for preaching they were\nfounded, so thou art false to Dominic as well as to his Master.\n\n\"Do you remember, Gerard, when we were young together, which now are old\nbefore our time, as we walked handed in the fields, did you but see a\nsheep cast, ay, three fields off, you would leave your sweetheart (by\nher good will) and run and lift the sheep for charity? Well, then, at\nGouda is not one sheep in evil plight, but a whole flock; some cast,\nsome strayed, some sick, some tainted, some a being devoured, and all\nfor the want of a shepherd. Where is their shepherd? lurking in a den\nlike a wolf, a den in his own parish; out fie! out fie!\n\n\"I scented thee out, in part, by thy kindness to the little birds. Take\nnote, you Gerard Eliassoen must love something, 'tis in your blood; you\nwere born to't. Shunning man, you do but seek earthly affection a peg\nlower than man.\"\n\nGerard interrupted her. \"The birds are God's creatures, His innocent\ncreatures, and I do well to love them, being God's creatures.\"\n\n\"What, are they creatures of the same God that we are, that he is who\nlies upon thy knee?\"\n\n\"You know they are.\"\n\n\"Then what pretence for shunning us and being kind to them? Sith man\nis one of the animals, why pick him out to shun? Is't because he is of\nanimals the paragon? What, you court the young of birds, and abandon\nyour own young? Birds need but bodily food, and having wings, deserve\nscant pity if they cannot fly and find it. But that sweet dove upon thy\nknee, he needeth not carnal only, but spiritual food. He is thine as\nwell as mine; and I have done my share. He will soon be too much for me,\nand I look to Gouda's parson to teach him true piety and useful lore. Is\nhe not of more value than many sparrows?\"\n\nGerard started and stammered an affirmation. For she waited for his\nreply.\n\n\"You wonder,\" continued she, \"to hear me quote holy writ so glib. I have\npored over it this four years, and why? Not because God wrote it, but\nbecause I saw it often in thy hands ere thou didst leave me. Heaven\nforgive me, I am but a woman. What thinkest thou of this sentence? 'Let\nyour work so shine before men that they may see your good works and\nglorify your Father which is in heaven!' What is a saint in a sink\nbetter than 'a light under a bushel!'\n\n\"Therefore, since the sheep committed to thy charge bleat for thee and\ncry, 'Oh desert us no longer, but come to Gouda manse;' since I, who\nknow thee ten times better than thou knowest thyself, do pledge my soul\nit is for thy soul's weal to go to Gouda manse--since duty to thy child,\ntoo long abandoned, calls thee to Gouda manse--since thy sovereign, whom\nholy writ again bids thee honour, sends thee to Gouda manse--since the\nPope, whom the Church teaches thee to revere hath absolved thee of thy\nmonkish vows, and orders thee to Gouda manse--\"\n\n\"Ah!\"\n\n\"Since thy grey-haired mother watches for thee in dole and care, and\nturneth oft the hour-glass and sigheth sore that thou comest so slow to\nher at Gouda manse--since thy brother, withered by thy curse, awaits thy\nforgiveness and thy prayers for his soul, now lingering in his body, at\nGouda manse--take thou in thine arms the sweet bird wi' crest of gold\nthat nestles to thy bosom, and give me thy hand; thy sweetheart erst and\nwife, and now thy friend, the truest friend to thee this night that ere\nman had, and come with me to Gouda manse!\"\n\n\"IT IS THE VOICE OF AN ANGEL!\" cried Clement loudly.\n\n\"Then hearken it, and come forth to Gouda manse!\"\n\nThe battle was won.\n\nMargaret lingered behind, cast her eye rapidly round the furniture, and\nselected the Vulgate and the psaltery. The rest she sighed at, and let\nit lie. The breastplate and the cilice of bristles she took and dashed\nwith feeble ferocity on the floor.\n\nThen seeing Gerard watch her with surprise from the outside,\nshe coloured and said, \"I am but a woman: 'little' will still be\n'spiteful.'\"\n\n\"Why encumber thyself with those? They are safe.\"\n\n\"Oh, she had a reason.\"\n\nAnd with this they took the road to Gouda parsonage, The moon and stars\nwere so bright, it seemed almost as light as day.\n\nSuddenly Gerard stopped. \"My poor little birds!\"\n\n\"What of them?\"\n\n\"They will miss their food. I feed them every day.\"\n\n\"The child hath a piece of bread in his cowl, Take that, and feed them\nnow against the morn.\"\n\n\"I will. Nay, I will not, He is as innocent, and nearer to me and to\nthee.\"\n\nMargaret drew a long breath, \"'Tis well, Hadst taken it, I might have\nhated thee; I am but a woman.\"\n\nWhen they had gone about a quarter of a mile, Gerard sighed.\n\n\"Margaret,\" said he, \"I must e'en rest; he is too heavy for me.\"\n\n\"Then give him me, and take thou these. Alas! alas! I mind when thou\nwouldst have run with the child on one shoulder, and the mother on\nt'other.\"\n\nAnd Margaret carried the boy.\n\n\"I trow,\" said Gerard, looking down, \"overmuch fasting is not good for a\nman.\"\n\n\"A many die of it each year, winter time,\" replied Margaret.\n\nGerard pondered these simple words, and eyed her askant, carrying the\nchild with perfect ease. When they had gone nearly a mile he said with\nconsiderable surprise, \"You thought it was but two butts' length.\"\n\n\"Not I.\"\n\n\"Why, you said so.\"\n\n\"That is another matter.\" She then turned on him the face of a Madonna.\n\"I lied,\" said she sweetly. \"And to save your soul and body, I'd maybe\ntell a worse lie than that, at need. I am but a woman, Ah, well, it is\nbut two butts' length from here at any rate.\"\n\n\"Without a lie?\"\n\n\"Humph! Three, without a lie.\"\n\nAnd sure enough, in a few minutes they came up to the manse.\n\nA candle was burning in the vicar's parlour. \"She is waking still,\"\nwhispered Margaret.\n\n\"Beautiful! beautiful!\" said Clement, and stopped to look at it.\n\n\"What, in Heaven's name?\"\n\n\"That little candle, seen through the window at night. Look an it be\nnot like some fair star of size prodigious: it delighteth the eyes, and\nwarmeth the heart of those outside.\"\n\n\"Come, and I'll show thee something better,\" said Margaret, and led him\non tiptoe to the window.\n\nThey looked in, and there was Catherine kneeling on the hassock, with\nher \"hours\" before her.\n\n\"Folk can pray out of a cave,\" whispered Margaret. \"Ay and hit heaven\nwith their prayers; for 'tis for a sight of thee she prayeth, and thou\nart here. Now, Gerard, be prepared; she is not the woman you knew her;\nher children's troubles have greatly broken the brisk, light-hearted\nsoul. And I see she has been weeping e'en now; she will have given thee\nup, being so late.\"\n\n\"Let me get to her,\" said Clement hastily, trembling all over.\n\n\"That door! I will bide here.\"\n\nWhen Gerard was gone to the door, Margaret, fearing the sudden surprise,\ngave one sharp tap at the window and cried, \"Mother!\" in a loud,\nexpressive voice that Catherine read at once. She clasped her hands\ntogether and had half risen from her kneeling posture when the door\nburst open and Clement flung himself wildly on his knees at her knees,\nwith his arms out to embrace her. She uttered a cry such as only a\nmother could, \"Ah! my darling, my darling!\" and clung sobbing round his\nneck. And true it was, she saw neither a hermit, a priest, nor a monk,\nbut just her child, lost, and despaired of, and in her arms, And after a\nlittle while Margaret came in, with wet eyes and cheeks, and a holy calm\nof affection settled by degrees on these sore troubled ones. And\nthey sat all three together, hand in hand, murmuring sweet and loving\nconverse; and he who sat in the middle drank right and left their true\naffection and their humble but genuine wisdom, and was forced to eat a\ngood nourishing meal, and at daybreak was packed off to a snowy bed,\nand by and by awoke, as from a hideous dream, friar and hermit no more,\nClement no more, but Gerard Eliassoen, parson of Gouda.\n\n     (1) I think she means prejudice.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCVI\n\nMargaret went back to Rotterdam long ere Gerard awoke, and actually left\nher boy behind her. She sent the faithful, sturdy Reicht off to Gouda\ndirectly with a vicar's grey frock and large felt hat, and with minute\ninstructions how to govern her new master.\n\nThen she went to Jorian Ketel; for she said to herself, \"he is the\nclosest I ever met, so he is the man for me,\" and in concert with him\nshe did two mortal sly things; yet not, in my opinion, virulent, though\nshe thought they were; but if I am asked what were these deeds without\na name, the answer is, that as she, who was, 'but a woman,' kept them\nsecret till her dying day, I, who am a man--\"Verbum non amplius addam.\"\n\nShe kept away from Gouda parsonage.\n\nThings that pass little noticed in the heat of argument sometimes rankle\nafterwards; and when she came to go over all that had passed, she was\noffended at Gerard thinking she could ever forget the priest in the some\ntime lover, \"For what did he take me?\" said she. And this raised a great\nshyness which really she would not otherwise have felt, being downright\ninnocent, And pride sided with modesty, and whispered, \"Go no more to\nGouda parsonage.\"\n\nShe left little Gerard there to complete the conquest her maternal heart\nascribed to him, not to her own eloquence and sagacity, and to anchor\nhis father for ever to humanity.\n\nBut this generous stroke of policy cost her heart dear. She had never\nyet been parted from her boy an hour, and she felt sadly strange as well\nas desolate without him. After the first day it became intolerable; and\nwhat does the poor soul do, but creep at dark up to Gouda parsonage, and\nlurk about the premises like a thief till she saw Reicht Heynes in the\nkitchen alone, Then she tapped softly at the window and said, \"Reicht,\nfor pity's sake bring him out to me unbeknown.\" With Margaret the person\nwho occupied her thoughts at the time ceased to have a name, and sank to\na pronoun.\n\nReicht soon found an excuse for taking little Gerard out, and there was\na scene of mutual rapture, followed by mutual tears when mother and boy\nparted again.\n\nAnd it was arranged that Reicht should take him half way to Rotterdam\nevery day, at a set hour, and Margaret meet them. And at these meetings,\nafter the raptures, and after mother and child had gambolled together\nlike a young cat and her first kitten, the boy would sometimes amuse\nhimself alone at their feet, and the two women generally seized this\nopportunity to talk very seriously about Luke Peterson, This began thus:\n\n\"Reicht,\" said Margaret, \"I as good as promised him to marry Luke\nPeterson. 'Say you the word,' quoth I, 'and I'll wed him.'\"\n\n\"Poor Luke!\"\n\n\"Prithee, why poor Luke?\"\n\n\"To be bandied about so, atwixt yea and nay.\"\n\n\"Why, Reicht, you have not ever been so simple as to cast an eye of\naffection on the boy, that you take his part?\"\n\n\"Me?\" said Reicht, with a toss of the head.\n\n\"Oh, I ask your pardon. Well, then, you can do me a good turn.\"\n\n\"Whisht! whisper! that little darling is listening to every word, and\neyes like saucers.\"\n\nOn this both their heads would have gone under one cap.\n\nTwo women plotting against one boy? Oh, you great cowardly serpents!\n\nBut when these stolen meetings had gone on for about five days Margaret\nbegan to feel the injustice of it, and to be irritated as well as\nunhappy.\n\nAnd she was crying about it when a cart came to her door, and in it,\nclean as a new penny, his beard close shaved, his hands white as snow,\nand a little colour in his pale face, sat the Vicar of Gouda in the grey\nfrock and large felt hat she had sent him.\n\nShe ran upstairs directly, and washed away all traces of her tears,\nand put on a cap, which being just taken out of the drawer was cleaner,\ntheoretically, than the one she had on, and came down to him.\n\nHe seized both her hands and kissed them, and a tear fell upon them. She\nturned her head away at that to hide her own which started.\n\n\"My sweet Margaret,\" he cried, \"why is this? Why hold you aloof from\nyour own good deed? we have been waiting for you every day, and no\nMargaret.\"\n\n\"You said things.\"\n\n\"What! when I was a hermit, and a donkey.\"\n\n\"Ay! no matter, you said things. And you had no reason.\"\n\n\"Forget all I said there. Who hearkens the ravings of a maniac? for I\nsee now that in a few months more I should have been a gibbering idiot;\nyet no mortal could have persuaded me away but you. Oh what an outlay of\nwit and goodness was yours! But it is not here I can thank and bless\nyou as I ought. No, it is in the home you have given me, among the sheep\nwhose shepherd you have made me; already I love them dearly; there it\nis I must thank 'the truest friend ever man had.' So now I say to you as\nerst you said to me, come to Gouda manse.\"\n\n\"Humph! we will see about that.\"\n\n\"Why, Margaret, think you I had ever kept the dear child so long, but\nthat I made sure you would be back to him from day to day? Oh he curls\nround my very heartstrings, but what is my title to him compared to\nthine? Confess now, thou hast had hard thoughts of me for this.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, not I. Ah! thou art thyself again; wast ever thoughtful of\nothers. I have half a mind to go to Gouda manse, for your saying that.\"\n\n\"Come then, with half thy mind, 'tis worth the whole of other folk's.\"\n\n\"Well, I dare say I will; but there is no such mighty hurry,\" said she\ncoolly (she was literally burning to go). \"Tell me first how you agree\nwith your folk.\"\n\n\"Why, already my poor have taken root in my heart.\"\n\n\"I thought as much.\"\n\n\"And there are such good creatures among them; simple and rough, and\nsuperstitious, but wonderfully good.\"\n\n\"Oh I leave you alone for seeing a grain of good among a bushel of ill.\"\n\n\"Whisht! whisht! And Margaret, two of them have been ill friends for\nfour years, and came to the manse each to get on my blind side. But give\nthe glory to God I got on their bright side, and made them friends, and\nlaugh at themselves for their folly.\"\n\n\"But are you in very deed their vicar? answer me that.\"\n\n\"Certes; have I not been to the bishop and taken the oath, and rung the\nchurch bell, and touched the altar, the missal, and the holy cup before\nthe church-wardens? And they have handed me the parish seal; see, here\nit is. Nay, 'tis a real vicar inviting a true friend to Gouda manse.\"\n\n\"Then my mind is at ease. Tell me oceans more.\"\n\n\"Well, sweet one, nearest to me of all my parish is a poor cripple that\nmy guardian angel and his (her name thou knowest even by this turning of\nthy head away) hath placed beneath my roof. Sybrandt and I are that we\nnever were till now, brothers. 'Twould gladden thee, yet sadden thee to\nhear how we kissed and forgave one another. He is full of thy praises,\nand wholly in a pious mind; he says he is happier since his trouble than\ne'er he was in the days of his strength. Oh! out of my house he ne'er\nshall go to any place but heaven.\"\n\n\"Tell me somewhat that happened thyself, poor soul! All this is good,\nbut yet no tidings to me. Do I not know thee of old?\"\n\n\"Well, let me see. At first I was much dazzled by the sun-light,\nand could not go abroad (owl!), but that is passed; and good Reicht\nHeynes--humph!\"\n\n\"What of her?\"\n\n\"This to thine ear only, for she is a diamond. Her voice goes through\nme like a knife, and all voices seem loud but thine, which is so mellow\nsweet. Stay, now I'll fit ye with tidings; I spake yesterday with an old\nman that conceits he is ill-tempered, and sweats to pass for such with\nothers, but oh! so threadbare, and the best good heart beneath.\"\n\n\"Why, 'tis a parish of angels,\" said Margaret ironically.\n\n\"Then why dost thou keep out on't?\" retorted Gerard. \"Well, he was\ntelling me there was no parish in Holland where the devil hath such\npower as at Gouda; and among his instances, says he, 'We had a hermit,\nthe holiest in Holland; but being Gouda, the devil came for him this\nweek, and took him, bag and baggage; not a ha'porth of him left but a\ngoodish piece of his skin, just for all the world like a hedgehog's, and\na piece o' old iron furbished up.'\"\n\nMargaret smiled.\n\n\"Ay, but,\" continued Gerard, \"the strange thing is, the cave has verily\nfallen in; and had I been so perverse as resist thee, it had assuredly\nburied me dead there where I had buried myself alive. Therefore in\nthis I see the finger of Providence, condemning my late, approving my\npresent, way of life. What sayest thou?\"\n\n\"Nay, can I pierce the like mysteries? I am but a woman.\"\n\n\"Somewhat more, methinks. This very tale proves thee my guardian angel,\nand all else avouches it, so come to Gouda manse.\"\n\n\"Well, go you on, I'll follow.\"\n\n\"Nay, in the cart with me.\"\n\n\"Not so.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Can I tell why and wherefore, being a woman? All I know is I seem--to\nfeel--to wish--to come alone.\"\n\n\"So be it then. I leave thee the cart, being, as thou sayest, a woman,\nand I'll go a-foot, being a man again, with the joyful tidings of thy\ncoming.\"\n\nWhen Margaret reached the manse the first thing she saw was the two\nGerards together, the son performing his capriccios on the plot, and the\nfather slouching on a chair, in his great hat, with pencil and paper,\ntrying very patiently to sketch him.\n\nAfter a warm welcome he showed her his attempts. \"But in vain I strive\nto fix him,\" said he, \"for he is incarnate quick silver, Yet do but note\nhis changes, infinite, but none ungracious; all is supple and easy; and\nhow he melteth from one posture to another,\" He added presently, \"Woe to\nilluminators I looking on thee, sir baby, I see what awkward, lopsided,\nungainly toads I and my fellows painted missals with, and called them\ncherubs and seraphs,\" Finally he threw the paper away in despair, and\nMargaret conveyed it secretly into her bosom.\n\nAt night when they sat round the peat fire he bade them observe how\nbeautiful the brass candlesticks and other glittering metals were in\nthe glow from the hearth. Catherine's eyes sparkled at this observation,\n\"And oh the sheets I lie in here,\" said he, \"often my conscience\npricketh me, and saith, 'Who art thou to lie in lint like web of snow?'\nDives was ne'er so flaxed as I. And to think that there are folk in\nthe world that have all the beautiful things which I have here yet not\ncontent. Let them pass six months in a hermit's cell, seeing no face of\nman, then will they find how lovely and pleasant this wicked world is,\nand eke that men and women are God's fairest creatures. Margaret was\nalways fair, but never to my eye so bright as now.\" Margaret shook her\nhead incredulously, Gerard continued, \"My mother was ever good and kind,\nbut I noted not her exceeding comeliness till now.\"\n\n\"Nor I neither,\" said Catherine; \"a score years ago I might pass in a\ncrowd, but not now.\"\n\nGerard declared to her that each age had its beauty. \"See this mild grey\neye,\" said he, \"that hath looked motherly love upon so many of us,\nall that love hath left its shadow, and that shadow is a beauty which\ndefieth Time. See this delicate lip, these pure white teeth. See this\nwell-shaped brow, where comliness Just passeth into reverence. Art\nbeautiful in my eyes, mother dear.\"\n\n\"And that is enough for me, my darling, 'Tis time you were in bed,\nchild. Ye have to preach the morn.\"\n\nAnd Reicht Heynes and Catherine interchanged a look which said, \"We two\nhave an amiable maniac to superintend; calls everything beautiful.\"\n\nThe next day was Sunday, and they heard him preach in his own church. It\nwas crammed with persons, who came curious, but remained devout. Never\nwas his wonderful gift displayed more powerfully; he was himself deeply\nmoved by the first sight of all his people, and his bowels yearned over\nthis flock he had so long neglected. In a single sermon, which lasted\ntwo hours and seemed to last but twenty minutes, he declared the whole\nscripture: he terrified the impenitent and thoughtless, confirmed the\nwavering, consoled the bereaved and the afflicted, uplifted the heart\nof the poor, and when he ended, left the multitude standing rapt, and\nunwilling to believe the divine music of his voice and soul had ceased.\n\nNeed I say that two poor women in a corner sat entranced, with streaming\neyes.\n\n\"Wherever gat he it all?\" whispered Catherine, with her apron to her\neyes. \"By our Lady not from me.\"\n\nAs soon as they were by themselves Margaret threw her arms round\nCatherine's neck and kissed her.\n\n\"Mother, mother, I am not quite a happy woman, but oh I am a proud one.\"\n\nAnd she vowed on her knees never by word or deed to let her love come\nbetween this young saint and Heaven.\n\nReader, did you ever stand by the seashore after a storm, when the wind\nhappens to have gone down suddenly? The waves cannot cease with their\ncause; indeed, they seem at first to the ear to lash the sounding shore\nmore fiercely than while the wind blew. Still we are conscious that\ninevitable calm has begun, and is now but rocking them to sleep. So it\nwas with those true and tempest-tossed lovers from that eventful night\nwhen they went hand in hand beneath the stars from Gouda hermitage to\nGouda manse.\n\nAt times a loud wave would every now and then come roaring, but it was\nonly memory's echo of the tempest that had swept their lives; the storm\nitself was over, and the boiling waters began from that moment to go\ndown, down, down, gently, but inevitably.\n\nThis image is to supply the place of interminable details that would be\ntedious and tame. What best merits attention at present is the general\nsituation, and the strange complication of feeling that arose from it.\nHistory itself, though a far more daring story-teller than romance,\npresents few things so strange(1) as the footing on which Gerard and\nMargaret now lived for many years. United by present affection, past\nfamiliarity, and a marriage irregular but legal; separated by Holy\nChurch and by their own consciences, which sided unreservedly with\nHoly Church; separated by the Church, but united by a living pledge of\naffection, lawful in every sense at its date.\n\nAnd living but a few miles from one another, and she calling his mother\n\"mother,\" For some years she always took her boy to Gouda on Sunday,\nreturning home at dark, Go when she would, it was always fete at Gouda\nmanse, and she was received like a little queen. Catherine in these days\nwas nearly always with her, and Eli very often, Tergou had so little to\ntempt them compared with Rotterdam; and at last they left it altogether,\nand set up in the capital.\n\nAnd thus the years glided; so barren now of striking incidents, so void\nof great hopes, and free from great fears, and so like one another,\nthat without the help of dates I could scarcely indicate the progress of\ntime.\n\nHowever, early next year, 1471, the Duchess of Burgundy, with the open\ndissent, but secret connivance of the Duke, raised forces to enable her\ndethroned brother, Edward the Fourth of England, to invade that kingdom;\nour old friend Denys thus enlisted, and passing through Rotterdam to the\nships, heard on his way that Gerard was a priest, and Margaret alone. On\nthis he told Margaret that marriage was not a habit of his, but that as\nhis comrade had put it out of his own power to keep troth, he felt bound\nto offer to keep it for him; \"for a comrade's honour is dear to us as\nour own,\" said he.\n\nShe stared, then smiled, \"I choose rather to be still thy she-comrade,\"\nsaid she; \"closer acquainted, we might not agree so well,\" And in her\ncharacter of she-comrade she equipped him with a new sword of Antwerp\nmake, and a double handful of silver. \"I give thee no gold,\" said she,\n\"for 'tis thrown away as quick as silver, and harder to win back. Heaven\nsend thee safe out of all thy perils; there be famous fair women yonder\nto beguile thee, with their faces, as well as men to hash thee with\ntheir axes.\"\n\nHe was hurried on board at La Vere, and never saw Gerard at that time.\n\nIn 1473 Sybrandt began to fail. His pitiable existence had been\nsweetened by his brother's inventive tenderness and his own contented\nspirit, which, his antecedents considered, was truly remarkable, As for\nGerard, the day never passed that he did not devote two hours to him;\nreading or singing to him, praying with him, and drawing him about in a\nsoft carriage Margaret and he had made between them. When the poor soul\nfound his end near, he begged Margaret might be sent for. She came\nat once, and almost with his last breath he sought once more that\nforgiveness she had long ago accorded. She remained by him till the\nlast; and he died, blessing and blessed, in the arms of the two true\nlovers he had parted for life. Tantum religio scit suadere boni.\n\n1474 there was a wedding in Margaret's house, Luke Peterson and Reicht\nHeynes.\n\nThis may seem less strange if I give the purport of the dialogue\ninterrupted some time back.\n\nMargaret went on to say, \"Then in that case you can easily make him\nfancy you, and for my sake you must, for my conscience it pricketh me,\nand I must needs fit him with a wife, the best I know.\" Margaret then\ninstructed Reicht to be always kind and good-humoured to Luke; and she\nwould be a model of peevishness to him, \"But be not thou so simple as\nrun me down,\" said she, \"Leave that to me. Make thou excuses for me; I\nwill make myself black enow.\"\n\nReicht received these instructions like an order to sweep a room, and\nobeyed them punctually.\n\nWhen they had subjected poor Luke to this double artillery for a couple\nof years, he got to look upon Margaret as his fog and wind, and Reicht\nas his sunshine; and his affections transferred themselves, he scarce\nknew how or when.\n\nOn the wedding day Reicht embraced Margaret, and thanked her almost\nwith tears. \"He was always my fancy,\" said she, \"from the first hour I\nclapped eyes on him.\"\n\n\"Heyday, you never told me that. What, Reicht, are you as sly as the\nrest?\"\n\n\"Nay, nay,\" said Reicht eagerly; \"but I never thought you would really\npart with him to me. In my country the mistress looks to be served\nbefore the maid.\"\n\nMargaret settled them in her shop, and gave them half the profits.\n\n1476 and 7 were years of great trouble to Gerard, whose conscience\ncompelled him to oppose the Pope. His Holiness, siding with the Grey\nFriars in their determination to swamp every palpable distinction\nbetween the Virgin Mary and her Son, bribed the Christian world into his\ncrotchet by proffering pardon of all sins to such as would add to\nthe Ave Mary this clause: \"and blessed be thy Mother Anna, from whom,\nwithout blot of sin, proceeded thy virgin flesh.\"\n\nGerard, in common with many of the northern clergy, held this sentence\nto be flat heresy. He not only refused to utter it in his church, but\nwarned his parishioners against using it in private; and he refused to\ncelebrate the new feast the Pope invented at the same time, viz., \"the\nfeast of the miraculous conception of the Virgin.\"\n\nBut this drew upon him the bitter enmity of the Franciscans, and they\nwere strong enough to put him into more than one serious difficulty, and\ninflict many a little mortification on him. In emergencies he consulted\nMargaret, and she always did one of two things, either she said, \"I do\nnot see my way,\" and refused to guess; or else she gave him advice that\nproved wonderfully sagacious. He had genius, but she had marvellous\ntact.\n\nAnd where affection came in and annihilated the woman's judgment, he\nstepped in his turn to her aid. Thus though she knew she was spoiling\nlittle Gerard, and Catherine was ruining him for life, she would not\npart with him, but kept him at home, and his abilities uncultivated. And\nthere was a shrewd boy of nine years, instead of learning to work\nand obey, playing about and learning selfishness from their infinite\nunselfishness, and tyrannizing with a rod of iron over two women, both\nof them sagacious and spirited, but reduced by their fondness for him to\nthe exact level of idiots.\n\nGerard saw this with pain, and interfered with mild but firm\nremonstrance; and after a considerable struggle prevailed, and got\nlittle Gerard sent to the best school in Europe, kept by one Haaghe at\nDeventer: this was in 1477. Many tears were shed, but the great progress\nthe boy made at that famous school reconciled Margaret in some degree,\nand the fidelity of Reicht Heynes, now her partner in business, enabled\nher to spend weeks at a time hovering over her boy at Deventer.\n\nAnd so the years glided; and these two persons, subjected to as strong\nand constant a temptation as can well be conceived, were each other's\nguardian angels, and not each other's tempters.\n\nTo be sure the well-greased morality of the next century, which taught\nthat solemn vows to God are sacred in proportion as they are reasonable,\nhad at that time entered no single mind; and the alternative to these\ntwo minds was self-denial or sacrilege.\n\nIt was a strange thing to hear them talk with unrestrained tenderness to\none another of their boy, and an icy barrier between themselves all the\ntime.\n\nEight years had now passed thus, and Gerard, fairly compared with men in\ngeneral, was happy.\n\nBut Margaret was not.\n\nThe habitual expression of her face was a sweet pensiveness, but\nsometimes she was irritable and a little petulant. She even snapped\nGerard now and then. And when she went to see him, if a monk was with\nhim she would turn her back and go home. She hated the monks for having\nparted Gerard and her, and she inoculated her boy with a contempt for\nthem which lasted him till his dying day.\n\nGerard bore with her like an angel. He knew her heart of gold, and hoped\nthis ill gust would blow over.\n\nHe himself being now the right man in the right place this many years,\nloving his parishioners, and beloved by them, and occupied from morn\ntill night in good works, recovered the natural cheerfulness of his\ndisposition. To tell the truth, a part of his jocoseness was a blind; he\nwas the greatest peace-maker, except Mr. Harmony in the play, that ever\nwas born. He reconciled more enemies in ten years than his predecessors\nhad done in three hundred; and one of his manoeuvres in the peacemaking\nart was to make the quarrellers laugh at the cause of quarrel. So did\nhe undermine the demon of discord. But independently of that, he really\nloved a harmless joke. He was a wonderful tamer of animals, squirrels,\nbares, fawns, etc. So half in jest a parishioner who had a mule supposed\nto be possessed with a devil gave it him and said, \"Tame this vagabone,\nparson, if ye can.\" Well, in about six months, Heaven knows how, he\nnot only tamed Jack, but won his affections to such a degree, that Jack\nwould come running to his whistle like a dog.\n\nOne day, having taken shelter from a shower on the stone settle outside\na certain public-house, he heard a toper inside, a stranger, boasting he\ncould take more at a draught than any man in Gouda. He instantly marched\nin and said, \"What, lads, do none of ye take him up for the honour of\nGouda? Shall it be said that there came hither one from another parish a\ngreater sot than any of us? Nay, then, I your parson do take him up.\nGo to, I'll find thee a parishioner shall drink more at a draught than\nthou.\"\n\nA bet was made; Gerard whistled; in clattered Jack--for he was taught\nto come into a room with the utmost composure--and put his nose into his\nbacker's hand.\n\n\"A pair of buckets!\" shouted Gerard, \"and let us see which of these two\nsons of asses can drink most at a draught.\"\n\nOn another occasion two farmers had a dispute whose hay was the best.\nFailing to convince each other, they said, \"We'll ask parson;\" for by\nthis time he was their referee in every mortal thing.\n\n\"How lucky you thought of me!\" said Gerard, \"Why, I have got one staying\nwith me who is the best judge of hay in Holland. Bring me a double\nhandful apiece.\"\n\nSo when they came, he had them into the parlour, and put each bundle on\na chair. Then he whistled, and in walked Jack.\n\n\"Lord a mercy!\" said one of the farmers.\n\n\"Jack,\" said the parson, in the tone of conversation, \"just tell us\nwhich is the best hay of these two.\"\n\nJack sniffed them both, and made his choice directly, proving his\nsincerity by eating every morsel. The farmers slapped their thighs, and\nscratched their heads. \"To think of we not thinking o' that,\" And they\neach sent Jack a truss.\n\nSo Gerard got to be called the merry parson of Gouda. But Margaret, who\nlike most loving women had no more sense of humour than a turtle-dove,\ntook this very ill. \"What!\" said she to herself, \"is there nothing sore\nat the bottom of his heart that he can go about playing the zany?\" She\ncould understand pious resignation and content, but not mirth, in true\nlovers parted. And whilst her woman's nature was perturbed by this\ngust (and women seem more subject to gusts than men) came that terrible\nanimal, a busybody, to work upon her. Catherine saw she was not happy,\nand said to her, \"Your boy is gone from you. I would not live alone all\nmy days if I were you.\"\n\n\"He is more alone than I,\" sighed Margaret.\n\n\"Oh, a man is a man, but a woman is a woman. You must not think all of\nhim and none of yourself. Near is your kirtle, but nearer is your smock.\nBesides, he is a priest, and can do no better. But you are not a priest.\nHe has got his parish, and his heart is in that. Bethink thee! Time\nflies; overstay not thy market. Wouldst not like to have three or four\nmore little darlings about thy knee now they have robbed thee of poor\nlittle Gerard, and sent him to yon nasty school?\" And so she worked upon\na mind already irritated.\n\nMargaret had many suitors ready to marry her at a word or even a\nlook, and among them two merchants of the better class, Van Schelt and\nOostwagen. \"Take one of those two,\" said Catherine.\n\n\"Well, I will ask Gerard if I may,\" said Margaret one day, with a flood\nof tears; \"for I cannot go on the way I am.\"\n\n\"Why, you would never be so simple as ask him?\"\n\n\"Think you I would be so wicked as marry without his leave?\"\n\nAccordingly she actually went to Gouda, and after hanging her head, and\nblushing, and crying, and saying she was miserable, told him his mother\nwished her to marry one of those two; and if he approved of her marrying\nat all, would he use his wisdom, and tell her which he thought would be\nthe kindest to the little Gerard of those two; for herself, she did not\ncare what became of her.\n\nGerard felt as if she had put a soft hand into his body and torn his\nheart out with it. But the priest with a mighty effort mastered the man.\nIn a voice scarcely audible he declined this responsibility. \"I am not a\nsaint or a prophet,\" said he; \"I might advise thee ill. I shall read the\nmarriage service for thee,\" faltered he; \"it is my right. No other would\npray for thee as I should. But thou must choose for thyself; and oh! let\nme see thee happy. This four months past thou hast not been happy.\"\n\n\"A discontented mind is never happy,\" said Margaret.\n\nShe left him, and he fell on his knees, and prayed for help from above.\n\nMargaret went home pale and agitated. \"Mother,\" said she, \"never mention\nit to me again, or we shall quarrel.\"\n\n\"He forbade you? Well, more shame for him, that is all.\"\n\n\"He forbid me? He did not condescend so far. He was as noble as I\nwas paltry. He would not choose for me for fear of choosing me an ill\nhusband. But he would read the service for my groom and me; that was his\nright. Oh, mother, what a heartless creature I was!\"\n\n\"Well, I thought not he had that much sense.\"\n\n\"Ah, you go by the poor soul's words, but I rate words as air when\nthe face speaketh to mine eye. I saw the priest and the true lover\na-fighting in his dear face, and his cheek pale with the strife, and oh!\nhis poor lip trembled as he said the stout-hearted words--Oh! oh! oh!\noh! oh! oh! oh!\" And Margaret burst into a violent passion of tears.\n\nCatherine groaned. \"There, give it up without more ado,\" said she. \"You\ntwo are chained together for life; and if God is merciful, that won't be\nfor long; for what are you neither maid, wife, nor widow.\"\n\n\"Give it up?\" said Margaret; \"that was done long ago. All I think of now\nis comforting him; for now I have been and made him unhappy too, wretch\nand monster that I am.\"\n\nSo the next day they both went to Gouda. And Gerard, who had been\npraying for resignation all this time, received her with peculiar\ntenderness as a treasure he was to lose; but she was agitated and eager\nto let him see without words that she would never marry, and she fawned\non him like a little dog to be forgiven. And as she was going away she\nmurmured, \"Forgive! and forget! I am but a woman.\"\n\nHe misunderstood her, and said, \"All I bargain for is, let me see thee\ncontent; for pity's sake, let me not see thee unhappy as I have this\nwhile.\"\n\n\"My darling, you never shall again,\" said Margaret, with streaming eyes,\nand kissed his hand.\n\nHe misunderstood this too at first; but when month after month\npassed, and he heard no more of her marriage, and she came to Gouda\ncomparatively cheerful, and was even civil to Father Ambrose, a mild\nbenevolent monk from the Dominican convent hard by--then he understood\nher; and one day he invited her to walk alone with him in the sacred\npaddock; and before I relate what passed between them, I must give its\nhistory.\n\nWhen Gerard had been four or five days at the manse, looking out of\nwindow he uttered an exclamation of joy. \"Mother, Margaret, here is one\nof my birds: another, another: four, six, nine. A miracle! a miracle!\"\n\n\"Why, how can you tell your birds from their fellows?\" said Catherine.\n\n\"I know every feather in their wings. And see; there is the little\ndarling whose claw I gilt, bless it!\"\n\nAnd presently his rapture took a serious turn, and he saw Heaven's\napprobation in this conduct of the birds as he did in the fall of the\ncave. This wonderfully kept alive his friendship for animals; and he\nenclosed a paddock, and drove all the sons of Cain from it with threats\nof excommunication, \"On this little spot of earth we'll have no murder,\"\nsaid he. He tamed leverets and partridges, and little birds, and hares,\nand roe-deer. He found a squirrel with a broken leg; he set it with\ninfinite difficulty and patience; and during the cure showed it\nrepositories of acorns, nuts, chestnuts, etc. And this squirrel got well\nand went off, but visited him in hard weather, and brought a mate, and\nnext year little squirrels were found to have imbibed their parents'\nsentiments, and of all these animals each generation was tamer than the\nlast. This set the good parson thinking, and gave him the true clue to\nthe great successes of mediaeval hermits in taming wild animals.\n\nHe kept the key of this paddock, and never let any man but himself\nenter it; nor would he even let little Gerard go there without him or\nMargaret. \"Children are all little Cains,\" said he. In this oasis, then,\nhe spoke to Margaret, and said, \"Dear Margaret, I have thought more than\never of thee of late, and have asked myself why I am content, and thou\nunhappy.\"\n\n\"Because thou art better, wiser, holier than I; that is all,\" said\nMargaret promptly.\n\n\"Our lives tell another tale,\" said Gerard thoughtfully. \"I know thy\ngoodness and thy wisdom too well to reason thus perversely. Also I know\nthat I love thee as dear as thou, I think, lovest me. Yet am I happier\nthan thou. Why is this so?\"\n\n\"Dear Gerard, I am as happy as a woman can hope to be this side of the\ngrave.\"\n\n\"Not so happy as I. Now for the reason. First, then, I am a priest, and\nthis, the one great trial and disappointment God giveth me along with so\nmany joys, why, I share it with a multitude. For alas! I am not the only\npriest by thousands that must never hope for entire earthly happiness.\nHere, then, thy lot is harder than mine.\"\n\n\"But Gerard, I have my child to love. Thou canst not fill thy heart with\nhim as his mother can, So you may set this against you.\"\n\n\"And I have ta'en him from thee; it was cruel; but he would have broken\nthy heart one day if I had not. Well then, sweet one, I come to where\nthe shoe pincheth, methinks. I have my parish, and it keeps my heart\nin a glow from morn till night. There is scarce an emotion that my folk\nstir not up in me many times a day. Often their sorrows make me weep,\nsometimes their perversity kindles a little wrath, and their absurdity\nmakes me laugh, and sometimes their flashes of unexpected goodness do\nset me all of a glow, and I could hug 'em. Meantime thou, poor soul,\nsittest with heart--\n\n\"Of lead, Gerard; of very lead.\"\n\n\"See now how unkind thy lot compared with mine, Now how if thou couldst\nbe persuaded to warm thyself at the fire that warmeth me.\"\n\n\"Ah, if I could?\"\n\n\"Hast but to will it. Come among my folk. Take in thine hand the alms I\nset aside, and give it with kind words; hear their sorrows: they shall\nshow you life is full of troubles, and as thou sayest truly, no man or\nwoman without their thorn this side the grave. Indoors I have a map of\nGouda parish. Not to o'erburden thee at first, I will put twenty housen\nunder thee with their folk. What sayest thou? but for thy wisdom I had\ndied a dirty maniac,' and ne'er seen Gouda manse, nor pious peace. Wilt\nprofit in turn by what little wisdom I have to soften her lot to whom I\ndo owe all?\"\n\nMargaret assented warmly, and a happy thing it was for the little\ndistrict assigned to her; it was as if an angel had descended on them.\nHer fingers were never tired of knitting or cutting for them, her\nheart of sympathizing with them. And that heart expanded and waved its\ndrooping wings; and the glow of good and gentle deed began to spread\nover it; and she was rewarded in another way by being brought into more\ncontact with Gerard, and also with his spirit. All this time malicious\ntongues had not been idle. \"If there is nought between them more than\nmeets the eye, why doth she not marry?\" etc. And I am sorry to say our\nold friend Joan Ketel was one of these coarse sceptics. And now one\nwinter evening she got on a hot scent. She saw Margaret and Gerard\ntalking earnestly together on the Boulevard. She whipped behind a tree.\n\"Now I'll hear something,\" said she; and so she did. It was winter;\nthere had been one of those tremendous floods followed by a sharp\nfrost, and Gerard in despair as to where he should lodge forty or fifty\nhouseless folk out of the piercing cold. And now it was, \"Oh, dear, dear\nMargaret, what shall I do? The manse is full of them, and a sharp frost\ncoming on this night.\"\n\nMargaret reflected, and Joan listened.\n\n\"You must lodge them in the church,\" said Margaret quietly.\n\n\"In the church? Profanation.\"\n\n\"No; charity profanes nothing, not even a church; soils nought, not even\na church. To-day is but Tuesday. Go save their lives, for a bitter night\nis coming. Take thy stove into the church, and there house them. We will\ndispose of them here and there ere the lord's day.\"\n\n\"And I could not think of that; bless thee, sweet Margaret, thy mind is\nstronger than mine, and readier.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, a woman looks but a little way, therefore she sees clear.\nI'll come over myself to-morrow.\"\n\nAnd on this they parted with mutual blessings.\n\nJoan glided home remorseful.\n\nAnd after that she used to check all surmises to their discredit.\n\"Beware,\" she would say, \"lest some angel should blister thy tongue.\nGerard and Margaret paramours? I tell ye they are two saints which meet\nin secret to plot charity to the poor.\"\n\nIn the summer of 1481 Gerard determined to provide against similar\ndisasters recurring to his poor. Accordingly he made a great hole in his\nincome, and bled his friends (zealous parsons always do that) to build a\nlarge Xenodochium to receive the victims of flood or fire. Giles and all\nhis friends were kind, but all was not enough; when lo! the Dominican\nmonks of Gouda to whom his parlour and heart had been open for years,\ncame out nobly, and put down a handsome sum to aid the charitable vicar.\n\n\"The dear good souls,\" said Margaret; \"who would have thought it?\"\n\n\"Any one who knows them,\" said Gerard, \"Who more charitable than monks?\"\n\n\"Go to! They do but give the laity back a pig of their own sow.\"\n\n\"And what more do I? What more doth the duke?\"\n\nThen the ambitious vicar must build almshouses for decayed true men in\ntheir old age close to the manse, that he might keep and feed them, as\nwell as lodge them. And his money being gone, he asked Margaret for a\nfew thousand bricks and just took off his coat and turned builder; and\nas he had a good head, and the strength of a Hercules, with the zeal of\nan artist, up rose a couple of almshouses parson built.\n\nAnd at this work Margaret would sometimes bring him his dinner, and\nadd a good bottle of Rhenish. And once seeing him run up a plank with a\nwheelbarrow full of bricks which really most bricklayers would have\ngone staggering under, she said, \"Times are changed since I had to carry\nlittle Gerard for thee.\"\n\n\"Ay, dear one, thanks to thee.\"\n\nWhen the first home was finished, the question was who they should put\ninto it; and being fastidious over it like a new toy, there was much\nhesitation. But an old friend arrived in time to settle this question.\n\nAs Gerard was passing a public-house in Rotterdam one day, he heard a\nwell-known voice, He looked up, and there was Denys of Burgundy, but\nsadly changed; his beard stained with grey, and his clothes worn and\nragged; he had a cuirass still, and gauntlets, but a staff instead of an\narbalest, To the company he appeared to be bragging and boasting, but in\nreality he was giving a true relation of Edward the Fourth's invasion of\nan armed kingdom with 2000 men, and his march through the country with\narmies capable of swallowing him looking on, his battles at Tewkesbury\nand Barnet, and reoccupation of his capital and kingdom in three months\nafter landing at the Humber with a mixed handful of Dutch, English, and\nBurgundians.\n\nIn this, the greatest feat of arms the century had seen, Denys had\nshone; and whilst sneering at the warlike pretensions of Charles the\nBold, a duke with an itch but no talent for fighting, and proclaiming\nthe English king the first captain of the age, did not forget to exalt\nhimself.\n\nGerard listened with eyes glittering affection and fun. \"And now,\" said\nDenys, \"after all these feats, patted on the back by the gallant young\nPrince of Gloucester, and smiled on by the great captain himself, here\nI am lamed for life; by what? by the kick of a horse, and this night I\nknow not where I shall lay my tired bones. I had a comrade once in these\nparts that would not have let me lie far from him; but he turned priest\nand deserted his sweetheart, so 'tis not likely he would remember his\ncomrade. And ten years play sad havoc with our hearts, and limbs, and\nall.\" Poor Denys sighed, and Gerard's bowels yearned over him.\n\n\"What words are these?\" he said, with a great gulp in his throat. \"Who\ngrudges a brave soldier supper and bed? Come home with me!\"\n\n\"Much obliged, but I am no lover of priests.\"\n\n\"Nor I of soldiers; but what is supper and bed between two true men?\"\n\n\"Not much to you, but something to me. I will come.\"\n\n\"In one hour,\" said Gerard, and went in high spirits to Margaret, and\ntold her the treat in store, and she must come and share it. She must\ndrive his mother in his little carriage up to the manse with all speed,\nand make ready an excellent supper. Then he himself borrowed a cart, and\ndrove Denys up rather slowly, to give the women time.\n\nOn the road Denys found out this priest was a kind soul, so told him his\ntrouble, and confessed his heart was pretty near broken. \"The great use\nour stout hearts, and arms, and lives till we are worn out, and then\nfling us away like broken tools.\" He sighed deeply, and it cost Gerard\na great struggle not to hug him then and there, and tell him. But he\nwanted to do it all like a story book. Who has not had this fancy once\nin his life? Why Joseph had it; all the better for us.\n\nThey landed at the little house. It was as clean as a penny, the hearth\nblazing, and supper set.\n\nDenys brightened up. \"Is this your house, reverend sir?\"\n\n\"Well, 'tis my work, and with these hands, but 'tis your house.\"\n\n\"Ah, no such luck,\" said Denys, with a sigh.\n\n\"But I say ay,\" shouted Gerard. \"And what is more I--\" (gulp) \"say--\"\n(gulp) \"COURAGE, CAMARADE, LE DIABLE EST MORT!\"\n\nDenys started, and almost staggered. \"Why, what?\" he stammered,\n\"w-wh-who art thou, that bringest me back the merry words and merry days\nof my youth?\" and he was greatly agitated.\n\n\"My poor Denys, I am one whose face is changed, but nought else; to my\nheart, dear, trusty comrade, to my heart,\" And he opened his arms, with\nthe tears in his eyes. But Denys came close to him, and peered in his\nface, and devoured every feature; and when he was sure it was really\nGerard, he uttered a cry so vehement it brought the women running from\nthe house, and fell upon Gerard's neck, and kissed him again and again,\nand sank on his knees, and laughed and sobbed with joy so terribly,\nthat Gerard mourned his folly in doing dramas. But the women with their\ngentle soothing ways soon composed the brave fellow, and he sat smiling,\nand holding Margaret's hand and Gerard's, And they all supped together,\nand went to their beds with hearts warm as a toast; and the broken\nsoldier was at peace, and in his own house, and under his comrade's\nwing.\n\nHis natural gaiety returned, and he resumed his consigne after eight\nyears' disuse, and hobbled about the place enlivening it; but offended\nthe parish mortally by calling the adored vicar comrade, and nothing but\ncomrade.\n\nWhen they made a fuss about this to Gerard, he just looked in their\nfaces and said, \"What does it matter? Break him of swearing, and you\nshall have my thanks.\"\n\nThis year Margaret went to a lawyer to make her will, for without this,\nshe was told, her boy might have trouble some day to get his own, not\nbeing born in lawful wedlock. The lawyer, however, in conversation,\nexpressed a different opinion.\n\n\"This is the babble of churchmen,\" said he, \"Yours is a perfect\nmarriage, though an irregular one.\"\n\nHe then informed her that throughout Europe, excepting only the southern\npart of Britain, there were three irregular marriages, the highest of\nwhich was hers, viz., a betrothal before witnesses, \"This,\" said he, \"if\nnot followed by matrimonial intercourse, is a marriage complete in form,\nbut incomplete in substance. A person so betrothed can forbid any other\nbanns to all eternity. It has, however, been set aside where a party\nso betrothed contrived to get married regularly, and children were born\nthereafter. But such a decision was for the sake of the offspring,\nand of doubtful justice. However, in your case the birth of your\nchild closes that door, and your marriage is complete both in form and\nsubstance. Your course, therefore, is to sue for your conjugal rights;\nit will be the prettiest case of the century. The law is all on our\nside, the Church all on theirs. If you come to that, the old Batavian\nlaw, which compelled the clergy to marry, hath fallen into disuse, but\nwas never formally repealed.\"\n\nMargaret was quite puzzled. \"What are you driving at, sir? Who am I to\ngo to law with?\"\n\n\"Who is the defendant? Why, the vicar of Gouda.\"\n\n\"Alas, poor soul! And for what shall I law him?\"\n\n\"Why, to make him take you into his house, and share bed and board with\nyou, to be sure.\"\n\nMargaret turned red as fire, \"Gramercy for your rede,\" said she, \"What,\nis yon a woman's part? Constrain a man to be hers by force? That is\nmen's way of wooing, not ours. Say I were so ill a woman as ye think me,\nI should set myself to beguile him, not to law him;\" and she departed,\ncrimson with shame and indignation.\n\n\"There is an impracticable fool for you,\" said the man of art.\n\nMargaret had her will drawn elsewhere, and made her boy safe from\npoverty, marriage or no marriage.\n\nThese are the principal incidents that in ten whole years befell two\npeaceful lives, which in a much shorter period had been so thronged with\nadventures and emotions.\n\nTheir general tenor was now peace, piety, the mild content that lasts,\nnot the fierce bliss ever on tiptoe to depart, and above all, Christian\ncharity.\n\nOn this sacred ground these two true lovers met with an uniformity and\na kindness of sentiment which went far to soothe the wound in their own\nhearts, To pity the same bereaved; to hunt in couples all the ills\nin Gouda, and contrive and scheme together to remedy all that were\nremediable; to use the rare insight into troubled hearts which their\nown troubles had given them, and use it to make others happier than\nthemselves--this was their daily practice. And in this blessed cause\ntheir passions for one another cooled a little, but their affection\nincreased.\n\nFrom this time Margaret entered heart and soul into Gerard's pious\ncharities, that affection purged itself of all mortal dross. And as\nit had now long out-lived scandal and misapprehension, one would have\nthought that so bright an example of pure self-denying affection was to\nremain long before the world, to show men how nearly religious faith,\neven when not quite reasonable, and religious charity, which is always\nreasonable, could raise two true lovers' hearts to the loving hearts\nof the angels of heaven. But the great Disposer of events ordered\notherwise.\n\nLittle Gerard rejoiced both his parents' hearts by the extraordinary\nprogress he made at Alexander Haaghe's famous school at Deventer.\n\nThe last time Margaret returned from visiting him, she came to Gerard\nflushed with pride. \"Oh, Gerard, he will be a great man one day, thanks\nto thy wisdom in taking him from us silly women. A great scholar, one\nZinthius, came to see the school and judge the scholars, and didn't our\nGerard stand up, and not a line in Horace or Terence could Zinthius cite\nbut the boy would follow him with the rest. 'Why, 'tis a prodigy,' says\nthat great scholar; and there was his poor mother stood by and heard it.\nAnd he took our Gerard in his arms, and kissed him; and what think you\nhe said?\"\n\n\"Nay, I know not.\"\n\n\"'Holland will hear of thee one day; and not Holland only, but all the\nworld,' Why what a sad brow!\"\n\n\"Sweet one, I am as glad as thou, yet am I uneasy to hear the child is\nwise before his time, I love him dear; but he is thine idol, and Heaven\ndoth often break our idols.\"\n\n\"Make thy mind easy,\" said Margaret. \"Heaven will never rob me of my\nchild. What I was to suffer in this world I have suffered, For if any\nill happened my child or thee, I should not live a week. The Lord He\nknows this, and He will leave me my boy.\"\n\nA month had elapsed after this; but Margaret's words were yet ringing in\nhis ears, when, going on his daily round of visits to his poor, he was\ntold quite incidentally, and as mere gossip, that the plague was at\nDeventer, carried thither by two sailors from Hamburgh.\n\nHis heart turned cold within him. News did not gallop in those days. The\nfatal disease must have been there a long time before the tidings would\nreach Gouda. He sent a line by a messenger to Margaret, telling her that\nhe was gone to fetch little Gerard to stay at the manse a little while,\nand would she see a bed prepared, for he should be back next day. And so\nhe hoped she would not hear a word of the danger till it was all happily\nover. He borrowed a good horse, and scarce drew rein till he reached\nDeventer, quite late in the afternoon. He went at once to the school.\nThe boy had been taken away.\n\nAs he left the school he caught sight of Margaret's face at the window\nof a neighbouring house she always lodged at when she came to Deventer.\n\nHe ran hastily to scold her and pack both her and the boy out of the\nplace.\n\nTo his surprise the servant told him with some hesitation that Margaret\nhad been there, but was gone.\n\n\"Gone, woman?\" said Gerard indignantly, \"art not ashamed to say so? Why,\nI saw her but now at the window.\"\n\n\"Oh, if you saw her--\"\n\nA sweet voice above said, \"Stay him not, let him enter.\" It was\nMargaret.\n\nGerard ran up the stairs to her, and went to take her hand, She drew\nback hastily.\n\nHe looked astounded.\n\n\"I am displeased,\" she said coldly. \"What makes you here? Know you not\nthe plague is in the town?\"\n\n\"Ay, dear Margaret; and came straightway to take our boy away.\"\n\n\"What, had he no mother?\"\n\n\"How you speak to me! I hoped you knew not.\"\n\n\"What, think you I leave my boy unwatched? I pay a trusty woman that\nnotes every change in his cheek when I am not here, and lets me know, I\nam his mother.\"\n\n\"Where is he?\"\n\n\"In Rotterdam, I hope, ere this.\"\n\n\"Thank Heaven! And why are you not there?\"\n\n\"I am not fit for the journey; never heed me; go you home on the\ninstant; I'll follow. For shame of you to come here risking your\nprecious life.\"\n\n\"It is not so precious as thine,\" said Gerard. \"But let that pass; we\nwill go home together, and on the instant.\"\n\n\"Nay, I have some matters to do in the town. Go thou at once, and I will\nfollow forthwith.\"\n\n\"Leave thee alone in a plague-stricken town? To whom speak you, dear\nMargaret?\"\n\n\"Nay, then, we shall quarrel, Gerard.\"\n\n\"Methinks I see Margaret and Gerard quarrelling! Why, it takes two to\nquarrel, and we are but one.\"\n\nWith this Gerard smiled on her sweetly. But there was no kind responsive\nglance. She looked cold, gloomy, and troubled.\n\nHe sighed, and sat patiently down opposite her with his face all puzzled\nand saddened. He said nothing, for he felt sure she would explain her\ncapricious conduct, or it would explain itself.\n\nPresently she rose hastily, and tried to reach her bedroom, but on the\nway she staggered and put out her hand. He ran to her with a cry of\nalarm. She swooned in his arms. He laid her gently on the ground, and\nbeat her cold hands, and ran to her bedroom, and fetched water, and\nsprinkled her pale face. His own was scarce less pale, for in a basin he\nhad seen water stained with blood; it alarmed him, he knew not why.\nShe was a long time ere she revived, and when she did she found Gerard\nholding her hand, and bending over her with a look of infinite concern\nand tenderness. She seemed at first as if she responded to it, but the\nnext moment her eyes dilated, and she cried--\"Ah, wretch, leave my hand;\nhow dare you touch me?\"\n\n\"Heaven help her!\" said Gerard. \"She is not herself.\"\n\n\"You will not leave me, then, Gerard?\" said she faintly. \"Alas! why do I\nask? Would I leave thee if thou wert--At least touch me not, and then I\nwill let thee bide, and see the last of poor Margaret. She ne'er spoke\nharsh to thee before, sweetheart, and she never will again.\"\n\n\"Alas! what mean these dark words, these wild and troubled looks?\" said\nGerard, clasping his hands.\n\n\"My poor Gerard,\" said Margaret, \"forgive me that I spoke so to thee. I\nam but a woman, and would have spared thee a sight will make thee weep.\"\nShe burst into tears. \"Ah, me!\" she cried, weeping, \"that I cannot keep\ngrief from thee; there is a great sorrow before my darling, and this\ntime I shall not be able to come and dry his eyes.\"\n\n\"Let it come, Margaret, so it touch not thee,\" said Gerard, trembling.\n\n\"Dearest,\" said Margaret solemnly, \"call now religion to thine aid and\nmine. I must have died before thee one day, or else outlived thee and so\ndied of grief.\"\n\n\"Died? thou die? I will never let thee die. Where is thy pain? What is\nthy trouble?\"\n\n\"The plague,\" she said calmly. Gerard uttered a cry of horror, and\nstarted to his feet; she read his thought. \"Useless,\" said she quietly.\n\"My nose hath bled; none ever yet survived to whom that came along with\nthe plague. Bring no fools hither to babble over the body they cannot\nsave. I am but a woman; I love not to be stared at; let none see me die\nbut thee.\"\n\nAnd even with this a convulsion seized her, and she remained sensible\nbut speechless a long time.\n\nAnd now for the first time Gerard began to realize the frightful truth,\nand he ran wildly to and fro, and cried to Heaven for help, as drowning\nmen cry to their fellow-creatures. She raised herself on her arm, and\nset herself to quiet him.\n\nShe told him she had known the torture of hopes and fears, and was\nresolved to spare him that agony. \"I let my mind dwell too much on the\ndanger,\" said she, \"and so opened my brain to it, through which door\nwhen this subtle venom enters it makes short work. I shall not be\nspotted or loathsome, my poor darling; God is good, and spares thee\nthat; but in twelve hours I shall be a dead woman. Ah, look not so, but\nbe a man; be a priest! Waste not one precious minute over my body! it is\ndoomed; but comfort my parting soul.\"\n\nGerard, sick and cold at heart, kneeled down, and prayed for help from\nHeaven to do his duty.\n\nWhen he rose from his knees his face was pale and old, but deadly calm\nand patient. He went softly and brought her bed into the room, and laid\nher gently down and supported her head with pillows. Then he prayed by\nher side the prayers for the dying, and she said Amen to each prayer.\nThen for some hours she wandered, but when the fell disease had quite\nmade sure of its prey, her mind cleared, and she begged Gerard to shrive\nher. \"For oh, my conscience it is laden,\" she said sadly.\n\n\"Confess thy sins to me, my daughter: let there be no reserve.\"\n\n\"My father,\" said she sadly, \"I have one great sin on my breast this\nmany years. E'en now that death is at my heart I can scarce own it. But\nthe Lord is debonair; if thou wilt pray to Him, perchance He may forgive\nme.\"\n\n\"Confess it first, my daughter.\"\n\n\"I--alas!\"\n\n\"Confess it!\"\n\n\"I deceived thee. This many years I have deceived thee.\"\n\nHere tears interrupted her speech.\n\n\"Courage, my daughter, courage,\" said Gerard kindly, overpowering the\nlover in the priest.\n\nShe hid her face in her hands, and with many sighs told him it was she\nwho had broken down the hermit's cave with the help of Jorian Ketel, \"I,\nshallow, did it but to hinder thy return thither; but when thou sawest\ntherein the finger of God, I played the traitress, and said, 'While he\nthinks so, he will ne'er leave Gouda manse;' and I held my tongue. Oh,\nfalse heart.\"\n\n\"Courage, my daughter; thou dost exaggerate a trivial fault.\"\n\n\"Ah, but 'tis not all, The birds.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"They followed thee not to Gouda by miracle, but by my treason. I said,\nhe will ne'er be quite happy without his birds that visited him in his\ncell; and I was jealous of them, and cried, and said, these foul little\nthings, they are my child's rivals. And I bought loaves of bread, and\nJorian and me we put crumbs at the cave door, and thence went sprinkling\nthem all the way to the manse, and there a heap. And my wiles succeeded,\nand they came, and thou wast glad, and I was pleased to see thee\nglad; and when thou sawest in my guile the finger of Heaven, wicked,\ndeceitful, I did hold my tongue. But die deceiving thee? ah, no, I could\nnot. Forgive me if thou canst; I was but a woman; I knew no better at\nthe time. 'Twas writ in my bosom with a very sunbeam. ''Tis good for him\nto bide at Gouda manse.'\"\n\n\"Forgive thee, sweet innocent?\" sobbed Gerard; \"what have I to forgive?\nThou hadst a foolish froward child to guide to his own weal, and\ndidst all this for the best, I thank thee and bless thee. But as thy\nconfessor, all deceit is ill in Heaven's pure eyes. Therefore thou\nhast done well to confess and report it; and even on thy confession\nand penitence the Church through me absolves thee. Pass to thy graver\nfaults.\"\n\n\"My graver faults? Alas! alas! Why, what have I done to compare? I am\nnot an ill woman, not a very ill one. If He can forgive me deceiving\nthee, He can well forgive me all the rest ever I did.\"\n\nBeing gently pressed, she said she was to blame not to have done more\ngood in the world. \"I have just begun to do a little,\" she said, \"and\nnow I must go. But I repine not, since 'tis Heaven's will, only I am so\nafeard thou wilt miss me.\" And at this she could not restrain her tears,\nthough she tried hard.\n\nGerard struggled with his as well as he could; and knowing her life of\npiety, purity, and charity, and seeing that she could not in her\npresent state realise any sin but her having deceived him, gave her\nfull absolution, Then he put the crucifix in her hand, and while he\nconsecrated the oil, bade her fix her mind neither on her merits nor her\ndemerits, but on Him who died for her on the tree.\n\nShe obeyed him with a look of confiding love and submission.\n\nAnd he touched her eyes with the consecrated oil, and prayed aloud\nbeside her.\n\nSoon after she dosed.\n\nHe watched beside her, more dead than alive himself.\n\nWhen the day broke she awoke, and seemed to acquire some energy. She\nbegged him to look in her box for her marriage lines and for a picture,\nand bring them both to her. He did so. She then entreated him by all\nthey had suffered for each other, to ease her mind by making a solemn\nvow to execute her dying requests.\n\nHe vowed to obey them to the letter.\n\n\"Then, Gerard, let no creature come here to lay me out. I could not bear\nto be stared at; my very corpse would blush. Also I would not be made\na monster of for the worms to sneer at as well as feed on. Also my very\nclothes are tainted, and shall to earth with me. I am a physician's\ndaughter; and ill becomes me kill folk, being dead, which did so little\ngood to men in the days of health; wherefore lap me in lead, the way I\nam, and bury me deep! yet not so deep but what one day thou mayst find\nthe way, and lay thy bones by mine.\n\n\"Whiles I lived I went to Gouda but once or twice a week. It cost me not\nto go each day. Let me gain this by dying, to be always at dear Gouda,\nin the green kirkyard.\n\n\"Also they do say the spirit hovers where the body lies; I would have my\nspirit hover near thee, and the kirkyard is not far from the manse. I am\nso afeard some ill will happen thee, Margaret being gone.\n\n\"And see, with mine own hands I place my marriage lines in my bosom. Let\nno living hand move them, on pain of thy curse and mine. Then when the\nangel comes for me at the last day, he shall say, this is an honest\nwoman, she hath her marriage lines (for you know I am your lawful wife,\nthough Holy Church hath come between us), and he will set me where the\nhonest women be. I will not sit among ill women, no, not in heaven\nfor their mind is not my mind, nor their soul my soul. I have stood,\nunbeknown, at my window, and heard their talk.\"\n\nFor some time she was unable to say any more, but made signs to him that\nshe had not done.\n\nAt last she recovered her breath, and bade him look at the picture.\n\nIt was the portrait he had made of her when they were young together,\nand little thought to part so soon. He held it in his hands and looked\nat it, but could scarce see it. He had left it in fragments, but now it\nwas whole.\n\n\"They cut it to pieces, Gerard; but see, Love mocked at their knives.\n\n\"I implore thee with my dying breath, let this picture hang ever in\nthine eye.\n\n\"I have heard that such as die of the plague, unspotted, yet after death\nspots have been known to come out; and oh, I could not bear thy last\nmemory of me to be so. Therefore, as soon as the breath is out of my\nbody, cover my face with this handkerchief, and look at me no more till\nwe meet again, 'twill not be so very long. O promise.\"\n\n\"I promise,\" said Gerard, sobbing.\n\n\"But look on this picture instead. Forgive me; I am but a woman. I could\nnot bear my face to lie a foul thing in thy memory. Nay, I must have\nthee still think me as fair as I was true. Hast called me an angel once\nor twice; but be just! did I not still tell thee I was no angel, but\nonly a poor simple woman, that whiles saw clearer than thou because she\nlooked but a little way, and that loves thee dearly, and never loved but\nthee, and now with her dying breath prays thee indulge her in this, thou\nthat art a man.\"\n\n\"I will, I will. Each word, each wish, is sacred.\"\n\n\"Bless thee! Bless thee! So then the eyes that now can scarce see thee,\nthey are so troubled by the pest, and the lips that shall not touch thee\nto taint thee, will still be before thee as they were when we were young\nand thou didst love me.\"\n\n\"When I did love thee, Margaret! Oh, never loved I thee as now.\"\n\n\"Hast not told me so of late.\"\n\n\"Alas! hath love no voice but words? I was a priest; I had charge of\nthy soul; the sweet offices of a pure love were lawful; words of love\nimprudent at the least. But now the good fight is won, ah me! Oh my\nlove, if thou hast lived doubting of thy Gerard's heart, die not so; for\nnever was woman loved so tenderly as thou this ten years past.\"\n\n\"Calm thyself, dear one,\" said the dying woman, with a heavenly smile.\n\"I know it; only being but a woman, I could not die happy till I had\nheard thee say so. Ah! I have pined ten years for those sweet words.\nHast said them, and this is the happiest hour of my life. I had to die\nto get them; well, I grudge not the price.\"\n\nFrom this moment a gentle complacency rested on her fading features. But\nshe did not speak.\n\nThen Gerard, who had loved her soul so many years, feared lest she\nshould expire with a mind too fixed on earthly affection.\n\n\"Oh my daughter,\" he cried, \"my dear daughter, if indeed thou lovest me\nas I love thee, give me not the pain of seeing thee die with thy pious\nsoul fixed on mortal things.\n\n\"Dearest lamb of all my fold, for whose soul I must answer, oh think not\nnow of mortal love, but of His who died for thee on the tree. Oh, let\nthy last look be heavenwards, thy last word a word of prayer.\"\n\nShe turned a look of gratitude and obedience on him. \"What saint?\"\nshe murmured: meaning doubtless, \"what saint should she invoke as an\nintercessor.\"\n\n\"He to whom the saints themselves do pray.\"\n\nShe turned on him one more sweet look of love and submission, and put\nher pretty hands together in a prayer like a child.\n\n\"Jesu!\"\n\nThis blessed word was her last. She lay with her eyes heavenwards, and\nher hands put together.\n\nGerard prayed fervently for her passing spirit. And when he had prayed a\nlong time with his head averted, not to see her last breath, all seemed\nunnaturally still. He turned his head fearfully. It was so.\n\nShe was gone.\n\nNothing left him now but the earthly shell of as constant, pure, and\nloving a spirit as eve' adorned the earth.\n\n     (1) Let me not be understood to apply this to the bare\n     outline of the relation. Many bishops and priests, and not a\n     few popes, had wives and children as laymen; and entering\n     orders were parted from the wives and not from the children.\n     But in the case before the reader are the additional\n     features of a strong surviving attachment on both sides, and\n     of neighbourhood, besides that here the man had been led\n     into holy orders by a false statement of the woman's death.\n     On a summary of all the essential features, the situation\n     was, to the best of my belief, unique.\n\n\nCHAPTER XCVII\n\nA priest is never more thoroughly a priest than in the chamber of death,\nGerard did the last offices of the Church for the departed, just as\nhe should have done them for his smallest parishioner. He did this\nmechanically, then sat down stupefied by the sudden and tremendous blow,\nand not yet realizing the pangs of bereavement. Then in a transport of\nreligious enthusiasm he kneeled and thanked Heaven for her Christian\nend.\n\nAnd then all his thought was to take her away from strangers, and lay\nher in his own churchyard. That very evening a covered cart with one\nhorse started for Gouda, and in it was a coffin, and a broken-hearted\nman lying with his arms and chin resting on it.\n\nThe mourner's short-lived energy had exhausted itself in the necessary\npreparations, and now he lay crushed, clinging to the cold lead that\nheld her.\n\nThe man of whom the cart was hired walked by the horse's head and did\nnot speak to him, and when he baited the horse spoke but in a whisper\nrespecting that mute agony. But when he stopped for the night, he and\nthe landlord made a well-meaning attempt to get the mourner away to take\nsome rest and food. But Gerard repulsed them, and when they persisted,\nalmost snarled at them, like a faithful dog, and clung to the cold lead\nall night. So then they drew a cloak over him, and left him in peace.\n\nAnd at noon the sorrowful cart came up to the manse, and there were\nfull a score of parishioners collected with one little paltry trouble or\nanother. They had missed the parson already. And when they saw what it\nwas, and saw their healer so stricken down, they raised a loud wail of\ngrief, and it roused him from his lethargy of woe, and he saw where he\nwas, and their faces, and tried to speak to them, \"Oh, my children! my\nchildren!\" he cried; but choked with anguish, could say no more.\n\nYet the next day, spite of all remonstrances, he buried her himself,\nand read the service with a voice that only trembled now and then, Many\ntears fell upon her grave. And when the service ended he stayed there\nstanding like a statue, and the people left the churchyard out of\nrespect.\n\nHe stood like one in a dream till the sexton, who was, as most men are,\na fool, began to fill in the grave without giving him due warning.\n\nBut at the sound of earth falling on her Gerard uttered a piercing\nscream.\n\nThe sexton forbore.\n\nGerard staggered and put his hand to his breast. The sexton supported\nhim, and called for help.\n\nJorian Ketel, who lingered near mourning his benefactress, ran into the\nchurchyard, and the two supported Gerard into the manse.\n\n\"Ah, Jorian! good Jorian!\" said he, \"something snapped within me; I\nfelt it, and I heard it; here, Jorian, here;\" and he put his hand to his\nbreast.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCVIII\n\nA fortnight after this a pale bowed figure entered the Dominican convent\nin the suburbs of Gouda, and sought speech with Brother Ambrose, who\ngoverned the convent as deputy, the prior having lately died, and his\nsuccessor, though appointed, not having arrived.\n\nThe sick man was Gerard, come to end life as he began it.\n\nHe entered as a novice, on probation; but the truth was, he was a\nfailing man, and knew it, and came there to die in peace, near kind and\ngentle Ambrose, his friend, and the other monks to whom his house and\nheart had always been open.\n\nHis manse was more than he could bear; it was too full of reminiscences\nof her.\n\nAmbrose, who knew his value, and his sorrow, was not without a kindly\nhope of curing him, and restoring him to his parish. With this view he\nput him in a comfortable cell over the gateway, and forbade him to fast\nor practice any austerities.\n\nBut in a few days the new prior arrived, and proved a very Tartar.\nAt first he was absorbed in curing abuses, and tightening the general\ndiscipline; but one day hearing the vicar of Gouda had entered the\nconvent as a novice, he said, \"'Tis well; let him first give up his\nvicarage then, or go; I'll no fat parsons in my house.\" The prior then\nsent for Gerard, and he went to him; and the moment they saw one another\nthey both started.\n\n\"Clement!\"\n\n\"Jerome!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XCIX\n\nJerome was as morose as ever in his general character, but he had\nsomewhat softened towards Gerard. All the time he was in England he\nhad missed him more then he thought possible, and since then had often\nwondered what had become of him. What he heard in Gouda raised his\nfeeble brother in his good opinion; above all, that he had withstood\nthe Pope and the Minorites on \"the infernal heresy of the immaculate\nconception,\" as he called it. But when one of his young monks told him\nwith tears in his eyes the Cause of Gerard's illness, all his contempt\nrevived. \"Dying for a woman?\"\n\nHe determined to avert this scandal; he visited Clement twice a day\nin his cell, and tried all his old influence and all his eloquence to\ninduce him to shake off this unspiritual despondency, and not rob the\nchurch of his piety and his eloquence at so critical a period.\n\nGerard heard him, approved his reasoning, admired his strength,\nconfessed his own weakness, and continued visibly to wear away to the\nland of the leal. One day Jerome told him he had heard his story, and\nheard it with pride. \"But now,\" said he, \"you spoil it all, Clement; for\nthis is the triumph of earthly passion. Better have yielded to it and\nrepented, than resist it while she lived, and succumb under it now, body\nand soul.\"\n\n\"Dear Jerome,\" said Clement, so sweetly as to rob his remonstrance of\nthe tone of remonstrance, \"here, I think, you do me some injustice.\nPassion there is none; but a deep affection, for which I will not blush\nhere, since I shall not blush for it in heaven. Bethink thee, Jerome,\nthe poor dog that dies of grief on his master's grave, is he guilty of\npassion? Neither am I. Passion had saved my life, and lost my soul, She\nwas my good angel; she sustained me in my duty and charity; her face\nencouraged me in the pulpit; her lips soothed me under ingratitude. She\nintertwined herself with all that was good in my life; and after leaning\non her so long, I could not go on alone. And, dear Jerome, believe me\nI am no rebel against Heaven. It is God's will to release me. When they\nthrew the earth upon her poor coffin, something snapped within my bosom\nhere that mended may not be. I heard it, and I felt it. And from that\ntime, Jerome, no food that I put in my mouth had any savour. With my\neyes bandaged now I could not tell thee which was bread, and which was\nflesh, by eating of it.\"\n\n\"Holy saints!\"\n\n\"And again, from that same hour my deep dejection left me, and I smiled\nagain. I often smile--why? I read it thus: He in whose hands are the\nissues of life and death gave me that minute the great summons; 'twas\nsome cord of life snapped in me. He is very pitiful. I should have lived\nunhappy; but He said, 'No; enough is done, enough is suffered; poor\nfeeble, loving servant, thy shortcomings are forgiven, thy sorrows touch\nthine end; come thou to thy rest!' I come, Lord, I come!\"\n\nJerome groaned. \"The Church had ever her holy but feeble servants,\" he\nsaid. \"Now would I give ten years of my life to save thine. But I see it\nmay not be. Die in peace.\"\n\nAnd so it was that in a few days more Gerard lay a-dying in a frame\nof mind so holy and happy, that more than one aged saint was there to\ngarner his dying words. In the evening he had seen Giles, and begged him\nnot to let poor Jack starve; and to see that little Gerard's trustees\ndid their duty, and to kiss his parents for him, and to send Denys\nto his friends in Burgundy: \"Poor thing, he will feel so strange here\nwithout his comrade.\" And after that he had an interview with Jerome\nalone. What passed between them was never distinctly known; but it must\nhave been something remarkable, for Jerome went from the door with his\nhands crossed on his breast, his high head lowered, and sighing as he\nwent.\n\nThe two monks that watched with him till matins related that all through\nthe night he broke out from time to time in pious ejaculations, and\npraises, and thanksgivings; only once they said he wandered, and thought\nhe saw her walking in green meadows with other spirits clad in white,\nand beckoning him; and they all smiled and beckoned him. And both these\nmonks said (but it might have been fancy) that just before dawn there\ncame three light taps against the wall, one after another, very slow;\nand the dying man heard them, and said.\n\n\"I come, love, I come.\"\n\nThis much is certain, that Gerard did utter these words, and prepare\nfor his departure, having uttered them. He sent for all the monks who at\nthat hour were keeping vigil. They came, and hovered like gentle spirits\nround him with holy words. Some prayed in silence for him with their\nfaces touching the ground, others tenderly supported his head. But when\none of them said something about his life of self-denial and charity, he\nstopped him, and addressing them all said, \"My dear brethren, take note\nthat he who here dies so happy holds not these new-fangled doctrines of\nman's merit. Oh, what a miserable hour were this to me an if I did!\nNay, but I hold, with the Apostles, and their pupils in the Church, the\nancient fathers, that we are justified not by our own wisdom, or piety,\nor the works we have done in holiness of heart, but by faith.'\"(1)\n\nThen there was silence, and the monks looked at one another\nsignificantly.\n\n\"Please you sweep the floor,\" said the dying Christian, in a voice to\nwhich all its clearance and force seemed supernaturally restored.\n\nThey instantly obeyed, not without a sentiment of awe and curiosity.\n\n\"Make me a great cross with wood ashes.\"\n\nThey strewed the ashes in form of a great Cross upon the floor.\n\n\"Now lay me down on it, for so will I die.\"\n\nAnd they took him gently from his bed, and laid him on the cross of wood\nashes.\n\n\"Shall we spread out thine arms, dear brother?\"\n\n\"Now God forbid! Am I worthy of that?\"\n\nHe lay silent, but with his eyes raised in ecstasy.\n\nPresently he spoke half to them, half to himself, \"Oh,\" he said, with\na subdued but concentrated rapture, \"I feel it buoyant. It lifts me\nfloating in the sky whence my merits had sunk me like lead.\"\n\nDay broke; and displayed his face cast upward in silent rapture, and his\nhands together; like Margaret's.\n\nAnd just about the hour she died he spoke his last word in this world.\n\n\"Jesu!\"\n\nAnd even with that word--he fell asleep.\n\nThey laid him out for his last resting-place.\n\nUnder his linen they found a horse-hair shirt.\n\n\"Ah!\" cried the young monks, \"behold a saint!\"\n\nUnder the hair cloth they found a long thick tress of auburn hair.\n\nThey started, and were horrified; and a babel of voices arose, some\ncondemning, some excusing.\n\nIn the midst of which Jerome came in, and hearing the dispute, turned to\nan ardent young monk called Basil, who was crying scandal the loudest,\n\"Basil,\" said he, \"is she alive or dead that owned this hair?\"\n\n\"How may I know, father?\"\n\n\"Then for aught you know it may be the relic of a saint?\"\n\n\"Certes it may be,\" said Basil sceptically.\n\n\"You have then broken our rule, which saith, 'Put ill construction on no\nact done by a brother which can be construed innocently.' Who are you\nto judge such a man as this was? go to your cell, and stir not out for a\nweek by way of penance.\"\n\nHe then carried off the lock of hair.\n\nAnd when the coffin was to be closed, he cleared the cell: and put the\ntress upon the dead man's bosom. \"There, Clement,\" said he to the dead\nface. And set himself a penance for doing it; and nailed the coffin up\nhimself.\n\nThe next day Gerard was buried in Gouda churchyard. The monks followed\nhim in procession from the convent. Jerome, who was evidently carrying\nout the wishes of the deceased, read the service. The grave was a deep\none, and at the bottom of it was a lead coffin. Poor Gerard's, light as\na feather (so wasted was he), was lowered, and placed by the side of it.\n\nAfter the service Jerome said a few words to the crowd of parishioners\nthat had come to take the last look at their best friend. When he spoke\nof the virtues of the departed loud wailing and weeping burst forth, and\ntears fell upon the coffin like rain.\n\nThe monks went home. Jerome collected them in the refectory and spoke to\nthem thus: \"We have this day laid a saint in the earth. The convent will\nkeep his trentals, but will feast, not fast; for our good brother is\nfreed from the burden of the flesh; his labours are over, and he has\nentered into his joyful rest. I alone shall fast, and do penance; for to\nmy shame I say it, I was unjust to him, and knew not his worth till it\nwas too late. And you, young monks, be not curious to inquire whether a\nlock he bore on his bosom was a token of pure affection or the relic of\na saint; but remember the heart he wore beneath: most of all, fix your\neyes upon his life and conversation, and follow them an ye may: for he\nwas a holy man.\"\n\nThus after life's fitful fever these true lovers were at peace.\n\nThe grave, kinder to them than the Church, united them for ever; and now\na man of another age and nation, touched with their fate, has laboured\nto build their tombstone, and rescue them from long and unmerited\noblivion.\n\nHe asks for them your sympathy, but not your pity.\n\nNo, put this story to a wholesome use.\n\nFiction must often give false views of life and death. Here as it\nhappens, curbed by history, she gives you true ones. Let the barrier\nthat kept these true lovers apart prepare you for this, that here on\nearth there will nearly always be some obstacle or other to your perfect\nhappiness; to their early death apply your Reason and your Faith, by\nway of exercise and preparation. For if you cannot bear to be told that\nthese died young, who had they lived a hundred years would still be\ndead, how shall you bear to see the gentle, the loving, and the true\nglide from your own bosom to the grave, and fly from your house to\nheaven?\n\nYet this is in store for you. In every age the Master of life and death,\nwho is kinder as well as wiser than we are, has transplanted to heaven,\nyoung, earth's sweetest flowers.\n\nI ask your sympathy, then, for their rare constancy and pure affection,\nand their cruel separation by a vile heresy(2) in the bosom of the\nChurch; but not your pity for their early but happy end.\n\n'Beati sunt qui in Domino moriuntur.\n\n     (1) He was citing from Clement of Rome--\n\n     {ou di eautwn dikaioumetha oude dia tys ymeteras\n     sophias, y eusebeias y ergwn wn kateirgasametha en\n     osioteeti karthias, alla dia tys pistews}.\n     --Epist.ad Corinth, i. 32.\n\n(2) Celibacy of the clergy, an invention truly fiendish.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER C\n\nIn compliance with a Custom I despise, but have not the spirit to\nresist, I linger on the stage to pick up the smaller fragments of\nhumanity I have scattered about; i.e. some of them, for the wayside\ncharacters have no claim on me; they have served their turn if they have\npersuaded the reader that Gerard travelled from Holland to Rome through\nhuman beings, and not through a population of dolls.\n\nEli and Catherine lived to a great age: lived so long, that both Gerard\nand Margaret grew to be dim memories. Giles also was longaevous; he went\nto the court of Bavaria, and was alive there at ninety, but had somehow\nturned into bones and leather, trumpet toned.\n\nCornelis, free from all rivals, and forgiven long ago by his mother, who\nclung to him more and more now all her brood was scattered, waited and\nwaited and waited for his parents' decease. But Catherine's shrewd word\ncame true; ere she and her mate wore out, this worthy rusted away. At\nsixty-five he lay dying of old age in his mother's arms, a hale woman\nof eighty-six. He had lain unconscious a while, but came to himself\nin articulo mortis, and seeing her near him, told her how he would\ntransform the shop and premises as soon as they should be his. \"Yes, my\ndarling,\" said the poor old woman soothingly, and in another minute he\nwas clay, and that clay was followed to the grave by all the feet whose\nshoes he had waited for.\n\nDenys, broken-hearted at his comrade's death, was glad to return to\nBurgundy, and there a small pension the court allowed him kept him until\nunexpectedly he inherited a considerable sum from a relation. He was\nknown in his native place for many years as a crusty old soldier,\nwho could tell good stories of war when he chose, and a bitter railer\nagainst women.\n\nJerome, disgusted with northern laxity, retired to Italy, and having\nhigh connections became at seventy a mitred abbot. He put on the screw\nof discipline; his monks revered and hated him. He ruled with iron rod\nten years. And one night he died, alone; for he had not found the way to\na single heart. The Vulgate was on his pillow, and the crucifix in his\nhand, and on his lips something more like a smile than was ever seen\nthere while he lived; so that, methinks, at that awful hour he was not\nquite alone. Requiescat in pace. The Master he served has many servants,\nand they have many minds, and now and then a faithful one will be a\nsurly one, as it is in these our mortal mansions.\n\nThe yellow-haired laddie, Gerard Gerardson, belongs not to Fiction but\nto History. She has recorded his birth in other terms than mine. Over\nthe tailor's house in the Brede Kirk Straet she has inscribed:\n\n\"HAEC EST PARVA DOMUS NATUS QUA MAGNUS ERASMUS,\"\n\nand she has written half-a-dozen lives of him. But there is something\nleft for her yet to do. She has no more comprehended magnum Erasmum,\nthan any other pigmy comprehends a giant, or partisan a judge.\n\nFirst scholar and divine of his epoch, he was also the heaven-born\ndramatist of his century. Some of the best scenes in this new book are\nfrom his mediaeval pen, and illumine the pages where they come; for the\nwords of a genius so high as his are not born to die: their immediate\nwork upon mankind fulfilled, they may seem to lie torpid; but at each\nfresh shower of intelligence Time pours upon their students, they prove\ntheir immortal race: they revive, they spring from the dust of great\nlibraries; they bud, they flower, they fruit, they seed, from generation\nto generation, and from age to age.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Cloister and the Hearth, by Charles Reade\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CLOISTER AND THE HEARTH ***\n\n***** This file should be named 1366.txt or 1366.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/3\/6\/1366\/\n\nProduced by Neil McLachlan and David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":139,"split":"train"}
