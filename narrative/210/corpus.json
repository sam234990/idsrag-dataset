{"ori_id":"311862def6b1e7d1cdf16a9b797f554e1dce866f","title":"Jo's Boys","context":"Jo's Boys\n The book mostly follows the lives of Plumfield boys who were introduced in Little Men, particularly Tommy, Emil, Demi, Nat, Dan, and Professor Bhaer and Jo's sons Rob and Teddy, although the others make frequent appearances as well. The book takes place ten years after Little Men. Dolly and George are college students dealing with the temptations of snobbery, arrogance, self-indulgence and vanity. Tommy becomes a medical student to impress childhood sweetheart Nan, but after \"accidentally\" falling in love with and proposing to Dora, he joins his family business.\nSections of Jo's Boys follow the travels of former students who have deep emotional ties to Plumfield and the Bhaers. Professor Bhaer's nephew Emil is now a sailor, and takes off on his first voyage as second mate and shows his true strength when he is shipwrecked and the captain badly injured. Dan seeks his fortune in the West and ends up in jail. He also falls in love with a person far beyond his reach, Jo's niece and Amy's daughter Bess. Nat begins a musical career in Europe that takes him away from Daisy, only to fall in with a frivolous crowd and unintentionally lead a young woman on, whom he then does not marry.\nRomance also plays a role in Jo's Boys, as both Franz and Emil find their own wives, and Tommy, Demi, Nat and Daisy are engaged by the end of the book. Nan remains single, dedicated to her medical career.\nDan ends up committing the one sin he and Jo always feared he would, though it was in defence of both self and a younger boy, Blair. Dan kills a man who cheats Blair in gambling. Dan is sentenced to a year in prison with hard labour and only just gets through. Following his release, he saves mine workers from drowning and is brought back home a hero, when he confides in Mother Bhaer about his sin and the punishment that followed. She also discovers his fancy for Bess, though is not entirely surprised. Dan tells her of this fancy and that Bess seemed like the bright northern star which guided him. However, knowing that Amy wouldn't approve, Jo makes sure that the Laurences are away when Dan leaves again. Sadly, Dan dies protecting the Indians but lies in peace as if Aslauga's Knight had done his duty.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Jo's Boys, by Louisa May Alcott\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

TEN YEARS LATER\n\n'If anyone had told me what wonderful changes were to take place here in\nten years, I wouldn't have believed it,' said Mrs Jo to Mrs Meg, as they\nsat on the piazza at Plumfield one summer day, looking about them with\nfaces full of pride and pleasure.\n\n'This is the sort of magic that money and kind hearts can work. I am\nsure Mr Laurence could have no nobler monument than the college he so\ngenerously endowed; and a home like this will keep Aunt March's memory\ngreen as long as it lasts,' answered Mrs Meg, always glad to praise the\nabsent.\n\n'We used to believe in fairies, you remember, and plan what we'd ask\nfor if we could have three wishes. Doesn't it seem as if mine had been\nreally granted at last? Money, fame, and plenty of the work I love,'\nsaid Mrs Jo, carelessly rumpling up her hair as she clasped her hands\nover her head just as she used to do when a girl.\n\n'I have had mine, and Amy is enjoying hers to her heart's content. If\ndear Marmee, John, and Beth were here, it would be quite perfect,' added\nMeg, with a tender quiver in her voice; for Marmee's place was empty\nnow.\n\nJo put her hand on her sister's, and both sat silent for a little while,\nsurveying the pleasant scene before them with mingled sad and happy\nthoughts.\n\nIt certainly did look as if magic had been at work, for quiet Plumfield\nwas transformed into a busy little world. The house seemed more\nhospitable than ever, refreshed now with new paint, added wings,\nwell-kept lawn and garden, and a prosperous air it had not worn when\nriotous boys swarmed everywhere and it was rather difficult for the\nBhaers to make both ends meet. On the hill, where kites used to be\nflown, stood the fine college which Mr Laurence's munificent legacy had\nbuilt. Busy students were going to and fro along the paths once trodden\nby childish feet, and many young men and women were enjoying all the\nadvantages that wealth, wisdom, and benevolence could give them.\n\nJust inside the gates of Plumfield a pretty brown cottage, very like\nthe Dovecote, nestled among the trees, and on the green slope westward\nLaurie's white-pillared mansion glittered in the sunshine; for when the\nrapid growth of the city shut in the old house, spoilt Meg's nest, and\ndared to put a soap-factory under Mr Laurence's indignant nose, our\nfriends emigrated to Plumfield, and the great changes began.\n\nThese were the pleasant ones; and the loss of the dear old people was\nsweetened by the blessings they left behind; so all prospered now in the\nlittle community, and Mr Bhaer as president, and Mr March as chaplain\nof the college, saw their long-cherished dream beautifully realized. The\nsisters divided the care of the young people among them, each taking\nthe part that suited her best. Meg was the motherly friend of the young\nwomen, Jo the confidante and defender of all the youths, and Amy the\nlady Bountiful who delicately smoothed the way for needy students, and\nentertained them all so cordially that it was no wonder they named her\nlovely home Mount Parnassus, so full was it of music, beauty, and the\nculture hungry young hearts and fancies long for.\n\nThe original twelve boys had of course scattered far and wide during\nthese years, but all that lived still remembered old Plumfield, and came\nwandering back from the four quarters of the earth to tell their various\nexperiences, laugh over the pleasures of the past, and face the duties\nof the present with fresh courage; for such home-comings keep hearts\ntender and hands helpful with the memories of young and happy days. A\nfew words will tell the history of each, and then we can go on with the\nnew chapter of their lives.\n\nFranz was with a merchant kinsman in Hamburg, a man of twenty-six now,\nand doing well. Emil was the jolliest tar that ever 'sailed the ocean\nblue'. His uncle sent him on a long voyage to disgust him with this\nadventurous life; but he came home so delighted with it that it was\nplain this was his profession, and the German kinsman gave him a good\nchance in his ships; so the lad was happy. Dan was a wanderer still; for\nafter the geological researches in South America he tried sheep-farming\nin Australia, and was now in California looking up mines. Nat was busy\nwith music at the Conservatory, preparing for a year or two in Germany\nto finish him off. Tom was studying medicine and trying to like it.\nJack was in business with his father, bent on getting rich. Dolly was in\ncollege with Stuffy and Ned reading law. Poor little Dick was dead, so\nwas Billy; and no one could mourn for them, since life would never be\nhappy, afflicted as they were in mind and body.\n\nRob and Teddy were called the 'Lion and the Lamb'; for the latter was\nas rampant as the king of beasts, and the former as gentle as any sheep\nthat ever baaed. Mrs Jo called him 'my daughter', and found him the\nmost dutiful of children, with plenty of manliness underlying the quiet\nmanners and tender nature. But in Ted she seemed to see all the faults,\nwhims, aspirations, and fun of her own youth in a new shape. With his\ntawny locks always in wild confusion, his long legs and arms, loud\nvoice, and continual activity, Ted was a prominent figure at Plumfield.\nHe had his moods of gloom, and fell into the Slough of Despond about\nonce a week, to be hoisted out by patient Rob or his mother, who\nunderstood when to let him alone and when to shake him up. He was her\npride and joy as well as torment, being a very bright lad for his age,\nand so full of all sorts of budding talent, that her maternal mind was\nmuch exercised as to what this remarkable boy would become.\n\nDemi had gone through College with honour, and Mrs Meg had set her heart\non his being a minister--picturing in her fond fancy the first sermon\nher dignified young parson would preach, as well as the long, useful,\nand honoured life he was to lead. But John, as she called him now,\nfirmly declined the divinity school, saying he had had enough of books,\nand needed to know more of men and the world, and caused the dear woman\nmuch disappointment by deciding to try a journalist's career. It was\na blow; but she knew that young minds cannot be driven, and that\nexperience is the best teacher; so she let him follow his own\ninclinations, still hoping to see him in the pulpit. Aunt Jo raged when\nshe found that there was to be a reporter in the family, and called him\n'Jenkins' on the spot. She liked his literary tendencies, but had reason\nto detest official Paul Prys, as we shall see later. Demi knew his own\nmind, however, and tranquilly carried out his plans, unmoved by the\ntongues of the anxious mammas or the jokes of his mates. Uncle Teddy\nencouraged him, and painted a splendid career, mentioning Dickens and\nother celebrities who began as reporters and ended as famous novelists\nor newspaper men.\n\nThe girls were all flourishing. Daisy, as sweet and domestic as ever,\nwas her mother's comfort and companion. Josie at fourteen was a most\noriginal young person, full of pranks and peculiarities, the latest of\nwhich was a passion for the stage, which caused her quiet mother and\nsister much anxiety as well as amusement. Bess had grown into a tall,\nbeautiful girl looking several years older than she was, with the same\ngraceful ways and dainty tastes which the little Princess had, and a\nrich inheritance of both the father's and mother's gifts, fostered by\nevery aid love and money could give. But the pride of the community\nwas naughty Nan; for, like so many restless, wilful children, she\nwas growing into a woman full of the energy and promise that suddenly\nblossoms when the ambitious seeker finds the work she is fitted to do\nwell. Nan began to study medicine at sixteen, and at twenty was getting\non bravely; for now, thanks to other intelligent women, colleges and\nhospitals were open to her. She had never wavered in her purpose from\nthe childish days when she shocked Daisy in the old willow by saying: 'I\ndon't want any family to fuss over. I shall have an office, with bottles\nand pestle things in it, and drive round and cure folks.' The future\nforetold by the little girl the young woman was rapidly bringing to\npass, and finding so much happiness in it that nothing could win her\nfrom the chosen work. Several worthy young gentlemen had tried to make\nher change her mind and choose, as Daisy did, 'a nice little house and\nfamily to take care of'. But Nan only laughed, and routed the lovers\nby proposing to look at the tongue which spoke of adoration, or\nprofessionally felt the pulse in the manly hand offered for her\nacceptance. So all departed but one persistent youth, who was such a\ndevoted Traddles it was impossible to quench him.\n\nThis was Tom, who was as faithful to his child sweetheart as she to\nher 'pestle things', and gave a proof of fidelity that touched her very\nmuch. He studied medicine for her sake alone, having no taste for it,\nand a decided fancy for a mercantile life. But Nan was firm, and\nTom stoutly kept on, devoutly hoping he might not kill many of his\nfellow-beings when he came to practise. They were excellent friends,\nhowever, and caused much amusement to their comrades, by the\nvicissitudes of this merry love-chase.\n\nBoth were approaching Plumfield on the afternoon when Mrs Meg and Mrs\nJo were talking on the piazza. Not together; for Nan was walking briskly\nalong the pleasant road alone, thinking over a case that interested her,\nand Tom was pegging on behind to overtake her, as if by accident, when\nthe suburbs of the city were past--a little way of his, which was part\nof the joke.\n\nNan was a handsome girl, with a fresh colour, clear eye, quick smile,\nand the self-poised look young women with a purpose always have. She was\nsimply and sensibly dressed, walked easily, and seemed full of vigour,\nwith her broad shoulders well back, arms swinging freely, and the\nelasticity of youth and health in every motion. The few people she met\nturned to look at her, as if it was a pleasant sight to see a hearty,\nhappy girl walking countryward that lovely day; and the red-faced young\nman steaming along behind, hat off and every tight curl wagging with\nimpatience, evidently agreed with them.\n\nPresently a mild 'Hallo!' was borne upon the breeze, and pausing, with\nan effort to look surprised that was an utter failure, Nan said affably:\n\n'Oh, is that you, Tom?'\n\n'Looks like it. Thought you might be walking out today'; and Tom's\njovial face beamed with pleasure.\n\n'You knew it. How is your throat?' asked Nan in her professional tone,\nwhich was always a quencher to undue raptures.\n\n'Throat? Oh, ah! yes, I remember. It is well. The effect of that\nprescription was wonderful. I'll never call homoeopathy a humbug again.'\n\n'You were the humbug this time, and so were the unmedicated pellets\nI gave you. If sugar or milk can cure diphtheria in this remarkable\nmanner, I'll make a note of it. O Tom, Tom, will you never be done\nplaying tricks?'\n\n'O Nan, Nan, will you never be done getting the better of me?' And the\nmerry pair laughed at one another just as they did in the old times,\nwhich always came back freshly when they went to Plumfield.\n\n'Well, I knew I shouldn't see you for a week if I didn't scare up some\nexcuse for a call at the office. You are so desperately busy all the\ntime I never get a word,' explained Tom.\n\n'You ought to be busy too, and above such nonsense. Really, Tom, if you\ndon't give your mind to your lectures, you'll never get on,' said Nan\nsoberly.\n\n'I have quite enough of them as it is,' answered Tom with an air of\ndisgust. 'A fellow must lark a bit after dissecting corpuses all day.\nI can't stand it long at a time, though some people seem to enjoy it\nimmensely.'\n\n'Then why not leave it, and do what suits you better? I always thought\nit a foolish thing, you know,' said Nan, with a trace of anxiety in the\nkeen eyes that searched for signs of illness in a face as ruddy as a\nBaldwin apple.\n\n'You know why I chose it, and why I shall stick to it if it kills me.\nI may not look delicate, but I've a deep-seated heart complaint, and it\nwill carry me off sooner or later; for only one doctor in the world can\ncure it, and she won't.'\n\nThere was an air of pensive resignation about Tom that was both comic\nand pathetic; for he was in earnest, and kept on giving hints of this\nsort, without the least encouragement.\n\nNan frowned; but she was used to it, and knew how to treat him.\n\n'She is curing it in the best and only way; but a more refractory\npatient never lived. Did you go to that ball, as I directed?'\n\n'I did.'\n\n'And devote yourself to pretty Miss West?'\n\n'Danced with her the whole evening.'\n\n'No impression made on that susceptible organ of yours?'\n\n'Not the slightest. I gaped in her face once, forgot to feed her, and\ngave a sigh of relief when I handed her over to her mamma.'\n\n'Repeat the dose as often as possible, and note the symptoms. I predict\nthat you'll \"cry for it\" by and by.'\n\n'Never! I'm sure it doesn't suit my constitution.'\n\n'We shall see. Obey orders!' sternly.\n\n'Yes, Doctor,' meekly.\n\nSilence reigned for a moment; then, as if the bone of contention was\nforgotten in the pleasant recollections called up by familiar objects,\nNan said suddenly:\n\n'What fun we used to have in that wood! Do you remember how you tumbled\nout of the big nut-tree and nearly broke your collar-bones?'\n\n'Don't I! and how you steeped me in wormwood till I was a fine mahogany\ncolour, and Aunt Jo wailed over my spoilt jacket,' laughed Tom, a boy\nagain in a minute.\n\n'And how you set the house afire?'\n\n'And you ran off for your band-box?'\n\n'Do you ever say \"Thunder-turtles\" now?'\n\n'Do people ever call you \"Giddy-gaddy\"?'\n\n'Daisy does. Dear thing, I haven't seen her for a week.'\n\n'I saw Demi this morning, and he said she was keeping house for Mother\nBhaer.'\n\n'She always does when Aunt Jo gets into a vortex. Daisy is a model\nhousekeeper; and you couldn't do better than make your bow to her, if\nyou can't go to work and wait till you are grown up before you begin\nlovering.'\n\n'Nat would break his fiddle over my head if I suggested such a thing.\nNo, thank you. Another name is engraved upon my heart as indelibly\nas the blue anchor on my arm. \"Hope\" is my motto, and \"No surrender\",\nyours; see who will hold out longest.'\n\n'You silly boys think we must pair off as we did when children; but we\nshall do nothing of the kind. How well Parnassus looks from here!' said\nNan, abruptly changing the conversation again.\n\n'It is a fine house; but I love old Plum best. Wouldn't Aunt March stare\nif she could see the changes here?' answered Tom, as they both paused at\nthe great gate to look at the pleasant landscape before them.\n\nA sudden whoop startled them, as a long boy with a wild yellow head came\nleaping over a hedge like a kangaroo, followed by a slender girl, who\nstuck in the hawthorn, and sat there laughing like a witch. A pretty\nlittle lass she was, with curly dark hair, bright eyes, and a very\nexpressive face. Her hat was at her back, and her skirts a good deal the\nworse for the brooks she had crossed, the trees she had climbed, and the\nlast leap, which added several fine rents.\n\n'Take me down, Nan, please. Tom, hold Ted; he's got my book, and I\nwill have it,' called Josie from her perch, not at all daunted by the\nappearance of her friends.\n\nTom promptly collared the thief, while Nan picked Josie from among the\nthorns and set her on her feet without a word of reproof; for having\nbeen a romp in her own girlhood, she was very indulgent to like tastes\nin others. 'What's the matter, dear?' she asked, pinning up the longest\nrip, while Josie examined the scratches on her hands. 'I was studying my\npart in the willow, and Ted came slyly up and poked the book out of my\nhands with his rod. It fell in the brook, and before I could scrabble\ndown he was off. You wretch, give it back this moment or I'll box your\nears,' cried Josie, laughing and scolding in the same breath.\n\nEscaping from Tom, Ted struck a sentimental attitude, and with tender\nglances at the wet, torn young person before him, delivered Claude\nMelnotte's famous speech in a lackadaisical way that was irresistibly\nfunny, ending with 'Dost like the picture, love?' as he made an object\nof himself by tying his long legs in a knot and distorting his face\nhorribly.\n\nThe sound of applause from the piazza put a stop to these antics, and\nthe young folks went up the avenue together very much in the old style\nwhen Tom drove four in hand and Nan was the best horse in the team.\nRosy, breathless, and merry, they greeted the ladies and sat down on\nthe steps to rest, Aunt Meg sewing up her daughter's rags while Mrs\nJo smoothed the Lion's mane, and rescued the book. Daisy appeared in a\nmoment to greet her friend, and all began to talk.\n\n'Muffins for tea; better stay and eat 'em; Daisy's never fail,' said Ted\nhospitably.\n\n'He's a judge; he ate nine last time. That's why he's so fat,' added\nJosie, with a withering glance at her cousin, who was as thin as a lath.\n\n'I must go and see Lucy Dove. She has a whitlow, and it's time to lance\nit. I'll tea at college,' answered Nan, feeling in her pocket to be sure\nshe had not forgotten her case of instruments.\n\n'Thanks, I'm going there also. Tom Merryweather has granulated lids,\nand I promised to touch them up for him. Save a doctor's fee and be good\npractice for me. I'm clumsy with my thumbs,' said Tom, bound to be near\nhis idol while he could.\n\n'Hush! Daisy doesn't like to hear you saw-bones talk of your work.\nMuffins suit us better'; and Ted grinned sweetly, with a view to future\nfavours in the eating line.\n\n'Any news of the Commodore?' asked Tom.\n\n'He is on his way home, and Dan hopes to come soon. I long to see my\nboys together, and have begged the wanderers to come to Thanksgiving, if\nnot before,' answered Mrs Jo, beaming at the thought.\n\n'They'll come, every man of them, if they can. Even Jack will risk\nlosing a dollar for the sake of one of our jolly old dinners,' laughed\nTom.\n\n'There's the turkey fattening for the feast. I never chase him now, but\nfeed him well; and he's \"swellin' wisibly\", bless his drumsticks!' said\nTed, pointing out the doomed fowl proudly parading in a neighbouring\nfield.\n\n'If Nat goes the last of the month we shall want a farewell frolic for\nhim. I suppose the dear old Chirper will come home a second Ole Bull,'\nsaid Nan to her friend.\n\nA pretty colour came into Daisy's cheek, and the folds of muslin on her\nbreast rose and fell with a quick breath; but she answered placidly:\n'Uncle Laurie says he has real talent, and after the training he will\nget abroad he can command a good living here, though he may never be\nfamous.'\n\n'Young people seldom turn out as one predicts, so it is of little use\nto expect anything,' said Mrs Meg with a sigh. 'If our children are good\nand useful men and women, we should be satisfied; yet it's very natural\nto wish them to be brilliant and successful.'\n\n'They are like my chickens, mighty uncertain. Now, that fine-looking\ncockerel of mine is the stupidest one of the lot, and the ugly,\nlong-legged chap is the king of the yard, he's so smart; crows loud\nenough to wake the Seven Sleepers; but the handsome one croaks, and is\nno end of a coward. I get snubbed; but you wait till I grow up, and\nthen see'; and Ted looked so like his own long-legged pet that everyone\nlaughed at his modest prediction.\n\n'I want to see Dan settled somewhere. \"A rolling stone gathers no moss\",\nand at twenty-five he is still roaming about the world without a tie to\nhold him, except this'; and Mrs Meg nodded towards her sister.\n\n'Dan will find his place at last, and experience is his best teacher.\nHe is rough still, but each time he comes home I see a change for the\nbetter, and never lose my faith in him. He may never do anything great,\nor get rich; but if the wild boy makes an honest man, I'm satisfied,'\nsaid Mrs Jo, who always defended the black sheep of her flock.\n\n'That's right, mother, stand by Dan! He's worth a dozen Jacks and Neds\nbragging about money and trying to be swells. You see if he doesn't do\nsomething to be proud of and take the wind out of their sails,'\nadded Ted, whose love for his 'Danny' was now strengthened by a boy's\nadmiration for the bold, adventurous man.\n\n'Hope so, I'm sure. He's just the fellow to do rash things and come\nto glory--climbing the Matterhorn, taking a \"header\" into Niagara, or\nfinding a big nugget. That's his way of sowing wild oats, and perhaps\nit's better than ours,' said Tom thoughtfully; for he had gained a good\ndeal of experience in that sort of agriculture since he became a medical\nstudent.\n\n'Much better!' said Mrs Jo emphatically. 'I'd rather send my boys off\nto see the world in that way than leave them alone in a city full of\ntemptations, with nothing to do but waste time, money, and health, as\nso many are left. Dan has to work his way, and that teaches him courage,\npatience, and self-reliance. I don't worry about him as much as I do\nabout George and Dolly at college, no more fit than two babies to take\ncare of themselves.'\n\n'How about John? He's knocking round town as a newspaper man, reporting\nall sorts of things, from sermons to prize-fights,' asked Tom, who\nthought that sort of life would be much more to his own taste than\nmedical lectures and hospital wards.\n\n'Demi has three safeguards--good principles, refined tastes, and a wise\nmother. He won't come to harm, and these experiences will be useful to\nhim when he begins to write, as I'm sure he will in time,' began Mrs\nJo in her prophetic tone; for she was anxious to have some of her geese\nturn out swans.\n\n'Speak of Jenkins, and you'll hear the rustling of his paper,' cried\nTom, as a fresh-faced, brown-eyed young man came up the avenue, waving a\nnewspaper over his head.\n\n'Here's your Evening Tattler! Latest Edition! Awful murder! Bank clerk\nabsconded! Powder-mill explosion, and great strike of the Latin School\nboys!' roared Ted, going to meet his cousin with the graceful gait of a\nyoung giraffe.\n\n'The Commodore is in, and will cut his cable and run before the wind\nas soon as he can get off,' called Demi, with 'a nice derangement of\nnautical epitaphs', as he came up smiling over his good news.\n\nEveryone talked together for a moment, and the paper passed from hand to\nhand that each eye might rest on the pleasant fact that the Brenda, from\nHamburg, was safe in port.\n\n'He'll come lurching out by tomorrow with his usual collection of marine\nmonsters and lively yarns. I saw him, jolly and tarry and brown as a\ncoffee-berry. Had a good run, and hopes to be second mate, as the other\nchap is laid up with a broken leg,' added Demi.\n\n'Wish I had the setting of it,' said Nan to herself, with a professional\ntwist of her hand.\n\n'How's Franz?' asked Mrs Jo.\n\n'He's going to be married! There's news for you. The first of the\nflock, Aunty, so say good-bye to him. Her name is Ludmilla Heldegard\nBlumenthal; good family, well-off, pretty, and of course an angel. The\ndear old boy wants Uncle's consent, and then he will settle down to be a\nhappy and an honest burgher. Long life to him!'\n\n'I'm glad to hear it. I do so like to settle my boys with a good wife\nand a nice little home. Now, if all is right, I shall feel as if Franz\nwas off my mind,' said Mrs Jo, folding her hands contentedly; for she\noften felt like a distracted hen with a large brood of mixed chickens\nand ducks upon her hands.\n\n'So do I,' sighed Tom, with a sly glance at Nan. 'That's what a fellow\nneeds to keep him steady; and it's the duty of nice girls to marry as\nsoon as possible, isn't it, Demi?'\n\n'If there are enough nice fellows to go round. The female population\nexceeds the male, you know, especially in New England; which accounts\nfor the high state of culture we are in, perhaps,' answered John, who\nwas leaning over his mother's chair, telling his day's experiences in a\nwhisper.\n\n'It is a merciful provision, my dears; for it takes three or four women\nto get each man into, through, and out of the world. You are costly\ncreatures, boys; and it is well that mothers, sisters, wives, and\ndaughters love their duty and do it so well, or you would perish off the\nface of the earth,' said Mrs Jo solemnly, as she took up a basket filled\nwith dilapidated hose; for the good Professor was still hard on his\nsocks, and his sons resembled him in that respect.\n\n'Such being the case, there is plenty for the \"superfluous women\" to do,\nin taking care of these helpless men and their families. I see that more\nclearly every day, and am very glad and grateful that my profession will\nmake me a useful, happy, and independent spinster.'\n\nNan's emphasis on the last word caused Tom to groan, and the rest to\nlaugh.\n\n'I take great pride and solid satisfaction in you, Nan, and hope to\nsee you very successful; for we do need just such helpful women in the\nworld. I sometimes feel as if I've missed my vocation and ought to\nhave remained single; but my duty seemed to point this way, and I don't\nregret it,' said Mrs Jo, folding a large and very ragged blue sock to\nher bosom.\n\n'Neither do I. What should I ever have done without my dearest Mum?'\nadded Ted, with a filial hug which caused both to disappear behind the\nnewspaper in which he had been mercifully absorbed for a few minutes.\n\n'My darling boy, if you would wash your hands semi-occasionally, fond\ncaresses would be less disastrous to my collar. Never mind, my precious\ntouslehead, better grass stains and dirt than no cuddlings at all'; and\nMrs Jo emerged from that brief eclipse looking much refreshed, though\nher back hair was caught in Ted's buttons and her collar under one ear.\n\nHere Josie, who had been studying her part at the other end of the\npiazza, suddenly burst forth with a smothered shriek, and gave Juliet's\nspeech in the tomb so effectively that the boys applauded, Daisy\nshivered, and Nan murmured: 'Too much cerebral excitement for one of her\nage.'\n\n'I'm afraid you'll have to make up your mind to it, Meg. That child is\na born actress. We never did anything so well, not even the Witch's\nCurse,' said Mrs Jo, casting a bouquet of many-coloured socks at the\nfeet of her flushed and panting niece, when she fell gracefully upon the\ndoor-mat.\n\n'It is a sort of judgement upon me for my passion for the stage when a\ngirl. Now I know how dear Marmee felt when I begged to be an actress. I\nnever can consent, and yet I may be obliged to give up my wishes, hopes,\nand plans again.'\n\nThere was an accent of reproach in his mother's voice, which made Demi\npick up his sister with a gentle shake, and the stern command to 'drop\nthat nonsense in public'.\n\n'Drop me, Minion, or I'll give you the Maniac Bride, with my best\nHa-ha!' cried Josie, glaring at him like an offended kitten. Being set\non her feet, she made a splendid courtesy, and dramatically proclaiming,\n'Mrs Woffington's carriage waits,' swept down the steps and round the\ncorner, trailing Daisy's scarlet shawl majestically behind her.\n\n'Isn't she great fun? I couldn't stop in this dull place if I hadn't\nthat child to make it lively for me. If ever she turns prim, I'm off; so\nmind how you nip her in the bud,' said Teddy, frowning at Demi, who was\nnow writing out shorthand notes on the steps.\n\n'You two are a team, and it takes a strong hand to drive you, but I\nrather like it. Josie ought to have been my child, and Rob yours, Meg.\nThen your house would have been all peace and mine all Bedlam. Now I\nmust go and tell Laurie the news. Come with me, Meg, a little stroll\nwill do us good'; and sticking Ted's straw hat on her head, Mrs Jo\nwalked off with her sister, leaving Daisy to attend to the muffins, Ted\nto appease Josie, and Tom and Nan to give their respective patients a\nvery bad quarter of an hour.\n\n\n\nChapter 2. PARNASSUS\n\nIt was well named; and the Muses seemed to be at home that day, for as\nthe newcomers went up the slope appropriate sights and sounds greeted\nthem. Passing an open window, they looked in upon a library presided\nover by Clio, Calliope, and Urania; Melpomene and Thalia were disporting\nthemselves in the hall, where some young people were dancing and\nrehearsing a play; Erato was walking in the garden with her lover, and\nin the music-room Phoebus himself was drilling a tuneful choir.\n\nA mature Apollo was our old friend Laurie, but comely and genial as\never; for time had ripened the freakish boy into a noble man. Care and\nsorrow, as well as ease and happiness, had done much for him; and the\nresponsibility of carrying out his grandfather's wishes had been a\nduty most faithfully performed. Prosperity suits some people, and they\nblossom best in a glow of sunshine; others need the shade, and are the\nsweeter for a touch of frost. Laurie was one of the former sort, and\nAmy was another; so life had been a kind of poem to them since they\nmarried--not only harmonious and happy, but earnest, useful, and rich in\nthe beautiful benevolence which can do so much when wealth and wisdom go\nhand in hand with charity. Their house was full of unostentatious beauty\nand comfort, and here the art-loving host and hostess attracted and\nentertained artists of all kinds. Laurie had music enough now, and was a\ngenerous patron to the class he most liked to help. Amy had her proteges\namong ambitious young painters and sculptors, and found her own art\ndouble dear as her daughter grew old enough to share its labours and\ndelights with her; for she was one of those who prove that women can be\nfaithful wives and mothers without sacrificing the special gift bestowed\nupon them for their own development and the good of others.\n\nHer sisters knew where to find her, and Jo went at once to the studio,\nwhere mother and daughter worked together. Bess was busy with the bust\nof a little child, while her mother added the last touches to a fine\nhead of her husband. Time seemed to have stood still with Amy, for\nhappiness had kept her young and prosperity given her the culture she\nneeded. A stately, graceful woman, who showed how elegant simplicity\ncould be made by the taste with which she chose her dress and the grace\nwith which she wore it. As someone said: 'I never know what Mrs Laurence\nhas on, but I always receive the impression that she is the best-dressed\nlady in the room.'\n\nIt was evident that she adored her daughter, and well she might; for\nthe beauty she had longed for seemed, to her fond eyes at least, to\nbe impersonated in this younger self. Bess inherited her mother's\nDiana-like figure, blue eyes, fair skin, and golden hair, tied up in\nthe same classic knot of curls. Also--ah! never-ending source of joy to\nAmy--she had her father's handsome nose and mouth, cast in a feminine\nmould. The severe simplicity of a long linen pinafore suited her;\nand she worked away with the entire absorption of the true artist,\nunconscious of the loving eyes upon her, till Aunt Jo came in exclaiming\neagerly:\n\n'My dear girls, stop your mud-pies and hear the news!'\n\nBoth artists dropped their tools and greeted the irrepressible woman\ncordially, though genius had been burning splendidly and her coming\nspoilt a precious hour. They were in the full tide of gossip when\nLaurie, who had been summoned by Meg, arrived, and sitting down between\nthe sisters, with no barricade anywhere, listened with interest to the\nnews of Franz and Emil.\n\n'The epidemic has broke out, and now it will rage and ravage your flock.\nBe prepared for every sort of romance and rashness for the next ten\nyears, Jo. Your boys are growing up and will plunge headlong into a sea\nof worse scrapes than any you have had yet,' said Laurie, enjoying her\nlook of mingled delight and despair.\n\n'I know it, and I hope I shall be able to pull them through and land\nthem safely; but it's an awful responsibility, for they will come to me\nand insist that I can make their poor little loves run smoothly. I\nlike it, though, and Meg is such a mush of sentiment she revels in the\nprospect,' answered Jo, feeling pretty easy about her own boys, whose\nyouth made them safe for the present.\n\n'I'm afraid she won't revel when our Nat begins to buzz too near her\nDaisy. Of course you see what all that means? As musical director I am\nalso his confidante, and would like to know what advice to give,' said\nLaurie soberly. 'Hush! you forget that child,' began Jo, nodding towards\nBess, who was at work again.\n\n'Bless you! she's in Athens, and doesn't hear a word. She ought to leave\noff, though, and go out. My darling, put the baby to sleep, and go for\na run. Aunt Meg is in the parlour; go and show her the new pictures till\nwe come,' added Laurie, looking at his tall girl as Pygmalion might have\nlooked at Galatea; for he considered her the finest statue in the house.\n\n'Yes, papa; but please tell me if it is good'; and Bess obediently put\ndown her tools, with a lingering glance at the bust.\n\n'My cherished daughter, truth compels me to confess that one cheek is\nplumper than the other; and the curls upon its infant brow are rather\ntoo much like horns for perfect grace; otherwise it rivals Raphael's\nChanting Cherubs, and I'm proud of it.'\n\nLaurie was laughing as he spoke; for these first attempts were so like\nAmy's early ones, it was impossible to regard them as soberly as the\nenthusiastic mamma did.\n\n'You can't see beauty in anything but music,' answered Bess, shaking the\ngolden head that made the one bright spot in the cool north lights of\nthe great studio.\n\n'Well, I see beauty in you, dear. And if you are not art, what is? I\nwish to put a little more nature into you, and get you away from this\ncold clay and marble into the sunshine, to dance and laugh as the\nothers do. I want a flesh-and-blood girl, not a sweet statue in a grey\npinafore, who forgets everything but her work.' As he spoke, two dusty\nhands came round his neck, and Bess said earnestly, punctuating her\nwords with soft touches of her lips:\n\n'I never forget you, papa; but I do want to do something beautiful that\nyou may be proud of me by and by. Mamma often tells me to stop; but when\nwe get in here we forget there is any world outside, we are so busy and\nso happy. Now I'll go and run and sing, and be a girl to please you.'\nAnd throwing away the apron, Bess vanished from the room, seeming to\ntake all the light with her.\n\n'I'm glad you said that. The dear child is too much absorbed in her\nartistic dreams for one so young. It is my fault; but I sympathize so\ndeeply in it all, I forget to be wise,' sighed Amy, carefully covering\nthe baby with a wet towel.\n\n'I think this power of living in our children is one of the sweetest\nthings in the world; but I try to remember what Marmee once said to\nMeg--that fathers should have their share in the education of both girls\nand boys; so I leave Ted to his father all I can, and Fritz lends me\nRob, whose quiet ways are as restful and good for me as Ted's tempests\nare for his father. Now I advise you, Amy, to let Bess drop the mud-pies\nfor a time, and take up music with Laurie; then she won't be one-sided,\nand he won't be jealous.'\n\n'Hear, hear! A Daniel--a very Daniel!' cried Laurie, well pleased. 'I\nthought you'd lend a hand, Jo, and say a word for me. I am a little\njealous of Amy, and want more of a share in my girl. Come, my lady, let\nme have her this summer, and next year, when we go to Rome, I'll give\nher up to you and high art. Isn't that a fair bargain?'\n\n'I agree; but in trying your hobby, nature, with music thrown in, don't\nforget that, though only fifteen, our Bess is older than most girls of\nthat age, and cannot be treated like a child. She is so very precious\nto me, I feel as if I wanted to keep her always as pure and beautiful as\nthe marble she loves so well.'\n\nAmy spoke regretfully as she looked about the lovely room where she had\nspent so many happy hours with this dear child of hers.\n\n'\"Turn and turn about is fair play\", as we used to say when we all\nwanted to ride on Ellen Tree or wear the russet boots,' said Jo briskly;\n'so you must share your girl between you, and see who will do the most\nfor her.'\n\n'We will,' answered the fond parents, laughing at the recollections Jo's\nproverb brought up to them.\n\n'How I did use to enjoy bouncing on the limbs of that old apple-tree!\nNo real horse ever gave me half the pleasure or the exercise,' said Amy,\nlooking out of the high window as if she saw the dear old orchard again\nand the little girls at play there.\n\n'And what fun I had with those blessed boots!' laughed Jo. 'I've got the\nrelics now. The boys reduced them to rags; but I love them still, and\nwould enjoy a good theatrical stalk in them if it were possible.'\n\n'My fondest memories twine about the warming-pan and the sausage. What\nlarks we had! And how long ago it seems!' said Laurie, staring at the\ntwo women before him as if he found it hard to realize that they ever\nhad been little Amy and riotous Jo.\n\n'Don't suggest that we are growing old, my Lord. We have only bloomed;\nand a very nice bouquet we make with our buds about us,' answered Mrs\nAmy, shaking out the folds of her rosy muslin with much the air of\ndainty satisfaction the girl used to show in a new dress.\n\n'Not to mention our thorns and dead leaves,' added Jo, with a sigh; for\nlife had never been very easy to her, and even now she had her troubles\nboth within and without.\n\n'Come and have a dish of tea, old dear, and see what the young folks are\nabout. You are tired, and want to be \"stayed with flagons and comforted\nwith apples\",' said Laurie, offering an arm to each sister, and leading\nthem away to afternoon tea, which flowed as freely on Parnassus as the\nnectar of old.\n\nThey found Meg in the summer-parlour, an airy and delightful room, full\nnow of afternoon sunshine and the rustle of trees; for the three long\nwindows opened on the garden. The great music-room was at one end,\nand at the other, in a deep alcove hung with purple curtains, a little\nhousehold shrine had been made. Three portraits hung there, two marble\nbusts stood in the corners, and a couch, an oval table, with its urn\nof flowers, were the only articles of furniture the nook contained. The\nbusts were John Brooke and Beth--Amy's work--both excellent likenesses,\nand both full of the placid beauty which always recalls the saying,\nthat 'Clay represents life; plaster, death; marble, immortality'. On\nthe right, as became the founder of the house, hung the portrait of Mr\nLaurence, with its expression of mingled pride and benevolence, as fresh\nand attractive as when he caught the girl Jo admiring it. Opposite was\nAunt March--a legacy to Amy--in an imposing turban, immense sleeves, and\nlong mittens decorously crossed on the front of her plum-coloured satin\ngown. Time had mellowed the severity of her aspect; and the fixed regard\nof the handsome old gentleman opposite seemed to account for the amiable\nsimper on lips that had not uttered a sharp word for years.\n\nIn the place of honour, with the sunshine warm upon it, and a green\ngarland always round it, was Marmee's beloved face, painted with\ngrateful skill by a great artist whom she had befriended when poor and\nunknown. So beautifully lifelike was it that it seemed to smile down\nupon her daughters, saying cheerfully:\n\n'Be happy; I am with you still.'\n\nThe three sisters stood a moment looking up at the beloved picture with\neyes full of tender reverence and the longing that never left them; for\nthis noble mother had been so much to them that no one could ever fill\nher place. Only two years since she had gone away to live and love anew,\nleaving such a sweet memory behind her that it was both an inspiration\nand a comforter to all the household. They felt this as they drew closer\nto one another, and Laurie put it into words as he said earnestly:\n\n'I can ask nothing better for my child than that she may be a woman like\nour mother. Please God, she shall be, if I can do it; for I owe the best\nI have to this dear saint.'\n\nJust then a fresh voice began to sing 'Ave Maria' in the music-room, and\nBess unconsciously echoed her father's prayer for her as she dutifully\nobeyed his wishes. The soft sound of the air Marmee used to sing led the\nlisteners back into the world again from that momentary reaching after\nthe loved and lost, and they sat down together near the open windows\nenjoying the music, while Laurie brought them tea, making the little\nservice pleasant by the tender care he gave to it.\n\nNat came in with Demi, soon followed by Ted and Josie, the Professor and\nhis faithful Rob, all anxious to hear more about 'the boys'. The rattle\nof cups and tongues grew brisk, and the setting sun saw a cheerful\ncompany resting in the bright room after the varied labours of the day.\n\nProfessor Bhaer was grey now, but robust and genial as ever; for he had\nthe work he loved, and did it so heartily that the whole college felt\nhis beautiful influence. Rob was as much like him as it was possible for\na boy to be, and was already called the 'young Professor', he so adored\nstudy and closely imitated his honoured father in all ways.\n\n'Well, heart's dearest, we go to have our boys again, all two, and\nmay rejoice greatly,' said Mr Bhaer, seating himself beside Jo with a\nbeaming face and a handshake of congratulation.\n\n'Oh, Fritz, I'm so delighted about Emil, and if you approve about Franz\nalso. Did you know Ludmilla? Is it a wise match?' asked Mrs Jo, handing\nhim her cup of tea and drawing closer, as if she welcomed her refuge in\njoy as well as sorrow.\n\n'It all goes well. I saw the Madchen when I went over to place Franz.\nA child then, but most sweet and charming. Blumenthal is satisfied, I\nthink, and the boy will be happy. He is too German to be content away\nfrom Vaterland, so we shall have him as a link between the new and the\nold, and that pleases me much.'\n\n'And Emil, he is to be second mate next voyage; isn't that fine? I'm so\nhappy that both your boys have done well; you gave up so much for them\nand their mother. You make light of it, dear, but I never forget it,'\nsaid Jo, with her hand in his as sentimentally as if she was a girl\nagain and her Fritz had come a-wooing.\n\nHe laughed his cheery laugh, and whispered behind her fan: 'If I had not\ncome to America for the poor lads, I never should have found my Jo.\nThe hard times are very sweet now, and I bless Gott for all I seemed to\nlose, because I gained the blessing of my life.'\n\n'Spooning! spooning! Here's an awful flirtation on the sly,' cried\nTeddy, peering over the fan just at that interesting moment, much to his\nmother's confusion and his father's amusement; for the Professor never\nwas ashamed of the fact that he still considered his wife the dearest\nwoman in the world. Rob promptly ejected his brother from one window,\nto see him skip in at the other, while Mrs Jo shut her fan and held it\nready to rap her unruly boy's knuckles if he came near her again.\n\nNat approached in answer to Mr Bhaer's beckoning teaspoon, and stood\nbefore them with a face full of the respectful affection he felt for the\nexcellent man who had done so much for him.\n\n'I have the letters ready for thee, my son. They are two old friends of\nmine in Leipzig, who will befriend thee in that new life. It is well to\nhave them, for thou wilt be heartbroken with Heimweh at the first, Nat,\nand need comforting,' said the Professor, giving him several letters.\n\n'Thanks, sir. Yes, I expect to be pretty lonely till I get started, then\nmy music and the hope of getting on will cheer me up,' answered Nat, who\nboth longed and dreaded to leave all these friends behind him and make\nnew ones.\n\nHe was a man now; but the blue eyes were as honest as ever, the mouth\nstill a little weak, in spite of the carefully cherished moustache\nover it, and the broad forehead more plainly than ever betrayed the\nmusic-loving nature of the youth. Modest, affectionate, and dutiful, Nat\nwas considered a pleasant though not a brilliant success by Mrs Jo. She\nloved and trusted him, and was sure he would do his best, but did not\nexpect that he would be great in any way, unless the stimulus of foreign\ntraining and self-dependence made him a better artist and a stronger man\nthan now seemed likely.\n\n'I've marked all your things--or rather, Daisy did--and as soon as your\nbooks are collected, we can see about the packing,' said Mrs Jo, who was\nso used to fitting boys off for all quarters of the globe that a trip to\nthe North Pole would not have been too much for her.\n\nNat grew red at mention of that name--or was it the last glow of sunset\non his rather pale cheek?--and his heart beat happily at the thought of\nthe dear girl working Ns and Bs on his humble socks and handkerchiefs;\nfor Nat adored Daisy, and the cherished dream of his life was to earn\na place for himself as a musician and win this angel for his wife. This\nhope did more for him than the Professor's counsels, Mrs Jo's care, or\nMr Laurie's generous help. For her sake he worked, waited, and hoped,\nfinding courage and patience in the dream of that happy future when\nDaisy should make a little home for him and he fiddle a fortune into her\nlap. Mrs Jo knew this; and though he was not exactly the man she would\nhave chosen for her niece, she felt that Nat would always need just the\nwise and loving care Daisy could give him, and that without it there was\ndanger of his being one of the amiable and aimless men who fail for\nwant of the right pilot to steer them safely through the world. Mrs Meg\ndecidedly frowned upon the poor boy's love, and would not hear of giving\nher dear girl to any but the best man to be found on the face of the\nearth. She was very kind, but as firm as such gentle souls can be; and\nNat fled for comfort to Mrs Jo, who always espoused the interests of\nher boys heartily. A new set of anxieties was beginning now that the\naforesaid boys were growing up, and she foresaw no end of worry as well\nas amusement in the love-affairs already budding in her flock. Mrs Meg\nwas usually her best ally and adviser, for she loved romances as well\nnow as when a blooming girl herself. But in this case she hardened her\nheart, and would not hear a word of entreaty. 'Nat was not man enough,\nnever would be, no one knew his family, a musician's life was a hard\none; Daisy was too young, five or six years hence when time had proved\nboth perhaps. Let us see what absence will do for him.' And that was the\nend of it, for when the maternal Pelican was roused she could be very\nfirm, though for her precious children she would have plucked her last\nfeather and given the last drop of her blood.\n\nMrs Jo was thinking of this as she looked at Nat while he talked\nwith her husband about Leipzig, and she resolved to have a clear\nunderstanding with him before he went; for she was used to confidences,\nand talked freely with her boys about the trials and temptations that\nbeset all lives in the beginning, and so often mar them, for want of the\nright word at the right moment.\n\nThis is the first duty of parents, and no false delicacy should\nkeep them from the watchful care, the gentle warning, which makes\nself-knowledge and self-control the compass and pilot of the young as\nthey leave the safe harbour of home.\n\n'Plato and his disciples approach,' announced irreverent Teddy, as Mr\nMarch came in with several young men and women about him; for the wise\nold man was universally beloved, and ministered so beautifully to his\nflock that many of them thanked him all their lives for the help given\nto both hearts and souls.\n\nBess went to him at once; for since Marmee died, Grandpapa was her\nspecial care, and it was sweet to see the golden head bend over the\nsilver one as she rolled out his easy-chair and waited on him with\ntender alacrity.\n\n'Aesthetic tea always on tap here, sir; will you have a flowing bowl\nor a bit of ambrosia?' asked Laurie, who was wandering about with a\nsugar-basin in one hand and a plate of cake in the other; for sweetening\ncups and feeding the hungry was work he loved.\n\n'Neither, thanks; this child has taken care of me'; and Mr March turned\nto Bess, who sat on one arm of his chair, holding a glass of fresh milk.\n\n'Long may she live to do it, sir, and I be here to see this pretty\ncontradiction of the song that \"youth and age cannot live together\"!'\nanswered Laurie, smiling at the pair. '\"Crabbed age\", papa; that makes\nall the difference in the world,' said Bess quickly; for she loved\npoetry, and read the best.\n\n    'Wouldst thou see fresh roses grow\n     In a reverend bed of snow?'\n\nquoted Mr March, as Josie came and perched on the other arm, looking\nlike a very thorny little rose; for she had been having a hot discussion\nwith Ted, and had got the worst of it.\n\n'Grandpa, must women always obey men and say they are the wisest, just\nbecause they are the strongest?' she cried, looking fiercely at her\ncousin, who came stalking up with a provoking smile on the boyish face\nthat was always very comical atop of that tall figure.\n\n'Well, my dear, that is the old-fashioned belief, and it will take some\ntime to change it. But I think the woman's hour has struck; and it looks\nto me as if the boys must do their best, for the girls are abreast\nnow, and may reach the goal first,' answered Mr March, surveying with\npaternal satisfaction the bright faces of the young women, who were\namong the best students in the college.\n\n'The poor little Atalantas are sadly distracted and delayed by the\nobstacles thrown in their way--not golden apples, by any means--but\nI think they will stand a fair chance when they have learned to run\nbetter,' laughed Uncle Laurie, stroking Josie's breezy hair, which stood\nup like the fur of an angry kitten.\n\n'Whole barrels of apples won't stop me when I start, and a dozen Teds\nwon't trip me up, though they may try. I'll show him that a woman can\nact as well, if not better, than a man. It has been done, and will be\nagain; and I'll never own that my brain isn't as good as his, though it\nmay be smaller,' cried the excited young person.\n\n'If you shake your head in that violent way you'll addle what brains you\nhave got; and I'd take care of 'em, if I were you,' began teasing Ted.\n\n'What started this civil war?' asked Grandpapa, with a gentle emphasis\non the adjective, which caused the combatants to calm their ardour a\nlittle.\n\n'Why, we were pegging away at the Iliad and came to where Zeus tells\nJuno not to inquire into his plans or he'll whip her, and Jo was\ndisgusted because Juno meekly hushed up. I said it was all right, and\nagreed with the old fellow that women didn't know much and ought to obey\nmen,' explained Ted, to the great amusement of his hearers.\n\n'Goddesses may do as they like, but those Greek and Trojan women were\npoor-spirited things if they minded men who couldn't fight their own\nbattles and had to be hustled off by Pallas, and Venus, and Juno, when\nthey were going to get beaten. The idea of two armies stopping and\nsitting down while a pair of heroes flung stones at one another! I don't\nthink much of your old Homer. Give me Napoleon or Grant for my hero.'\n\nJosie's scorn was as funny as if a humming-bird scolded at an ostrich,\nand everyone laughed as she sniffed at the immortal poet and criticized\nthe gods.\n\n'Napoleon's Juno had a nice time; didn't she? That's just the way girls\nargue--first one way and then the other,' jeered Ted.\n\n'Like Johnson's young lady, who was \"not categorical, but all\nwiggle-waggle\",' added Uncle Laurie, enjoying the battle immensely.\n\n'I was only speaking of them as soldiers. But if you come to the woman\nside of it, wasn't Grant a kind husband and Mrs Grant a happy woman?\nHe didn't threaten to whip her if she asked a natural question; and if\nNapoleon did do wrong about Josephine, he could fight, and didn't want\nany Minerva to come fussing over him. They were a stupid set, from\ndandified Paris to Achilles sulking in his ships, and I won't change my\nopinion for all the Hectors and Agamemnons in Greece,' said Josie, still\nunconquered.\n\n'You can fight like a Trojan, that's evident; and we will be the two\nobedient armies looking on while you and Ted have it out,' began Uncle\nLaurie, assuming the attitude of a warrior leaning on his spear.\n\n'I fear we must give it up, for Pallas is about to descend and carry off\nour Hector,' said Mr March, smiling, as Jo came to remind her son that\nsuppertime was near.\n\n'We will fight it out later when there are no goddesses to interfere,'\nsaid Teddy, as he turned away with unusual alacrity, remembering the\ntreat in store.\n\n'Conquered by a muffin, by Jove!' called Josie after him, exulting in an\nopportunity to use the classical exclamation forbidden to her sex.\n\nBut Ted shot a Parthian arrow as he retired in good order by replying,\nwith a highly virtuous expression:\n\n'Obedience is a soldier's first duty.'\n\nBent on her woman's privilege of having the last word, Josie ran after\nhim, but never uttered the scathing speech upon her lips, for a very\nbrown young man in a blue suit came leaping up the steps with a cheery\n'Ahoy! ahoy! where is everybody?'\n\n'Emil! Emil!' cried Josie, and in a moment Ted was upon him, and the\nlate enemies ended their fray in a joyful welcome to the newcomer.\n\nMuffins were forgotten, and towing their cousin like two fussy little\ntugs with a fine merchantman, the children returned to the parlour,\nwhere Emil kissed all the women and shook hands with all the men except\nhis uncle; him he embraced in the good old German style, to the great\ndelight of the observers.\n\n'Didn't think I could get off today, but found I could, and steered\nstraight for old Plum. Not a soul there, so I luffed and bore away for\nParnassus, and here is every man Jack of you. Bless your hearts, how\nglad I am to see you all!' exclaimed the sailor boy, beaming at them, as\nhe stood with his legs apart as if he still felt the rocking deck under\nhis feet.\n\n'You ought to \"shiver your timbers\", not \"bless our hearts\", Emil; it's\nnot nautical at all. Oh, how nice and shippy and tarry you do smell!'\nsaid Josie, sniffing at him with great enjoyment of the fresh sea odours\nhe brought with him. This was her favourite cousin, and she was his\npet; so she knew that the bulging pockets of the blue jacket contained\ntreasures for her at least.\n\n'Avast, my hearty, and let me take soundings before you dive,' laughed\nEmil, understanding her affectionate caresses, and holding her off with\none hand while with the other he rummaged out sundry foreign little\nboxes and parcels marked with different names, and handed them round\nwith appropriate remarks, which caused much laughter; for Emil was a\nwag.\n\n'There's a hawser that will hold our little cock-boat still about five\nminutes,' he said, throwing a necklace of pretty pink coral over Josie's\nhead; 'and here's something the mermaids sent to Undine,' he added,\nhanding Bess a string of pearly shells on a silver chain.\n\nI thought Daisy would like a fiddle, and Nat can find her a beau,'\ncontinued the sailor, with a laugh, as he undid a dainty filigree brooch\nin the shape of a violin.\n\n'I know she will, and I'll take it to her,' answered Nat, as he\nvanished, glad of an errand, and sure that he could find Daisy though\nEmil had missed her.\n\nEmil chuckled, and handed out a quaintly carved bear whose head opened,\nshowing a capacious ink-stand. This he presented, with a scrape, to Aunt\nJo.\n\n'Knowing your fondness for these fine animals, I brought this one to\nyour pen.'\n\n'Very good, Commodore! Try again,' said Mrs Jo, much pleased with her\ngift, which caused the Professor to prophesy 'works of Shakespeare' from\nits depths, so great would be the inspiration of the beloved bruin.\n\n'As Aunt Meg will wear caps, in spite of her youth, I got Ludmilla to\nget me some bits of lace. Hope you'll like 'em'; and out of a soft paper\ncame some filmy things, one of which soon lay like a net of snowflakes\non Mrs Meg's pretty hair.\n\n'I couldn't find anything swell enough for Aunt Amy, because she has\neverything she wants, so I brought a little picture that always makes\nme think of her when Bess was a baby'; and he handed her an oval ivory\nlocket, on which was painted a goldenhaired Madonna, with a rosy child\nfolded in her blue mantle.\n\n'How lovely!' cried everyone; and Aunt Amy at once hung it about her\nneck on the blue ribbon from Bess's hair, charmed with her gift; for it\nrecalled the happiest year of her life.\n\n'Now, I flatter myself I've got just the thing for Nan, neat but not\ngaudy, a sort of sign you see, and very appropriate for a doctor,' said\nEmil, proudly displaying a pair of lava earrings shaped like little\nskulls.\n\n'Horrid!' And Bess, who hated ugly things, turned her eyes to her own\npretty shells.\n\n'She won't wear earrings,' said Josie.\n\n'Well, she'll enjoy punching your ears then. She's never so happy as\nwhen she's overhauling her fellow creatures and going for 'em with a\nknife,' answered Emil, undisturbed. 'I've got a lot of plunder for you\nfellows in my chest, but I knew I should have no peace till my cargo for\nthe girls was unloaded. Now tell me all the news.' And, seated on Amy's\nbest marbletopped table, the sailor swung his legs and talked at the\nrate of ten knots an hour, till Aunt Jo carried them all off to a grand\nfamily tea in honour of the Commodore.\n\n\n\nChapter 3. JO'S LAST SCRAPE\n\nThe March family had enjoyed a great many surprises in the course of\ntheir varied career, but the greatest of all was when the Ugly Duckling\nturned out to be, not a swan, but a golden goose, whose literary eggs\nfound such an unexpected market that in ten years Jo's wildest and most\ncherished dream actually came true. How or why it happened she never\nclearly understood, but all of a sudden she found herself famous in a\nsmall way, and, better still, with a snug little fortune in her pocket\nto clear away the obstacles of the present and assure the future of her\nboys.\n\nIt began during a bad year when everything went wrong at Plumfield;\ntimes were hard, the school dwindled, Jo overworked herself and had a\nlong illness; Laurie and Amy were abroad, and the Bhaers too proud to\nask help even of those as near and dear as this generous pair. Confined\nto her room, Jo got desperate over the state of affairs, till she fell\nback upon the long-disused pen as the only thing she could do to help\nfill up the gaps in the income. A book for girls being wanted by a\ncertain publisher, she hastily scribbled a little story describing a few\nscenes and adventures in the lives of herself and sisters, though boys\nwere more in her line, and with very slight hopes of success sent it out\nto seek its fortune.\n\nThings always went by contraries with Jo. Her first book, laboured over\nfor years, and launched full of the high hopes and ambitious dreams of\nyouth, foundered on its voyage, though the wreck continued to float long\nafterward, to the profit of the publisher at least. The hastily written\nstory, sent away with no thought beyond the few dollars it might bring,\nsailed with a fair wind and a wise pilot at the helm into public favour,\nand came home heavily laden with an unexpected cargo of gold and glory.\n\nA more astonished woman probably never existed than Josephine Bhaer when\nher little ship came into port with flags flying, cannon that had been\nsilent before now booming gaily, and, better than all, many kind faces\nrejoicing with her, many friendly hands grasping hers with cordial\ncongratulations. After that it was plain sailing, and she merely had\nto load her ships and send them off on prosperous trips, to bring home\nstores of comfort for all she loved and laboured for.\n\nThe fame she never did quite accept; for it takes very little fire to\nmake a great deal of smoke nowadays, and notoriety is not real glory.\nThe fortune she could not doubt, and gratefully received; though it was\nnot half so large a one as a generous world reported it to be. The tide\nhaving turned continued to rise, and floated the family comfortably into\na snug harbour where the older members could rest secure from storms,\nand whence the younger ones could launch their boats for the voyage of\nlife.\n\nAll manner of happiness, peace, and plenty came in those years to bless\nthe patient waiters, hopeful workers, and devout believers in the wisdom\nand justice of Him who sends disappointment, poverty, and sorrow to try\nthe love of human hearts and make success the sweeter when it comes.\nThe world saw the prosperity, and kind souls rejoiced over the improved\nfortunes of the family; but the success Jo valued most, the happiness\nthat nothing could change or take away, few knew much about.\n\nIt was the power of making her mother's last years happy and serene; to\nsee the burden of care laid down for ever, the weary hands at rest, the\ndear face untroubled by any anxiety, and the tender heart free to pour\nitself out in the wise charity which was its delight. As a girl, Jo's\nfavourite plan had been a room where Marmee could sit in peace and enjoy\nherself after her hard, heroic life. Now the dream had become a happy\nfact, and Marmee sat in her pleasant chamber with every comfort and\nluxury about her, loving daughters to wait on her as infirmities\nincreased, a faithful mate to lean upon, and grand-children to brighten\nthe twilight of life with their dutiful affection. A very precious time\nto all, for she rejoiced as only mothers can in the good fortunes of\ntheir children. She had lived to reap the harvest she sowed; had seen\nprayers answered, hopes blossom, good gifts bear fruit, peace and\nprosperity bless the home she had made; and then, like some brave,\npatient angel, whose work was done, turned her face heavenward, glad to\nrest.\n\nThis was the sweet and sacred side of the change; but it had its droll\nand thorny one, as all things have in this curious world of ours. After\nthe first surprise, incredulity, and joy, which came to Jo, with the\ningratitude of human nature, she soon tired of renown, and began to\nresent her loss of liberty. For suddenly the admiring public took\npossession of her and all her affairs, past, present, and to come.\nStrangers demanded to look at her, question, advise, warn, congratulate,\nand drive her out of her wits by well-meant but very wearisome\nattentions. If she declined to open her heart to them, they reproached\nher; if she refused to endow her pet charities, relieve private wants,\nor sympathize with every ill and trial known to humanity, she was called\nhard-hearted, selfish, and haughty; if she found it impossible to answer\nthe piles of letters sent her, she was neglectful of her duty to\nthe admiring public; and if she preferred the privacy of home to the\npedestal upon which she was requested to pose, 'the airs of literary\npeople' were freely criticized.\n\nShe did her best for the children, they being the public for whom she\nwrote, and laboured stoutly to supply the demand always in the mouths of\nvoracious youth--'More stories; more right away!' Her family objected to\nthis devotion at their expense, and her health suffered; but for a time\nshe gratefully offered herself up on the altar of juvenile literature,\nfeeling that she owed a good deal to the little friends in whose sight\nshe had found favour after twenty years of effort.\n\nBut a time came when her patience gave out; and wearying of being a\nlion, she became a bear in nature as in name, and returning to her den,\ngrowled awfully when ordered out. Her family enjoyed the fun, and had\nsmall sympathy with her trials, but Jo came to consider it the worse\nscrape of her life; for liberty had always been her dearest possession,\nand it seemed to be fast going from her. Living in a lantern soon loses\nits charm, and she was too old, too tired, and too busy to like it. She\nfelt that she had done all that could reasonably be required of her when\nautographs, photographs, and autobiographical sketches had been sown\nbroadcast over the land; when artists had taken her home in all its\naspects, and reporters had taken her in the grim one she always\nassumed on these trying occasions; when a series of enthusiastic\nboarding-schools had ravaged her grounds for trophies, and a steady\nstream of amiable pilgrims had worn her doorsteps with their respectful\nfeet; when servants left after a week's trial of the bell that rang all\nday; when her husband was forced to guard her at meals, and the boys\nto cover her retreat out of back windows on certain occasions when\nenterprising guests walked in unannounced at unfortunate moments.\n\nA sketch of one day may perhaps explain the state of things, offer some\nexcuse for the unhappy woman, and give a hint to the autograph-fiend now\nrampant in the land; for it is a true tale.\n\n'There ought to be a law to protect unfortunate authors,' said Mrs Jo\none morning soon after Emil's arrival, when the mail brought her an\nunusually large and varied assortment of letters. 'To me it is a more\nvital subject than international copyright; for time is money, peace is\nhealth, and I lose both with no return but less respect for my fellow\ncreatures and a wild desire to fly into the wilderness, since I cannot\nshut my doors even in free America.'\n\n'Lion-hunters are awful when in search of their prey. If they could\nchange places for a while it would do them good; and they'd see what\nbores they were when they \"do themselves the honour of calling to\nexpress their admiration of our charming work\",' quoted Ted, with a bow\nto his parent, now frowning over twelve requests for autographs.\n\n'I have made up my mind on one point,' said Mrs Jo with great firmness.\n'I will not answer this kind of letter. I've sent at least six to this\nboy, and he probably sells them. This girl writes from a seminary, and\nif I send her one all the other girls will at once write for more. All\nbegin by saying they know they intrude, and that I am of course annoyed\nby these requests; but they venture to ask because I like boys, or they\nlike the books, or it is only one. Emerson and Whittier put these things\nin the wastepaper-basket; and though only a literary nursery-maid\nwho provides moral pap for the young, I will follow their illustrious\nexample; for I shall have no time to eat or sleep if I try to satisfy\nthese dear unreasonable children'; and Mrs Jo swept away the entire\nbatch with a sigh of relief.\n\n'I'll open the others and let you eat your breakfast in peace, liebe\nMutter,' said Rob, who often acted as her secretary. 'Here's one from\nthe South'; and breaking an imposing seal, he read:\n\n'MADAM, As it has pleased Heaven to bless your efforts with a large\nfortune, I feel no hesitation in asking you to supply funds to purchase\na new communion-service for our church. To whatever denomination you\nbelong, you will of course respond with liberality to such a request,\n\n'Respectfully yours,\n\n'MRS X.Y. ZAVIER'\n\n\n'Send a civil refusal, dear. All I have to give must go to feed and\nclothe the poor at my gates. That is my thank-offering for success. Go\non,' answered his mother, with a grateful glance about her happy home.\n\n'A literary youth of eighteen proposes that you put your name to a novel\nhe has written; and after the first edition your name is to be taken off\nand his put on. There's a cool proposal for you. I guess you won't agree\nto that, in spite of your soft-heartedness towards most of the young\nscribblers.'\n\n'Couldn't be done. Tell him so kindly, and don't let him send the\nmanuscript. I have seven on hand now, and barely time to read my own,'\nsaid Mrs Jo, pensively fishing a small letter out of the slop-bowl and\nopening it with care, because the down-hill address suggested that a\nchild wrote it.\n\n'I will answer this myself. A little sick girl wants a book, and she\nshall have it, but I can't write sequels to all the rest to please her.\nI should never come to an end if I tried to suit these voracious little\nOliver Twists, clamouring for more. What next, Robin?'\n\n'This is short and sweet.\n\n'DEAR MRS BHAER, I am now going to give you my opinion of your works.\nI have read them all many times, and call them first-rate. Please go\nahead.\n\n'Your admirer,\n\n'BILLY BABCOCK'\n\n\n\n'Now that is what I like. Billy is a man of sense and a critic worth\nhaving, since he had read my works many times before expressing his\nopinion. He asks for no answer, so send my thanks and regards.'\n\n'Here's a lady in England with seven girls, and she wishes to know your\nviews upon education. Also what careers they shall follow the oldest\nbeing twelve. Don't wonder she's worried,' laughed Rob.\n\n'I'll try to answer it. But as I have no girls, my opinion isn't worth\nmuch and will probably shock her, as I shall tell her to let them run\nand play and build up good, stout bodies before she talks about careers.\nThey will soon show what they want, if they are let alone, and not all\nrun in the same mould.'\n\n'Here's a fellow who wants to know what sort of a girl he shall marry,\nand if you know of any like those in your stories.'\n\n'Give him Nan's address, and see what he'll get,' proposed Ted,\nprivately resolving to do it himself if possible.\n\n'This is from a lady who wants you to adopt her child and lend her money\nto study art abroad for a few years. Better take it, and try your hand\nat a girl, mother.'\n\n'No, thank you, I will keep to my own line of business. What is that\nblotted one? It looks rather awful, to judge by the ink,' asked Mrs Jo,\nwho beguiled her daily task by trying to guess from the outside what\nwas inside her many letters. This proved to be a poem from an insane\nadmirer, to judge by its incoherent style.\n\n\n\n         'TO J.M.B.\n\n    'Oh, were I a heliotrope,\n     I would play poet,\n     And blow a breeze of fragrance\n     To you; and none should know it.\n\n    'Your form like the stately elm\n     When Phoebus gilds the morning ray;\n     Your cheeks like the ocean bed\n     That blooms a rose in May.\n\n    'Your words are wise and bright,\n     I bequeath them to you a legacy given;\n     And when your spirit takes its flight,\n     May it bloom aflower in heaven.\n\n    'My tongue in flattering language spoke,\n     And sweeter silence never broke\n     in busiest street or loneliest glen.\n     I take you with the flashes of my pen.\n\n    'Consider the lilies, how they grow;\n     They toil not, yet are fair,\n     Gems and flowers and Solomon's seal.\n     The geranium of the world is J. M. Bhaer.\n\n        'JAMES'\n\n\n\nWhile the boys shouted over this effusion--which is a true one--their\nmother read several liberal offers from budding magazines for her to\nedit them gratis; one long letter from a young girl inconsolable because\nher favourite hero died, and 'would dear Mrs Bhaer rewrite the tale, and\nmake it end good?' another from an irate boy denied an autograph, who\ndarkly foretold financial ruin and loss of favour if she did not\nsend him and all other fellows who asked autographs, photographs, and\nauto-biographical sketches; a minister wished to know her religion;\nand an undecided maiden asked which of her two lovers she should marry.\nThese samples will suffice to show a few of the claims made on a busy\nwoman's time, and make my readers pardon Mrs Jo if she did not carefully\nreply to all.\n\n'That job is done. Now I will dust a bit, and then go to my work. I'm\nall behind-hand, and serials can't wait; so deny me to everybody, Mary.\nI won't see Queen Victoria if she comes today.' And Mrs Bhaer threw down\nher napkin as if defying all creation.\n\n'I hope the day will go well with thee, my dearest,' answered her\nhusband, who had been busy with his own voluminous correspondence. 'I\nwill dine at college with Professor Plock, who is to visit us today. The\nJunglings can lunch on Parnassus; so thou shalt have a quiet time.' And\nsmoothing the worried lines out of her forehead with his good-bye kiss,\nthe excellent man marched away, both pockets full of books, an old\numbrella in one hand, and a bag of stones for the geology class in the\nother.\n\n'If all literary women had such thoughtful angels for husbands, they\nwould live longer and write more. Perhaps that wouldn't be a blessing to\nthe world though, as most of us write too much now,' said Mrs Jo, waving\nher feather duster to her spouse, who responded with flourishes of the\numbrella as he went down the avenue.\n\nRob started for school at the same time, looking so much like him with\nhis books and bag and square shoulders and steady air that his mother\nlaughed as she turned away, saying heartily: 'Bless both my dear\nprofessors, for better creatures never lived!'\n\nEmil was already gone to his ship in the city; but Ted lingered to steal\nthe address he wanted, ravage the sugar-bowl, and talk with 'Mum';\nfor the two had great larks together. Mrs Jo always arranged her own\nparlour, refilled her vases, and gave the little touches that left it\ncool and neat for the day. Going to draw down the curtain, she beheld an\nartist sketching on the lawn, and groaned as she hastily retired to the\nback window to shake her duster.\n\nAt that moment the bell rang and the sound of wheels was heard in the\nroad.\n\n'I'll go; Mary lets 'em in'; and Ted smoothed his hair as he made for\nthe hall.\n\n'Can't see anyone. Give me a chance to fly upstairs,' whispered Mrs Jo,\npreparing to escape. But before she could do so, a man appeared at the\ndoor with a card in his hand. Ted met him with a stern air, and his\nmother dodged behind the window-curtains to bide her time for escape.\n\n'I am doing a series of articles for the Saturday Tattler, and I\ncalled to see Mrs Bhaer the first of all,' began the newcomer in the\ninsinuating tone of his tribe, while his quick eyes were taking in all\nthey could, experience having taught him to make the most of his time,\nas his visits were usually short ones.\n\n'Mrs Bhaer never sees reporters, sir.'\n\n'But a few moments will be all I ask,' said the man, edging his way\nfarther in.\n\n'You can't see her, for she is out,' replied Teddy, as a backward glance\nshowed him that his unhappy parent had vanished--through the window, he\nsupposed, as she sometimes did when hard bestead.\n\n'Very sorry. I'll call again. Is this her study? Charming room!' And the\nintruder fell back on the parlour, bound to see something and bag a fact\nif he died in the attempt. 'It is not,' said Teddy, gently but firmly\nbacking him down the hall, devoutly hoping that his mother had escaped\nround the corner of the house.\n\n'If you could tell me Mrs Bhaer's age and birthplace, date of marriage,\nand number of children, I should be much obliged,' continued the\nunabashed visitor as he tripped over the door-mat.\n\n'She is about sixty, born in Nova Zembla, married just forty years ago\ntoday, and has eleven daughters. Anything else, sir?' And Ted's sober\nface was such a funny contrast to his ridiculous reply that the reporter\nowned himself routed, and retired laughing just as a lady followed by\nthree beaming girls came up the steps.\n\n'We are all the way from Oshkosh, and couldn't go home without seein'\ndear Aunt Jo. My girls just admire her works, and lot on gettin' a\nsight of her. I know it's early; but we are goin' to see Holmes and\nLongfeller, and the rest of the celebrities, so we ran out here fust\nthing. Mrs Erastus Kingsbury Parmalee, of Oshkosh, tell her. We don't\nmind waitin'; we can look round a spell if she ain't ready to see folks\nyet.'\n\nAll this was uttered with such rapidity that Ted could only stand\ngazing at the buxom damsels, who fixed their six blue eyes upon him so\nbeseechingly that his native gallantry made it impossible to deny them a\ncivil reply at least.\n\n'Mrs Bhaer is not visible today--out just now, I believe; but you can\nsee the house and grounds if you like,' he murmured, falling back as the\nfour pressed in gazing rapturously about them.\n\n'Oh, thank you! Sweet, pretty place I'm sure! That's where she writes,\nain't it? Do tell me if that's her picture! Looks just as I imagined\nher!'\n\nWith these remarks the ladies paused before a fine engraving of the Hon.\nMrs Norton, with a pen in her hand and a rapt expression of countenance,\nlikewise a diadem and pearl necklace.\n\nKeeping his gravity with an effort, Teddy pointed to a very bad portrait\nof Mrs Jo, which hung behind the door, and afforded her much amusement,\nit was so dismal, in spite of a curious effect of light upon the end of\nthe nose and cheeks as red as the chair she sat in.\n\n'This was taken for my mother; but it is not very good,' he said,\nenjoying the struggles of the girls not to look dismayed at the sad\ndifference between the real and the ideal. The youngest, aged twelve,\ncould not conceal her disappointment, and turned away, feeling as so\nmany of us have felt when we discover that our idols are very ordinary\nmen and women.\n\n'I thought she'd be about sixteen and have her hair braided in two\ntails down her back. I don't care about seeing her now,' said the honest\nchild, walking off to the hall door, leaving her mother to apologize,\nand her sisters to declare that the bad portrait was 'perfectly lovely,\nso speaking and poetic, you know, 'specially about the brow'.\n\n'Come girls, we must be goin', if we want to get through today. You\ncan leave your albums and have them sent when Mrs Bhaer has written a\nsentiment in 'em. We are a thousand times obliged. Give our best love\nto your ma, and tell her we are so sorry not to see her.' Just as\nMrs. Erastus Kingsbury Parmalee uttered the words her eye fell upon a\nmiddle-aged woman in a large checked apron, with a handkerchief tied\nover her head, busily dusting an end room which looked like a study.\n\n'One peep at her sanctum since she is out,' cried the enthusiastic lady,\nand swept across the hall with her flock before Teddy could warn his\nmother, whose retreat had been cut off by the artist in front, the\nreporter at the back of the house--for he hadn't gone and the ladies in\nthe hall.\n\n'They've got her!' thought Teddy, in comical dismay. 'No use for her to\nplay housemaid since they've seen the portrait.'\n\nMrs Jo did her best, and being a good actress, would have escaped if the\nfatal picture had not betrayed her. Mrs Parmalee paused at the desk, and\nregardless of the meerschaum that lay there, the man's slippers close\nby, and a pile of letters directed to 'Prof. F. Bhaer', she clasped her\nhands, exclaiming impressively: 'Girls, this is the spot where she wrote\nthose sweet, those moral tales which have thrilled us to the soul! Could\nI--ah, could I take one morsel of paper, an old pen, a postage stamp\neven, as a memento of this gifted woman?'\n\n'Yes'm, help yourselves,' replied the maid, moving away with a glance at\nthe boy, whose eyes were now full of merriment he could not suppress.\n\nThe oldest girl saw it, guessed the truth, and a quick look at the\nwoman in the apron confirmed her suspicion. Touching her mother, she\nwhispered: 'Ma, it's Mrs Bhaer herself. I know it is.'\n\n'No? yes? it is! Well, I do declare, how nice that is!' And hastily\npursuing the unhappy woman, who was making for the door, Mrs Parmalee\ncried eagerly:\n\n'Don't mind us! I know you're busy, but just let me take your hand and\nthen we'll go.'\n\nGiving herself up for lost, Mrs Jo turned and presented her hand like\na tea-tray, submitting to have it heartily shaken, as the matron said,\nwith somewhat alarming hospitality:\n\n'If ever you come to Oshkosh, your feet won't be allowed to touch the\npavement; for you'll be borne in the arms of the populace, we shall be\nso dreadful glad to see you.'\n\nMentally resolving never to visit that effusive town, Jo responded\nas cordially as she could; and having written her name in the albums,\nprovided each visitor with a memento, and kissed them all round, they at\nlast departed, to call on 'Longfeller, Holmes, and the rest'--who were\nall out, it is devoutly to be hoped.\n\n'You villain, why didn't you give me a chance to whip away? Oh, my dear,\nwhat fibs you told that man! I hope we shall be forgiven our sins in\nthis line, but I don't know what is to become of us if we don't dodge.\nSo many against one isn't fair play.' And Mrs Jo hung up her apron in\nthe hall closet, with a groan at the trials of her lot.\n\n'More people coming up the avenue! Better dodge while the coast is\nclear! I'll head them off!' cried Teddy, looking back from the steps, as\nhe was departing to school.\n\nMrs Jo flew upstairs, and having locked her door, calmly viewed a young\nladies' seminary camp on the lawn, and being denied the house, proceed\nto enjoy themselves by picking the flowers, doing up their hair,\neating lunch, and freely expressing their opinion of the place and its\npossessors before they went.\n\nA few hours of quiet followed, and she was just settling down to a long\nafternoon of hard work, when Rob came home to tell her that the Young\nMen's Christian Union would visit the college, and two or three of the\nfellows whom she knew wanted to pay their respects to her on the way.\n\n'It is going to rain, so they won't come, I dare say; but father thought\nyou'd like to be ready, in case they do call. You always see the boys,\nyou know, though you harden your heart to the poor girls,' said Rob, who\nhad heard from his brother about the morning visitations.\n\n'Boys don't gush, so I can stand it. The last time I let in a party of\ngirls one fell into my arms and said, \"Darling, love me!\" I wanted to\nshake her,' answered Mrs Jo, wiping her pen with energy.\n\n'You may be sure the fellows won't do it, but they will want autographs,\nso you'd better be prepared with a few dozen,' said Rob, laying out a\nquire of notepaper, being a hospitable youth and sympathizing with those\nwho admired his mother.\n\n'They can't outdo the girls. At X College I really believe I wrote\nthree hundred during the day I was there, and I left a pile of cards and\nalbums on my table when I came away. It is one of the most absurd and\ntiresome manias that ever afflicted the world.'\n\nNevertheless Mrs Jo wrote her name a dozen times, put on her black silk,\nand resigned herself to the impending call, praying for rain, however,\nas she returned to her work.\n\nThe shower came, and feeling quite secure, she rumpled up her hair, took\noff her cuffs, and hurried to finish her chapter; for thirty pages a day\nwas her task, and she liked to have it well done before evening. Josie\nhad brought some flowers for the vases, and was just putting the last\ntouches when she saw several umbrellas bobbing down the hill.\n\n'They are coming, Aunty! I see uncle hurrying across the field to\nreceive them,' she called at the stair-foot.\n\n'Keep an eye on them, and let me know when they enter the avenue.\nIt will take but a minute to tidy up and run down,' answered Mrs Jo,\nscribbling away for dear life, because serials wait for no man, not even\nthe whole Christian Union en masse.\n\n'There are more than two or three. I see half a dozen at least,' called\nsister Ann from the hall door. 'No! a dozen, I do believe; Aunty, look\nout; they are all coming! What shall we do?' And Josie quailed at the\nidea of facing the black throng rapidly approaching.\n\n'Mercy on us, there are hundreds! Run and put a tub in the back entry\nfor their umbrellas to drip into. Tell them to go down the hall and\nleave them, and pile their hats on the table; the tree won't hold them\nall. No use to get mats; my poor carpets!' And down went Mrs Jo to\nprepare for the invasion, while Josie and the maids flew about dismayed\nat the prospect of so many muddy boots.\n\nOn they came, a long line of umbrellas, with splashed legs and flushed\nfaces underneath; for the gentlemen had been having a good time all over\nthe town, undisturbed by the rain. Professor Bhaer met them at the gate,\nand was making a little speech of welcome, when Mrs Jo, touched by their\nbedraggled state, appeared at the door, beckoning them in. Leaving\ntheir host to orate bareheaded in the wet, the young men hastened up the\nsteps, merry, warm, and eager, clutching off their hats as they came,\nand struggling with their umbrellas, as the order was passed to march in\nand stack arms.\n\nTramp, tramp, tramp, down the hall went seventy-five pairs of boots;\nsoon seventy-five umbrellas dripped sociably in the hospitable tub,\nwhile their owners swarmed all over the lower part of the house; and\nseventy-five hearty hands were shaken by the hostess without a murmur,\nthough some were wet, some very warm, and nearly all bore trophies of\nthe day's ramble. One impetuous party flourished a small turtle as he\nmade his compliments; another had a load of sticks cut from noted\nspots; and all begged for some memento of Plumfield. A pile of\ncards mysteriously appeared on the table, with a written request for\nautographs; and despite her morning vow, Mrs Jo wrote everyone, while\nher husband and boys did the honours of the house.\n\nJosie fled to the back parlour, but was discovered by exploring youths,\nand mortally insulted by one of them, who innocently inquired if she was\nMrs Bhaer. The reception did not last long, and the end was better than\nthe beginning; for the rain ceased, and a rainbow shone beautifully\nover them as the good fellows stood upon the lawn singing sweetly for a\nfarewell. A happy omen, that bow of promise arched over the young heads,\nas if Heaven smiled upon their union, and showed them that above the\nmuddy earth and rainy skies the blessed sun still shone for all. Three\ncheers, and then away they went, leaving a pleasant recollection of\ntheir visit to amuse the family as they scraped the mud off the carpets\nwith shovels and emptied the tub half-full of water.\n\n'Nice, honest, hard-working fellows, and I don't begrudge my half-hour\nat all; but I must finish, so don't let anyone disturb me till\ntea-time,' said Mrs Jo, leaving Mary to shut up the house; for papa and\nthe boys had gone off with the guests, and Josie had run home to tell\nher mother about the fun at Aunt Jo's.\n\nPeace reigned for an hour, then the bell rang and Mary came giggling\nup to say: 'A queer kind of a lady wants to know if she can catch a\ngrasshopper in the garden.'\n\n'A what?' cried Mrs Jo, dropping her pen with a blot; for of all the odd\nrequests ever made, this was the oddest.\n\n'A grasshopper, ma'am. I said you was busy, and asked what she wanted,\nand says she: \"I've got grasshoppers from the grounds of several famous\nfolks, and I want one from Plumfield to add to my collection.\" Did you\never?' And Mary giggled again at the idea.\n\n'Tell her to take all there are and welcome. I shall be glad to get rid\nof them; always bouncing in my face and getting in my dress,' laughed\nMrs Jo.\n\nMary retired, to return in a moment nearly speechless with merriment.\n\n'She's much obliged, ma'am, and she'd like an old gown or a pair\nof stockings of yours to put in a rug she's making. Got a vest of\nEmerson's, she says, and a pair of Mr. Holmes's trousers, and a dress of\nMrs Stowe's. She must be crazy!'\n\n'Give her that old red shawl, then I shall make a gay show among the\ngreat ones in that astonishing rug. Yes, they are all lunatics, these\nlion-hunters; but this seems to be a harmless maniac, for she doesn't\ntake my time, and gives me a good laugh,' said Mrs Jo, returning to her\nwork after a glance from the window, which showed her a tall, thin lady\nin rusty black, skipping wildly to and fro on the lawn in pursuit of the\nlively insect she wanted.\n\nNo more interruptions till the light began to fade, then Mary popped her\nhead in to say a gentleman wished to see Mrs Bhaer, and wouldn't take no\nfor an answer.\n\n'He must. I shall not go down. This has been an awful day, and I won't\nbe disturbed again,' replied the harassed authoress, pausing in the\nmidst of the grand finale of her chapter.\n\n'I told him so, ma'am; but he walked right in as bold as brass. I guess\nhe's another crazy one, and I declare I'm 'most afraid of him, he's\nso big and black, and cool as cucumbers, though I will say he's\ngood-looking,' added Mary, with a simper; for the stranger had evidently\nfound favour in her sight despite his boldness.\n\n'My day has been ruined, and I will have this last half-hour to finish.\nTell him to go away; I won't go down,' cried Mrs Jo, fiercely.\n\nMary went; and listening, in spite of herself, her mistress heard first\na murmur of voices, then a cry from Mary, and remembering the ways of\nreporters, also that her maid was both pretty and timid, Mrs Bhaer flung\ndown her pen and went to the rescue. Descending with her most majestic\nair she demanded in an awe-inspiring voice, as she paused to survey the\nsomewhat brigandish intruder, who seemed to be storming the staircase\nwhich Mary was gallantly defending:\n\n'Who is this person who insists on remaining when I have declined to see\nhim?'\n\n'I'm sure I don't know, ma'am. He won't give no name, and says you'll\nbe sorry if you don't see him,' answered Mary, retiring flushed and\nindignant from her post.\n\n'Won't you be sorry?' asked the stranger, looking up with a pair of\nblack eyes full of laughter, the flash of white teeth through a long\nbeard, and both hands out as he boldly approached the irate lady.\n\nMrs Jo gave one keen look, for the voice was familiar; then completed\nMary's bewilderment by throwing both arms round the brigand's neck,\nexclaiming joyfully: 'My dearest boy, where did you come from?'\n\n'California, on purpose to see you, Mother Bhaer. Now won't you be sorry\nif I go away?' answered Dan, with a hearty kiss.\n\n'To think of my ordering you out of the house when I've been longing to\nsee you for a year,' laughed Mrs Jo, and she went down to have a good\ntalk with her returned wanderer, who enjoyed the joke immensely.\n\n\n\nChapter 4. DAN\n\nMrs Jo often thought that Dan had Indian blood in him, not only because\nof his love of a wild, wandering life, but his appearance; for as he\ngrew up, this became more striking. At twenty-five he was very tall,\nwith sinewy limbs, a keen, dark face, and the alert look of one whose\nsenses were all alive; rough in manner, full of energy, quick with word\nand blow, eyes full of the old fire, always watchful as if used to keep\nguard, and a general air of vigour and freshness very charming to\nthose who knew the dangers and delights of his adventurous life. He was\nlooking his best as he sat talking with 'Mother Bhaer', one strong brown\nhand in hers, and a world of affection in his voice as he said:\n\n'Forget old friends! How could I forget the only home I ever knew? Why,\nI was in such a hurry to come and tell my good luck that I didn't stop\nto fix up, you see; though I knew you'd think I looked more like a wild\nbuffalo than ever,' with a shake of his shaggy black head, a tug at his\nbeard, and a laugh that made the room ring.\n\n'I like it; I always had a fancy for banditti--and you look just like\none. Mary, being a newcomer, was frightened at your looks and manners.\nJosie won't know you, but Ted will recognize his Danny in spite of the\nbig beard and flowing mane. They will all be here soon to welcome you;\nso before they come tell me more about yourself. Why, Dan, dear! it's\nnearly two years since you were here! Has it gone well with you?' asked\nMrs Jo, who had been listening with maternal interest to his account of\nlife in California, and the unexpected success of a small investment he\nhad made.\n\n'First-rate! I don't care for the money, you know. I only want a trifle\nto pay my way--rather earn as I go, and not be bothered with the care of\na lot. It's the fun of the thing coming to me, and my being able to give\naway, that I like. No use to lay up; I shan't live to be old and need\nit,--my sort never do,' said Dan, looking as if his little fortune\nrather oppressed him.\n\n'But if you marry and settle somewhere, as I hope you will, you must\nhave something to begin with, my son. So be prudent and invest your\nmoney; don't give it away, for rainy days come to all of us, and\ndependence would be very hard for you to bear,' answered Mrs Jo with a\nsage air, though she liked to see that the money-making fever had not\nseized her lucky boy yet.\n\nDan shook his head, and glanced about the room as if he already found it\nrather confined and longed for all out-of-doors again.\n\n'Who would marry a jack-o'-lantern like me? Women like a steady-going\nman; I shall never be that.'\n\n'My dear boy, when I was a girl I liked just such adventurous fellows\nas you are. Anything fresh and daring, free and romantic, is always\nattractive to us womenfolk. Don't be discouraged; you'll find an anchor\nsome day, and be content to take shorter voyages and bring home a good\ncargo.'\n\n'What should you say if I brought you an Indian squaw some day?' asked\nDan, with a glimmer of mischief in the eyes that rested on a marble bust\nof Galatea gleaming white and lovely in the corner.\n\n'Welcome her heartily, if she was a good one. Is there a prospect of\nit?' and Mrs Jo peered at him with the interest which even literary\nladies take in love affairs.\n\n'Not at present, thank you. I'm too busy \"to gallivant\", as Ted calls\nit. How is the boy?' asked Dan, skilfully turning the conversation, as\nif he had had enough of sentiment.\n\nMrs Jo was off at once, and expatiated upon the talents and virtues\nof her sons till they came bursting in and fell upon Dan like two\naffectionate young bears, finding a vent for their joyful emotions in a\nsort of friendly wrestling-match; in which both got worsted, of course,\nfor the hunter soon settled them. The Professor followed, and tongues\nwent like mill-clappers while Mary lighted up and cook devoted herself\nto an unusually good supper, instinctively divining that this guest was\na welcome one.\n\nAfter tea Dan was walking up and down the long rooms as he talked, with\noccasional trips into the hall for a fresher breath of air, his lungs\nseeming to need more than those of civilized people. In one of these\ntrips he saw a white figure framed in the dark doorway, and paused to\nlook at it. Bess paused also, not recognizing her old friend, and quite\nunconscious of the pretty picture she made standing, tall and slender,\nagainst the soft gloom of the summer night, with her golden hair like a\nhalo round her head, and the ends of a white shawl blown out like wings\nby the cool wind sweeping through the hail. 'Is it Dan?' she asked,\ncoming in with a gracious smile and outstretched hand.\n\n'Looks like it; but I didn't know you, Princess. I thought it was a\nspirit,' answered Dan, looking down at her with a curious softness and\nwonder in his face.\n\n'I've grown very much, but two years have changed you entirely'; and\nBess looked up with girlish pleasure at the picturesque figure before\nher--for it was a decided contrast to the well-dressed people about her.\n\nBefore they could say more, Josie rushed in, and, forgetfull of the\nnewly acquired dignity of her teens, let Dan catch her up and kiss her\nlike a child. Not till he set her down did he discover she also was\nchanged, and exclaimed in comic dismay:\n\n'Hallo! Why, you are growing up too! What am I going to do, with no\nyoung one to play with? Here's Ted going it like a beanstalk, and Bess a\nyoung lady, and even you, my mustard-seed, letting down your frocks and\nputting on airs.'\n\nThe girls laughed, and Josie blushed as she stared at the tall man,\nconscious that she had leaped before she looked. They made a pretty\ncontrast, these two young cousins--one as fair as a lily, the other\na little wild rose. And Dan gave a nod of satisfaction as he surveyed\nthem; for he had seen many bonny girls in his travels, and was glad that\nthese old friends were blooming so beautifully.\n\n'Here! we can't allow any monopoly of Dan!' called Mrs Jo. 'Bring him\nback and keep an eye on him, or he will be slipping off for another\nlittle run of a year or two before we have half seen him.'\n\nLed by these agreeable captors, Dan returned to the parlour to receive a\nscolding from Josie for getting ahead of all the other boys and looking\nlike a man first.\n\n'Emil is older; but he's only a boy, and dances jigs and sings sailor\nsongs just as he used to. You look about thirty, and as big and black\nas a villain in a play. Oh, I've got a splendid idea! You are just the\nthing for Arbaces in The Last Days of Pompeii. We want to act it; have\nthe lion and the gladiators and the eruption. Tom and Ted are going to\nshower bushels of ashes down and roll barrels of stones about. We wanted\na dark man for the Egyptian; and you will be gorgeous in red and white\nshawls. Won't he, Aunt Jo?'\n\nThis deluge of words made Dan clap his hands over his ears; and before\nMrs Bhaer could answer her impetuous niece the Laurences, with Meg and\nher family, arrived, soon followed by Tom and Nan, and all sat down to\nlisten to Dan's adventures--told in brief yet effective manner, as the\nvarying expressions of interest, wonder, merriment, and suspense painted\non the circle of faces round him plainly showed. The boys all wanted to\nstart at once for California and make fortunes; the girls could hardly\nwait for the curious and pretty things he had picked up for them in his\ntravels; while the elders rejoiced heartily over the energy and good\nprospects of their wild boy.\n\n'Of course you will want to go back for another stroke of luck; and I\nhope you will have it. But speculation is a dangerous game, and you may\nlose all you've won,' said Mr Laurie, who had enjoyed the stirring tale\nas much as any of the boys, and would have liked to rough it with Dan as\nwell as they.\n\n'I've had enough of it, for a while at least; too much like gambling.\nThe excitement is all I care for, and it isn't good for me. I have a\nnotion to try farming out West. It's grand on a large scale; and I feel\nas if steady work would be rather jolly after loafing round so long. I\ncan make a beginning, and you can send me your black sheep to stock my\nplace with. I tried sheep-farming in Australia, and know something about\nblack ones, any way.'\n\nA laugh chased away the sober look in Dan's face as he ended; and those\nwho knew him best guessed that he had learned a lesson there in San\nFrancisco, and dared not try again.\n\n'That is a capital idea, Dan!' cried Mrs Jo, seeing great hope in this\ndesire to fix himself somewhere and help others. 'We shall know where\nyou are, and can go and see you, and not have half the world between us.\nI'll send my Ted for a visit. He's such a restless spirit, it would\ndo him good. With you he would be safe while he worked off his surplus\nenergies and learned a wholesome business.'\n\n'I'll use the \"shubble and de hoe\" like a good one, if I get a chance\nout there; but the Speranza mines sound rather jollier,' said Ted,\nexamining the samples of ore Dan had brought for the Professor.\n\n'You go and start a new town, and when we are ready to swarm we will\ncome out and settle there. You will want a newspaper very soon, and I\nlike the idea of running one myself much better than grinding away as\nI do now,' observed Demi, panting to distinguish himself in the\njournalistic line.\n\n'We could easily plant a new college there. These sturdy Westerners are\nhungry for learning, and very quick to see and choose the best,' added\never-young Mr March, beholding with his prophetic eye many duplicates of\ntheir own flourishing establishment springing up in the wide West.\n\n'Go on, Dan. It is a fine plan, and we will back you up. I shouldn't\nmind investing in a few prairies and cowboys myself,' said Mr Laurie,\nalways ready to help the lads to help themselves, both by his cheery\nwords and ever-open purse.\n\n'A little money sort of ballasts a fellow, and investing it in land\nanchors him--for a while, at least. I'd like to see what I can do, but\nI thought I'd consult you before I decided. Have my doubts about it\nsuiting me for many years; but I can cut loose when I'm tired,' answered\nDan, both touched and pleased at the eager interest of these friends in\nhis plans.\n\n'I know you won't like it. After having the whole world to roam over,\none farm will seem dreadfully small and stupid,' said Josie, who much\npreferred the romance of the wandering life which brought her thrilling\ntales and pretty things at each return.\n\n'Is there any art out there?' asked Bess, thinking what a good study in\nblack and white Dan would make as he stood talking, half turned from the\nlight.\n\n'Plenty of nature, dear; and that is better. You will find splendid\nanimals to model, and scenery such as you never saw in Europe to paint.\nEven prosaic pumpkins are grand out there. You can play Cinderella in\none of them, Josie, when you open your theatre in Dansville,' said Mr\nLaurie, anxious that no cold water should be thrown on the new plan.\n\nStage-struck Josie was caught at once, and being promised all the tragic\nparts on the yet unbuilt stage, she felt a deep interest in the project\nand begged Dan to lose no time in beginning his experiment. Bess also\nconfessed that studies from nature would be good for her, and wild\nscenery improve her taste, which might grow over-nice if only the\ndelicate and beautiful were set before her.\n\n'I speak for the practice of the new town,' said Nan, always eager\nfor fresh enterprises. 'I shall be ready by the time you get well\nstarted--towns grow so fast out there.'\n\n'Dan isn't going to allow any woman under forty in his place. He doesn't\nlike them, 'specially young and pretty ones,' put in Tom, who was raging\nwith jealousy, because he read admiration for Nan in Dan's eyes.\n\n'That won't affect me, because doctors are exceptions to all rules.\nThere won't be much sickness in Dansville, everyone will lead such\nactive, wholesome lives, and only energetic young people will go there.\nBut accidents will be frequent, owing to wild cattle, fast riding,\nIndian scrimmages, and the recklessness of Western life. That will just\nsuit me. I long for broken bones, surgery is so interesting and I get so\nlittle here,' answered Nan, yearning to put out her shingle and begin.\n\n'I'll have you, Doctor, and be glad of such a good sample of what we can\ndo in the East. Peg away, and I'll send for you as soon as I have a roof\nto cover you. I'll scalp a few red fellows or smash up a dozen or so of\ncowboys for your special benefit,' laughed Dan, well pleased with the\nenergy and fine physique which made Nan a conspicuous figure among other\ngirls.\n\n'Thanks. I'll come. Would you just let me feel your arm? Splendid\nbiceps! Now, boys, see here: this is what I call muscle.' And Nan\ndelivered a short lecture with Dan's sinewy arm to illustrate it. Tom\nretired to the alcove and glowered at the stars, while he swung his own\nright arm with a vigour suggestive of knocking someone down.\n\n'Make Tom sexton; he'll enjoy burying the patients Nan kills. He's\ntrying to get up the glum expression proper to the business. Don't\nforget him, Dan,' said Ted, directing attention to the blighted being in\nthe corner.\n\nBut Tom never sulked long, and came out from his brief eclipse with the\ncheerful proposition:\n\n'Look here, we'll get the city to ship out to Dansville all the cases of\nyellow fever, smallpox, and cholera that arrive; then Nan will be happy\nand her mistakes won't matter much with emigrants and convicts.'\n\n'I should advise settling near Jacksonville, or some such city, that you\nmight enjoy the society of cultivated persons. The Plato Club is there,\nand a most ardent thirst for philosophy. Everything from the East is\nwelcomed hospitably, and new enterprises would flourish in such kindly\nsoil,' observed Mr March, mildly offering a suggestion, as he sat among\nthe elders enjoying the lively scene.\n\nThe idea of Dan studying Plato was very funny; but no one except naughty\nTed smiled, and Dan made haste to unfold another plan seething in that\nactive brain of his.\n\n'I'm not sure the farming will succeed, and have a strong leaning\ntowards my old friends the Montana Indians. They are a peaceful tribe,\nand need help awfully; hundreds have died of starvation because they\ndon't get their share. The Sioux are fighters, thirty thousand strong,\nso Government fears 'em, and gives 'em all they want. I call that a\ndamned shame!' Dan stopped short as the oath slipped out, but his eyes\nflashed, and he went on quickly: 'It is just that, and I won't beg\npardon. If I'd had any money when I was there I'd have given every cent\nto those poor devils, cheated out of everything, and waiting patiently,\nafter being driven from their own land to places where nothing will\ngrow. Now, honest agents could do much, and I've a feeling that I ought\nto go and lend a hand. I know their lingo, and I like 'em. I've got a\nfew thousands, and I ain't sure I have any right to spend it on myself\nand settle down to enjoy it. Hey?'\n\nDan looked very manly and earnest as he faced his friends, flushed and\nexcited by the energy of his words; and all felt that little thrill of\nsympathy which links hearts together by the tie of pity for the wronged.\n\n'Do it, do it!' cried Mrs Jo, fired at once; for misfortune was much\nmore interesting to her than good luck.\n\n'Do it, do it!' echoed Ted, applauding as if at a play, 'and take me\nalong to help. I'm just raging to get among those fine fellows and\nhunt.'\n\n'Let us hear more and see if it is wise,' said Mr Laurie, privately\nresolving to people his as yet unbought prairies with Montana Indians,\nand increase his donations to the society that sent missionaries to this\nmuch wronged people.\n\nDan plunged at once into the history of what he saw among the Dakotas,\nand other tribes in the Northwest, telling of their wrongs, patience,\nand courage as if they were his brothers.\n\n'They called me Dan Fire Cloud, because my rifle was the best they ever\nsaw. And Black Hawk was as good a friend as a fellow would want; saved\nmy life more than once, and taught me just what will be useful if I go\nback. They are down on their luck, now, and I'd like to pay my debts.'\n\nBy this time everyone was interested, and Dansville began to lose its\ncharm. But prudent Mr Bhaer suggested that one honest agent among many\ncould not do much, and noble as the effort would be, it was wiser to\nthink over the matter carefully, get influence and authority from the\nright quarters, and meantime look at lands before deciding.\n\n'Well, I will. I'm going to take a run to Kansas and see how that\npromises. Met a fellow in 'Frisco who'd been there, and he spoke well\nof it. The fact is, there's so much to be done every where that I don't\nknow where to catch on, and half wish I hadn't any money,' answered Dan,\nknitting his brows in the perplexity all kind souls feel when anxious to\nhelp at the great task of the world's charity.\n\n'I'll keep it for you till you decide. You are such an impetuous lad\nyou'll give it to the first beggar that gets hold of you. I'll turn it\nover while you are prospecting, and hand it back when you are ready to\ninvest, shall I?' asked Mr Laurie, who had learned wisdom since the days\nof his own extravagant youth.\n\n'Thanky, sir, I'd be glad to get rid of it. You just hold on till I say\nthe word; and if anything happens to me this time, keep it to help some\nother scamp as you helped me. This is my will, and you all witness it.\nNow I feel better.' And Dan squared his shoulders as if relieved of\na burden, after handing over the belt in which he carried his little\nfortune.\n\nNo one dreamed how much was to happen before Dan came to take his money\nback, nor how nearly that act was his last will and testament; and while\nMr Laurie was explaining how he would invest it, a cheery voice was\nheard singing:\n\n    'Oh, Peggy was a jolly lass,\n     Ye heave ho, boys, ye heave ho!\n     She never grudged her Jack a glass,\n     Ye heave ho, boys, ye heave ho!\n     And when he sailed the raging main,\n     She faithful was unto her swain,\n     Ye heave ho, boys, ye heave ho!'\n\nEmil always announced his arrival in that fashion, and in a moment he\ncame hurrying in with Nat, who had been giving lessons in town all day.\nIt was good to see the latter beam at his friend as he nearly shook his\nhand off; better still to see how Dan gratefully remembered all he owed\nNat, and tried to pay the debt in his rough way; and best of all to\nhear the two travellers compare notes and reel off yarns to dazzle the\nland-lubbers and home-keepers.\n\nAfter this addition the house would not contain the gay youngsters, so\nthey migrated to the piazza and settled on the steps, like a flock of\nnight-loving birds. Mr March and the Professor retired to the study, Meg\nand Amy went to look after the little refection of fruit and cake which\nwas to come, and Mrs Jo and Mr Laurie sat in the long window listening\nto the chat that went on outside.\n\n'There they are, the flower of our flock!' she said, pointing to the\ngroup before them. 'The others are dead or scattered, but these seven\nboys and four girls are my especial comfort and pride. Counting Alice\nHeath, my dozen is made up, and my hands are full trying to guide these\nyoung lives as far as human skill can do it.'\n\n'When we remember how different they are, from what some of them came,\nand the home influences about others, I think we may feel pretty well\nsatisfied so far,' answered Mr Laurie soberly, as his eyes rested on\none bright head among the black and brown ones, for the young moon shone\nalike on all.\n\n'I don't worry about the girls; Meg sees to them, and is so wise and\npatient and tender they can't help doing well; but my boys are more care\nevery year, and seem to drift farther away from me each time they go,'\nsighed Mrs Jo. 'They will grow up, and I can only hold them by one\nlittle thread, which may snap at any time, as it has with Jack and Ned.\nDolly and George still like to come back, and I can say my word to them;\nand dear old Franz is too true ever to forget his own. But the three\nwho are soon going out into the world again I can't help worrying about.\nEmil's good heart will keep him straight, I hope, and\n\n    '\"A sweet little cherub sits up aloft,\n    To look out for the life of poor Jack.\"'\n\nNat is to make his first flight, and he's weak in spite of your\nstrengthening influence; and Dan is still untamed. I fear it will take\nsome hard lesson to do that.'\n\n'He's a fine fellow, Jo, and I almost regret this farming project. A\nlittle polish would make a gentleman of him, and who knows what he might\nbecome here among us,' answered Mr Laurie, leaning over Mrs Bhaer's\nchair, just as he used to do years ago when they had mischievous secrets\ntogether.\n\n'It wouldn't be safe, Teddy. Work and the free life he loves will make a\ngood man of him, and that is better than any amount of polish, with\nthe dangers an easy life in a city would bring him. We can't change his\nnature--only help it to develop in the right direction. The old impulses\nare there, and must be controlled, or he will go wrong. I see that; but\nhis love for us is a safeguard, and we must keep a hold on him till he\nis older or has a stronger tie to help him.'\n\nMrs Jo spoke earnestly, for, knowing Dan better than anyone else, she\nsaw that her colt was not thoroughly broken yet, and feared while she\nhoped, knowing that life would always be hard for one like him. She was\nsure that before he went away again, in some quiet moment he would give\nher a glimpse of his inner self, and then she could say the word of\nwarning or encouragement that he needed. So she bided her time, studying\nhim meanwhile, glad to see all that was promising, and quick to detect\nthe harm the world was doing him. She was very anxious to make a success\nof her 'firebrand' because others predicted failure; but having learned\nthat people cannot be moulded like clay, she contented herself with the\nhope that this neglected boy might become a good man, and asked no more.\nEven that was much to expect, so full was he of wayward impulses, strong\npassions, and the lawless nature born in him. Nothing held him but\nthe one affection of his life--the memory of Plumfield, the fear\nof disappointing these faithful friends, the pride, stronger than\nprinciple, that made him want to keep the regard of the mates who always\nhad admired and loved him in spite of all his faults.\n\n'Don't fret, old dear; Emil is one of the happy-go-lucky sort who always\nfall on their legs. I'll see to Nat, and Dan is in a good way now. Let\nhim take a look at Kansas, and if the farm plan loses its charm, he\ncan fall back on poor Lo, and really do good out there. He's unusually\nfitted for that peculiar task and I hope he'll decide to do it. Fighting\noppressors, and befriending the oppressed will keep those dangerous\nenergies of his busy, and the life will suit him better than sheep-folds\nand wheat-fields.'\n\n'I hope so. What is that?' and Mrs Jo leaned forward to listen, as\nexclamations from Ted and Josie caught her ear.\n\n'A mustang! a real, live one; and we can ride it. Dan, you are a\nfirst-class trump!' cried the boy.\n\n'A whole Indian dress for me! Now I can play Namioka, if the boys act\nMetamora,' added Josie, clapping her hands.\n\n'A buffalo's head for Bess! Good gracious, Dan, why did you bring such a\nhorrid thing as that to her?' asked Nan.\n\n'Thought it would do her good to model something strong and natural.\nShe'll never amount to anything if she keeps on making namby-pamby gods\nand pet kittens,' answered irreverent Dan, remembering that when he was\nlast here Bess was vibrating distractedly between a head of Apollo and\nher Persian cat as models.\n\n'Thank you; I'll try it, and if I fail we can put the buffalo up in the\nhall to remind us of you,' said Bess, indignant at the insult offered\nthe gods of her idolatry, but too well bred to show it except in her\nvoice, which was as sweet and as cold as ice-cream.\n\n'I suppose you won't come out to see our new settlement when the rest\ndo? Too rough for you?' asked Dan, trying to assume the deferential air\nall the boys used when addressing their Princess.\n\n'I am going to Rome to study for years. All the beauty and art of the\nworld is there, and a lifetime isn't long enough to enjoy it,' answered\nBess.\n\n'Rome is a mouldy old tomb compared to the \"Garden of the gods\" and my\nmagnificent Rockies. I don't care a hang for art; nature is as much as I\ncan stand, and I guess I could show you things that would knock your old\nmasters higher than kites. Better come, and while Josie rides the horses\nyou can model 'em. If a drove of a hundred or so of wild ones can't show\nyou beauty, I'll give up,' cried Dan, waxing enthusiastic over the wild\ngrace and vigour which he could enjoy but had no power to describe.\n\n'I'll come some day with papa, and see if they are better than the\nhorses of St Mark and those on Capitol Hill. Please don't abuse my gods,\nand I will try to like yours,' said Bess, beginning to think the West\nmight be worth seeing, though no Raphael or Angelo had yet appeared\nthere.\n\n'That's a bargain! I do think people ought to see their own country\nbefore they go scooting off to foreign parts, as if the new world wasn't\nworth discovering,' began Dan, ready to bury the hatchet.\n\n'It has some advantages, but not all. The women of England can vote,\nand we can't. I'm ashamed of America that she isn't ahead in all good\nthings,' cried Nan, who held advanced views on all reforms, and was\nanxious about her rights, having had to fight for some of them.\n\n'Oh, please don't begin on that. People always quarrel over that\nquestion, and call names, and never agree. Do let us be quiet and happy\ntonight,' pleaded Daisy, who hated discussion as much as Nan loved it.\n\n'You shall vote as much as you like in our new town, Nan; be mayor and\naldermen, and run the whole concern. It's going to be as free as air,\nor I can't live in it,' said Dan, adding, with a laugh, 'I see Mrs\nGiddygaddy and Mrs Shakespeare Smith don't agree any better than they\nused to.'\n\n'If everyone agreed, we should never get on. Daisy is a dear, but\ninclined to be an old fogy; so I stir her up; and next fall she will go\nand vote with me. Demi will escort us to do the one thing we are allowed\nto do as yet.'\n\n'Will you take 'em, Deacon?' asked Dan, using the old name as if he\nliked it. 'It works capitally in Wyoming.'\n\n'I shall be proud to do it. Mother and the aunts go every year, and\nDaisy will come with me. She is my better half still; and I don't mean\nto leave her behind in anything,' said Demi, with an arm round his\nsister of whom he was fonder than ever.\n\nDan looked at them wistfully, thinking how sweet it must be to have such\na tie; and his lonely youth seemed sadder than ever as he recalled its\nstruggles. A gusty sigh from Tom made sentiment impossible, as he said\npensively:\n\n'I always wanted to be a twin. It's so sociable and so cosy to have\nsomeone glad to lean on a fellow and comfort him, if other girls are\ncruel.'\n\nAs Tom's unrequited passion was the standing joke of the family, this\nallusion produced a laugh, which Nan increased by whipping out a bottle\nof Nux, saying, with her professional air:\n\n'I knew you ate too much lobster for tea. Take four pellets, and your\ndyspepsia will be all right. Tom always sighs and is silly when he's\novereaten.'\n\n'I'll take 'em. These are the only sweet things you ever give me.' And\nTom gloomily crunched his dose.\n\n'\"Who can minister to a mind diseased, or pluck out a rooted sorrow?\"\nquoted Josie tragically from her perch on the railing.\n\n'Come with me, Tommy, and I'll make a man of you. Drop your pills and\npowders, and cavort round the world a spell, and you'll soon forget\nyou've got a heart, or a stomach either,' said Dan, offering his one\npanacea for all ills.\n\n'Ship with me, Tom. A good fit of seasickness will set you up, and\na stiff north-easter blow your blue-devils away. Come along as\nsurgeon--easy berth, and no end of larks.'\n\n    '\"And if your Nancy frowns, my lad,\n      And scorns a jacket blue,\n      Just hoist your sails for other ports,\n      And find a maid more true.\"'\n\nadded Emil, who had a fragment of song to cheer every care and sorrow,\nand freely offered them to his friends.\n\n'Perhaps I'll think of it when I've got my diploma. I'm not going to\ngrind three mortal years and have nothing to show for it. Till then,--'\n\n'I'll never desert Mrs Micawber,' interrupted Teddy, with a gurgling\nsob. Tom immediately rolled him off the step into the wet grass below;\nand by the time this slight skirmish was over, the jingle of teaspoons\nsuggested refreshments of a more agreeable sort. In former times the\nlittle girls waited on the boys, to save confusion; now the young men\nflew to serve the ladies, young and old; and that slight fact showed\nplainly how the tables were turned by time. And what a pleasant\narrangement it was! Even Josie sat still, and let Emil bring her\nberries; enjoying her young lady-hood, till Ted stole her cake, when she\nforgot manners, and chastised him with a rap on the knuckles. As guest\nof honour, Dan was only allowed to wait on Bess, who still held the\nhighest place in this small world. Tom carefully selected the best of\neverything for Nan, to be crushed by the remark:\n\n'I never eat at this hour; and you will have a nightmare if you do.'\n\nSo, dutifully curbing the pangs of hunger, he gave the plate to Daisy,\nand chewed rose-leaves for his supper.\n\nWhen a surprising quantity of wholesome nourishment had been consumed,\nsomeone said, 'Let's sing!' and a tuneful hour followed. Nat fiddled,\nDemi piped, Dan strummed the old banjo, and Emil warbled a doleful\nballad about the wreck of the Bounding Betsey; then everybody joined\nin the old songs till there was very decidedly 'music in the air'; and\npassers-by said, as they listened smiling: 'Old Plum is gay tonight!'\n\nWhen all had gone Dan lingered on the piazza, enjoying the balmy wind\nthat blew up from the hayfields, and brought the breath of flowers from\nParnassus; and as he leaned there romantically in the moonlight, Mrs Jo\ncame to shut the door.\n\n'Dreaming dreams, Dan?' she asked, thinking the tender moment might have\ncome. Imagine the shock when, instead of some interesting confidence or\naffectionate word, Dan swung round, saying bluntly:\n\n'I was wishing I could smoke.'\n\nMrs Jo laughed at the downfall of her hopes, and answered kindly:\n\n'You may, in your room; but don't set the house afire.'\n\nPerhaps Dan saw a little disappointment in her face, or the memory of\nthe sequel of that boyish frolic touched his heart; for he stooped and\nkissed her, saying in a whisper: 'Good night, mother.' And Mrs Jo was\nhalf satisfied.\n\n\n\nChapter 5. VACATION\n\nEveryone was glad of a holiday next morning, and all lingered over the\nbreakfast-table, till Mrs Jo suddenly exclaimed:\n\n'Why, there's a dog!' And on the threshold of the door appeared a great\ndeer-hound, standing motionless, with his eyes fixed on Dan.\n\n'Hallo, old boy! Couldn't you wait till I came for you? Have you cut\naway on the sly? Own up now, and take your whipping like a man,' said\nDan, rising to meet the dog, who reared on his hind legs to look his\nmaster in the face and bark as if uttering an indignant denial of any\ndisobedience.\n\n'All right; Don never lies.' And Dan gave the tall beast a hug, adding\nas he glanced out of the window, where a man and horse were seen\napproaching:\n\n'I left my plunder at the hotel over night, not knowing how I should\nfind you. Come out and see Octoo, my mustang; she's a beauty.' And Dan\nwas off, with the family streaming after him, to welcome the newcomer.\n\nThey found her preparing to go up the steps in her eagerness to reach\nher master, to the great dismay of the man, who was holding her back.\n\n'Let her come,' called Dan; 'she climbs like a cat and jumps like a\ndeer. Well, my girl, do you want a gallop?' he asked, as the pretty\ncreature clattered up to him and whinnied with pleasure as he rubbed her\nnose and slapped her glossy flank.\n\n'That's what I call a horse worth having,' said Ted, full of admiration\nand delight; for he was to have the care of her during Dan's absence.\n\n'What intelligent eyes! She looks as if she would speak,' said Mrs Jo.\n\n'She talks like a human in her way. Very little that she don't know.\nHey, old Lass?' and Dan laid his cheek to hers as if the little black\nmare was very dear to him.\n\n'What does \"Octoo\" mean?' asked Rob.\n\n'Lightning; she deserves it, as you'll see. Black Hawk gave her to me\nfor my rifle, and we've had high times together out yonder. She's saved\nmy life more than once. Do you see that scar?'\n\nDan pointed to a small one, half hidden by the long mane; and standing\nwith his arm about Octoo's neck, he told the story of it.\n\n'Black Hawk and I were after buffalo one time, but didn't find 'em as\nsoon as we expected; so our food gave out, and there we were a hundred\nmiles from Red Deer River, where our camp was. I thought we were done\nfor, but my brave pal says: \"Now I'll show you how we can live till\nwe find the herds.\" We were unsaddling for the night by a little pond;\nthere wasn't a living creature in sight anywhere, not even a bird, and\nwe could see for miles over the prairies. What do you think we did?' And\nDan looked into the faces round him.\n\n'Ate worms like the Australian fellows,' said Rob. 'Boiled grass or\nleaves,' added Mrs Jo.\n\n'Perhaps filled the stomach with clay, as we read of savages doing?'\nsuggested Mr Bhaer.\n\n'Killed one of the horses,' cried Ted, eager for bloodshed of some sort.\n\n'No; but we bled one of them. See, just here; filled a tin cup, put some\nwild sage leaves in it, with water, and heated it over a fire of sticks.\nIt was good, and we slept well.'\n\n'I guess Octoo didn't.' And Josie patted the animal, with a face full of\nsympathy.\n\n'Never minded it a bit. Black Hawk said we could live on the horses\nseveral days and still travel before they felt it. But by another\nmorning we found the buffalo, and I shot the one whose head is in my\nbox, ready to hang up and scare brats into fits. He's a fierce old\nfellow, you bet.'\n\n'What is this strap for?' asked Ted, who was busily examining the Indian\nsaddle, the single rein and snaffle, with lariat, and round the neck the\nleather band he spoke of.\n\n'We hold on to that when we lie along the horse's flank farthest from\nthe enemy, and fire under the neck as we gallop round and round. I'll\nshow you.' And springing into the saddle, Dan was off down the steps,\ntearing over the lawn at a great pace, sometimes on Octoo's back,\nsometimes half hidden as he hung by stirrup and strap, and sometimes\noff altogether, running beside her as she loped along, enjoying the\nfun immensely; while Don raced after, in a canine rapture at being free\nagain and with his mates.\n\nIt was a fine sight--the three wild things at play, so full of vigour,\ngrace, and freedom, that for the moment the smooth lawn seemed a\nprairie; and the spectators felt as if this glimpse of another life made\ntheir own seem rather tame and colourless.\n\n'This is better than a circus!' cried Mrs Jo, wishing she were a girl\nagain, that she might take a gallop on this chained lightning of a\nhorse. 'I foresee that Nan will have her hands full setting bones, for\nTed will break every one of his trying to rival Dan.'\n\n'A few falls will not harm, and this new care and pleasure will be good\nfor him in all ways. But I fear Dan will never follow a plough after\nriding a Pegasus like that,' answered Mr Bhaer, as the black mare leaped\nthe gate and came flying up the avenue, to stop at a word and stand\nquivering with excitement, while Dan swung himself off and looked up for\napplause.\n\nHe received plenty of it, and seemed more pleased for his pet's sake\nthan for his own. Ted clamoured for a lesson at once, and was soon at\nease in the queer saddle, finding Octoo gentle as a lamb, as he trotted\naway to show off at college. Bess came hastening down the hill, having\nseen the race from afar; and all collected on the piazza while Dan\n'yanked' the cover off the big box the express had 'dumped' before the\ndoor--to borrow his own words.\n\nDan usually travelled in light marching order, and hated to have more\nluggage than he could carry in his well-worn valise. But now that he had\na little money of his own, he had cumbered himself with a collection of\ntrophies won by his bow and spear, and brought them home to bestow upon\nhis friends.\n\n'We shall be devoured with moths,' thought Mrs Jo, as the shaggy head\nappeared, followed by a wolf-skin rug for her feet, a bear-skin ditto\nfor the Professor's study, and Indian garments bedecked with foxes'\ntails for the boys.\n\nAll nice and warm for a July day, but received with delight\nnevertheless. Ted and Josie immediately 'dressed up', learned the\nwar-whoop, and proceeded to astonish their friends by a series of\nskirmishes about the house and grounds, with tomahawks and bows and\narrows, till weariness produced a lull.\n\nGay birds' wings, plumy pampas grass, strings of wampum, and pretty work\nin beads, bark, and feathers, pleased the girls. Minerals, arrow-heads,\nand crude sketches interested the Professor; and when the box was empty,\nDan gave Mr Laurie, as his gift, several plaintive Indian songs written\non birch-bark.\n\n'We only want a tent over us to be quite perfect. I feel as if I ought\nto give you parched corn and dried meat for dinner, my braves. Nobody\nwill want lamb and green peas after this splendid pow-wow,' said Mrs Jo,\nsurveying the picturesque confusion of the long hall, where people lay\nabout on the rugs, all more or less bedecked with feathers, moccasins,\nor beads.\n\n'Moose noses, buffalo tongues, bear steaks, and roasted marrow-bones\nwould be the thing, but I don't mind a change; so bring on your baa-baa\nand green meat,' answered Dan from the box, where he sat in state like a\nchief among his tribe, with the great hound at his feet.\n\nThe girls began to clear up, but made little headway; for everything\nthey touched had a story, and all were thrilling, comical, or wild; so\nthey found it hard to settle to their work, till Dan was carried off by\nMr Laurie.\n\nThis was the beginning of the summer holiday, and it was curious to see\nwhat a pleasant little stir Dan's and Emil's coming made in the quiet\nlife of the studious community; for they seemed to bring a fresh breeze\nwith them that enlivened everyone. Many of the collegians remained\nduring vacation; and Plumfield and Parnassus did their best to make\nthese days pleasant for them, since most came from distant States, were\npoor, and had few opportunities but this for culture or amusement. Emil\nwas hail-fellow-well-met with men and maids, and went rollicking\nabout in true sailor fashion; but Dan stood rather in awe of the 'fair\ngirl-graduates', and was silent when among them, eyeing them as an eagle\nmight a flock of doves. He got on better with the young men, and was\ntheir hero at once. Their admiration for his manly accomplishments did\nhim good; because he felt his educational defects keenly, and often\nwondered if he could find anything in books to satisfy him as thoroughly\nas did the lessons he was learning from Nature's splendidly illustrated\nvolume. In spite of his silence, the girls found out his good qualities,\nand regarded 'the Spaniard', as they named him, with great favour;\nfor his black eyes were more eloquent than his tongue, and the kind\ncreatures tried to show their friendly interests in many charming ways.\n\nHe saw this, and endeavoured to be worthy of it--curbing his free\nspeech, toning down his rough manners, and watching the effect of all he\nsaid and did, anxious to make a good impression. The social atmosphere\nwarmed his lonely heart, the culture excited him to do his best, and the\nchanges which had taken place during his absence, both in himself and\nothers, made the old home seem like a new world. After the life in\nCalifornia, it was sweet and restful to be here, with these familiar\nfaces round him, helping him to forget much that he regretted, and to\nresolve to deserve more entirely the confidence of these good fellows,\nthe respect of these innocent girls.\n\nSo there was riding, rowing, and picnicking by day, music, dancing, and\nplays by night; and everyone said there had not been so gay a vacation\nfor years. Bess kept her promise, and let the dust gather on her beloved\nclay while she went pleasuring with her mates or studied music with her\nfather, who rejoiced over the fresh roses in her cheeks and the laughter\nwhich chased away the dreamy look she used to wear. Josie quarrelled\nless with Ted; for Dan had a way of looking at her which quelled her\ninstantly, and had almost as good an effect upon her rebellious cousin.\nBut Octoo did even more for the lively youth, who found that her charms\nentirely eclipsed those of the bicycle which had been his heart's\ndelight before. Early and late he rode this untiring beast, and began\nto gain flesh--to the great joy of his mother, who feared that her\nbeanstalk was growing too fast for health.\n\nDemi, finding business dull, solaced his leisure by photographing\neverybody he could induce to sit or stand to him, producing some\nexcellent pictures among many failures; for he had a pretty taste in\ngrouping, and endless patience. He might be said to view the world\nthrough the lens of his camera, and seemed to enjoy himself very much\nsquinting at his fellow beings from under a bit of black cambric. Dan\nwas a treasure to him; for he took well, and willingly posed in his\nMexican costume, with horse and hound, and all wanted copies of these\neffective photographs. Bess, also, was a favourite sitter; and Demi\nreceived a prize at the Amateur Photographic Exhibition for one of his\ncousin with all her hair about her face, which rose from the cloud of\nwhite lace draping the shoulders. These were freely handed round by the\nproud artist; and one copy had a tender little history yet to be told.\n\nNat was snatching every minute he could get with Daisy before the long\nparting; and Mrs Meg relented somewhat, feeling sure that absence would\nquite cure this unfortunate fancy. Daisy said little; but her gentle\nface was sad when she was alone, and a few quiet tears dropped on the\nhandkerchiefs she marked so daintily with her own hair. She was sure Nat\nwould not forget her; and life looked rather forlorn without the\ndear fellow who had been her friend since the days of patty-pans and\nconfidences in the willow-tree. She was an old-fashioned daughter,\ndutiful and docile, with such love and reverence for her mother that her\nwill was law; and if love was forbidden, friendship must suffice. So she\nkept her little sorrow to herself, smiled cheerfully at Nat, and made\nhis last days of home-life very happy with every comfort and pleasure\nshe could give, from sensible advice and sweet words to a well-filled\nwork-bag for his bachelor establishment and a box of goodies for the\nvoyage.\n\nTom and Nan took all the time they could spare from their studies to\nenjoy high jinks at Plumfield with their old friends; for Emil's next\nvoyage was to be a long one, Nat's absence was uncertain, and no one\never knew when Dan would turn up again. They all seemed to feel that\nlife was beginning to grow serious; and even while they enjoyed those\nlovely summer days together they were conscious that they were children\nno longer, and often in the pauses of their fun talked soberly of their\nplans and hopes, as if anxious to know and help one another before they\ndrifted farther apart on their different ways.\n\nA few weeks were all they had; then the Brenda was ready, Nat was to\nsail from New York, and Dan went along to see him off; for his own plans\nfermented in his head, and he was eager to be up and doing. A farewell\ndance was given on Parnassus in honour of the travellers, and all turned\nout in their best array and gayest spirits. George and Dolly came with\nthe latest Harvard airs and graces, radiant to behold, in dress-suits\nand 'crushed hats', as Josie called the especial pride and joy of their\nboyish souls. Jack and Ned sent regrets and best wishes, and no one\nmourned their absence; for they were among what Mrs Jo called her\nfailures. Poor Tom got into trouble, as usual, by deluging his head with\nsome highly scented preparation in the vain hope of making his tight\ncurls lie flat and smooth, as was the style. Unhappily, his rebellious\ncrop only kinked the closer, and the odour of many barbers' shops clung\nto him in spite of his frantic efforts to banish it. Nan wouldn't allow\nhim near her, and flapped her fan vigorously whenever he was in sight;\nwhich cut him to the heart, and made him feel like the Peri shut out\nfrom Paradise. Of course his mates jeered at him, and nothing but the\nunquenchable jollity of his nature kept him from despair.\n\nEmil was resplendent in his new uniform, and danced with an abandon\nwhich only sailors know. His pumps seemed to be everywhere, and his\npartners soon lost breath trying to keep up with him; but the girls\nall declared he steered like an angel, and in spite of his pace no\ncollisions took place; so he was happy, and found no lack of damsels to\nship with him.\n\nHaving no dress-suit, Dan had been coaxed to wear his Mexican costume,\nand feeling at ease in the many-buttoned trousers, loose jacket, and gay\nsash, flung his serape over his shoulder with a flourish and looked\nhis best, doing great execution with his long spurs, as he taught Josie\nstrange steps or rolled his black eyes admiringly after certain blonde\ndamsels whom he dared not address.\n\nThe mammas sat in the alcove, supplying pins, smiles, and kindly words\nto all, especially the awkward youths new to such scenes, and the\nbashful girls conscious of faded muslins and cleaned gloves. It was\npleasant to see stately Mrs Amy promenade on the arm of a tall country\nboy, with thick boots and a big forehead, or Mrs Jo dance like a girl\nwith a shy fellow whose arms went like pump-handles, and whose face was\nscarlet with confusion and pride at the honour of treading on the toes\nof the president's wife. Mrs Meg always had room on her sofa for two\nor three girls, and Mr Laurie devoted himself to these plain, poorly\ndressed damsels with a kindly grace that won their hearts and made them\nhappy. The good Professor circulated like refreshments, and his cheerful\nface shone on all alike, while Mr March discussed Greek comedy in the\nstudy with such serious gentlemen as never unbent their mighty minds to\nfrivolous joys.\n\nThe long music-room, parlour, hall, and piazza were full of white-gowned\nmaidens with attendant shadows; the air was full of lively voices,\nand hearts and feet went lightly together as the home band played\nvigorously, and the friendly moon did her best to add enchantment to the\nscene.\n\n'Pin me up, Meg; that dear Dunbar boy has nearly rent me \"in sunder\", as\nMr Peggotty would say. But didn't he enjoy himself, bumping against his\nfellow men and swinging me round like a mop. On these occasions I find\nthat I'm not as young as I was, nor as light of foot. In ten years more\nwe shall be meal-bags, sister; so be resigned.' And Mrs Jo subsided into\na corner, much dishevelled by her benevolent exertions.\n\n'I know I shall be stout; but you won't keep still long enough to get\nmuch flesh on your bones, dear; and Amy will always keep her lovely\nfigure. She looks about eighteen tonight, in her white gown and roses,'\nanswered Meg, busily pinning up one sister's torn frills, while her eyes\nfondly followed the other's graceful movements; for Meg still adored Amy\nin the old fashion.\n\nIt was one of the family jokes that Jo was getting fat, and she kept it\nup, though as yet she had only acquired a matronly outline, which was\nvery becoming. They were laughing over the impending double chins, when\nMr Laurie came off duty for a moment.\n\n'Repairing damages as usual, Jo? You never could take a little gentle\nexercise without returning in rags. Come and have a quiet stroll with me\nand cool off before supper. I've a series of pretty tableaux to show\nyou while Meg listens to the raptures of lisping Miss Carr, whom I made\nhappy by giving her Demi for a partner.'\n\nAs he spoke, Laurie led Jo to the music-room, nearly empty now after a\ndance which sent the young people into garden and hall. Pausing before\nthe first of the four long windows that opened on a very wide piazza, he\npointed to a group outside, saying: 'The name of this is \"Jack Ashore\".'\n\nA pair of long, blue legs, ending in very neat pumps, hung from the\nveranda roof among the vines; and roses, gathered by unseen hands,\nevidently appertaining to aforesaid legs, were being dropped into the\nlaps of several girls perched like a flock of white birds on the railing\nbelow; while a manly voice 'fell like a falling star', as it sung this\npensive ditty to a most appreciative audience:\n\n             MARY'S DREAM\n\n    The moon had climbed the eastern hill\n    Which rises o'er the sands of Dee,\n    And from its highest summit shed\n    A silver light on tower and tree,\n    When Mary laid her down to sleep\n    (Her thoughts on Sandy far at sea);\n    When soft and low a voice was heard,\n    Saying, 'Mary, weep no more for me.'\n\n    She from her pillow gently raised\n    Her head, to see who there might be,\n    And saw young Sandy, shivering stand\n    With visage pale and hollow e'e.\n    'Oh Mary dear, cold is my clay;\n    It lies beneath the stormy sea;\n    Far, far from thee, I sleep in death.\n    Dear Mary, weep no more for me.\n\n    'Three stormy nights and stormy days\n    We tossed upon the raging main.\n    And long we strove our bark to save;\n    But all our striving was in vain.\n    E'en then, when terror chilled my blood,\n    My heart was filled with love of thee.\n    The storm is past, and I'm at rest;\n    So, Mary, weep no more for me.\n\n    'Oh maiden dear, yourself prepare;\n    We soon shall meet upon that shore\n    Where love is free from doubt and care,\n    And you and I shall part no more.'\n    Loud crew the cock, the shadow fled;\n    No more her Sandy did she see;\n    But soft the passing spirit said,\n    'Sweet Mary, weep no more for me.'\n\n'The constant jollity of that boy is worth a fortune to him. He'll never\nsink with such a buoyant spirit to keep him afloat through life,' said\nMrs Jo, as the roses were tossed back with much applause when the song\nended.\n\n'Not he; and it's a blessing to be grateful for, isn't it? We moody\npeople know its worth. Glad you like my first tableau. Come and see\nnumber two. Hope it isn't spoilt; it was very pretty just now. This is\n\"Othello telling his adventures to Desdemona\".'\n\nThe second window framed a very picturesque group of three. Mr March in\nan arm-chair, with Bess on a cushion at his feet, was listening to Dan,\nwho, leaning against a pillar, was talking with unusual animation. The\nold man was in shadow, but little Desdemona was looking up with the\nmoonlight full upon her into young Othello's face, quite absorbed in the\nstory he was telling so well. The gay drapery over Dan's shoulder,\nhis dark colouring, and the gesture of his arm made the picture very\nstriking, and both spectators enjoyed it with silent pleasure, till Mrs\nJo said in a quick whisper:\n\n'I'm glad he's going away. He's too picturesque to have here among so\nmany romantic girls. Afraid his \"grand, gloomy, and peculiar\" style will\nbe too much for our simple maids.'\n\n'No danger; Dan is in the rough as yet, and always will be, I fancy;\nthough he is improving in many ways. How well Queenie looks in that soft\nlight!'\n\n'Dear little Goldilocks looks well everywhere.' And with a backward\nglance full of pride and fondness, Mrs Jo went on. But that scene\nreturned to her long afterward and her own prophetic words also.\n\nNumber three was a tragical tableau at first sight; and Mr Laurie\nstifled a laugh as he whispered 'The Wounded Knight', pointing to Tom\nwith his head enveloped in a large handkerchief, as he knelt before Nan,\nwho was extracting a thorn or splinter from the palm of his hand\nwith great skill, to judge from the patient's blissful expression of\ncountenance.\n\n'Do I hurt you?' she asked, turning the hand to the moonlight for a\nbetter view.\n\n'Not a bit; dig away; I like it,' answered Tom, regardless of his aching\nknees and the damage done to his best trousers.\n\n'I won't keep you long.'\n\n'Hours, if you please. Never so happy as here.'\n\nQuite unmoved by this tender remark, Nan put on a pair of large,\nround-eyed glasses, saying in a matter-of-fact tone: 'Now I see it. Only\na splinter, and there it is.\n\n'My hand is bleeding; won't you bind it up?' asked Tom, wishing to\nprolong the situation.\n\n'Nonsense; suck it. Only take care of it tomorrow if you dissect. Don't\nwant any more blood-poisoning.'\n\n'That was the only time you were kind to me. Wish I'd lost my arm.'\n\n'I wish you'd lost your head; it smells more like turpentine and\nkerosene than ever. Do take a run in the garden and air it.'\n\nFearing to betray themselves by laughter, the watchers went on, leaving\nthe Knight to rush away in despair, and the Lady to bury her nose in the\ncup of a tall lily for refreshment.\n\n'Poor Tom, his fate is a hard one, and he's wasting his time! Do advise\nhim to quit philandering and go to work, Jo.'\n\n'I have, Teddy, often; but it will take some great shock to make that\nboy wise. I wait with interest to see what it will be. Bless me! what is\nall this?'\n\nShe might well ask; for on a rustic stool stood Ted trying to pose on\none foot, with the other extended, and both hands waving in the air.\nJosie, with several young mates, was watching his contortions with deep\ninterest as they talked about 'little wings', 'gilded wire twisted', and\na 'cunning skull-cap'.\n\n'This might be called \"Mercury Trying to Fly\",' said Mr Laurie, as they\npeeped through the lace curtains.\n\n'Bless the long legs of that boy! how does he expect to manage them?\nThey are planning for the Owlsdark Marbles, and a nice muddle they will\nmake of my gods and goddesses with no one to show them how,' answered\nMrs Jo, enjoying this scene immensely. 'Now, he's got it!' 'That's\nperfectly splendid!' 'See how long you can keep so!' cried the girls, as\nTed managed to maintain his equilibrium a moment by resting one toe\non the trellis. Unfortunately this brought all his weight on the other\nfoot; the straw seat of the stool gave way, and the flying Mercury\ncame down with a crash, amid shrieks of laughter from the girls. Being\naccustomed to ground and lofty tumbling, he quickly recovered himself,\nand hopped gaily about, with one leg through the stool as he improvised\na classic jig.\n\n'Thanks for four nice little pictures. You have given me an idea, and I\nthink some time we will get up regular tableaux of this sort and march\nour company round a set of dissolving views. New and striking; I'll\npropose it to our manager and give you all the glory,' said Mrs Jo, as\nthey strolled towards the room whence came the clash of glass and china,\nand glimpses of agitated black coats.\n\nLet us follow the example of our old friends and stroll about among the\nyoung people, eavesdropping, so gathering up various little threads to\nhelp in the weaving of the story. George and Dolly were at supper,\nand having served the ladies in their care stood in a corner absorbing\nnourishment of all kinds with a vain attempt to conceal hearty appetites\nunder an air of elegant indifference.\n\n'Good spread, this; Laurence does things in style. First-rate coffee,\nbut no wine, and that's a mistake,' said Stuffy, who still deserved his\nname, and was a stout youth with a heavy eye and bilious complexion.\n\n'Bad for boys, he says. Jove! wish he could see us at some of our wines.\nDon't we just \"splice the main brace\" as Emil says,' answered Dolly,\nthe dandy, carefully spreading a napkin over the glossy expanse of\nshirt-front whereon a diamond stud shone like a lone star. His stutter\nwas nearly outgrown; but he, as well as George, spoke in the tone of\ncondescension, which, with the blase airs they assumed, made a very\nfunny contrast to their youthful faces and foolish remarks. Good-hearted\nlittle fellows both, but top-heavy with the pride of being Sophs and the\nfreedom that college life gave them.\n\n'Little Jo is getting to be a deuced pretty girl, isn't she?' said\nGeorge, with a long sigh of satisfaction as his first mouthful of ice\nwent slowly down his throat.\n\n'H'm--well, fairish. The Princess is rather more to my taste. I like 'em\nblonde and queenly and elegant, don't you know.'\n\n'Yes, Jo is too lively; might as well dance with a grasshopper.\nI've tried her, and she's one too many for me. Miss Perry is a nice,\neasy-going girl. Got her for the german.'\n\n'You'll never be a dancing man. Too lazy. Now I'll undertake to steer\nany girl and dance down any fellow you please. Dancing's my forte.' And\nDolly glanced from his trim feet to his flashing gem with the defiant\nair of a young turkey-cock on parade.\n\n'Miss Grey is looking for you. Wants more grub. Just see if Miss\nNelson's plate is empty, there's a good fellow. Can't eat ice in a\nhurry.' And George remained in his safe corner, while Dolly struggled\nthrough the crowd to do his duty, coming back in a fume, with a splash\nof salad dressing on his coat-cuff.\n\n'Confound these country chaps! they go blundering round like so many\ndor-bugs, and make a deuce of a mess. Better stick to books and not try\nto be society men. Can't do it. Beastly stain. Give it a rub, and let me\nbolt a mouthful, I'm starved. Never saw girls eat such a lot. It proves\nthat they ought not to study so much. Never liked co-ed,' growled Dolly,\nmuch ruffled in spirit.\n\n'So they do. 'Tisn't ladylike. Ought to be satisfied with an ice and\na bit of cake, and eat it prettily. Don't like to see a girl feed. We\nhard-working men need it, and, by Jove, I mean to get some more of that\nmeringue if it's not all gone. Here, waiter! bring along that dish over\nthere, and be lively,' commanded Stuffy, poking a young man in a rather\nshabby dress-suit, who was passing with a tray of glasses.\n\nHis order was obeyed promptly; but George's appetite was taken away\nthe next moment by Dolly's exclaiming, as he looked up from his damaged\ncoat, with a scandalized face:\n\n'You've put your foot in it now, old boy! that's Morton, Mr Bhaer's\ncrack man. Knows everything, no end of a \"dig\", and bound to carry off\nall the honours. You won't hear the last of it in a hurry.' And Dolly\nlaughed so heartily that a spoonful of ice flew upon the head of a lady\nsitting below him, and got him into a scrape also.\n\nLeaving them to their despair, let us listen to the whispered chat of\ntwo girls comfortably seated in a recess waiting till their escorts were\nfed.\n\n'I do think the Laurences give lovely parties. Don't you enjoy them?'\nasked the younger, looking about her with the eager air of one unused to\nthis sort of pleasure.\n\n'Very much, only I never feel as if I was dressed right. My things\nseemed elegant at home, and I thought I'd be over over-dressed if\nanything; but I look countrified and dowdy here. No time or money to\nchange now, even if I knew how to do it,' answered the other, glancing\nanxiously at her bright pink silk grown, trimmed with cheap lace.\n\n'You must get Mrs Brooke to tell you how to fix your things. She was\nvery kind to me. I had a green silk, and it looked so cheap and horrid\nby the side of the nice dresses here I felt regularly unhappy about it,\nand asked her how much a dress like one Mrs Laurence had would cost.\nThat looked so simple and elegant I thought it wouldn't be costly; but\nit was India mull and Valenciennes lace, so, of course, I couldn't have\nit. Then Mrs Brooke said: \"Get some muslin to cover the green silk, and\nwear hops or some white flowers, instead of pink, in your hair, and you\nwill have a pretty suit.\" Isn't it lovely and becoming?' And Miss Burton\nsurveyed herself with girlish satisfaction; for a little taste had\nsoftened the harsh green, and hop-bells became her red hair better than\nroses.\n\n'It's sweet: I've been admiring it. I'll do mine so and ask about my\npurple one. Mrs Brooke has helped me to get rid of my headaches, and\nMary Clay's dyspepsia is all gone since she gave up coffee and hot\nbread.'\n\n'Mrs Laurence advised me to walk and run and use the gymnasium to cure\nmy round shoulders and open my chest, and I'm a much better figure than\nI was.'\n\n'Did you know that Mr Laurence pays all Amelia Merrill's bills? Her\nfather failed, and she was heartbroken at having to leave college; but\nthat splendid man just stepped in and made it all right.' 'Yes, and\nProfessor Bhaer has several of the boys down at his house evenings to\nhelp them along so they can keep up with the rest; and Mrs Bhaer took\ncare of Charles Mackey herself when he had a fever last year. I do think\nthey are the best and kindest people in the world.'\n\n'So do I, and my time here will be the happiest and most useful years of\nmy life.'\n\nAnd both girls forgot their gowns and their suppers for a moment to look\nwith grateful, affectionate eyes at the friends who tried to care for\nbodies and for souls as well as minds.\n\nNow come to a lively party supping on the stairs, girls like foam at\nthe top, and a substratum of youths below, where the heaviest particles\nalways settle. Emil, who never sat if he could climb or perch, adorned\nthe newel-post; Tom, Nat, Demi, and Dan were camped on the steps, eating\nbusily, as their ladies were well served and they had earned a moment's\nrest, which they enjoyed with their eyes fixed on the pleasing prospect\nabove them.\n\n'I'm so sorry the boys are going. It will be dreadfully dull without\nthem. Now they have stopped teasing and are polite, I really enjoy\nthem,' said Nan, who felt unusually gracious tonight as Tom's mishap\nkept him from annoying her.\n\n'So do I; and Bess was mourning about it today, though as a general\nthing she doesn't like boys unless they are models of elegance. She has\nbeen doing Dan's head, and it is not quite finished. I never saw her so\ninterested in any work, and it's very well done. He is so striking and\nbig he always makes me think of the Dying Gladiator or some of those\nantique creatures. There's Bess now. Dear child, how sweet she looks\ntonight!' answered Daisy, waving her hand as the Princess went by with\nGrandpa on her arm.\n\n'I never thought he would turn out so well. Don't you remember how we\nused to call him \"the bad boy\" and be sure he would become a pirate or\nsomething awful because he glared at us and swore sometimes? Now he is\nthe handsomest of all the boys, and very entertaining with his stories\nand plans. I like him very much; he's so big and strong and independent.\nI'm tired of mollycoddles and book-worms,' said Nan in her decided way.\n\n'Not handsomer that Nat!' cried loyal Daisy, contrasting two faces\nbelow, one unusually gay, the other sentimentally sober even in the\nact of munching cake. 'I like Dan, and am glad he is doing well; but\nhe tires me, and I'm still a little afraid of him. Quiet people suit me\nbest.'\n\n'Life is a fight, and I like a good soldier. Boys take things too\neasily, don't see how serious it all is and go to work in earnest. Look\nat that absurd Tom, wasting his time and making an object of himself\njust because he can't have what he wants, like a baby crying for the\nmoon. I've no patience with such nonsense,' scolded Nan, looking down at\nthe jovial Thomas, who was playfully putting macaroons in Emil's shoes,\nand trying to beguile his exile as best he could.\n\n'Most girls would be touched by such fidelity. I think it's beautiful,'\nsaid Daisy behind her fan; for other girls sat just below.\n\n'You are a sentimental goose and not a judge. Nat will be twice the man\nwhen he comes back after his trip. I wish Tom was going with him. My\nidea is that if we girls have any influence we should use it for the\ngood of these boys, and not pamper them up, making slaves of ourselves\nand tyrants of them. Let them prove what they can do and be before they\nask anything of us, and give us a chance to do the same. Then we know\nwhere we are, and shall not make mistakes to mourn over all our lives.'\n\n'Hear, hear!' cried Alice Heath, who was a girl after Nan's own heart,\nand had chosen a career, like a brave and sensible young woman. 'Only\ngive us a chance, and have patience till we can do our best. Now we are\nexpected to be as wise as men who have had generations of all the help\nthere is, and we scarcely anything. Let us have equal opportunities, and\nin a few generations we will see what the judgement is. I like justice,\nand we get very little of it.'\n\n'Still shouting the battle-cry of freedom?' asked Demi, peering through\nthe banisters at this moment. 'Up with your flag! I'll stand by and lend\na hand if you want it. With you and Nan to lead the van, I think you\nwon't need much help.'\n\n'You are a great comfort, Demi, and I'll call on you in all emergencies;\nfor you are an honest boy, and don't forget that you owe much to your\nmother and your sisters and your aunts,' continued Nan. 'I do like men\nwho come out frankly and own that they are not gods. How can we think\nthem so when such awful mistakes are being made all the time by these\ngreat creatures? See them sick, as I do, then you know them.'\n\n'Don't hit us when we are down; be merciful, and set us up to bless and\nbelieve in you evermore,' pleaded Demi from behind the bars.\n\n'We'll be kind to you if you will be just to us. I don't say generous,\nonly just. I went to a suffrage debate in the Legislature last winter;\nand of all the feeble, vulgar twaddle I ever heard, that was the worst;\nand those men were our representatives. I blushed for them, and the\nwives and mothers. I want an intelligent man to represent me, if I can't\ndo it myself, not a fool.'\n\n'Nan is on the stump. Now we shall catch it,' cried Tom, putting up\nan umbrella to shield his unhappy head; for Nan's earnest voice was\naudible, and her indignant eye happened to rest on him as she spoke.\n\n'Go on, go on! I'll take notes, and put in \"great applause\" liberally,'\nadded Demi, producing his ball-book and pencil, with his Jenkins air.\n\nDaisy pinched his nose through the bars, and the meeting was rather\ntumultuous for a moment, for Emil called: 'Avast, avast, here's a squall\nto wind'ard'; Tom applauded wildly; Dan looked up as if the prospect of\na fight, even with words, pleased him, and Nat went to support Demi,\nas his position seemed to be a good one. At this crisis, when everyone\nlaughed and talked at once, Bess came floating through the upper hall\nand looked down like an angel of peace upon the noisy group below, as\nshe asked, with wondering eyes and smiling lips:\n\n'What is it?'\n\n'An indignation meeting. Nan and Alice are on the rampage, and we are at\nthe bar to be tried for our lives. Will Your Highness preside and judge\nbetween us?' answered Demi, as a lull at once took place; for no one\nrioted in the presence of the Princess.\n\n'I'm not wise enough. I'll sit here and listen. Please go on.' And Bess\ntook her place above them all as cool and calm as a little statue of\nJustice, with fan and nosegay in place of sword and scales.\n\n'Now, ladies, free your minds, only spare us till morning; for we've\ngot a german to dance as soon as everyone is fed, and Parnassus expects\nevery man to do his duty. Mrs President Giddy-gaddy has the floor,'\nsaid Demi, who liked this sort of fun better than the very mild sort of\nflirtation which was allowed at Plumfield, for the simple reason that it\ncould not be entirely banished, and is a part of all education, co- or\notherwise.\n\n'I have only one thing to say, and it is this,' began Nan soberly,\nthough her eyes sparkled with a mixture of fun and earnestness. 'I want\nto ask every boy of you what you really think on this subject. Dan and\nEmil have seen the world and ought to know their own minds. Tom and Nat\nhave had five examples before them for years. Demi is ours and we are\nproud of him. So is Rob. Ted is a weathercock, and Dolly and George,\nof course, are fogies in spite of the Annex, and girls at Girton going\nahead of the men. Commodore, are you ready for the question?'\n\n'Ay, ay, skipper.'\n\n'Do you believe in Woman's Suffrage?'\n\n'Bless your pretty figger head! I do, and I'll ship a crew of girls any\ntime you say so. Aren't they worse than a press-gang to carry a fellow\nout of his moorings? Don't we all need one as pilot to steer us safe to\nport? and why shouldn't they share our mess afloat and ashore since we\nare sure to be wrecked without 'em?'\n\n'Good for you, Emil! Nan will take you for first mate after that\nhandsome speech,' said Demi, as the girls applauded, and Tom glowered.\n'Now, Dan, you love liberty so well yourself, are you willing we should\nhave it?'\n\n'All you can get, and I'll fight any man who's mean enough to say you\ndon't deserve it.'\n\nThis brief and forcible reply delighted the energetic President, and she\nbeamed upon the member from California, as she said briskly:\n\n'Nat wouldn't dare to say he was on the other side even if he were, but\nI hope he has made up his mind to pipe for us, at least when we take the\nfield, and not be one of those who wait till the battle is won, and then\nbeat the drums and share the glory.'\n\nMrs Giddy-gaddy's doubts were most effectually removed, and her sharp\nspeech regretted, as Nat looked up blushing, but with a new sort of\nmanliness in face and manner, saying, in a tone that touched them all:\n\n'I should be the most ungrateful fellow alive if I did not love,\nhonour, and serve women with all my heart and might, for to them I owe\neverything I am or ever shall be.'\n\nDaisy clapped her hands, and Bess threw her bouquet into Nat's lap,\nwhile the other girls waved their fans, well pleased; for real feeling\nmade his little speech eloquent.\n\n'Thomas B. Bangs, come into court, and tell the truth, the whole truth,\nand nothing but the truth, if you can,' commanded Nan, with a rap to\ncall the meeting to order.\n\nTom shut the umbrella, and standing up raised his hand, saying solemnly:\n\n'I believe in suffrage of all kinds. I adore all women, and will die for\nthem at any moment if it will help the cause.'\n\n'Living and working for it is harder, and therefore more honourable. Men\nare always ready to die for us, but not to make our lives worth having.\nCheap sentiment and bad logic. You will pass, Tom, only don't twaddle.\nNow, having taken the sense of the meeting we will adjourn, as the hour\nfor festive gymnastics has arrived. I am glad to see that old Plum\nhas given six true men to the world, and hope they will continue to be\nstaunch to her and the principles she has taught them, wherever they may\ngo. Now, girls, don't sit in draughts, and, boys, beware of ice-water\nwhen you are warm.'\n\nWith this characteristic close Nan retired from office, and the girls\nwent to enjoy one of the few rights allowed them.\n\n\n\nChapter 6. LAST WORDS\n\nThe next day was Sunday, and a goodly troop of young and old set forth\nto church.--some driving, some walking, all enjoying the lovely weather\nand the happy quietude which comes to refresh us when the work and worry\nof the week are over. Daisy had a headache; and Aunt Jo remained at home\nto keep her company, knowing very well that the worst ache was in the\ntender heart struggling dutifully against the love that grew stronger as\nthe parting drew nearer.\n\n'Daisy knows my wishes, and I trust her. You must keep an eye on Nat,\nand let him clearly understand that there is to be no \"lovering\", or\nI shall forbid the letter-writing. I hate to seem cruel, but it is too\nsoon for my dear girl to bind herself in any way,' said Mrs Meg, as she\nrustled about in her best grey silk, while waiting for Demi, who always\nescorted his pious mother to church as a peace-offering for crossing her\nwishes in other things.\n\n'I will, dear; I'm lying in wait for all three boys today, like an old\nspider; and I will have a good talk with each. They know I understand\nthem, and they always open their hearts sooner or later. You look like a\nnice, plump little Quakeress, Meg; and no one will believe that big\nboy is your son,' added Mrs Jo, as Demi came in shining with Sunday\nneatness, from his well-blacked boots to his smooth brown head.\n\n'You flatter me, to soften my heart toward your boy. I know your ways,\nJo, and I don't give in. Be firm, and spare me a scene by and by. As for\nJohn, as long as he is satisfied with his old mother, I don't care what\npeople think,' answered Mrs Meg, accepting with a smile the little posy\nof sweet peas and mignonette Demi brought her.\n\nThen, having buttoned her dove-coloured gloves with care, she took her\nson's arm and went proudly away to the carriage, where Amy and Bess\nwaited, while Jo called after them, just as Marmee used to do:\n\n'Girls, have you got nice pocket-handkerchiefs?' They all smiled at\nthe familiar words, and three white banners waved as they drove away,\nleaving the spider to watch for her first fly. She did not wait long.\nDaisy was lying down with a wet cheek on the little hymnbook out of\nwhich she and Nat used to sing together; so Mrs Jo strolled about\nthe lawn, looking very like a wandering mushroom with her large buff\numbrella.\n\nDan had gone for a ten-mile stroll; and Nat was supposed to have\naccompanied him, but presently came sneaking back, unable to tear\nhimself away from the Dovecote or lose a moment of nearness to his idol\nthat last day. Mrs Jo saw him at once, and beckoned him to a rustic seat\nunder the old elm, where they could have their confidences undisturbed,\nand both keep an eye on a certain white-curtained window, half hidden in\nvines.\n\n'Nice and cool here. I'm not up to one of Dan's tramps today--it's so\nwarm, and he goes so like a steam-engine. He headed for the swamp where\nhis pet snakes used to live, and I begged to be excused,' said Nat,\nfanning himself with his straw hat, though the day was not oppressive.\n\n'I'm glad you did. Sit and rest with me, and have one of our good old\ntalks. We've both been so busy lately, I feel as if I didn't half know\nyour plans; and I want to,' answered Mrs Jo, feeling sure that though\nthey might start with Leipzig they would bring up at Plumfield.\n\n'You are very kind, and there's nothing I'd like better. I don't realize\nI'm going so far--suppose I shan't till I get afloat. It's a splendid\nstart, and I don't know how I can ever thank Mr Laurie for all he's\ndone, or you either,' added Nat, with a break in his voice; for he was a\ntender-hearted fellow, and never forgot a kindness.\n\n'You can thank us beautifully by being and doing all we hope and expect\nof you, my dear. In the new life you are going to there will be a\nthousand trials and temptations, and only your own wit and wisdom to\nrely on. That will be the time to test the principles we have tried\nto give you, and see how firm they are. Of course, you will make\nmistakes--we all do; but don't let go of your conscience and drift along\nblindly. Watch and pray, dear Nat; and while your hand gains skill, let\nyour head grow wiser, and keep your heart as innocent and warm as it is\nnow.'\n\n'I'll try, Mother Bhaer, my very best to be a credit to you. I know I\nshall improve in my music--can't help it there; but I never shall be\nvery wise, I'm afraid. As for my heart, you know, I leave it behind me\nin good keeping.'\n\nAs he spoke, Nat's eyes were fixed on the window with a look of love and\nlonging that made his quiet face both manly and sad--plainly showing how\nstrong a hold this boyish affection had upon him.\n\n'I want to speak of that; and I know you will forgive what seems hard,\nbecause I do most heartily sympathize with you,' said Mrs Jo, glad to\nhave her say.\n\n'Yes, do talk about Daisy! I think of nothing but leaving and losing\nher. I have no hope--I suppose it is too much to ask; only I can't help\nloving her, wherever I am!' cried Nat, with a mixture of defiance and\ndespair in his face that rather startled Mrs Jo.\n\n'Listen to me and I'll try to give you both comfort and good advice. We\nall know that Daisy is fond of you, but her mother objects, and being a\ngood girl she tries to obey. Young people think they never can change,\nbut they do in the most wonderful manner, and very few die of broken\nhearts.' Mrs Jo smiled as she remembered another boy whom she had once\ntried to comfort, and then went soberly on while Nat listened as if his\nfate hung upon her lips.\n\n'One of two things will happen. You will find someone else to love,\nor, better still, be so busy and happy in your music that you will be\nwilling to wait for time to settle the matter for you both. Daisy will\nperhaps forget when you are gone, and be glad you are only friends. At\nany rate it is much wiser to have no promises made; then both are free,\nand in a year or two may meet to laugh over the little romance nipped in\nthe bud.'\n\n'Do you honestly think that?' asked Nat, looking at her so keenly that\nthe truth had to come; for all his heart was in those frank blue eyes of\nhis.\n\n'No, I don't!' answered Mrs Jo. 'Then if you were in my place, what\nwould you do?' he added, with a tone of command never heard in his\ngentle voice before.\n\n'Bless me! the boy is in dead earnest, and I shall forget prudence\nin sympathy I'm afraid,' thought Mrs Jo, surprised and pleased by the\nunexpected manliness Nat showed.\n\n'I'll tell you what I should do. I'd say to myself:\n\n\"I'll prove that my love is strong and faithful, and make Daisy's\nmother proud to give her to me by being not only a good musician but an\nexcellent man, and so command respect and confidence. This I will try\nfor; and if I fail, I shall be the better for the effort, and find\ncomfort in the thought that I did my best for her sake.\"'\n\n'That is what I meant to do. But I wanted a word of hope to give me\ncourage,' cried Nat, firing up as if the smouldering spark was set\nablaze by a breath of encouragement. 'Other fellows, poorer and stupider\nthan I, have done great things and come to honour. Why may not I, though\nI'm nothing now? I know Mrs Brooke remembers what I came from, but my\nfather was honest though everything went wrong; and I have nothing to\nbe ashamed of though I was a charity boy. I never will be ashamed of my\npeople or myself, and I'll make other folks respect me if I can.'\n\n'Good! that's the right spirit, Nat. Hold to it and make yourself a man.\nNo one will be quicker to see and admire the brave work than my sister\nMeg. She does not despise your poverty or your past; but mothers are\nvery tender over their daughters, and we Marches, though we have been\npoor, are, I confess, a little proud of our good family. We don't care\nfor money; but a long line of virtuous ancestors is something to desire\nand to be proud of.'\n\n'Well, the Blakes are a good lot. I looked 'em up, and not one was\never in prison, hanged, or disgraced in any way. We used to be rich and\nhonoured years ago, but we've died out and got poor, and father was a\nstreet musician rather than beg; and I'll be one again before I'll do\nthe mean things some men do and pass muster.'\n\nNat was so excited that Mrs Jo indulged in a laugh to calm him, and both\nwent on more quietly.\n\n'I told my sister all that and it pleased her. I am sure if you do well\nthese next few years that she will relent and all be happily settled,\nunless that wonderful change, which you don't believe possible, should\noccur. Now, cheer up; don't be lackadaisical and blue. Say good-bye\ncheerfully and bravely, show a manly front, and leave a pleasant memory\nbehind you. We all wish you well and hope much for you. Write to me\nevery week and I'll send a good, gossipy answer. Be careful what you\nwrite to Daisy; don't gush or wail, for sister Meg will see the letters;\nand you can help your cause very much by sending sensible, cheery\naccounts of your life to us all.'\n\n'I will; I will; it looks brighter and better already, and I won't lose\nmy one comfort by any fault of my own. Thank you so much, Mother Bhaer,\nfor taking my side. I felt so ungrateful and mean and crushed when I\nthought you all considered me a sneak who had no business to love such\na precious girl as Daisy. No one said anything, but I knew how you felt,\nand that Mr Laurie sent me off partly to get me out of the way. Oh dear,\nlife is pretty tough sometimes, isn't it?' And Nat took his head in both\nhands as if it ached with the confusion of hopes and fears, passions and\nplans that proved boyhood was past and manhood had begun.\n\n'Very tough, but it is that very struggle with obstacles which does us\ngood. Things have been made easy for you in many ways, but no one can do\neverything. You must paddle your own canoe now, and learn to avoid the\nrapids and steer straight to the port you want to reach. I don't know\njust what your temptations will be for you have no bad habits and seem\nto love music so well, nothing can lure you from it. I only hope you\nwon't work too hard.'\n\n'I feel as if I could work like a horse, I'm so eager to get on; but\nI'll take care. Can't waste time being sick, and you've given me doses\nenough to keep me all right, I guess.' Nat laughed as he remembered\nthe book of directions Mrs Jo had written for him to consult on all\noccasions.\n\nShe immediately added some verbal ones on the subject of foreign messes,\nand having mounted one of her pet hobbies, was in full gallop when Emil\nwas seen strolling about on the roof of the old house, that being his\nfavourite promenade; for there he could fancy himself walking the deck,\nwith only blue sky and fresh air about him.\n\n'I want a word with the Commodore, and up there we shall be nice and\nquiet. Go and play to Daisy: it will put her to sleep and do you both\ngood. Sit in the porch, so I can keep an eye on you as I promised'; and\nwith a motherly pat on the shoulder Mrs Jo left Nat to his delightful\ntask and briskly ascended to the house-top, not up the trellis as of old\nbut by means of the stairs inside.\n\nEmerging on the platform she found Emil cutting his initials afresh in\nthe wood-work and singing 'Pull for the Shore', like the tuneful mariner\nhe was.\n\n'Come aboard and make yourself at home, Aunty,' he said, with a playful\nsalute. 'I'm just leaving a P.P.C. in the old place, so when you fly up\nhere for refuge you'll remember me.'\n\n'Ah, my dear, I'm not likely to forget you. It doesn't need E. B. H. cut\non all the trees and railings to remind me of my sailor boy'; and Mrs Jo\ntook the seat nearest the blue figure astride the balustrade, not quite\nsure how to begin the little sermon she wanted to preach.\n\n'Well, you don't pipe your eye and look squally when I sheer off as you\nused to, and that's a comfort. I like to leave port in fair weather and\nhave a jolly send-off all round. Specially this time, for it will be a\nyear or more before we drop anchor here again,' answered Emil, pushing\nhis cap back, and glancing about him as if he loved old Plum and would\nbe sorry never to see it any more.\n\n'You have salt water enough without my adding to it. I'm going to be\nquite a Spartan mother, and send my sons to battle with no wailing, only\nthe command:\n\n\"With your shield or on it\",' said Mrs Jo cheerfully, adding after a\npause: 'I often wish I could go too, and some day I will, when you are\ncaptain and have a ship of your own--as I've no doubt you will before\nlong, with Uncle Herman to push you on.'\n\n'When I do I'll christen her the Jolly Jo and take you as first mate.\nIt would be regular larks to have you aboard, and I'd be a proud man to\ncarry you round the world you've wanted to see so long and never could,'\nanswered Emil, caught at once by this splendid vision.\n\n'I'll make my first voyage with you and enjoy myself immensely in spite\nof seasickness and all the stormy winds that blow. I've always thought\nI'd like to see a wreck, a nice safe one with all saved after great\ndanger and heroic deeds, while we clung like Mr Pillicoddy to main-top\njibs and lee scuppers.'\n\n'No wrecks yet, ma'am, but we'll try to accommodate customers. Captain\nsays I'm a lucky dog and bring fair weather, so we'll save the dirty\nweather for you if you want it,' laughed Emil, digging at the ship in\nfull sail which he was adding to his design.\n\n'Thanks, I hope you will. This long voyage will give you new\nexperiences, and being an officer, you will have new duties and\nresponsibilities. Are you ready for them? You take everything so gaily,\nI've been wondering if you realized that now you will have not only to\nobey but to command also, and power is a dangerous thing. Be careful\nthat you don't abuse it or let it make a tyrant of you.'\n\n'Right you are, ma'am. I've seen plenty of that, and have got my\nbearings pretty well, I guess. I shan't have very wide swing with Peters\nover me, but I'll see that the boys don't get abused when he's bowsed up\nhis jib. No right to speak before, but now I won't stand it.'\n\n'That sounds mysteriously awful; could I ask what nautical torture\n\"bowsing jibs\" is?' asked Mrs Jo, in a tone of deep interest.\n\n'Getting drunk. Peters can hold more grog than any man I ever saw; he\nkeeps right side up, but is as savage as a norther, and makes things\nlively all round. I've seen him knock a fellow down with a belaying pin,\nand couldn't lend a hand. Better luck now, I hope.' And Emil frowned as\nif he already trod the quarter-deck, lord of all he surveyed.\n\n'Don't get into trouble, for even Uncle Herman's favour won't cover\ninsubordination, you know. You have proved yourself a good sailor; now\nbe a good officer, which is a harder thing, I fancy. It takes a fine\ncharacter to rule justly and kindly; you will have to put by your boyish\nways and remember your dignity. That will be excellent training for you,\nEmil, and sober you down a bit. No more skylarking except here, so mind\nyour ways, and do honour to your buttons,' said Mrs Jo, tapping one\nof the very bright brass ones that ornamented the new suit Emil was so\nproud of.\n\n'I'll do my best. I know my time for skirmshander (chaff) is over, and\nI must steer a straighter course; but don't you fear, Jack ashore is a\nvery different craft from what he is with blue water under his keel. I\nhad a long talk with Uncle last night and got my orders; I won't forget\n'em nor all I owe him. As for you, I'll name my first ship as I say, and\nhave your bust for the figurehead, see if I don't,' and Emil gave his\naunt a hearty kiss to seal the vow, which proceeding much amused Nat,\nplaying softly in the porch of the Dovecote.\n\n'You do me proud, Captain. But, dear, I want to say one thing and then\nI'm done; for you don't need much advice of mine after my good man has\nspoken. I read somewhere that every inch of rope used in the British\nNavy has a strand of red in it, so that wherever a bit of it is found\nit is known. That is the text of my little sermon to you. Virtue, which\nmeans honour, honesty, courage, and all that makes character, is the\nred thread that marks a good man wherever he is. Keep that always and\neverywhere, so that even if wrecked by misfortune, that sign shall still\nbe found and recognized. Yours is a rough life, and your mates not all\nwe could wish, but you can be a gentleman in the true sense of the word;\nand no matter what happens to your body, keep your soul clean, your\nheart true to those who love you, and do your duty to the end.'\n\nAs she spoke Emil had risen and stood listening with his cap off and a\ngrave, bright look as if taking orders from a superior officer; when she\nended, he answered briefly, but heartily:\n\n'Please God, I will!'\n\n'That's all; I have little fear for you, but one never knows when or how\nthe weak moment may come, and sometimes a chance word helps us, as so\nmany my dear mother spoke come back to me now for my own comfort and the\nguidance of my boys,' said Mrs Jo, rising; for the words had been said\nand no more were needed.\n\n'I've stored 'em up and know where to find 'em when wanted. Often and\noften in my watch I've seen old Plum, and heard you and Uncle talking\nso plainly, I'd have sworn I was here. It is a rough life, Aunty, but\na wholesome one if a fellow loves it as I do, and has an anchor to\nwindward as I have. Don't worry about me, and I'll come home next year\nwith a chest of tea that will cheer your heart and give you ideas enough\nfor a dozen novels. Going below? All right, steady in the gangway! I'll\nbe along by the time you've got out the cake-box. Last chance for a good\nold lunch ashore.'\n\nMrs Jo descended laughing, and Emil finished his ship whistling\ncheerfully, neither dreaming when and where this little chat on the\nhouse-top would return to the memory of one of them.\n\nDan was harder to catch, and not until evening did a quiet moment come\nin that busy family; when, while the rest were roaming about, Mrs Jo sat\ndown to read in the study, and presently Dan looked in at the window.\n\n'Come and rest after your long tramp; you must be tired,' she called,\nwith an inviting nod towards the big sofa where so many boys had\nreposed--as much as that active animal ever does.\n\n'Afraid I shall disturb you'; but Dan looked as if he wanted to stay his\nrestless feet somewhere.\n\n'Not a bit; I'm always ready to talk, shouldn't be a woman if I were\nnot,' laughed Mrs Jo, as Dan swung himself in and sat down with an air\nof contentment very pleasant to see.\n\n'Last day is over, yet somehow I don't seem to hanker to be off.\nGenerally, I'm rather anxious to cut loose after a short stop. Odd,\nain't it?' asked Dan, gravely picking grass and leaves out of his hair\nand beard; for he had been lying on the grass, thinking many thoughts in\nthe quiet summer night.\n\n'Not at all; you are beginning to get civilized. It's a good sign, and\nI'm glad to see it,' answered Mrs Jo promptly. 'You've had your swing,\nand want a change. Hope the farming will give it to you, though helping\nthe Indians pleases me more: it is so much better to work for others\nthan for one's self alone.'\n\n'So 'tis,' assented Dan heartily. 'I seem to want to root somewhere\nand have folks of my own to take care of. Tired of my own company, I\nsuppose, now I've seen so much better. I'm a rough, ignorant lot, and\nI've been thinking maybe I've missed it loafing round creation, instead\nof going in for education as the other chaps did. Hey?'\n\nHe looked anxiously at Mrs Jo; and she tried to hide the surprise this\nnew outburst caused her; for till now Dan had scorned books and gloried\nin his freedom.\n\n'No; I don't think so in your case. So far I'm sure the free life was\nbest. Now that you are a man you can control that lawless nature better;\nbut as a boy only great activity and much adventure could keep you out\nof mischief. Time is taming my colt, you see, and I shall yet be proud\nof him, whether he makes a pack-horse of himself to carry help to the\nstarving or goes to ploughing as Pegasus did.'\n\nDan liked the comparison, and smiled as he lounged in the sofa-corner,\nwith the new thoughtfulness in his eyes.\n\n'Glad you think so. The fact is it's going to take a heap of taming to\nmake me go well in harness anywhere. I want to, and I try now and then,\nbut always kick over the traces and run away. No lives lost yet; but I\nshouldn't wonder if there was some time, and a general smash-up.'\n\n'Why, Dan, did you have any dangerous adventures during this last\nabsence? I fancied so, but didn't ask before, knowing you'd tell me if I\ncould help in any way. Can I?' And Mrs Jo looked anxiously at him; for a\nsudden lowering expression had come into his face, and he leaned forward\nas if to hide it.\n\n'Nothing very bad; but 'Frisco isn't just a heaven on earth, you know,\nand it's harder to be a saint there than here,' he answered slowly;\nthen, as if he had made up his mind to ''fess', as the children used to\nsay, he sat up, and added rapidly, in a half-defiant, half-shamefaced\nway, 'I tried gambling, and it wasn't good for me.'\n\n'Was that how you made your money?'\n\n'Not a penny of it! That's all honest, if speculation isn't a bigger\nsort of gambling. I won a lot; but I lost or gave it away, and cut the\nwhole concern before it got the better of me.'\n\n'Thank heaven for that! Don't try it again; it may have the terrible\nfascination for you it has for so many. Keep to your mountains and\nprairies, and shun cities, if these things tempt you, Dan. Better lose\nyour life than your soul, and one such passion leads to worse sins, as\nyou know better than I.'\n\nDan nodded, and seeing how troubled she was, said, in a lighter tone,\nthough still the shadow of that past experience remained:\n\n'Don't be scared; I'm all right now; and a burnt dog dreads the fire. I\ndon't drink, or do the things you dread; don't care for 'em; but I\nget excited, and then this devilish temper of mine is more than I can\nmanage. Fighting a moose or a buffalo is all right; but when you pitch\ninto a man, no matter how great a scamp he is, you've got to look out.\nI shall kill someone some day; that's all I'm afraid of. I do hate a\nsneak!' And Dan brought his fist down on the table with a blow that made\nthe lamp totter and the books skip.\n\n'That always was your trial, Dan, and I can sympathize with you; for\nI've been trying to govern my own temper all my life, and haven't learnt\nyet,' said Mrs Jo, with a sigh. 'For heaven's sake, guard your demon\nwell, and don't let a moment's fury ruin all your life. As I said to\nNat, watch and pray, my dear boy. There is no other help or hope for\nhuman weakness but God's love and patience.'\n\nTears were in Mrs Jo's eyes as she spoke; for she felt this deeply, and\nknew how hard a task it is to rule these bosom sins of ours. Dan looked\ntouched, also uncomfortable, as he always did when religion of any sort\nwas mentioned, though he had a simple creed of his own, and tried to\nlive up to it in his blind way.\n\n'I don't do much praying; don't seem to come handy to me; but I can\nwatch like a redskin, only it's easier to mount guard over a lurking\ngrizzly than my own cursed temper. It's that I'm afraid of, if I settle\ndown. I can get on with wild beasts first-rate; but men rile me awfully,\nand I can't take it out in a free fight, as I can with a bear or a\nwolf. Guess I'd better head for the Rockies, and stay there a spell\nlonger--till I'm tame enough for decent folks, if I ever am.' And Dan\nleaned his rough head on his hands in a despondent attitude.\n\n'Try my sort of help, and don't give up. Read more, study a little, and\ntry to meet a better class of people, who won't \"rile\", but soothe and\nstrengthen you. We don't make you savage, I'm sure; for you have been as\nmeek as a lamb, and made us very happy.'\n\n'Glad of it; but I've felt like a hawk in a hen-house all the same,\nand wanted to pounce and tear more than once. Not so much as I used,\nthough,' added Dan, after a short laugh at Mrs Jo's surprised face.\n'I'll try your plan, and keep good company this bout if I can; but a man\ncan't pick and choose, knocking about as I do.'\n\n'Yes, you can this time; for you are going on a peaceful errand and can\nkeep clear of temptation if you try. Take some books and read; that's\nan immense help; and books are always good company if you have the right\nsort. Let me pick out some for you.' And Mrs Jo made a bee-line to the\nwell-laden shelves, which were the joy of her heart and the comfort of\nher life.\n\n'Give me travels and stories, please; don't want any pious works, can't\nseem to relish 'em, and won't pretend I do,' said Dan, following to look\nover her head with small favour at the long lines of well-worn volumes.\n\nMrs Jo turned short round, and putting a hand on either broad shoulder,\nlooked him in the eye, saying soberly:\n\n'Now, Dan, see here; never sneer at good things or pretend to be worse\nthan you are. Don't let false shame make you neglect the religion\nwithout which no man can live. You needn't talk about it if you don't\nlike, but don't shut your heart to it in whatever shape it comes. Nature\nis your God now; she has done much for you; let her do more, and lead\nyou to know and love a wiser and more tender teacher, friend, and\ncomforter than she can ever be. That is your only hope; don't throw it\naway, and waste time; for sooner or later you will feel the need of Him,\nand He will come to you and hold you up when all other help fails.'\n\nDan stood motionless, and let her read in his softened eyes the dumb\ndesire that lived in his heart, though he had no words to tell it,\nand only permitted her to catch a glimpse of the divine spark which\nsmoulders or burns clearly in every human soul. He did not speak; and\nglad to be spared some answer which should belie his real feelings, Mrs\nJo hastened to say, with her most motherly smile:\n\n'I saw in your room the little Bible I gave you long ago; it was well\nworn outside, but fresh within, as if not much read. Will you promise me\nto read a little once a week, dear, for my sake? Sunday is a quiet day\neverywhere, and this book is never old nor out of place. Begin with the\nstories you used to love when I told them to you boys. David was your\nfavourite, you remember? Read him again; he'll suit you even better now,\nand you'll find his sins and repentance useful reading till you come to\nthe life and work of a diviner example than he. You will do it, for\nlove of mother Bhaer, who always loved her \"firebrand\" and hoped to save\nhim?'\n\n'I will,' answered Dan, with a sudden brightening of face that was like\na sunburst through a cloud, full of promise though so short-lived and\nrare.\n\nMrs Jo turned at once to the books and began to talk of them, knowing\nwell that Dan would not hear any more just then. He seemed relieved; for\nit was always hard for him to show his inner self, and he took pride in\nhiding it as an Indian does in concealing pain or fear.\n\n'Hallo, here's old Sintram! I remember him; used to like him and his\ntantrums, and read about 'em to Ted. There he is riding ahead with Death\nand the Devil alongside.'\n\nAs Dan looked at the little picture of the young man with horse and\nhound going bravely up the rocky defile, accompanied by the companions\nwho ride beside most men through this world, a curious impulse made Mrs\nJo say quickly:\n\n'That's you, Dan, just you at this time! Danger and sin are near you in\nthe life you lead; moods and passions torment you; the bad father left\nyou to fight alone, and the wild spirit drives you to wander up and down\nthe world looking for peace and self-control. Even the horse and hound\nare there, your Octoo and Don, faithful friends, unscared by the strange\nmates that go with you. You have not got the armour yet, but I'm trying\nto show you where to find it. Remember the mother Sintram loved and\nlonged to find, and did find when his battle was bravely fought, his\nreward well earned? You can recollect your mother; and I have always\nfelt that all the good qualities you possess come from her. Act out the\nbeautiful old story in this as in the other parts, and try to give her\nback a son to be proud of.'\n\nQuite carried away by the likeness of the quaint tale to Dan's life and\nneeds, Mrs Jo went on pointing to the various pictures which illustrated\nit, and when she looked up was surprised to see how struck and\ninterested he seemed to be. Like all people of his temperament he was\nvery impressionable, and his life among hunters and Indians had made him\nsuperstitious; he believed in dreams, liked weird tales, and whatever\nappealed to the eye or mind, vividly impressed him more than the wisest\nwords. The story of poor, tormented Sintram came back clearly as he\nlooked and listened, symbolizing his secret trials even more truly than\nMrs Jo knew; and just at that moment this had an effect upon him that\nnever was forgotten. But all he said was:\n\n'Small chance of that. I don't take much stock in the idea of meeting\nfolks in heaven. Guess mother won't remember the poor little brat she\nleft so long ago; why should she?'\n\n'Because true mothers never forget their children; and I know she was\none, from the fact that she ran away from the cruel husband, to save\nher little son from bad influences. Had she lived, life would have been\nhappier for you, with this tender friend to help and comfort you. Never\nforget that she risked everything for your sake, and don't let it be in\nvain.'\n\nMrs Jo spoke very earnestly, knowing that this was the one sweet memory\nof Dan's early life, and glad to have recalled it at this moment; for\nsuddenly a great tear splashed down on the page where Sintram kneels\nat his mother's feet, wounded, but victorious over sin and death. She\nlooked up, well pleased to have touched Dan to the heart's core, as that\ndrop proved; but a sweep of the arm brushed away the tell-tale, and his\nbeard hid the mate to it, as he shut the book, saying with a suppressed\nquiver in his strong voice:\n\n'I'll keep this, if nobody wants it. I'll read it over, and maybe it\nwill do me good. I'd like to meet her anywhere, but don't believe I ever\nshall.'\n\n'Keep it and welcome. My mother gave it to me; and when you read it try\nto believe that neither of your mothers will ever forget you.'\n\nMrs Jo gave the book with a caress; and simply saying: 'Thanks; good\nnight,' Dan thrust it into his pocket, and walked straight away to the\nriver to recover from this unwonted mood of tenderness and confidence.\n\nNext day the travellers were off. All were in good spirits, and a cloud\nof handkerchiefs whitened the air as they drove away in the old bus,\nwaving their hats to everyone and kissing their hands, especially to\nmother Bhaer, who said in her prophetic tone as she wiped her eyes, when\nthe familiar rumble died away:\n\n'I have a feeling that something is going to happen to some of them, and\nthey will never come back to me, or come back changed. Well, I can only\nsay, God be with my boys!'\n\nAnd He was.\n\n\n\nChapter 7. THE LION AND THE LAMB\n\nWhen the boys were gone a lull fell upon Plumfield, and the family\nscattered to various places for brief outings, as August had come and\nall felt the need of change. The Professor took Mrs Jo to the mountains.\nThe Laurences were at the seashore, and there Meg's family and the Bhaer\nboys took turns to visit, as someone must always be at home to keep\nthings in order.\n\nMrs Meg, with Daisy, was in office when the events occurred which we are\nabout to relate. Rob and Ted were just up from Rocky Nook, and Nan\nwas passing a week with her friend as the only relaxation she allowed\nherself. Demi was off on a run with Tom, so Rob was man of the house,\nwith old Silas as general overseer. The sea air seemed to have gone to\nTed's head, for he was unusually freakish, and led his gentle aunt and\npoor Rob a life of it with his pranks. Octoo was worn out with the wild\nrides he took, and Don openly rebelled when ordered to leap and show\noff his accomplishments; while the girls at college were both amused and\nworried by the ghosts who haunted the grounds at night, the unearthly\nmelodies that disturbed their studious hours, and the hairbreadth\nescapes of this restless boy by flood and field and fire. Something\nhappened at length which effectually sobered Ted and made a lasting\nimpression on both the boys; for sudden danger and a haunting fear\nturned the Lion into a lamb and the Lamb into a lion, as far as courage\nwent.\n\nOn the first of September--the boys never forgot the date--after a\npleasant tramp and good luck with their fishing, the brothers were\nlounging in the barn; for Daisy had company, and the lads kept out of\nthe way.\n\n'I tell you what it is, Bobby, that dog is sick. He won't play, nor eat,\nnor drink, and acts queerly. Dan will kill us if anything happens to\nhim,' said Ted, looking at Don, who lay near his kennel resting a moment\nafter one of the restless wanderings which kept him vibrating between\nthe door of Dan's room and the shady corner of the yard, where his\nmaster had settled him with an old cap to guard till he came back.\n\n'It's the hot weather, perhaps. But I sometimes think he's pining for\nDan. Dogs do, you know, and the poor fellow has been low in his mind\never since the boys went. Maybe something has happened to Dan. Don\nhowled last night and can't rest. I've heard of such things,' answered\nRob thoughtfully.\n\n'Pooh! he can't know. He's cross. I'll stir him up and take him for a\nrun. Always makes me feel better. Hi, boy! wake up and be jolly'; and\nTed snapped his fingers at the dog, who only looked at him with grim\nindifference.\n\n'Better let him alone. If he isn't right tomorrow, we'll take him to Dr\nWatkins and see what he says.' And Rob went on watching the swallows as\nhe lay in the hay polishing up some Latin verses he had made.\n\nThe spirit of perversity entered into Ted, and merely because he was\ntold not to tease Don he went on doing it, pretending that it was for\nthe dog's good. Don took no heed of his pats, commands, reproaches, or\ninsults, till Ted's patience gave out; and seeing a convenient switch\nnear by he could not resist the temptation to conquer the great hound\nby force, since gentleness failed to win obedience. He had the wisdom to\nchain Don up first; for a blow from any hand but his master's made him\nsavage, and Ted had more than once tried the experiment, as the dog\nremembered. This indignity roused Don and he sat up with a growl. Rob\nheard it, and seeing Ted raise the switch, ran to interfere, exclaiming:\n\n'Don't touch him! Dan forbade it! Leave the poor thing in peace; I won't\nallow it.'\n\nRob seldom commanded, but when he did Master Ted had to give in. His\ntemper was up, and Rob's masterful tone made it impossible to resist one\ncut at the rebellious dog before he submitted. Only a single blow, but\nit was a costly one; for as it fell, the dog sprang at Ted with a snarl,\nand Rob, rushing between the two, felt the sharp teeth pierce his leg.\nA word made Don let go and drop remorsefully at Rob's feet, for he loved\nhim and was evidently sorry to have hurt his friend by mistake. With a\nforgiving pat Rob left him, to limp to the barn followed by Ted, whose\nwrath was changed to shame and sorrow when he saw the red drops on Rob's\nsock and the little wounds in his leg.\n\n'I'm awfully sorry. Why did you get in the way? Here, wash it up, and\nI'll get a rag to tie on it,' he said quickly filling a sponge with\nwater and pulling out a very demoralized handkerchief. Rob usually made\nlight of his own mishaps and was over ready to forgive if others were to\nblame; but now he sat quite still, looking at the purple marks with such\na strange expression on his white face that Ted was troubled, though he\nadded with a laugh: 'Why, you're not afraid of a little dig like that,\nare you, Bobby?'\n\n'I am afraid of hydrophobia. But if Don is mad I'd rather be the one to\nhave it,' answered Rob, with a smile and a shiver.\n\nAt that dreadful word Ted turned whiter than his brother, and,\ndropping sponge and handkerchief, stared at him with a frightened face,\nwhispering in a tone of despair:\n\n'Oh, Rob, don't say it! What shall we do, what shall we do?'\n\n'Call Nan; she will know. Don't scare Aunty, or tell a soul but Nan;\nshe's on the back piazza; get her out here as quick as you can. I'll\nwash it till she comes. Maybe it's nothing; don't look so staggered,\nTed. I only thought it might be, as Don is queer.'\n\nRob tried to speak bravely; but Ted's long legs felt strangely weak as\nhe hurried away, and it was lucky he met no one, for his face would have\nbetrayed him. Nan was swinging luxuriously in a hammock, amusing herself\nwith a lively treatise on croup, when an agitated boy suddenly clutched\nher, whispering, as he nearly pulled her overboard:\n\n'Come to Rob in the barn! Don's mad and he's bitten him, and we don't\nknow what to do; it's all my fault; no one must know. Oh, do be quick!'\n\nNan was on her feet at once, startled, but with her wits about her, and\nboth were off without more words as they dodged round the house where\nunconscious Daisy chatted with her friends in the parlour and Aunt Meg\npeacefully took her afternoon nap upstairs.\n\nRob was braced up, and was as calm and steady as ever when they found\nhim in the harness-room, whither he had wisely retired, to escape\nobservation. The story was soon told, and after a look at Don, now in\nhis kennel, sad and surly, Nan said slowly, with her eye on the full\nwater-pan:\n\n'Rob, there is one thing to do for the sake of safety, and it must\nbe done at once. We can't wait to see if Don is--sick--or to go for a\ndoctor. I can do it, and I will; but it is very painful, and I hate to\nhurt you, dear.'\n\nA most unprofessional quiver got into Nan's voice as she spoke, and her\nkeen eyes dimmed as she looked at the two anxious young faces turned so\nconfidingly to her for help.\n\n'I know, burn it; well, do it, please; I can bear it. But Ted better\ngo away,' said Rob, with a firm setting of his lips, and a nod at his\nafflicted brother.\n\n'I won't stir; I can stand it if he can, only it ought to be me!' cried\nTed, with a desperate effort not to cry, so full of grief and fear and\nshame was he that it seemed as if he couldn't bear it like a man.\n\n'He'd better stay and help; do him good,' answered\n\nNan sternly, because, her heart was faint within her, knowing as she did\nall that might be in store for both poor boys. 'Keep quiet; I'll be back\nin a minute,' she added, going towards the house, while her quick mind\nhastily planned what was best to be done.\n\nIt was ironing day, and a hot fire still burned in the empty kitchen,\nfor the maids were upstairs resting. Nan put a slender poker to heat,\nand as she sat waiting for it, covered her face with her hands, asking\nhelp in this sudden need for strength, courage, and wisdom; for there\nwas no one else to call upon, and young as she was, she knew what was to\nbe done if she only had the nerve to do it. Any other patient would have\nbeen calmly interesting, but dear, good Robin, his father's pride, his\nmother's comfort, everyone's favourite and friend, that he should be\nin danger was very terrible; and a few hot tears dropped on the\nwell-scoured table as Nan tried to calm her trouble by remembering how\nvery likely it was to be all a mistake, a natural but vain alarm.\n\n'I must make light of it, or the boys will break down, and then there\nwill be a panic. Why afflict and frighten everyone when all is in doubt?\nI won't. I'll take Rob to Dr Morrison at once, and have the dog man see\nDon. Then, having done all we can, we will either laugh at our scare--if\nit is one--or be ready for whatever comes. Now for my poor boy.'\n\nArmed with the red-hot poker, a pitcher of ice-water, and several\nhandkerchiefs from the clotheshorse, Nan went back to the barn ready to\ndo her best in this her most serious 'emergency case'. The boys sat like\nstatues, one of despair, the other of resignation; and it took all Nan's\nboasted nerve to do her work quickly and well.\n\n'Now, Rob, only a minute, then we are safe. Stand by, Ted; he may be a\nbit faintish.'\n\nRob shut his eyes, clinched his hands, and sat like a hero. Ted knelt\nbeside him, white as a sheet, and as weak as a girl; for the pangs of\nremorse were rending him, and his heart failed at the thought of all\nthis pain because of his wilfulness. It was all over in a moment, with\nonly one little groan; but when Nan looked to her assistant to hand the\nwater, poor Ted needed it the most, for he had fainted away, and lay on\nthe floor in a pathetic heap of arms and legs.\n\nRob laughed, and, cheered by that unexpected sound, Nan bound up the\nwound with hands that never trembled, though great drops stood on her\nforehead; and she shared the water with patient number one before she\nturned to patient number two. Ted was much ashamed, and quite broken\nin spirit, when he found how he had failed at the critical moment, and\nbegged them not to tell, as he really could not help it; then by way of\nfinishing his utter humiliation, a burst of hysterical tears disgraced\nhis manly soul, and did him a world of good.\n\n'Never mind, never mind, we are all right now, and no one need be the\nwiser,' said Nan briskly, as poor Ted hiccoughed on Rob's shoulder,\nlaughing and crying in the most tempestuous manner, while his brother\nsoothed him, and the young doctor fanned both with Silas's old straw\nhat.\n\n'Now, boys, listen to me and remember what I say. We won't alarm anyone\nyet, for I've made up my mind our scare is all nonsense. Don was out\nlapping the water as I came by, and I don't believe he's mad any more\nthan I am. Still, to ease our minds and compose our spirits, and get our\nguilty faces out of sight for a while, I think we had better drive into\ntown to my old friend Dr Morrison, and let him just take a look at\nmy work, and give us some quieting little dose; for we are all rather\nshaken by this flurry. Sit still, Rob; and Ted, you harness up while I\nrun and get my hat and tell Aunty to excuse me to Daisy. I don't know\nthose Penniman girls, and she will be glad of our room at tea, and we'll\nhave a cosy bite at my house, and come home as gay as larks.'\n\nNan talked on as a vent for the hidden emotions which professional pride\nwould not allow her to show, and the boys approved her plan at once; for\naction is always easier than quiet waiting. Ted went staggering away to\nwash his face at the pump, and rub some colour into his cheeks before\nhe harnessed the horse. Rob lay tranquilly on the hay, looking up at the\nswallows again as he lived through some very memorable moments. Boy as\nhe was, the thought of death coming suddenly to him, and in this way,\nmight well make him sober; for it is a very solemn thing to be arrested\nin the midst of busy life by the possibility of the great change. There\nwere no sins to be repented of, few faults, and many happy, dutiful\nyears to remember with infinite comfort. So Rob had no fears to daunt\nhim, no regrets to sadden, and best of all, a very strong and simple\npiety to sustain and cheer him.\n\n'Mein Vater,' was his first thought; for Rob was very near the\nProfessor's heart, and the loss of his eldest would have been a bitter\nblow. These words, whispered with a tremble of the lips that had been so\nfirm when the hot iron burned, recalled that other Father who is always\nnear, always tender and helpful; and, folding his hands, Rob said the\nheartiest little prayer he ever prayed, there on the hay, to the soft\ntwitter of the brooding birds. It did him good; and wisely laying all\nhis fear and doubt and trouble in God's hand, the boy felt ready for\nwhatever was to come, and from that hour kept steadily before him the\none duty that was plain--to be brave and cheerful, keep silent, and hope\nfor the best.\n\nNan stole her hat, and left a note on Daisy's pincushion, saying she had\ntaken the boys to drive, and all would be out of the way till after tea.\nThen she hurried back and found her patients much better, the one for\nwork, the other for rest. In they got, and, putting Rob on the back seat\nwith his leg up drove away, looking as gay and care-free as if nothing\nhad happened.\n\nDr Morrison made light of the affair, but told Nan she had done right;\nand as the much-relieved lads went downstairs, he added in a whisper:\n'Send the dog off for a while, and keep your eye on the boy. Don't let\nhim know it, and report to me if anything seems wrong. One never knows\nin these cases. No harm to be careful.'\n\nNan nodded, and feeling much relieved now that the responsibility was\noff her shoulders, took the lads to Dr Watkins, who promised to come out\nlater and examine Don. A merry tea at Nan's house, which was kept open\nfor her all summer, did them good, and by the time they got home in the\ncool of the evening no sign of the panic remained but Ted's heavy eyes,\nand a slight limp when Rob walked. As the guests were still chattering\non the front piazza they retired to the back, and Ted soothed his\nremorseful soul by swinging Rob in the hammock, while Nan told stories\ntill the dog man arrived.\n\nHe said Don was a little under the weather, but no more mad than the\ngrey kitten that purred round his legs while the examination went on.\n\n'He wants his master, and feels the heat. Fed too well, perhaps. I'll\nkeep him a few weeks and send him home all right,' said Dr Watkins, as\nDon laid his great head in his hand, and kept his intelligent eyes on\nhis face, evidently feeling that this man understood his trials, and\nknew what to do for him.\n\nSo Don departed without a murmur, and our three conspirators took\ncounsel together how to spare the family all anxiety, and give Rob the\nrest his leg demanded. Fortunately, he always spent many hours in his\nlittle study, so he could lie on the sofa with a book in his hand\nas long as he liked, without exciting any remark. Being of a quiet\ntemperament, he did not worry himself or Nan with useless fears, but\nbelieved what was told him, and dismissing all dark possibilities, went\ncheerfully on his way, soon recovering from the shock of what he called\n'our scare'.\n\nBut excitable Ted was harder to manage, and it took all Nan's wit and\nwisdom to keep him from betraying the secret; for it was best to say\nnothing and spare all discussion of the subject for Rob's sake. Ted's\nremorse preyed upon him, and having no 'Mum' to confide in, he was very\nmiserable. By day he devoted himself to Rob, waiting on him, talking to\nhim, gazing anxiously at him, and worrying the good fellow very much;\nthough he wouldn't own it, since Ted found comfort in it. But at night,\nwhen all was quiet, Ted's lively imagination and heavy heart got the\nbetter of him, and kept him awake, or set him walking in his sleep. Nan\nhad her eye on him, and more than once administered a little dose to\ngive him a rest, read to him, scolded him, and when she caught him\nhaunting the house in the watches of the night, threatened to lock him\nup if he did not stay in his bed. This wore off after a while; but a\nchange came over the freakish boy, and everyone observed it, even before\nhis mother returned to ask what they had done to quench the Lion's\nspirits. He was gay, but not so heedless; and often when the old\nwilfulness beset him, he would check it sharply, look at Rob, and give\nup, or stalk away to have his sulk out alone. He no longer made fun of\nhis brother's old-fashioned ways and bookish tastes, but treated him\nwith a new and very marked respect, which touched and pleased modest\nRob, and much amazed all observers. It seemed as if he felt that he owed\nhim reparation for the foolish act that might have cost him his life;\nand love being stronger than will, Ted forgot his pride, and paid his\ndebt like an honest boy.\n\n'I don't understand it,' said Mrs Jo, after a week of home life, much\nimpressed by the good behaviour of her younger son. 'Ted is such a\nsaint, I'm afraid we are going to lose him. Is it Meg's sweet influence,\nor Daisy's fine cooking, or the pellets I catch Nan giving him on\nthe sly? Some witchcraft has been at work during my absence, and this\nwill-o'-the-wisp is so amiable, quiet, and obedient, I don't know him.'\n\n'He is growing up, heart's-dearest, and being a precocious plant, he\nbegins to bloom early. I also see a change in my Robchen. He is more\nmanly and serious than ever, and is seldom far from me, as if his\nlove for the old papa was growing with his growth. Our boys will often\nsurprise us in this way, Jo, and we can only rejoice over them and leave\nthem to become what Gott pleases.'\n\nAs the Professor spoke, his eyes rested proudly on the brothers, who\ncame walking up the steps together, Ted's arm over Rob's shoulder as\nhe listened attentively to some geological remarks Rob was making on a\nstone he held. Usually, Ted made fun of such tastes, and loved to lay\nboulders in the student's path, put brickbats under his pillow, gravel\nin his shoes, or send parcels of dirt by express to 'Prof. R. M. Bhaer'.\nLately, he had treated Rob's hobbies respectfully, and had begun to\nappreciate the good qualities of this quiet brother whom he had always\nloved but rather undervalued, till his courage under fire won Ted's\nadmiration, and made it impossible to forget a fault, the consequences\nof which might have been so terrible. The leg was still lame, though\ndoing well, and Ted was always offering an arm as support, gazing\nanxiously at his brother, and trying to guess his wants; for regret was\nstill keen in Ted's soul, and Rob's forgiveness only made it deeper. A\nfortunate slip on the stairs gave Rob an excuse for limping, and no one\nbut Nan and Ted saw the wound; so the secret was safe up to this time.\n\n'We are talking about you, my lads. Come in and tell us what good fairy\nhas been at work while we were gone. Or is it because absence sharpens\nour eyes, that we find such pleasant changes when we come back?' said\nMrs Jo, patting the sofa on either side, while the Professor forgot his\npiles of letters to admire the pleasing prospect of his wife in a bower\nof arms, as the boys sat down beside her, smiling affectionately, but\nfeeling a little guilty; for till now 'Mum' and 'Vater' knew every event\nin their boyish lives.\n\n'Oh, it's only because Bobby and I have been alone so much; we are sort\nof twins. I stir him up a bit, and he steadies me a great deal. You and\nfather do the same, you know. Nice plan. I like it'; and Ted felt that\nhe had settled the matter capitally.\n\n'Mother won't thank you for comparing yourself to her, Ted. I'm\nflattered at being like father in any way. I try to be,' answered Rob,\nas they laughed at Ted's compliment.\n\n'I do thank him, for it's true; and if you, Robin, do half as much for\nyour brother as Papa has for me, your life won't be a failure,' said\nMrs Jo heartily. 'I'm very glad to see you helping one another. It's the\nright way, and we can't begin too soon to try to understand the needs,\nvirtues, and failings of those nearest us. Love should not make us blind\nto faults, nor familiarity make us too ready to blame the shortcomings\nwe see. So work away, my sonnies, and give us more surprises of this\nsort as often as you like.'\n\n'The liebe Mutter has said all. I too am well pleased at the friendly\nbrother-warmth I find. It is good for everyone; long may it last!' and\nProfessor Bhaer nodded at the boys, who looked gratified, but rather at\na loss how to respond to these flattering remarks.\n\nRob wisely kept silent, fearing to say too much; but Ted burst out,\nfinding it impossible to help telling something:\n\n'The fact is I've been finding out what a brave good chap Bobby is, and\nI'm trying to make up for all the bother I've been to him. I knew he\nwas awfully wise, but I thought him rather soft, because he liked books\nbetter than larks, and was always fussing about his conscience. But I\nbegin to see that it isn't the fellows who talk the loudest and show\noff best that are the manliest. No, sir! quiet old Bob is a hero and a\ntrump, and I'm proud of him; so would you be if you knew all about it.'\n\nHere a look from Rob brought Ted up with a round turn; he stopped short,\ngrew red, and clapped his hand on his mouth in dismay.\n\n'Well, are we not to \"know all about it\"?' asked Mrs Jo quickly; for her\nsharp eye saw signs of danger and her maternal heart felt that something\nhad come between her and her sons. 'Boys,' she went on solemnly, 'I\nsuspect that the change we talk about is not altogether the effect of\ngrowing up, as we say. It strikes me that Ted has been in mischief and\nRob has got him out of some scrape; hence the lovely mood of my bad boy\nand the sober one of my conscientious son, who never hides anything from\nhis mother.'\n\nRob was as red as Ted now, but after a moment's hesitation he looked up\nand answered with an air of relief:\n\n'Yes, mother, that's it; but it's all over and no harm done, and I think\nwe'd better let it be, for a while at least. I did feel guilty to keep\nanything from you, but now you know so much I shall not worry and you\nneedn't either. Ted's sorry, I don't mind, and it has done us both\ngood.'\n\nMrs Jo looked at Ted, who winked hard but bore the look like a man;\nthen she turned to Rob, who smiled at her so cheerfully that she felt\nreassured; but something in his face struck her, and she saw what it was\nthat made him seem older, graver, yet more lovable than ever. It was the\nlook pain of mind, as well as body, brings, and the patience of a sweet\nsubmission to some inevitable trial. Like a flash she guessed that some\ndanger had been near her boy, and the glances she had caught between the\ntwo lads and Nan confirmed her fears.\n\n'Rob, dear, you have been ill, hurt, or seriously troubled by Ted? Tell\nme at once; I will not have any secrets now. Boys sometimes suffer all\ntheir lives from neglected accidents or carelessness. Fritz, make them\nspeak out!'\n\nMr Bhaer put down his papers and came to stand before them, saying in a\ntone that quieted Mrs Jo, and gave the boys courage:\n\n'My sons, give us the truth. We can bear it; do not hold it back to\nspare us. Ted knows we forgive much because we love him, so be frank,\nall two.'\n\nTed instantly dived among the sofa pillows and kept there, with only a\npair of scarlet ears visible, while Rob in a few words told the little\nstory, truthfully, but as gently as he could, hastening to add the\ncomfortable assurance that Don was not mad, the wound nearly well, and\nno danger would ever come of it.\n\nBut Mrs Jo grew so pale he had to put his arms about her, and his father\nturned and walked away, exclaiming: 'Ach Himmel!' in a tone of such\nmingled pain, relief, and gratitude, that Ted pulled an extra pillow\nover his head to smother the sound. They were all right in a minute;\nbut such news is always a shock, even if the peril is past, and Mrs Jo\nhugged her boy close till his father came and took him away, saying with\na strong shake of both hands and a quiver in his voice:\n\n'To be in danger of one's life tries a man's mettle, and you bear it\nwell; but I cannot spare my good boy yet; thank Gott, we keep him safe!'\n\nA smothered sound, between a choke and a groan, came from under the\npillows, and the writhing of Ted's long legs so plainly expressed\ndespair that his mother relented towards him, and burrowing till she\nfound a tousled yellow head, pulled it out and smoothed it, exclaiming\nwith an irrepressible laugh, though her cheeks were wet with tears:\n\n'Come and be forgiven, poor sinner! I know you have suffered enough, and\nI won't say a word; only if harm had come to Rob you would have made\nme more miserable than yourself. Oh, Teddy, Teddy, do try to cure that\nwilful spirit of yours before it is too late!'\n\n'Oh, Mum, I do try! I never can forget this--I hope it's cured me; if it\nhasn't, I am afraid I ain't worth saving,' answered Ted, pulling his own\nhair as the only way of expressing his deep remorse.\n\n'Yes, you are, my dear; I felt just so at fifteen when Amy was nearly\ndrowned, and Marmee helped me as I'll help you. Come to me, Teddy, when\nthe evil one gets hold of you, and together we'll rout him. Ah, me! I've\nhad many a tussle with that old Apollyon, and often got worsted, but not\nalways. Come under my shield, and we'll fight till we win.'\n\nNo one spoke for a minute as Ted and his mother laughed and cried in\none handkerchief, and Rob stood with his father's arm round him so happy\nthat all was told and forgiven, though never to be forgotten; for\nsuch experiences do one good, and knit hearts that love more closely\ntogether.\n\nPresently Ted rose straight up and going to his father, said bravely and\nhumbly:\n\n'I ought to be punished. Please do it; but first say you forgive me, as\nRob does.'\n\n'Always that, mein Sohn, seventy time seven, if needs be, else I am\nnot worthy the name you give me. The punishment has come; I can give no\ngreater. Let it not be in vain. It will not with the help of the mother\nand the All Father. Room here for both, always!'\n\nThe good Professor opened his arms and embraced his boys like a true\nGerman, not ashamed to express by gesture or by word the fatherly\nemotions an American would have compressed into a slap on the shoulder\nand a brief 'All right'.\n\nMrs Jo sat and enjoyed the prospect like a romantic soul as she was, and\nthen they had a quiet talk together, saying freely all that was in their\nhearts, and finding much comfort in the confidence which comes when love\ncasts out fear. It was agreed that nothing be said except to Nan,\nwho was to be thanked and rewarded for her courage, discretion, and\nfidelity.\n\n'I always knew that girl had the making of a fine woman in her, and this\nproves it. No panics and shrieks and faintings and fuss, but calm\nsense and energetic skill. Dear child, what can I give or do to show my\ngratitude?' said Mrs Jo enthusiastically.\n\n'Make Tom clear out and leave her in peace,' suggested Ted, almost\nhimself again, though a pensive haze still partially obscured his native\ngaiety.\n\n'Yes, do! he frets her like a mosquito. She forbade him to come out here\nwhile she stayed, and packed him off with Demi. I like old Tom, but he\nis a regular noodle about Nan,' added Rob, as he went away to help his\nfather with the accumulated letters.\n\n'I'll do it!' said Mrs Jo decidedly. 'That girl's career shall not be\nhampered by a foolish boy's fancy. In a moment of weariness she may give\nin, and then it's all over. Wiser women have done so and regretted it\nall their lives. Nan shall earn her place first, and prove that she can\nfill it; then she may marry if she likes, and can find a man worthy of\nher.'\n\nBut Mrs Jo's help was not needed; for love and gratitude can work\nmiracles, and when youth, beauty, accident, and photography are added,\nsuccess is sure; as was proved in the case of the unsuspecting but too\nsusceptible Thomas.\n\n\n\nChapter 8. JOSIE PLAYS MERMAID\n\nWhile the young Bhaers were having serious experiences at home, Josie\nwas enjoying herself immensely at Rocky Nook; for the Laurences knew how\nto make summer idleness both charming and wholesome. Bess was very fond\nof her little cousin; Mrs Amy felt that whether her niece was an actress\nor not she must be a gentlewoman, and gave her the social training\nwhich marks the well-bred woman everywhere; while Uncle Laurie was never\nhappier than when rowing, riding, playing, or lounging with two gay\ngirls beside him. Josie bloomed like a wild flower in this free life,\nBess grew rosy, brisk, and merry, and both were great favourites with\nthe neighbours, whose villas were by the shore or perched on the cliffs\nalong the pretty bay.\n\nOne crumpled rose-leaf disturbed Josie's peace, one baffled wish filled\nher with a longing which became a mania, and kept her as restless and\nwatchful as a detective with a case to 'work up'. Miss Cameron, the\ngreat actress, had hired one of the villas and retired thither to rest\nand 'create' a new part for next season. She saw no one but a friend\nor two, had a private beach, and was invisible except during her daily\ndrive, or when the opera-glasses of curious gazers were fixed on a\nblue figure disporting itself in the sea. The Laurences knew her, but\nrespected her privacy, and after a call left her in peace till she\nexpressed a wish for society--a courtesy which she remembered and repaid\nlater, as we shall see.\n\nBut Josie was like a thirsty fly buzzing about a sealed honey-pot, for\nthis nearness to her idol was both delightful and maddening. She pined\nto see, hear, talk with, and study this great and happy woman who could\nthrill thousands by her art, and win friends by her virtue, benevolence,\nand beauty. This was the sort of actress the girl meant to be, and few\ncould object if the gift was really hers; for the stage needs just such\nwomen to purify and elevate the profession which should teach as well as\namuse. If kindly Miss Cameron had known what passionate love and longing\nburned in the bosom of the little girl whom she idly observed skipping\nover the rocks, splashing about the beach, or galloping past her gate on\na Shetland pony, she would have made her happy by a look or a word. But\nbeing tired with her winter's work and busy with her new part, the lady\ntook no more notice of this young neighbour than of the sea-gulls in the\nbay or the daisies dancing in the fields. Nosegays left on her doorstep,\nserenades under her garden-wall, and the fixed stare of admiring eyes\nwere such familiar things that she scarcely minded them; and Josie grew\ndesperate when all her little attempts failed.\n\n'I might climb that pine-tree and tumble off on her piazza roof, or get\nSheltie to throw me just at her gate and be taken in fainting. It's no\nuse to try to drown myself when she is bathing. I can't sink, and she'd\nonly send a man to pull me out. What can I do? I will see her and tell\nher my hopes and make her say I can act some day. Mamma would believe\nher; and if--oh, if she only would let me study with her, what perfect\njoy that would be!'\n\nJosie made these remarks one afternoon as she and Bess prepared for a\nswim, a fishing party having prevented their morning bathe.\n\n'You must bide your time, dear, and not be so impatient. Papa promised\nto give you a chance before the season is over, and he always manages\nthings nicely. That will be better than any queer prank of yours,'\nanswered Bess, tying her pretty hair in a white net to match her suit,\nwhile Josie made a little lobster of herself in scarlet.\n\n'I hate to wait; but I suppose I must. Hope she will bathe this\nafternoon, though it is low tide. She told Uncle she should have to go\nin then because in the morning people stared so and went on her beach.\nCome and have a good dive from the big rock. No one round but nurses and\nbabies, so we can romp and splash as much as we like.'\n\nAway they went to have a fine time; for the little bay was free from\nother bathers, and the babies greatly admired their aquatic gymnastics,\nboth being expert swimmers.\n\nAs they sat dripping on the big rock Josie suddenly gave a clutch that\nnearly sent Bess overboard, as she cried excitedly:\n\n'There she is! Look! coming to bathe. How splendid! Oh, if she only\nwould drown a little and let me save her! or even get her toe nipped by\na crab; anything so I could go and speak!'\n\n'Don't seem to look; she comes to be quiet and enjoy herself. Pretend\nwe don't see her, that's only civil,' answered Bess, affecting to be\nabsorbed in a white-winged yacht going by.\n\n'Let's carelessly float that way as if going for seaweed on the rocks.\nShe can't mind if we are flat on our backs, with only our noses out.\nThen when we can't help seeing her, we'll swim back as if anxious to\nretire. That will impress her, and she may call to thank the very polite\nyoung ladies who respect her wishes,' proposed Josie, whose lively fancy\nwas always planning dramatic situations.\n\nJust as they were going to slip from their rock, as if Fate relented at\nlast, Miss Cameron was seen to beckon wildly as she stood waist-deep in\nthe water, looking down. She called to her maid, who seemed searching\nalong the beach for something, and not finding what she sought, waved a\ntowel towards the girls as if summoning them to help her.\n\n'Run, fly! she wants us, she wants us!' cried Josie, tumbling into the\nwater like a very energetic turtle, and swimming away in her best style\ntowards this long desired haven of joy. Bess followed more slowly, and\nboth came panting and smiling up to Miss Cameron, who never lifted her\neyes, but said in that wonderful voice of hers:\n\n'I've dropped a bracelet. I see it, but can't get it. Will the little\nboy find me a long stick? I'll keep my eye on it, so the water shall not\nwash it away.'\n\n'I'll dive for it with pleasure; but I'm not a boy,' answered Josie,\nlaughing as she shook the curly head which at a distance had deceived\nthe lady.\n\n'I beg your pardon. Dive away, child; the sand is covering it fast. I\nvalue it very much. Never forgot to take it off before.'\n\n'I'll get it!' and down went Josie, to come up with a handful of\npebbles, but no bracelet.\n\n'It's gone; never mind--my fault,' said Miss Cameron, disappointed, but\namused at the girl's dismay as she shook the water out of her eyes and\ngasped bravely:\n\n'No, it isn't. I'll have it, if I stay down all night!' and with one\nlong breath Josie dived again, leaving nothing but a pair of agitated\nfeet to be seen.\n\n'I'm afraid she will hurt herself,' said Miss Cameron, looking at Bess,\nwhom she recognized by her likeness to her mother.\n\n'Oh, no; Josie is a little fish. She likes it'; and Bess smiled happily\nat this wonderful granting of her cousin's desire.\n\n'You are Mr Laurence's daughter, I think? How d'ye do, dear? Tell papa\nI'm coming to see him soon. Too tired before. Quite savage. Better now.\nAh! here's our pearl of divers. What luck?' she asked, as the heels went\ndown and a dripping head came up.\n\nJosie could only choke and splutter at first, being half strangled;\nbut though her hands had failed again, her courage had not; and with a\nresolute shake of her wet hair, a bright look at the tall lady, and a\nseries of puffs to fill her lungs, she said calmly:\n\n'\"Never give up\" is my motto. I'm going to get it, if I go to Liverpool\nfor it! Now, then!' and down went the mermaid quite out of sight this\ntime, groping like a real lobster at the bottom of the sea.\n\n'Plucky little girl! I like that. Who is she?' asked the lady, sitting\ndown on a half-covered stone to watch her diver, since the bracelet was\nlost sight of.\n\nBess told her, adding, with the persuasive smile of her father: 'Josie\nlongs to be an actress, and has waited for a month to see you. This is a\ngreat happiness for her.'\n\n'Bless the child! why didn't she come and call? I'd have let her in;\nthough usually I avoid stage-struck girls as I do reporters,' laughed\nMiss Cameron.\n\nThere was no time for more; a brown hand, grasping the bracelet, rose\nout of the sea, followed by a purple face as Josie came up so blind and\ndizzy she could only cling to Bess, half drowned but triumphant.\n\nMiss Cameron drew her to the rock where she sat, and pushing the hair\nout of her eyes, revived her with a hearty 'Bravo! bravo!' which assured\nthe girl that her first act was a hit. Josie had often imagined her\nmeeting with the great actress--the dignity and grace with which she\nwould enter and tell her ambitious hopes, the effective dress she would\nwear, the witty things she would say, the deep impression her budding\ngenius would make. But never in her wildest moments had she imagined\nan interview like this; scarlet, sandy, streaming, and speechless she\nleaned against the illustrious shoulder, looking like a beautiful seal\nas she blinked and wheezed till she could smile joyfully and exclaim\nproudly:\n\n'I did get it! I'm so glad!'\n\n'Now get your breath, my dear; then I shall be glad also. It was very\nnice of you to take all that trouble for me. How shall I thank you?'\nasked the lady, looking at her with the beautiful eyes that could say so\nmany things without words.\n\nJosie clasped her hands with a wet spat which rather destroyed the\neffect of the gesture, and answered in a beseeching tone that would have\nsoftened a far harder heart than Miss Cameron's:\n\n'Let me come and see you once--only once! I want you to tell me if I\ncan act; you will know. I'll abide by what you say; and if you think\nI can--by and by, when I've studied very hard--I shall be the happiest\ngirl in the world. May I?'\n\n'Yes; come tomorrow at eleven. We'll have a good talk; you shall show me\nwhat you can do, and I'll give you my opinion. But you won't like it.'\n\n'I will, no matter if you tell me I'm a fool. I want it settled; so\ndoes mamma. I'll take it bravely if you say no; and if you say yes, I'll\nnever give up till I've done my best--as you did.'\n\n'Ah, my child, it's a weary road, and there are plenty of thorns among\nthe roses when you've won them. I think you have the courage, and this\nproves that you have perseverance. Perhaps you'll do. Come, and we'll\nsee.'\n\nMiss Cameron touched the bracelet as she spoke, and smiled so kindly\nthat impetuous Josie wanted to kiss her; but wisely refrained, though\nher eyes were wet with softer water than any in the sea as she thanked\nher.\n\n'We are keeping Miss Cameron from her bath, and the tide is going out.\nCome, Josie,' said thoughtful Bess, fearing to outstay their welcome.\n\n'Run over the beach and get warm. Thank you very much, little mermaid.\nTell papa to bring his daughter to see me any time. Good-bye'; and with\na wave of her hand the tragedy queen dismissed her court, but remained\non her weedy throne watching the two lithe figures race over the sand\nwith twinkling feet till they were out of sight. Then, as she calmly\nbobbed up and down in the water, she said to herself: 'The child has a\ngood stage face, vivid, mobile; fine eyes, abandon, pluck, will. Perhaps\nshe'll do. Good stock--talent in the family. We shall see.'\n\nOf course Josie never slept a wink, and was in a fever of joyful\nexcitement next day. Uncle Laurie enjoyed the episode very much,\nand Aunt Amy looked out her most becoming white dress for the grand\noccasion; Bess lent her most artistic hat, and Josie ranged the wood\nand marsh for a bouquet of wild roses, sweet white azalea, ferns, and\ngraceful grasses, as the offering of a very grateful heart.\n\nAt ten she solemnly arrayed herself, and then sat looking at her neat\ngloves and buckled shoes till it was time to go, growing pale and sober\nwith the thought that her fate was soon to be decided; for, like all\nyoung people she was sure that her whole life could be settled by one\nhuman creature, quite forgetting how wonderfully Providence trains us\nby disappointment, surprises us with unexpected success, and turns our\nseeming trials into blessings.\n\n'I will go alone: we shall be freer so. Oh, Bess, pray that she may tell\nme rightly! So much depends on that! Don't laugh, uncle! It is a very\nserious moment for me. Miss Cameron knows that, and will tell you so.\nKiss me, Aunt Amy, since mamma isn't here. If you say I look nice, I'm\nquite satisfied. Good-bye.' And with a wave of the hand as much like her\nmodel's as she could make it, Josie departed, looking very pretty and\nfeeling very tragical.\n\nSure now of admittance, she boldly rang at the door which excluded so\nmany, and being ushered into a shady parlour, feasted her eyes upon\nseveral fine portraits of great actors while she waited. She had read\nabout most of them, and knew their trials and triumphs so well that she\nsoon forgot herself, and tried to imitate Mrs Siddons as Lady Macbeth,\nlooking up at the engraving as she held her nosegay like the candle in\nthe sleep-walking scene, and knit her youthful brows distressfully while\nmurmuring the speech of the haunted queen. So busy was she that Miss\nCameron watched her for several minutes unseen, then startled her by\nsuddenly sweeping in with the words upon her lips, the look upon her\nface, which made that one of her greatest scenes.\n\n'I never can do it like that; but I'll keep trying, if you say I may,'\ncried Josie, forgetting her manners in the intense interest of the\nmoment.\n\n'Show me what you can do,' answered the actress, wisely plunging into\nthe middle of things at once, well knowing that no common chat would\nsatisfy this very earnest little person.\n\n'First let me give you these. I thought you'd like wild things better\nthan hot-house flowers; and I loved to bring them, as I'd no other way\nto thank you for your great kindness to me,' said Josie, offering her\nnosegay with a simple warmth that was very sweet.\n\n'I do love them best, and keep my room full of the posies some good\nfairy hangs on my gate. Upon my word, I think I've found the fairy\nout--these are so like,' she added quickly, as her eye went from the\nflowers in her hand to others that stood near by, arranged with the same\ntaste.\n\nJosie's blush and smile betrayed her before she said, with a look full\nof girlish adoration and humility: 'I couldn't help it; I admire you so\nmuch. I know it was a liberty; but as I couldn't get in myself, I loved\nto think my posies pleased you.'\n\nSomething about the child and her little offering touched the woman,\nand, drawing Josie to her, she said, with no trace of actress in face or\nvoice:\n\n'They did please me, dear, and so do you. I'm tired of praise; and love\nis very sweet, when it is simple and sincere like this.'\n\nJosie remembered to have heard, among many other stories, that Miss\nCameron lost her lover years ago, and since had lived only for art.\nNow she felt that this might have been true; and pity for the splendid,\nlonely life made her face very eloquent, as well as grateful. Then, as\nif anxious to forget the past, her new friend said, in the commanding\nway that seemed natural to her:\n\n'Let me see what you can do. Juliet, of course. All begin with that.\nPoor soul, how she is murdered!'\n\nNow, Josie had intended to begin with Romeo's much-enduring sweetheart,\nand follow her up with Bianca, Pauline, and several of the favourite\nidols of stage-struck girls; but being a shrewd little person, she\nsuddenly saw the wisdom of Uncle Laurie's advice, and resolved to\nfollow it. So instead of the rant Miss Cameron expected, Josie gave poor\nOphelia's mad scene, and gave it very well, having been trained by\nthe college professor of elocution and done it many times. She was too\nyoung, of course, but the white gown, the loose hair, the real flowers\nshe scattered over the imaginary grave, added to the illusion; and she\nsung the songs sweetly, dropped her pathetic curtsies, and vanished\nbehind the curtain that divided the rooms with a backward look that\nsurprised her critical auditor into a quick gesture of applause. Cheered\nby that welcome sound, Josie ran back as a little hoyden in one of the\nfarces she had often acted, telling a story full of fun and naughtiness\nat first, but ending with a sob of repentance and an earnest prayer for\npardon.\n\n'Very good! Try again. Better than I expected,' called the voice of the\noracle.\n\nJosie tried Portia's speech, and recited very well, giving due emphasis\nto each fine sentence. Then, unable to refrain from what she considered\nher greatest effort, she burst into Juliet's balcony scene, ending with\nthe poison and the tomb. She felt sure that she surpassed herself, and\nwaited for applause. A ringing laugh made her tingle with indignation\nand disappointment, as she went to stand before Miss Cameron, saying in\na tone of polite surprise:\n\n'I have been told that I did it very well. I'm sorry you don't think\nso.'\n\n'My dear, it's very bad. How can it help being so? What can a child like\nyou know of love and fear and death? Don't try it yet. Leave tragedy\nalone till you are ready for it.'\n\n'But you clapped Ophelia.'\n\n'Yes, that was very pretty. Any clever girl can do it effectively. But\nthe real meaning of Shakespeare is far above you yet, child. The comedy\nbit was best. There you showed real talent. It was both comic and\npathetic. That's art. Don't lose it. The Portia was good declamation.\nGo on with that sort of thing; it trains the voice--teaches shades of\nexpression. You've a good voice and natural grace--great helps both,\nhard to acquire.'\n\n'Well, I'm glad I've got something,' sighed Josie, sitting meekly on a\nstool, much crestfallen, but not daunted yet, and bound to have her say\nout.\n\n'My dear little girl, I told you that you would not like what I should\nsay to you; yet I must be honest if I would really help you. I've had to\ndo it for many like you; and most of them have never forgiven me, though\nmy words have proved true, and they are what I advised them to be--good\nwives and happy mothers in quiet homes. A few have kept on, and done\nfairly well. One you will hear of soon, I think; for she has talent,\nindomitable patience, and mind as well as beauty. You are too young\nto show to which class you belong. Geniuses are very rare, and even at\nfifteen seldom give much promise of future power.'\n\n'Oh, I don't think I'm a genius!' cried Josie, growing calm and sober as\nshe listened to the melodious voice and looked into the expressive face\nthat filled her with confidence, so strong, sincere, and kindly was it.\n'I only want to find out if I have talent enough to go on, and after\nyears of study to be able to act well in any of the good plays people\nnever tire of seeing. I don't expect to be a Mrs Siddons or a Miss\nCameron, much as I long to be; but it does seem as if I had something\nin me which can't come out in any way but this. When I act I'm perfectly\nhappy. I seem to live, to be in my own world, and each new part is a new\nfriend. I love Shakespeare, and am never tired of his splendid people.\nOf course, I don't understand it all; but it's like being alone at night\nwith the mountains and the stars, solemn and grand, and I try to imagine\nhow it will look when the sun comes up, and all is glorious and clear to\nme. I can't see, but I feel the beauty, and long to express it.'\n\nAs she spoke with the most perfect self-forgetfulness Josie was pale\nwith excitement, her eyes shone, her lips trembled, and all her little\nsoul seemed trying to put into words the emotions that filled it to\noverflowing. Miss Cameron understood, felt that this was something\nmore than a girlish whim; and when she answered there was a new tone\nof sympathy in her voice, a new interest in her face, though she wisely\nrefrained from saying all she thought, well knowing what splendid dreams\nyoung people build upon a word, and how bitter is the pain when the\nbright bubbles burst.\n\n'If you feel this, I can give you no better advice than to go on loving\nand studying our great master,' she said slowly; but Josie caught the\nchanged tone, and felt, with a thrill of joy, that her new friend was\nspeaking to her now as to a comrade. 'It is an education in itself, and\na lifetime is not long enough to teach you all his secret. But there is\nmuch to do before you can hope to echo his words. Have you the patience,\ncourage, strength, to begin at the beginning, and slowly, painfully, lay\nthe foundation for future work? Fame is a pearl many dive for and only\na few bring up. Even when they do, it is not perfect, and they sigh for\nmore, and lose better things in struggling for them.'\n\nThe last words seemed spoken more to herself than to her hearer, but\nJosie answered quickly, with a smile and an expressive gesture:\n\n'I got the bracelet in spite of all the bitter water in my eyes.'\n\n'You did! I don't forget it. A good omen. We will accept it.'\n\nMiss Cameron answered the smile with one that was like sunshine to the\ngirl, and stretched her white hands as if taking some invisible gift.\nThen added in a different tone, watching the effect of her words on the\nexpressive face before her:\n\n'Now you will be disappointed, for instead of telling you to come and\nstudy with me, or go and act in some second-rate theatre at once, I\nadvise you to go back to school and finish your education. That is the\nfirst step, for all accomplishments are needed, and a single talent\nmakes a very imperfect character. Cultivate mind and body, heart and\nsoul, and make yourself an intelligent, graceful, beautiful, and healthy\ngirl. Then, at eighteen or twenty, go into training and try your powers.\nBetter start for the battle with your arms in order, and save the hard\nlesson which comes when we rush on too soon. Now and then genius carries\nall before it, but not often. We have to climb slowly, with many slips\nand falls. Can you wait as well as work?'\n\n'I will!'\n\n'We shall see. It would be pleasant to me to know that when I quit the\nstage I leave behind me a well-trained, faithful, gifted comrade to\nmore than fill my place, and carry on what I have much at heart--the\npurification of the stage. Perhaps you are she; but remember, mere\nbeauty and rich costumes do not make an actress, nor are the efforts of\na clever little girl to play great characters real art. It is all dazzle\nand sham, and a disgrace and disappointment now. Why will the public be\nsatisfied with opera bouffe, or the trash called society plays when\na world of truth and beauty, poetry and pathos lies waiting to be\ninterpreted and enjoyed?'\n\nMiss Cameron had forgotten to whom she spoke, and walked to and fro,\nfull of the noble regret all cultivated people feel at the low state of\nthe stage nowadays.\n\n'That's what Uncle Laurie says; and he and Aunt Jo try to plan plays\nabout true and lovely things--simple domestic scenes that touch people's\nhearts, and make them laugh and cry and feel better. Uncle says that\nsort is my style, and I must not think of tragedy. But it's so much\nnicer to sweep about in crowns and velvet trains than to wear everyday\nclothes, and just be myself, though it is so easy.'\n\n'Yet that is high art, child, and what we need for a time till we are\nready for the masters. Cultivate that talent of yours. It is a special\ngift, this power to bring tears and smiles, and a sweeter task to touch\nthe heart than to freeze the blood or fire the imagination. Tell your\nuncle he is right, and ask your aunt to try a play for you. I'll come\nand see it when you are ready.'\n\n'Will you? Oh! will you? We are going to have some at Christmas, with a\nnice part for me. A simple little thing, but I can do it, and should be\nso proud, so happy to have you there.'\n\nJosie rose as she spoke, for a glance at the clock showed her that her\ncall was a long one; and hard as it was to end this momentous interview,\nshe felt that she must go. Catching up her hat she went to Miss Cameron,\nwho stood looking at her so keenly that she felt as transparent as a\npane of glass, and coloured prettily as she looked up, saying, with a\ngrateful little tremor in her voice:\n\n'I can never thank you for this hour and all you have told me. I shall\ndo just what you advise, and mamma will be very glad to see me settled\nat my books again. I can study now with all my heart, because it is to\nhelp me on; and I won't hope too much, but work and wait, and try to\nplease you, as the only way to pay my debt.'\n\n'That reminds me that I have not paid mine. Little friend, wear this\nfor my sake. It is fit for a mermaid, and will remind you of your first\ndive. May the next bring up a better jewel, and leave no bitter water on\nyour lips!'\n\nAs she spoke, Miss Cameron took from the lace at her throat a pretty\npin of aquamarine, and fastened it like an order on Josie's proud bosom;\nthen lifting the happy little face, she kissed it very tenderly, and\nwatched it go smiling away with eyes that seemed to see into a future\nfull of the trials and the triumphs which she knew so well.\n\nBess expected to see Josie come flying in, all raptures and excitement,\nor drowned in tears of disappointment, but was surprised at the\nexpression of calm content and resolution which she wore. Pride and\nsatisfaction, and a new feeling of responsibility both sobered and\nsustained her, and she felt that any amount of dry study and long\nwaiting would be bearable, if in the glorious future she could be\nan honour to her profession and a comrade to the new friend whom she\nalready adored with girlish ardour.\n\nShe told her little story to a deeply interested audience, and all\nfelt that Miss Cameron's advice was good. Mrs Amy was relieved at the\nprospect of delay; for she did not want her niece to be an actress and\nhoped the fancy would die out.\n\nUncle Laurie was full of charming plans and prophecies and wrote one\nof his most delightful notes to thank their neighbour for her kindness;\nwhile Bess, who loved art of all kinds, fully sympathized with her\ncousin's ambitious hopes, only wondering why she preferred to act out\nher visions rather than embody them in marble.\n\nThat first interview was not the last; for Miss Cameron was really\ninterested, and had several memorable conversations with the Laurences,\nwhile the girls sat by, drinking in every word with the delight all\nartists feel in their own beautiful world, and learning to see how\nsacred good gifts are, how powerful, and how faithfully they should be\nused for high ends, each in its own place helping to educate, refine,\nand refresh.\n\nJosie wrote reams to her mother; and when the visit ended rejoiced her\nheart by bringing her a somewhat changed little daughter, who fell to\nwork at the once-detested books with a patient energy which surprised\nand pleased everyone. The right string had been touched, and even French\nexercises and piano practice became endurable, since accomplishments\nwould be useful by and by; dress, manners, and habits were all\ninteresting now, because 'mind and body, heart and soul, must be\ncultivated', and while training to become an 'intelligent, graceful,\nhealthy girl', little Josie was unconsciously fitting herself to play\nher part well on whatever stage the great Manager might prepare for her.\n\n\n\nChapter 9. THE WORM TURNS\n\nTwo very superior bicycles went twinkling up the road to Plumfield\none September afternoon, bearing two brown and dusty riders evidently\nreturning from a successful run, for though their legs might be a trifle\nweary, their faces beamed as they surveyed the world from their lofty\nperches with the air of calm content all wheelmen wear after they have\nlearned to ride; before that happy period anguish of mind and body is\nthe chief expression of the manly countenance.\n\n'Go ahead and report, Tom; I'm due here. See you later,' said Demi,\nswinging himself down at the door of the Dovecote.\n\n'Don't peach, there's a good fellow. Let me have it out with Mother\nBhaer first,' returned Tom, wheeling in at the gate with a heavy sigh.\n\nDemi laughed, and his comrade went slowly up the avenue, devoutly hoping\nthat the coast was clear; for he was the bearer of tidings which would,\nhe thought, convulse the entire family with astonishment and dismay.\n\nTo his great joy Mrs Jo was discovered alone in a grove of proof-sheets,\nwhich she dropped, to greet the returning wanderer cordially. But after\nthe first glance she saw that something was the matter, recent events\nhaving made her unusually sharp-eyed and suspicious.\n\n'What is it now, Tom?' she asked, as he subsided into an easy-chair with\na curious expression of mingled fear, shame, amusement, and distress in\nhis brick-red countenance.\n\n'I'm in an awful scrape, ma'am.'\n\n'Of course; I'm always prepared for scrapes when you appear. What is\nit? Run over some old lady who is going to law about it?' asked Mrs Jo\ncheerfully.\n\n'Worse than that,' groaned Tom.\n\n'Not poisoned some trusting soul who asked you to prescribe, I hope?'\n\n'Worse than that.'\n\n'You haven't let Demi catch any horrid thing and left him behind, have\nyou?'\n\n'Worse even than that.'\n\n'I give it up. Tell me quick; I hate to wait for bad news.'\n\nHaving got his listener sufficiently excited, Tom launched his\nthunderbolt in one brief sentence, and fell back to watch the effect.\n\n'I'm engaged!'\n\nMrs Jo's proof-sheets flew wildly about as she clasped her hands,\nexclaiming in dismay:\n\n'If Nan has yielded, I'll never forgive her!'\n\n'She hasn't; it's another girl.'\n\nTom's face was so funny as he said the words, that it was impossible\nto help laughing; for he looked both sheepish and pleased, besides very\nmuch perplexed and worried.\n\n'I'm glad, very glad indeed! Don't care who it is; and I hope you'll\nbe married soon. Now tell me all about it,' commanded Mrs Jo, so much\nrelieved that she felt ready for anything.\n\n'What will Nan say?' demanded Tom, rather taken aback at this view of\nhis predicament.\n\n'She will be rejoiced to get rid of the mosquito who has plagued her so\nlong. Don't worry about Nan. Who is this \"other girl\"?'\n\n'Demi hasn't written about her?'\n\n'Only something about your upsetting a Miss West down at Quitno; I\nthought that was scrape enough.'\n\n'That was only the beginning of a series of scrapes. Just my luck! Of\ncourse after sousing the poor girl I had to be attentive to her, hadn't\nI? Everyone seemed to think so, and I couldn't get away, and so I was\nlost before I knew it. It's all Demi's fault, he would stay there and\nfuss with his old photos, because the views were good and all the girls\nwanted to be taken. Look at these, will you, ma'am? That's the way we\nspent our time when we weren't playing tennis'; and Tom pulled a\nhandful of pictures from his pocket, displaying several in which he was\nconspicuous, either holding a sun-umbrella over a very pretty young lady\non the rocks, reposing at her feet in the grass, or perched on a piazza\nrailing with other couples in seaside costumes and effective attitudes.\n\n'This is she of course?' asked Mrs Jo, pointing to the much-ruffled\ndamsel with the jaunty hat, coquettish shoes, and racquet in her hand.\n\n'That's Dora. Isn't she lovely?' cried Tom, forgetting his tribulations\nfor a moment and speaking with lover-like ardour.\n\n'Very nice little person to look at. Hope she is not a Dickens Dora?\nThat curly crop looks like it.'\n\n'Not a bit; she's very smart; can keep house, and sew, and do lots\nof things, I assure you, ma'am. All the girls like her, and she's\nsweet-tempered and jolly, and sings like a bird, and dances beautifully,\nand loves books. Thinks yours are splendid, and made me talk about you\nno end.'\n\n'That last sentence is to flatter me and win my help to get you out of\nthe scrape. Tell me first how you got in'; and Mrs Jo settled herself to\nlisten with interest, never tired of boys' affairs.\n\nTom gave his head a rousing rub all over to clear his wits, and plunged\ninto his story with a will.\n\n'Well, we've met her before, but I didn't know she was there. Demi\nwanted to see a fellow, so we went, and finding it nice and cool rested\nover Sunday. Found some pleasant people and went out rowing; I had Dora,\nand came to grief on a confounded rock. She could swim, no harm done,\nonly the scare and the spoilt gown. She took it well, and we got\nfriendly at once--couldn't help it, scrambling into that beast of a boat\nwhile the rest laughed at us. Of course we had to stay another day to\nsee that Dora was all right. Demi wanted to. Alice Heath is down there\nand two other girls from our college, so we sort of lingered along,\nand Demi kept taking pictures, and we danced, and got into a tennis\ntournament; and that was as good exercise as wheeling, we thought. Fact\nis, tennis is a dangerous game, ma'am. A great deal of courting goes\non in those courts, and we fellows find that sort of \"serving\" mighty\nagreeable, don't you know?'\n\n'Not much tennis in my day, but I understand perfectly,' said Mrs Jo,\nenjoying it all as much as Tom did.\n\n'Upon my word, I hadn't the least idea of being serious,' he continued\nslowly, as if this part of his tale was hard to tell; 'but everyone else\nspooned, so I did. Dora seemed to like it and expect it, and of course\nI was glad to be agreeable. She thought I amounted to something, though\nNan does not, and it was pleasant to be appreciated after years of\nsnubbing. Yes, it was right down jolly to have a sweet girl smile at you\nall day, and blush prettily when you said a neat thing to her, and look\nglad when you came, sorry when you left, and admire all you did, and\nmake you feel like a man and act your best. That's the sort of treatment\na fellow enjoys and ought to get if he behaves himself; not frowns and\ncold shoulders year in and year out, and made to look like a fool when\nhe means well, and is faithful, and has loved a girl ever since he was a\nboy. No, by Jove, it's not fair, and I won't stand it!'\n\nTom waxed warm and eloquent as he thought over his wrongs, and bounced\nup to march about the room, wagging his head and trying to feel\naggrieved as usual, but surprised to find that his heart did not ache a\nbit.\n\n'I wouldn't. Drop the old fancy, for it was nothing more, and take up\nthe new one, if it is genuine. But how came you to propose, Tom, as you\nmust have done to be engaged?' asked Mrs Jo, impatient for the crisis of\nthe tale.\n\n'Oh, that was an accident. I didn't mean it at all; the donkey did it,\nand I couldn't get out of the scrape without hurting Dora's feelings,\nyou see,' began Tom, seeing that the fatal moment had come.\n\n'So there were two donkeys in it, were there?' said Mrs Jo, foreseeing\nfun of some sort.\n\n'Don't laugh! It sounds funny, I know; but it might have been awful,'\nanswered Tom darkly, though a twinkle of the eye showed that his love\ntrials did not quite blind him to the comic side of the adventure.\n\n'The girls admired our new wheels, and of course we liked to show off.\nTook 'em to ride, and had larks generally. Well, one day, Dora was\non behind, and we were going nicely along a good bit of road, when a\nridiculous old donkey got right across the way. I thought he'd move, but\nhe didn't, so I gave him a kick; he kicked back, and over we went in a\nheap, donkey and all. Such a mess! I thought only of Dora, and she had\nhysterics; at least, she laughed till she cried, and that beast brayed,\nand I lost my head. Any fellow would, with a poor girl gasping in the\nroad, and he wiping her tears and begging pardon, not knowing whether\nher bones were broken or not. I called her my darling, and went on like\na fool in my flurry, till she grew calmer, and said, with such a look:\n\"I forgive you, Tom. Pick me up, and let us go on again.\"\n\n'Wasn't that sweet now, after I'd upset her for the second time? It\ntouched me to the heart; and I said I'd like to go on for ever with such\nan angel to steer for, and--well I don't know what I did say; but you\nmight have knocked me down with a feather when she put her arm round my\nneck and whispered: \"Tom, dear, with you I'm not afraid of any lions in\nthe path.\" She might have said donkeys; but she was in earnest, and she\nspared my feelings. Very nice of the dear girl; but there I am with two\nsweethearts on my hands, and in a deuce of a scrape.'\n\nFinding it impossible to contain herself another moment, Mrs Jo laughed\ntill the tears ran down her cheeks at this characteristic episode; and\nafter one reproachful look, which only added to her merriment, Tom burst\ninto a jolly roar that made the room ring.\n\n'Tommy Bangs! Tommy Bangs! who but you could ever get into such a\ncatastrophe?' said Mrs Jo, when she recovered her breath.\n\n'Isn't it a muddle all round, and won't everyone chaff me to death about\nit? I shall have to quit old Plum for a while,' answered Tom, as he\nmopped his face, trying to realize the full danger of his position.\n\n'No, indeed; I'll stand by you, for I think it the best joke of the\nseason. But tell me how things ended. Is it really serious, or only a\nsummer flirtation? I don't approve of them, but boys and girls will play\nwith edged tools and cut their fingers.'\n\n'Well, Dora considers herself engaged, and wrote to her people at once.\nI couldn't say a word when she took it all in solemn earnest and seemed\nso happy. She's only seventeen, never liked anyone before, and is sure\nall will be all right; as her father knows mine, and we are both well\noff. I was so staggered that I said:\n\n'\"Why, you can't love me really when we know so little of one another?\"\nBut she answered right out of her tender little heart: \"Yes, I do,\ndearly, Tom; you are so gay and kind and honest, I couldn't help it.\"\nNow, after that what could I do but go ahead and make her happy while I\nstayed, and trust to luck to straighten the snarl out afterwards?'\n\n'A truly Tomian way of taking things easy. I hope you told your father\nat once.'\n\n'Oh yes, I wrote off and broke it to him in three lines. I said: \"Dear\nFather, I'm engaged to Dora West, and I hope she will suit the family.\nShe suits me tip-top. Yours ever, Tom.\" He was all right, never liked\nNan, you know; but Dora will suit him down to the ground.' And Tom\nlooked entirely satisfied with his own tact and taste.\n\n'What did Demi say to this rapid and funny lovemaking? Wasn't he\nscandalized?' asked Mrs Jo, trying not to laugh again as she thought of\nthe unromantic spectacle of donkey, bicycle, boy, and girl all in the\ndust together.\n\n'Not a bit. He was immensely interested and very kind; talked to me like\na father; said it was a good thing to steady a fellow, only I must be\nhonest with her and myself and not trifle a moment. Demi is a regular\nSolomon, especially when he is in the same boat,' answered Tom, looking\nwise.\n\n'You don't mean--?' gasped Mrs Jo, in sudden alarm at the bare idea of\nmore love-affairs just yet.\n\n'Yes, I do, please, ma'am; it's a regular sell all the way through, and\nI owe Demi one for taking me into temptation blindfold. He said he went\nto Quitno to see Fred Wallace, but he never saw the fellow. How could\nhe, when Wallace was off in his yacht all the time we were there? Alice\nwas the real attraction, and I was left to my fate, while they were\nmaundering round with that old camera. There were three donkeys in\nthis affair, and I'm not the worst one, though I shall have to bear the\nlaugh. Demi will look innocent and sober, and no one will say a word to\nhim.'\n\n'The midsummer madness has broken out, and no one knows who will be\nstricken next. Well, leave Demi to his mother, and let us see what you\nare going to do, Tom.'\n\n'I don't know exactly; it's awkward to be in love with two girls at\nonce. What do you advise?'\n\n'A common-sense view of the case, by all means. Dora loves you and\nthinks you love her. Nan does not care for you, and you only care for\nher as a friend, though you have tried to do more. It is my opinion,\nTom, that you love Dora, or are on the way to it; for in all these\nyears I've never seen you look or speak about Nan as you do about Dora.\nOpposition has made you obstinately cling to her till accident has shown\nyou a more attractive girl. Now, I think you had better take the old\nlove for a friend, the new one for a sweetheart, and in due time, if the\nsentiment is genuine, marry her.'\n\nIf Mrs Jo had any doubts about the matter, Tom's face would have proved\nthe truth of her opinion; for his eyes shone, his lips smiled, and in\nspite of dust and sunburn a new expression of happiness quite glorified\nhim as he stood silent for a moment, trying to understand the beautiful\nmiracle which real love works when it comes to a young man's heart.\n\n'The fact is I meant to make Nan jealous, for she knows Dora, and I was\nsure would hear of our doings. I was tired of being walked on, and I\nthought I'd try to break away and not be a bore and a laughing-stock any\nmore,' he said slowly, as if it relieved him to pour out his doubts and\nwoes and hopes and joys to his old friend. 'I was regularly astonished\nto find it so easy and so pleasant. I didn't mean to do any harm,\nbut drifted along beautifully, and told Demi to mention things in his\nletters to Daisy, so Nan might know. Then I forgot Nan altogether, and\nsaw, heard, felt, cared for no one but Dora, till the donkey--bless his\nold heart!--pitched her into my arms and I found she loved me. Upon my\nsoul, I don't see why she should! I'm not half good enough.'\n\n'Every honest man feels that when an innocent girl puts her hand in his.\nMake yourself worthy of her, for she isn't an angel, but a woman with\nfaults of her own for you to bear, and forgive, and you must help one\nanother,' said Mrs Jo, trying to realize that this sober youth was her\nscapegrace Tommy.\n\n'What troubles me is that I didn't mean it when I began, and was going\nto use the dear girl as an instrument of torture for Nan. It wasn't\nright, and I don't deserve to be so happy. If all my scrapes ended as\nwell as this, what a state of bliss I should be in!' and Tom beamed\nagain at the rapturous prospect.\n\n'My dear boy, it is not a scrape, but a very sweet experience suddenly\ndawning upon you,' answered Mrs Jo, speaking very soberly; for she saw\nhe was in earnest. 'Enjoy it wisely and be worthy of it, for it is a\nserious thing to accept a girl's love and trust, and let her look up to\nyou for tenderness and truth in return. Don't let little Dora look in\nvain, but be a man in all things for her sake, and make this affection a\nblessing to you both.'\n\n'I'll try. Yes, I do love her, only I can't believe it just yet. Wish\nyou knew her. Dear little soul, I long to see her already! She cried\nwhen we parted last night and I hated to go.' Tom's hand went to his\ncheek as if he still felt the rosy little seal Dora had set upon his\npromise not to forget her, and for the first time in his happy-go-lucky\nlife Tommy Bangs understood the difference between sentiment and\nsentimentality. The feeling recalled Nan, for he had never known that\ntender thrill when thinking of her, and the old friendship seemed rather\na prosaic affair beside this delightful mingling of romance, surprise,\nlove, and fun. 'I declare, I feel as if a weight was off me, but\nwhat the dickens will Nan say when she knows it!' he exclaimed with a\nchuckle.\n\n'Knows what?' asked a clear voice that made both start and turn, for\nthere was Nan calmly surveying them from the doorway.\n\nAnxious to put Tom out of suspense and see how Nan would take the news,\nMrs Jo answered quickly:\n\n'Tom's engagement to Dora West.'\n\n'Really?' and Nan looked so surprised that Mrs Jo was afraid she might\nbe fonder of her old playmate than she knew; but her next words set the\nfear at rest, and made everything comfortable and merry at once.\n\n'I knew my prescription would work wonders if he only took it long\nenough. Dear old Tom, I'm so glad. Bless you! bless you!' And she shook\nboth his hands with hearty affection.\n\n'It was an accident, Nan. I didn't mean to, but I'm always getting into\nmesses, and I couldn't seem to get out of this any other way. Mother\nBhaer will tell you all about it. I must go and make myself tidy. Going\nto tea with Demi. See you later.'\n\nStammering, blushing, and looking both sheepish and gratified, Tom\nsuddenly bolted, leaving the elder lady to enlighten the younger at\nlength, and have another laugh over this new sort of courtship, which\nmight well be called accidental. Nan was deeply interested, for she knew\nDora, thought her a nice little thing, and predicted that in time she\nwould make Tom an excellent wife, since she admired and 'appreciated'\nhim so much.\n\n'I shall miss him of course, but it will be a relief to me and better\nfor him; dangling is so bad for a boy. Now he will go into business\nwith his father and do well, and everyone be happy. I shall give Dora an\nelegant family medicine-chest for a wedding-present, and teach her how\nto use it. Tom can't be trusted, and is no more fit for the profession\nthan Silas.'\n\nThe latter part of this speech relieved Mrs Jo's mind, for Nan had\nlooked about her as if she had lost something valuable when she began;\nbut the medicine-chest seemed to cheer her, and the thought of Tom in a\nsafe profession was evidently a great comfort.\n\n'The worm has turned at last, Nan, and your bond-man is free. Let him\ngo, and give your whole mind to your work; for you are fitted for\nthe profession, and will be an honour to it by and by,' she said\napprovingly.\n\n'I hope so. That reminds me--measles are in the village, and you had\nbetter tell the girls not to call where there are children. It would\nbe bad to have a run of them just as term begins. Now I'm off to Daisy.\nWonder what she will say to Tom. Isn't he great fun?' And Nan departed,\nlaughing over the joke with such genuine satisfaction that it was\nevident no sentimental regrets disturbed her 'maiden meditation,\nfancy-free'.\n\n'I shall have my eye on Demi, but won't say a word. Meg likes to manage\nher children in her own way, and a very good way it is. But the dear\nPelican will be somewhat ruffled if her boy has caught the epidemic\nwhich seems to have broken out among us this summer.'\n\nMrs Jo did not mean the measles, but that more serious malady called\nlove, which is apt to ravage communities, spring and autumn, when winter\ngaiety and summer idleness produce whole bouquets of engagements, and\nset young people to pairing off like the birds. Franz began it, Nat was\na chronic and Tom a sudden case; Demi seemed to have the symptoms; and\nworst of all, her own Ted had only the day before calmly said to her:\n'Mum, I think I should be happier if I had a sweetheart, like the other\nboys.' If her cherished son had asked her for dynamite to play with, she\nwould hardly have been more startled, or have more decidedly refused the\nabsurd request.\n\n'Well, Barry Morgan said I ought to have one and offered to pick me out\na nice one among our set. I asked Josie first, and she hooted at the\nidea, so I thought I'd let Barry look round. You say it steadies a\nfellow, and I want to be steady,' explained Ted in a serious tone, which\nwould have convulsed his parent at any other time.\n\n'Good lack! What are we coming to in this fast age when babes and boys\nmake such demands and want to play with one of the most sacred things in\nlife?' exclaimed Mrs Jo, and having in a few words set the matter in its\ntrue light, sent her son away to wholesome baseball and Octoo for a safe\nsweetheart.\n\nNow, here was Tom's bomb-shell to explode in their midst, carrying\nwidespread destruction, perhaps; for though one swallow does not make a\nsummer, one engagement is apt to make several, and her boys were, most\nof them, at the inflammable age when a spark ignites the flame, which\nsoon flickers and dies out, or burns warm and clear for life. Nothing\ncould be done about it but to help them make wise choices, and be worthy\nof good mates. But of all the lessons Mrs Jo had tried to teach her\nboys, this great one was the hardest; for love is apt to make lunatics\nof even saints and sages, so young people cannot be expected to escape\nthe delusions, disappointments, and mistakes, as well as the delights,\nof this sweet madness.\n\n'I suppose it is inevitable, since we live in America, so I won't borrow\ntrouble, but hope that some of the new ideas of education will produce a\nfew hearty, happy, capable, and intelligent girls for my lads. Lucky for\nme that I haven't the whole twelve on my hands, I should lose my wits if\nI had, for I foresee complications and troubles ahead worse than Tom's\nboats, bicycles, donkeys, and Doras,' meditated Mrs Jo, as she went back\nto her neglected proof-sheets.\n\nTom was quite satisfied with the tremendous effect his engagement\nproduced in the little community at Plumfield.\n\n'It was paralysing,' as Demi said; and astonishment left most of Tom's\nmates little breath for chaff. That he, the faithful one, should turn\nfrom the idol to strange goddesses, was a shock to the romantic and a\nwarning to the susceptible. It was comical to see the airs our Thomas\nput on; for the most ludicrous parts of the affair were kindly buried in\noblivion by the few who knew them, and Tom burst forth as a full-blown\nhero who had rescued the maiden from a watery grave, and won her\ngratitude and love by his daring deed. Dora kept the secret, and enjoyed\nthe fun when she came to see Mother Bhaer and pay her respects to the\nfamily generally. Everyone liked her at once, for she was a gay and\nwinning little soul; fresh, frank, and so happy, it was beautiful to see\nher innocent pride in Tom, who was a new boy, or man rather; for with\nthis change in his life a great change took place in him. Jolly he would\nalways be, and impulsive, but he tried to become all that Dora believed\nhim, and his best side came uppermost for everyday wear. It was\nsurprising to see how many good traits Tom had; and his efforts to\npreserve the manly dignity belonging to his proud position as an engaged\nman was very comical. So was the entire change from his former abasement\nand devotion to Nan to a somewhat lordly air with his little betrothed;\nfor Dora made an idol of him, and resented the idea of a fault or a flaw\nin her Tom. This new state of things suited both, and the once blighted\nbeing bloomed finely in the warm atmosphere of appreciation, love, and\nconfidence. He was very fond of the dear girl, but meant to be a slave\nno longer, and enjoyed his freedom immensely, quite unconscious that the\ngreat tyrant of the world had got hold of him for life.\n\nTo his father's satisfaction he gave up his medical studies, and\nprepared to go into business with the old gentleman, who was a\nflourishing merchant, ready now to make the way smooth and smile upon\nhis marriage with Mr West's well-endowed daughter. The only thorn in\nTom's bed of roses was Nan's placid interest in his affairs, and evident\nrelief at his disloyalty. He did not want her to suffer, but a decent\namount of regret at the loss of such a lover would have gratified him;\na slight melancholy, a word of reproach, a glance of envy as he passed\nwith adoring Dora on his arm, seemed but the fitting tribute to such\nyears of faithful service and sincere affection. But Nan regarded him\nwith a maternal sort of air that nettled him very much, and patted\nDora's curly head with a worldlywise air worthy of the withered\nspinster, Julia Mills, in David Copperfield.\n\nIt took some time to get the old and the new emotions comfortably\nadjusted, but Mrs Jo helped him, and Mr Laurie gave him some wise advice\nupon the astonishing gymnastic feats the human heart can perform, and\nbe all the better for it if it only held fast to the balancing-pole\nof truth and common sense. At last our Tommy got his bearings, and as\nautumn came on Plumfield saw but little of him; for his new lode star\nwas in the city, and business kept him hard at work. He was evidently\nin his right place now, and soon throve finely, to his father's great\ncontentment; for his jovial presence pervaded the once quiet office like\na gale of fresh wind, and his lively wits found managing men and\naffairs much more congenial employment than studying disease, or playing\nunseemly pranks with skeletons.\n\nHere we will leave him for a time and turn to the more serious\nadventures of his mates, though this engagement, so merrily made, was\nthe anchor which kept our mercurial Tom happy, and made a man of him.\n\n\n\nChapter 10. DEMI SETTLES\n\n'Mother, can I have a little serious conversation with you?' asked Demi\none evening, as they sat together enjoying the first fire of the season,\nwhile Daisy wrote letters upstairs and Josie was studying in the little\nlibrary close by.\n\n'Certainly, dear. No bad news, I hope?' and Mrs Meg looked up from her\nsewing with a mixture of pleasure and anxiety on her motherly face; for\nshe dearly loved a good talk with her son, and knew that he always had\nsomething worth telling.\n\n'It will be good news for you, I think,' answered Demi, smiling as he\nthrew away his paper and went to sit beside her on the little sofa which\njust held two.\n\n'Let me hear it, then, at once.'\n\n'I know you don't like the reporting, and will be glad to hear that I\nhave given it up.'\n\n'I am very glad! It is too uncertain a business, and there is no\nprospect of getting on for a long time. I want you settled in some good\nplace where you can stay, and in time make money. I wish you liked a\nprofession; but as you don't, any clean, well-established business will\ndo.'\n\n'What do you say to a railroad office?'\n\n'I don't like it. A noisy, hurried kind of place, I know, with all sorts\nof rough men about. I hope it isn't that, dear?'\n\n'I could have it; but does book-keeping in a wholesale leather business\nplease you better?'\n\n'No; you'll get round-shouldered writing at a tall desk; and they say,\nonce a book-keeper always a book-keeper.'\n\n'How does a travelling agent suit your views?'\n\n'Not at all; with all those dreadful accidents, and the exposure and bad\nfood as you go from place to place, you are sure to get killed or lose\nyour health.'\n\n'I could be private secretary to a literary man; but the salary is\nsmall, and may end any time.'\n\n'That would be better, and more what I want. It isn't that I object to\nhonest work of any kind; but I don't want my son to spend his best years\ngrubbing for a little money in a dark office, or be knocked about in a\nrough-and-tumble scramble to get on. I want to see you in some business\nwhere your tastes and talents can be developed and made useful; where\nyou can go on rising, and in time put in your little fortune and be a\npartner; so that your years of apprenticeship will not be wasted, but\nfit you to take your place among the honourable men who make their\nlives and work useful and respected. I talked it all over with your dear\nfather when you were a child; and if he had lived he would have shown\nyou what I mean, and helped you to be what he was.'\n\nMrs Meg wiped away a quiet tear as she spoke; for the memory of her\nhusband was a very tender one, and the education of his children had\nbeen a sacred task to which she gave all her heart and life, and so\nfar she had done wonderfully well--as her good son and loving daughters\ntried to prove. Demi's arm was round her now, as he said, in a voice so\nlike his father's that it was the sweetest music to her ear:\n\n'Mother dear, I think I have got just what you want for me; and it shall\nnot be my fault if I don't become the man you hope to see me. Let me\ntell you all about it. I didn't say anything till it was sure because it\nwould only worry you; but Aunt Jo and I have been on the look-out for it\nsome time, and now it has come. You know her publisher, Mr Tiber, is one\nof the most successful men in the business; also generous, kind, and\nthe soul of honour--as his treatment of Aunty proves. Well, I've rather\nhankered for that place; for I love books, and as I can't make them I'd\nlike to publish them. That needs some literary taste and judgement, it\nbrings you in contact with fine people, and is an education in itself.\nWhenever I go into that large, handsome room to see Mr Tiber for Aunt\nJo, I always want to stay; for it's lined with books and pictures,\nfamous men and women come and go, and Mr Tiber sits at his desk like\na sort of king, receiving his subjects; for the greatest authors are\nhumble to him, and wait his Yes or No with anxiety. Of course I've\nnothing to do with all that, and may never have; but I like to see it,\nand the atmosphere is so different from the dark offices and hurly-burly\nof many other trades, where nothing but money is talked about, that it\nseems another world, and I feel at home in it. Yes, I'd rather beat the\ndoor-mats and make fires there than be head clerk in the great hide and\nleather store at a big salary.' Here Demi paused for breath; and Mrs\nMeg, whose face had been growing brighter and brighter, exclaimed\neagerly:\n\n'Just what I should like! Have you got it? Oh, my dear boy! your fortune\nis made if you go to that well-established and flourishing place, with\nthose good men to help you along!'\n\n'I think I have, but we mustn't be too sure of anything yet. I may not\nsuit; I'm only on trial, and must begin at the beginning and work my way\nup faithfully. Mr Tiber was very kind, and will push me on as fast as\nis fair to the other fellows, and as I prove myself fit to go up. I'm to\nbegin the first of next month in the book-room, filling orders; and I\ngo round and get orders, and do various other things of the sort. I like\nit. I am ready to do anything about books, if it's only to dust them,'\nlaughed Demi, well pleased with his prospects, for, after trying various\nthings, he seemed at last to have found the sort of work he liked, and a\nprospect that was very inviting to him.\n\n'You inherit that love of books from grandpa; he can't live without\nthem. I'm glad of it. Tastes of that kind show a refined nature, and are\nboth a comfort and a help all one's life. I am truly glad and grateful,\nJohn, that at last you want to settle, and have got such an entirely\nsatisfactory place. Most boys begin much earlier; but I don't believe\nin sending them out to face the world so young, just when body and soul\nneed home care and watchfulness. Now you are a man, and must begin your\nlife for yourself. Do your best, and be as honest, useful, and happy as\nyour father, and I won't care about making a fortune.'\n\n'I'll try, mother. Couldn't have a better chance; for Tiber & Co. treat\ntheir people like gentlemen, and pay generously for faithful work.\nThings are done in a businesslike way there, and that suits me. I hate\npromises that are not kept, and shiftless or tyrannical ways anywhere.\nMr Tiber said: \"This is only to teach you the ropes, Brooke; I shall\nhave other work for you by and by.\" Aunty told him I had done book\nnotices, and had rather a fancy for literature; so though I can't\nproduce any \"works of Shakespeare\", as she says, I may get up some\nlittle things later. If I don't, I think it a very honourable and noble\nprofession to select and give good books to the world; and I'm satisfied\nto be a humble helper in the work.'\n\n'I'm glad you feel so. It adds so much to one's happiness to love the\ntask one does. I used to hate teaching; but housekeeping for my own\nfamily was always sweet, though much harder in many ways. Isn't Aunt Jo\npleased about all this?' asked Mrs Meg, already seeing in her mind's\neye a splendid sign with 'Tiber, Brooke & Co.' over the door of a famous\npublishing house.\n\n'So pleased that I could hardly keep her from letting the cat out of the\nbag too soon. I've had so many plans, and disappointed you so often, I\nwanted to be very sure this time. I had to bribe Rob and Ted to keep her\nat home tonight till I'd told my news, she was eager to rush down and\ntell you herself. The castles that dear woman has built for me would\nfill all Spain, and have kept us jolly while we waited to know our fate.\nMr Tiber doesn't do things in a hurry; but when he makes up his mind,\nyou are all right; and I feel that I am fairly launched.'\n\n'Bless you, dear, I hope so! It is a happy day for me, because I've been\nso anxious lest, with all my care, I have been too easy and indulgent,\nand my boy, with his many good gifts, might fritter his time away in\nharmless but unsatisfactory things. Now I am at ease about you. If\nonly Daisy can be happy, and Josie give up her dream, I shall be quite\ncontented.'\n\nDemi let his mother enjoy herself for a few minutes, while he smiled\nover a certain little dream of his own, not ready yet for the telling;\nthen he said, in the paternal tone which he unconsciously used when\nspeaking of his sisters:\n\n'I'll see to the girls; but I begin to think grandpa is right in\nsaying we must each be what God and nature makes us. We can't change it\nmuch--only help to develop the good and control the bad elements in us.\nI have fumbled my way into my right place at last, I hope. Let Daisy be\nhappy in her way, since it is a good and womanly one. If Nat comes home\nall right, I'd say: \"Bless you, my children,\" and give them a nest of\ntheir own. Then you and I will help little Jo to find out if it is to be\n\"All the world's a stage\" or \"Home, sweet home\", for her.'\n\n'I suppose we must, John; but I can't help making plans, and hoping they\nwill come to pass. I see that Daisy is bound up in Nat; and if he is\nworthy of her I shall let them be happy in their own way, as my parents\nlet me. But Josie will be a trial, I foresee; and much as I love the\nstage, and always did, I don't see how I can ever let my little girl be\nan actress, though she certainly has great talent for it.'\n\n'Whose fault is that?' asked Demi, smiling, as he remembered his\nmother's early triumphs and unquenchable interest in the dramatic\nefforts of the young people round her.\n\n'Mine, I know. How could it be otherwise when I acted Babes in the Wood\nwith you and Daisy before you could speak, and taught Josie to declaim\nMother Goose in her cradle. Ah, me! the tastes of the mother come out in\nher children, and she must atone for them by letting them have their own\nway, I suppose.' And Mrs Meg laughed, even while she shook her head over\nthe undeniable fact that the Marches were a theatrical family.\n\n'Why not have a great actress of our name, as well as an authoress, a\nminister, and an eminent publisher? We don't choose our talents, but we\nneedn't hide them in a napkin because they are not just what we want. I\nsay, let Jo have her way, and do what she can. Here am I to take care of\nher; and you can't deny you'd enjoy fixing her furbelows, and seeing her\nshine before the footlights, where you used to long to be. Come, mother,\nbetter face the music and march gaily, since your wilful children will\n\"gang their ain gait\".'\n\n'I don't see but I must, and \"leave the consequences to the Lord\", as\nMarmee used to say when she had to decide, and only saw a step of the\nroad. I should enjoy it immensely, if I could only feel that the life\nwould not hurt my girl, and leave her unsatisfied when it was too late\nto change; for nothing is harder to give up than the excitements of that\nprofession. I know something of it; and if your blessed father had not\ncome along, I'm afraid I should have been an actress in spite of Aunt\nMarch and all our honoured ancestors.'\n\n'Let Josie add new honour to the name, and work out the family talent\nin its proper place. I'll play dragon to her, and you play nurse, and\nno harm can come to our little Juliet, no matter how many Romeos spoon\nunder her balcony. Really, ma'am, opposition comes badly from an old\nlady who is going to wring the hearts of our audience in the heroine's\npart in Aunty's play next Christmas. It's the most pathetic thing I\never saw, mother; and I'm sorry you didn't become an actress, though we\nshould be nowhere if you had.'\n\nDemi was on his legs now, with his back to the fire, in the lordly\nattitude men like to assume when things go well with them, or they want\nto lay down the law on any subject.\n\nMrs Meg actually blushed at her son's hearty praise, and could not\ndeny that the sound of applause was as sweet now as when she played the\nWitch's Curse and The Moorish Maiden's Vow long years ago.\n\n'It's perfectly absurd for me to do it, but I couldn't resist when Jo\nand Laurie made the part for me, and you children were to act in it. The\nminute I get on the old mother's dress I forget myself and feel the same\nthrill at the sound of the bell that I used to feel when we got up plays\nin the garret. If Daisy would only take the daughter's part it would\nbe so complete; for with you and Josie I am hardly acting, it is all so\nreal.'\n\n'Especially the hospital scene, where you find the wounded son. Why,\nmother, do you know when we did that at last rehearsal my face was wet\nwith real tears as you cried over me. It will bring down the house; but\ndon't forget to wipe 'em off, or I shall sneeze,' said Demi, laughing at\nthe recollection of his mother's hit.\n\n'I won't; but it almost broke my heart to see you so pale and dreadful.\nI hope there will never be another war in my time, for I should have to\nlet you go; and I never want to live through the same experience we had\nwith father.'\n\n'Don't you think Alice does the part better than Daisy would? Daisy\nhasn't a bit of the actress in her, and Alice puts life into the dullest\nwords she speaks. I think the Marquise is just perfect in our piece,'\nsaid Demi, strolling about the room as if the warmth of the fire sent a\nsudden colour to his face.\n\n'So do I. She is a dear girl, and I'm proud and fond of her. Where is\nshe tonight?'\n\n'Pegging away at her Greek, I suppose. She usually is in the evening.\nMore's the pity,' added Demi, in a low tone, as he stared intently at\nthe book-case, though he couldn't read a title.\n\n'Now, there is a girl after my own heart. Pretty, well-bred,\nwell-educated, and yet domestic, a real companion as well as help-meet\nfor some good and intelligent man. I hope she will find one.'\n\n'So do I,' muttered Demi.\n\nMrs Meg had taken up her work again, and was surveying a half-finished\nbuttonhole with so much interest that her son's face escaped her eye. He\nshed a beaming smile upon the rows of poets, as if even in their glass\nprison they could sympathize and rejoice with him at the first rosy dawn\nof the great passion which they knew so well. But Demi was a wise youth,\nand never leaped before looking carefully. He hardly knew his own heart\nyet, and was contented to wait till the sentiment, the fluttering of\nthose folded wings he began to feel, should escape from the chrysalis\nand be ready to soar away in the sunshine to seek and claim its lovely\nmate. He had said nothing; but the brown eyes were eloquent, and there\nwas an unconscious underplot to all the little plays he and Alice Heath\nacted so well together. She was busy with her books, bound to graduate\nwith high honours, and he was trying to do the same in that larger\ncollege open to all, and where each man has his own prize to win or\nlose. Demi had nothing but himself to offer and, being a modest youth,\nconsidered that a poor gift till he had proved his power to earn his\nliving, and the right to take a woman's happiness into his keeping.\n\nNo one guessed that he had caught the fever except sharp-eyed Josie, and\nshe, having a wholesome fear of her brother--who could be rather awful\nwhen she went too far--wisely contented herself with watching him like a\nlittle cat, ready to pounce on the first visible sign of weakness. Demi\nhad taken to playing pensively upon his flute after he was in his\nroom for the night, making this melodious friend his confidante, and\nbreathing into it all the tender hopes and fears that filled his heart.\nMrs Meg, absorbed in domestic affairs, and Daisy, who cared for no music\nbut Nat's violin, paid no heed to these chamber concerts, but Josie\nalways murmured to herself, with a naughty chuckle, 'Dick Swiveller is\nthinking of his Sophy Wackles,' and bided her time to revenge certain\nwrongs inflicted upon her by Demi, who always took Daisy's side when she\ntried to curb the spirits of her unruly little sister.\n\nThis evening she got her chance, and made the most of it. Mrs Meg was\njust rounding off her buttonhole, and Demi still strolling restlessly\nabout the room, when a book was heard to slam in the study, followed by\nan audible yawn and the appearance of the student looking as if sleep\nand a desire for mischief were struggling which should be master.\n\n'I heard my name; have you been saying anything bad about me?' she\ndemanded, perching on the arm of an easychair.\n\nHer mother told the good news, over which Josie duly rejoiced, and Demi\nreceived her congratulations with a benignant air which made her feel\nthat too much satisfaction was not good for him, and incited her to put\na thorn into his bed of roses at once.\n\n'I caught something about the play just now, and I want to tell you that\nI'm going to introduce a song into my part to liven it up a bit. How\nwould this do?' and seating herself at the piano she began to sing to\nthese words the air of 'Kathleen Mavourneen':\n\n    'Sweetest of maidens, oh, how can I tell\n     The love that transfigures the whole earth to me?\n     The longing that causes my bosom to swell,\n     When I dream of a life all devoted to thee?'\n\nShe got no further, for Demi, red with wrath, made a rush at her, and\nthe next moment a very agile young person was seen dodging round tables\nand chairs with the future partner of Tiber & Co. in hot pursuit. 'You\nmonkey, how dare you meddle with my papers?' cried the irate poet,\nmaking futile grabs at the saucy girl, who skipped to and fro, waving a\nbit of paper tantalizingly before him.\n\n'Didn't; found it in the big \"Dic\". Serves you right if you leave your\nrubbish about. Don't you like my song? It's very pretty.'\n\n'I'll teach you one that you won't like if you don't give me my\nproperty.'\n\n'Come and get it if you can'; and Josie vanished into the study to have\nout her squabble in peace, for Mrs Meg was already saying:\n\n'Children, children! don't quarrel.'\n\nThe paper was in the fire by the time Demi arrived and he at once calmed\ndown, seeing that the bone of contention was out of the way.\n\n'I'm glad it's burnt; I don't care for it, only some verse I was trying\nto set to music for one of the girls. But I'll trouble you to let my\npapers alone, or I shall take back the advice I gave mother tonight\nabout allowing you to act as much as you like.'\n\nJosie was sobered at once by this dire threat, and in her most wheedling\ntone begged to know what he had said. By way of heaping coals of fire\non her head he told her, and this diplomatic performance secured him an\nally on the spot.\n\n'You dear old boy! I'll never tease you again though you moon and spoon\nboth day and night. If you stand by me, I'll stand by you and never say\na word. See here! I've got a note for you from Alice. Won't that be a\npeace-offering and soothe your little feelings?'\n\nDemi's eyes sparkled as Josie held up a paper cocked hat, but as he\nknew what was probably in it, he took the wind out of Josie's sails, and\nfilled her with blank astonishment by saying carelessly:\n\n'That's nothing; it's only to say whether she will go to the concert\nwith us tomorrow night. You can read it if you like.'\n\nWith the natural perversity of her sex Josie ceased to be curious the\nmoment she was told to read it, and meekly handed it over; but she\nwatched Demi as he calmly read the two lines it contained and then threw\nit into the fire. 'Why, Jack, I thought you'd treasure every scrap the\n\"sweetest maid\" touched. Don't you care for her?'\n\n'Very much; we all do; but \"mooning and spooning\", as you elegantly\nexpress it, is not in my line. My dear little girl, your plays make you\nromantic, and because Alice and I act lovers sometimes you take it into\nyour silly head that we are really so. Don't waste time hunting mares\nnests, but attend to your own affairs and leave me to mine. I forgive\nyou, but don't do it again; it's bad taste, and tragedy queens don't\nromp.'\n\nThe last cut finished Josie; she humbly begged pardon and went off to\nbed, while Demi soon followed, feeling that he had not only settled\nhimself but his too inquisitive little sister also. But if he had seen\nher face as she listened to the soft wailing of his flute he would not\nhave been so sure, for she looked as cunning as a magpie as she said,\nwith a scornful sniff: 'Pooh, you can't deceive me; I know Dick is\nserenading Sophy Wackles.'\n\n\n\nChapter 11. EMIL'S THANKSGIVING\n\nThe Brenda was scudding along with all sail set to catch the rising\nwind, and everyone on board was rejoicing, for the long voyage was\ndrawing towards an end.\n\n'Four weeks more, Mrs Hardy, and we'll give you a cup of tea such as you\nnever had before,' said second mate Hoffmann, as he paused beside two\nladies sitting in a sheltered corner of the deck.\n\n'I shall be glad to get it, and still gladder to put my feet on solid\nground,' answered the elder lady, smiling; for our friend Emil was\na favourite, as well he might be, since he devoted himself to the\ncaptain's wife and daughter, who were the only passengers on board.\n\n'So shall I, even if I have to wear a pair of shoes like Chinese junks.\nI've tramped up and down the deck so much, I shall be barefooted if\nwe don't arrive soon,' laughed Mary, the daughter, showing two shabby\nlittle boots as she glanced up at the companion of these tramps,\nremembering gratefully how pleasant he had made them.\n\n'Don't think there are any small enough in China,' answered Emil, with a\nsailor's ready gallantry, privately resolving to hunt up the handsomest\nshoes he could find the moment he landed.\n\n'I don't know what you would have done for exercise, dear, if Mr\nHoffmann had not made you walk every day. This lazy life is bad for\nyoung people, though it suits an old body like me well enough in calm\nweather. Is this likely to be a gale, think ye?' added Mrs Hardy, with\nan anxious glance at the west, where the sun was setting redly.\n\n'Only a capful of wind, ma'am, just enough to send us along lively,'\nanswered Emil, with a comprehensive glance aloft and alow.\n\n'Please sing, Mr Hoffmann, it's so pleasant to have music at this\ntime. We shall miss it very much when we get ashore,' said Mary, in\na persuasive tone which would have won melody from a shark, if such a\nthing were possible.\n\nEmil had often blessed his one accomplishment during these months, for\nit cheered the long days, and made the twilight hour his happiest\ntime, wind and weather permitting. So now he gladly tuned his pipe, and\nleaning on the taffrail near the girl, watched the brown locks blowing\nin the wind as he sang her favourite song:\n\n    'Give me freshening breeze, my boys,\n     A white and swelling sail,\n     A ship that cuts the dashing waves,\n     And weathers every gale.\n     What life is like a sailor's life,\n     So free, so bold, so brave?\n     His home the ocean's wide expanse,\n     A coral bed his grave.'\n\nJust as the last notes of the clear, strong voice died away, Mrs Hardy\nsuddenly exclaimed: 'What's that?' Emil's quick eye saw at once the\nlittle puff of smoke coming up a hatchway where no smoke should be, and\nhis heart seemed to stand still for an instant as the dread word 'Fire!'\nflashed through his mind. Then he was quite steady, and strolled away\nsaying quietly:\n\n'Smoking not allowed there, I'll go and stop it.' But the instant he\nwas out of sight his face changed, and he leaped down the hatchway,\nthinking, with a queer smile on his lips: 'If we are afire, shouldn't\nwonder if I did make a coral bed my grave!'\n\nHe was gone a few minutes, and when he came up, half stifled with smoke,\nhe was as white as a very brown man could be, but calm and cool as he\nwent to report to the captain.\n\n'Fire in the hold, sir.'\n\n'Don't frighten the women,' was Captain Hardy's first order; then both\nbe stirred themselves to discover how strong the treacherous enemy was,\nand to rout it if possible.\n\nThe Brenda's cargo was a very combustible one, and in spite of the\nstreams of water poured into the hold it was soon evident that the ship\nwas doomed. Smoke began to ooze up between the planks everywhere, and\nthe rising gale soon fanned the smouldering fire to flames that began\nto break out here and there, telling the dreadful truth too plainly for\nanyone to hide. Mrs Hardy and Mary bore the shock bravely when told to\nbe ready to quit the ship at a minute's notice; the boats were hastily\nprepared, and the men worked with a will to batten down every loophole\nwhence the fire might escape. Soon the poor Brenda was a floating\nfurnace, and the order to 'Take to the boats!' came for all. The women\nfirst, of course, and it was fortunate that, being a merchantman, there\nwere no more passengers on board, so there was no panic, and one after\nthe other the boats pushed off. That in which the women were lingered\nnear, for the brave captain would be the last to leave his ship.\n\nEmil stayed by him till ordered away, and reluctantly obeyed; but it was\nwell for him he went, for just as he had regained the boat, rocking far\nbelow, half hidden by a cloud of smoke, a mast, undermined by the\nfire now raging in the bowels of the ship, fell with a crash, knocking\nCaptain Hardy overboard. The boat soon reached him as he floated out\nfrom the wreck, and Emil sprung into the sea to rescue him, for he was\nwounded and senseless. This accident made it necessary for the young man\nto take command, and he at once ordered the men to pull for their lives,\nas an explosion might occur at any moment.\n\nThe other boats were out of danger and all lingered to watch the\nsplendid yet awesome spectacle of the burning ship alone on the wide\nsea, reddening the night and casting a lurid glare upon the water, where\nfloated the frail boats filled with pale faces, all turned for a last\nlook at the fated Brenda, slowly settling to her watery grave. No one\nsaw the end, however, for the gale soon swept the watchers far away and\nseparated them, some never to meet again till the sea gives up its dead.\n\nThe boat whose fortunes we must follow was alone when dawn came up,\nshowing these survivors all the dangers of their situation. Food and\nwater had been put in, and such provision for comfort and safety as time\nallowed; but it was evident that with a badly wounded man, two women,\nand seven sailors, their supply would not last long, and help was sorely\nneeded. Their only hope was in meeting a ship, although the gale, which\nhad raged all night, had blown them out of their course. To this hope\nall clung, and wiled away the weary hours, watching the horizon and\ncheering one another with prophecies of speedy rescue.\n\nSecond mate Hoffmann was very brave and helpful, though his unexpected\nresponsibility weighed heavily on his shoulders; for the captain's state\nseemed desperate, the poor wife's grief wrung his heart, and the blind\nconfidence of the young girl in his power to save them made him feel\nthat no sign of doubt or fear must lessen it. The men did their part\nreadily now, but Emil knew that if starvation and despair made brutes of\nthem, his task might be a terrible one. So he clutched his courage with\nboth hands, kept up a manly front, and spoke so cheerily of their good\nchances, that all instinctively turned to him for guidance and support.\n\nThe first day and night passed in comparative comfort, but when the\nthird came, things looked dark and hope began to fail. The wounded man\nwas delirious, the wife worn out with anxiety and suspense, the girl\nweak for want of food, having put away half her biscuit for her mother,\nand given her share of water to wet her father's feverish lips. The\nsailors ceased rowing and sat grimly waiting, openly reproaching their\nleader for not following their advice, others demanding more food, all\nwaxing dangerous as privation and pain brought out the animal instincts\nlurking in them. Emil did his best, but mortal man was helpless there,\nand he could only turn his haggard face from the pitiless sky, that\ndropped no rain for their thirst, to the boundless sea where no sail\nappeared to gladden their longing eyes. All day he tried to cheer and\ncomfort them, while hunger gnawed, thirst parched, and growing fear lay\nheavy at his heart. He told stories to the men, implored them to bear up\nfor the helpless women's sake, and promised rewards if they would pull\nwhile they had strength to regain the lost route, as nearly as he could\nmake it out, and increase their chance of rescue. He rigged an awning\nof sailcloth over the suffering man and tended him like a son, comforted\nthe wife, and tried to make the pale girl forget herself, by singing\nevery song he knew or recounting his adventures by land and sea, till\nshe smiled and took heart; for all ended well.\n\nThe fourth day came and the supply of food and water was nearly gone.\nEmil proposed to keep it for the sick man and the women, but two of the\nmen rebelled, demanding their share. Emil gave up his as an example, and\nseveral of the good fellows followed it, with the quiet heroism which so\noften crops up in rough but manly natures. This shamed the others,\nand for another day an ominous peace reigned in that little world of\nsuffering and suspense. But during the night, while Emil, worn out with\nfatigue, left the watch to the most trustworthy sailor, that he might\nsnatch an hour's rest, these two men got at the stores and stole the\nlast of the bread and water, and the one bottle of brandy, which was\ncarefully hoarded to keep up their strength and make the brackish water\ndrinkable. Half mad with thirst, they drank greedily and by morning one\nwas in a stupor, from which he never woke; the other so crazed by\nthe strong stimulant, that when Emil tried to control him, he leaped\noverboard and was lost. Horror-stricken by this terrible scene, the\nother men were submissive henceforth, and the boat floated on and on\nwith its sad freight of suffering souls and bodies.\n\nAnother trial came to them that left all more despairing than before. A\nsail appeared, and for a time a frenzy of joy prevailed, to be turned\nto bitterest disappointment when it passed by, too far away to see\nthe signals waved to them or hear the frantic cries for help that rang\nacross the sea. Emil's heart sank then, for the captain seemed dying,\nand the women could not hold out much longer. He kept up till night\ncame; then in the darkness, broken only by the feeble murmuring of the\nsick man, the whispered prayers of the poor wife, the ceaseless swash of\nwaves, Emil hid his face, and had an hour of silent agony that aged him\nmore than years of happy life could have done. It was not the physical\nhardship that daunted him, though want and weakness tortured him; it was\nhis dreadful powerlessness to conquer the cruel fate that seemed hanging\nover them. The men he cared little for, since these perils were but a\npart of the life they chose; but the master he loved, the good woman who\nhad been so kind to him, the sweet girl whose winsome presence had made\nthe long voyage so pleasant for them all--if he could only save these\ndear and innocent creatures from a cruel death, he felt that he could\nwillingly give his life for them.\n\nAs he sat there with his head in his hands, bowed down by the first\ngreat trial of his young life, the starless sky overhead, the restless\nsea beneath, and all around him suffering, for which he had no help, a\nsoft sound broke the silence, and he listened like one in a dream. It\nwas Mary singing to her mother, who lay sobbing in her arms, spent with\nthis long anguish. A very faint and broken voice it was, for the poor\ngirl's lips were parched with thirst; but the loving heart turned\ninstinctively to the great Helper in this hour of despair, and He heard\nher feeble cry. It was a sweet old hymn often sung at Plumfield; and as\nhe listened, all the happy past came back so clearly that Emil forgot\nthe bitter present, and was at home again. His talk on the housetop\nwith Aunt Jo seemed but yesterday, and, with a pang of self-reproach, he\nthought:\n\n'The scarlet strand! I must remember it, and do my duty to the end.\nSteer straight, old boy; and if you can't come into port, go down with\nall sail set.'\n\nThen, as the soft voice crooned on to lull the weary woman to a\nfitful sleep, Emil for a little while forgot his burden in a dream of\nPlumfield. He saw them all, heard the familiar voices, felt the grip of\nwelcoming hands, and seemed to say to himself: 'Well, they shall not be\nashamed of me if I never see them any more.'\n\nA sudden shout startled him from that brief rest, and a drop on his\nforehead told him that the blessed rain had come at last, bringing\nsalvation with it; for thirst is harder to bear than hunger, heat, or\ncold. Welcomed by cries of joy, all lifted up their parched lips, held\nout their hands, and spread their garments to catch the great drops that\nsoon came pouring down to cool the sick man's fever, quench the agony of\nthirst, and bring refreshment to every weary body in the boat. All night\nit fell, all night the castaways revelled in the saving shower, and took\nheart again, like dying plants revived by heaven's dew. The clouds broke\naway at dawn, and Emil sprung up, wonderfully braced and cheered by\nthose hours of silent gratitude for this answer to their cry for help.\nBut this was not all; as his eye swept the horizon, clear against the\nrosy sky shone the white sails of a ship, so near that they could see\nthe pennon at her mast-head and black figures moving on the deck.\n\nOne cry broke from all those eager throats, and rang across the sea, as\nevery man waved hat or handkerchief and the women stretched imploring\nhands towards this great white angel of deliverance coming down upon\nthem as if the fresh wind filled every sail to help her on.\n\nNo disappointment now; answering signals assured them of help; and in\nthe rapture of that moment the happy women fell on Emil's neck,\ngiving him his reward in tears and blessings as their grateful hearts\noverflowed. He always said that was the proudest moment of his life,\nas he stood there holding Mary in his arms; for the brave girl, who had\nkept up so long, broke down then, and clung to him half fainting; while\nher mother busied herself about the invalid, who seemed to feel the\njoyful stir, and gave an order, as if again on the deck of his lost\nship.\n\nIt was soon over; and then all were safely aboard the good Urania,\nhomeward bound. Emil saw his friends in tender hands, his men among\ntheir mates, and told the story of the wreck before he thought of\nhimself. The savoury odour of the soup, carried by to the cabin for the\nladies, reminded him that he was starving, and a sudden stagger\nbetrayed his weakness. He was instantly borne away, to be half killed by\nkindness, and being fed, clothed, and comforted, was left to rest. Just\nas the surgeon left the state-room, he asked in his broken voice: 'What\nday is this? My head is so confused, I've lost my reckoning.'\n\n'Thanksgiving Day, man! And we'll give you a regular New England dinner,\nif you'll eat it,' answered the surgeon heartily.\n\nBut Emil was too spent to do anything, except lie still and give thanks,\nmore fervently and gratefully than ever before, for the blessed gift of\nlife, which was the sweeter for a sense of duty faithfully performed.\n\n\n\nChapter 12. DAN'S CHRISTMAS\n\nWhere was Dan? In prison. Alas for Mrs Jo! how her heart would have\nached if she had known that while old Plum shone with Christmas cheer\nher boy sat alone in his cell, trying to read the little book she\ngave him, with eyes dimmed now and then by the hot tears no physical\nsuffering had ever wrung from him, and longing with a homesick heart for\nall that he had lost.\n\nYes, Dan was in prison; but no cry for help from him as he faced the\nterrible strait he was in with the dumb despair of an Indian at the\nstake; for his own bosom sin had brought him there, and this was to\nbe the bitter lesson that tamed the lawless spirit and taught him\nself-control.\n\nThe story of his downfall is soon told; for it came, as so often\nhappens, just when he felt unusually full of high hopes, good\nresolutions, and dreams of a better life. On his journey he met a\npleasant young fellow, and naturally felt an interest in him, as\nBlair was on his way to join his elder brothers on a ranch in Kansas.\nCard-playing was going on in the smoking-car, and the lad--for he was\nbarely twenty--tired with the long journey, beguiled the way with such\npartners as appeared, being full of spirits, and a little intoxicated\nwith the freedom of the West. Dan, true to his promise, would not join,\nbut watched with intense interest the games that went on, and soon made\nup his mind that two of the men were sharpers anxious to fleece the boy,\nwho had imprudently displayed a well-filled pocket-book. Dan always had\na soft spot in his heart for any younger, weaker creature whom he met,\nand something about the lad reminded him of Teddy; so he kept an eye on\nBlair, and warned him against his new friends.\n\nVainly, of course; for when all stopped overnight in one of the great\ncities, Dan missed the boy from the hotel whither he had taken him\nfor safe-keeping; and learning who had come for him, went to find him,\ncalling himself a fool for his pains, yet unable to leave the confiding\nboy to the dangers that surrounded him.\n\nHe found him gambling in a low place with the men, who were bound to\nhave his money; and by the look of relief on Blair's anxious face when\nhe saw him Dan knew without words that things were going badly with him,\nand he saw the peril too late.\n\n'I can't come yet--I've lost; it's not my money; I must get it back, or\nI dare not face my brothers,' whispered the poor lad, when Dan begged\nhim to get away without further loss. Shame and fear made him desperate;\nand he played on, sure that he could recover the money confided to\nhis care. Seeing Dan's resolute face, keen eye, and travelled air, the\nsharpers were wary, played fair, and let the boy win a little; but they\nhad no mind to give up their prey, and finding that Dan stood sentinel\nat the boy's back, an ominous glance was exchanged between them, which\nmeant:\n\n'We must get this fellow out of the way.'\n\nDan saw it, and was on his guard; for he and Blair were strangers, evil\ndeeds are easily done in such places, and no tales told. But he would\nnot desert the boy, and still kept watch of every card till he plainly\ndetected false play, and boldly said so. High words passed, Dan's\nindignation overcame his prudence; and when the cheat refused to restore\nhis plunder with insulting words and drawn pistol, Dan's hot temper\nflashed out, and he knocked the man down with a blow that sent him\ncrashing head first against a stove, to roll senseless and bleeding to\nthe floor. A wild scene followed, but in the midst of it Dan whispered\nto the boy: 'Get away, and hold your tongue. Don't mind me.'\n\nFrightened and bewildered, Blair quitted the city at once, leaving Dan\nto pass the night in the lock-up, and a few days later to stand in court\ncharged with manslaughter; for the man was dead. Dan had no friends, and\nhaving once briefly told the story, held his peace, anxious to keep all\nknowledge of this sad affair from those at home. He even concealed his\nname--giving that of David Kent, as he had done several times before in\nemergencies. It was all over very soon; but as there were extenuating\ncircumstances his sentence was a year in prison, with hard labour.\n\nDazed by the rapidity with which this horrible change in his life came\nupon him, Dan did not fully realize it till the iron door clanged behind\nhim and he sat alone in a cell as narrow, cold, and silent as a tomb. He\nknew that a word would bring Mr Laurie to help and comfort him; but he\ncould not bear to tell of this disgrace, or see the sorrow and the shame\nit would cause the friends who hoped so much for him.\n\n'No,' he said, clenching his fist, 'I'll let them think me dead first.\nI shall be if I am kept here long'; and he sprang up to pace the stone\nfloor like a caged lion, with a turmoil of wrath and grief, rebellion\nand remorse, seething in heart and brain, till he felt as if he should\ngo mad and beat upon the walls that shut him away from the liberty which\nwas his life. For days he suffered terribly, then worn out, sank into a\nblack melancholy sadder to see than his excitement.\n\nThe warden of this prison was a rough man who had won the ill will of\nall by unnecessary harshness, but the chaplain was full of sympathy, and\ndid his hard duty faithfully and tenderly. He laboured with poor Dan,\nbut seemed to make no impression, and was forced to wait till work had\nsoothed the excited nerves and captivity tamed the proud spirit that\nwould suffer but not complain.\n\nDan was put in the brush-shop, and feeling that activity was his only\nsalvation, worked with a feverish energy that soon won the approval of\nthe master and the envy of less skilful mates. Day after day he sat in\nhis place, watched by an armed overseer, forbidden any but necessary\nwords, no intercourse with the men beside him, no change but from cell\nto shop, no exercise but the dreary marches to and fro, each man's hand\non the other's shoulder keeping step with the dreary tramp so different\nfrom the ringing tread of soldiers. Silent, gaunt, and grim, Dan did his\ndaily task, ate his bitter bread, and obeyed commands with a rebellious\nflash of the eye, that made the warden say:\n\n'That's a dangerous man. Watch him. He'll break out some day.'\n\nThere were others more dangerous than he, because older in crime\nand ready for any desperate outbreak to change the monotony of long\nsentences. These men soon divined Dan's mood, and in the mysterious way\nconvicts invent, managed to convey to him before a month was over\nthat plans were being made for a mutiny at the first opportunity.\nThanksgiving Day was one of the few chances for them to speak together\nas they enjoyed an hour of freedom in the prison yard. Then all would\nbe settled and the rash attempt made if possible, probably to end in\nbloodshed and defeat for most, but liberty for a few. Dan had already\nplanned his own escape and bided his time, growing more and more moody,\nfierce, and rebellious, as loss of liberty wore upon soul and body; for\nthis sudden change from his free, healthy life to such a narrow, gloomy,\nand miserable one, could not but have a terrible effect upon one of\nDan's temperament and age.\n\nHe brooded over his ruined life, gave up all his happy hopes and plans,\nfelt that he could never face dear old Plumfield again, or touch those\nfriendly hands, with the stain of blood upon his own. He did not care\nfor the wretched man whom he had killed, for such a life was better\nended, he thought; but the disgrace of prison would never be wiped out\nof his memory, though the cropped hair would grow again, the grey suit\neasily be replaced, and the bolts and bars left far behind.\n\n'It's all over with me; I've spoilt my life, now let it go. I'll give up\nthe fight and get what pleasure I can anywhere, anyhow. They shall think\nme dead and so still care for me, but never know what I am. Poor Mother\nBhaer! she tried to help me, but it's no use; the firebrand can't be\nsaved.'\n\nAnd dropping his head in his hands as he sat on his low bed, Dan would\nmourn over all he had lost in tearless misery, till merciful sleep would\ncomfort him with dreams of the happy days when the boys played together,\nor those still later and happier ones when all smiled on him, and\nPlumfield seemed to have gained a new and curious charm.\n\nThere was one poor fellow in Dan's shop whose fate was harder than his,\nfor his sentence expired in the spring, but there was little hope of his\nliving till that time; and the coldest-hearted man pitied poor Mason as\nhe sat coughing his life away in that close place and counting the weary\ndays yet to pass before he could see his wife and little child again.\nThere was some hope that he might be pardoned out, but he had no friends\nto bestir themselves in the matter, and it was evident that the great\nJudge's pardon would soon end his patient pain for ever.\n\nDan pitied him more than he dared to show, and this one tender emotion\nin that dark time was like the little flower that sprung up between the\nstones of the prison yard and saved the captive from despair, in the\nbeautiful old story. Dan helped Mason with his work when he was too\nfeeble to finish his task, and the grateful look that thanked him was\na ray of sunshine to cheer his cell when he was alone. Mason envied the\nsplendid health of his neighbour, and mourned to see it wasting there.\nHe was a peaceful soul and tried, as far as a whispered word or warning\nglance could do it, to deter Dan from joining the 'bad lot', as the\nrebels were called. But having turned his face from the light, Dan found\nthe downward way easy, and took a grim satisfaction in the prospect of\na general outbreak during which he might revenge himself upon the\ntyrannical warden, and strike a blow for his own liberty, feeling that\nan hour of insurrection would be a welcome vent for the pent-up passions\nthat tormented him. He had tamed many a wild animal, but his own lawless\nspirit was too much for him, till he found the curb that made him master\nof himself.\n\nThe Sunday before Thanksgiving, as he sat in chapel, Dan observed\nseveral guests in the seats reserved for them, and looked anxiously\nto see if any familiar face was there; for he had a mortal fear that\nsomeone from home would suddenly confront him. No, all were strangers,\nand he soon forgot them in listening to the chaplain's cheerful words,\nand the sad singing of many heavy hearts. People often spoke to the\nconvicts, so it caused no surprise when, on being invited to address\nthem, one of the ladies rose and said she would tell them a little\nstory; which announcement caused the younger listeners to pack up their\nears, and even the older ones to look interested; for any change in\ntheir monotonous life was welcome.\n\nThe speaker was a middle-aged woman in black, with a sympathetic face,\neyes full of compassion, and a voice that seemed to warm the heart,\nbecause of certain motherly tones in it. She reminded Dan of Mrs Jo, and\nhe listened intently to every word, feeling that each was meant for him,\nbecause by chance, they came at the moment when he needed a softening\nmemory to break up the ice of despair which was blighting all the good\nimpulses of his nature.\n\nIt was a very simple little story, but it caught the men's attention at\nonce, being about two soldiers in a hospital during the late war,\nboth badly wounded in the right arm, and both anxious to save these\nbreadwinners and go home unmaimed. One was patient, docile, and\ncheerfully obeyed orders, even when told that the arm must go. He\nsubmitted and after much suffering recovered, grateful for life, though\nhe could fight no more. The other rebelled, would listen to no advice,\nand having delayed too long, died a lingering death, bitterly regretting\nhis folly when it was too late. 'Now, as all stories should have a\nlittle moral, let me tell you mine,' added the lady, with a smile, as\nshe looked at the row of young men before her, sadly wondering what\nbrought them there.\n\n'This is a hospital for soldiers wounded in life's battle; here are sick\nsouls, weak wills, insane passions, blind consciences, all the ills that\ncome from broken laws, bringing their inevitable pain and punishment\nwith them, There is hope and help for every one, for God's mercy is\ninfinite and man's charity is great; but penitence and submission must\ncome before the cure is possible. Pay the forfeit manfully, for it is\njust; but from the suffering and shame wring new strength for a nobler\nlife. The scar will remain, but it is better for a man to lose both arms\nthan his soul; and these hard years, instead of being lost, may be made\nthe most precious of your lives, if they teach you to rule yourselves. O\nfriends, try to outlive the bitter past, to wash the sin away, and begin\nanew. If not for your own sakes, for that of the dear mothers, wives,\nand children, who wait and hope so patiently for you. Remember them,\nand do not let them love and long in vain. And if there be any here\nso forlorn that they have no friend to care for them, never forget the\nFather whose arms are always open to receive, forgive, and comfort\nHis prodigal sons, even at the eleventh hour.' There the little sermon\nended; but the preacher of it felt that her few hearty words had not\nbeen uttered in vain, for one boy's head was down, and several faces\nwore the softened look which told that a tender memory was touched. Dan\nwas forced to set his lips to keep them steady, and drop his eyes to\nhide the sudden dew that dimmed them when waiting, hoping friends were\nspoken of. He was glad to be alone in his cell again, and sat thinking\ndeeply, instead of trying to forget himself in sleep. It seemed as if\nthose words were just what he needed to show him where he stood and how\nfateful the next few days might be to him. Should he join the 'bad lot',\nand perhaps add another crime to the one already committed, lengthen the\nsentence already so terrible to bear, deliberately turn his back on all\nthat was good, and mar the future that might yet be redeemed? Or should\nhe, like the wiser man in the story, submit, bear the just punishment,\ntry to be better for it; and though the scar would remain, it might\nserve as a reminder of a battle not wholly lost, since he had saved his\nsoul though innocence was gone? Then he would dare go home, perhaps,\nconfess, and find fresh strength in the pity and consolation of those\nwho never gave him up.\n\nGood and evil fought for Dan that night as did the angel and the devil\nfor Sintram, and it was hard to tell whether lawless nature or loving\nheart would conquer. Remorse and resentment, shame and sorrow, pride and\npassion, made a battle-field of that narrow cell, and the poor fellow\nfelt as if he had fiercer enemies to fight now than any he had met in\nall his wanderings. A little thing turned the scale, as it so often does\nin these mysterious hearts of ours, and a touch of sympathy helped Dan\ndecide the course which would bless or ban his life.\n\nIn the dark hour before the dawn, as he lay wakeful on his bed, a ray\nof light shone through the bars, the bolts turned softly, and a man came\nin. It was the good chaplain, led by the same instinct that brings a\nmother to her sick child's pillow; for long experience as nurse of souls\nhad taught him to see the signs of hope in the hard faces about him,\nand to know when the moment came for a helpful word and the cordial\nof sincere prayer that brings such comfort and healing to tried and\ntroubled hearts. He had been to Dan before at unexpected hours, but\nalways found him sullen, indifferent, or rebellious, and had gone away\nto patiently bide his time. Now it had come; a look of relief was in the\nprisoner's face as the light shone on it, and the sound of a human\nvoice was strangely comfortable after listening to the whispers of\nthe passions, doubts, and fears which had haunted the cell for hours,\ndismaying Dan by their power, and showing him how much he needed help to\nfight the good fight, since he had no armour of his own.\n\n'Kent, poor Mason has gone. He left a message for you, and I felt\nimpelled to come and give it now, because I think you were touched by\nwhat we heard today, and in need of the help Mason tried to give you,'\nsaid the chaplain, taking the one seat and fixing his kind eyes on the\ngrim figure in the bed.\n\n'Thank you, sir, I'd like to hear it,' was all Dan's answer; but he\nforgot himself in pity for the poor fellow dead in prison, with no last\nlook at wife or child.\n\nHe went suddenly, but remembered you, and begged me to say these words:\n\"Tell him not to do it, but to hold on, do his best, and when his time\nis out go right to Mary, and she'll make him welcome for my sake. He's\ngot no friends in these parts and will feel lonesome, but a woman's\nalways safe and comfortable when a fellow's down on his luck. Give him\nmy love and good-bye for he was kind to me, and God will bless him for\nit.\" Then he died quietly, and tomorrow will go home with God's pardon,\nsince man's came too late.'\n\nDan said nothing, but laid his arm across his face and lay quite still.\nSeeing that the pathetic little message had done its work even better\nthan he hoped, the chaplain went on, unconscious how soothing his\npaternal voice was to the poor prisoner who longed to 'go home', but\nfelt he had forfeited the right.\n\n'I hope you won't disappoint this humble friend whose last thought was\nfor you. I know that there is trouble brewing, and fear that you may be\ntempted to lend a hand on the wrong side. Don't do it, for the plot will\nnot succeed--it never does--and it would be a pity to spoil your record\nwhich is fair so far. Keep up your courage, my son, and go out at the\nyear's end better, not worse, for this hard experience. Remember a\ngrateful woman waits to welcome and thank you if you have no friends of\nyour own; if you have, do your best for their sake, and let us ask God\nto help you as He only can.'\n\nThen waiting for no answer the good man prayed heartily, and Dan\nlistened as he never had before; for the lonely hour, the dying message,\nthe sudden uprising of his better self, made it seem as if some kind\nangel had come to save and comfort him. After that night there was a\nchange in Dan, though no one knew it but the chaplain; for to all the\nrest he was the same silent, stern, unsocial fellow as before, and\nturning his back on the bad and the good alike, found his only pleasure\nin the books his friend brought him. Slowly, as the steadfast drop wears\naway the rock, the patient kindness of this man won Dan's confidence,\nand led by him he began to climb out of the Valley of Humiliation\ntowards the mountains, whence, through the clouds, one can catch\nglimpses of the Celestial City whither all true pilgrims sooner or\nlater turn their wistful eyes and stumbling feet. There were many\nback-slidings, many struggles with Giant Despair and fiery Apollyon,\nmany heavy hours when life did not seem worth living and Mason's escape\nthe only hope. But through all, the grasp of a friendly hand, the sound\nof a brother's voice, the unquenchable desire to atone for the past by a\nbetter future, and win the right to see home again, kept poor Dan to his\ngreat task as the old year drew to its end, and the new waited to turn\nanother leaf in the book whose hardest lesson he was learning now.\n\nAt Christmas he yearned so for Plumfield that he devised a way to send a\nword of greeting to cheer their anxious hearts, and comfort his own. He\nwrote to Mary Mason, who lived in another State, asking her to mail the\nletter he enclosed. In it he merely said he was well and busy, had given\nup the farm, and had other plans which he would tell later; would not\nbe home before autumn probably, nor write often, but was all right, and\nsent love and merry Christmas to everyone.\n\nThen he took up his solitary life again, and tried to pay his forfeit\nmanfully.\n\n\n\nChapter 13. NAT'S NEW YEAR\n\n'I don't expect to hear from Emil yet, and Nat writes regularly, but\nwhere is Dan? Only two or three postals since he went. Such an energetic\nfellow as he is could buy up all the farms in Kansas by this time,' said\nMrs Jo one morning when the mail came in and no card or envelope bore\nDan's dashing hand.\n\n'He never writes often, you know, but does his work and then comes\nhome. Months and years seem to mean little to him, and he is probably\nprospecting in the wilderness, forgetful of time,' answered Mr Bhaer,\ndeep in one of Nat's long letters from Leipzig.\n\n'But he promised he would let me know how he got on, and Dan keeps his\nword if he can. I'm afraid something has happened to him'; and Mrs Jo\ncomforted herself by patting Don's head, as he came at the sound of his\nmaster's name to look at her with eyes almost human in their wistful\nintelligence.\n\n'Don't worry, Mum dear, nothing ever happens to the old fellow. He'll\nturn up all right, and come stalking in some day with a gold-mine in one\npocket and a prairie in the other, as jolly as a grig,' said Ted, who\nwas in no haste to deliver Octoo to her rightful owner.\n\n'Perhaps he has gone to Montana and given up the farm plan. He seemed to\nlike Indians best, I thought'; and Rob went to help his mother with her\npile of letters and his cheerful suggestions.\n\n'I hope so, it would suit him best. But I am sure he would have told us\nhis change of plan and sent for some money to work with. No, I feel in\nmy prophetic bones that something is wrong,' said Mrs Jo, looking as\nsolemn as Fate in a breakfast-cap.\n\n'Then we shall hear; ill news always travels fast. Don't borrow trouble,\nJo, but hear how well Nat is getting on. I'd no idea the boy would care\nfor anything but music. My good friend Baumgarten has launched him well,\nand it will do him good if he lose not his head. A good lad, but new to\nthe world, and Leipzig is full of snares for the unwary. Gott be with\nhim!'\n\nThe Professor read Nat's enthusiastic account of certain literary\nand musical parties he had been to, the splendours of the opera, the\nkindness of his new friends, the delight of studying under such a master\nas Bergmann, his hopes of rapid gain, and his great gratitude to those\nwho had opened this enchanted world to him.\n\n'That, now, is satisfactory and comfortable. I felt that Nat had\nunsuspected power in him before he went away; he was so manly and full\nof excellent plans,' said Mrs Jo, in a satisfied tone.\n\n'We shall see. He will doubtless get his lesson and be the better for\nit. That comes to us all in our young days. I hope it will not be too\nhard for our good Jungling,' answered the Professor, with a wise smile,\nremembering his own student life in Germany.\n\nHe was right; and Nat was already getting his lesson in life with a\nrapidity which would have astonished his friends at home. The manliness\nover which Mrs Jo rejoiced was developing in unexpected ways, and quiet\nNat had plunged into the more harmless dissipations of the gay city\nwith all the ardour of an inexperienced youth taking his first sip of\npleasure. The entire freedom and sense of independence was delicious,\nfor many benefits began to burden him, and he longed to stand on his\nown legs and make his own way. No one knew his past here; and with a\nwell-stocked wardrobe, a handsome sum at his banker's, and the best\nteacher in Leipzig, he made his debut as a musical young gentleman,\npresented by the much-respected Professor Bhaer and the wealthy Mr\nLaurence, who had many friends glad to throw open their houses to\nhis protege. Thanks to these introductions, his fluent German, modest\nmanners, and undeniable talent, the stranger was cordially welcomed, and\nlaunched at once into a circle which many an ambitious young man strove\nin vain to enter.\n\nAll this rather turned Nat's head; and as he sat in the brilliant\nopera-house, chatted among the ladies at some select coffee-party, or\nwhisked an eminent professor's amiable daughter down the room, trying to\nimagine she was Daisy, he often asked himself if this gay fellow could\nbe the poor homeless little Street musician who once stood waiting in\nthe rain at the gates of Plumfield. His heart was true, his impulses\ngood, and his ambitions high; but the weak side of his nature came\nuppermost here; vanity led him astray, pleasure intoxicated him, and for\na time he forgot everything but the delights of this new and charming\nlife. Without meaning to deceive, he allowed people to imagine him a\nyouth of good family and prospects; he boasted a little of Mr Laurie's\nwealth and influence, of Professor Bhaer's eminence, and the flourishing\ncollege at which he himself had been educated. Mrs Jo was introduced to\nthe sentimental Frauleins who read her books, and the charms and virtues\nof his own dear Madchen confided to sympathetic mammas. All these boyish\nboastings and innocent vanities were duly circulated among the\ngossips, and his importance much increased thereby, to his surprise and\ngratification, as well as some shame.\n\nBut they bore fruit that was bitter in the end; for, finding that he was\nconsidered one of the upper class, it very soon became impossible\nfor him to live in the humble quarters he had chosen, or to lead the\nstudious, quiet life planned for him. He met other students, young\nofficers, and gay fellows of all sorts, and was flattered at being\nwelcomed among them; though it was a costly pleasure, and often left\na thorn of regret to vex his honest conscience. He was tempted to take\nbetter rooms in a more fashionable street, leaving good Frau Tetzel to\nlament his loss, and his artist neighbour, Fraulein Vogelstein, to shake\nher grey ringlets and predict his return, a sadder and a wiser man.\n\nThe sum placed at his disposal for expenses and such simple pleasures\nas his busy life could command seemed a fortune to Nat, though it was\nsmaller than generous Mr Laurie first proposed. Professor Bhaer wisely\ncounselled prudence, as Nat was unused to the care of money, and the\ngood man knew the temptations that a well-filled purse makes possible at\nthis pleasure-loving age. So Nat enjoyed his handsome little apartment\nimmensely, and insensibly let many unaccustomed luxuries creep in. He\nloved his music and never missed a lesson; but the hours he should\nhave spent in patient practice were too often wasted at theatre, ball,\nbeer-garden, or club--doing no harm beyond that waste of precious time,\nand money not his own; for he had no vices, and took his recreation like\na gentleman, so far. But slowly a change for the worse was beginning to\nshow itself, and he felt it. These first steps along the flowery road\nwere downward, not upward; and the constant sense of disloyalty which\nsoon began to haunt him made Nat feel, in the few quiet hours he gave\nhimself, that all was not well with him, spite of the happy whirl in\nwhich he lived.\n\n'Another month, and then I will be steady,' he said more than once,\ntrying to excuse the delay by the fact that all was new to him, that his\nfriends at home wished him to be happy, and that society was giving him\nthe polish he needed. But as each month slipped away it grew harder to\nescape; he was inevitably drawn on, and it was so easy to drift with\nthe tide that he deferred the evil day as long as possible. Winter\nfestivities followed the more wholesome summer pleasures, and Nat found\nthem more costly; for the hospitable ladies expected some return from\nthe stranger; and carriages, bouquets, theatre tickets, and all the\nlittle expenses a young man cannot escape at such times, told heavily\non the purse which seemed bottomless at first. Taking Mr Laurie for\nhis model, Nat became quite a gallant, and was universally liked; for\nthrough all the newly acquired airs and graces the genuine honesty\nand simplicity of his character plainly shone, winning confidence and\naffection from all who knew him.\n\nAmong these was a certain amiable old lady with a musical\ndaughter--well-born but poor, and very anxious to marry the aforesaid\ndaughter to some wealthy man. Nat's little fictions concerning his\nprospects and friends charmed the gnadige Frau as much as his music and\ndevoted manners did the sentimental Minna. Their quiet parlour seemed\nhomelike and restful to Nat, when tired of gayer scenes; and the\nmotherly interest of the elder lady was sweet and comfortable to him;\nwhile the tender blue eyes of the pretty girl were always so full of\nwelcome when he came, of regret when he left, and of admiration when\nhe played to her, that he found it impossible to keep away from this\nattractive spot. He meant no harm, and feared no danger, having confided\nto the Frau Mamma that he was betrothed; so he continued to call, little\ndreaming what ambitious hopes the old lady cherished, nor the peril\nthere was in receiving the adoration of a romantic German girl, till it\nwas too late to spare her pain and himself great regret.\n\nOf course some inkling of these new and agreeable experiences got into\nthe voluminous letters he never was too gay, too busy, or too tired\nto write each week; and while Daisy rejoiced over his happiness and\nsuccess, and the boys laughed at the idea of 'old Chirper coming out as\na society man', the elders looked sober, and said among themselves:\n\n'He is going too fast; he must have a word of warning, or trouble may\ncome.'\n\nBut Mr Laurie said: 'Oh, let him have his fling; he's been dependent and\nrepressed long enough. He can't go far with the money he has, and I've\nno fear of his getting into debt. He's too timid and too honest to be\nreckless. It is his first taste of freedom; let him enjoy it, and he'll\nwork the better by and by; I know--and I'm sure I'm right.'\n\nSo the warnings were very gentle, and the good people waited anxiously\nto hear more of hard study, and less of 'splendid times'. Daisy\nsometimes wondered, with a pang of her faithful heart, if one of the\ncharming Minnas, Hildegardes, and Lottchens mentioned were not stealing\nher Nat away from her; but she never asked, always wrote calmly and\ncheerfully, and looked in vain for any hint of change in the letters\nthat were worn out with much reading.\n\nMonth after month slipped away, till the holidays came with gifts, good\nwishes, and brilliant festivities. Nat expected to enjoy himself very\nmuch, and did at first; for a German Christmas is a spectacle worth\nseeing. But he paid dearly for the abandon with which he threw himself\ninto the gaieties of that memorable week; and on New Year's Day the\nreckoning came. It seemed as if some malicious fairy had prepared the\nsurprises that arrived, so unwelcome were they, so magical the change\nthey wrought, turning his happy world into a scene of desolation and\ndespair as suddenly as a transformation at the pantomime.\n\nThe first came in the morning when, duly armed with costly bouquets\nand bon-bons, he went to thank Minna and her mother for the braces\nembroidered with forget-me-nots and the silk socks knit by the old\nlady's nimble fingers, which he had found upon his table that day. The\nFrau Mamma received him graciously; but when he asked for the daughter\nthe good lady frankly demanded what his intentions were, adding that\ncertain gossip which had reached her ear made it necessary for him\nto declare himself or come no more, as Minna's peace must not be\ncompromised.\n\nA more panic-stricken youth was seldom seen than Nat as he received this\nunexpected demand. He saw too late that his American style of gallantry\nhad deceived the artless girl, and might be used with terrible effect\nby the artful mother, if she chose to do it. Nothing but the truth could\nsave him, and he had the honour and honesty to tell it faithfully. A\nsad scene followed; for Nat was obliged to strip off his fictitious\nsplendour, confess himself only a poor student, and humbly ask pardon\nfor the thoughtless freedom with which he had enjoyed their too\nconfiding hospitality. If he had any doubts of Frau Schomburg's motives\nand desires, they were speedily set at rest by the frankness with which\nshe showed her disappointment, the vigour with which she scolded him,\nand the scorn with which she cast him off when her splendid castles in\nthe air collapsed.\n\nThe sincerity of Nat's penitence softened her a little and she consented\nto a farewell word with Minna, who had listened at the keyhole, and was\nproduced drenched in tears, to fall on Nat's bosom, crying: 'Ah, thou\ndear one, never can I forget thee, though my heart is broken!'\n\nThis was worse than the scolding; for the stout lady also wept, and it\nwas only after much German gush and twaddle that he escaped, feeling\nlike another Werther; while the deserted Lotte consoled herself with the\nbonbons, her mother with the more valuable gifts.\n\nThe second surprise arrived as he dined with Professor Baumgarten. His\nappetite had been effectually taken away by the scene of the morning,\nand his spirits received another damper when a fellow student cheerfully\ninformed him that he was about to go to America, and should make it his\nagreeable duty to call on the 'lieber Herr Professor Bhaer', to tell\nhim how gaily his protege was disporting himself at Leipzig. Nat's heart\ndied within him as he imagined the effect these glowing tales would have\nat Plumfield--not that he had wilfully deceived them, but in his letters\nmany things were left untold; and when Carlsen added, with a friendly\nwink, that he would merely hint at the coming betrothal of the fair\nMinna and his 'heart's friend', Nat found himself devoutly hoping that\nthis other inconvenient heart's friend might go to the bottom of the sea\nbefore he reached Plumfield to blast all his hopes by these tales of a\nmis-spent winter. Collecting his wits, he cautioned Carlsen with what\nhe flattered himself was Mephistophelian art, and gave him such confused\ndirections that it would be a miracle if he ever found Professor Bhaer.\nBut the dinner was spoilt for Nat, and he got away as soon as possible,\nto wander disconsolately about the streets, with no heart for the\ntheatre or the supper he was to share with some gay comrades afterwards.\nHe comforted himself a little by giving alms to sundry beggars, making\ntwo children happy with gilded gingerbread, and drinking a lonely glass\nof beer, in which he toasted his Daisy and wished himself a better year\nthan the last had been.\n\nGoing home at length, he found a third surprise awaiting him in the\nshower of bills which had descended upon him like a snowstorm, burying\nhim in an avalanche of remorse, despair, and self-disgust. These bills\nwere so many and so large that he was startled and dismayed; for, as\nMr Bhaer wisely predicted, he knew little about the value of money.\nIt would take every dollar at the bankers to pay them all at once, and\nleave him penniless for the next six months, unless he wrote home for\nmore. He would rather starve than do that; and his first impulse was to\nseek help at the gaming-table, whither his new friends had often tempted\nhim. But he had promised Mr Bhaer to resist what then had seemed an\nimpossible temptation; and now he would not add another fault to the\nlist already so long. Borrow he would not, nor beg. What could he do?\nFor these appalling bills must be paid, and the lessons go on; or his\njourney was an ignominious failure. But he must live meantime. And how?\nBowed down with remorse for the folly of these months, he saw too late\nwhither he was drifting, and for hours paced up and down his pretty\nrooms, floundering in a Slough of Despond, with no helping hand to pull\nhim out--at least he thought so till letters were brought in, and among\nfresh bills lay one well-worn envelope with an American stamp in the\ncorner.\n\nAh, how welcome it was! how eagerly he read the long pages full of\naffectionate wishes from all at home! For everyone had sent a line, and\nas each familiar name appeared, his eyes grew dimmer and dimmer till, as\nhe read the last--'God bless my boy! Mother Bhaer'--he broke down; and\nlaying his head on his arms, blistered the paper with a rain of tears\nthat eased his heart and washed away the boyish sins that now lay so\nheavy on his conscience.\n\n'Dear people, how they love and trust me! And how bitterly they would\nbe disappointed if they knew what a fool I've been! I'll fiddle in the\nstreets again before I'll ask for help from them!' cried Nat, brushing\naway the tears of which he was ashamed, although he felt the good they\nhad done.\n\nNow he seemed to see more clearly what to do; for the helping hand had\nbeen stretched across the sea, and Love, the dear Evangelist, had\nlifted him out of the slough and shown him the narrow gate, beyond which\ndeliverance lay. When the letter had been reread, and one corner where\na daisy was painted, passionately kissed, Nat felt strong enough to face\nthe worst and conquer it. Every bill should be paid, every salable thing\nof his own sold, these costly rooms given up; and once back with\nthrifty Frau Tetzel, he would find work of some sort by which to support\nhimself, as many another student did. He must give up the new friends,\nturn his back on the gay life, cease to be a butterfly, and take his\nplace among the grubs. It was the only honest thing to do, but very hard\nfor the poor fellow to crush his little vanities, renounce the delights\nso dear to the young, own his folly, and step down from his pedestal to\nbe pitied, laughed at, and forgotten.\n\nIt took all Nat's pride and courage to do this, for his was a sensitive\nnature; esteem was very precious to him, failure very bitter, and\nnothing but the inborn contempt for meanness and deceit kept him from\nasking help or trying to hide his need by some dishonest device. As he\nsat alone that night, Mr Bhaer's words came back to him with curious\nclearness, and he saw himself a boy again at Plumfield, punishing his\nteacher as a lesson to himself, when timidity had made him lie.\n\n'He shall not suffer for me again, and I won't be a sneak if I am a\nfool. I'll go and tell Professor Baumgarten all about it and ask his\nadvice. I'd rather face a loaded cannon; but it must be done. Then I'll\nsell out, pay my debts, and go back where I belong. Better be an honest\npauper than a jackdaw among peacocks'; and Nat smiled in the midst of\nhis trouble, as he looked about him at the little elegancies of his\nroom, remembering what he came from.\n\nHe kept his word manfully, and was much comforted to find that his\nexperience was an old story to the professor, who approved his plan,\nthinking wisely that the discipline would be good for him, and was very\nkind in offering help and promising to keep the secret of his folly from\nhis friend Bhaer till Nat had redeemed himself.\n\nThe first week of the new year was spent by our prodigal in carrying out\nhis plan with penitent dispatch, and his birthday found him alone in\nthe little room high up at Frau Tetzel's, with nothing of his former\nsplendour, but sundry unsalable keepsakes from the buxom maidens, who\nmourned his absence deeply. His male friends had ridiculed, pitied,\nand soon left him alone, with one or two exceptions, who offered their\npurses generously and promised to stand by him. He was lonely and\nheavy-hearted, and sat brooding over his small fire as he remembered the\nlast New Year's Day at Plumfield, when at this hour he was dancing with\nhis Daisy.\n\nA tap at the door roused him, and with a careless 'Herein', he waited\nto see who had climbed so far for his sake. It was the good Frau proudly\nbearing a tray, on which stood a bottle of wine and an astonishing\ncake bedecked with sugar-plums of every hue, and crowned with candles.\nFraulein Vogelstein followed, embracing a blooming rose-tree, above\nwhich her grey curls waved and her friendly face beamed joyfully as she\ncried:\n\n'Dear Herr Blak, we bring you greetings and a little gift or two in\nhonour of this ever-to-be-remembered day. Best wishes! and may the new\nyear bloom for you as beautifully as we your heart-warm friends desire.'\n\n'Yes, yes, in truth we do, dear Herr,' added Frau Tetzel. 'Eat of this\nwith-joy-made Kuchen, and drink to the health of the far-away beloved\nones in the good wine.'\n\nAmused, yet touched by the kindness of the good souls, Nat thanked them\nboth, and made them stay to enjoy the humble feast with him. This they\ngladly did, being motherly women full of pity for the dear youth, whose\nstraits they knew, and having substantial help to offer, as well as kind\nwords and creature comforts.\n\nFrau Tetzel, with some hesitation, mentioned a friend of hers who,\nforced by illness to leave his place in the orchestra of a second-rate\ntheatre, would gladly offer it to Nat, if he could accept so humble a\nposition. Blushing and toying with the roses like a shy girl, good old\nVogelstein asked if in his leisure moments he could give English lessons\nin the young ladies' school where she taught painting, adding that a\nsmall but certain salary would be paid him.\n\nGratefully Nat accepted both offers, finding it less humiliating to be\nhelped by women than by friends of his own sex. This work would support\nhim in a frugal way, and certain musical drudgery promised by his master\nassured his own teaching. Delighted with the success of their little\nplot, these friendly neighbours left him with cheery words, warm\nhand-grasps, and faces beaming with feminine satisfaction at the hearty\nkiss Nat put on each faded cheek, as the only return he could make for\nall their helpful kindness.\n\nIt was strange how much brighter the world looked after that; for hope\nwas a better cordial than the wine, and good resolutions bloomed as\nfreshly as the little rose-tree that filled the room with fragrance, as\nNat woke the echoes with the dear old airs, finding now as always his\nbest comforter in music, to whom henceforth he swore to be a more loyal\nsubject.\n\n\n\nChapter 14. PLAYS AT PLUMFIELD\n\nAs it is as impossible for the humble historian of the March family to\nwrite a story without theatricals in it as for our dear Miss Yonge to\nget on with less than twelve or fourteen children in her interesting\ntales, we will accept the fact, and at once cheer ourselves after\nthe last afflicting events, by proceeding to the Christmas plays at\nPlumfield; for they influence the fate of several of our characters, and\ncannot well be skipped.\n\nWhen the college was built Mr Laurie added a charming little theatre\nwhich not only served for plays, but declamations, lectures, and\nconcerts. The drop-curtain displayed Apollo with the Muses grouped about\nhim; and as a compliment to the donor of the hall the artist had given\nthe god a decided resemblance to our friend, which was considered\na superb joke by everyone else. Home talent furnished stars, stock\ncompany, orchestra, and scene painter; and astonishing performances were\ngiven on this pretty little stage.\n\nMrs Jo had been trying for some time to produce a play which should\nbe an improvement upon the adaptations from the French then in vogue,\ncurious mixtures of fine toilettes, false sentiment, and feeble wit,\nwith no touch of nature to redeem them. It was easy to plan plays full\nof noble speeches and thrilling situations, but very hard to write them;\nso she contented herself with a few scenes of humble life in which the\ncomic and pathetic were mingled; and as she fitted her characters to\nher actors, she hoped the little venture would prove that truth and\nsimplicity had not entirely lost their power to charm. Mr Laurie helped\nher, and they called themselves Beaumont and Fletcher, enjoying their\njoint labour very much; for Beaumont's knowledge of dramatic art was\nof great use in curbing Fletcher's too-aspiring pen, and they flattered\nthemselves that they had produced a neat and effective bit of work as an\nexperiment.\n\nAll was ready now; and Christmas Day was much enlivened by last\nrehearsals, the panics of timid actors, the scramble for forgotten\nproperties, and the decoration of the theatre. Evergreen and holly from\nthe woods, blooming plants from the hothouse on Parnassus, and flags of\nall nations made it very gay that night in honour of the guests who were\ncoming, chief among them, Miss Cameron, who kept her promise\nfaithfully. The orchestra tuned their instruments with unusual care,\nthe scene-shifters set their stage with lavish elegance, the prompter\nheroically took his seat in the stifling nook provided for him, and\nthe actors dressed with trembling hands that dropped the pins, and\nperspiring brows whereon the powder wouldn't stick. Beaumont and\nFletcher were everywhere, feeling that their literary reputation was\nat stake; for sundry friendly critics were invited, and reporters, like\nmosquitoes, cannot be excluded from any earthly scene, be it a great\nman's death-bed or a dime museum.\n\n'Has she come?' was the question asked by every tongue behind the\ncurtain; and when Tom, who played an old man, endangered his respectable\nlegs among the footlights to peep, announced that he saw Miss Cameron's\nhandsome head in the place of honour, a thrill pervaded the entire\ncompany, and Josie declared with an excited gasp that she was going to\nhave stage fright for the first time in her life.\n\n'I'll shake you if you do,' said Mrs Jo, who was in such a wild state\nof dishevelment with her varied labours that she might have gone on as\nMadge Wildlife, without an additional rag or crazy elf-lock.\n\n'You'll have time to get your wits together while we do our piece. We\nare old stagers and calm as clocks,' answered Demi, with a nod towards\nAlice, ready in her pretty dress and all her properties at hand.\n\nBut both clocks were going rather faster than usual, as heightened\ncolour, brilliant eyes, and a certain flutter under the laces and velvet\ncoat betrayed. They were to open the entertainment with a gay little\npiece which they had played before and did remarkably well. Alice was\na tall girl, with dark hair and eyes, and a face which intelligence,\nhealth, and a happy heart made beautiful. She was looking her best now,\nfor the brocades, plumes, and powder of the Marquise became her stately\nfigure; and Demi in his court suit, with sword, three-cornered hat, and\nwhite wig, made as gallant a Baron as one would wish to see. Josie was\nthe maid, and looked her part to the life, being as pretty, pert,\nand inquisitive as any French soubrette. These three were all the\ncharacters; and the success of the piece depended on the spirit and\nskill with which the quickly changing moods of the quarrelsome lovers\nwere given, their witty speeches made to tell, and by-play suited to the\ncourtly period in which the scene was laid.\n\nFew would have recognized sober John and studious Alice in the dashing\ngentleman and coquettish lady, who kept the audience laughing at their\ncaprices; while they enjoyed the brilliant costumes, and admired the\nease and grace of the young actors. Josie was a prominent figure in the\nplot, as she listened at keyholes, peeped into notes, and popped in and\nout at all the most inopportune moments, with her nose in the air, her\nhands in her apron-pockets, and curiosity pervading her little figure\nfrom the topmost bow of her jaunty cap to the red heels of her slippers.\nAll went smoothly; and the capricious Marquise, after tormenting the\ndevoted Baron to her heart's content, owned herself conquered in the war\nof wits, and was just offering the hand he had fairly won, when a crash\nstartled them, and a heavily decorated side-scene swayed forward, ready\nto fall upon Alice. Demi saw it and sprung before her to catch and hold\nit up, standing like a modern Samson with the wall of a house on his\nback. The danger was over in a moment, and he was about to utter his\nlast speech, when the excited young scene-shifter, who had flown up a\nladder to repair the damage, leaned over to whisper 'All right', and\nrelease Demi from his spread-eagle attitude: as he did so, a hammer\nslipped out of his pocket, to fall upon the upturned face below,\ninflicting a smart blow and literally knocking the Baron's part out of\nhis head.\n\n'A quick curtain,' robbed the audience of a pretty little scene not down\non the bill; for the Marquise flew to staunch the blood with a cry of\nalarm: 'Oh! John, you are hurt! Lean on me'--which John gladly did for a\nmoment, being a trifle dazed yet quite able to enjoy the tender touch of\nthe hands busied about him and the anxiety of the face so near his own;\nfor both told him something which he would have considered cheaply won\nby a rain of hammers and the fall of the whole college on his head.\n\nNan was on the spot in a moment with the case that never left her\npocket; and the wound was neatly plastered up by the time Mrs Jo\narrived, demanding tragically:\n\n'Is he too much hurt to go on again? If he is, my play is lost!'\n\n'I'm all the fitter for it, Aunty; for here's a real instead of a\npainted wound. I'll be ready; don't worry about me.' And catching up\nhis wig, Demi was off, with only a very eloquent look of thanks to the\nMarquise, who had spoilt her gloves for his sake, but did not seem to\nmind it at all, though they reached above her elbows, and were most\nexpensive.\n\n'How are your nerves, Fletcher?' asked Mr Laurie as they stood together\nduring the breathless minute before the last bell rings.\n\n'About as calm as yours, Beaumont,' answered Mrs Jo, gesticulating\nwildly to Mrs Meg to set her cap straight.\n\n'Bear up, partner! I'll stand by you whatever comes!'\n\n'I feel that it ought to go; for, though it's a mere trifle, a good deal\nof honest work and truth have gone into it. Doesn't Meg look the picture\nof a dear old country woman?'\n\nShe certainly did, as she sat in the farmhouse kitchen by a cheery fire,\nrocking a cradle and darning stockings, as if she had done nothing else\nall her life. Grey hair, skilfully drawn lines on the forehead, and a\nplain gown, with cap, little shawl, and check apron, changed her into a\ncomfortable, motherly creature who found favour the moment the curtain\nwent up and discovered her rocking, darning, and crooning an old song.\nIn a short soliloquy about Sam, her boy, who wanted to enlist;\nDolly, her discontented little daughter, who longed for city ease and\npleasures; and poor 'Elizy', who had married badly, and came home to\ndie, bequeathing her baby to her mother, lest its bad father should\nclaim it, the little story was very simply opened, and made effective\nby the real boiling of the kettle on the crane, the ticking of a tall\nclock, and the appearance of a pair of blue worsted shoes which\nwaved fitfully in the air to the soft babble of a baby's voice. Those\nshapeless little shoes won the first applause; and Mr Laurie, forgetting\nelegance in satisfaction, whispered to his coadjutor:\n\n'I thought the baby would fetch them!'\n\n'If the dear thing won't squall in the wrong place, we are saved. But\nit is risky. Be ready to catch it if all Meg's cuddlings prove in vain,'\nanswered Mrs Jo, adding, with a clutch at Mr Laurie's arm as a haggard\nface appeared at the window:\n\n'Here's Demi! I hope no one will recognize him when he comes on as the\nson. I'll never forgive you for not doing the villain yourself.'\n\n'Can't run the thing and act too. He's capitally made up, and likes a\nbit of melodrama.'\n\n'This scene ought to have come later; but I wanted to show that the\nmother was the heroine as soon as possible. I'm tired of love-sick girls\nand runaway wives. We'll prove that there's romance in old women also.\nNow he's coming!'\n\nAnd in slouched a degraded-looking man, shabby, unshaven, and evil-eyed,\ntrying to assume a masterful air as he dismayed the tranquil old woman\nby demanding his child. A powerful scene followed; and Mrs Meg surprised\neven those who knew her best by the homely dignity with which she at\nfirst met the man she dreaded; then, as he brutally pressed his claim,\nshe pleaded with trembling voice and hands to keep the little creature\nshe had promised the dying mother to protect; and when he turned to\ntake it by force, quite a thrill went through the house as the old woman\nsprung to snatch it from the cradle, and holding it close, defied him in\nGod's name to tear it from that sacred refuge. It was really well done;\nand the round of applause that greeted the fine tableau of the indignant\nold woman, the rosy, blinking baby clinging to her neck, and the daunted\nman who dared not execute his evil purpose with such a defender for\nhelpless innocence, told the excited authors that their first scene was\na hit.\n\nThe second was quieter, and introduced Josie as a bonny country lass\nsetting the supper-table in a bad humour. The pettish way in which she\nslapped down the plates, hustled the cups, and cut the big brown loaf,\nas she related her girlish trials and ambitions, was capital. Mrs Jo\nkept her eye on Miss Cameron, and saw her nod approval several times at\nsome natural tone or gesture, some good bit of by-play or a quick change\nof expression in the young face, which was as variable as an April day.\nHer struggle with the toasting-fork made much merriment; so did her\ncontempt for the brown sugar, and the relish with which she sweetened\nher irksome duties by eating it; and when she sat, like Cinderella, on\nthe hearth, tearfully watching the flames dance on the homely room, a\ngirlish voice was heard to exclaim impulsively:\n\n'Poor little thing! she ought to have some fun!'\n\nThe old woman enters; and mother and daughter have a pretty scene, in\nwhich the latter coaxes and threatens, kisses and cries, till she wins\nthe reluctant consent of the former to visit a rich relation in the\ncity; and from being a little thunder-cloud Dolly becomes bewitchingly\ngay and good, as soon as her wilful wish is granted. The poor old soul\nhas hardly recovered from this trial when the son enters, in army\nblue, tells he has enlisted and must go. That is a hard blow; but the\npatriotic mother bears it well, and not till the thoughtless young folks\nhave hastened away to tell their good news elsewhere does she break\ndown. Then the country kitchen becomes pathetic as the old mother sits\nalone mourning over her children, till the grey head is hidden in the\nhands as she kneels down by the cradle to weep and pray, with only Baby\nto comfort her fond and faithful heart.\n\nSniffs were audible all through the latter part of this scene; and\nwhen the curtain fell, people were so busy wiping their eyes that for\na moment they forgot to applaud. That silent moment was more flattering\nthan noise; and as Mrs Jo wiped the real tears off her sister's\nface, she said as solemnly as an unconscious dab of rouge on her nose\npermitted:\n\n'Meg, you have saved my play! Oh, why aren't you a real actress, and I a\nreal playwright?'\n\n'Don't gush now, dear, but help me dress Josie; she's in such a quiver\nof excitement, I can't manage her, and this is her best scene, you\nknow.'\n\nSo it was; for her aunt had written it especially for her, and little Jo\nwas happy in a gorgeous dress, with a train long enough to satisfy her\nwildest dreams. The rich relation's parlour was in festival array, and\nthe country cousin sails in, looking back at her sweeping flounces with\nsuch artless rapture that no one had the heart to laugh at the pretty\njay in borrowed plumes. She has confidences with herself in the mirror,\nfrom which it is made evident that she had discovered all is not gold\nthat glitters, and has found greater temptations than those a girlish\nlove of pleasure, luxury, and flattery bring her. She is sought by a\nrich lover; but her honest heart resists the allurements he offers,\nand in its innocent perplexity wishes 'mother' was there to comfort and\ncounsel.\n\nA gay little dance, in which Dora, Nan, Bess, and several of the boys\ntook part, made a good background for the humble figure of the old woman\nin her widow's bonnet, rusty shawl, big umbrella, and basket. Her naive\nastonishment, as she surveys the spectacle, feels the curtains, and\nsmooths her old gloves during the moment she remains unseen, was very\ngood; but Josie's unaffected start when she sees her, and the cry:\n'Why, there's mother!' was such a hearty little bit of nature, it hardly\nneeded the impatient tripping over her train as she ran into the arms\nthat seemed now to be her nearest refuge.\n\nThe lover plays his part; and ripples of merriment greeted the old\nwoman's searching questions and blunt answers during the interview which\nshows the girl how shallow his love is, and how near she had been to\nruining her life as bitterly as poor 'Elizy' did. She gives her answer\nfrankly, and when they are alone, looks from her own bedizened self\nto the shabby dress, work-worn hands, and tender face, crying with a\nrepentant sob and kiss: 'Take me home, mother, and keep me safe. I've\nhad enough of this!'\n\n'That will do you good, Maria; don't forget it,' said one lady to her\ndaughter as the curtain went down; and the girl answered: 'Well, I'm\nsure I don't see why it's touching; but it is,' as she spread her lace\nhandkerchief to dry.\n\nTom and Nan came out strong in the next scene; for it was a ward in\nan army hospital, and surgeon and nurse went from bed to bed, feeling\npulses, administering doses, and hearing complaints with an energy and\ngravity which convulsed the audience. The tragic element, never far from\nthe comic at such times and places, came in when, while they bandaged\nan arm, the doctor told the nurse about an old woman who was searching\nthrough the hospital for her son, after days and nights on battlefields,\nthrough ambulances, and among scenes which would have killed most women.\n\n'She will be here directly, and I dread her coming, for I'm afraid the\npoor lad who has just gone is her boy. I'd rather face a cannon than\nthese brave women, with their hope and courage and great sorrow,' says\nthe surgeon.\n\n'Ah, these poor mothers break my heart!' adds the nurse, wiping her eyes\non her big apron; and with the words Mrs Meg came in.\n\nThere was the same dress, the basket and umbrella, the rustic speech,\nthe simple manners; but all were made pathetic by the terrible\nexperience which had changed the tranquil old woman to that haggard\nfigure with wild eyes, dusty feet, trembling hands, and an expression of\nmingled anguish, resolution, and despair which gave the homely figure\na tragic dignity and power that touched all hearts. A few broken words\ntold the story of her vain search, and then the sad quest began again.\nPeople held their breath as, led by the nurse, she went from bed to\nbed, showing in her face the alternations of hope, dread, and bitter\ndisappointment as each was passed. On a narrow cot was a long figure\ncovered with a sheet, and here she paused to lay one hand on her heart\nand one on her eyes, as if to gather courage to look at the nameless\ndead. Then she drew down the sheet, gave a long shivering sigh of\nrelief, saying softly:\n\n'Not my son, thank God! but some mother's boy.' And stooping down, she\nkissed the cold forehead tenderly.\n\nSomebody sobbed there, and Miss Cameron shook two tears out of her eyes,\nanxious to lose no look or gesture as the poor soul, nearly spent with\nthe long strain, struggled on down the long line. But her search was\nhappily ended for, as if her voice had roused him from his feverish\nsleep, a gaunt, wild-eyed man sat up in his bed, and stretching his arms\nto her, cried in a voice that echoed through the room:\n\n'Mother, mother! I knew you'd come to me!'\n\nShe did go to him, with a cry of love and joy that thrilled every\nlistener, as she gathered him in her arms with the tears and prayers and\nblessing such as only a fond and faithful old mother could give.\n\nThe last scene was a cheerful contrast to this; for the country kitchen\nwas bright with Christmas cheer, the wounded hero, with black patch and\ncrutches well displayed, sat by the fire in the old chair whose familiar\ncreak was soothing to his ear; pretty Dolly was stirring about, gaily\ntrimming dresser, settle, high chimney-piece, and old-fashioned cradle\nwith mistletoe and holly; while the mother rested beside her son, with\nthat blessed baby on her knee. Refreshed by a nap and nourishment, this\nyoung actor now covered himself with glory by his ecstatic prancings,\nincoherent remarks to the audience, and vain attempts to get to the\nfootlights, as he blinked approvingly at these brilliant toys. It was\ngood to see Mrs Meg pat him on the back, cuddle the fat legs out of\nsight, and appease his vain longings with a lump of sugar, till Baby\nembraced her with a grateful ardour that brought him a round of applause\nall for his little self.\n\nA sound of singing outside disturbs the happy family, and, after a carol\nin the snowy moonlight, a flock of neighbours troop in with Christmas\ngifts and greetings. Much by-play made this a lively picture; for Sam's\nsweetheart hovered round him with a tenderness the Marquise did not\nshow the Baron; and Dolly had a pretty bit under the mistletoe with her\nrustic adorer, who looked so like Ham Peggotty in his cowhide boots,\nrough jacket, and dark beard and wig, that no one would have recognized\nTed but for the long legs, which no extent of leather could disguise. It\nended with a homely feast, brought by the guests; and as they sat round\nthe table covered with doughnuts and cheese, pumpkin-pie, and other\ndelicacies, Sam rises on his crutches to propose the first toast, and\nholding up his mug of cider, says, with a salute, and a choke in his\nvoice: 'Mother, God bless her!' All drink it standing, Dolly with her\narm round the old woman's neck, as she hides her happy tears on her\ndaughter's breast; while the irrepressible baby beat rapturously on the\ntable with a spoon, and crowed audibly as the curtain went down.\n\nThey had it up again in a jiffy to get a last look at the group about\nthat central figure, which was showered with bouquets, to the great\ndelight of the infant Roscius; till a fat rosebud hit him on the nose,\nand produced the much-dreaded squall, which, fortunately, only added to\nthe fun at that moment.\n\n'Well, that will do for a beginning,' said Beaumont, with a sigh of\nrelief, as the curtain descended for the last time, and the actors\nscattered to dress for the closing piece.\n\n'As an experiment, it is a success. Now we can venture to begin our\ngreat American drama,' answered Mrs Jo, full of satisfaction and grand\nideas for the famous play--which, we may add, she did not write that\nyear, owing to various dramatic events in her own family.\n\nThe Owlsdark Marbles closed the entertainment, and, being something new,\nproved amusing to this very indulgent audience. The gods and goddesses\non Parnassus were displayed in full conclave; and, thanks to Mrs Amy's\nskill in draping and posing, the white wigs and cotton-flannel robes\nwere classically correct and graceful, though sundry modern additions\nsomewhat marred the effect, while adding point to the showman's learned\nremarks. Mr Laurie was Professor Owlsdark in cap and gown; and, after\na high-flown introduction, he proceeded to exhibit and explain his\nmarbles. The first figure was a stately Minerva; but a second glance\nproduced a laugh, for the words 'Women's Rights' adorned her shield, a\nscroll bearing the motto 'Vote early and often' hung from the beak of\nthe owl perched on her lance, and a tiny pestle and mortar ornamented\nher helmet. Attention was drawn to the firm mouth, the piercing eye, the\nawe-inspiring brow, of the strong-minded woman of antiquity, and some\nscathing remarks made upon the degeneracy of her modern sisters who\nfailed to do their duty. Mercury came next, and was very fine in his\nairy attitude, though the winged legs quivered as if it was difficult to\nkeep the lively god in his place. His restless nature was dilated upon,\nhis mischievous freaks alluded to, and a very bad character given to\nthe immortal messenger-boy; which delighted his friends and caused\nthe marble nose of the victim to curl visibly with scorn when derisive\napplause greeted a particularly hard hit. A charming little Hebe stood\nnext, pouring nectar from a silver teapot into a blue china tea-cup. She\nalso pointed a moral; for the Professor explained that the nectar of old\nwas the beverage which cheers but does not inebriate, and regretted that\nthe excessive devotion of American women to this classic brew proved so\nharmful, owing to the great development of brain their culture produced.\nA touch at modern servants, in contrast to this accomplished table-girl,\nmade the statue's cheeks glow under the chalk, and brought her a hearty\nround as the audience recognized Dolly and the smart soubrette.\n\nJove in all his majesty followed, as he and his wife occupied the\ncentral pedestals in the half-circle of immortals. A splendid Jupiter,\nwith hair well set up off the fine brow, ambrosial beard, silver\nthunderbolts in one hand, and a well-worn ferule in the other. A\nlarge stuffed eagle from the museum stood at his feet; and the benign\nexpression of his august countenance showed that he was in a good\nhumour--as well he might be, for he was paid some handsome compliments\nupon his wise rule, the peaceful state of his kingdom, and the brood\nof all-accomplished Pallases that yearly issued from his mighty brain.\nCheers greeted this and other pleasant words, and caused the thunderer\nto bow his thanks; for 'Jove nods', as everyone knows, and flattery wins\nthe heart of gods and men.\n\nMrs Juno, with her peacocks, darning-needle, pen, and cooking-spoon, did\nnot get off so easily; for the Professor was down on her with all manner\nof mirth-provoking accusations, criticisms, and insults even. He alluded\nto her domestic infelicity, her meddlesome disposition, sharp tongue,\nbad temper, and jealousy, closing, however, with a tribute to her\nskill in caring for the wounds and settling the quarrels of belligerent\nheroes, as well as her love for youths in Olympus and on earth. Gales of\nlaughter greeted these hits, varied by hisses from some indignant boys,\nwho would not bear, even in joke, any disrespect to dear Mother Bhaer,\nwho, however, enjoyed it all immensely, as the twinkle in her eye and\nthe irrepressible pucker of her lips betrayed.\n\nA jolly Bacchus astride of his cask took Vulcan's place, and appeared to\nbe very comfortable with a beer-mug in one hand, a champagne bottle in\nthe other, and a garland of grapes on his curly head. He was the text\nof a short temperance lecture, aimed directly at a row of smart young\ngentlemen who lined the walls of the auditorium. George Cole was seen\nto dodge behind a pillar at one point, Dolly nudged his neighbour at\nanother, and there was laughter all along the line as the Professor\nglared at them through his big glasses, and dragged their bacchanalian\norgies to the light and held them up to scorn.\n\nSeeing the execution he had done, the learned man turned to the lovely\nDiana, who stood as white and still as the plaster stag beside her, with\nsandals, bow, and crescent; quite perfect, and altogether the best piece\nof statuary in the show. She was very tenderly treated by the paternal\ncritic who, merely alluding to her confirmed spinsterhood, fondness for\nathletic sports, and oracular powers, gave a graceful little exposition\nof true art and passed on to the last figure.\n\nThis was Apollo in full fig, his curls skilfully arranged to hide a\nwell-whitened patch over the eye, his handsome legs correctly poised,\nand his gifted fingers about to draw divine music from the silvered\ngridiron which was his lyre. His divine attributes were described, as\nwell as his little follies and failings, among which were his weakness\nfor photography and flute-playing, his attempts to run a newspaper, and\nhis fondness for the society of the Muses; which latter slap produced\ngiggles and blushes among the girl-graduates, and much mirth among the\nstricken youths; for misery loves company, and after this they began to\nrally.\n\nThen, with a ridiculous conclusion, the Professor bowed his thanks;\nand after several recalls the curtain fell, but not quickly enough to\nconceal Mercury, wildly waving his liberated legs, Hebe dropping her\nteapot, Bacchus taking a lovely roll on his barrel, and Mrs Juno rapping\nthe impertinent Owlsdark on the head with Jove's ruler.\n\nWhile the audience filed out to supper in the hall, the stage was a\nscene of dire confusion as gods and goddesses, farmers and barons,\nmaids and carpenters, congratulated one another on the success of their\nlabours. Assuming various costumes, actors and actresses soon joined\ntheir guests, to sip bounteous draughts of praise with their coffee, and\ncool their modest blushes with ice-cream. Mrs Meg was a proud and happy\nwoman when Miss Cameron came to her as she sat by Josie, with Demi\nserving both, and said, so cordially that it was impossible to doubt the\nsincerity of her welcome words:\n\n'Mrs Brooke, I no longer wonder where your children get their talent.\nI make my compliments to the Baron and next summer you must let me have\nlittle \"Dolly\" as a pupil when we are at the beach.'\n\nOne can easily imagine how this offer was received, as well as the\nfriendly commendation bestowed by the same kind critic on the work of\nBeaumont and Fletcher, who hastened to explain that this trifle was only\nan attempt to make nature and art go hand in hand, with little help from\nfine writing or imposing scenery. Everybody was in the happiest mood,\nespecially 'little Dolly', who danced like a will-o'-the-wisp with\nlight-footed Mercury and Apollo as he promenaded with the Marquise on\nhis arm, who seemed to have left her coquetry in the green room with her\nrouge.\n\nWhen all was over, Mrs Juno said to Jove, to whose arm she clung as they\ntrudged home along the snowy paths: 'Fritz dear, Christmas is a good\ntime for new resolutions, and I've made one never to be impatient or\nfretful with my beloved husband again. I know I am, though you won't own\nit; but Laurie's fun had some truth in it, and I felt hit in a tender\nspot. Henceforth I am a model wife, else I don't deserve the dearest,\nbest man ever born'; and being in a dramatic mood, Mrs Juno tenderly\nembraced her excellent Jove in the moonlight, to the great amusement of\nsundry lingerers behind them.\n\nSo all three plays might be considered successes, and that merry\nChristmas night a memorable one in the March family; for Demi got an\nunspoken question answered, Josie's fondest wish was granted, and,\nthanks to Professor Owlsdark's jest, Mrs Jo made Professor Bhaer's busy\nlife quite a bed of roses by the keeping of her resolution. A few days\nlater she had her reward for this burst of virtue in Dan's letter, which\nset her fears at rest and made her very happy, though she was unable to\ntell him so, because he sent her no address.\n\n\n\nChapter 15. WAITING\n\n'My wife, I have bad news for thee,' said Professor Bhaer, coming in one\nday early in January.\n\n'Please tell it at once. I can't bear to wait, Fritz,' cried Mrs Jo,\ndropping her work and standing up as if to take the shot bravely.\n\n'But we must wait and hope, heart's-dearest. Come and let us bear it\ntogether. Emil's ship is lost, and as yet no news of him.'\n\nIt was well Mr Bhaer had taken his wife into his strong arms, for she\nlooked ready to drop, but bore up after a moment, and sitting by her\ngood man, heard all that there was to tell. Tidings had been sent to the\nshipowners at Hamburg by some of the survivors, and telegraphed at once\nby Franz to his uncle. As one boat-load was safe, there was hope that\nothers might also escape, though the gale had sent two to the bottom.\nA swift-sailing steamer had brought these scanty news, and happier ones\nmight come at any hour; but kind Franz had not added that the sailors\nreported the captain's boat as undoubtedly wrecked by the falling mast,\nsince the smoke hid its escape, and the gale soon drove all far asunder.\nBut this sad rumour reached Plumfield in time; and deep was the mourning\nfor the happyhearted Commodore, never to come singing home again. Mrs\nJo refused to believe it, stoutly insisting that Emil would outlive\nany storm and yet turn up safe and gay. It was well she clung to this\nhopeful view, for poor Mr Bhaer was much afflicted by the loss of his\nboy, because his sister's sons had been his so long he scarcely knew a\ndifferent love for his very own. Now was a chance for Mrs Juno to keep\nher word; and she did, speaking cheerily of Emil, even when hope waxed\nfaint and her heart was heavy. If anything could comfort the Bhaers for\nthe loss of one boy, it would have been the affection and sorrow shown\nby all the rest. Franz kept the cable busy with his varying messages,\nNat sent loving letters from Leipzig, and Tom harassed the shipping\nagents for news. Even busy Jack wrote them with unusual warmth; Dolly\nand George came often, bearing the loveliest flowers and the\ndaintiest bon-bons to cheer Mrs Bhaer and sweeten Josie's grief; while\ngood-hearted Ned travelled all the way from Chicago to press their hands\nand say, with a tear in his eye: 'I was so anxious to hear all about the\ndear old boy, I couldn't keep away.'\n\n'That's right comfortable, and shows me that if I didn't teach my boys\nanything else, I did give them the brotherly love that will make them\nstand by one another all their lives,' said Mrs Jo, when he had gone.\n\nRob answered reams of sympathizing letters, which showed how many\nfriends they had; and the kindly praises of the lost man would have\nmade Emil a hero and a saint, had they all been true. The elders bore\nit quietly, having learned submission in life's hard school; but the\nyounger people rebelled; some hoped against hope and kept up, others\ndespaired at once, and little Josie, Emil's pet cousin and playmate, was\nso broken-hearted nothing could comfort her. Nan dosed in vain, Daisy's\ncheerful words went by like the wind, and Bess's devices to amuse her\nall failed utterly. To cry in mother's arms and talk about the wreck,\nwhich haunted her even in her sleep, was all she cared to do; and Mrs\nMeg was getting anxious when Miss Cameron sent Josie a kind note bidding\nher learn bravely her first lesson in real tragedy, and be like the\nself-sacrificing heroines she loved to act. That did the little girl\ngood, and she made an effort in which Teddy and Octoo helped her much;\nfor the boy was deeply impressed by this sudden eclipse of the firefly\nwhose light and life all missed when they were gone, and lured her out\nevery day for long drives behind the black mare, who shook her silvery\nbells till they made such merry music Josie could not help listening to\nit, and whisked her over the snowy roads at a pace which set the blood\ndancing in her veins and sent her home strengthened and comforted by\nsunshine, fresh air, and congenial society--three aids young sufferers\nseldom can resist.\n\nAs Emil was helping nurse Captain Hardy, safe and well, aboard the ship,\nall this sorrow would seem wasted; but it was not, for it drew many\nhearts more closely together by a common grief, taught some patience,\nsome sympathy, some regret for faults that lie heavy on the conscience\nwhen the one sinned against is gone, and all of them the solemn lesson\nto be ready when the summons comes. A hush lay over Plumfield for weeks,\nand the studious faces on the hill reflected the sadness of those in the\nvalley. Sacred music sounded from Parnassus to comfort all who heard;\nthe brown cottage was beseiged with gifts for the little mourner, and\nEmil's flag hung at half-mast on the roof where he last sat with Mrs Jo.\n\nSo the weeks went heavily by till suddenly, like a thunderbolt out of a\nclear sky, came the news, 'All safe, letters on the way.' Then up went\nthe flag, out rang the college bells, bang went Teddy's long-unused\ncannon, and a chorus of happy voices cried 'Thank God', as people went\nabout, laughing, crying, and embracing one another in a rapture of\ndelight. By and by the longed-for letters came, and all the story of the\nwreck was told; briefly by Emil, eloquently by Mrs Hardy, gratefully by\nthe captain, while Mary added a few tender words that went straight to\ntheir hearts and seemed the sweetest of all. Never were letters so read,\npassed round, admired, and cried over as these; for Mrs Jo carried them\nin her pocket when Mr Bhaer did not have them in his, and both took a\nlook at them when they said their prayers at night. Now the Professor\nwas heard humming like a big bee again as he went to his classes, and\nthe lines smoothed out of Mother Bhaer's forehead, while she wrote this\nreal story to anxious friends and let her romances wait. Now messages\nof congratulation flowed in, and beaming faces showed everywhere. Rob\namazed his parents by producing a poem which was remarkably good for one\nof his years, and Demi set it to music that it might be sung when the\nsailor boy returned. Teddy stood on his head literally, and tore about\nthe neighbourhood on Octoo, like a second Paul Revere--only his tidings\nwere good. But best of all, little Josie lifted up her head as the\nsnowdrops did, and began to bloom again, growing tall and quiet, with\nthe shadow of past sorrow to tone down her former vivacity and show\nthat she had learned a lesson in trying to act well her part on the real\nstage, where all have to take their share in the great drama of life.\n\nNow another sort of waiting began; for the travellers were on their way\nto Hamburg, and would stay there awhile before coming home, as Uncle\nHermann owned the Brenda, and the captain must report to him. Emil must\nremain to Franz's wedding, deferred till now because of the season of\nmourning, so happily ended. These plans were doubly welcome and pleasant\nafter the troublous times which went before, and no spring ever seemed\nso beautiful as this one; for, as Teddy put it:\n\n    'Now is the winter of our discontent\n     Made glorious by these sons of Bhaer!'\n\nFranz and Emil being regarded in the light of elder brothers by the real\n'sons of Bhaer'.\n\nThere was great scrubbing and dusting among the matrons as they set\ntheir houses in order not only for Class Day, but to receive the bride\nand groom, who were to come to them for the honeymoon trip. Great plans\nwere made, gifts prepared, and much joy felt at the prospect of seeing\nFranz again; though Emil, who was to accompany them, would be the\ngreater hero. Little did the dear souls dream what a surprise was in\nstore for them, as they innocently laid their plans and wished all the\nboys could be there to welcome home their eldest and their Casablanca.\n\nWhile they wait and work so happily, let us see how our other absent\nboys are faring as they too wait and work and hope for better days. Nat\nwas toiling steadily along the path he had wisely chosen, though it was\nby no means strewn with flowers--quite thorny was it, in fact, and hard\nto travel, after the taste of ease and pleasure he had got when nibbling\nat forbidden fruit. But his crop of wild oats was a light one, and he\nresolutely reaped what he had sowed, finding some good wheat among\nthe tares. He taught by day; he fiddled night after night in the dingy\nlittle theatre, and he studied so diligently that his master was well\npleased, and kept him in mind as one to whom preferment was due, if any\nchance occurred. Gay friends forgot him; but the old ones stood fast,\nand cheered him up when Heimweh and weariness made him sad. As spring\ncame on things mended--expenses grew less, work pleasanter, and life\nmore bearable than when wintry storms beat on his thinly clad back, and\nfrost pinched the toes that patiently trudged in old boots. No debts\nburdened him; the year of absence was nearly over; and if he chose to\nstay, Herr Bergmann had hopes for him that would bring independence for\na time at least. So he walked under the lindens with a lighter heart,\nand in the May evenings went about the city with a band of strolling\nstudents, making music before houses where he used to sit as guest. No\none recognized him in the darkness, though old friends often listened\nto the band; and once Minna threw him money, which he humbly received as\npart of his penance, being morbid on the subject of his sins.\n\nHis reward came sooner than he expected, and was greater than he\ndeserved, he thought, though his heart leaped with joy when his master\none day informed him that he was chosen, with several other of his most\npromising pupils, to join the musical society which was to take part in\nthe great festival in London the next July. Here was not only honour for\nthe violinist but happiness for the man, as it brought him nearer home,\nand would open a chance of further promotion and profit in his chosen\nprofession.\n\n'Make thyself useful to Bachmeister there in London with thy English,\nand if all goes well with him, he will be glad to take thee to America,\nwhither he goes in the early autumn for winter concerts. Thou hast done\nwell these last months, and I have hopes of thee.'\n\nAs the great Bergmann seldom praised his pupils, these words filled\nNat's soul with pride and joy, and he worked yet more diligently than\nbefore to fulfil his master's prophecy. He thought the trip to England\nhappiness enough, but found room for more when, early in June, Franz\nand Emil paid him a flying visit, bringing all sorts of good news, kind\nwishes, and comfortable gifts for the lonely fellow, who could have\nfallen on their necks and cried like a girl at seeing his old mates\nagain. How glad he was to be found in his little room busy at his proper\nwork, not living like an idle gentleman on borrowed money! How proud\nhe was to tell his plans, assure them that he had no debts, and receive\ntheir praises for his improvement in music, their respect for his\neconomy and steadfastness in well-doing! How relieved when, having\nhonestly confessed his shortcomings, they only laughed, and owned that\nthey also had known like experiences, and were the wiser for them. He\nwas to go to the wedding late in June, and join his comrades in London.\nAs best man, he could not refuse the new suit Franz insisted on ordering\nfor him; and a cheque from home about that time made him feel like a\nmillionaire--and a happy one; for this was accompanied by such kind\nletters full of delight in his success, he felt that he had earned it,\nand waited for his joyful holiday with the impatience of a boy.\n\nDan meantime was also counting the weeks till August, when he would\nbe free. But neither marriage-bells nor festival music awaited him; no\nfriends would greet him as he left the prison; no hopeful prospect lay\nbefore him; no happy home-going was to be his. Yet his success was far\ngreater than Nat's, though only God and one good man saw it. It was\na hard-won battle; but he would never have to fight so terrible a\none again; for though enemies would still assail from within and from\nwithout, he had found the little guide-book that Christian carried in\nhis bosom, and Love, Penitence, and Prayer, the three sweet sisters, had\ngiven him the armour which would keep him safe. He had not learned to\nwear it yet, and chafed against it, though he felt its value, thanks to\nthe faithful friend who had stood by him all that bitter year.\n\nSoon he was to be free again, worn and scarred in the fray, but out\namong men in the blessed sun and air. When he thought of it Dan felt as\nif he could not wait, but must burst that narrow cell and fly away,\nas the caddis-worms he used to watch by the brookside shed their stony\ncoffins, to climb the ferns and soar into the sky. Night after night he\nlulled himself to sleep with planning how, when he had seen Mary Mason\naccording to his promise, he would steer straight for his old friends,\nthe Indians, and in the wilderness hide his disgrace and heal his\nwounds. Working to save the many would atone for the sin of killing\none, he thought; and the old free life would keep him safe from the\ntemptations that beset him in cities.\n\n'By and by, when I'm all right again, and have something to tell that\nI'm not ashamed of, I'll go home,' he said, with a quicker beat of the\nimpetuous heart that longed to be there so intensely, he found it as\nhard to curb as one of his unbroken horses on the plains. 'Not yet. I\nmust get over this first. They'd see and smell and feel the prison taint\non me, if I went now, and I couldn't look them in the face and hide\nthe truth. I can't lose Ted's love, Mother Bhaer's confidence, and the\nrespect of the girls, for they did respect my strength, anyway; but now\nthey wouldn't touch me.' And poor Dan looked with a shudder at the brown\nfist he clenched involuntarily as he remembered what it had done since\na certain little white hand had laid in it confidingly. 'I'll make 'em\nproud of me yet; and no one shall ever know of this awful year. I can\nwipe it out, and I will, so help me God!' And the clenched hand was held\nup as if to take a solemn oath that this lost year should yet be made\ngood, if resolution and repentance could work the miracle.\n\n\n\nChapter 16. IN THE TENNIS-COURT\n\nAthletic sports were in high favour at Plumfield; and the river where\nthe old punt used to wabble about with a cargo of small boys, or echo to\nthe shrill screams of little girls trying to get lilies, now was\nalive with boats of all kinds, from the slender wherry to the trim\npleasure-craft, gay with cushions, awnings, and fluttering pennons.\nEveryone rowed, and the girls as well as the youths had their races, and\ndeveloped their muscles in the most scientific manner. The large, level\nmeadow near the old willow was now the college playground, and here\nbaseball battles raged with fury, varied by football, leaping, and\nkindred sports fitted to split the fingers, break the ribs, and strain\nthe backs of the too ambitious participants. The gentler pastimes of the\ndamsels were at a safe distance from this Champ de Mars; croquet mallets\nclicked under the elms that fringed the field, rackets rose and fell\nenergetically in several tennis-courts, and gates of different heights\nwere handy to practise the graceful bound by which every girl expected\nto save her life some day when the mad bull, which was always coming but\nnever seemed to arrive, should be bellowing at her heels.\n\nOne of these tennis grounds was called 'Jo's Court', and here the little\nlady ruled like a queen; for she was fond of the game, and being bent on\ndeveloping her small self to the highest degree of perfection, she was\nto be found at every leisure moment with some victim hard at it. On a\ncertain pleasant Saturday afternoon she had been playing with Bess and\nbeating her; for, though more graceful, the Princess was less active\nthan her cousin, and cultivated her roses by quieter methods.\n\n'Oh dear! you are tired, and every blessed boy is at that stupid\nbaseball match. 'What shall I do?' sighed Josie, pushing back the great\nred hat she wore, and gazing sadly round her for more worlds to conquer.\n\n'I'll play presently, when I'm a little cooler. But it is dull work for\nme, as I never win,' answered Bess, fanning herself with a large leaf.\n\nJosie was about to sit down beside her on the rustic seat and wait, when\nher quick eye saw afar off two manly forms arrayed in white flannel;\ntheir blue legs seemed bearing them towards the battle going on in the\ndistance; but they never reached the fray; for with a cry of joy,\nJo raced away to meet them, bent on securing this heaven-sent\nreinforcement. Both paused as she came flying up, and both raised their\nhats; but oh, the difference there was in the salutes! The stout youth\npulled his off lazily and put it on again at once, as if glad to get the\nduty over; the slender being, with the crimson tie, lifted his with a\ngraceful bend, and held it aloft while he accosted the rosy, breathless\nmaid, thus permitting her to see his raven locks smoothly parted, with\none little curl upon the brow. Dolly prided himself upon that bow, and\npractised it before his glass, but did not bestow it upon all alike,\nregarding it as a work of art, fit only for the fairest and most\nfavoured of his female admirers; for he was a pretty youth, and fancied\nhimself an Adonis.\n\nEager Josie evidently did not appreciate the honour he did her, for with\na nod she begged them both to 'come along and play tennis, not go and\nget all hot and dirty with the boys'. These two adjectives won the day;\nfor Stuffy was already warmer than he liked to be, and Dolly had on\na new suit which he desired to keep immaculate as long as possible,\nconscious that it was very becoming.\n\n'Charmed to oblige,' answered the polite one, with another bend.\n\n'You play, I'll rest,' added the fat boy, yearning for repose and gentle\nconverse with the Princess in the cooling shade.\n\n'Well, you can comfort Bess, for I've beaten her all to bits and she\nneeds amusing. I know you've got something nice in your pocket, George;\ngive her some, and 'Dolphus can have her racket. Now then, fly round';\nand driving her prey before her, Josie returned in triumph to the court.\n\nCasting himself ponderously upon the bench, which creaked under his\nweight, Stuffy--as we will continue to call him, though no one\nelse dared to use the old name now--promptly produced the box of\nconfectionery, without which he never travelled far, and regaled Bess\nwith candied violets and other dainties, while Dolly worked hard to hold\nhis own against a most accomplished antagonist. He would have beaten her\nif an unlucky stumble, which produced an unsightly stain upon the knee\nof those new shorts, had not distracted his mind and made him careless.\nMuch elated at her victory, Josie permitted him to rest, and offered\nironical consolation for the mishap which evidently weighed upon his\nmind.\n\n'Don't be an old Betty; it can be cleaned. You must have been a cat\nin some former state, you are so troubled about dirt; or a tailor, and\nlived for clothes.'\n\n'Come now, don't hit a fellow when he is down,' responded Dolly from\nthe grass where he and Stuffy now lay to make room for both girls on the\nseat. One handkerchief was spread under him, and his elbow leaned upon\nanother, while his eyes were sadly fixed upon the green and brown spot\nwhich afflicted him. 'I like to be neat; don't think it civil to cut\nabout in old shoes and grey flannel shirts before ladies. Our fellows\nare gentlemen, and dress as such,' he added, rather nettled at the\nword 'tailor'; for he owed one of those too attractive persons an\nuncomfortably big bill.\n\n'So are ours; but good clothes alone don't make a gentleman here. We\nrequire a good deal more,' flashed Josie, in arms at once to defend\nher college. 'You will hear of some of the men in \"old boots and grey\nflannel\" when you and your fine gentlemen are twiddling your ties and\nscenting your hair in obscurity. I like old boots and wear them, and I\nhate dandies; don't you, Bess?'\n\n'Not when they are kind to me, and belong to our old set,' answered\nBess, with a nod of thanks to Dolly, who was carefully removing an\ninquisitive caterpillar from one of her little russet shoes.\n\n'I like a lady who is always polite, and doesn't snap a man's head off\nif he has a mind of his own; don't you, George?' asked Dolly, with his\nbest smile for Bess and a Harvard stare of disapprobation for Josie.\n\nA tranquil snore was Stuffy's sole reply, and a general laugh restored\npeace for the moment. But Josie loved to harass the lords of creation\nwho asserted themselves too much, and bided her time for another attack\ntill she had secured more tennis. She got another game; for Dolly was\na sworn knight of dames, so he obeyed her call, leaving Bess to sketch\nGeorge as he lay upon his back, his stout legs crossed, and his round\nred face partially eclipsed by his hat. Josie got beaten this time and\ncame back rather cross, so she woke the peaceful sleeper by tickling his\nnose with a straw till he sneezed himself into a sitting posture, and\nlooked wrathfully about for 'that confounded fly'.\n\n'Come, sit up and let us have a little elegant conversation; you\n\"howling swells\" ought to improve our minds and manners, for we are\nonly poor \"country girls in dowdy gowns and hats\",' began the gad-fly,\nopening the battle with a sly quotation from one of Dolly's unfortunate\nspeeches about certain studious damsels who cared more for books than\nfinery.\n\n'I didn't mean you! Your gowns are all right, and those hats the latest\nthing out,' began poor 'Dolphus, convicting himself by the incautious\nexclamation.\n\n'Caught you that time; I thought you fellows were all gentlemen, civil\nas well as nice. But you are always sneering at girls who don't dress\nwell and that is a very unmanly thing to do; my mother said so'; and\nJosie felt that she had dealt a shrewd blow at the elegant youth who\nbowed at many shrines if they were well-decorated ones.\n\n'Got you there, old boy, and she's right. You never hear me talk about\nclothes and such twaddle,' said Stuffy, suppressing a yawn, and feeling\nfor another bon-bon wherewith to refresh himself.\n\n'You talk about eating, and that is even worse for a man. You will marry\na cook and keep a restaurant some day,' laughed Josie, down on him at\nonce.\n\nThis fearful prediction kept him silent for several moments; but Dolly\nrallied, and wisely changing the subject, carried war into the enemy's\ncamp.\n\n'As you wanted us to improve your manners, allow me to say that young\nladies in good society don't make personal remarks or deliver lectures.\nLittle girls who are not out do it, and think it witty; but I assure you\nit's not good form.'\n\nJosie paused a moment to recover from the shock of being called 'a\nlittle girl', when all the honours of her fourteenth birthday were fresh\nupon her; and Bess said, in the lofty tone which was infinitely more\ncrushing than Jo's impertinence:\n\n'That is true; but we have lived all our lives with superior people, so\nwe have no society talk like your young ladies. We are so accustomed to\nsensible conversation, and helping one another by telling our faults,\nthat we have no gossip to offer you.'\n\nWhen the Princess reproved, the boys seldom resented it; so Dolly held\nhis peace, and Josie burst out, following her cousin's lead, which she\nthought a happy one:\n\n'Our boys like to have us talk with them, and take kindly any hints we\ngive. They don't think they know everything and are quite perfect at\neighteen, as I've observed the Harvard men do, especially the very young\nones.'\n\nJosie took immense satisfaction in that return shot; and Dolly showed\nthat he was hit, by the nettled tone in which he answered, with a\nsupercilious glance at the hot, dusty, and noisy crowd on the baseball\nground: 'The class of fellows you have here need all the polish and\nculture you can give them; and I'm glad they get it. Our men are largely\nfrom the best families all over the country, so we don't need girls to\nteach us anything.'\n\n'It's a pity you don't have more of such \"fellows\" as ours. They value\nand use well what college gives them, and aren't satisfied to slip\nthrough, getting all the fun they can and shirking the work. Oh, I've\nheard you \"men\" talk, and heard your fathers say they wish they hadn't\nwasted time and money just that you might say you'd been through\ncollege. As for the girls, you'll be much better off in all ways when\nthey do get in, and keep you lazy things up to the mark, as we do here.'\n\n'If you have such a poor opinion of us, why do you wear our colour?'\nasked Dolly, painfully conscious that he was not improving the\nadvantages his Alma Mater offered him, but bound to defend her.\n\n'I don't; my hat is scarlet, not crimson. Much you know about a colour,'\nscoffed Josie.\n\n'I know that a cross cow would soon set you scampering, if you flaunted\nthat red tile under her nose,' retorted Dolly.\n\n'I'm ready for her. Can your fine young ladies do this? or you either?'\nand burning to display her latest accomplishment, Josie ran to the\nnearest gate, put one hand on the top rail, and vaulted over as lightly\nas a bird.\n\nBess shook her head, and Stuffy languidly applauded; but Dolly scorning\nto be braved by a girl, took a flying leap and landed on his feet beside\nJosie, saying calmly: 'Can you do that?'\n\n'Not yet; but I will by and by.'\n\nAs his foe looked a little crestfallen, Dolly relented, and affably\nadded sundry feats of a like nature, quite unconscious that he had\nfallen into a dreadful snare; for the dull red paint on the gate, not\nbeing used to such vigorous handling, came off in streaks upon his\nshoulders when he turned a backward swing and came up smiling, to be\nrewarded with the aggravating remark:\n\n'If you want to know what crimson is, look at your back; it's nicely\nstamped on and won't wash out, I think.'\n\n'The deuce it won't!' cried Dolly, trying to get an impossible view, and\ngiving it up in great disgust.\n\n'I guess we'd better be going, Dolf,' said peaceable Stuffy, feeling\nthat it would be wise to retreat before another skirmish took place, as\nhis side seemed to be getting the worst of it.\n\n'Don't hurry, I beg; stay and rest; you must need it after the\ntremendous amount of brain work you've done this week. It is time for\nour Greek. Come, Bess. Good afternoon, gentlemen.' And, with a sweeping\ncourtesy, Josie led the way, with her hat belligerently cocked up, and\nher racket borne like a triumphal banner over one shoulder; for having\nhad the last word, she felt that she could retire with the honours of\nwar.\n\nDolly gave Bess his best bow, with the chill on; and Stuffy subsided\nluxuriously, with his legs in the air, murmuring in a dreamy tone:\n\n'Little Jo is as cross as two sticks today. I'm going in for another\nnap: too hot to play anything.'\n\n'So it is. Wonder if Spitfire was right about these beastly spots?'\nAnd Dolly sat down to try dry cleansing with one of his handkerchiefs.\n'Asleep?' he asked, after a few moments of this cheerful occupation,\nfearing that his chum might be too comfortable when he was in a fume\nhimself.\n\n'No. I was thinking that Jo wasn't far wrong about shirking. 'Tis a\nshame to get so little done, when we ought to be grinding like Morton\nand Torry and that lot. I never wanted to go to college; but my governor\nmade me. Much good it will do either of us!' answered Stuffy, with a\ngroan; for he hated work, and saw two more long years of it before him.\n\n'Gives a man prestige, you know. No need to dig. I mean to have a gay\nold time, and be a \"howling swell\", if I choose. Between you and me\nthough, it would be no end jolly to have the girls along. Study be\nhanged! But if we've got to turn the grindstone, it would be mighty nice\nto have some of the little dears to lend a hand. Wouldn't it now?'\n\n'I'd like three this minute--one to fan me, one to kiss me, and one\nto give me some iced lemonade!' sighed Stuffy, with a yearning glance\ntowards the house, whence no succour appeared.\n\n'How would root-beer do?' asked a voice behind them, which made Dolly\nspring to his feet and Stuffy roll over like a startled porpoise.\n\nSitting on the stile that crossed the wall near by was Mrs Jo, with two\njugs slung over her shoulder by a strap, several tin mugs in her hand,\nand an old-fashioned sun-bonnet on her head.\n\n'I knew the boys would be killing themselves with ice-water; so I\nstrolled down with some of my good, wholesome beer. They drank like\nfishes. But Silas was with me; so my cruse still holds out. Have some?'\n\n'Yes, thanks, very much. Let us pour it.' And Dolly held the cup while\nStuffy joyfully filled it; both very grateful, but rather afraid she had\nheard what went before the wish she fulfilled.\n\nShe proved that she had by saying, as they stood drinking her health,\nwhile she sat between them, looking like a middle-aged vivandiere, with\nher jugs and mugs:\n\n'I was glad to hear you say you would like to have girls at your\ncollege; but I hope you will learn to speak more respectfully of them\nbefore they come; for that will be the first lesson they will teach\nyou.'\n\n'Really, ma'am, I was only joking,' began Stuffy, gulping down his beer\nin a hurry.\n\n'So was I. I'm sure I--I'm devoted to 'em,' stuttered Dolly,\npanic-stricken; for he saw that he was in for a lecture of some sort.\n\n'Not in the right way. Frivolous girls may like to be called \"little\ndears\" and things of that sort; but the girls who love study wish to be\ntreated like reasonable beings, not dolls to flirt with. Yes, I'm going\nto preach; that's my business; so stand up and take it like men.'\n\nMrs Jo laughed; but she was in earnest; for by various hints and signs\nduring the past winter she knew that the boys were beginning to 'see\nlife' in the way she especially disapproved. Both were far from home,\nhad money enough to waste, and were as inexperienced, curious, and\ncredulous as most lads of their age. Not fond of books, therefore\nwithout the safeguard which keeps many studious fellows out of harm; one\nself-indulgent, indolent, and so used to luxury that pampering of the\nsenses was an easy thing; the other vain, as all comely boys are, full\nof conceit, and so eager to find favour in the eyes of his comrades\nthat he was ready for anything which would secure it. These traits and\nfoibles made both peculiarly liable to the temptations which assail\npleasure-loving and weak-willed boys. Mrs Jo knew them well, and had\ndropped many a warning word since they went to college; but till lately\nthey seemed not to understand some of her friendly hints; now she was\nsure they would, and meant to speak out: for long experience with boys\nmade her both bold and skilful in handling some of the dangers usually\nleft to silence, till it is too late for anything but pity and reproach.\n\n'I'm going to talk to you like a mother, because yours are far away; and\nthere are things that mothers can manage best, if they do their duty,'\nshe solemnly began from the depths of the sunbonnet.\n\n'Great Scott! We're in for it now!' thought Dolly, in secret dismay;\nwhile Stuffy got the first blow by trying to sustain himself with\nanother mug of beer.\n\n'That won't hurt you; but I must warn you about drinking other things,\nGeorge. Overeating is an old story; and a few more fits of illness will\nteach you to be wise. But drinking is a more serious thing, and leads\nto worse harm than any that can afflict your body alone. I hear you\ntalk about wines as if you knew them and cared more for them than a\nboy should; and several times I've heard jokes that meant mischief. For\nheaven's sake, don't begin to play with this dangerous taste \"for fun\",\nas you say, or because it's the fashion, and the other fellows do. Stop\nat once, and learn that temperance in all things is the only safe rule.'\n\n'Upon my honour, I only take wine and iron. I need a tonic, mother\nsays, to repair the waste of brain-tissue while I'm studying,' protested\nStuffy, putting down the mug as if it burnt his fingers.\n\n'Good beef and oatmeal will repair your tissues much better than any\ntonic of that sort. Work and plain fare are what you want; and I wish\nI had you here for a few months out of harm's way. I'd Banting you, and\nfit you to run without puffing, and get on without four or five meals a\nday. What an absurd hand that is for a man! You ought to be ashamed\nof it!' And Mrs Jo caught up the plump fist, with deep dimples at each\nknuckle, which was fumbling distressfully at the buckle of the belt girt\nabout a waist far too large for a youth of his age.\n\n'I can't help it--we all grow fat; it's in the family,' said Stuffy in\nself-defence.\n\n'All the more reason you should live carefully. Do you want to die\nearly, or be an invalid all your life?'\n\n'No, ma'am!'\n\nStuffy looked so scared that Mrs Jo could not be hard upon his budding\nsins, for they lay at his overindulgent mother's door line in a great\nmeasure; so she softened the tone of her voice, and added, with a little\nslap on the fat hand, as she used to do when it was small enough to\npilfer lumps of sugar from her bowl:\n\n'Then be careful; for a man writes his character in his face; and you\ndon't want gluttony and intemperance in yours, I know.'\n\n'I'm sure I don't! Please make out a wholesome bill of fare, and I'll\nstick to it, if I can. I am getting stout, and I don't like it; and my\nliver's torpid, and I have palpitations and headache. Overwork, mother\nsays; but it may be overeating.' And Stuffy gave a sigh of mingled\nregret for the good things he renounced, and relief as he finished\nloosening his belt as soon as his hand was free.\n\n'I will; follow it, and in a year you'll be a man and not a meal-bag.\nNow, Dolly'; and Mrs Jo turned to the other culprit, who shook in his\nshoes and wished he hadn't come.\n\n'Are you studying French as industriously as you were last winter?'\n\n'No ma'am; I don't care for it--that is, I, I'm busy with G-Greek just\nnow,' answered Dolly, beginning bravely, quite in the dark as to what\nthat odd question meant till a sudden memory made him stutter and look\nat his shoes with deep interest.\n\n'Oh, he doesn't study it; only reads French novels and goes to the\ntheatre when the opera bouffe is here,' said Stuffy, innocently\nconfirming Mrs Jo's suspicions.\n\n'So I understood; and that is what I want to speak about. Ted had a\nsudden desire to learn French in that way, from something you said,\nDolly; so I went myself, and was quite satisfied that it was no place\nfor a decent boy. Your men were out in full force; and I was glad to\nsee that some of the younger ones looked as ashamed as I felt. The older\nfellows enjoyed it, and when we came out were waiting to take those\npainted girls to supper. Did you ever go with them?'\n\n'Once.'\n\n'Did you like it?'\n\n'No 'm; I--I came away early,' stammered Dolly, with a face as red as\nhis splendid tie.\n\n'I'm glad you have not lost the grace of blushing yet; but you will\nsoon, if you keep up this sort of study and forget to be ashamed. The\nsociety of such women will unfit you for that of good ones, and lead you\ninto trouble and sin and shame. Oh, why don't the city fathers stop that\nevil thing, when they know the harm it does? It made my heart ache to\nsee those boys, who ought to be at home and in their beds, going off for\na night of riot which would help to ruin some of them for ever.'\n\nThe youths looked scared at Mrs Jo's energetic protest against one of\nthe fashionable pleasures of the day, and waited in conscience-stricken\nsilence--Stuffy glad that he never went to those gay suppers, and\nDolly deeply grateful that he 'came away early'. With a hand on either\nshoulder, and all the terrors smoothed from her brow, Mrs Jo went on\nin her most motherly tone, anxious to do for them what no other woman\nwould, and do it kindly:\n\n'My dear boys, if I didn't love you, I would not say these things. I\nknow they are not pleasant; but my conscience won't let me hold my peace\nwhen a word may keep you from two of the great sins that curse the world\nand send so many young men to destruction. You are just beginning to\nfeel the allurement of them, and soon it will be hard to turn away. Stop\nnow, I beg of you, and not only save yourselves but help others by\na brave example. Come to me if things worry you; don't be afraid or\nashamed; I have heard many sadder confessions than any you are ever\nlikely to bring me, and been able to comfort many poor fellows, gone\nwrong for want of a word in time. Do this, and you will be able to\nkiss your mothers with clean lips, and by and by have the right to ask\ninnocent girls to love you.'\n\n'Yes'm, thank you. I suppose you're right; but it's pretty hard work\nto toe the mark when ladies give you wine and gentlemen take their\ndaughters to see Aimee,' said Dolly, foreseeing tribulations ahead\nthough he knew it was time to 'pull up'.\n\n'So it is; but all the more honour to those who are brave and wise\nenough to resist public opinion, and the easy-going morals of bad or\ncareless men and women. Think of the persons whom you respect most, and\nin imitating them you will secure the respect of those who look up to\nyou. I'd rather my boys should be laughed at and cold-shouldered by a\nhundred foolish fellows than lose what, once gone, no power can give\nthem back--innocence and self-respect. I don't wonder you find it\n\"hard to toe the mark\", when books, pictures, ball-rooms, theatres, and\nstreets offer temptations; yet you can resist, if you try. Last winter\nMrs Brooke used to worry about John's being out so late reporting; but\nwhen she spoke to him about the things he must see and hear on his way\nto and fro from the office at midnight, he said in his sober way, \"I\nknow what you mean, mother; but no fellow need to go wrong unless he\nwants to.\"\n\n'That's like the Deacon!' exclaimed Stuffy, with an approving smile on\nhis fat face.\n\n'I'm glad you told me that. He's right; and it's because he doesn't want\nto go wrong we all respect him so,' added Dolly, looking up now with\nan expression which assured his Mentor that the right string had been\ntouched, and a spirit of emulation roused, more helpful, perhaps, than\nany words of hers. Seeing this, she was satisfied, and said, as she\nprepared to leave the bar before which her culprits had been tried and\nfound guilty, but recommended to mercy:\n\n'Then be to others what John is to you--a good example. Forgive me for\ntroubling you, my dear lads, and remember my little preachment. I think\nit will do you good, though I may never know it. Chance words spoken\nin kindness often help amazingly; and that's what old people are here\nfor--else their experience is of little use. Now, come and find the\nyoung folk. I hope I shall never have to shut the gates of Plumfield\nupon you, as I have on some of your \"gentlemen\". I mean to keep my\nboys and girls safe if I can, and this a wholesome place where the good\nold-fashioned virtues are lived and taught.'\n\nMuch impressed by that dire threat, Dolly helped her from her perch with\ndeep respect; and Stuffy relieved her of her empty jugs, solemnly vowing\nto abstain from all fermented beverages except root-beer, as long\nas feeble flesh could hold out. Of course they made light of 'Mother\nBhaer's lecture' when they were alone--that was to be expected of 'men\nof our class' but in their secret souls they thanked her for giving\ntheir boyish consciences a jog, and more than once afterward had cause\nto remember gratefully that half-hour in the tennis court.\n\n\n\nChapter 17. AMONG THE MAIDS\n\nAlthough this story is about Jo's boys, her girls cannot be neglected,\nbecause they held a high place in this little republic, and especial\ncare was taken to fit them to play their parts worthily in the great\nrepublic which offered them wider opportunities and more serious duties.\nTo many the social influence was the better part of the training\nthey received; for education is not confined to books, and the finest\ncharacters often graduate from no college, but make experience their\nmaster, and life their book. Others cared only for the mental culture,\nand were in danger of over-studying, under the delusion which pervades\nNew England that learning must be had at all costs, forgetting that\nhealth and real wisdom are better. A third class of ambitious girls\nhardly knew what they wanted, but were hungry for whatever could fit\nthem to face the world and earn a living, being driven by necessity,\nthe urgency of some half-conscious talent, or the restlessness of\nstrong young natures to break away from the narrow life which no longer\nsatisfied.\n\nAt Plumfield all found something to help them; for the growing\ninstitution had not yet made its rules as fixed as the laws of the\nMedes and Persians, and believed so heartily in the right of all\nsexes, colours, creeds, and ranks to education, that there was room\nfor everyone who knocked, and a welcome to the shabby youths from up\ncountry, the eager girls from the West, the awkward freedman or woman\nfrom the South, or the well-born student whose poverty made this college\na possibility when other doors were barred. There still was prejudice,\nridicule, neglect in high places, and prophecies of failure to contend\nagainst; but the Faculty was composed of cheerful, hopeful men and women\nwho had seen greater reforms spring from smaller roots, and after stormy\nseasons blossom beautifully, to add prosperity and honour to the nation.\nSo they worked on steadily and bided their time, full of increasing\nfaith in their attempt as year after year their numbers grew, their\nplans succeeded, and the sense of usefulness in this most vital of all\nprofessions blessed them with its sweet rewards.\n\nAmong the various customs which had very naturally sprung up was one\nespecially useful and interesting to 'the girls', as the young women\nliked to be called. It all grew out of the old sewing hour still kept up\nby the three sisters long after the little work-boxes had expanded into\nbig baskets full of household mending. They were busy women, yet on\nSaturdays they tried to meet in one of the three sewing-rooms; for\neven classic Parnassus had its nook where Mrs Amy often sat among her\nservants, teaching them to make and mend, thereby giving them a respect\nfor economy, since the rich lady did not scorn to darn her hose, and sew\non buttons. In these household retreats, with books and work, and their\ndaughters by them, they read and sewed and talked in the sweet privacy\nthat domestic women love, and can make so helpful by a wise mixture of\ncooks and chemistry, table linen and theology, prosaic duties and good\npoetry.\n\nMrs Meg was the first to propose enlarging this little circle; for as\nshe went her motherly rounds among the young women she found a sad lack\nof order, skill, and industry in this branch of education. Latin, Greek,\nthe higher mathematics, and science of all sorts prospered finely; but\nthe dust gathered on the work-baskets, frayed elbows went unheeded, and\nsome of the blue stockings sadly needed mending. Anxious lest the usual\nsneer at learned women should apply to 'our girls', she gently lured two\nor three of the most untidy to her house, and made the hour so pleasant,\nthe lesson so kindly, that they took the hint, were grateful for the\nfavour, and asked to come again. Others soon begged to make the detested\nweekly duty lighter by joining the party, and soon it was a privilege\nso much desired that the old museum was refitted with sewing-machines,\ntables, rocking-chair, and a cheerful fireplace, so that, rain or shine,\nthe needles might go on undisturbed.\n\nHere Mrs Meg was in her glory, and stood wielding her big shears like a\nqueen as she cut out white work, fitted dresses, and directed Daisy, her\nspecial aide, about the trimming of hats, and completing the lace and\nribbon trifles which add grace to the simplest costume and save poor\nor busy girls so much money and time. Mrs Amy contributed taste, and\ndecided the great question of colours and complexions; for few women,\neven the most learned, are without that desire to look well which makes\nmany a plain face comely, as well as many a pretty one ugly for want of\nskill and knowledge of the fitness of things. She also took her turn to\nprovide books for the readings, and as art was her forte she gave them\nselections from Ruskin, Hamerton, and Mrs Jameson, who is never old.\nBess read these aloud as her contribution, and Josie took her turn at\nthe romances, poetry, and plays her uncles recommended. Mrs Jo gave\nlittle lectures on health, religion, politics, and the various questions\nin which all should be interested, with copious extracts from Miss\nCobbe's Duties of Women, Miss Brackett's Education of American Girls,\nMrs Duffy's No Sex in Education, Mrs Woolson's Dress Reform, and many of\nthe other excellent books wise women write for their sisters, now that\nthey are waking up and asking: 'What shall we do?'\n\nIt was curious to see the prejudices melt away as ignorance was\nenlightened, indifference change to interest, and intelligent minds\nset thinking, while quick wits and lively tongues added spice to the\ndiscussions which inevitably followed. So the feet that wore the neatly\nmended hose carried wiser heads than before, the pretty gowns covered\nhearts warmed with higher purposes, and the hands that dropped the\nthimbles for pens, lexicons, and celestial globes, were better fitted\nfor life's work, whether to rock cradles, tend the sick, or help on the\ngreat work of the world.\n\nOne day a brisk discussion arose concerning careers for women. Mrs Jo\nhad read something on the subject and asked each of the dozen girls\nsitting about the room, what she intended to do on leaving college.\nThe answers were as usual: 'I shall teach, help mother, study medicine,\nart,' etc.; but nearly all ended with:\n\n'Till I marry.'\n\n'But if you don't marry, what then?' asked Mrs Jo, feeling like a girl\nagain as she listened to the answers, and watched the thoughtful, gay,\nor eager faces.\n\n'Be old maids, I suppose. Horrid, but inevitable, since there are so\nmany superfluous women,' answered a lively lass, too pretty to fear\nsingle blessedness unless she chose it.\n\n'It is well to consider that fact, and fit yourselves to be useful, not\nsuperfluous women. That class, by the way, is largely made up of widows,\nI find; so don't consider it a slur on maidenhood.'\n\n'That's a comfort! Old maids aren't sneered at half as much as they used\nto be, since some of them have grown famous and proved that woman isn't\na half but a whole human being, and can stand alone.'\n\n'Don't like it all the same. We can't all be like Miss Nightingale, Miss\nPhelps, and the rest.'\n\nSo what can we do but sit in a corner and look on?' asked a plain girl\nwith a dissatisfied expression.\n\n'Cultivate cheerfulness and content, if nothing else. But there are so\nmany little odd jobs waiting to be done that nobody need \"sit idle and\nlook on\", unless she chooses,' said Mrs Meg, with a smile, laying on the\ngirl's head the new hat she had just trimmed.\n\n'Thank you very much. Yes, Mrs Brooke, I see; it's a little job, but\nit makes me neat and happy--and grateful,' she added, looking up with\nbrighter eyes as she accepted the labour of love and the lesson as\nsweetly as they were given.\n\n'One of the best and most beloved women I know has been doing odd jobs\nfor the Lord for years, and will keep at it till her dear hands are\nfolded in her coffin. All sorts of things she does--picks up neglected\nchildren and puts them in safe homes, saves lost girls, nurses poor\nwomen in trouble, sews, knits, trots, begs, works for the poor day after\nday with no reward but the thanks of the needy, the love and honour\nof the rich who make Saint Matilda their almoner. That's a life worth\nliving; and I think that quiet little woman will get a higher seat in\nHeaven than many of those of whom the world has heard.'\n\n'I know it's lovely, Mrs Bhaer; but it's dull for young folks. We do\nwant a little fun before we buckle to,' said a Western girl with a\nwide-awake face.\n\n'Have your fun, my dear; but if you must earn your bread, try to make it\nsweet with cheerfulness, not bitter with the daily regret that it isn't\ncake. I used to think mine was a very hard fate because I had to amuse\na somewhat fretful old lady; but the books I read in that lonely library\nhave been of immense use to me since, and the dear old soul bequeathed\nme Plumfield for my \"cheerful service and affectionate care\". I didn't\ndeserve it, but I did use to try to be jolly and kind, and get as\nmuch honey out of duty as I could, thanks to my dear mother's help and\nadvice.'\n\n'Gracious! if I could earn a place like this, I'd sing all day and be an\nangel; but you have to take your chance, and get nothing for your pains,\nperhaps. I never do,' said the Westerner, who had a hard time with small\nmeans and large aspirations.\n\n'Don't do it for the reward; but be sure it will come, though not in the\nshape you expect. I worked hard for fame and money one winter; but I\ngot neither, and was much disappointed. A year afterwards I found I had\nearned two prizes: skill with my pen, and Professor Bhaer.'\n\nMrs Jo's laugh was echoed blithely by the girls, who liked to have these\nconversations enlivened by illustrations from life.\n\n'You are a very lucky woman,' began the discontented damsel, whose soul\nsoared above new hats, welcome as they were, but did not quite know\nwhere to steer.\n\n'Yet her name used to be \"Luckless Jo\", and she never had what she\nwanted till she had given up hoping for it,' said Mrs Meg.\n\n'I'll give up hoping, then, right away, and see if my wishes will come.\nI only want to help my folks, and get a good school.'\n\n'Take this proverb for your guide: \"Get the distaff ready, and the Lord\nwill send the flax\",' answered Mrs Jo.\n\n'We'd better all do that, if we are to be spinsters,' said the pretty\none, adding gaily, 'I think I should like it, on the whole--they are so\nindependent. My Aunt Jenny can do just what she likes, and ask no one's\nleave; but Ma has to consult Pa about everything. Yes, I'll give you my\nchance, Sally, and be a \"superfluum\", as Mr Plock says.'\n\n'You'll be one of the first to go into bondage, see if you aren't. Much\nobliged, all the same.'\n\n'Well, I'll get my distaff ready, and take whatever flax the Fates\nsend--single, or double-twisted, as the powers please.'\n\n'That is the right spirit, Nelly. Keep it up, and see how happy life\nwill be with a brave heart, a willing hand, and plenty to do.'\n\n'No one objects to plenty of domestic work or fashionable pleasure, I\nfind; but the minute we begin to study, people tell us we can't bear it,\nand warn us to be very careful. I've tried the other things, and got so\ntired I came to college; though my people predict nervous exhaustion and\nan early death. Do you think there is any danger?' asked a stately girl,\nwith an anxious glance at the blooming face reflected in the mirror\nopposite.\n\n'Are you stronger or weaker than when you came two years ago, Miss\nWinthrop?'\n\n'Stronger in body, and much happier in mind. I think I was dying of\nennui; but the doctors called it inherited delicacy of constitution.\nThat is why mamma is so anxious, and I wish not to go too fast.'\n\n'Don't worry, my dear; that active brain of yours was starving for good\nfood; it has plenty now, and plain living suits you better than luxury\nand dissipation. It is all nonsense about girls not being able to study\nas well as boys. Neither can bear cramming; but with proper care both\nare better for it; so enjoy the life your instinct led you to, and we\nwill prove that wise headwork is a better cure for that sort of delicacy\nthan tonics, and novels on the sofa, where far too many of our girls\ngo to wreck nowadays. They burn the candle at both ends; and when they\nbreak down they blame the books, not the balls.'\n\n'Dr Nan was telling me about a patient of hers who thought she had\nheart-complaint, till Nan made her take off her corsets, stopped her\ncoffee and dancing all night, and made her eat, sleep, walk, and live\nregularly for a time; and now she's a brilliant cure. Common sense\nversus custom, Nan said.'\n\n'I've had no headaches since I came here, and can do twice as much\nstudying as I did at home. It's the air, I think, and the fun of going\nahead of the boys,' said another girl, tapping her big forehead with\nher thimble, as if the lively brain inside was in good working order and\nenjoyed the daily gymnastics she gave it.\n\n'Quality, not quantity, wins the day, you know. Our brains may be\nsmaller, but I don't see that they fall short of what is required of\nthem; and if I'm not mistaken, the largest-headed man in our class is\nthe dullest,' said Nelly, with a solemn air which produced a gale of\nmerriment; for all knew that the young Goliath she mentioned had been\nmetaphorically slain by this quick-witted David on many a battle-field,\nto the great disgust of himself and his mates.\n\n'Mrs Brooke, do I gauge on the right or the wrong side?' asked the\nbest Greek scholar of her class, eyeing a black silk apron with a lost\nexpression.\n\n'The right, Miss Pierson; and leave a space between the tucks; it looks\nprettier so.'\n\n'I'll never make another; but it will save my dresses from ink-stains,\nso I'm glad I've got it'; and the erudite Miss Pierson laboured on,\nfinding it a harder task than any Greek root she ever dug up.\n\n'We paper-stainers must learn how to make shields, or we are lost.\nI'll give you a pattern of the pinafore I used to wear in my\n\"blood-and-thunder days\", as we call them,' said Mrs Jo, trying to\nremember what became of the old tin-kitchen which used to hold her\nworks.\n\n'Speaking of writers reminds me that my ambition is to be a George\nEliot, and thrill the world! It must be so splendid to know that one\nhas such power, and to hear people own that one possesses a \"masculine\nintellect\"! I don't care for most women's novels, but hers are immense;\ndon't you think so, Mrs Bhaer?' asked the girl with the big forehead,\nand torn braid on her skirt.\n\n'Yes; but they don't thrill me as little Charlotte Bronte's books do.\nThe brain is there, but the heart seems left out. I admire, but I don't\nlove, George Eliot; and her life is far sadder to me than Miss Bronte's,\nbecause, in spite of the genius, love, and fame, she missed the light\nwithout which no soul is truly great, good, or happy.'\n\n'Yes'm, I know; but still it's so romantic and sort of new and\nmysterious, and she was great in one sense. Her nerves and dyspepsia do\nrather destroy the illusion; but I adore famous people and mean to go\nand see all I can scare up in London some day.'\n\n'You will find some of the best of them busy about just the work I\nrecommend to you; and if you want to see a great lady, I'll tell you\nthat Mrs Laurence means to bring one here today. Lady Abercrombie is\nlunching with her, and after seeing the college is to call on us. She\nespecially wanted to see our sewing-school, as she is interested in\nthings of this sort, and gets them up at home.'\n\n'Bless me! I always imagined lords and ladies did nothing but ride round\nin a coach and six, go to balls, and be presented to the Queen in cocked\nhats, and trains and feathers,' exclaimed an artless young person from\nthe wilds of Maine, whither an illustrated paper occasionally wandered.\n\n'Not at all; Lord Abercrombie is over here studying up our American\nprison system, and my lady is busy with the schools--both very\nhigh-born, but the simplest and most sensible people I've met this long\ntime. They are neither of them young nor handsome, and dress plainly;\nso don't expect anything splendid. Mr Laurence was telling me last night\nabout a friend of his who met my lord in the hall, and owing to a rough\ngreatcoat and a red face, mistook him for a coachman, and said: \"Now,\nmy man, what do you want here?\" Lord Abercrombie mildly mentioned who\nhe was, and that he had come to dinner. And the poor host was much\nafflicted, saying afterward: \"Why didn't he wear his stars and garters?\nthen a fellow would know he was a lord.\"'\n\nThe girls laughed again, and a general rustle betrayed that each was\nprinking a bit before the titled guest arrived. Even Mrs Jo settled her\ncollar, and Mrs Meg felt if her cap was right, while Bess shook out\nher curls and Josie boldly consulted the glass; for they were women, in\nspite of philosophy and philanthropy.\n\n'Shall we all rise?' asked one girl, deeply impressed by the impending\nhonour.\n\n'It would be courteous.'\n\n'Shall we shake hands?'\n\n'No, I'll present you en masse, and your pleasant faces will be\nintroduction enough.'\n\n'I wish I'd worn my best dress. Ought to have told us,' whispered Sally.\n\n'Won't my folks be surprised when I tell them we have had a real lady to\ncall on us?' said another.\n\n'Don't look as if you'd never seen a gentlewoman before, Milly. We are\nnot all fresh from the wilderness,' added the stately damsel who, having\nMayflower ancestors, felt that she was the equal of all the crowned\nheads of Europe.\n\n'Hush, she's coming! Oh, my heart, what a bonnet!' cried the gay girl in\na stage whisper; and every eye was demurely fixed upon the busy hands as\nthe door opened to admit Mrs Laurence and her guest.\n\nIt was rather a shock to find, after the general introduction was over,\nthat this daughter of a hundred earls was a stout lady in a plain gown,\nand a rather weather-beaten bonnet, with a bag of papers in one hand\nand a note-book in the other. But the face was full of benevolence, the\nsonorous voice very kind, the genial manners very winning, and about the\nwhole person an indescribable air of high breeding which made beauty of\nno consequence, costume soon forgotten, and the moment memorable to the\nkeen-eyed girls whom nothing escaped.\n\nA little chat about the rise, growth, and success of this particular\nclass, and then Mrs Jo led the conversation to the English lady's\nwork, anxious to show her pupils how rank dignifies labour, and charity\nblesses wealth.\n\nIt was good for these girls to hear of the evening-schools supported and\ntaught by women whom they knew and honoured; of Miss Cobbe's eloquent\nprotest winning the protection of the law for abused wives; Mrs Butler\nsaving the lost; Mrs Taylor, who devoted one room in her historic house\nto a library for the servants; Lord Shaftesbury, busy with his new\ntenement-houses in the slums of London; of prison reforms; and all the\nbrave work being done in God's name by the rich and great for the humble\nand the poor. It impressed them more than many quiet home lectures would\nhave done, and roused an ambition to help when their time should come,\nwell knowing that even in glorious America there is still plenty to be\ndone before she is what she should be--truly just, and free, and great.\nThey were also quick to see that Lady Abercrombie treated all there as\nher equals, from stately Mrs Laurence, to little Josie, taking notes\nof everything and privately resolving to have some thick-soled English\nboots as soon as possible. No one would have guessed that she had a\nbig house in London, a castle in Wales, and a grand country seat in\nScotland, as she spoke of Parnassus with admiration, Plumfield as a\n'dear old home', and the college as an honour to all concerned in it.\nAt that, of course, every head went up a little, and when my lady left,\nevery hand was ready for the hearty shake the noble Englishwoman gave\nthem, with words they long remembered:\n\n'I am very pleased to see this much-neglected branch of a woman's\neducation so well conducted here, and I have to thank my friend\nMrs Laurence for one of the most charming pictures I've seen in\nAmerica--Penelope among her maids.'\n\nA group of smiling faces watched the stout boots trudge away, respectful\nglances followed the shabby bonnet till it was out of sight, and the\ngirls felt a truer respect for their titled guest than if she had come\nin the coach and six, with all her diamonds on.\n\n'I feel better about the \"odd jobs\" now. I only wish I could do them as\nwell as Lady Abercrombie does,' said one.\n\n'I thanked my stars my buttonholes were nice, for she looked at them and\nsaid: \"Quite workmanlike, upon my word,\" added another, feeling that her\ngingham gown had come to honour.\n\n'Her manners were as sweet and kind as Mrs Brooke's. Not a bit stiff or\ncondescending, as I expected. I see now what you meant, Mrs Bhaer, when\nyou said once that well-bred people were the same all the world over.'\n\nMrs Meg bowed her thanks for the compliment, and Mrs Bhaer said:\n\n'I know them when I see them, but never shall be a model of deportment\nmyself. I'm glad you enjoyed the little visit. Now, if you young people\ndon't want England to get ahead of us in many ways, you must bestir\nyourselves and keep abreast; for our sisters are in earnest, you see,\nand don't waste time worrying about their sphere, but make it wherever\nduty calls them.'\n\n'We will do our best, ma'am,' answered the girls heartily, and trooped\naway with their work-baskets, feeling that though they might never be\nHarriet Martineaus, Elizabeth Brownings, or George Eliots, they might\nbecome noble, useful, and independent women, and earn for themselves\nsome sweet title from the grateful lips of the poor, better than any a\nqueen could bestow.\n\n\n\nChapter 18. CLASS DAY\n\nThe clerk of the weather evidently has a regard for young people, and\nsends sunshine for class days as often as he can. An especially lovely\none shone over Plumfield as this interesting anniversary came round,\nbringing the usual accompaniments of roses, strawberries, white-gowned\ngirls, beaming youths, proud friends, and stately dignitaries full of\nwell-earned satisfaction with the yearly harvest. As Laurence College\nwas a mixed one, the presence of young women as students gave to the\noccasion a grace and animation entirely wanting where the picturesque\nhalf of creation appear merely as spectators. The hands that turned the\npages of wise books also possessed the skill to decorate the hall with\nflowers; eyes tired with study shone with hospitable warmth on the\nassembling guests; and under the white muslins beat hearts as full of\nambition, hope, and courage as those agitating the broadcloth of the\nruling sex.\n\nCollege Hill, Parnassus, and old Plum swarmed with cheery faces, as\nguests, students, and professors hurried to and fro in the pleasant\nexcitement of arriving and receiving. Everyone was welcomed cordially,\nwhether he rolled up in a fine carriage, or trudged afoot to see the\ngood son or daughter come to honour on the happy day that rewarded\nmany a mutual sacrifice. Mr Laurie and his wife were on the reception\ncommittee, and their lovely house was overflowing. Mrs Meg, with Daisy\nand Jo as aides, was in demand among the girls, helping on belated\ntoilettes, giving an eye to spreads, and directing the decorations. Mrs\nJo had her hands full as President's lady, and the mother of Ted; for it\ntook all the power and skill of that energetic woman to get her son into\nhis Sunday best.\n\nNot that he objected to be well arrayed; far from it; he adored good\nclothes, and owing to his great height already revelled in a dress-suit,\nbequeathed him by a dandy friend. The effect was very funny; but he\nwould wear it in spite of the jeers of his mates, and sighed vainly for\na beaver, because his stern parent drew the line there. He pleaded that\nEnglish lads of ten wore them and were 'no end nobby'; but his mother\nonly answered, with a consoling pat of the yellow mane:\n\n'My child, you are absurd enough now; if I let you add a tall hat,\nPlumfield wouldn't hold either of us, such would be the scorn and\nderision of all beholders. Content yourself with looking like the ghost\nof a waiter, and don't ask for the most ridiculous head-gear in the\nknown world.'\n\nDenied this noble badge of manhood, Ted soothed his wounded soul by\nappearing in collars of an amazing height and stiffness, and ties which\nwere the wonder of all female eyes. This freak was a sort of vengeance\non his hard-hearted mother; for the collars drove the laundress to\ndespair, never being just right, and the ties required such art in\nthe tying that three women sometimes laboured long before--like Beau\nBrummel--he turned from a heap of 'failures' with the welcome words:\n'That will do.' Rob was devoted on these trying occasions, his own\ntoilet being distinguished only by its speed, simplicity, and neatness.\nTed was usually in a frenzy before he was suited, and roars, whistles,\ncommands, and groans were heard from the den wherein the Lion raged and\nthe Lamb patiently toiled. Mrs Jo bore it till boots were hurled and a\nrain of hair-brushes set in, then, fearing for the safety of her eldest,\nshe would go to the rescue, and by a wise mixture of fun and authority\nfinally succeed in persuading Ted that he was 'a thing of beauty',\nif not 'a joy for ever'. At last he would stalk majestically forth,\nimprisoned in collars compared to which those worn by Dickens's\nafflicted Biler were trifles not worth mentioning. The dresscoat was\na little loose in the shoulders, but allowed a noble expanse of glossy\nbosom to be seen, and with a delicate handkerchief negligently drooping\nat the proper angle, had a truly fine effect. Boots that shone,\nand likewise pinched, appeared at one end of the 'long, black\nclothes-pin'--as Josie called him---and a youthful but solemn face at\nthe other, carried at an angle which, if long continued, would have\nresulted in spinal curvature. Light gloves, a cane, and--oh, bitter drop\nin the cup of joy!--an ignominious straw hat, not to mention a choice\nfloweret in the buttonhole, and a festoon of watchguard below, finished\noff this impressive boy.\n\n'How's that for style?' he asked, appearing to his mother and cousins\nwhom he was to escort to the hall on this particular occasion.\n\nA shout of laughter greeted him, followed by exclamations of horror;\nfor he had artfully added the little blond moustache he often wore when\nacting. It was very becoming, and seemed the only balm to heal the wound\nmade by the loss of the beloved hat.\n\n'Take it off this moment, you audacious boy! What would your father say\nto such a prank on this day when we must all behave our best?' said Mrs\nJo, trying to frown, but privately thinking that among the many youths\nabout her none were so beautiful and original as her long son.\n\n'Let him wear it, Aunty; it's so becoming. No one will ever guess he\nisn't eighteen at least,' cried Josie, to whom disguise of any sort was\nalways charming.\n\n'Father won't observe it; he'll be absorbed in his big-wigs and the\ngirls. No matter if he does, he'll enjoy the joke and introduce me as\nhis oldest son. Rob is nowhere when I'm in full fig'; and Ted took the\nstage with a tragic stalk, like Hamlet in a tail-coat and choker.\n\n'My son, obey me!' and when Mrs Jo spoke in that tone her word was\nlaw. Later, however, the moustache appeared, and many strangers firmly\nbelieved that there were three young Bhaers. So Ted found one ray of joy\nto light his gloom.\n\nMr Bhaer was a proud and happy man when, at the appointed hour, he\nlooked down upon the parterre of youthful faces before him, thinking of\nthe 'little gardens' in which he had hopefully and faithfully sowed good\nseed years ago, and from which this beautiful harvest seemed to have\nsprung. Mr March's fine old face shone with the serenest satisfaction,\nfor this was the dream of his life fulfilled after patient waiting; and\nthe love and reverence in the countenances of the eager young men and\nwomen looking up at him plainly showed that the reward he coveted was\nhis in fullest measure. Laurie always effaced himself on these occasions\nas much as courtesy would permit; for everyone spoke gratefully in ode,\npoem, and oration of the founder of the college and noble dispenser of\nhis beneficence. The three sisters beamed with pride as they sat among\nthe ladies, enjoying, as only women can, the honour done the men\nthey loved; while 'the original Plums', as the younger ones called\nthemselves, regarded the whole affair as their work, receiving the\ncurious, admiring, or envious glances of strangers with a mixture of\ndignity and delight rather comical to behold.\n\nThe music was excellent, and well it might be when Apollo waved the\nbaton. The poems were--as usual on such occasions--of varied excellence,\nas the youthful speakers tried to put old truths into new words, and\nmade them forceful by the enthusiasm of their earnest faces and fresh\nvoices. It was beautiful to see the eager interest with which the girls\nlistened to some brilliant brother-student, and applauded him with a\nrustle as of wind over a bed of flowers. It was still more significant\nand pleasant to watch the young men's faces when a slender white figure\nstood out against the background of black-coated dignitaries, and with\ncheeks that flushed and paled, and lips that trembled till earnest\npurpose conquered maiden fear, spoke to them straight out of a woman's\nheart and brain concerning the hopes and doubts, the aspirations and\nrewards all must know, desire, and labour for. This clear, sweet voice\nseemed to reach and rouse all that was noblest in the souls of these\nyouths, and to set a seal upon the years of comradeship which made them\nsacred and memorable for ever.\n\nAlice Heath's oration was unanimously pronounced the success of the day;\nfor without being flowery or sentimental, as is too apt to be the case\nwith these first efforts of youthful orators, it was earnest, sensible,\nand so inspiring that she left the stage in a storm of applause, the\ngood fellows being as much fired by her stirring appeal to 'march\nshoulder to shoulder', as if she had chanted the 'Marseillaise' then\nand there. One young man was so excited that he nearly rushed out of his\nseat to receive her as she hastened to hide herself among her mates, who\nwelcomed her with faces full of tender pride and tearful eye. A prudent\nsister detained him, however, and in a moment he was able to listen with\ncomposure to the President's remarks.\n\nThey were worth listening to, for Mr Bhaer spoke like a father to the\nchildren whom he was dismissing to the battle of life; and his tender,\nwise, and helpful words lingered in their hearts long after the praise\nwas forgotten. Then came other exercises peculiar to Plumfield, and the\nend. Why the roof did not fly off when the sturdy lungs of the excited\nyoung men pealed out the closing hymn will for ever be a mystery; but\nit remained firm, and only the fading garlands vibrated as the waves of\nmusic rolled up and died away, leaving sweet echoes to haunt the place\nfor another year.\n\nDinners and spreads consumed the afternoon, and at sunset came a slight\nlull as everyone sought some brief repose before the festivities of the\nevening began. The President's reception was one of the enjoyable things\nin store, also dancing on Parnassus, and as much strolling, singing, and\nflirting, as could be compressed into a few hours by youths and maidens\njust out of school.\n\nCarriages were rolling about, and gay groups on piazzas, lawns, and\nwindow-seats idly speculated as to who the distinguished guests might\nbe. The appearance of a very dusty vehicle loaded with trunks at Mr\nBhaer's hospitably open door caused much curious comment among the\nloungers, especially as two rather foreign-looking gentlemen sprang out,\nfollowed by two young ladies, all four being greeted with cries of joy\nand much embracing by the Bhaers. Then they all disappeared into the\nhouse, the luggage followed, and the watchers were left to wonder who\nthe mysterious strangers were, till a fair collegian declared that they\nmust be the Professor's nephews, one of whom was expected on his wedding\njourney.\n\nShe was right; Franz proudly presented his blonde and buxom bride, and\nshe was hardly kissed and blessed when Emil led up his bonny English\nMary, with the rapturous announcement:\n\n'Uncle, Aunt Jo, here's another daughter! Have you room for my wife,\ntoo?'\n\nThere could be no doubt of that; and Mary was with difficulty rescued\nfrom the glad embraces of her new relatives, who, remembering all the\nyoung pair had suffered together, felt that this was the natural and\nhappy ending of the long voyage so perilously begun.\n\n'But why not tell us, and let us be ready for two brides instead of\none?' asked Mrs Jo, looking as usual rather demoralizing in a wrapper\nand crimping-pins, having rushed down from her chamber, where she was\npreparing for the labours of the evening.\n\n'Well, I remembered what a good joke you all considered Uncle Laurie's\nmarriage, and I thought I'd give you another nice little surprise,'\nlaughed Emil. 'I'm off duty, and it seemed best to take advantage of\nwind and tide, and come along as convoy to the old boy here. We hoped to\nget in last night, but couldn't fetch it, so here we are in time for the\nend of the jollification, anyway.'\n\n'Ah, my sons, it is too feeling-full to see you both so happy and again\nin the old home. I haf no words to outpour my gratitude, and can\nonly ask of the dear Gott in Himmel to bless and keep you all,' cried\nProfessor Bhaer, trying to gather all four into his arms at once, while\ntears rolled down his cheeks, and his English failed him.\n\nAn April shower cleared the air and relieved the full hearts of the\nhappy family; then of course everyone began to talk--Franz and Ludmilla\nin German with uncle, Emil and Mary with the aunts; and round this group\ngathered the young folk, clamouring to hear all about the wreck, and the\nrescue, and the homeward voyage. It was a very different story from the\nwritten one; and as they listened to Emil's graphic words, with Mary's\nsoft voice breaking in now and then to add some fact that brought out\nthe courage, patience, and self-sacrifice he so lightly touched upon, it\nbecame a solemn and pathetic thing to see and hear these happy creatures\ntell of that great danger and deliverance.\n\n'I never hear the patter of rain now that I don't want to say my\nprayers; and as for women, I'd like to take my hat off to every one of\n'em, for they are braver than any man I ever saw,' said Emil, with the\nnew gravity that was as becoming to him as the new gentleness with which\nhe treated everyone.\n\n'If women are brave, some men are as tender and self-sacrificing as\nwomen. I know one who in the night slipped his share of food into a\ngirl's pocket, though starving himself, and sat for hours rocking a sick\nman in his arms that he might get a little sleep. No, love, I will tell,\nand you must let me!' cried Mary, holding in both her own the hand he\nlaid on her lips to silence her.\n\n'Only did my duty. If that torment had lasted much longer I might\nhave been as bad as poor Barry and the boatswain. Wasn't that an awful\nnight?' And Emil shuddered as he recalled it.\n\n'Don't think of it, dear. Tell about the happy days on the Urania, when\npapa grew better and we were all safe and homeward bound,' said Mary,\nwith the trusting look and comforting touch which seemed to banish the\ndark and recall the bright side of that terrible experience.\n\nEmil cheered up at once, and sitting with his arm about his 'dear lass',\nin true sailor fashion told the happy ending of the tale.\n\n'Such a jolly old time as we had at Hamburg! Uncle Hermann couldn't do\nenough for the captain, and while mamma took care of him, Mary looked\nafter me. I had to go into dock for repairs; fire hurt my eyes, and\nwatching for a sail and want of sleep made 'em as hazy as a London fog.\nShe was pilot and brought me in all right, you see, only I couldn't part\ncompany, so she came aboard as first mate, and I'm bound straight for\nglory now.'\n\n'Hush! that's silly, dear,' whispered Mary, trying in her turn to stop\nhim, with English shyness about tender topics. But he took the soft hand\nin his, and proudly surveying the one ring it wore, went on with the air\nof an admiral aboard his flagship.\n\n'The captain proposed waiting a spell; but I told him we weren't like\nto see any rougher weather than we'd pulled through together, and if we\ndidn't know one another after such a year as this, we never should. I\nwas sure I shouldn't be worth my pay without this hand on the wheel; so\nI had my way, and my brave little woman has shipped for the long voyage.\nGod bless her!'\n\n'Shall you really sail with him?' asked Daisy, admiring her courage, but\nshrinking with cat-like horror from the water.\n\n'I'm not afraid,' answered Mary, with a loyal smile. 'I've proved my\ncaptain in fair weather and in foul, and if he is ever wrecked again,\nI'd rather be with him than waiting and watching ashore.'\n\n'A true woman, and a born sailor's wife! You are a happy man, Emil, and\nI'm sure this trip will be a prosperous one,' cried Mrs Jo, delighted\nwith the briny flavour of this courtship. 'Oh, my dear boy, I always\nfelt you'd come back, and when everyone else despaired I never gave up,\nbut insisted that you were clinging to the main-top jib somewhere on\nthat dreadful sea'; and Mrs Jo illustrated her faith by grasping Emil\nwith a truly Pillycoddian gesture.\n\n'Of course I was!' answered Emil heartily; 'and my \"main-top jib\" in\nthis case was the thought of what you and Uncle said to me. That kept\nme up; and among the million thoughts that came to me during those\nlong nights none was clearer than the idea of the red strand, you\nremember--English navy, and all that. I liked the notion, and resolved\nthat if a bit of my cable was left afloat, the red stripe should be\nthere.'\n\n'And it was, my dear, it was! Captain Hardy testifies to that, and here\nis your reward'; and Mrs Jo kissed Mary with a maternal tenderness\nwhich betrayed that she liked the English rose better than the blue-eyed\nGerman Kornblumen, sweet and modest though it was.\n\nEmil surveyed the little ceremony with complacency, saying, as he looked\nabout the room which he never thought to see again: 'Odd, isn't it,\nhow clearly trifles come back to one in times of danger? As we floated\nthere, half-starved, and in despair, I used to think I heard the bells\nringing here, and Ted tramping downstairs, and you calling, \"Boys, boys,\nit's time to get up!\" I actually smelt the coffee we used to have,\nand one night I nearly cried when I woke from a dream of Asia's ginger\ncookies. I declare, it was one of the bitterest disappointments of my\nlife to face hunger with that spicy smell in my nostrils. If you've got\nany, do give me one!'\n\nA pitiful murmur broke from all the aunts and cousins, and Emil was at\nonce borne away to feast on the desired cookies, a supply always being\non hand. Mrs Jo and her sister joined the other group, glad to hear what\nFranz was saying about Nat.\n\n'The minute I saw how thin and shabby he was, I knew that something was\nwrong; but he made light of it, and was so happy over our visit and\nnews that I let him off with a brief confession, and went to Professor\nBaumgarten and Bergmann. From them I learned the whole story of\nhis spending more money than he ought and trying to atone for it by\nunnecessary work and sacrifice. Baumgarten thought it would do him good,\nso kept his secret till I came. It did him good, and he's paid his debts\nand earned his bread by the sweat of his brow, like an honest fellow.'\n\n'I like that much in Nat. It is, as I said, a lesson, and he learns\nit well. He proves himself a man, and has deserved the place Bergmann\noffers him,' said Mr Bhaer, looking well pleased as Franz added some\nfacts already recorded.\n\n'I told you, Meg, that he had good stuff in him, and love for Daisy\nwould keep him straight. Dear lad, I wish I had him here this moment!'\ncried Mrs Jo, forgetting in delight the doubts and anxieties which had\ntroubled her for months past.\n\n'I am very glad, and suppose I shall give in as I always do, especially\nnow that the epidemic rages so among us. You and Emil have set all their\nheads in a ferment, and Josie will be demanding a lover before I can\nturn round,' answered Mrs Meg, in a tone of despair.\n\nBut her sister saw that she was touched by Nat's trials, and hastened\nto add the triumphs, that the victory might be complete, for success is\nalways charming.\n\n'This offer of Herr Bergmann is a good one, isn't it?' she asked, though\nMr Laurie had already satisfied her on that point when Nat's letter\nbrought the news.\n\n'Very fine in every way. Nat will get capital drill in Bachmeister's\norchestra, see London in a delightful way, and if he suits come home\nwith them, well started among the violins. No great honour, but a sure\nthing and a step up. I congratulated him, and he was very jolly over it,\nsaying, like the true lover he is: \"Tell Daisy; be sure and tell her all\nabout it.\" I'll leave that to you, Aunt Meg, and you can also break it\ngently to her that the old boy had a fine blond beard. Very becoming;\nhides his weak mouth, and gives a noble air to his big eyes and\n\"Mendelssohnian brow\", as a gushing girl called it. Ludmilla has a photo\nof it for you.'\n\nThis amused them; and they listened to many other interesting bits of\nnews which kind Franz, even in his own happiness, had not forgotten to\nremember for his friend's sake. He talked so well, and painted Nat's\npatient and pathetic shifts so vividly, that Mrs Meg was half won;\nthough if she had learned of the Minna episode and the fiddling in\nbeer-gardens and streets, she might not have relented so soon. She\nstored up all she heard, however, and, womanlike, promised herself a\ndelicious talk with Daisy, in which she would allow herself to melt by\ndegrees, and perhaps change the doubtful 'We shall see' to a cordial 'He\nhas done well; be happy, dear'.\n\nIn the midst of this agreeable chat the sudden striking of a clock\nrecalled Mrs Jo from romance to reality, and she exclaimed, with a\nclutch at her crimping-pins:\n\n'My blessed people, you must eat and rest; and I must dress, or receive\nin this disgraceful rig. Meg, will you take Ludmilla and Mary upstairs\nand see to them? Franz knows the way to the dining-room. Fritz, come\nwith me and be made tidy, for what with heat and emotion, we are both\nperfect wrecks.'\n\n\n\nChapter 19. WHITE ROSES\n\nWhile the travellers refreshed, and Mrs President struggled into her\nbest gown, Josie ran into the garden to gather flowers for the brides.\nThe sudden arrival of these interesting beings had quite enchanted\nthe romantic girl, and her head was full of heroic rescues, tender\nadmiration, dramatic situations, and feminine wonder as to whether the\nlovely creatures would wear their veils or not. She was standing before\na great bush of white roses, culling the most perfect for the bouquets\nwhich she meant to tie with the ribbon festooned over her arm, and lay\non the toilette tables of the new cousins, as a delicate attention. A\nstep startled her, and looking up she saw her brother coming down the\npath with folded arms, bent head, and the absent air of one absorbed in\ndeep thought.\n\n'Sophy Wackles,' said the sharp child, with a superior smile, as\nshe sucked her thumb just pricked by a too eager pull at the thorny\nbranches.\n\n'What are you at here, Mischief?' asked Demi, with an Irvingesque start,\nas he felt rather than saw a disturbing influence in his day-dream.\n\n'Getting flowers for \"our brides\". Don't you wish you had one?' answered\nJosie, to whom the word 'mischief' suggested her favourite amusement.\n\n'A bride or a flower?' asked Demi calmly, though he eyed the blooming\nbush as if it had a sudden and unusual interest for him.\n\n'Both; you get the one, and I'll give you the other.'\n\n'Wish I could!' and Demi picked a little bud, with a sigh that went to\nJosie's warm heart.\n\n'Why don't you, then? It's lovely to see people so happy. Now's a good\ntime to do it if you ever mean to. She will be going away for ever\nsoon.'\n\n'Who?' and Demi pulled a half-opened bud, with a sudden colour in his\nown face; which sign of confusion delighted little Jo.\n\n'Don't be a hypocrite. You know I mean Alice. Now, Jack, I'm fond\nof you, and want to help; it's so interesting--all these lovers and\nweddings and things, and we ought to have our share. So you take my\nadvice and speak up like a man, and make sure of Alice before she goes.'\n\nDemi laughed at the seriousness of the small girl's advice; but he liked\nit, and showed that it suited him by saying blandly, instead of snubbing\nher as usual:\n\n'You are very kind, child. Since you are so wise, could you give me a\nhint how I'd better 'speak up', as you elegantly express it?'\n\n'Oh, well, there are various ways, you know. In plays the lovers go down\non their knees; but that's awkward when they have long legs. Ted never\ndoes it well, though I drill him for hours. You could say, \"Be mine,\nbe mine!\" like the old man who threw cucumbers over the wall to Mrs\nNickleby, if you want to be gay and easy; or you could write a poetical\npop. You've tried it, I dare say.'\n\n'But seriously, Jo, I do love Alice, and I think she knows it. I want\nto tell her so; but I lose my head when I try, and don't care to make a\nfool of myself. Thought you might suggest some pretty way; you read so\nmuch poetry and are so romantic.'\n\nDemi tried to express himself clearly, but forgot his dignity and his\nusual reserve in the sweet perplexity of his love, and asked his little\nsister to teach him how to put the question which a single word can\nanswer. The arrival of his happy cousins had scattered all his wise\nplans and brave resolutions to wait still longer. The Christmas play\nhad given him courage to hope, and the oration today had filled him with\ntender pride; but the sight of those blooming brides and beaming grooms\nwas too much for him, and he panted to secure his Alice without an\nhour's delay. Daisy was his confidante in all things but this; a\nbrotherly feeling of sympathy had kept him from telling her his hopes,\nbecause her own were forbidden. His mother was rather jealous of any\ngirl he admired; but knowing that she liked Alice, he loved on and\nenjoyed his secret alone, meaning soon to tell her all about it.\n\nNow suddenly Josie and the rose-bush seemed to suggest a speedy end\nto his tender perplexities; and he was moved to accept her aid as the\nnetted lion did that of the mouse.\n\n'I think I'll write,' he was slowly beginning, after a pause during\nwhich both were trying to strike out a new and brilliant idea.\n\n'I've got it! perfectly lovely! just suit her, and you too, being a\npoet!' cried Josie, with a skip.\n\n'What is it? Don't be ridiculous, please,' begged the bashful lover,\neager, but afraid of this sharp-tongued bit of womanhood.\n\n'I read in one of Miss Edgeworth's stories about a man who offers three\nroses to his lady--a bud, a half-blown, and a full-blown rose. I don't\nremember which she took; but it's a pretty way; and Alice knows about\nit because she was there when we read it. Here are all kinds; you've got\nthe two buds, pick the sweetest rose you can find, and I'll tie them up\nand put them in her room. She is coming to dress with Daisy, so I can do\nit nicely.'\n\nDemi mused a moment with his eyes on the bridal bush, and a smile came\nover his face so unlike any it had ever worn before, that Josie was\ntouched, and looked away as if she had no right to see the dawn of the\ngreat passion which, while it lasts, makes a young man as happy as a\ngod.\n\n'Do it,' was all he said, and gathered a full-blown rose to finish his\nfloral love-message.\n\nCharmed to have a finger in this romantic pie, Josie tied a graceful\nbow of ribbon about the stems, and finished her last nosegay with much\ncontent, while Demi wrote upon a card:\n\nDEAR ALICE, You know what the flowers mean. Will you wear one, or all\ntonight, and make me still prouder, fonder, and happier than I am?\n\nYours entirely,\n\nJOHN\n\n\nOffering this to his sister, he said in a tone that made her feel the\ndeep importance of her mission:\n\n'I trust you, Jo. This means everything to me. No jokes, dear, if you\nlove me.'\n\nJosie's answer was a kiss that promised all things; and then she ran\naway to do her 'gentle spiriting', like Ariel, leaving Demi to dream\namong the roses like Ferdinand.\n\nMary and Ludmilla were charmed with their bouquets; and the giver had\nthe delight of putting some of the flowers into the dark hair and\nthe light as she played maid at the toilettes of 'our brides', which\nconsoled her for a disappointment in the matter of veils.\n\nNo one helped Alice dress; for Daisy was in the next room with her\nmother; and not even their loving eyes saw the welcome which the little\nposy received, nor the tears and smiles and blushes that came and went\nas she read the note and pondered what answer she should give. There was\nno doubt about the one she wished to give; but duty held her back; for\nat home there was an invalid mother and an old father. She was needed\nthere, with all the help she could now bring by the acquirements four\nyears of faithful study had given her. Love looked very sweet, and a\nhome of her own with John a little heaven on earth; but not yet. And\nshe slowly laid away the full-blown rose as she sat before the mirror,\nthinking over the great question of her life.\n\nWas it wise and kind to ask him to wait, to bind him by any promise,\nor even to put into words the love and honour she felt for him? No; it\nwould be more generous to make the sacrifice alone, and spare him the\npain of hope deferred. He was young; he would forget; and she would do\nher duty better, perhaps, if no impatient lover waited for her. With\neyes that saw but dimly, and a hand that lingered on the stem he had\nstripped of thorns, she laid the half-blown flower by the rose, and\nasked herself if even the little bud might be worn. It looked very poor\nand pale beside the others; yet being in the self-sacrificing mood which\nreal love brings, she felt that even a small hope was too much to give,\nif she could not follow it up with more.\n\nAs she sat looking sadly down on the symbols of an affection that grew\ndearer every moment, she listened half unconsciously to the murmur of\nvoices in the adjoining room. Open windows, thin partitions, and the\nstillness of summer twilight made it impossible to help hearing, and in\na few moments more she could not refrain; for they were talking of John.\n\n'So nice of Ludmilla to bring us all bottles of real German cologne!\nJust what we need after this tiring day! Be sure John has his! He likes\nit so!'\n\n'Yes, mother. Did you see him jump up when Alice ended her oration?\nHe'd have gone to her if I hadn't held him back. I don't wonder he was\npleased and proud. I spoilt my gloves clapping, and quite forgot my\ndislike of seeing women on platforms, she was so earnest and unconscious\nand sweet after the first moment.'\n\n'Has he said anything to you, dear?'\n\n'No; and I guess why. The kind boy thinks it would make me unhappy. It\nwouldn't. But I know his ways; so I wait, and hope all will go well with\nhim.'\n\n'It must. No girl in her senses would refuse our John, though he isn't\nrich, and never will be. Daisy, I've been longing to tell you what he\ndid with his money. He told me last night, and I've had no time since to\ntell you. He sent poor young Barton to the hospital, and kept him there\ntill his eyes were saved--a costly thing to do. But the man can work now\nand care for his old parents. He was in despair, sick and poor, and too\nproud to beg; and our dear boy found it out, and took every penny he\nhad, and never told even his mother till she made him.'\n\nAlice did not hear what Daisy answered, for she was busy with her own\nemotions--happy ones now, to judge from the smile that shone in her eyes\nand the decided gesture with which she put the little bud in her bosom,\nas if she said: 'He deserves some reward for that good deed, and he\nshall have it.'\n\nMrs Meg was speaking, and still of John, when she could hear again:\n\n'Some people would call it unwise and reckless, when John has so little;\nbut I think his first investment a safe and good one, for \"he who giveth\nto the poor lendeth to the Lord\"; and I was so pleased and proud, I\nwouldn't spoil it by offering him a penny.'\n\n'It is his having nothing to offer that keeps him silent, I think. He\nis so honest, he won't ask till he has much to give. But he forgets that\nlove is everything. I know he's rich in that; I see and feel it; and any\nwoman should be glad to get it.'\n\n'Right, dear. I felt just so, and was willing to work and wait with and\nfor my John.'\n\n'So she will be, and I hope they will find it out. But she is so dutiful\nand good, I'm afraid she won't let herself be happy. You would like it,\nmother?'\n\n'Heartily; for a better, nobler girl doesn't live. She is all I want for\nmy son; and I don't mean to lose the dear, brave creature if I can help\nit. Her heart is big enough for both love and duty; and they can wait\nmore happily if they do it together--for wait they must, of course.'\n\n'I'm so glad his choice suits you, mother, and he is spared the saddest\nsort of disappointment.'\n\nDaisy's voice broke there; and a sudden rustle, followed by a soft\nmurmur, seemed to tell that she was in her mother's arms, seeking and\nfinding comfort there.\n\nAlice heard no more, and shut her window with a guilty feeling but a\nshining face; for the proverb about listeners failed here, and she had\nlearned more than she dared to hope. Things seemed to change suddenly;\nshe felt that her heart was large enough for both love and duty; she\nknew now that she would be welcomed by mother and sister; and the memory\nof Daisy's less happy fate, Nat's weary probation, the long delay,\nand possible separation for ever--all came before her so vividly that\nprudence seemed cruelty; self-sacrifice, sentimental folly; and anything\nbut the whole truth, disloyalty to her lover. As she thought thus,\nthe half-blown rose went to join the bud; and then, after a pause, she\nslowly kissed the perfect rose, and added it to the tell-tale group,\nsaying to herself with a sort of sweet solemnity, as if the words were a\nvow:\n\n'I'll love and work and wait with and for my John.'\n\nIt was well for her that Demi was absent when she stole down to join the\nguests who soon began to flow through the house in a steady stream.\nThe new brightness which touched her usually thoughtful face was easily\nexplained by the congratulations she received as orator, and the slight\nagitation observable, when a fresh batch of gentlemen approached soon\npassed, as none of them noticed the flowers she wore over a very happy\nheart. Demi meantime was escorting certain venerable personages about\nthe college, and helping his grandfather entertain them with discussion\nof the Socratic method of instruction, Pythagoras, Pestalozzi, Froebel,\nand the rest, whom he devoutly wished at the bottom of the Red Sea, and\nno wonder, for his head and his heart were full of love and roses, hopes\nand fears. He piloted the 'potent, grave, and reverend seigniors' safely\ndown to Plumfield at last, and landed them before his uncle and aunt\nBhaer, who were receiving in state, the one full of genuine delight in\nall men and things, the other suffering martyrdom with a smile, as she\nstood shaking hand after hand, and affecting utter unconsciousness of\nthe sad fact that ponderous Professor Plock had camped upon the train of\nher state and festival velvet gown.\n\nWith a long sigh of relief Demi glanced about him for the beloved girl.\nMost persons would have looked some time before any particular angel\ncould be discovered among the white-robed throng in parlours, hall,\nand study; but his eye went--like the needle to the pole--to the corner\nwhere a smooth dark head, with its braided crown, rose like a queen's,\nhe thought, above the crowd which surrounded her. Yes, she has a flower\nat her throat; one, two, oh, blessed sight! he saw it all across the\nroom, and gave a rapturous sigh which caused Miss Perry's frizzled crop\nto wave with a sudden gust. He did not see the rose, for it was\nhidden by a fold of lace; and it was well, perhaps, that bliss came by\ninstalments, or he might have electrified the assembled multitude by\nflying to his idol, there being no Daisy to clutch him by the coat-tail.\nA stout lady, thirsting for information, seized him at that thrilling\nmoment, and he was forced to point out celebrities with a saintly\npatience which deserved a better reward than it received; for a certain\nabsence of mind and incoherence of speech at times caused the ungrateful\ndowager to whisper to the first friend she met after he had escaped:\n\n'I saw no wine at any of the spreads; but it is plain that young Brooke\nhas had too much. Quite gentlemanly, but evidently a trifle intoxicated,\nmy dear.'\n\nAh, so he was! but with a diviner wine than any that ever sparkled at a\nclass-day lunch, though many collegians know the taste of it; and when\nthe old lady was disposed of, he gladly turned to find the young one,\nbent on having a single word. He saw her standing by the piano now,\nidly turning over music as she talked with several gentlemen. Hiding his\nimpatience under an air of scholastic repose, Demi hovered near, ready\nto advance when the happy moment came, wondering meantime why elderly\npersons persisted in absorbing young ones instead of sensibly sitting\nin corners with their contemporaries. The elderly persons in question\nretired at length, but only to be replaced by two impetuous youths who\nbegged Miss Heath to accompany them to Parnassus and join the dance.\nDemi thirsted for their blood, but was appeased by hearing George and\nDolly say, as they lingered a moment after her refusal:\n\n'Really, you know, I'm quite converted to co-education and almost wish\nI'd remained here. It gives a grace to study, a sort of relish even to\nGreek to see charming girls at it,' said Stuffy, who found the feast\nof learning so dry, any sauce was welcome; and he felt as if he had\ndiscovered a new one.\n\n'Yes, by Jove! we fellows will have to look out or you'll carry off all\nthe honours. You were superb today, and held us all like magic, though\nit was so hot there, I really think I couldn't have stood it for anyone\nelse,' added Dolly, labouring to be gallant and really offering a\ntouching proof of devotion; for the heat melted his collar, took the\ncurl out of his hair, and ruined his gloves.\n\n'There is room for all; and if you will leave us the books, we will\ncheerfully yield the baseball, boating, dancing, and flirting, which\nseem to be the branches you prefer,' answered Alice sweetly.\n\n'Ah, now you are too hard upon us! We can't grind all the time and you\nladies don't seem to mind taking a turn at the two latter \"branches\" you\nmention,' returned Dolly, with a glance at George which plainly said, 'I\nhad her there.'\n\n'Some of us do in our first years. Later we give up childish things, you\nsee. Don't let me keep you from Parnassus'; and a smiling nod dismissed\nthem, smarting under the bitter consciousness of youth.\n\n'You got it there, Doll. Better not try to fence with these superior\ngirls. Sure to be routed, horse, foot, and dragoons,' said Stuffy,\nlumbering away, somewhat cross with too many spreads.\n\n'So deuced sarcastic! Don't believe she's much older than we are.\nGirls grow up quicker, so she needn't put on airs and talk like a\ngrandmother,' muttered Dolly, feeling that he had sacrificed his kids\nupon the altar of an ungrateful Pallas.\n\n'Come along and let's find something to eat. I'm faint with so much\ntalking. Old Plock cornered me and made my head spin with Kant and Hegel\nand that lot.'\n\n'I promised Dora West I'd give her a turn. Must look her up; she's a\njolly little thing, and doesn't bother about anything but keeping in\nstep.'\n\nAnd arm in arm the boys strolled away, leaving Alice to read music as\ndiligently as if society had indeed no charms for her. As she bent to\nturn a page, the eager young man behind the piano saw the rose and was\nstruck speechless with delight. A moment he gazed, then hastened to\nseize the coveted place before a new detachment of bores arrived.\n\n'Alice, I can't believe it--did you understand--how shall I ever thank\nyou?' murmured Demi, bending as if he, too, read the song, not a note or\nword of which did he see, however.\n\n'Hush! not now. I understood--I don't deserve it--we are too young, we\nmust wait, but--I'm very proud and happy, John!'\n\nWhat would have happened after that tender whisper I tremble to think,\nif Tom Bangs had not come bustling up, with the cheerful remark:\n\n'Music? just the thing. People are thinning out, and we all want a\nlittle refreshment. My brain fairly reels with the 'ologies and 'isms\nI've heard discussed tonight. Yes, give us this; sweet thing! Scotch\nsongs are always charming.'\n\nDemi glowered; but the obtuse boy never saw it, and Alice, feeling that\nthis would be a safe vent for sundry unruly emotions, sat down at once,\nand sang the song which gave her answer better than she could have done:\n\n                BIDE A WEE\n\n    'The puir auld folk at home, ye mind,\n    Are frail and failing sair;\n    And weel I ken they'd miss me, lad,\n    Gin I come hame nae mair.\n    The grist is out, the times are hard,\n    The kine are only three;\n    I canna leave the auld folk now.\n    We'd better bide a wee.\n\n    'I fear me sair they're failing baith;\n    For when I sit apart,\n    They talk o' Heaven so earnestly,\n    It well nigh breaks my heart.\n    So, laddie, dinna urge me now,\n    It surely winna be;\n    I canna leave the auld folk yet.\n    We'd better bide a wee.'\n\nThe room was very still before the first verse ended; and Alice skipped\nthe next, fearing she could not get through; for John's eyes were on\nher, showing that he knew she sang for him and let the plaintive little\nballad tell what her reply must be. He took it as she meant it, and\nsmiled at her so happily that her heart got the better of her voice, and\nshe rose abruptly, saying something about the heat.\n\n'Yes, you are tired; come out and rest, my dearest'; and with a\nmasterful air Demi took her into the starlight, leaving Tom to stare\nafter them winking as if a sky-rocket had suddenly gone off under his\nnose.\n\n'Bless my soul! the Deacon really meant business last summer and never\ntold me. Won't Dora laugh?' And Tom departed in hot haste to impart and\nexult over his discovery.\n\nWhat was said in the garden was never exactly known; but the Brooke\nfamily sat up very late that night, and any curious eye at the window\nwould have seen Demi receiving the homage of his womankind as he told\nhis little romance. Josie took great credit to herself in the matter,\ninsisting that she had made the match; Daisy was full of the sweetest\nsympathy and joy, and Mrs Meg so happy that when Jo had gone to dream\nof bridal veils, and Demi sat in his room blissfully playing the air of\n'Bide a Wee', she had her talk about Nat, ending with her arms round her\ndutiful daughter and these welcome words as her reward:\n\n'Wait till Nat comes home, and then my good girl shall wear white roses\ntoo.'\n\n\n\nChapter 20. LIFE FOR LIFE\n\nThe summer days that followed were full of rest and pleasure for young\nand old, as they did the honours of Plumfield to their happy guests.\nWhile Franz and Emil were busy with the affairs of Uncle Hermann and\nCaptain Hardy, Mary and Ludmilla made friends everywhere; for, though\nvery unlike, both were excellent and charming girls. Mrs Meg and Daisy\nfound the German bride a Hausfrau after their own hearts, and had\ndelightful times learning new dishes, hearing about the semi-yearly\nwashes and the splendid linen-room at Hamburg, or discussing domestic\nlife in all its branches. Ludmilla not only taught, but learned, many\nthings, and went home with many new and useful ideas in her blonde head.\n\nMary had seen so much of the world that she was unusually lively for\nan English girl; while her various accomplishments made her a most\nagreeable companion. Much good sense gave her ballast; and the late\nexperiences of danger and happiness added a sweet gravity at times,\nwhich contrasted well with her natural gaiety. Mrs Jo was quite\nsatisfied with Emil's choice, and felt sure this true and tender pilot\nwould bring him safe to port through fair or stormy weather. She had\nfeared that Franz would settle down into a comfortable, moneymaking\nburgher, and be content with that; but she soon saw that his love of\nmusic and his placid Ludmilla put much poetry into his busy life, and\nkept it from being too prosaic. So she felt at rest about these boys,\nand enjoyed their visit with real, maternal satisfaction; parting with\nthem in September most regretfully, yet hopefully, as they sailed away\nto the new life that lay before them.\n\nDemi's engagement was confided to the immediate family only, as both\nwere pronounced too young to do anything but love and wait. They were\nso happy that time seemed to stand still for them, and after a blissful\nweek they parted bravely--Alice to home duties, with a hope that\nsustained and cheered her through many trials; and John to his business,\nfull of a new ardour which made all things possible when such a reward\nwas offered.\n\nDaisy rejoiced over them, and was never tired of hearing her brother's\nplans for the future. Her own hope soon made her what she used to be--a\ncheery, busy creature, with a smile, kind word, and helping hand for\nall; and as she went singing about the house again, her mother felt that\nthe right remedy for past sadness had been found. The dear Pelican still\nhad doubts and fears, but kept them wisely to herself, preparing sundry\nsearching tests to be applied when Nat came home, and keeping a sharp\neye on the letters from London; for some mysterious hint had flown\nacross the sea, and Daisy's content seemed reflected in Nat's present\ncheerful state of mind.\n\nHaving passed through the Werther period, and tried a little Faust--of\nwhich experience he spoke to his Marguerite as if it had included\nan acquaintance with Mephistopheles, Blocksburg, and Auerbach's\nwine-cellar--he now felt that he was a Wilhelm Meister, serving his\napprenticeship to the great masters of life. As she knew the truth of\nhis small sins and honest repentance, Daisy only smiled at the mixture\nof love and philosophy he sent her, knowing that it was impossible for a\nyoung man to live in Germany without catching the German spirit.\n\n'His heart is all right; and his head will soon grow clear when he gets\nout of the fog of tobacco, beer, and metaphysics he's been living in.\nEngland will wake up his common sense, and good salt air blow his little\nfollies all away,' said Mrs Jo, much pleased with the good prospects\nof her violinist--whose return was delayed till spring, to his private\nregret, but professional advancement.\n\nJosie had a month with Miss Cameron at the seaside, and threw herself\nso heartily into the lesson given her that her energy, promise, and\npatience laid the foundation of a friendship which was of infinite value\nto her in the busy, brilliant years to come; for little Jo's instincts\nwere right; and the dramatic talent of the Marches was to blossom by and\nby into an actress, virtuous, and beloved.\n\nTom and his Dora were peacefully ambling altar-ward; for Bangs senior\nwas so afraid his son would change his mind again and try a third\nprofession, that he gladly consented to an early marriage, as a sort\nof anchor to hold the mercurial Thomas fast. Aforesaid Thomas could not\ncomplain of cold shoulders now; for Dora was a most devoted and adoring\nlittle mate, and made life so pleasant to him that his gift for getting\ninto scrapes seemed lost, and he bade fair to become a thriving man,\nwith undeniable talent for the business he had chosen.\n\n'We shall be married in the autumn, and live with my father for a while.\nThe governor is getting on, you know, and my wife and I must look after\nhim. Later we shall have an establishment of our own,' was a favourite\nspeech of his about this time, and usually received with smiles; for the\nidea of Tommy Bangs at the head of an 'establishment' was irresistibly\nfunny to all who knew him.\n\nThings were in this flourishing condition, and Mrs Jo was beginning to\nthink her trials were over for that year, when a new excitement came.\nSeveral postal cards had arrived at long intervals from Dan, who gave\nthem 'Care of M. Mason, etc.', as his address. By this means he was\nable to gratify his longing for home news, and to send brief messages to\nquiet their surprise at his delay in settling. The last one, which came\nin September, was dated 'Montana', and simply said:\n\nHere at last, trying mining again; but not going to stay long. All sorts\nof luck. Gave up the farm idea. Tell plans soon. Well, busy, and very\nhappy. D. K.\n\nIf they had known what the heavy dash under 'happy' meant, that postal\nwould have been a very eloquent bit of pasteboard; for Dan was free,\nand had gone straight away to the liberty he panted for. Meeting an old\nfriend by accident, he obliged him at a pinch by acting as overseer\nfor a time, finding the society even of rough miners very sweet, and\nsomething in the muscular work wonderfully pleasant, after being cooped\nup in the brush-shop so long. He loved to take a pick and wrestle with\nrock and earth till he was weary--which was very soon; for that year of\ncaptivity had told upon his splendid physique. He longed to go home, but\nwaited week after week to get the prison taint off him and the haggard\nlook out of his face. Meanwhile he made friends of masters and men;\nand as no one knew his story, he took his place again in the world\ngratefully and gladly--with little pride now, and no plans but to do\nsome good somewhere, and efface the past.\n\nMrs Jo was having a grand clearing-out of her desk one October day,\nwhile the rain poured outside, and peace reigned in her mansion. Coming\nacross the postals, she pondered over them, and then put them carefully\naway in the drawer labelled 'Boys' Letters', saying to herself, as she\nbundled eleven requests for autographs into the waste-paper basket:\n\n'It is quite time for another card, unless he is coming to tell his\nplans. I'm really curious to know what he has been about all this year,\nand how he's getting on now.'\n\nThat last wish was granted within an hour; for Ted came rushing in, with\na newspaper in one hand, a collapsed umbrella in the other, and a face\nfull of excitement, announcing, all in one breathless jumble:\n\n'Mine caved in--twenty men shut up--no way out--wives crying--water\nrising--Dan knew the old shaft--risked his life--got 'em out--most\nkilled--papers full of it--I knew he'd be a hero--hurray for old Dan!'\n\n'What? Where? When? Who? Stop roaring, and let me read!' commanded his\nmother, entirely bewildered.\n\nRelinquishing the paper, Ted allowed her to read for herself, with\nfrequent interruptions from him--and Rob, who soon followed, eager\nfor the tale. It was nothing new; but courage and devotion always stir\ngenerous hearts, and win admiration; so the account was both graphic and\nenthusiastic; and the name of Daniel Kean, the brave man who saved the\nlives of others at the risk of his own, was on many lips that day. Very\nproud were the faces of these friends as they read how their Dan was\nthe only one who, in the first panic of the accident, remembered the old\nshaft that led into the mine--walled up, but the only hope of escape,\nif the men could be got out before the rising water drowned them; how he\nwas lowered down alone, telling the others to keep back till he saw if\nit was safe; how he heard the poor fellows picking desperately for their\nlives on the other side, and by knocks and calls guided them to the\nright spot; then headed the rescue party, and working like a hero, got\nthe men out in time. On being drawn up last of all, the worn rope broke,\nand he had a terrible fall, being much hurt, but was still alive. How\nthe grateful women kissed his blackened face and bloody hands, as the\nmen bore him away in triumph, and the owners of the mine promised a\nhandsome reward, if he lived to receive it!\n\n'He must live; he shall, and come home to be nursed as soon as he can\nstir, if I go and bring him myself! I always knew he'd do something fine\nand brave, if he didn't get shot or hung for some wild prank instead,'\ncried Mrs Jo, much excited.\n\n'Do go, and take me with you, Mum. I ought to be the one, Dan's so fond\nof me and I of him,' began Ted, feeling that this would be an expedition\nafter his own heart.\n\nBefore his mother could reply, Mr Laurie came in, with almost as much\nnoise and flurry as Teddy the second, exclaiming as he waved the evening\npaper:\n\n'Seen the news, Jo? What do you think? Shall I go off at once, and see\nafter that brave boy?'\n\n'I wish you would. But the thing may not be all true--rumour lies so.\nPerhaps a few hours will bring an entirely new version of the story.'\n\n'I've telephoned to Demi for all he can find out; and if it's true, I'll\ngo at once. Should like the trip. If he's able, I'll bring him home; if\nnot, I'll stay and see to him. He'll pull through. Dan will never die of\na fall on his head. He's got nine lives, and not lost half of them yet.'\n\n'If you go, uncle, mayn't I go with you? I'm just spoiling for a\njourney; and it would be such larks to go out there with you, and see\nthe mines and Dan, and hear all about it, and help. I can nurse. Can't\nI, Rob?' cried Teddy, in his most wheedlesome tones.\n\n'Pretty well. But if mother can't spare you, I'm ready if uncle needs\nanyone,' answered Rob, in his quiet way, looking much fitter for the\ntrip than excitable Ted.\n\n'I can't spare either of you. My boys get into trouble, unless I keep\nthem close at home. I've no right to hold the others; but I won't let\nyou out of my sight, or something will happen. Never saw such a year,\nwith wrecks and weddings and floods and engagements, and every sort of\ncatastrophe!' exclaimed Mrs Jo.\n\n'If you deal in girls and boys, you must expect this sort of thing,\nma'am. The worst is over, I hope, till these lads begin to go off. Then\nI'll stand by you; for you'll need every kind of support and comfort,\nspecially if Ted bolts early,' laughed Mr Laurie, enjoying her\nlamentations.\n\n'I don't think anything can surprise me now; but I am anxious about\nDan, and feel that someone had better go to him. It's a rough place out\nthere, and he may need careful nursing. Poor lad, he seems to get a good\nmany hard knocks! But perhaps he needs them as \"a mellerin' process\", as\nHannah used to say.'\n\n'We shall hear from Demi before long, and then I'll be off.' With which\ncheerful promise Mr Laurie departed; and Ted, finding his mother firm,\nsoon followed, to coax his uncle to take him.\n\nFurther inquiry confirmed and added interest to the news. Mr Laurie was\noff at once; and Ted went into town with him, still vainly imploring to\nbe taken to his Dan. He was absent all day; but his mother said, calmly:\n\n'Only a fit of the sulks because he is thwarted. He's safe with Tom or\nDemi, and will come home hungry and meek at night. I know him.'\n\nBut she soon found that she could still be surprised; for evening\nbrought no Ted, and no one had seen him. Mr Bhaer was just setting\noff to find his lost son, when a telegram arrived, dated at one of the\nway-stations on Mr Laurie's route:\n\n    Found Ted in the cars. Take him along. Write tomorrow.\n\n        T.  LAURENCE\n\n'Ted bolted sooner than you expected, mother. Never mind--uncle will\ntake good care of him, and Dan be very glad to see him,' said Rob, as\nMrs Jo sat, trying to realize that her youngest was actually on his way\nto the wild West.\n\n'Disobedient boy! He shall be severely punished, if I ever get him\nagain. Laurie winked at this prank; I know he did. Just like him.\nWon't the two rascals have a splendid time? Wish I was with them! Don't\nbelieve that crazy boy took even a night-gown with him, or an overcoat.\nWell, there will be two patients for us to nurse when they get back, if\nthey ever do. Those reckless express trains always go down precipices,\nand burn up, or telescope. Oh! my Ted, my precious boy, how can I let\nhim go so far away from me?'\n\nAnd mother-like, Mrs Jo forgot the threatened chastisement in tender\nlamentations over the happy scapegrace, now whizzing across the\ncontinent in high feather at the success of his first revolt. Mr Laurie\nwas much amused at his insisting that those words, 'when Ted bolts', put\nthe idea into his head; and therefore the responsibility rested upon his\nshoulders. He assumed it kindly from the moment he came upon the runaway\nasleep in a car, with no visible luggage but a bottle of wine for Dan\nand a blacking-brush for himself; and as Mrs Jo suspected, the 'two\nrascals' did have a splendid time. Penitent letters arrived in due\nseason, and the irate parents soon forgot to chide in their anxiety\nabout Dan, who was very ill, and did not know his friends for several\ndays. Then he began to mend; and everyone forgave the bad boy when he\nproudly reported that the first conscious words Dan said were: 'Hallo,\nTed!' with a smile of pleasure at seeing a familiar face bent over him.\n\n'Glad he went, and I won't scold any more. Now, what shall we put in the\nbox for Dan?' And Mrs Jo worked off her impatience to get hold of the\ninvalid by sending comforts enough for a hospital.\n\nCheering accounts soon began to come, and at length Dan was pronounced\nable to travel, but seemed in no haste to go home, though never tired of\nhearing his nurses talk of it.\n\n'Dan is strangely altered,' wrote Laurie to Jo; 'not by this illness\nalone, but by something which has evidently gone before. I don't know\nwhat, and leave you to ask; but from his ravings when delirious I fear\nhe has been in some serious trouble the past year. He seems ten years\nolder, but improved, quieter, and so grateful to us. It is pathetic to\nsee the hunger in his eyes as they rest on Ted, as if he couldn't see\nenough of him. He says Kansas was a failure, but can't talk much; so I\nbide my time. The people here love him very much, and he cares for that\nsort of thing now; used to scorn any show of emotion, you know; now\nhe wants everyone to think well of him, and can't do enough to win\naffection and respect. I may be all wrong. You will soon find out. Ted\nis in clover, and the trip has done him a world of good. Let me take him\nto Europe when we go? Apron-strings don't agree with him any better than\nthey did with me when I proposed to run away to Washington with you some\ncentury ago. Aren't you sorry you didn't?'\n\nThis private letter set Mrs Jo's lively fancy in a ferment, and she\nimagined every known crime, affliction, and complication which could\npossibly have befallen Dan. He was too feeble to be worried with\nquestions now, but she promised herself most interesting revelations\nwhen she got him safe at home; for the 'firebrand' was her most\ninteresting boy. She begged him to come, and spent more time in\ncomposing a letter that should bring him, than she did over the most\nthrilling episodes in her 'works'.\n\nNo one but Dan saw the letter; but it did bring him, and one November\nday Mr Laurie helped a feeble man out of a carriage at the door of\nPlumfield, and Mother Bhaer received the wanderer like a recovered son;\nwhile Ted, in a disreputable-looking hat and an astonishing pair of\nboots, performed a sort of war-dance round the interesting group.\n\n'Right upstairs and rest; I'm nurse now, and this ghost must eat before\nhe talks to anyone,' commanded Mrs Jo, trying not to show how shocked\nshe was at this shorn and shaven, gaunt and pallid shadow of the\nstalwart man she parted with.\n\nHe was quite content to obey, and lay on the long lounge in the room\nprepared for him, looking about as tranquilly as a sick child restored\nto its own nursery and mother's arms, while his new nurse fed and\nrefreshed him, bravely controlling the questions that burned upon her\ntongue. Being weak and weary, he soon fell asleep; and then she stole\naway to enjoy the society of the 'rascals', whom she scolded and petted,\npumped and praised, to her heart's content.\n\n'Jo, I think Dan has committed some crime and suffered for it,' said Mr\nLaurie, when Ted had departed to show his boots and tell glowing tales\nof the dangers and delights of the miners' life to his mates. 'Some\nterrible experience has come to the lad, and broken his spirit. He was\nquite out of his head when we arrived, and I took the watching, so I\nheard more of those sad wanderings than anyone else. He talked of the\n\"warden\", some trail, a dead man, and Blair and Mason, and would keep\noffering me his hand, asking me if I would take it and forgive him.\nOnce, when he was very wild, I held his arms, and he quieted in a\nmoment, imploring me not to \"put the handcuffs on\". I declare, it was\nquite awful sometimes to hear him in the night talk of old Plum and you,\nand beg to be let out and go home to die.'\n\n'He isn't going to die, but live to repent of anything he may have done;\nso don't harrow me up with these dark hints, Teddy. I don't care if he's\nbroken the Ten Commandments, I'll stand by him, and so will you, and\nwe'll set him on his feet and make a good man of him yet. I know he's\nnot spoilt, by the look in his poor face. Don't say a word to anyone,\nand I'll have the truth before long,' answered Mrs Jo, still loyal to\nher bad boy, though much afflicted by what she had heard.\n\nFor some days Dan rested, and saw few people; then good care, cheerful\nsurroundings, and the comfort of being at home began to tell, and\nhe seemed more like himself, though still very silent as to his late\nexperiences, pleading the doctor's orders not to talk much. Everyone\nwanted to see him; but he shrank from any but old friends, and 'wouldn't\nlionize worth a cent', Ted said, much disappointed that he could not\nshow off his brave Dan.\n\n'Wasn't a man there who wouldn't have done the same, so why make a row\nover me?' asked the hero, feeling more ashamed than proud of the broken\narm, which looked so interesting in a sling.\n\n'But isn't it pleasant to think that you saved twenty lives, Dan, and\ngave husbands, sons, and fathers back to the women who loved them?'\nasked Mrs Jo one evening as they were alone together after several\ncallers had been sent away.\n\n'Pleasant! it's all that kept me alive, I do believe; yes, I'd rather\nhave done it than be made president or any other big bug in the world.\nNo one knows what a comfort it is to think I've saved twenty men to more\nthan pay for--' There Dan stopped short, having evidently spoken out of\nsome strong emotion to which his hearer had no key.\n\n'I thought you'd feel so. It is a splendid thing to save life at the\nrisk of one's own, as you did, and nearly lose it,' began Mrs Jo,\nwishing he had gone on with that impulsive speech which was so like his\nold manner.\n\n'\"He that loseth his life shall gain it\",' muttered Dan, staring at the\ncheerful fire which lighted the room, and shone on his thin face with a\nruddy glow.\n\nMrs Jo was so startled at hearing such words from his lips that she\nexclaimed joyfully:\n\n'Then you did read the little book I gave you, and kept your promise?'\n\n'I read it a good deal after a while. I don't know much yet, but I'm\nready to learn; and that's something.'\n\n'It's everything. Oh, my dear, tell me about it! I know something lies\nheavy on your heart; let me help you bear it, and so make the burden\nlighter.'\n\n'I know it would; I want to tell; but some things even you couldn't\nforgive; and if you let go of me, I'm afraid I can't keep afloat.'\n\n'Mothers can forgive anything! Tell me all, and be sure that I will\nnever let you go, though the whole world should turn from you.'\n\nMrs Jo took one of the big wasted hands in both of hers and held it\nfast, waiting silently till that sustaining touch warmed poor Dan's\nheart, and gave him courage to speak. Sitting in his old attitude, with\nhis head in his hands, he slowly told it all, never once looking up till\nthe last words left his lips.\n\n'Now you know; can you forgive a murderer, and keep a jail-bird in your\nhouse?'\n\nHer only answer was to put her arms about him, and lay the shorn head on\nher breast, with eyes so full of tears they could but dimly see the hope\nand fear that made his own so tragical.\n\nThat was better than any words; and poor Dan clung to her in speechless\ngratitude, feeling the blessedness of mother love--that divine gift\nwhich comforts, purifies, and strengthens all who seek it. Two or three\ngreat, bitter drops were hidden in the little woollen shawl where Dan's\ncheek rested, and no one ever knew how soft and comfortable it felt to\nhim after the hard pillows he had known so long. Suffering of both mind\nand body had broken will and pride, and the lifted burden brought such a\nsense of relief that he paused a moment to enjoy it in dumb delight.\n\n'My poor boy, how you have suffered all this year, when we thought you\nfree as air! Why didn't you tell us, Dan, and let us help you? Did you\ndoubt your friends?' asked Mrs Jo, forgetting all other emotions in\nsympathy, as she lifted up the hidden face, and looked reproachfully\ninto the great hollow eyes that met her own frankly now.\n\n'I was ashamed. I tried to bear it alone rather than shock and\ndisappoint you, as I know I have, though you try not to show it. Don't\nmind; I must get used to it'; and Dan's eyes dropped again as if they\ncould not bear to see the trouble and dismay his confession painted on\nhis best friend's face.\n\n'I am shocked and disappointed by the sin, but I am also very glad and\nproud and grateful that my sinner has repented, atoned, and is ready to\nprofit by the bitter lesson. No one but Fritz and Laurie need ever know\nthe truth; we owe it to them, and they will feel as I do,' answered Mrs\nJo, wisely thinking that entire frankness would be a better tonic than\ntoo much sympathy.\n\n'No, they won't; men never forgive like women. But it's right. Please\ntell 'em for me, and get it over. Mr Laurence knows it, I guess. I\nblabbed when my wits were gone; but he was very kind all the same. I can\nbear their knowing; but oh, not Ted and the girls!' Dan clutched her\narm with such an imploring face that she hastened to assure him no one\nshould know except the two old friends, and he calmed down as if ashamed\nof his sudden panic.\n\n'It wasn't murder, mind you, it was in self-defence; he drew first, and\nI had to hit him. Didn't mean to kill him; but it doesn't worry me as\nmuch as it ought, I'm afraid. I've more than paid for it, and such a\nrascal is better out of the world than in it, showing boys the way to\nhell. Yes, I know you think that's awful in me; but I can't help it. I\nhate a scamp as I do a skulking coyote, and always want to get a shot at\n'em. Perhaps it would have been better if he had killed me; my life is\nspoilt.'\n\nAll the old prison gloom seemed to settle like a black cloud on Dan's\nface as he spoke, and Mrs Jo was frightened at the glimpse it gave her\nof the fire through which he had passed to come out alive, but\nscarred for life. Hoping to turn his mind to happier things, she said\ncheerfully:\n\n'No, it isn't; you have learned to value it more and use it better\nfor this trial. It is not a lost year, but one that may prove the most\nhelpful of any you ever know. Try to think so, and begin again; we will\nhelp, and have all the more confidence in you for this failure. We all\ndo the same and struggle on.'\n\n'I never can be what I was. I feel about sixty, and don't care for\nanything now I've got here. Let me stay till I'm on my legs, then I'll\nclear out and never trouble you any more,' said Dan despondently.\n\n'You are weak and low in your mind; that will pass, and by and by you\nwill go to your missionary work among the Indians with all the old\nenergy and the new patience, self-control, and knowledge you have\ngained. Tell me more about that good chaplain and Mary Mason and the\nlady whose chance word helped you so much. I want to know all about the\ntrials of my poor boy.'\n\nWon by her tender interest, Dan brightened up and talked on till he had\npoured out all the story of that bitter year, and felt better for the\nload he lifted off.\n\nIf he had known how it weighed upon his hearer's heart, he would have\nheld his peace; but she hid her sorrow till she had sent him to bed,\ncomforted and calm; then she cried her heart out, to the great dismay\nof Fritz and Laurie, till they heard the tale and could mourn with her;\nafter which they all cheered up and took counsel together how best to\nhelp this worst of all the 'catastrophes' the year had brought them.\n\n\n\nChapter 21. ASLAUGA'S KNIGHT\n\nIt was curious to see the change which came over Dan after that talk. A\nweight seemed off his mind; and though the old impetuous spirit flashed\nout at times, he seemed intent on trying to show his gratitude and love\nand honour to these true friends by a new humility and confidence very\nsweet to them, very helpful to him. After hearing the story from Mrs\nJo, the Professor and Mr Laurie made no allusion to it beyond the hearty\nhand-grasp, the look of compassion, the brief word of good cheer in\nwhich men convey sympathy, and a redoubled kindness which left no doubt\nof pardon. Mr Laurie began at once to interest influential persons\nin Dan's mission, and set in motion the machinery which needs so much\noiling before anything can be done where Government is concerned.\nMr Bhaer, with the skill of a true teacher, gave Dan's hungry mind\nsomething to do, and helped him understand himself by carrying on the\ngood chaplain's task so paternally that the poor fellow often said he\nfelt as if he had found a father. The boys took him to drive, and amused\nhim with their pranks and plans; while the women, old and young, nursed\nand petted him till he felt like a sultan with a crowd of devoted\nslaves, obedient to his lightest wish. A very little of this was enough\nfor Dan, who had a masculine horror of 'molly-coddling', and so brief an\nacquaintance with illness that he rebelled against the doctor's orders\nto keep quiet; and it took all Mrs Jo's authority and the girls'\ningenuity to keep him from leaving his sofa long before strained back\nand wounded head were well. Daisy cooked for him; Nan attended to his\nmedicines; Josie read aloud to while away the long hours of inaction\nthat hung so heavily on his hands; while Bess brought all her\npictures and casts to amuse him, and, at his special desire, set up a\nmodelling-stand in his parlour and began to mould the buffalo head he\ngave her. Those afternoons seemed the pleasantest part of his day; and\nMrs Jo, busy in her study close by, could see the friendly trio and\nenjoy the pretty pictures they made. The girls were much flattered\nby the success of their efforts, and exerted themselves to be very\nentertaining, consulting Dan's moods with the feminine tact most women\ncreatures learn before they are out of pinafores. When he was gay, the\nroom rang with laughter; when gloomy, they read or worked in respectful\nsilence till their sweet patience cheered him up again; and when in pain\nthey hovered over him like 'a couple of angels', as he said. He often\ncalled Josie 'little mother', but Bess was always 'Princess'; and his\nmanner to the two cousins was quite different. Josie sometimes fretted\nhim with her fussy ways, the long plays she liked to read, and the\nmaternal scoldings she administered when he broke the rules; for having\na lord of creation in her power was so delightful to her that she would\nhave ruled him with a rod of iron if he had submitted. To Bess, in her\ngentler ministrations, he never showed either impatience or weariness,\nbut obeyed her least word, exerted himself to seem well in her presence,\nand took such interest in her work that he lay looking at her with\nunwearied eyes; while Josie read to him in her best style unheeded.\n\nMrs Jo observed this, and called them 'Una and the Lion', which suited\nthem very well, though the lion's mane was shorn, and Una never tried to\nbridle him. The elder ladies did their part in providing delicacies and\nsupplying all his wants; but Mrs Meg was busy at home, Mrs Amy preparing\nfor the trip to Europe in the spring, and Mrs Jo hovering on the brink\nof a 'vortex'--for the forthcoming book had been sadly delayed by\nthe late domestic events. As she sat at her desk, settling papers or\nmeditatively nibbling her pen while waiting for the divine afflatus to\ndescend upon her, she often forgot her fictitious heroes and heroines\nin studying the live models before her, and thus by chance looks, words,\nand gestures discovered a little romance unsuspected by anyone else.\n\nThe portiere between the rooms was usually drawn aside, giving a view of\nthe group in the large bay-window--Bess at one side, in her grey blouse,\nbusy with her tools; Josie at the other side with her book; and between,\non the long couch, propped with many cushions, lay Dan in a many-hued\neastern dressing-gown presented by Mr Laurie and worn to please\nthe girls, though the invalid much preferred an old jacket 'with no\nconfounded tail to bother over'. He faced Mrs Jo's room, but never\nseemed to see her, for his eyes were on the slender figure before him,\nwith the pale winter sunshine touching her golden head, and the delicate\nhands that shaped the clay so deftly. Josie was just visible, rocking\nviolently in a little chair at the head of the couch, and the steady\nmurmur of her girlish voice was usually the only sound that broke the\nquiet of the room, unless a sudden discussion arose about the book or\nthe buffalo.\n\nSomething in the big eyes, bigger and blacker than ever in the thin\nwhite face, fixed, so steadily on one object, had a sort of fascination\nfor Mrs Jo after a time, and she watched the changes in them curiously;\nfor Dan's mind was evidently not on the story, and he often forgot to\nlaugh or exclaim at the comic or exciting crises. Sometimes they were\nsoft and wistful, and the watcher was very glad that neither damsel\ncaught that dangerous look for when they spoke it vanished; sometimes\nit was full of eager fire, and the colour came and went rebelliously,\nin spite of his attempt to hide it with an impatient gesture of hand or\nhead; but oftenest it was dark, and sad, and stern, as if those gloomy\neyes looked out of captivity at some forbidden light or joy. This\nexpression came so often that it worried Mrs Jo, and she longed to go\nand ask him what bitter memory overshadowed those quiet hours. She knew\nthat his crime and its punishment must lie heavy on his mind; but youth,\nand time, and new hopes would bring comfort, and help to wear away\nthe first sharpness of the prison brand. It lifted at other times, and\nseemed almost forgotten when he joked with the boys, talked with old\nfriends, or enjoyed the first snows as he drove out every fair day. Why\nshould the shadow always fall so darkly on him in the society of these\ninnocent and friendly girls? They never seemed to see it, and if either\nlooked or spoke, a quick smile came like a sunburst through the clouds\nto answer them. So Mrs Jo went on watching, wondering, and discovering,\ntill accident confirmed her fears.\n\nJosie was called away one day, and Bess, tired of working, offered to\ntake her place if he cared for more reading.\n\n'I do; your reading suits me better than Jo's. She goes so fast my\nstupid head gets in a muddle and soon begins to ache. Don't tell her;\nshe's a dear little soul, and so good to sit here with a bear like me.'\n\nThe smile was ready as Bess went to the table for a new book, the last\nstory being finished.\n\n'You are not a bear, but very good and patient, we think. It is always\nhard for a man to be shut up, mamma says, and must be terrible for you,\nwho have always been so free.'\n\nIf Bess had not been reading titles she would have seen Dan shrink as\nif her last words hurt him. He made no answer; but other eyes saw and\nunderstood why he looked as if he would have liked to spring up and rush\naway for one of his long races up the hill, as he used to do when the\nlonging for liberty grew uncontrollable. Moved by a sudden impulse, Mrs\nJo caught up her work-basket and went to join her neighbours, feeling\nthat a non-conductor might be needed; for Dan looked like a thundercloud\nfull of electricity.\n\n'What shall we read, Aunty? Dan doesn't seem to care. You know his\ntaste; tell me something quiet and pleasant and short. Josie will\nbe back soon,' said Bess, still turning over the books piled on the\ncentre-table.\n\nBefore Mrs Jo could answer, Dan pulled a shabby little volume from under\nhis pillow, and handing it to her said: 'Please read the third one; it's\nshort and pretty--I'm fond of it.' The book opened at the right place,\nas if the third story had been often read, and Bess smiled as she saw\nthe name.\n\n'Why, Dan, I shouldn't think you'd care for this romantic German tale.\nThere is fighting in it; but it is very sentimental, if I remember\nrightly.'\n\n'I know it; but I've read so few stories, I like the simple ones best.\nHad nothing else to read sometimes; I guess I know it all by heart, and\nnever seem to be tired of those fighting fellows, and the fiends and\nangels and lovely ladies. You read \"Aslauga's Knight\", and see if you\ndon't like it. Edwald was rather too soft for my fancy; but Froda was\nfirst-rate and the spirit with the golden hair always reminded me of\nyou.'\n\nAs Dan spoke Mrs Jo settled herself where she could watch him in the\nglass, and Bess took a large chair facing him, saying, as she put up her\nhands to retie the ribbon that held the cluster of thick, soft curls at\nthe back of her head:\n\n'I hope Aslauga's hair wasn't as troublesome as mine, for it's always\ntumbling down. I'll be ready in a minute.'\n\n'Don't tie it up; please let it hang. I love to see it shine that way.\nIt will rest your head, and be just right for the story, Goldilocks,'\npleaded Dan, using the childish name and looking more like his boyish\nself than he had done for many a day.\n\nBess laughed, shook down her pretty hair, and began to read, glad to\nhide her face a little; for compliments made her shy, no matter who paid\nthem. Dan listened intently on; and Mrs Jo, with eyes that went often\nfrom her needle to the glass, could see, without turning, how he\nenjoyed every word as if it had more meaning for him than for the other\nlisteners. His face brightened wonderfully, and soon wore the look that\ncame when anything brave or beautiful inspired and touched his better\nself. It was Fouque's charming story of the knight Froda, and the fair\ndaughter of Sigurd, who was a sort of spirit, appearing to her lover in\nhours of danger and trial, as well as triumph and joy, till she became\nhis guide and guard, inspiring him with courage, nobleness, and truth,\nleading him to great deeds in the field, sacrifices for those he loved,\nand victories over himself by the gleaming of her golden hair, which\nshone on him in battle, dreams, and perils by day and night, till after\ndeath he finds the lovely spirit waiting to receive and to reward him.\n\nOf all the stories in the book this was the last one would have supposed\nDan would like best, and even Mrs Jo was surprised at his perceiving the\nmoral of the tale through the delicate imagery and romantic language by\nwhich it was illustrated. But as she looked and listened she remembered\nthe streak of sentiment and refinement which lay concealed in Dan like\nthe gold vein in a rock, making him quick to feel and to enjoy fine\ncolour in a flower, grace in an animal, sweetness in women, heroism in\nmen, and all the tender ties that bind heart to heart; though he was\nslow to show it, having no words to express the tastes and instincts\nwhich he inherited from his mother. Suffering of soul and body had\ntamed his stronger passions, and the atmosphere of love and pity now\nsurrounding him purified and warmed his heart till it began to hunger\nfor the food neglected or denied so long. This was plainly written in\nhis too expressive face, as, fancying it unseen, he let it tell the\nlonging after beauty, peace, and happiness embodied for him in the\ninnocent fair girl before him.\n\nThe conviction of this sad yet natural fact came to Mrs Jo with a pang,\nfor she felt how utterly hopeless such a longing was; since light and\ndarkness were not farther apart than snow-white Bess and sin-stained\nDan. No dream of such a thing disturbed the young girl, as her entire\nunconsciousness plainly showed. But how long would it be before the\neloquent eyes betrayed the truth? And then what disappointment for\nDan, what dismay for Bess, who was as cool and high and pure as her own\nmarbles, and shunned all thought of love with maidenly reserve.\n\n'How hard everything is made for my poor boy! How can I spoil his little\ndream, and take away the spirit of good he is beginning to love and long\nfor? When my own dear lads are safely settled I'll never try another,\nfor these things are heart-breaking, and I can't manage any more,'\nthought Mrs Jo, as she put the lining into Teddy's coat-sleeve upside\ndown, so perplexed and grieved was she at this new catastrophe.\n\nThe story was soon done, and as Bess shook back her hair, Dan asked as\neagerly as a boy:\n\n'Don't you like it?'\n\n'Yes, it's very pretty, and I see the meaning of it; but Undine was\nalways my favourite.'\n\n'Of course, that's like you--lilies and pearls and souls and pure\nwater. Sintram used to be mine; but I took a fancy to this when I\nwas--ahem--rather down on my luck one time, and it did me good, it was\nso cheerful and sort of spiritual in its meaning, you know.'\n\nBess opened her blue eyes in wonder at this fancy of Dan's for anything\n'spiritual'; but she only nodded, saying: 'Some of the little songs are\nsweet and might be set to music.'\n\nDan laughed; 'I used to sing the last one to a tune of my own sometimes\nat sunset:\n\n    '\"Listening to celestial lays,\n      Bending thy unclouded gaze\n      On the pure and living light,\n      Thou art blest, Aslauga's Knight!\"\n\n'And I was,' he added, under his breath, as he glanced towards the\nsunshine dancing on the wall.\n\n'This one suits you better now'; and glad to please him by her interest,\nBess read in her soft voice:\n\n    '\"Healfast, healfast, ye hero wounds;\n      O knight, be quickly strong!\n      Beloved strife\n      For fame and life,\n      Oh, tarry not too long!\"'\n\n'I'm no hero, never can be, and \"fame and life\" can't do much for me.\nNever mind, read me that paper, please. This knock on the head has made\na regular fool of me.'\n\nDan's voice was gentle; but the light was gone out of his face now, and\nhe moved restlessly as if the silken pillows were full of thorns. Seeing\nthat his mood had changed, Bess quietly put down the book, took up the\npaper, and glanced along the columns for something to suit him.\n\n'You don't care for the money market, I know, nor musical news. Here's\na murder; you used to like those; shall I read it? One man kills\nanother--,'\n\n'No!'\n\nOnly a word, but it gave Mrs Jo a thrill, and for a moment she dared not\nglance at the tell-tale mirror. When she did Dan lay motionless with one\nhand over his eyes, and Bess was happily reading the art news to ears\nthat never heard a word. Feeling like a thief who has stolen something\nvery precious, Mrs Jo slipped away to her study, and before long Bess\nfollowed to report that Dan was fast asleep.\n\nSending her home, with the firm resolve to keep her there as much as\npossible, Mother Bhaer had an hour of serious thought all alone in the\nred sunset; and when a sound in the next room led her there, she found\nthat the feigned sleep had become real repose; for Dan lay breathing\nheavily, with a scarlet spot on either cheek, and one hand clinched on\nhis broad breast. Yearning over him with a deeper pity than ever before,\nshe sat in the little chair beside him, trying to see her way out of\nthis tangle, till his hand slipped down, and in doing so snapped a cord\nhe wore about his neck and let a small case drop to the floor.\n\nMrs Jo picked it up, and as he did not wake, sat looking at it, idly\nwondering what charm it held; for the case was of Indian workmanship and\nthe broken cord, of closely woven grass, sweet scented and pale yellow.\n\n'I won't pry into any more of the poor fellow's secrets. I'll mend and\nput it back, and never let him know I've seen his talisman.'\n\nAs she spoke she turned the little wallet to examine the fracture, and\na card fell into her lap. It was a photograph, cut to fit its covering,\nand two words were written underneath the face, 'My Aslauga'. For an\ninstant Mrs Jo fancied that it might be one of herself, for all the boys\nhad them; but as the thin paper fell away, she saw the picture Demi took\nof Bess that happy summer day. There was no doubt now, and with a sigh\nshe put it back, and was about to slip it into Dan's bosom so that not\neven a stitch should betray her knowledge, when as she leaned towards\nhim, she saw that he was looking straight at her with an expression that\nsurprised her more than any of the strange ones she had ever seen in\nthat changeful face before.\n\n'Your hand slipped down; it fell; I was putting it back,' explained Mrs\nJo, feeling like a naughty child caught in mischief.\n\n'You saw the picture?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'And know what a fool I am?'\n\n'Yes, Dan, and am so grieved--'\n\n'Don't worry about me. I'm all right--glad you know, though I never\nmeant to tell you. Of course it is only a crazy fancy of mine, and\nnothing can ever come of it. Never thought there would. Good Lord! what\ncould that little angel ever be to me but what she is--a sort of dream\nof all that's sweet and good?'\n\nMore afflicted by the quiet resignation of his look and tone than by\nthe most passionate ardour, Mrs Jo could only say, with a face full of\nsympathy:\n\n'It is very hard, dear, but there is no other way to look at it. You are\nwise and brave enough to see that, and to let the secret be ours alone.'\n\n'I swear I will! not a word nor a look if I can help it. No one guesses,\nand if it troubles no one, is there any harm in my keeping this, and\ntaking comfort in the pretty fancy that kept me sane in that cursed\nplace?'\n\nDan's face was eager now, and he hid away the little worn case as if\ndefying any hand to take it from him. Anxious to know everything before\ngiving counsel or comfort, Mrs Jo said quietly:\n\n'Keep it, and tell me all about the \"fancy\". Since I have stumbled on\nyour secret, let me know how it came, and how I can help to make it\nlighter to bear.'\n\n'You'll laugh; but I don't mind. You always did find out our secrets and\ngive us a lift. Well, I never cared much for books, you know; but down\nyonder when the devil tormented me I had to do something or go stark\nmad, so I read both the books you gave me. One was beyond me, till that\ngood old man showed me how to read it; but the other, this one, was a\ncomfort, I tell you. It amused me, and was as pretty as poetry. I liked\n'em all, and most wore out Sintram. See how used up he is! Then I came\nto this, and it sort of fitted that other happy part of my life, last\nsummer--here.'\n\nDan stopped a moment as the words lingered on his lips; then, with a\nlong breath, went on, as if it was hard to lay bare the foolish little\nromance he had woven about a girl, a picture, and a child's story there\nin the darkness of the place which was as terrible to him as Dante's\nInferno, till he found his Beatrice.\n\n'I couldn't sleep, and had to think about something, so I used to fancy\nI was Folko, and see the shining of Aslauga's hair in the sunset on\nthe wall, the gum of the watchman's lamp, and the light that came in at\ndawn. My cell was high. I could see a bit of sky; sometimes there was\na star in it, and that was most as good as a face. I set great store by\nthat patch of blue, and when a white cloud went by, I thought it was the\nprettiest thing in all this world. I guess I was pretty near a fool; but\nthose thoughts and things helped me through, so they are all solemn true\nto me, and I can't let them go. The dear shiny head, the white gown, the\neyes like stars, and sweet, calm ways that set her as high above me as\nthe moon in heaven. Don't take it away! it's only a fancy, but a man\nmust love something, and I'd better love a spirit like her than any of\nthe poor common girls who would care for me.'\n\nThe quiet despair in Dan's voice pierced Mrs Jo to the heart; but there\nwas no hope and she gave none. Yet she felt that he was right, and that\nhis hapless affection might do more to uplift and purify him than any\nother he might know. Few women would care to marry Dan now, except such\nas would hinder, not help, him in the struggle which life would always\nbe to him; and it was better to go solitary to his grave than become\nwhat she suspected his father had been--a handsome, unprincipled, and\ndangerous man, with more than one broken heart to answer for.\n\n'Yes, Dan, it is wise to keep this innocent fancy, if it helps and\ncomforts you, till something more real and possible comes to make you\nhappier. I wish I could give you any hope; but we both know that the\ndear child is the apple of her father's eye, the pride of her mother's\nheart, and that the most perfect lover they can find will hardly seem to\nthem worthy of their precious daughter. Let her remain for you the high,\nbright star that leads you up and makes you believe in heaven.' Mrs Jo\nbroke down there; it seemed so cruel to destroy the faint hope Dan's\neyes betrayed, that she could not moralize when she thought of his hard\nlife and lonely future. Perhaps it was the wisest thing she could have\ndone, for in her hearty sympathy he found comfort for his own loss, and\nvery soon was able to speak again in the manly tone of resignation\nto the inevitable that showed how honest was his effort to give up\neverything but the pale shadow of what, for another, might have been a\nhappy possibility.\n\nThey talked long and earnestly in the twilight; and this second secret\nbound them closer than the first; for in it there was neither sin nor\nshame--only the tender pain and patience which has made saints and\nheroes of far worse men than our poor Dan. When at length they rose at\nthe summons of a bell, all the sunset glory had departed, and in the\nwintry sky there hung one star, large, soft, and clear, above a snowy\nworld. Pausing at the window before she dropped the curtains, Mrs Jo\nsaid cheerfully:\n\n'Come and see how beautiful the evening star is, since you love it so.'\nAnd as he stood behind her, tall and pale, like the ghost of his former\nself, she added softly: 'And remember, dear, if the sweet girl is denied\nyou, the old friend is always here--to love and trust and pray for you.'\n\nThis time she was not disappointed; and had she asked any reward for\nmany anxieties and cares, she received it when Dan's strong arm came\nround her, as he said, in a voice which showed her that she had not\nlaboured in vain to pluck her firebrand from the burning:\n\n'I never can forget that; for she's helped to save my soul, and make me\ndare to look up there and say:\n\n\"God bless her!\"'\n\n\n\nChapter 22. POSITIVELY LAST APPEARANCE\n\n'Upon my word, I feel as if I lived in a powder-magazine, and don't\nknow which barrel will explode next, and send me flying,' said Mrs Jo\nto herself next day, as she trudged up to Parnassus to suggest to her\nsister that perhaps the most charming of the young nurses had better\nreturn to her marble gods before she unconsciously added another wound\nto those already won by the human hero. She told no secrets; but a hint\nwas sufficient; for Mrs Amy guarded her daughter as a pearl of great\nprice, and at once devised a very simple means of escape from danger.\nMr Laurie was going to Washington on Dan's behalf, and was delighted to\ntake his family with him when the idea was carelessly suggested. So the\nconspiracy succeeded finely; and Mrs Jo went home, feeling more like a\ntraitor than ever. She expected an explosion; but Dan took the news so\nquietly, it was plain that he cherished no hope; and Mrs Amy was sure\nher romantic sister had been mistaken. If she had seen Dan's face when\nBess went to say good-bye, her maternal eye would have discovered far\nmore than the unconscious girl did. Mrs Jo trembled lest he should\nbetray himself; but he had learned self-control in a stern school, and\nwould have got through the hard moment bravely, only, when he took both\nhands, saying heartily:\n\n'Good-bye, Princess. If we don't meet again, remember your old friend\nDan sometimes,' she, touched by his late danger and the wistful look he\nwore, answered with unusual warmth: 'How can I help it, when you make us\nall so proud of you? God bless your mission, and bring you safely home\nto us again!'\n\nAs she looked up at him with a face full of frank affection and sweet\nregret, all that he was losing rose so vividly before him that Dan could\nnot resist the impulse to take the 'dear goldy head' between his hands\nand kiss it, with a broken 'Good-bye'; then hurried back to his room,\nfeeling as if it were the prison-cell again, with no glimpse of heaven's\nblue to comfort him.\n\nThis abrupt caress and departure rather startled Bess; for she felt with\na girl's quick instinct that there was something in that kiss unknown\nbefore, and looked after him with sudden colour in her cheeks and new\ntrouble in her eyes. Mrs Jo saw it, and fearing a very natural question\nanswered it before it was put.\n\n'Forgive him, Bess. He has had a great trouble, and it makes him tender\nat parting with old friends; for you know he may never come back from\nthe wild world he is going to.'\n\n'You mean the fall and danger of death?' asked Bess, innocently.\n\n'No, dear; a greater trouble than that. But I cannot tell you any\nmore--except that he has come through it bravely; so you may trust and\nrespect him, as I do.'\n\n'He has lost someone he loved. Poor Dan! We must be very kind to him.'\n\nBess did not ask the question, but seemed content with her solution of\nthe mystery--which was so true that Mrs Jo confirmed it by a nod, and\nlet her go away believing that some tender loss and sorrow wrought the\ngreat change all saw in Dan, and made him so slow to speak concerning\nthe past year.\n\nBut Ted was less easily satisfied, and this unusual reticence goaded\nhim to desperation. His mother had warned him not to trouble Dan with\nquestions till he was quite well; but this prospect of approaching\ndeparture made him resolve to have a full, clear, and satisfactory\naccount of the adventures which he felt sure must have been thrilling,\nfrom stray words Dan let fall in his fever. So one day when the coast\nwas clear, Master Ted volunteered to amuse the invalid, and did so in\nthe following manner:\n\n'Look here, old boy, if you don't want me to read, you've got to talk,\nand tell me all about Kansas, and the farms, and that part. The Montana\nbusiness I know, but you seem to forget what went before. Brace up, and\nlet's have it,' he began, with an abruptness which roused Dan from a\nbrown study most effectually.\n\n'No, I don't forget; it isn't interesting to anyone but myself. I didn't\nsee any farms--gave it up,' he said slowly.\n\n'Why?'\n\n'Other things to do.'\n\n'What?'\n\n'Well, brush-making for one thing.'\n\n'Don't chaff a fellow. Tell true.'\n\n'I truly did.'\n\n'What for?'\n\n'To keep out of mischief, as much as anything.'\n\n'Well, of all the queer things--and you've done a lot--that's the\nqueerest,' cried Ted, taken aback at this disappointing discovery. But\nhe didn't mean to give up yet, and began again.\n\n'What mischief, Dan?'\n\n'Never you mind. Boys shouldn't bother.'\n\n'But I do want to know, awfully, because I'm your pal, and care for you\nno end. Always did. Come, now, tell me a good yarn. I love scrapes. I'll\nbe mum as an oyster if you don't want it known.'\n\n'Will you?' and Dan looked at him, wondering how the boyish face would\nchange if the truth were suddenly told him.\n\n'I'll swear it on locked fists, if you like. I know it was jolly, and\nI'm aching to hear.'\n\n'You are as curious as a girl. More than some--Josie and--and Bess never\nasked a question.'\n\n'They don't care about rows and things; they liked the mine business,\nheroes, and that sort. So do I, and I'm as proud as Punch over it; but\nI see by your eyes that there was something else before that, and I'm\nbound to find out who Blair and Mason are, and who was hit and who ran\naway, and all the rest of it.'\n\n'What!' cried Dan, in a tone that made Ted jump.\n\n'Well, you used to mutter about 'em in your sleep, and Uncle Laurie\nwondered. So did I; but don't mind, if you can't remember, or would\nrather not.'\n\n'What else did I say? Queer, what stuff a man will talk when his wits\nare gone.'\n\n'That's all I heard; but it seemed interesting, and I just mentioned it,\nthinking it might refresh your memory a bit,' said Teddy, very politely;\nfor Dan's frown was heavy at that moment.\n\nIt cleared off at this reply, and after a look at the boy squirming with\nsuppressed impatience in his chair, Dan made up his mind to amuse him\nwith a game of cross-purposes and half-truths, hoping to quench his\ncuriosity, and so get peace.\n\n'Let me see; Blair was a lad I met in the cars, and Mason a poor fellow\nwho was in a--well, a sort of hospital where I happened to be. Blair ran\noff to his brothers, and I suppose I might say Mason was hit, because he\ndied there. Does that suit you?'\n\n'No, it doesn't. Why did Blair run? and who hit the other fellow? I'm\nsure there was a fight somewhere, wasn't there?'\n\n'Yes!\n\n'I guess I know what it was about.'\n\n'The devil, you do! Let's hear you guess. Must be amusing,' said Dan,\naffecting an ease he did not feel.\n\nCharmed to be allowed to free his mind, Ted at once unfolded the boyish\nsolution of the mystery which he had been cherishing, for he felt that\nthere was one somewhere.\n\n'You needn't say yes, if I guess right and you are under oath to keep\nsilent. I shall know by your face, and never tell. Now see if I'm not\nright. Out there they have wild doings, and it's my belief you were in\nsome of 'em. I don't mean robbing mails, and KluKluxing, and that sort\nof thing; but defending the settlers, or hanging some scamp, or even\nshooting a few, as a fellow must sometimes, in self-defence. Ah, ha!\nI've hit it, I see. Needn't speak; I know the flash of your old eye, and\nthe clench of your big fist.' And Ted pranced with satisfaction.\n\n'Drive on, smart boy, and don't lose the trail,' said Dan, finding a\ncurious sense of comfort in some of these random words, and longing, but\nnot daring, to confirm the true ones. He might have confessed the crime,\nbut not the punishment that followed, the sense of its disgrace was\nstill so strong upon him.\n\n'I knew I should get it; can't deceive me long,' began Ted, with such an\nair of pride Dan could not help a short laugh.\n\n'It's a relief, isn't it, to have it off your mind? Now, just confide in\nme and it's all safe, unless you've sworn not to tell.'\n\n'I have.'\n\n'Oh, well, then don't'; and Ted's face fell, but he was himself again\nin a moment and said, with the air of a man of the world: 'It's all\nright--I understand--honour binds--silence to death, etc. Glad you stood\nby your mate in the hospital. How many did you kill?'\n\n'Only one.'\n\n'Bad lot, of course?'\n\n'A damned rascal.'\n\n'Well, don't look so fierce; I've no objection. Wouldn't mind popping\nat some of those bloodthirsty blackguards myself. Had to dodge and keep\nquiet after it, I suppose.'\n\n'Pretty quiet for a long spell.'\n\n'Got off all right in the end, and headed for your mines and did that\njolly brave thing. Now, I call that decidedly interesting and capital.\nI'm glad to know it; but I won't blab.'\n\n'Mind you don't. Look here. Ted, if you'd killed a man, would it trouble\nyou--a bad one, I mean?'\n\nThe lad opened his mouth to say, 'Not a bit,' but checked that answer as\nif something in Dan's face made him change his mind. 'Well, if it was my\nduty in war or self-defence, I suppose I shouldn't; but if I'd pitched\ninto him in a rage, I guess I should be very sorry. Shouldn't wonder if\nhe sort of haunted me, and remorse gnawed me as it did Aram and those\nfellows. You don't mind, do you? It was a fair fight, wasn't it?'\n\n'Yes, I was in the right; but I wish I'd been out of it. Women don't see\nit that way, and look horrified at such things. Makes it hard; but it\ndon't matter.'\n\n'Don't tell 'em; then they can't worry,' said Ted, with the nod of one\nversed in the management of the sex.\n\n'Don't intend to. Mind you keep your notions to yourself, for some of\n'em are wide of the mark. Now you may read if you like'; and there the\ntalk ended; but Ted took great comfort in it, and looked as wise as an\nowl afterwards.\n\nA few quiet weeks followed, during which Dan chafed at the delay; and\nwhen at length word came that his credentials were ready, he was eager\nto be off, to forget a vain love in hard work, and live for others,\nsince he might not for himself.\n\nSo one wild March morning our Sintram rode away, with horse and hound,\nto face again the enemies who would have conquered him, but for Heaven's\nhelp and human pity.\n\n'Ah, me! it does seem as if life was made of partings, and they get\nharder as we go on,' sighed Mrs Jo, a week later, as she sat in the long\nparlour at Parnassus one evening, whither the family had gone to welcome\nthe travellers back.\n\n'And meetings too, dear; for here we are, and Nat is on his way at last.\nLook for the silver lining, as Marmee used to say, and be comforted,'\nanswered Mrs Amy, glad to be at home and find no wolves prowling near\nher sheepfold.\n\n'I've been so worried lately, I can't help croaking. I wonder what Dan\nthought at not seeing you again? It was wise; but he would have enjoyed\nanother look at home faces before he went into the wilderness,' said Mrs\nJo regretfully.\n\n'Much better so. We left notes and all we could think of that he might\nneed, and slipped away before he came. Bess really seemed relieved;\nI'm sure I was'; and Mrs Amy smoothed an anxious line out of her white\nforehead, as she smiled at her daughter, laughing happily among her\ncousins.\n\nMrs Jo shook her head as if the silver lining of that cloud was hard to\nfind; but she had no time to croak again, for just then Mr Laurie came\nin looking well pleased at something.\n\n'A new picture has arrived; face towards the music-room, good people,\nand tell me how you like it. I call it \"Only a fiddler\", after\nAndersen's story. What name will you give it?'\n\nAs he spoke he threw open the wide doors, and just beyond they saw a\nyoung man standing, with a beaming face, and a violin in his hand. There\nwas no doubt about the name to this picture, and with the cry 'Nat!\nNat!' there was a general uprising. But Daisy reached him first, and\nseemed to have lost her usual composure somewhere on the way, for she\nclung to him, sobbing with the shock of a surprise and joy too great for\nher to bear quietly. Everything was settled by that tearful and tender\nembrace, for, though Mrs Meg speedily detached her daughter, it was only\nto take her place; while Demi shook Nat's hand with brotherly warmth,\nand Josie danced round them like Macbeth's three witches in one,\nchanting in her most tragic tones:\n\n'Chirper thou wast; second violin thou art; first thou shalt be. Hail,\nall hail!'\n\nThis caused a laugh, and made things gay and comfortable at once. Then\nthe usual fire of questions and answers began, to be kept up briskly\nwhile the boys admired Nat's blond beard and foreign clothes, the girls\nhis improved appearance--for he was ruddy with good English beef\nand beer, and fresh with the sea-breezes which had blown him swiftly\nhome--and the older folk rejoiced over his prospects. Of course all\nwanted to hear him play; and when tongues tired, he gladly did his best\nfor them, surprising the most critical by his progress in music even\nmore than by the energy and self-possession which made a new man\nof bashful Nat. By and by when the violin--that most human of all\ninstruments--had sung to them the loveliest songs without words, he\nsaid, looking about him at these old friends with what Mr Bhaer called a\n'feeling-full' expression of happiness and content:\n\n'Now let me play something that you will all remember though you won't\nlove it as I do'; and standing in the attitude which Ole Bull has\nimmortalized, he played the street melody he gave them the first night\nhe came to Plumfield. They remembered it, and joined in the plaintive\nchorus, which fitly expressed his own emotions:\n\n    'Oh my heart is sad and weary\n     Everywhere I roam,\n     Longing for the old plantation\n     And for the old folks at home.'\n\n'Now I feel better,' said Mrs Jo, as they all trooped down the hill soon\nafter. 'Some of our boys are failures, but I think this one is going to\nbe a success, and patient Daisy a happy girl at last. Nat is your work,\nFritz, and I congratulate you heartily.'\n\n'Ach, we can but sow the seed and trust that it falls on good ground.\nI planted, perhaps, but you watched that the fowls of the air did not\ndevour it, and brother Laurie watered generously; so we will share the\nharvest among us, and be glad even for a small one, heart's-dearest.'\n\n'I thought the seed had fallen on very stony ground with my poor Dan;\nbut I shall not be surprised if he surpasses all the rest in the real\nsuccess of life, since there is more rejoicing over one repentant sinner\nthan many saints,' answered Mrs Jo, still clinging fast to her black\nsheep although a whole flock of white ones trotted happily before her.\n\nIt is a strong temptation to the weary historian to close the present\ntale with an earthquake which should engulf Plumfield and its environs\nso deeply in the bowels of the earth that no youthful Schliemann could\never find a vestige of it. But as that somewhat melodramatic conclusion\nmight shock my gentle readers, I will refrain, and forestall the usual\nquestion, 'How did they end?' by briefly stating that all the marriages\nturned out well. The boys prospered in their various callings; so did\nthe girls, for Bess and Josie won honours in their artistic careers, and\nin the course of time found worthy mates. Nan remained a busy, cheerful,\nindependent spinster, and dedicated her life to her suffering sisters\nand their children, in which true woman's work she found abiding\nhappiness. Dan never married, but lived, bravely and usefully, among his\nchosen people till he was shot defending them, and at last lay quietly\nasleep in the green wilderness he loved so well, with a lock of golden\nhair upon his breast, and a smile on his face which seemed to say that\nAslauga's Knight had fought his last fight and was at peace. Stuffy\nbecame an alderman, and died suddenly of apoplexy after a public dinner.\nDolly was a society man of mark till he lost his money, when he found\ncongenial employment in a fashionable tailoring establishment. Demi\nbecame a partner, and lived to see his name above the door, and Rob was\na professor at Laurence College; but Teddy eclipsed them all by becoming\nan eloquent and famous clergyman, to the great delight of his astonished\nmother. And now, having endeavoured to suit everyone by many weddings,\nfew deaths, and as much prosperity as the eternal fitness of things will\npermit, let the music stop, the lights die out, and the curtain fall for\never on the March family.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Jo's Boys, by Louisa May Alcott\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK JO'S BOYS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 3499.txt or 3499.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/3\/4\/9\/3499\/\n\nProduced by The Project Gutenberg Alcott Team\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":210,"split":"train"}
