{"ori_id":"8afdb338362e2cf594bb0cdf1f3aef8a982832ed","title":"Hannibal (film)","context":"Hannibal (film)\n Ten years after tracking and taking down serial killer Jame Gumb, FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling is unjustly blamed for a botched drug raid. She is later contacted by Mason Verger, the only surviving victim of the serial killer Hannibal Lecter. A wealthy child molester, Verger was paralyzed and horribly disfigured by Lecter during a therapy session. He has been pursuing an elaborate scheme to capture, torture, and kill Lecter ever since. Using his wealth and political influence, Verger has Starling reassigned to Lecter's case, hoping her involvement will draw Lecter out.\nAfter learning of Starling's public disgrace, Lecter sends her a taunting letter. Starling detects a strange fragrance from the letter. A perfume expert later identifies a skin cream whose ingredients are only available to a few shops in the world. She contacts the police departments of the cities where the shops are located, requesting surveillance tapes. In Florence, one of said cities, Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi is investigating the disappearance of a library curator. Pazzi questions Lecter, who is masquerading as Dr. Fell, the assistant curator and caretaker.\nUpon recognizing Dr. Fell in the surveillance tape, Pazzi accesses the ViCAP database of wanted fugitives. He then learns of Verger's US$3 million personal bounty on Lecter. Blinded by greed, Pazzi ignores Starling's warnings and attempts to capture Lecter alone. He recruits a pickpocket to obtain Lecter's fingerprint to show Verger as proof. The pickpocket, mortally wounded by Lecter, manages to get the print and provides it to Pazzi. Lecter baits Pazzi into an isolated room of the Palazzo Vecchio, ties him up, then disembowels and hangs him. He then heads back to the United States.\nVerger bribes Justice Department official Paul Krendler to accuse Starling of withholding a note from Lecter, leading to her suspension. Lecter lures Starling to Union Station. Verger's men, having trailed Starling, capture and bring Lecter to Verger. Verger means to feed Lecter alive to a herd of wild boars bred specifically for this purpose. After her superiors refuse to act, Starling infiltrates Verger's estate. After neutralizing the two guards and freeing Lecter she is shot by a third guard that was in hiding. Lecter picks up an unconscious Starling just before the boars break through the doors, they are on their way out when Verger arrives. He orders his physician Cordell Doemling to shoot Lecter, but with Lecter's suggestion, Cordell shoves his hated boss into the pen. Lecter carries Starling and watches the boars eat Verger alive.\nLecter takes Starling to Krendler's secluded lake house and treats her wounds. When Krendler arrives for the Fourth of July, Lecter subdues and drugs him. Starling, disoriented by morphine and dressed in a black velvet evening gown, awakens to find Krendler seated at the table set for an elegant dinner. Weakened by the drugs, she looks on in horror as Lecter removes part of Krendler's prefrontal cortex, saut\u0102\u0160s it, and feeds it to him.\nAfter the meal, Starling tries to attack Lecter but he overpowers her and the two share a kiss. Starling then handcuffs his wrist to hers. Hearing the police closing in, Lecter uses a meat cleaver to sever his own wrist in order to free their cuffed hands and escapes. Lecter is later seen on a flight with his own boxed lunch. As he prepares to eat his meal, including what is assumed to be part of a cooked brain, a young boy seated next to him asks to try some of his food. Initially reluctant, Lecter then lets the boy eat some of his lunch.\n<html>\n\n<head>\n   <title>\"Hannibal\", production draft, by Steven Zaillian<\/title>\n<\/head>\n\n<body bgcolor=\"#ffffff\">\n   <pre>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                          <u>H A N N I B A L<\/u>\n                                    \n\n                            Screenplay\n                                by\n                          Steven Zaillian\n\n\n\n                                  \n                         Based on the Novel\n                                by\n                           Thomas Harris\n\n\n                                 \n\n                                 \n\n                                 \n\n                                 \n\n     <u>Revision<\/u>\n     <u>February 9, 2000<\/u>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     INT.

Three other\n     agents sit perched on the opposite bench, staring at her\n     lifeless body.\n\n                          BURKE\n               How can she sleep at a time like this?\n\n                          BRIGHAM\n               She's on a jump-out squad all night;\n               she's saving her strength.\n\n     INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - DAY\n\n     Gray cement walls blur past as the panel van descends a\n     circular ramp to a lower level.  As it straightens out, the\n     view through the windshield reveals a gathering of men and\n     vehicles - marked and unmarked DC police cars - and two black\n     SWAT vans.\n\n     The panel van - with <i>Marcell's Crab House<\/i> painted on its\n     sides - pulls to a stop.  The back doors open from the inside\n     and Starling is the first one out - well-rested and alert -\n     hoisting down her equipment bag.\n\n     One of the DC policemen, the one whose girth and manner\n     say he's in charge, watches the woman by the van slip into a\n     Kevlar vest, drop a Colt .45 into a shoulder holster, and a\n     .38 into an ankle holster.  She straightens up, approaches\n     the men and lays a street plan across the hood of one of\n     their cars.\n\n                          STARLING\n               All right, everyone, pay attention.\n               Here's the layout -\n\n                          BOLTON\n               Excuse me, I'm Officer Bolton, DC Police.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Yes, I can see that from your uniform\n               and badge, how do you do?\n\n                          BOLTON\n               I'm in charge here.\n\n     Starling studies him a moment.

The <i>Marcell's Crab House<\/i> van continues\n     straight along Parcell Street.\n\n     INT. PANEL VAN - DAY\n\n     A 150-pound block of dry ice tries to cool down the heat\n     from all the bodies in the van - Starling and Brigham, the\n     two other agents, Burke and Hare, and her new best friend,\n     Officer Bolton.  As they drive along, Bolton watches as she\n     takes several pairs of surgical gloves from her equipment\n     bag, slips one pair on, and hands the rest to the others, the\n     last pair offered to him.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Drumgo's HIV positive and she <i>will<\/i> spit\n               and bite if she's cornered, so you might\n               want to put these on.\n                   (Bolton takes the gloves and\n                    puts them on)\n               And if you happen to be the one who\n               puts her in a patrol car in front of the\n               cameras, and I have a feeling you <i>will<\/i>\n               be, you don't want to push her head down,\n               she'll likely have a needle in her hair.\n\n     EXT. FISH MARKET AREA - DAY\n\n     The swat vans pull into position, one to the side of the\n     building across from the fish market, the other around back.\n     As the battered van pulls to the curb in front, a mint low-\n     rider Impala convertible, stereo thumping, cruises past.\n\n     INT. PANEL VAN - DAY\n\n     The thumping fades, leaving the <i>Macarena<\/i> filtering in.\n     Starling pulls the cover off the eyepiece of a periscope\n     bolted to the ceiling of the van and makes a full rotation\n     of the objective lens concealed in the roof ventilator, catching\n     glimpses of:\n\n     A man with big forearms cutting up a mako shark with a\n     curved knife, hosing the big fish down with a powerful hand-\n     held spray.\n\n     Young men idling on a corner in front of a bar.  Others\n     lounging in parked cars, talking.  Some children playing by\n     a burning mattress on the sidewalk; others in the rainbow\n     spray from the fishmonger's hose.\n\n     The building across from the fish market with the metal door\n     above concrete steps.

Showdown.\n               She's out front, we're moving.\n\n     Starling and the others put on their helmets.  Brigham racks\n     the slide of his riot gun.  The back doors opena and Starling\n     is the first one out, barking -\n\n                          STARLING\n               Down on the ground!  <i>Down on the ground!<\/i>\n\n     No one gets down on the ground - not Evelda Drumgo, not her\n     men, none of the merchants or bystanders.  <i>The Macarena<\/i> keeps\n     blaring.\n\n     Drumgo turns and Starling sees the baby in the blanketed\n     sling around her neck.  She can also hear the roar of a big\n     V8 and hopes it's her backup.\n\n     Drumgo turns slightly and the baby blanket flutters as the\n     MAC 10 under it fires, shattering Brigham's face shield.  As\n     he goes down, Hawaiian Shirt drops his satchel and fires a\n     shotgun, blowing out the car window next to Burke.\n\n     Gunshots from the V8, a Crip gunship, a Cadillac, coming\n     toward Starling.  Two shooters, Cheyenne-style in the rolled-\n     down window frames, spraying automatic fire over the top.\n\n     Starling dives behind two parked cars.  Hare and Bolton\n     fire from behind another.  Auto glass shatters and clangs on\n     the ground.\n\n     Everyone in the market scrambling for cover, finally hitting\n     the fish-bloodied cement.  <i>The Macarena<\/i> still blasting.\n\n     Pinned down, Starling watches the wiry black man drop back\n     against the building, Drumgo picks up the satchel, the gunship\n     slowing enough for someone to pull her in.\n\n     Starling stands and fires several shots, taking out Hawaiian\n     Shirt, the other man by the building, the driver of the accel-\n     erating Cadillac, one of the men perched on the window frames\n     - drops the magazine out of her .45 slams another in\n     before the empty hits the ground.\n\n     The Cadillac goes out of control, sideswiping a line of\n     cars, grinds to a stop against them.  Starling moving toward\n     it now, following the sight of her gun.  A shooter still\n     sitting in a window frame, alive but trapped, chest\n     compressed between the Cadillac and a parked car.  Gunfire\n     from somewhere behind Starling hits him and shatters the rear\n     window.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Hold it!  Hold your fire!

Then Drumgo emerges from the car, head\n     down, hands buried in the blanket-sling, cradling the crying\n     baby.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Show me your hands!\n                   (Evelda doesn't)\n               <i>Please!<\/i>  Show me your hands!\n\n     Evelda looks up at her finally, fondly it seems, doesn't show\n     her hands.\n\n                          DRUMGO\n               Is that <i>you<\/i>, Starling?\n\n                          STARLING\n               Show me your hands!\n\n                          DRUMGO\n               How you been?\n\n                          STARLING\n               Don't do this!\n\n                          DRUMGO\n               Do what?\n\n     She smiles sweetly.  The blanket flutters.  Starling falls.\n     Fires high enough to miss the baby.  Hits Drumgo in the neck.\n     She goes down.\n\n     Starling crawling in the street, the wind knocked out of\n     her from the hits to her chest, to her vest.  Reaches Drumgo,\n     blood gushing out of her onto the baby.  She pulls out a\n     knife.  Cuts the harness straps.  Runs with the baby to the\n     merchant stalls as enterprising tourists click shots from the\n     ground with disposable cameras.\n\n     Starling sweeps away knives and fish guts from a cutting\n     table.  Lays the baby down.  Strips it.  Grabs the handheld\n     sprayer and washes at the slick coating of HIV positive blood\n     covering the baby, a shark's head staring, <i>Macarena<\/i> pounding,\n     disposable cameras clicking, the river of bloody water\n     running along a gutter to where Brigham lies dead.\n\n     EXT.

A large gathering, many in\n     uniform, standing in wet grass around an open grave, the rain\n     spilling off the rims of their umbrellas.\n\n     A casket is being lowered in.  Starling watches as it\n     decends, watches the gears of the hoist working and the box\n     disappearing beneath the edge of the muddy hole, not allowing\n     herself to cry, or to meet the eyes of certain other mourners\n     watching <i>her<\/i>.\n\n     EXT.

Smoke plumes from the exhaust of the one\n     idling nearest, a Crown Victoria.\n\n     Inside the car, Starling sits in the front passenger seat\n     with a cardboard box on her lap, a middle-aged man in Marine\n     dress blues beside her at the wheel.

As\n     the car passes, their cameras swing around to point at\n     Starling's side of it and flash like stars.\n\n     INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - FBI DC FIELD OFFICE - DAY\n\n     The words \"Fidelity, Bravery, Integrity\" skew as a glass\n     door opens.

I gave Drumgo a chance - two\n               chances - to surrender.  She didn't.  She\n               fired.  She shot John Brigham.  She shot\n               at me.  And I shot her.

I ended\n               up in a position where I had a choice of\n               dying, or shooting a woman carrying a\n               child.  I chose.  I shot her -\n\n     FLASHCUT to Drumgo - hit in the neck by Starling's bullet -\n     silently falling to the ground -\n\n                          STARLING\n               I killed a mother holding her child.\n               The lower <i>animals<\/i> don't do that.

Then spikes across the\n     18th green, taps it in, and groans the way anyone over forty\n     does as he bends down to retrieve it.\n\n     Pocketing it he turns, sees Starling standing outside the\n     club house.  She waves, bending just a couple of fingers, and\n     he smiles, pleased, but not surprised to see her.\n\n     EXT. MIAMI - DAY\n\n     Crawford and Starling driving in his car, the clubs in the\n     back seat.  Palm trees float by.\n\n                          STARLING\n               What's your handicap?\n\n                          CRAWFORD\n               My handicap is I can't play golf.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Maybe better clubs would help.\n\n                          CRAWFORD\n               I play with the best clubs money can buy.\n               It's not the clubs, it's a woeful lack of\n               talent.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Or interest.\n\n     He nods - yeah, that's the real problem with it - turns onto\n     another street.\n\n                          CRAWFORD\n               Were my flowers at John's service okay?\n               Lot of times, flowers by wire, you never\n               know.\n\n                          STARLING\n               They were canary daffodils.\n                   (he groans)\n               I put your name on my flowers.\n\n                          CRAWFORD\n               Thank you.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Thank you.

BUILDING - DAY\n\n     Frameless glass doors in a sleek office building, etched:\n     <i>Allied Security, Threat Assessment, Miami, Los Angeles, Rio\n     de Janeiro.<\/i>  Crawford holds one open for Starling and\n     follows her into a handsome reception area.\n\n                          RECEPTIONIST\n               How was it?  Better today?\n\n                          CRAWFORD\n               The clubs are in the dumpster downstairs\n               if anyone wants them.\n\n     He leads Starling deeper into the place, past pairs of men\n     in nice suits conferring in the doorway of a kitchenette and\n     over by a long bank of filing cabinets.  Male and female\n     secretaries move about.\n\n                          CRAWFORD\n               Nice, huh?  This could all be yours,\n               Starling.  I can get you a PI ticket in\n               Florida tomorrow, you can chase insurance\n               scams, extortion against the cruise\n               lines, put down the gun and have some fun\n               with me.\n\n     Crawford accepts a handful of pink phone-message slips as\n     they come past his secretary's desk, holds another door open\n     and Starling steps into his office.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Tempting.\n\n                          CRAWFORD\n               Just wait.\n\n     The door closing softly behind her says, \"expensive\n     hardware.\"\n\n     INT. CRAWFORD'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n     They sit, Crawford behind his mahogany desk, Starling in a\n     comfortable chair.  As he rifles through the phone\n     messages -\n\n                          CRAWFORD\n               The call I made wasn't to Assistant\n               Director Noonan.  Whoever called <i>him<\/i>, I\n               don't know.  <i>I<\/i> called Mason Verger.\n\n     He lets the name sink in, lets her dive for it, try to\n     place it.  She can't.  It's familiar but doesn't connect to\n     anything stable.\n\n                          CRAWFORD\n               Lecter's fourth victim, Starling.\n               The one who lived, if you can call it\n               living.  The rich one.\n\n     He slides over a couple of photographs of a young man with a\n     kind, trusting face.  Now she remembers him.\n\n                          CRAWFORD\n               I told Mason I wanted you off the\n               street.  I told him what I told you when\n               I left the Bureau, \"You go out with a gun\n               enough times, you will be killed by one.\"\n               I told him I want you where you belong,\n               in Behavioral Science.  Know what he said?\n\n                          STARLING\n               He can speak?\n\n                          CRAWFORD\n               It's about the only thing he can do.\n               He said, after a very long pause, \"Oh,\n               what a good idea, Jack.\"\n                   (Crawford tries to smile)\n               Who <i>he<\/i> called, I don't know.  Someone\n               higher up than anyone in that room with\n               you.  Maybe Representative Vollmer, who\n               Mason may not <i>own<\/i>, but does <i>rent<\/i> from\n               time to time.\n\n     Silence as Starling tries to take it all in.  She looks up\n     with a question forming in her mind, and Crawford nods before\n     she can say it.  Very matter of fact -\n\n                          CRAWFORD\n               Yeah, that's right, it means going back\n               on the Lecter case.\n\n     He busies himself with the phone messages again, arranging\n     them in little, prioritized piles on his desk, as if perhaps\n     this conversation is about nothing more important than a\n     simple missing person case.\n\n                          STARLING\n               What if I said to you I'd rather not\n               do that?  What if I said to you I <i>prefer<\/i>\n               the street?\n\n                          CRAWFORD\n               You think this is a cheap deal?  What\n               you were <i>getting<\/i> was a cheap deal.  What\n               they say about federal examiners is true:\n               they arrive after the battle and bayonet\n               the wounded.  You're not safe on the\n               street anymore.\n\n     Starling takes another look at the photographs of Verger.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Has something happened on the case?\n\n                          CRAWFORD\n               Has Lecter killed anybody lately?  I\n               wouldn't know, I'm retired from all that.\n               Mason doesn't know either, but he does\n               apparently have some new information -\n               which he'll only share with you.\n\n     They consider one another for a long moment.  Finally -\n\n                          CRAWFORD\n               He's not pretty, Starling.  And I don't\n               just mean his face.\n\n     EXT. MARYLAND - DAY\n\n     Bare trees.  Overcast sky.  Starling's Mustang growling along\n     the rain-slicked expressway.\n\n     INT. MUSTANG - MOVING - DAY\n\n     A Maryland state map spread out across the passenger seat.\n     Starling's eyes darting back and forth between the black and\n     red route-veins and the shrouded countryside out beyond the\n     slapping wiper blades.\n\n     An exit sign - and the exit itself - looms suddenly and\n     rushes across the right side of her windshield.  She curses\n     to herself.  It's the exit she wanted, but now it's gone,\n     shrinking in her rearview mirror into the mist.\n\n     EXT. THE VERGER ESTATE - DAY\n\n     Coming back the other way along a service road, Starling\n     slows to consider a chain-link gate stretched across a muddy\n     road, then continues on.\n\n     At the gate house of the main entrance, a security guard\n     checks her name against a list.  He seems reluctant to get\n     himself or his clipboard wet, but not her identification,\n     handing it out past the edge of his umbrella to her.\n\n     The Mustang negotiates a long circuitous drive, taking her\n     deeper and deeper into vast forest land.  Eventually, though,\n     a good mile from the gate house behind her, the trees give\n     way to a clearing, and she sees the big Stanford White-\n     designed mansion emerging from the mist up ahead.\n\n     A man waits under an umbrella out front, indicates to her\n     where to park - <i>anywhere<\/i>, one should think - there's enough\n     space for fifty cars - then comes around to the driver's side\n     and opens the door.\n\n                          CORDELL\n               Ms. Starling.  Hi.  I'm Cordell.  Mr.\n               Verger's private physician.\n\n                          STARLING\n               How do you do?\n\n     She gathers her things out from under the map:  file folder,\n     micro-cassette recorder, extra tapes and batteries.  He helps\n     her out, then presses up against her to help maximize the\n     umbrella's effectiveness.\n\n                          CORDELL\n               Shall we make a run for it?\n\n     As they hurry toward the porch - if it can be called a\n     porch, as grand an entrance as a king's, or English rock\n     star's manor - Starling notices the building's one modern\n     wing, sticking out like an extra limb attached in some\n     grotesque medical experiment.\n\n     INT. VERGER'S MANSION - DAY\n\n     They cross through a living room larger than most houses,\n     then down a hall, their shoes moving along a Moroccan runner,\n     sleeves past portraits of important-looking dead people.\n\n     As they cross a threshold there's an abrupt shear in style:\n     the rich carpet giving way to polished institutional floors,\n     the portrait-lined walls to shiny white enamel.\n\n     Cordell reaches for the handle of a closed door in the new\n     wing, and Starling notices line of lights appear around the\n     jamb where there were none.\n\n     As the door opens, she squints.  Two small photographer's\n     spots on stands pitch narrow beams of light into her face and\n     seem to follow her progress into the room.\n\n                          CORDELL\n                   (a whisper)\n               One's eyes adjust to the darkness.\n               This way is better.\n\n     He leads her to a sitting area where a print of William\n     Blake's \"The Ancient of Days\" hangs above a large aquarium\n     divided in two by a wall of glass - an ell gliding around on\n     one side, a fish on the other.  A bank of security monitors\n     completes the decor.  To the spotlight -\n\n                          CORDELL\n               Mr. Verger, Ms. Starling is here.\n\n     The light stands flank a hospital bed, the beams effectively\n     camouflaging the figure on it in their glare.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Good morning, Mr. Verger.\n\n                          MASON\n               Cordell, do you address a judge as Mr?\n\n     The voice is steady and resonant.  An \"educated\" voice, not\n     unlike Lecter's.  Before Cordell can answer him -\n\n                          MASON\n               Agent Starling is her proper title,\n               not <i>\"Ms.\"<\/i>\n\n                          CORDELL\n               <i>Agent<\/i> Starling.\n\n                          MASON\n               Correct.

Snaps open the little door of\n     her cassette recorder to verify there's a tape inside.\n\n                          MASON\n               Was that a Mustang I heard out there?\n\n                          STARLING\n               Yes, it was.\n\n                          MASON\n               Five-liter?\n\n                          STARLING\n               '88 Stroker.\n\n                          MASON\n               Fast.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Yes.\n\n                          MASON\n               Where'd you get it?\n\n                          STARLING\n               Dope auction.\n\n                          MASON\n               Very good.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Mr. Verger, the discussion we're going\n               to have is in the nature of a deposition.\n               I'll need to tape record it if that's all\n               right with you.\n\n                          MASON\n               Cordell, I think you can leave us now.\n\n                          CORDELL\n               I thought I might stay.  Perhaps I could\n               be useful if -\n\n                          MASON\n               You could be useful seeing about my\n               lunch.\n\n     Starling gets up, but not to see him out.  Once he's gone -\n\n                          STARLING\n               I'd like to attach this microphone to\n               your - clothing, or pillow - if you're\n               comfortable with that.\n\n                          MASON\n               By all means.\n\n     She walks slowly toward the bed, or rather to the lights,\n     uncertain exactly what position Verger may be in - on his\n     back, his side; she has no way of knowing.\n\n                          MASON\n               Here, this should make it easier.\n\n     A finger like a pale spider crab moves along the sheet and\n     depresses a button.  The lights suddenly extinguish and\n     Starling's pupils dilate.  As her eyes adjust to the darkness\n     Verger's face materializes in it like something dead rising\n     up through dark water:\n\n     <i>Face<\/i> is the wrong word.  He has no face to speak of.  No\n     skin, at least.  Teeth he has.  He looks like some kind of\n     creature that resides in the lowest depths of the sea.\n\n     She doesn't flinch.  Maybe the hand with the microphone\n     recoils an inch or two, but that's it.  She clips it to the\n     flannel lapel of his pajamas, drapes the skinny cord over the\n     side of the pillow and sets the recorder on the medical table\n     next to the bed.\n\n                          MASON\n               You know, I thank God for what happened.\n               It was my salvation.

It was a Christian camp\n               my father paid for.  Paid for the whole\n               thing, all 125 campers on Lake Michigan.\n               Many of them were unfortunate, cast-off\n               little boys and girls would do <i>anything<\/i>\n               for a candy bar.  Maybe I took advantage\n               of that.

He was too\n               professional to just sort of \"drop in.\"\n               I answered the door in my nicest come-\n               hither leather outfit.\n\n     FLASHCUT of the door opening, revealing Verger, in his\n     leather gear, his face young and pretty.\n\n                          MASON\n               I was concerned he'd be afraid of me,\n               but he didn't seem to be.  <i>Afraid<\/i> of me;\n               that's funny now.\n\n     FLASHCUT of Verger leading Lecter upstairs, each with a glass\n     of wine in hand.\n\n                          MASON\n               I showed him my toys, my noose set-up\n               among other things - where you sort of\n               <i>hang<\/i> yourself but not really.

Cordell comes in\n     quietly with Verger's lunch on a rolling cart, and trying not\n     to interrupt, arranges the silverware and pours some water.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Mr. Verger, you -\n\n                          MASON\n               Are you <i>shocked<\/i>, Agent S?\n\n                          STARLING\n               You indicated to -\n                   (her eyes dart to the tape, and\n                    his follow them)\n               - to my office - that you've received\n               some kind of new information.\n\n                          MASON\n               Look in the drawer of the end table.\n\n     Starling takes out a pair of thin cotton gloves and puts\n     them on.  In the drawer she finds a large manila envelope and\n     in <i>it<\/i>, an x-ray of an arm.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Where did this come from?\n\n                          MASON\n               Buenos Aires.

Couple of old enlargers, chemical trays, an ugly\n     rented couch, a metal desk, a computer, and a blackboard on\n     wheels she has chalked with the headings \"Lecter\" and\n     \"Verger,\" a few scribbled notes under each name.\n\n     She's taken the video tape from the paltry contents of the\n     evidence box and puts in in a VCR.  In a moment, a scene in\n     black and white, captured by a security camera at the\n     Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, plays out\n     in silence:\n\n     Lecter wired up for an EKG.  A female nurse getting too\n     close.  Lecter attacking her.  Biting her.

His\n     eyes are eager now, his demeanor painfully solicitous, like a\n     sweetly disarming little boy waiting for the baseball players\n     to finish batting practive.  Starling turns and leaves.\n\n     EXT. MARYLAND-MISERACORDIA GENERAL HOSPITAL - DAY\n\n     A wailing siren.  Ambulance pulling up in front of an\n     Emergency Entrance.  Paramedics climb out, hoist down a\n     gurney and the bleeding gunshot victim on in, and hurry him\n     in past the automatic doors.  The doors thump shut.\n\n     A moment later they open again and an orderly - same one\n     from the tape - steps out, finished with his shift, coat over\n     his uniform.  He hitches up his collar and steps out into the\n     drizzling rain as Starling, across the street in a hooded\n     sweatshirt, watches.\n\n     EXT. STREETS - LATER - DAY\n\n     The orderly moves along a wet sidewalk, heading home,\n     Starling following at a distance.  He stops.  She stops.  He\n     glances to something in the middle of the street.  A dead\n     dove, one wing fluttering in the wind.  He looks up.  Sees\n     its mate pacing on a wire.  Car tires hiss past below.\n\n     Starling watches as he crosses to the center of the street,\n     picks up the dead dove and pockets it, crosses back and\n     continues on.  She, and the surviving bird, follow.\n\n     INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - UPSTAIRS HALL - DAY\n\n     Starling knocks.  Waits.  The door opens and the orderly\n     peers out with the dead dove in his hands.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Hi, Barney.

BARNEY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS\n\n     Barney sets the dove on a desk and drags a computer mouse\n     to the \"file close\" x.  Just before the screen reverts to the\n     AOL Welcome page, Starling glimpses the site he was on when\n     she interrupted him with her knock - stock quotes.\n\n                          STARLING\n               How you been?\n\n     He doesn't answer.  Sits his huge frame down on his desk\n     chair.  She moves some newspapers aside on a couch, one of\n     which shows a photo of her from the Drumgo raid.  They\n     consider each other for a moment.  Eventually -\n\n                          STARLING\n               Barney, back when you turned Dr. Lecter\n               over to the Tennessee Police -\n\n                          BARNEY\n               They weren't civil to him.

You survived him six\n               years at the asylum.  How'd you do that?\n               It wasn't just being civil.\n\n                          BARNEY\n               Yes, it was.\n\n     They both hear something - a flutter - and glance out to the\n     fire escape.  The dead dove's mate has landed on the railing.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Did you ever think, once he escaped,\n               he might come after you?\n\n                          BARNEY\n               No.  He told me once that, whenever\n               feasible, he preferred to eat the rude.\n               \"Free-range rude,\" he called them.\n\n     He smiles.  Glances out the window again to the cooing dove.\n     Picks up the dead one, carries it out and sets it down on the\n     wet grating.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Any idea what happened to all his stuff?\n               His books and papers and drawings and -\n\n                          BARNEY\n               Everything got thrown out when the place\n               closed.\n\n     He comes back in.  She starts to say something, hesitates.\n     Once she starts on <i>this<\/i> subject, she knows one of them will\n     wind up very unhappy.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Barney, I just found out that Dr.\n               Lecter's signed copy of <i>The Joy of\n               Cooking<\/i> went to a private collector for\n               sixteen thousand dollars.\n\n                          BARNEY\n               It was probably a fake.\n\n                          STARLING\n               The seller's affidavit of ownership\n               was signed, <i>Karen Phlox<\/i>.

Maybe I could get\n               it back.\n\n                          STARLING\n               I want the x-ray.  From when you broke\n               his arm after he attacked that nurse.\n\n     Barney gets up again, but doesn't run off to get it.  He\n     slowly paces around.\n\n                          BARNEY\n               We talked about a lot of things, late at\n               night, after all the screaming died down.\n               We talked about you sometimes.  Want to\n               know what he said?\n\n                          STARLING\n               No, just the x-ray.\n\n                          BARNEY\n               Is there a reward?\n\n                          STARLING\n               Yeah.  The reward is I don't have my\n               friend the Postal Inspector nail you on\n               <i>Use of the Mails to Defraud<\/i>, you don't\n               get ten years, and you don't come out\n               with a janitor's job and a room at the Y,\n               sitting on the side of your bunk at night\n               listening to yourself cough.\n\n     He stares at her, gets up finally, disappears into the\n     bedroom.  Starling looks out to the fire escape again.  The\n     surviving dove has dropped down and is now walking in circles\n     around its lifeless mate.\n\n     Barney returns with a file box and a large envelope.  Hands\n     it all to her.  She unfurls the string-clasp.  Pulls out an x-\n     ray of an arm.  A radiologist's and Lecter's names are on it.\n\n                          BARNEY\n               I'm not a bad guy.\n\n                          STARLING\n               I didn't say you were.\n\n                          BARNEY\n               Dr. <i>Chilton<\/i> is a bad guy.

But I believe your gratitude is\n               sincere.\n\n     He goes to a fuse box on the wall.  Takes something out of\n     it.  Turns around to face Starling, wearing the famous mask\n     from <i>Silence of the Lambs<\/i>, and her hand flashes toward her\n     sidearm, a movement quickly stopped.\n\n                          BARNEY\n               This is my retirement fund.\n                   (removes the mask)\n               <i>If<\/i> you'll let me keep it.

About me?  Late at\n               night.\n\n                          BARNEY\n               We were talking about inherited, hard-\n               wired behavior.  He was using genetics in\n               roller pigeons as an example.\n               They go way up in the air and roll over\n               backwards in a display, falling toward\n               the ground.  There are shallow rollers\n               and deep rollers.  You can't breed two\n               deep rollers or the offspring will roll\n               all the way down, crash and die.  He\n               said, \"Officer Starling is a deep roller,\n               Barney.

Notice a small darkened room to\n     one side.  But the music seems to be coming from elsewhere, so\n     we continue on, down the hall to a pair of tall double doors,\n     open, allowing us into the main salon.

Leaves with his cart.\n     Annoyed at herself for getting her paw prints all over the\n     letter, she reaches for her key chain, slits the envelope\n     with the Swiss Army knife on it, and extracts and unfolds the\n     letter with the blade.

FLORENCE - DAY\n\n     Vespas, Fiats and Innocenti speed around a traffic circle.\n     Pedestrians move along the boulevard.  We follow one man who\n     seems vaguely familiar - we glimpsed him briefly several days\n     ago walking past Fell's residence just before we went in, and\n     once before that, if we recall, polishing the floor in the\n     Palazzo Vecchio.\n\n     Right now, though, we're more interested in Pazzi who joins\n     the frame coming toward us, and we follow him instead, to and\n     up the steps of the Questura building.\n\n     INT. QUESTURA - DAY\n\n     A black and white step-framed image of Dr. Fell entering a\n     small perfume shop.  It plays on a monitor sitting atop two\n     VCR decks, one on <i>Play,<\/i> the other <i>Record,<\/i> the operator, a\n     young agent, smoking as he writes out a label.\n\n     Pazzi hangs his coat on a rack, crosses through the large\n     room, and sits at his desk which happens to be right next to\n     the VCR, which he pays no attention to.  At the next desk,\n     Ricci sits working on a crossword puzzle.\n\n                          PAZZI\n               I need opera tickets.\n\n                          RICCI\n                   (without looking up)\n               Don't think I have any on me.\n\n                          PAZZI\n               It's sold out, whatever it's called.\n\n     A couple of Pazzi's colleagues, ones who are <i>now<\/i> working on\n     the <i>Il Mostro<\/i> case instead of him, surrounded by\n     photographs and clippings on the crimes, exchange a look.\n\n                          DETECTIVE\n               It's the pretty young wife with the\n               ever-open <i>beak<\/i> who needs opera tickets.\n\n     Pazzi glances over at them, not sure he heard right.  One\n     sneaks a glance at the other.  It's all they can do to keep\n     from laughing.  The tape of the customers coming and going\n     at the perfume store contines, but Pazzi doesn't notice.\n\n                          PAZZI\n               Botticelli.\n\n                          DETECTIVE\n               What?\n\n                          PAZZI\n               He arranges his victims like that\n               Botticelli painting.  You hadn't noticed?\n\n     As Pazzi glances away from them, he catches a glimpse of the\n     monitor, of Fell coming into the perfume shop again.  He gets\n     up and the <i>Il Mostro<\/i> detectives, thinking he's coming for\n     them, decide to go out for coffee.\n\n                          PAZZI\n               Back that up.\n\n                          YOUNG AGENT\n               What?  I can't back it up.  I'm making a\n               copy.  I'm recording.\n\n     The black and white images of customers, most of them women,\n     continue, until Pazzi hits the stop button and spins the jog.\n     The young agent groans, but not <i>too<\/i> loud; Pazzi far outranks\n     him.  The image reverses.  Pazzi freezes it on one of the\n     step frames that shows Dr. Fell.\n\n                          PAZZI\n               What is this?\n\n                          YOUNG AGENT\n               Security camera from a perfume shop on\n               Villa Della Scula.  FBI through Interpol\n               requested a copy.\n\n                          PAZZI\n               Why?\n\n                          YOUNG AGENT\n               They didn't say.\n\n                          PAZZI\n               They didn't <i>say?<\/i>\n\n                          YOUNG AGENT\n               It was actually kind of weird.  Like\n               they were making a point of not saying.\n\n     Pazzi unpauses it.  Watches Fell approach the counter and\n     then wait, it seems, for a long time as the perfumer mixes up\n     some kind of concoction.  Money exchanges hands and Fell,\n     with his purchase, leaves.\n\n     INT. PAZZI'S APARTMENT - STUDY - NIGHT\n\n     As a search engine works, Pazzi glances down at copies of\n     Fell's state work permit and <i>Permesso di Soggiorno<\/i> resting\n     next to the computer.  The video cassette is there, too.\n     And the over-night mailer.\n\n     The FBI's consumer home page appears on the screen.  Pazzi\n     selects the <i>10 Most Wanted<\/i> button, and in a moment, the list\n     - with pictures - is displayed.\n\n     The World Trade Center bombing mastermind is #1.  Beneath\n     him, nine other, lesser bombers and murderers, none of whom\n     look anything like Fell.\n\n     He shifts back to the main page.  Selects <i>Archives<\/i>.  The\n     50 Most Wanted list appears - bank robbers and killers and\n     arsonists, all with photos or police sketches, all but one\n     man.  He scrolls down, stops.  Dr. Fell - <i>Hannibal Lecter -\n     \"Hannibal the Cannibal\"<\/i> - is looking right at him.\n\n                          ALLEGRA\n               Rinaldo.\n\n     He doesn't seem to hear her as he begins reading the text\n     under Lecter's digitally-enhanced picture.\n\n                          ALLEGRA\n               <i>Rinaldo.<\/i>\n\n     He glances up finally.  His young wife - who is indeed pretty\n     - stands in the doorway of the study.\n\n                          PAZZI\n               I'm sorry.\n\n                          ALLEGRA\n               Are we going to the Teatro Michahelles?\n\n                          PAZZI\n               Yes.\n\n                          ALLEGRA\n               You got tickets.\n\n                          PAZZI\n               No.  But I will.

No matter what the\n               cost.\n\n     Unconvinced the promise will hold, she leaves the room.\n\n     Pazzi opens his filofax to the <i>F<\/i> tab, finds a number written\n     under no heading, a code, enters it into his computer and in\n     a moment is taken to the FBI's private VICAP site - Violent\n     Criminal Apprehensopn Program.\n\n     He types in <i>Lecter<\/i> and scans the internal 302 reports that\n     are displayed, many of them prepared by Special Agent Clarice\n     Starling.\n\n     He returns to the server screen.  Begins a new search.\n     <i>Hannibal Lecter<\/i>.  Many of the same sites Starling found are\n     listed, the ones posted by nuts.\n\n     He scrolls down to the <i>Refine Search<\/i> panel.  Adds one word\n     to his <i>Hannibal Lecter<\/i> query.  <i>Reward<\/i>.  Hits <i>Return<\/i>.\n\n     Only one site includes the word in its page name.  Pazzi goes\n     to it.  No graphics other than the same picture the FBI site\n     showed.  No indication of whose site it is.\n\n     Dry text describes Lecter, reminds the reader he should be\n     regarded as armed and dangerous, and encourages informants to\n     call the provided FBI number with any information.\n\n     There is also a private number listed - European dialing\n     code, not U.S.  Oh, and one more small piece of information.\n     The reward.  <i>$3,000,000.<\/i>\n\n     INT.

The only light is\n     coming from a monitor showing Lecter's escape from Memphis,\n     as caught by high-angle security cameras.\n\n     He considers a display Starling has erected to Lecter's nine\n     known victims.  One is Mason Verger.  Another, a man attached\n     to a tool shop peg board with metal rods piercing his body as\n     in an illustration next to it of the medieval <i>Wound Man.<\/i>\n\n     He becomes intrigued by a sketch on a standing easel of\n     Starling, signed by Hannibal Lecter.

FLORENCE - DAY\n\n     A fistful of 1,000-lira coins makes a dull <i>ching<\/i> as Pazzi\n     shakes them in his hand like dice he's not sure he wants to\n     throw.  He's staring at a pay phone ten paces away.  No one's\n     using it.  It's his if he wants it; clearly he isn't sure.\n\n     He finally walks over to it.  Lifts the receiver.  Presses \n     in the sequence of numbers scribbled in pen on the back of\n     the hand that holds the change.\n\n     A series of long distance tones beeps like a tinny death\n     knell.  A tinny recorded voice tells him to deposit 9,000-\n     lira for the first three minutes.\n\n     He drops nine coins in the slot with a shaky hand.  The\n     call connects and another recorded voice tells him the number\n     he has dialed is no longer in service.\n\n     He hangs up, relieved.  Begins to walk away with his so-\n     called reputation intact.  The phone rings.  He looks back at\n     it.  It rings again.  He begins to walk toward it.  It rings\n     again.  He reaches for it, hesitates, picks it up, and hears\n     a voice - not recorded - American accent - a man.\n\n                          VOICE\n               Yes?\n                   (Pazzi doesn't answer)\n               Hel-<i>lo?<\/i>\n\n                          PAZZI\n               I have information about Hannibal Lecter.\n\n                          VOICE\n               Does it include where he is now?\n\n                          PAZZI\n               Is the reward still in effect?\n\n                          VOICE\n               Yes, it is.

Unfortunately, I think the heating\n               system was installed just about the same\n               time.\n\n     Fell reappears pulling on the gloves.  Elaborating a shiver,\n     he rubs them together.\n\n                          FELL\n               All right, let's drag these things down.\n               They're as heavy as bodies.\n\n     INT\/EXT. PERFUMERY - DAY\n\n     From across the street, Pazzi watches Fell inside the small\n     shop browsing at the glass bottles that line the shelves, his\n     ungloved hands clasped behind his back like someone looking\n     at great art, his nose taking in the cacophony of scents.\n\n     The hands unclasp.  A finger reaches to a bottle - but\n     doesn't touch it - moving slowly back and forth an inch away\n     from the label as a reading aid.  The hands return then to\n     their clasped position behind the back.\n\n     EXT. CAFE - LATER\n\n     Fell, alone at a table, his hand grasping a wine glass\n     firmly, bringing it to his lips, and setting it back down.\n     Pazzi, watching from across the street, smiles ... until\n     Fell takes a last sip, touches a napkin to his lips, slides\n     the cloth across the glass in a single, mechanical motion,\n     gets up and leaves.\n\n     INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY\n\n     Pazzi's hands peel tens of thousands of lira from his money\n     clip as a jeweler's hands rub a soft cloth at the blank face\n     of a silver ID bracelet.\n\n                          JEWELER\n               What would you like engraved on it, sir?\n\n                          PAZZI\n               Nothing.\n\n                          JEWELER\n               May I apply an anti-tarnish coating?\n\n                          PAZZI\n               No.\n\n     EXT. ROAD TO PRATO - DAY\n\n     Sollicciano, the dreaded Florentine jail.\n\n     INT. JAIL - WOMEN'S DIVISION - DAY\n\n     A young woman's eyes drift down from Pazzi's tie clasp, to\n     his wedding band, to his silver ID bracelet.  In a crowd on\n     the street, she could remove all three in an instant and he\n     wouldn't even notice they were gone until he got home.\n\n                          ROMULA\n               What do you want?

FELL'S RESIDENCE - DAY\n\n     Fell emerges from his residence with a cloth shopping bag.\n     As he walks away on the cobblestoned street, a Vespa - with\n     Pazzi driving and Romula holding him around the waist - races\n     past and disappears into the traffic.\n\n     EXT. VERA DAL 1926 - LATER\n\n     Pazzi and Romula, on the parked scooter, watch Fell inside\n     the exclusive food shop selecting figs and white truffles.\n\n                          PAZZI\n               When you fumble for his wallet, he'll\n               catch you by the wrist -\n\n                          ROMULA\n               I've done this a few times, Inspector -\n\n                          PAZZI\n               Not like this.

The man can't\n               afford a problem.  He'll want to get away\n               from you more than you will from him.\n\n     Here he comes, out the door of the shop, the little bell\n     above it tinkling.  Pazzi waits a moment, then starts the\n     Vespa, puts it in gear.  As he blends in among cars racing\n     past Fell, the sound of a choir practicing - somewhere -\n     begins and carries over:\n\n     INT. CHURCH OF SAN CROCE - LATER\n\n     Tourists drop 200-lira pieces into coin boxes that trigger\n     light to be thrown across the great frescos of Christ.  The\n     clicking timers wind down after only a few moments and the\n     murals plunge back into incense-smoky darkness.\n\n     Pazzi, lurking in the vast cathedral by Galileo's grave,\n     points with his chin to a transept to the left of the main\n     altar.  There, Romula can see the kneeling shape of a lone\n     figure and the outline of his shopping bag.\n\n     Fell has brought along his art supplies and uses some now\n     to carefully make a charcoal rubbing of an inscription in the\n     stone.  To keep his hands clean, he wears a pair of thin\n     cotton gloves.\n\n     A bell sounds.  Midday closing.  Sextons coming out with\n     their keys to empty the coin boxes.  Tourists looking around\n     puzzled in the dark, not yet understanding they all have to\n     leave.  Pazzi watches Fell rise from his labors, carefully\n     place the charcoal rubbing in his shopping bag and pull the\n     gloves off.\n\n                          PAZZI\n                   (a whisper)\n               <i>Okay?<\/i>\n\n     She nods, moves away to the entrance of the church.  The\n     crowd will force Fell to pass right by her here.  Troubled by\n     something, though - a feeling - she looks down.  Sees she's\n     standing on the tomb of Michelangelo.  Steps off and whispers\n     to the slab -\n\n                          ROMULA\n               Sorry.\n\n     Fell is coming toward her in the dark, oblivious to what is\n     about to happen.  Someone reaches into a purse and fishes out\n     a 200-lira coin.\n\n     Romula begins to move toward the dark shape moving toward\n     her.  Her friend and protector, Gnocco, falls in a couple\n     steps behind her.  A hand drops the coin in a slot.\n\n     Just as Romula and her target are upon one another, a light\n     goes on illuminating a fresco of a bloodied Christ <i>and<\/i> Fell's\n     eyes, looking straight into hers and chilling her heart.  The\n     ticking of the coin box accompanies an awkward moment before\n     Romula manages -\n\n                          ROMULA\n               Excuse me.\n\n     She continues past Fell, the bracelet - untouched - jangling\n     dully on her wrist.  Fell looks back over his shoulder at the\n     woman.  She looks back over hers for a second, and the light\n     goes out leaving him in silhouette.\n\n     Fell walks away out past the doors and into the blinding\n     sunlight.  Pazzi wanders around in the dark and finally finds\n     Romula at a font, <u>scrubbing<\/u> her hands in the holy water.\n\n                          ROMULA\n               That's the Devil.\n\n     She takes the bracelet off and hands it to Pazzi.  He watches\n     water drip from it and his hands to the floor.\n\n                          PAZZI\n               So I'll drive you back to jail then.\n\n                          ROMULA\n               Yes.\n\n     She <i>splashes<\/i> holy water on her face.  Pazzi shakes his head\n     and glances away, watches absently as a sexton empties one of\n     the coin boxes, then notices Gnocco, standing in the shadows.\n\n     EXT. PIAZZA SANTO SPIRITO - NIGHT\n\n     The dark water of the Arno drifts slowly under a bridge.  On\n     the left bank, by the fountain, Gnocco and some other Gypsies\n     share a joint.  In between hits, Gnocco slices up an orange,\n     his eyes hazy but his hand quick with the blade, the juice of\n     the fruit dripping onto his fingers.\n\n                          GNOCCO\n               Two million lire.\n\n                          PAZZI\n               Fine.\n\n                          GNOCCO\n               Give me the bracelet.\n\n                          PAZZI\n               Wash your fuckin hands.\n\n     EXT. VIA SAN LEONARDO - NIGHT\n\n     Steep cobbled ill-lit street.  Gnocco leaning in a dark,\n     gated niche built into a high stone wall protecting villas\n     inside.  He finishes a joint, tosses it away.  Spits on the\n     bracelet and wipes it clean with the tail of his shirt.  As\n     he's about to put it on his wrist, his jacket vibrates.  With\n     his free hand he removes a cell phone from the pocket.\n\n                          PAZZI'S VOICE\n               He's coming.\n\n     The call disconnects.  Gnocco slips the phone back into the\n     pocket, clasps the bracelet around his wrist and steps out of\n     the shadows.\n\n     Several people appear around the corner, all of them well-\n     dressed.  A show must have just let out.  Gnocco walks up the\n     narrow street toward the column of advancing bobbing heads,\n     keeping his eyes on one of them.  Fell.\n\n     Gnocco and the group are upon each other.  Stoned and\n     swimming against the current, the pickpocket angles toward\n     his mark, bumps into him, reaches inside the elegant coat,\n     feels the wrist with the bracelet seized in a terrific grip,\n     twists it free hardly breaking stride, and emerges from\n     the tail of the throng.\n\n     He veers into another dark niche and bends over slightly\n     to catch his breath.  In a moment, quick footsteps announce\n     Pazzi's arrival.\n\n                          GNOCCO\n               I got it.  He grabbed me just right.\n               Tried to hit me in the <i>balls<\/i>, but he\n               missed.\n\n     He holds out the arm with the braclet for Pazzi to take it\n     off.  As the Inspector works carefully at the clasp, Gnocco\n     sucks in another deep breath of air.\n\n                          GNOCCO\n               Jesus -\n\n                          PAZZI\n               What - ?\n\n     Gnocco suddenly collapses to one knee, the bracelet pulling\n     from Pazzi's hands.  Blood begins to gush out of a neat tear\n     in his pants.\n\n     More confuses than in pain, Gnocco looks down at the blood\n     only to have it spray up into his face.  Trying to ignore the\n     blood - even as it sprays on <i>him<\/i> - Pazzi works to get the\n     bracelet off, and finally frees it.\n\n     Gnocco stares dumbly at himself in his praying position,\n     then tries to stop the flow of blood with his hand.  As he\n     collapses against the iron gate.  Pazzi sets the bracelet in\n     the box it came in, pockets it, then reaches into Gnocco's\n     bloody pocket and takes the phone.\n\n                          PAZZI\n               Here, let me help you.\n\n     Gnocco looks up at Pazzi gratefully, feels his hand being\n     moved away from the wound and held, feels nothing pressed in\n     its place, feels his blood drainging out of his body, then\n     feels nothing.  He's dead.\n\n     Pazzi gets up.  Takes out a handkerchief.  Wrapped inside is\n     a used syringe.  He tosses it on the ground and walks away.\n\n     INT. VERGER'S CHAMBER - DAY\n\n     Verger, lying in the dark, watches a technician in a pool\n     of bright light in the sitting area using a cordless power\n     screwdriver to back out the screws that secure the bracelet\n     to the jeweler's stand.  Carefully, he lifts it out of the\n     velvet box and sets it on a china plate.\n\n     A few flecks of dried blood fall onto the porcelain.  More\n     dried blood encrusts the silver.  He dusts the bracelet with\n     Dragon's Blood powder, angles a hot lamp at it and\n     photographs the one - <i>in situ<\/i> - print.\n\n     He comes around the tripod then and lifts the print, tapes it\n     to a slide and compares it to Lecter's FBI print card under a\n     microscope.  The swirling lines come into sharp focus.\n\n                          TECHNICIAN\n               Middle finger of the left hand.  Sixteen\n               point match.\n\n     EXT. SARDINIA - DAY\n\n     On a mountain farm deep in central Sardinia, a young man\n     wheels an empty, battered metal gurney along the fence-line\n     of a large pen.\n\n     Inside the adjacent shed, another young man picks through a\n     pile of old clothes.  In a corner, a third young man shuffles\n     through a small handful of audio cassette tapes.\n\n     Carlo and his gurney arrive.  His brother Matteo has chosen\n     an ensemble of pants and shirt, and lays it out on the sheet.\n     Carlo's cell phone rings.  He flips it open.\n\n                          MASON'S VOICE\n               Carlo?\n\n                          CARLO\n               Mason?\n\n                          MASON'S VOICE\n               Ciao, Bello.

Matteo splashes some expensive cologne on the\n     stuffed clothes and wheels the gurney out.\n\n                          MASON'S VOICE\n               Oh, I called at a good time.

Matteo is there,\n     lowering the gurney while Piero raises the volume on the boom\n     box.

PAZZI'S APARTMENT - EVENING\n\n     An aria can be heard as Allegra Pazzi, sitting at her\n     dressing table in her underclothes, uncaps a small unlabeled\n     bottle of perfume and carefully touches a drop to her wrist.\n\n     Across the bedroom, knotting a new tie that drapes against a\n     handmade linen shirt that still shows the fold-creases, Pazzi\n     watches as his wife lifts the wrist to her beautiful face,\n     smells the scent on it and smiles to herself.\n\n     Pazzi smiles, too, to himself, as he watches her place\n     another drop on the other wrist and two more just under her\n     diamond-studded ear lobes.\n\n     It's almost like watching sex.\n\n     INT. TEATRO MICHAHELLES - NIGHT\n\n     The aria fills the grand darkened interior of the theatre.\n     In a private box overlooking the stage, Pazzi sits with his\n     wife's hand in his - he in his new Sulka suit, she in her new\n     evening gown.  The scalped tickets for <i>these<\/i> seats must have\n     cost him a fortune, but then he can afford it now.\n\n     A whiteness down below, caught by the bounce of a stage\n     light, draws Pazzi's attention from the diva.  The bright\n     glow belongs to the starched French cuffs of a white dress\n     shirt poking out of dark sleeves, the hands intertwined, the\n     chin resting on them.\n\n     It's Dr. Fell, engrossed in the drama, lost in the harrowed\n     beauty of the <i>prima donna's<\/i> voice.  But then, the head come\n     around like an owl's, the eyes peering up to the private box.\n     Pazzi <i>had<\/i> a second of opportunity to look away but missed it,\n     and now their eyes meet.\n\n     Pazzi involuntarily squeezes his wife's hand.  The pressure\n     draws a loving look from her, but Pazzi's is still locked on\n     Fell's enigmatic little smile, much as he wishes it wasn't,\n     until a crescendo in the music - finally - draws Fell's\n     head and eyes back to the stage.  Applause.\n\n     EXT. TEATRO PICCOLOMINI - NIGHT\n\n     A crush of theatergoers maneuvers for cabs.\n\n                          DR. FELL\n               Enjoy the performance, <i>Commendatore?<\/i>\n\n     Pazzi and his wife, waiting for a free cab, turn to see Fell\n     standing behind them.  He smiles pleasantly.\n\n                          PAZZI\n               Very much.  Allegra, this is Dr. Fell,\n               Curator of the Capponi Library.\n\n                          DR. FELL\n               Curator <i>protempore<\/i>, Signora Pazzi.  I'm\n               honored.\n\n     Pazzi's eyes follow Fell's hand as it reaches to and holds\n     his wife's, his wrist bowing slightly.  Allegra smiles at his\n     grace and the graceful tone of his voice.\n\n                          ALLEGRA\n               Is that an American accent, doctor?\n\n                          DR. FELL\n               Canadian, <i>wrung<\/i> through the eastern sea-\n               board of America.\n\n                          ALLEGRA\n               I've always wanted to visit.  New England\n               especially.\n\n                          DR. FELL\n               Umm.  It's nice.  I've enjoyed many\n               excellent meals there.\n\n     Pazzi would very much enjoy <i>leaving<\/i>, and looks away hoping to\n     see a driver interested in his patronage.\n\n                          DR. FELL\n               Did I notice you following the score,\n               Signora?  Hardly anyone does it anymore.\n               Would this interest you?\n\n     From a portfolio under his arm, he produces a hand-copied\n     score on parchment - c. 1688 - each page in a plastic sleeve.\n\n                          DR. FELL\n               I've marked in overlay some of the\n               differences from the modern score, which\n               might amuse you.  Please take it.\n\n                          ALLEGRA\n               <i>Look<\/i> at this, Rinaldo.\n\n                          PAZZI\n               I can see it.\n\n     And both of their hands, Fell's and hers, on it.\n\n                          ALLEGRA\n               I did have some trouble with the\n               recitative at the beginning.\n\n                          DR. FELL\n               Dante's first sonnet from La Vita Nuova.\n               He saw Beatrice Portinari across a chapel\n               and he loved her at that instant and for\n               the rest of his life.  But then had a\n               disturbing dream -\n\n                          ALLEGRA\n                   (reading from text)\n               Joyous Love seemed to me, the while\n               he held my heart in his hands, and in his\n               arms, My lady lay asleep wrapped in a\n               veil -\n\n                          DR. FELL\n                   (continuing from memory)\n               He woke her then, and trembling and\n               obedient, she ate that burning heart out\n               of his hand.  Weeping, I saw him then\n               depart from me.\n\n                          ALLEGRA\n               He saw her eat his heart!\n                   (Fell likes that as much as\n                    she does)\n               Do you believe a man could become\n               so obsessed with a woman from a single\n               encounter?\n\n                          DR. FELL\n               Could he daily feel a stab of hunger\n               for her?  Find nourishment in the very\n               sight of her?  <i>I think so<\/i>.  But would\n               she see through the bars of <i>his<\/i> plight,\n               and ache for him?\n\n     Allegra waits for the answer, but Fell doesn't have it; he\n     just looks away wistfully as his fingers slide away from the\n     plastic like snakes.\n\n                          ALLEGRA\n               Thank you for this.\n\n     Fell's nod says, <i>I'm your servant.<\/i>  Pazzi pulls open the back\n     door of a cab.\n\n                          DR. FELL\n               <i>Commendatore.<\/i>\n                   (as he shakes Pazzi's hand)\n               A ...  lle ...  gra ...\n\n     It's all Pazzi can do to keep from arresting the man as he\n     watches Fell <u>rape<\/u> his wife with a kiss of her hand.  His head\n     stays down there longer than it should as he savors the aroma\n     emanating from her wrist.  Finally the head rises back up and\n     Pazzi all but shoves Allegra into the cab.  As Fell watches\n     after it driving away, a couple passes behind them.\n\n                          THEATERGOER\n               Let's get something to eat.\n\n                          DR.

He takes in the residue of the scent.\n\n     INT. STARLING'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT\n\n     Empty coffee cup and dinner debris on Starling's desk.\n     Sitting at her computer, she types in a code summoning the\n     FBI's private VICAP site.  Navigating deep into it with other\n     codes, she reaches a page with a query panel and types in -\n     \"cookies.\"\n\n     The screen fills with long lines of text - words and numbers\n     and slashes and hyphens - the \"fingerprints\" left by everyone\n     who has accessed the site over the last year.\n\n     Most have addresses within the FBI itself and Justice\n     Department; the majority of the rest from Interpol and other\n     internationl police organizations.  The scrolling list goes\n     on <i>forever<\/i>.\n\n     She narrows her search to show only those who have visited\n     the VICAP Lecter files, then narrows it further to those who\n     have \"knocked\" more than twenty times in the last month.\n\n     Her own screen name - \"cstarling\" - appears on the new list\n     more than any other.  There are also several flagged hits by\n     \"pkrendler.\"  She smiles at one name - \"jcrawford.\"  He isn't\n     supposed to be accessing the VICAP files anymore, now that\n     he's retired, but just can't help himself.\n\n     The next heaviest user is a name she doesn't recognize.\n     Someone who calls him or herself, \"pfrancesco.\"  She stares\n     long at the screen name and finally whispers to it -\n\n                          STARLING\n               Could that be you, Doctor?\n\n     EXT. CEMETERY - FLORENCE - NIGHT\n\n     We slowly approach - from someone's moving point of view -\n     a pair of young lovers walking toward us under the trees.  As\n     they draw closer - oblivious to us, and our breath, and our\n     footsteps on the cobblestone path -\n\n     <i>Pazzi<\/i> enters his own POV.  Once past the lovers, he takes\n     out a pencil-thin Maglite and rakes its narrow beam across\n     names on the chipped-marble tombstones he passes, the light\n     settling eventually on someone called \"Lorenzo Mametti.\"\n\n     He <i>tosses<\/i> a cheap bunch of wilting flowers onto the grave\n     and looks around for whoever it is he's supposed to be meet-\n     ing here.  A shadowy figure emerges almost soundlessly from\n     behind a crypt and Pazzi finds the face with his pen light.\n\n                          CARLO\n               <i>Please.<\/i>\n\n     Pazzi snaps it off.  Carlo comes out into the open looking\n     like a grave digger in his work clothes, perches on a squat\n     headstone, and first offering one to Pazzi, who declines,\n     lights himself a cigarette.\n\n                          CARLO\n               I want him in the open street with not\n               a lot of people around.\n\n                          PAZZI\n               How will you take him down?\n\n                          CARLO\n               That's my business.\n\n                          PAZZI\n               It's my business too.\n\n                          CARLO\n               You're a cop, aren't you.\n\n                          PAZZI\n               I asked you a question.\n\n                          CARLO\n               Yeah, you're a cop, all right.

Feet first.\n\n     INT. STARLING'S LECTEREUM - DAY\n\n     Starling glances from an international number jotted down on\n     her blotter to the phone on which she's dialing it.  A paused\n     time-coded frame of Lecter at the Florence perfumery, taking\n     in a scent on his hand, glows on her television as she\n     listens to a European ring.\n\n     INT.

He holds the receiver up, then cradles it.\n     Pazzi groans.  Keeps his coat on.  Lifts the receiver of\n     another phone near him and pushes the blinking light.\n\n                          PAZZI\n               Pazzi.\n\n                          STARLING'S VOICE\n               Inspector Pazzi, it's Agent Starling with\n               the FBI.

PALAZZO VECCHIO - LATER - EVENING\n\n     As the sky darkens, floodlights across the piazza blink on\n     and wash across the rough stone walls of the Palazzo Vecchio.\n     As bats fly out from the jack-o'-lantern teeth of the\n     parapets the image suddenly goes to -\n\n     BLACK AND WHITE - a security monitor in the foyer, on which\n     a guard watches the creatures circling the building looking\n     for darker quarters.\n\n     A clunking sound draws our attention, but not his, to the\n     stairs, where we briefly glimpse the bottom half of a hand\n     truck - with something big strapped to it - as it's pulled\n     with some effort up the top steps.\n\n     UPPER HALL\n\n     The hand truck is wheeling toward us now, along the long\n     hall, and we see that it is a lectern - as big as a pulpit -\n     strapped to it.  We watch it coming, and the worker pushing\n     it - that same man again, the Palazzo's custodian - into -\n\n     THE SALON OF LILIES\n\n     - where the restorers are climbing down from their\n     scaffolding, closing up their cans of spirits and paints,\n     packing up to leave for the day.\n\n     Metal folding chairs have been arranged on the drop cloths\n     covering the floor in split rows of six.  Fell is at a small\n     table in back of them, setting up a slide projector.  He\n     turns it on and angle its bright white light onto a home\n     movie screen draping off the arm of its metal stand.\n\n     He sees the custodian coming in with the hand truck and\n     points out to him that he'd like the lectern up front, to one\n     side of the screen.\n\n     The screen.  It's too small.  The projector light spilling\n     way wide of its edges.  The drop cloth hanging from the\n     scaffolding behind it would work much better.\n\n     As the custodian unstraps and sets up the lectern, Fell takes\n     down the little screen, sets it aside, and stands before the\n     cloth, smoothing at its flickering folds.\n\n     The last of the restorers straggles out.  The custodian\n     unplugs and coils the long orange cord of the floor polisher,\n     hand-over-elbow.  Fell adds a brown extension cord to the\n     projector remote and snakes it along the ersatz aisle between\n     the chairs to the lectern.\n\n     He sets some books on the podium, places his hands on its\n     sides to test the comfort of its height - it's satisfactory -\n     and looks out over his invisible audience.\n\n     The custodian is finished straightening up.  Fell watches\n     him cross behind the back row of folding chairs, approach the\n     open doorway, and pauses for a few moments - too <i>many<\/i> moments -\n     to gaze up at the Botticelli before leaving.\n\n     EXT. PALAZZO VECCHIO - NIGHT\n\n     A great shadow rears up against the floodlit wall.  It\n     belongs to Pazzi, as he crossed the piazza, glancing once to\n     Carlo and his brother Matteo smoking next to a van before\n     disappearing into the palazzo's front entrance.\n\n                          FELL'S VOICE\n               Avarice and hanging are linked in the\n               medieval mind -\n\n     INT. SALON OF LILIES - NIGHT\n\n     The \"dragons\" of the <i>Studiolo<\/i> - and Sogliato - face us in the\n     folding chairs, listening to the lecture -\n\n                          FELL'S VOICE\n               St. Jerome writes that Judas' very\n               surname - Iscariot - means 'money,' or\n               'price.'\n\n     A ringing phone interrupts.  The heads all turn.  Pazzi,\n     standing just inside the doors, gropes for his cell phone,\n     extracts it from his jacket pocket.\n\n                          FELL\n               Ah, <i>Commendatore<\/i> Pazzi.\n\n                          STARLING'S VOICE\n               It wasn't easy, but I got this number\n               <i>without<\/i> telling them why, Inspector Paz -\n\n     He hangs up on her.

You'll be interested in\n               this, <i>Commendatore<\/i>, since there is a\n               Pazzi already in Dante's <i>Inferno.<\/i>\n\n     An art slide appears on the drop cloth.  Fell improves the\n     focus with the remote.\n\n                          FELL\n               Here is the earliest known depiction\n               of the Crucifixion, carved on an ivory\n               box in Gaul about A.D.  Four Hundred.  It\n               includes the death by hanging of Judas,\n               his face upturned to the branch that\n               suspends him.\n                   (the slide changes)\n               And here he is, on the doors of the\n               Benevento Cathedral, hanging with his\n               bowels falling out as St. Luke the\n               physician described him in the Acts of\n               the Apostles - <u>still<\/u> looking up.\n\n     The shadow of a bat flies across the image, but everyone, so\n     accustomed to the occurence, ignores it.\n\n                          FELL\n               In this plate, from a fifteenth-\n               century edition of the Inferno, Pier\n               della Vigna's body hangs from a bleeding\n               tree.  I will not belabor the obvious\n               parallel with Judas Iscariot.\n\n     Pazzi, still in the back of the room, tries desperately to\n     separate the legs of a folding chair without having them\n     squeak.\n\n                          FELL\n               But Dante Alighieri needed no drawn\n               illustration.  It is his genius to make\n               Pier della Vigna, now in Hell, speak in\n               strained hisses and coughing sibilants as\n               though he is hanging still.  Listen as he\n               drags with the other damned his own dead\n               body to hang upon the thorn tree:\n\n     Fell's normally composed face pains as he recites from memory\n     Dante's words of the agonal Pier della Vigna -\n\n                          FELL\n               <i>Come l'altre verrem per nostre spoglie,\n               ma no pero ch'alcuna sen rivesta, che non\n               e giusto aver cio ch'om si toglie.\n               Qui le strascineremo, e per la mesta\n               selva saranno i nostri corpi appesi,\n               ciascuno al prun de l'ombra sua molesta.<\/i>\n\n     A single metallic squeak from the back of the room punctuates\n     the last word.\n\n                          FELL\n               Avarice, hanging, self-destruction,\n               with avarice counting as self-destruction\n               as much as hanging.

Pazzi has to step aside to keep from being knocked\n     over by Sogliato leaving.\n\n     The lights stay dimmed.  Pazzi makes his way to Fell and\n     waits, as an autograph-seeker waits, for the last of the fans\n     to shake the doctor's hand and step away.\n\n                          PAZZI\n               I'm not a scholar, but I think you've\n               got the job.

Yes, I'd like that.\n               I'll just be a minute gathering my\n               things.\n\n     As Fell takes his tomes from the lectern and carries them\n     back to the projector table, Pazzi switches the power back on\n     his cell phone.  Nothing happens.  He realizes he has pressed\n     the ring\/vibrate, not the power button, powers it up now and\n     makes a call.\n\n                          PAZZI\n               Allegra, cara, I'll be home just a\n               little later than I said.  I'm taking Dr.\n               Fell out for a drink.\n\n     INTERCUT Carlo, outside, watching the entry of the Palazzo.\n\n                          CARLO\n               I can see the people coming out now.\n\n     Back in the Salon, Pazzi hangs up.  Fell gathers his slides.\n\n                          FELL\n               Oh, I should've shown them this one.\n               I can't imagine how I missed it.  This\n               one will interest you.\n\n     He drops the slide in front of the projector bulb and the\n     image appears on the drop cloth:  a drawing of a man hanging\n     naked beneath the battlements of this palace, the Palazzo\n     Vecchio, from the exact same angle we saw on the security\n     monitor.\n\n                          FELL\n               Can you make it out all right?\n\n     It's a little blurry but Fell works with the remote and the\n     illustration passes back and forth across the plane of focus.\n     Keeping the remote in one hand, he takes a rag from his\n     satchel with the other, and approaches Pazzi, his silhouette\n     against on the drop cloth looming large as he comes.\n     \n                          FELL\n               There's a name down here, can you see it?\n\n     Pazzi comes close to look.  The projector's focusing motor\n     purrs as Fell works it with the remote.  The lettering\n     sharpens:  <i>Francesco Pazzi<\/i>.  Cheerfully -\n\n                          FELL\n               It's your ancestor, <i>Commendatore.<\/i>\n               Hanging beneath these very windows.

It comes down,\n     enveloping Pazzi.  Fell seizes him around the chest and\n     presses the ether-soaked rag over the canvas where Pazzi's\n     face must be - the image of his hanging ancestor splashed\n     across the wall under the scaffolding.\n\n     EXT. PALAZZO VECCHIO - NIGHT\n\n     At the back of the van, its doors open, Carlo unzips a black\n     vinyl guitar gig-bag.  Inside is his beanbag stun rifle.  He\n     sets it next to the case and leans past the side of the door\n     to check on his brother, Matteo, stationed across the piazza\n     at the far end of the palazzo.\n\n     From Matteo's position - if he were looking - he could\n     see that his brother Carlo would like him to pay attention.\n\n     Matteo <i>is<\/i> paying attention, only it's to a young couple in a\n     car parked in the shadows across the street, necking.\n\n     A <i>rock<\/i> hits Matteo's pant leg and he finally looks up to his\n     brother by the van, who is saying with the arm that threw the\n     rock, <i>What's the matter with you?<\/i>\n\n     Neither one of them pays any attention to the worker sitting\n     on the ledge of the fountain - the custodian from the Palazzo\n     Vecchio - who glances up from time to time from the tip of\n     his burning cigarette to the young lovers in the car.\n\n     INT. SALON OF LILIES - NIGHT\n\n     Pazzi's gun, his plastic handcuffs strips and his wallet sit\n     next to Fell's work permit and <i>permesso di soggiorno<\/i> on the\n     podium.\n\n     Fell himself is standing next to it, working the plug-end\n     of the long orange floor polisher cord into a hangman's noose\n     with the traditional thirteen wraps.  Finishing, he crosses\n     the room with it, the tail of the orange snake uncurling and\n     slithering after him.\n\n                          FELL\n               If you tell me what I need to know,\n               <i>Commendatore<\/i>, it would be convenient for\n               me to leave without my meal.  I'll ask\n               you questions and then we'll see.\n\n     Pazzi is cinched to the hand truck with the same canvas\n     straps used to secure the lecturn on its journey up to the\n     salon.  With his mouth taped, it's difficult for him to\n     express his gratitude.\n\n                          FELL\n               Was it Mason Verger you sold me to?\n               Blink twice for yes.  Yes.  Thank you.\n               Are his men waiting outside?  Umm hmmm.\n               And one of them smells like tainted boar\n               sausage?  Was that a single blink?  Oh,\n               now you're confused.  Try not to be\n               confused or I may have to fillet Signora\n               Pazzi after all.  Have you told anyone in\n               the Questura about me?  No, I thought\n               not.  Have you told A-lle-gra?  No.\n               You're sure?  I believe you.\n\n     Fell comes around behind Pazzi to the back of the hand truck,\n     hooks the cord-noose around one of its handles and gently\n     tips it back.\n\n                          FELL\n               Here we go.  Hold on.\n\n     Pazzi struggles against the straps.  He struggles to speak,\n     to beg, but all that comes past the tape over his mouth is a\n     purr.  Fell wheels him close to a balcony, fully uprights the\n     hand truck again, takes the noose from the handle, drapes it\n     delicately around Pazzi's neck and tightens the slack.\n\n                          FELL\n               Your heart is palpitating.

Instead he finds in there the cell phone.\n     It vibrates silently in Fell's hand.\n\n                          FELL\n               Who could that be?  Should I answer it?\n\n     Why not.

The\n     wall behind the scaffolding is still displaying the slide of\n     the hanging Francesco Pazzi.

One push and\n     the railing catches Pazzi at the waist.  He goes over it, the\n     orange cord trailing, the ground coming up in a rush, the\n     floor polisher yanked down and sliding across the floor,\n     gathering up the drop cloth and slamming against the railing.\n     Pazzi's neck snaps and his bowels, and phone, spill out.\n\n     EXT. PALAZZO VECCHIO - NIGHT\n\n     The lovers in the car break their embrace at the sound of the\n     phone clattering to the ground, and stare up into the face of\n     the palazzo custodian - <i>Il Mostro<\/i> - standing just outside the\n     windshield with a big knife in his hand.

PIAZZA VECCHIO - NIGHT\n\n     A crowd is gathering, peering up at the spectacle that is\n     Rinaldo Pazzi swaying slowly back and forth against the stone\n     walls, lit up as if in a stadium under the floodlights.\n\n     A motorcycle comes toward the square on a narrow side street.\n     A figure steps out into the glare of its headlight.  The\n     cyclist slows to a stop.\n\n                          LECTER\n               Young man, if I'm not at the Piazza\n               Bellosquardo in ten minutes, my wife will\n               kill me.\n\n     Lecter's gloved hand offers a 50,000-lira note.\n\n                          MOTORCYCLIST\n               That's all you want?  A ride?\n\n                          LECTER\n               That's all.\n\n     He hands the cyclist the bill and climbs on back, careful not\n     to touch the young man with his hands, lest he get the wrong\n     idea.  The Moto-Guzzi turns around and speeds off the way it\n     came, away from the piazza.\n\n     FADE TO BLACK\n\n     And out of the black materializes -\n\n     A BLACK AND WHITE image of Pazzi, small and stark in the\n     floodlights, swinging against the wall of the Palazzo\n     Vecchio.\n\n     INT. STARLING'S LECTEREUM - DAY\n\n     The event, captured on tape by the security camera across the\n     piazza, copied and sent by the Questura at her request, plays\n     on Starling's VCR setup.  As she watches it -\n\n     INT. VERGER'S CHAMBER - DAY\n\n     A copy of a copy of the tape - at the same point in the\n     action - plays for Verger.  Noticing something - some move-\n     ment in an upper corner of the frame - he reverse-searches\n     the tape with his remote to look at it again.\n\n     The movement belongs to a silhouette of a figure appearing\n     briefly on the balcony above the hanged Pazzi.  An arm of the\n     figure rises up and the hand waves - not down to Pazzi - but\n     across to the viewer.  Verger freezes the image and studies\n     it for a long moment in silence.  Eventually -\n\n                          MASON\n               Cordell?  To you:  Does that look like\n               a wave goodbye? ... Or hello?\n\n     INT. STARLING'S LECTEREUM - CONTINUED\n\n     Starling's copy of the tape frozen on the same frame.  She,\n     too, reverse-searches it and plays the wave again, no doubt\n     wondering the same thing Verger is.

Starling reaches behind his track suit, pulls out his\n     .38, and keeping the branch tight against his neck, lets the\n     other runner, who's running back now, know that she has his\n     friend's gun.  To him, again very calmly, as he nears -\n\n                          STARLING\n               Stop.  Catch your breath.

Then -\n\n                          STARLING\n               All right.  Who are you?\n\n                          2ND RUNNER\n               We work for Jack Crawford.  We're\n               supposed to keep an eye on you.  To keep\n               you safe from - you know - Hannibal the\n               Cannibal.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Show me.\n\n     He knows what that means, and shows her identification from\n     Crawford's private security firm.\n\n     She gets up off the other one then, tosses the branch away\n     and walks over to the gun resting on the fallen leaves.  She\n     picks it up.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Okay, here it is:  I don't need you\n               looking after me.  I'm not in any danger.\n               If you talk to him before I do tell him\n               that.\n\n                          2ND RUNNER\n               Yes, ma'am.\n\n     She returns the guns to each of them, first giving the one on\n     the ground a hand up.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Sorry if I hurt you.\n\n     She leaves them, continues on her run.  As the one she threw\n     to the ground dusts himself off, the perspective changes to -\n\n     A VIEW THROUGH BINOCULARS\n\n     - of the two private security men off in the distance.\n\n     They blur then as the binoculars are shifted.  Trees, too,\n     blur across the lenses.  The view overtakes Starling, returns\n     and follows her, focusing as she runs through the trees,\n     staying on her until she disappears down a sloping path.\n\n     Lecter lowers the small, expensive field glasses.  Returns\n     them to their case slung over his shoulder.  Crosses the dirt\n     parking area to her mustang.  Peers inside and sees no\n     blinking red light on the dash.\n\n     He takes out a slim jim.  Slips it down and across the\n     driver's side jamb, tripping the lock.  He opens the door\n     and sits in the bucket seat a long moment before delicately\n     touching the ten and two o'clock points on the leather-clad\n     steering wheel where her hands rest most often.  He leans\n     closer to smell her on the leather.  Then licks it.\n\n     INT. KRENDLER'S DC TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT\n\n     Krendler, just back from a jog himself, sweaty T-shirt and\n     headband, sits with Cordell and reads a postcard from London\n     sheathed in plastic, written in Lecter's distinctive copper-\n     plate.

Eventually -\n\n                          KRENDLER\n               It won't be pretty.\n\n                          MASON'S VOICE\n               What ever <i>is?<\/i>\n\n     INT. ASSISTANT DIRECTOR NOONAN'S OFFICE - DAY\n\n     Starling sits next to her boss, Pearsall, and across from\n     <i>his<\/i> boss, Noonan.

DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY\n\n     Lecter, clutching a shopping bag, stands in the electronics\n     department before a wall of television sets all tuned to the\n     same channel, local news, a talking head with an inset of a\n     photograph of Starling.\n\n                          TALKING HEAD\n               - relieved of field duty pending an\n               internal investigation into the charges.\n               Starling, a 7-year vetern on the Bureau\n               began her career with an assignment to\n               interview lethal madman, Hannibal Lecter -\n\n                          LECTER\n               - Doctor -\n\n                          SALES CLERK\n               May I help you, sir?\n\n     Lecter glances to the young sales clerk, a teenager with a\n     name tag.\n\n                          LECTER\n               I <i>was<\/i> looking for some good steak knives,\n               Toby, but I'm afraid I got distracted.\n\n                          SALES CLERK\n               Kitchenware, right over there.\n\n                          LECTER\n               Thank you.\n\n     The clerk walks away.

But I want to say\n               this:  Starling's one of the best agents\n               we have and having known her for a number\n               of years now, I would be <i>very<\/i> surprised\n               if the accusations turn out to be true.\n               It's much too soon to condemn her.\n\n     Lecter smiles at Krendler's image.

Officer Starling is\n               a deep roller, Barney.  We should hope\n               one of her parents was not.\n\n     The tape reaches its leader an stops.  The green power\n     light stays on.  Then it goes off, then comes back on again:\n     an electrical interruption that is quickly reestablished.\n\n     INT. BASEMENT - STARLING'S HOUSE - SAME TIME\n\n     A basement window slightly open.  A piece of insulated wire\n     clipped to the alarm contacts.  A shadow of a figure floating\n     away from it.\n\n     The figure moves toward the stairs, passing a rusty bicycle\n     hanging on the wall and some shooting trophies gathering dust\n     on a shelf, and begins up the stairs.\n\n     INT. STARLING'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER\n\n     The microwave oven's glowing reset numbers \"88:88\" are\n     obsured a moment as the figure soundlessly passes.  Ice\n     tumbles from the refrigerator's ice-maker into the bin.\n\n     In the living room, Starling is still asleep, her empty\n     glass resting on a wood coffee table.\n\n     A digital desk clock blinks \"00:00.\"  Tiny sounds echo in the\n     dark house - the hum of the furnace, the whistle of a pant\n     leg touching fabric on a chair, slick pages being turned ...\n     a sigh.\n\n     EXT. STARLING'S HOUSE - DAWN\n\n     The basement window, closed now, reflecting the glow of\n     sunrise.  Power lines against the red sky.  A pigeon sitting\n     on the wire, calling out once.\n\n     INT. STARLING'S HOUSE - DAWN\n\n     Starling wakes in the same position she fell asleep.  In\n     front of her is her empty glass.  Set down not on top of the\n     wood as she left it, <i>but on a thick magazine.<\/i>\n\n     She knows that's not right.  Sits up enough to see the\n     cover of the magazine.  Italian <i>Vogue<\/i>.  Edge of a <i>Post-It<\/i>\n     peeking out from the pages.  She uses the Post-It to turn\n     to the marked page.  A glossy Prada advertisement for\n     expensive - unsensible - shoes.\n\n     He's been in her house.  Right here as she slept.  She's up\n     fast, rushing to her bedroom.  The the closet.  Pulling down\n     from the top shelf the box containing Brigham's guns and ID.\n     \n     She slams a clip into the .45.  As she's loading the little\n     .38, the phone rings, startling her.  She stares at it on the\n     night stand next to the alarm clock:  10:30 A.M.  It rings\n     again.  She slowly crosses toward it.  Another ring.  She\n     lifts the receiver.  Says nothing.  Hears nothing.  Until -\n\n                          RECORDED VOICE\n               If you're not receiveing frequent flyer\n               miles on <i>your<\/i> credit card, you're missing\n               out on -\n\n     She hangs up.  Returns to loading the gun.  The cell phone\n     on her <i>hip<\/i> rings, and a bullet falls to the floor.  She pulls\n     the phone from its holster.  Answers it, again, by saying\n     nothing.  Only listens.  Hears a little static.  Connection\n     to another cell phone probably.  Then -\n\n                          LECTER'S VOICE\n               The power on that battery is low,\n               Clarice.  I would've changed it, but I\n               didn't want to wake you.  You're going to\n               have to use the other one.  In the\n               charger.  Hopefully the light on it is\n               green by now.\n\n     The charger is right in front of her on the dresser.  And the\n     light on it <i>is<\/i> green - fully charged.\n\n                          LECTER'S VOICE\n               - because this is going to be a long\n               call and I can't let you off because -\n               even though you've been <i>stripped<\/i> of your\n               duties, I know you won't <i>abandon<\/i> them,\n               you'll try to put on a trace.  So we'll\n               disconnect only long enough for you to\n               exchange the battery in the phone for the\n               one in the charger.  Shall we say - three\n               seconds?  That should be enough.  You can\n               change the clip on a .45 quicker than\n               that.  So when I tell you to, disengage\n               the dying battery.  That'll disconnect\n               us.  I'll speed dial back.  If you've\n               succeeded in your task in the allotted\n               time - <i>wonderful.<\/i>  If not? Well maybe\n               some other time.  Are you ready?\n\n                          STARLING\n               Yes.\n\n                          LECTER'S VOICE\n               Go.\n\n     It <i>looks<\/i> like changing the clip in a gun - the low battery\n     falling away from the body of the phone into her hand, the\n     charged one slapped in its place in just over two seconds.\n     She hits the power button.  The LCD display lights up and\n     beeps.  The phone rings and she flips it open.\n\n                          LECTER'S VOICE\n               <i>Very<\/i> good.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Thank you.\n\n                          LECTER'S VOICE\n               Get in your car.\n\n     She begins gathering the guns and holsters and ammo.\n\n                          LECTER'S VOICE\n               Oh, all right, bring the guns if you\n               want.  But remember, if you get caught\n               with a concealed, unlicensed firearm in\n               the District of Columbia, the penalty\n               is pretty stiff.\n\n     INT. STARLING'S MUSTANG - MOVING - DAY\n\n     She's in the far right lane of a highway.  Keeping just under\n     the speed limit.  The cell phone rests atop the open ashtray.\n\n                          LECTER'S VOICE\n               The reason we're doing it like this,\n               Clarice, is because I'd like to see you\n               as we speak.  With your eyes open.  No,\n               it doesn't <i>excite<\/i> me.  Yes, it pleases\n               me.  You have very shapely feet.\n               Call it out.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Exit 14-A.  Three hundred yards - two\n               hundred - one hundred - fifty -\n\n                          LECTER'S VOICE\n               Take it.\n\n     She veers onto the ramp without a signal.  A van, several\n     lengths back, takes the exit, too.\n\n     INT. UNION STATION - DAY\n\n     Starling enters the huge, echoing interior of the station\n     with a crush of travelers and Christmas shoppers.  She has\n     the phone to her ear, and through it, can hear the sounds not\n     dissimilar to those around her.\n\n                          LECTER'S VOICE\n               I thought, to begin, you might tell me\n               how you're feeling.\n\n                          STARLING\n               About what?\n\n                          LECTER'S VOICE\n               The masters you serve and how they've\n               treated you.  Your <i>career<\/i>, such as it is.\n               Your <i>life<\/i>, Clarice.\n\n     The place is not just trains, but also a mall of stores, many\n     of them playing Christmas music.  Outside one of them, on the\n     second tier, Lecter, cell phone to <i>his<\/i> ear, watches Starling\n     trying to sort out the cacophony of sounds down below.\n\n                          STARLING'S VOICE\n               I thought we might talk about <i>yours<\/i>.\n\n                          LECTER\n               Mine?  What is there to say about mine?\n               I'm happy.  Healthy.  A <i>little<\/i> nomadic at\n               the moment but that'll soon change.  You,\n               though.  You, I'm worried about.\n\n     Carlo and Piero, <i>without<\/i> phones, have entered the building\n     and brush past people as they scan its interior, looking for\n     and eventually spotting Starling rising up an escalator.\n\n                          STARLING\n               I'm fine.\n\n                          LECTER'S VOICE\n               No, you're not.  You fell in love with\n               the Bureau - with <i>The Institution<\/i> - only\n               to discover, after giving it everything -\n               that it doesn't love you back.  That it\n               resents you, more than the husband and\n               children you gave up to it ever would.\n\n     Lecter is going <i>down<\/i> an escalator as Starling approaches\n     where he was just moments ago, outside the Gap Kids store.\n\n                          LECTER\n               Why is that, do you think?  Why are you\n               so resented?\n\n                          STARLING'S VOICE\n               Tell me.\n\n                          LECTER\n               Tell you?  Isn't it clear?  You serve\n               the idea of order, Clarice - they don't.\n               You believe in the oath you took - they\n               don't.  You feel it's your duty to\n               protect the sheep - they don't.  They\n               don't <i>like<\/i> you because they're <i>not<\/i> like\n               you.  They're weak and unruly and\n               believe in nothing.\n\n     She's lost him.  Peers down over the railing.  Listens to the\n     background sounds in her phone.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Mason Verger wants to kill you, Dr.\n               Lecter.  Turn yourself in to me and I\n               promise no one will hurt you.\n\n                          LECTER'S VOICE\n               Will you stay with me in my prison cell?\n               Hmmm?  I suppose it wouldn't be <i>that<\/i> much\n               worse than yours.\n\n     She hears a bell clanging.  Sees a Salvation Army \"soldier\"\n     in the far distance below, his back to her, his arm moving up\n     and down, but can't tell if it synchronizes with the sound in\n     her phone.\n\n                          LECTER'S VOICE\n               Mason doesn't want to <i>kill<\/i> me, Clarice,\n               any more than I wanted to kill him.  He\n               wants me to suffer in some - <i>unimaginable<\/i>\n               way.  He's rather twisted, you know.\n               Always has been.

But back to you -\n\n     She steps off the <i>down<\/i> escalator and heads toward the\n     Salvation Army soldier and his little kettle hanging from the\n     tripod, the bell in her phone diminishing proportionally, it\n     seems, as she nears the live one.\n\n                          LECTER'S VOICE\n               I want to know what it is you think you\n               will do, now that all you cared about in\n               the world is gone.  Will you work as a\n               chambermaid at a motel on Route 66, like\n               <i>Mom?<\/i>\n\n                          STARLING\n               I don't know, Dr. Lec -\n\n                          LECTER'S VOICE\n               Don't you want to <i>harm<\/i> those who have\n               forced you to consider it?

To\n               want to <i>taste<\/i> the enemy.\n\n     She stops moving.  Listens.  Hears <i>Jingle Bells<\/i> in her phone.\n\n                          LECTER'S VOICE\n               Are you thinking?  Or <i>tracking<\/i>, Ex-\n               Special Agent Starling?\n\n     <i>Jingle Bells<\/i> begins to fade in her phone.  He's moving again.\n     She turns.  Carlo and Piero do an abrupt about-face.  But not\n     before Starling sees them.\n\n                          STARLING\n               They're following me, Dr. Lecter.\n\n                          LECTER'S VOICE\n               I know.  I see them.  Now you're in a\n               real dilemma, aren't you?\n               Do you continue to try to find me,\n               knowing that you're <i>leading<\/i> them to me?\n               Do you have so much faith in your\n               abilites that you believe you could\n               somehow - <i>simultaneously<\/i> - arrest me -\n               <i>and<\/i> them?  It could get messy, Clarice.\n               Like Memphis.\n\n     She can hear another voice - both \"live\" and in the phone -\n     \"Ho, Ho, Ho, Merry Christmas\" - and can see above heads in\n     the distance, a department store Santa Claus in a painted\n     plywood sleigh.  She moves toward him.\n\n                          LECTER'S VOICE\n               What if I did it for you?\n\n                          STARLING\n               Did what?\n\n                          LECTER'S VOICE\n               <i>Harmed<\/i> them, Clarice.

Forget I said it.\n\n     She's closing in on the sleigh and the barricade of kids and\n     parents around it, her free hand settling on the stock of her\n     .45, Carlo and Piero closing with her several steps back.\n\n                          SANTA CLAUS\n               Ho - Ho - Ho.\n\n     Lecter sees her and the Sardinians pushing through the crowd.\n\n                          LECTER\n               Ho, ho, ho, indeed.  I think I'll be\n               going now.  I have some shopping to do\n               anyway.  Chin up, Clarice.  Merry\n               Christmas.\n\n     He disconnects the call.  Starling breaks through the front\n     of the crowd, moving just in front of the sleigh to scan the\n     faces all around her.  Lecter is gone.\n\n     EXT. D.C. DOWNTOWN - DAY\n\n     Traffic crawls past Christofle.\n\n     INT. CHRISTOFLE - DAY\n\n     An armed security guard's glance drifts across Lecter\n     pointing out to a saleswoman the Gien French china he'd like\n     to purchase.\n\n     Later, she rings up several purchases as Lecter looks on,\n     credit card out:  the plates, a set of aperitif glasses and\n     Riedel crystal, linen place mats and napkins, 19th-century\n     silverware with a pleasing heft like good dueling pistols.\n\n     INT. HAMMACHER SCHLEMMER - DAY\n\n     Lecter chooses a set of exquisite copper saute pans and a\n     couple of whisks.  Elsewhere, a salesman demonstrates for him\n     the adjustable height of the flame on a portable 35,000 BTU\n     stainless stell grill.\n\n     INT. MEDICAL SUPPLY STORE - DAY\n\n     And finally, to complete his <i>batterie de cuisine<\/i>, he pays for\n     a newly-new Stryker autopsy saw.\n\n     EXT. CHESAPEAKE BAY - EVENING\n\n     A late-model, but not new, Ford Ranger pickup pulls into\n     the driveway of a small yet charming cottage nestled in the\n     woods.\n\n     Lecter climbs out and gathers his bungy-corded shopping bags\n     from the truck bed, including the one with the distinctive\n     powder blue coloring.\n\n     He leaves the boxed Parker grill in back, at least for the\n     moment, carries the rest of his purchases to the front door,\n     fiddles with the lock to get it open and disappears inside.\n\n     INT. STARLING'S HOUSE - EVENING\n\n     Light bleeds along the edges of a scanner.  Images appear\n     on Starling's computer screen:  Brigham's FBI identification\n     next to a photo-booth picture of her.  Using a paint-program,\n     she replaces his photo with hers and prints it out.\n\n     INT. WINE STORE - ANNAPOLIS - DAY\n\n     As a wine merchant leans slightly to take a closer look at\n     Starling's new ID, laminated now, she closes its leatherette\n     holder.  Christmas Muzak plays softly from somewhere.\n\n                          STARLING\n               You're sure it was Chateau d'Y quem.\n\n                          WINE MERCHANT\n               Not only was it Chateau d'Y quem, it was\n               Chateau d'Y quem - <i>sixty-seven<\/i>.  The best\n               bottle of wine in the store.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Can I see the tape?  If his car was\n               parked out front, you may have caught the\n               license plate.\n\n     EXT. STREET - ANNAPOLIS - SAME TIME\n\n     The rear license plate of the Ford Ranger.  10-foot Noble\n     Christmas tree in back.  The pickup parked across the street\n     from the shopping center the wine store is part of.\n\n     Behind the windshield, Lecter carefully surveys the people\n     and vehicles in the large parking lot and those appearing and\n     disappearing in his side and rearview mirrors, well aware\n     that one of them could contain the Sardinians.\n\n     INT. WINE STORE - CONTINUED\n\n     Starling has come behind the counter to join the merchant as\n     he fast-forwards through a security tape on a small black and\n     white monitor.\n\n     EXT. STREET - CONTINUED\n\n     Still in his truck, Lecter watches the parking lot across\n     the street.  He watches the trunk lid of a yellow cab spring\n     open and the driver setting his elderly fare's grocery bags\n     into it.  He watches a man struggling to twine a big Douglas\n     fir to the roof of a sub-compact that's too small for it.  He\n     watches a rolling, rattling cart without anyone attached to\n     it.\n\n     INT. WINE STORE - CONTINUED\n\n     Starling watches the fuzzy video tape.  Watches the man come\n     in wearing a parka and mittens and a billed cap pulled low\n     enough to hide his face, but can't make out the license\n     plates on the cars parked outside.\n\n     EXT. STREET \/ PARKING LOT - SAME TIME\n\n     Lecter puts the same hat on, unlatches his door, climbs\n     down.  He crosses the street to the lot and walks past parked\n     cars, a box in his hand wrapped in Christmas angels paper.\n\n     INT. WINE STORE - CONTINUED\n\n     The video tape shows the wine merchant returning from the\n     back room, wiping dust from a bottle and displaying its label\n     to the man in the billed hat.

Up ahead about a quarter mile, in the\n     trees, she can see the glare of a floodlight.\n\n     She stops.  Pulls the trunk release.  Climbs out and comes\n     around to it.  Rummages around the debris inside and selects\n     four pairs of cuffs, extra ammo, a knife and a flashlight.\n\n     She leaves the trunk ajar, aims the flashlight down, switches\n     it on and leads herself with its beam - careful to keep it no\n     more than two or three steps ahead - into the woods.\n\n     INT.

She continues on\n     again toward the floodlit area beyond the trees until another\n     sound stops her.  Another recorded voice.  Begging and\n     screaming in Italian.\n\n     Suddenly, through the trees all around her, dark shapes are\n     moving fast.  She wants to but dares not point the flashlight\n     at them; if they're armed, the beam may as well be a painted\n     target on her chest.\n\n     She crouches.

Carlo rights the hand\n     truck, hooks a saline bag to it, and wheels it toward the\n     slatted gate.

As he takes a\n     bottle of cheap Chianti from the bag, he notices a simple\n     strand of Christmas lights around a window.  Doesn't remember\n     hanging them.  Stares, cocking his head the way he does.\n\n                          LECTER'S VOICE\n               Oh, good, you brought wine.\n\n     Before Krendler can turn, his mouth is covered with an ether-\n     soaked dish towel.\n\n     INT. KRENDLER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\n     Starling's eyes open and slowly take in her surroundings:\n     the small, unfamiliar room, the bed she's in, the night stand\n     and the empty morphine vials on it, the silver tray with the\n     crumpled bullet on <i>it.<\/i>\n\n     She eases the blanket down enough to see her T-shirt, eases\n     the T-shirt up enough to see the bandage, ease the bandage\n     away enough to see the stitched gunshot wound.\n\n     She hears quiet Christmas music and muffled voices from\n     elsewhere in the house.  Two men speaking in conversational\n     tones.  She drags herself from the bed, steadies herself,\n     slowly crosses the room to, and down, a hallway.\n\n     At the end of it, she see:  A decorated Christmas tree.\n     An archway to a dining room, candles on the dining table.\n     Krendler, in his running clothes and sweatband, sitting at\n     the head of it.  Lecter, standing beside a portable grill on\n     a service cart, stirring at a saute pan with a wooden spoon.\n\n                          KRENDLER\n               Are those shallots?\n\n                          LECTER\n               Ummm.  And caper berries.\n\n                          KRENDLER\n               The butter smells wonderful.\n\n     Starling glances from Krendler's face to his hands.  He\n     doesn't seem to notice or care that they're duct-taped to the\n     arms of a wheelchair.\n\n     INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n\n     Back in the bedroom, Starling uses her teeth to strip the\n     4-pin telephone wire that's been yanked from the wall jack.\n\n     INT. DINING ROOM - SAME TIME\n\n     As Lecter executes a modest flambe with a little brandy -\n\n                          LECTER\n               I hope you're hungry, Paul.\n\n                          KRENDLER\n               Very.  What's the main course?\n\n                          LECTER\n               Oh, you never ask.  It spoils the\n               surprise.\n\n     Lecter notices, but seems unconcerned, as the line-light\n     blinks on a telephone.\n\n     INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUED\n\n     Starling searches drawers for some kind of weapon as she\n     whispers into the phone -\n\n                          STARLING\n               I don't have the address, but I <i>think<\/i>\n               the house belongs to the hostage, whose\n               name is Paul Krendler -\n\n                          911 OPERATOR\n               I have it from the phone number.  Now\n               if you can <i>safely<\/i> do it, get out of the\n               house.  Otherwise, stay on the line where\n               you are.  The response time should be ten\n               minutes.  I'm putting you on hold for\n               just a moment.\n\n     Starling hears an unusual sound from the other room, but\n     not <i>so<\/i> unusual that she doesn't recognize it:  It's the whir\n     of an autopsy saw.  She sets the receiver on the bed and -\n\n                          911 OPERATOR\n               I'm back.  Ma'am - ?\n\n     The phone goes dead as Starling yanks the 25-foot cord from\n     the wall and wraps it quickly around her hand, taking it with\n     her, perhaps to use as a garrote, as she leaves the room.\n\n     INT. HALL \/ DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER\n\n     She's moving along the hall again.  Hears the whir of the\n     saw grinding through - <i>something<\/i> - then stop.  She picks up a\n     heavy glass paperweight from a bookcase shelf and conceals it\n     in her hand.\n\n     She reaches the doorway to the living room and adjacent\n     dining area.  Sees Lecter straightening Krendler's sweatband.\n     The doctor glances up and regards her calmly.\n\n                          LECTER\n               Clarice.  What are you doing up?\n               You should be resting.  Get back to bed.\n\n                          STARLING\n               I'm hungry.\n\n     Krendler's head slowly turns to follow her as she crosses\n     into the dining room unsteadily.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Hello, Paul.\n\n     He doesn't respond.  He seems in some kind of trance.\n\n                          LECTER\n               Paul.  Don't be rude.  Say hello to\n               Agent Starling.\n\n                          KRENDLER\n               Hello, Starling.  I always wanted to\n               watch you eat.\n\n     As Lecter lays out another place setting of fine china (but\n     not silverware) for Starling, she sees the spent syringe and\n     the autopsy saw on a trivet next to the butane grill.\n\n                          LECTER\n               Would you like to say grace?\n\n                          KRENDLER\n               Me?  Grace?  Okay.\n\n     He bows his head.  Starling and Lecter don't.  She glances to\n     the twisting pendulum of a hurricane clock.  The doctor just\n     smiles faintly, well aware of the response time.\n\n                          KRENDLER\n               Father, we thank thee for the blessings\n               we are about to receive and dedicate them\n               to Thy mercy.  Forgive us all, even white\n               trash like Starling here, and bring her\n               into my service.  Amen.\n\n     As his head comes back up, a single rivulet of blood drips\n     out from under the sweatband.  Lecter stirs at his <i>beurre-\n     noisette.<\/i>\n\n                          LECTER\n               Paul, I have to tell you, the <i>Apostle<\/i>\n               Paul couldn't have done better.  He hated\n               women, too.\n\n     Krendler smiles rather stupidly at Starling.  As much as she\n     hates him, she doesn't want to see what she <i>thinks<\/i> Lecter has\n     in store for him, and tries to forestall it with conversation\n     and requests -\n\n                          STARLING\n               May I have some wine?\n\n                          LECTER\n               I don't think that's a good idea,\n               Clarice.  Not with the morphine.  Better\n               you should have some broth.\n\n     Lecter sets about ladling her and Krendler tureens of it.\n\n                          KRENDLER\n               By the way, Starling, that was a job\n               offer I worked into the blessing.  I'm\n               going to Congress, you know.\n\n                          STARLING\n               <i>Are<\/i> you?\n\n                          KRENDLER\n               Come around campaign headquarters.\n               You could be an office girl.  Can you\n               type and file?  Can you take dictation?\n               Take this down:  Washington is full of\n               cornpone country pussy.\n\n                          STARLING\n               I already took that down.  You said it\n               before.\n\n                          LECTER\n               Paul.  Please.  Now you are being rude.\n               Drink your broth.\n\n     As Lecter puts a straw in the tureen to Krendler's lips\n     and whispers something in his ear, Starling eyes the sharper\n     utensils on the other side of the table next to the grill.\n\n                          KRENDLER\n               This soup's not very good.\n\n                          LECTER\n               I admit I added a little something extra\n               to yours.  Perhaps it's clashing with the\n               cumin.  I assure you, though, you'll <i>love<\/i>\n               the second course, that is if I can serve\n               it before Clarice bashes my head in.\n\n     He commands her to show him what's in the hand in her lap\n     with a smile and a slight tip of his head.  She obeys,\n     setting the paperweight weapon on the table.\n\n                          KRENDLER\n               Hey, that's mine.\n\n     Lecter rakes it across to him with a folk like a croupier.\n     As Krendler shakes it and watches snow fall on the Capital\n     building, he's oblivious to Lecter taking off his sweatband\n     revealing the neat incision carved all the way around.\n\n     Starling can do little more than we can as Lecter <i>lifts\n     the top of Krendler's head off<\/i> - staring in disbelief at the\n     pinky-gray dome of Krendler's exposed brain.  Lecter reaches\n     for a set of tonsil spoons as the butter in the saute pan\n     sizzles to a golden brown.\n\n                          STARLING\n               I really would like some wine.\n\n     Lecter, poised over Krendler's brain with the tongs, looks at\n     her disapprovingly.  She's holding out her empty glass like\n     Oliver as the pendulum twists back and forth.\n\n                          LECTER\n               All right.  But just a little.\n\n     He sets the spoons down.  Pours some Chateau d'Y quem into\n     her glass as he glances to the twisting pendulum.\n\n                          LECTER\n               Unlike Paul, I unfortunately can't\n               offer you a job in government.  But I <i>am<\/i>\n               curious.  What will you do now?\n\n     <i>Right<\/i> now her hand is slowly inching across the tablecloth\n     toward a serrated knife.  Lecter picks it up and one of the\n     tongs and deftly severs the thalamus of Krendler's brain -\n\n                          STARLING\n               Doctor Lec -\n\n                          LECTER\n               You certainly can't return to the\n               bureau.  Not that you'd want to.  Even\n               if you <i>could<\/i> convince them to take you\n               back after all this, the Stain of Rein-\n               statement would never go away.\n\n     Krendler's eyes look up as if to see what's going on, then\n     follow Lecter's hands as he sets his prefrontal lobe in the\n     saute pan.\n\n                          KRENDLER\n               What did you say?\n\n                          STARLING\n               I didn't say anything.\n\n                          KRENDLER\n               I had plans for that smart mouth, but\n               I'd <i>never<\/i> hire you now.  Who gave you an\n               appointment anyway?\n\n     Lecter picks up the tongs again to scoop out another lobe.\n\n                          LECTER\n               The brain itself feels no pain, Clarice,\n               if that concerns you.  And Paul certainly\n               won't miss <i>this<\/i> - the prefrontal lobe is\n               the seat of manners.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Dr. Lecter, your profile at the border\n               stations has five features.  I'll trade\n               you.  Stop now and I'll tell you what\n               they are.\n\n                          LECTER\n               Trade?  How does that word taste to you,\n               Clarice?  Cheap and metallic like sucking\n               on a greasy coin to me.  Your soup is\n               getting cold.\n\n     He spoons out a second lobe and stirs it into the pan -\n\n                          KRENDLER\n               That smells <i>great.<\/i>\n\n                          LECTER\n               Have a taste, Paul.\n\n     He slides a taste of the \"second course\" onto a small plate,\n     forks a piece and slips it into Krendler's open mouth.\n\n                          KRENDLER\n               Ummm, it <i>is<\/i> good.\n\n                          STARLING\n               Dr. Lec -\n\n                          LECTER\n               No, I think a new life lies before you.\n               A better life.  With me?  Hmmm, there's a\n               thought.\n\n     Is he <i>serious?<\/i>  He seems to be.  Krendler glances stupidly\n     from him to her and back again.\n\n                          LECTER\n               I came halfway around the world just to\n               watch you run in the woods.

Don't get up, Paul will help me\n               clear.\n\n     As Lecter pushes Krendler toward the kitchen, he glimpses\n     on the way the headlights of a line of cars coming silently\n     along the shoreline.\n\n                          LECTER\n               Think about what I said, but <i>don't<\/i> drink\n               any more wine while you do.  Doctor's\n               orders.\n\n     As soon as the door to the kitchen swings shut, she gets\n     up, too fast, almost faints, sits back down.  Listening for a\n     moment to the scraping of plates, she tries again to stand,\n     slower this time.  she blows out a candle, grasps the stem of\n     the heavy brass holder and with it and the phone cord, slowly\n     crosses toward the closed kitchen door.\n\n     She slowly eases it open, revealing:  Lecter, his back to\n     her, <i>scraping the leftovers into Krendler's head<\/i> and setting\n     the plates neatly in the dishwasher.  He closes its door then\n     and switches it on, and, keeping his back to her, begins\n     wiping down the counters with a dish towel.\n\n     She eases past the door, gripping the heavy candlestick, and\n     slowly approaches Lecter from behind, grateful for the hum of\n     the dishwasher that covers the creaking of the floorboards.\n\n     Krendler is staring right at her as he shakes his Capital\n     paperweight.  She places a finger to her lips to tell him not\n     to speak, and he glances away to the tiny falling snow.\n\n                          KRENDLER\n               <i>Would you like to swing on a star -\n               Carry moonbeams home in a jar -<\/i>\n\n     The candlestick comes up and hangs there - as if Starling\n     isn't entirely sure she wants to crack Lecter's skull open -\n     but then it does come down hard right at his head, and -\n\n     Turning, he catches her wrist in his hand and pushes her\n     roughly against the refrigerator, toppling the wheelchair and\n     Krendler, the rest of his brain and some leftovers spilling\n     onto the floor.  Lecter holds Starling firmly in his grip,\n     staring at her, intending, it appears, to kill her.  But\n     then, quietly -\n\n                          LECTER\n               <i>That's<\/i> my girl.  If you hadn't tried,\n               I would have killed you ...

He grabs her wrists again, pushes her back up against\n     the fridge, opens it enough to catch her pnytail in the door\n     and shoves the candlestick through the side-by-side handles.\n\n                          LECTER\n               Oh, Clarice, you <i>are<\/i> the honey in the\n               lion.

THE COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER\n\n     Starling comes slowly out onto the porch.  Looks for\n     movement in the dark shapes of the trees across the road and\n     sees none.  Looks out across the Chesapeake and sees nothing\n     in its dark water - except that the little rowboat, once\n     tied to the dock, is now gone.\n\n     Feeling faint again - or just <i>tired of it all<\/i> - she sits on\n     the porch swing, slows her breathing and the pounding of her\n     heart, listens to the creak of the chains and the growl of\n     the approaching police cars, and watches the glare of the\n     approaching headlights play across the dark trees of the\n     forest ...\n\n                                      DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     A VERMEER\n\n     hanging in a gallery.  Foreign museum visitors strolling\n     past, giving it a glance before moving on.  One man, though,\n     seems unable to get enough of it, standing before it as if\n     before a shrine as the others keep moving past.  It's\n     Barney.  The painting, <i>Woman Holding the Balance<\/i> -\n\n                                     DISSOLVES TO:\n\n     A RECLINING WOMAN\n\n     asleep on a blanket on a beach.  Starling.  A beach ball\n     and a Walkman resting beside her.  The cord runs up across\n     the scar on her exposed midriff to a light pair of head-\n     phones.  Instead of music, she hears static, before -\n\n                          MAN V\/O\n               How are you covering yourself?\n\n                          WOMAN V\/O\n               Polaroids, monkey business, and none of\n               your business.  I'm not going to run.\n               One-point-five-mil, Ricky, flat fee.\n\n     The conversation is overtaken by static again.  Keeping her\n     eyes closed, Starling nudges the beach ball and the voices of\n     the man and woman, just two tiny figures waist deep in the\n     Miami beach surf, reemerge from the static -\n\n                          WOMAN V\/O\n               No discussion.  Just yes or no.\n\n                          MAN V\/O\n               Yes.  We'll make the transfer at the\n               Sun Trust conference room in the vault.\n               I'll bring my lockbox, you bring yours.\n\n     A beachcomber passes, walking along the wet sand between\n     Starling on the beach and the couple in the water.  Crawford.\n     In the headphones Starling hears -\n\n                          CRAWFORD V\/O\n               And we'll join the party, too.  That's\n               it, Starling.  You just made us our ten\n               percent.  And all you had to do was put\n               on sun screen.\n\n     She smiles without opening her eyes.  Reaches down out of\n     habit to adjust her top to cover the scar.\n\n                          CRAWFORD V\/O\n               You don't need to hide it.  Your doctor\n               did a nice job.  You can hardly see it -\n\n     The roar of a jet covers his last word -\n\n                                      DISSOLVE TO:\n\n     A RECLINING SLEEPING BOY\n\n     in a darkened 747 cabin, window shades down, movie\n     flickering.  Stewardesses move down the aisle gathering the\n     last of the lunch trays.\n\n     Sitting in coach next to the sleeping six year old boy,\n     Lecter, in Toronto Maple Leafs sweats, waits until he's sure\n     no one is looking at him, then, careful not to wake the boy,\n     reaches down under the seat in front of him, finds a box\n     and sets it on his lap.\n\n     It's from Dean & DeLuca.  Tied with a ribbon.  Lecter unknots\n     it.  Opens the lid.  Inside are Anatolian figs, pate de foie\n     gras, a half-bottle of St. Estephe and some silverware.\n     \n                          BOY\n               What's that?\n\n     Lecter sighs.  Then turns to the boy and makes a smile.\n\n                          LECTER\n               Which?\n\n                          BOY\n               That.\n\n                          LECTER\n               Liver.\n\n                          BOY\n               What are those?\n\n                          LECTER\n               Figs.\n\n                          BOY\n               And that?\n\n     Something in a plastic container.\n\n                          LECTER\n               That I don't think you'd like.\n\n                          BOY\n               It looks good.\n\n                          LECTER\n               It <i>is<\/i> good.\n\n                          BOY\n               Can I have some?\n\n                          LECTER\n               You're a very unusual boy, aren't you?\n\n                          BOY\n               I didn't eat what <i>they<\/i> gave me.\n\n                          LECTER\n               Nor <i>should<\/i> you have.  It's not even food,\n               as I understand the definition.  Which is\n               why I always travel with my own.\n                   (the boy smiles; Lecter\n                    smiles)\n               Are you sure your mother wouldn't\n               disapprove of your accepting food from\n               a stranger?\n\n                          BOY\n               She would.\n\n                          LECTER\n               Ah, but she's <i>asleep.<\/i>\n\n     The boy's eyebrows lift conspiratorially.\n\n                          LECTER\n               Which would you like to try?\n\n     The boy points to the plastic container.\n\n                          LECTER\n               This?\n\n     The boy nods.  Lecter thinks about it.  Finally -\n\n                          LECTER\n               I suppose it's all right.  After all,\n               as I'm sure your mother tells you - <i>mine<\/i>\n               certainly did:  It <i>is<\/i> important to always\n               try new things.\n\n     As Lecter dips his fork into the appetizer and feeds it to\n     his young, grateful, <i>adventurous<\/i> fellow traveler -\n\n     FADE TO BLACK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   <\/pre>\n<\/body>\n\n<\/html>\n","id":583,"split":"train"}
