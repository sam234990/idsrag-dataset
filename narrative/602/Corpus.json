{"ori_id":"8e7d209dd54a50345632ec639627a23be362a95c","title":"Single White Female","context":"Single White Female\n Allison \"Allie\" Jones (Bridget Fonda) is a software designer in New York City, engaged to Sam Rawson (Steven Weber). In the middle of the night, Sam's ex-wife calls, and it is revealed that he slept with her recently. A hurt and angry Allie throws Sam out, breaking off their engagement, and is comforted by neighbor Graham Knox (Peter Friedman), an aspiring actor. The next morning she attends a business lunch with Mitchell Myerson (Stephen Tobolowsky), a fashion house owner who is looking to buy Allie's revolutionary new program. He manipulates her into significantly reducing the cost, on the basis that his recommendations within the industry will be her future business. As he is her first and only client, she accepts.\nAllie advertises for a new roommate to share her apartment in the Ansonia. She eventually settles on Hedra Carlson (Jennifer Jason Leigh), whom she nicknames \"Hedy\", and they become friends. Hedy tells of how she was supposed to be a twin but her twin was stillborn, leaving her with a constant feeling of loneliness. After a few weeks, however, Hedy becomes overly protective of Allie by erasing Sam's voice-mail asking Allie for a reconciliation. Later she buys a puppy that she names Buddy to bond with Allie. Hedy soon becomes jealous and upset when Sam is able to win Allie back.\nAllie and Sam seek a new apartment for themselves. On their way back to Allie and Hedy's apartment, Allie is horrified to see that Buddy has fallen to his death from the balcony. Angry and upset, she accuses Hedy of leaving the window open resulting in the puppy's death. However that night while comforting a distraught Hedy, Sam tells her that \"if anyone's to blame, it's my fault.\"\nMyerson attempts to rape Allie on completion of their deal, insinuating that if she does not submit to him, he will warn off future clients and not pay her. She fights back and escapes.\nTo help Allie feel better, Hedy takes her to the salon for a haircut. When Allie is done, Hedy appears on the stairs dressed exactly like her including her haircut, which unnerves Allie. Later that night, Allie follows Hedy to an underground nightclub and witnesses Hedy passing herself off as Allie. Later while Hedy is taking a shower, Allie finds a shoebox containing letters addressed to Ellen Besch (Hedy's real name) as well as Sam's letter and a newspaper clipping on the accidental drowning of Hedy's twin sister when she was nine.\nThat night while Allie tells Graham the truth about Hedy, they are unaware that Hedy is listening back in their apartment. When Allie leaves, Hedy goes up to the apartment and attacks Graham.\nWhen Sam returns the following night, Hedy again impersonates Allie and performs oral sex on him. After the act, Hedy begs Sam to leave Allie alone, but Sam refuses and insists on telling Allie the truth. Furious, Hedy kills him, gouging his eye with her stiletto heel.\nThe next day Hedy tells Allie she is about to leave. Later Allie sees a news report on Sam's death, realizes what has happened and tries to leave. Hedy takes Allie hostage at gunpoint. She states that everyone will assume Allie killed Sam since both Hedy and Allie resemble each other. In order to \"protect\" Allie, Hedy convinces her that they must run away. When Hedy leaves, Allie attempts to send a distress message, but Hedy catches her and angrily confronts her.\nMyerson in the meantime notices his files being erased and rushes off to find Allie. He finds her tied up on the floor, but is attacked and killed by Hedy. Hedy attempts to persuade Allie to commit suicide, but Allie instead smashes the water glass in Hedy's face. The women struggle for the gun which Hedy points at Allie as she tries to run, begging Allie not to leave her. Allie coldly tells her, \"I'm not like your sister, Hedy. Not anymore. I'm like you now.\" Graham regains consciousness and tries to assist Allie but the enraged Hedy refuses to give up. Allie drags Hedy off her friend, flees and is shot in the shoulder by Hedy.\nA chase ensues from Graham's apartment to the elevator where Hedy chokes Allie unconscious and drags her towards the furnace. When Hedy finds Allie missing, she grabs a hook from a closet and screams for Allie to come out. Lured into thinking Allie is hiding in another closet, Hedy lashes out at a mirror inside. She is then stabbed in the back by Allie and they struggle briefly before Allie strikes one last blow. She then watches in horror and sadness as Hedy dies.\nIn an epilogue, Allie narrates that she has finally moved on. She forgives Hedy for killing Sam, and keeps trying to forgive herself for Hedy. She states that Hedy's survivor's guilt was her downfall. Allie states that she knows what happens to those people. The final shot is a photo of her and Hedy's faces superimposed as one.\n<html>\n<head><title>Single White Female Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Single White Female script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Single White Female script, Single White Female movie script, Single White Female film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

Before entering the living room, she takes a blue bag in the\nkitchen (maybe something to eat) and drops it on a table. But,\nbeing a bit nervous, she actually drops the bag on a small bowl\ncontaining various objects, and the bowl falls on the floor and\nbreaks into pieces.\n\n<b>       HEDRA\n<\/b>       Allie ?\n\nHedra looks at the fallen bowl and bends down to pick up the\ndebris.\n\n<b>       HEDRA\n<\/b>       God...\n\nThe bowl has fallen near the air vent. It is exactly the same as\nthe one which, earlier in the film, had enabled Graham to hear Sam\nand Allison's conversation.\n\nHedra kneels down to gather the pieces of the broken bowl. We hear\na faint voice. Hedra raises her head, trying to find out where\nthis faint voice comes from.\n\nFirst, we don't understand the words the faint voice is saying,\nthen it becomes clearer. It's Allison's voice speaking to Graham\nin his apartment.\n\n       ALLISON (voice over from the air vent)\n       It's like looking at myself. And she lies. I found a\n       shoebox in her room.\n\nHedra understands that the voice is coming from the air vent, and\nshe moves closer to it.\n\n       ALLISON (voice over from the air vent)\n       Nothing she told me is true. The twin that she said died at\n       birth. It was in an accident when she was nine.\n\nHedra moves a brass knob on the air vent, to open it wider and to\nhave a better understanding of the words.\n\n<b>GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT\n<\/b>\nGraham and Allison are sitting on a couch.

She is crying.\n\n<b>       HEDRA\n<\/b>       I'm scared ! Where are you ?\nThe rat has reached Allison's hiding place. She pushes it down\nfrom the pipe where it was standing.\n\nThe rat falls on Hedra's shoulder. She screams.\n\nAllison hides back into the ventilation metal box not to be seen\nby Hedra.\n\nHedra throws the rat on the floor.\n\nThe rat runs away.\n\nHedra looks up at the place where the rat fell from.\n\nClose up at Allison's hiding place. The metal box seems empty.\n\n       HEDRA (voice over)\n       Allie...\n\n<b>ALLISON'S BUILDING - INCINERATOR ROOM - INTERIOR DAY\n<\/b>\nHedra comes back into the incinerator room. Just above the open\ndoor of the incinerator, there is a big ventilation metal box,\nsimilar to the one Allison is hiding in.\n\nHedra bangs the box with her hook. She must think that Allison is\ncrawling inside the ventilation system.\n\n<b>ALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY\n<\/b>\nAllison is peeking from behind a corner of the corridor.\n\nReverse angle shot showing what Allison sees. We - and she - see\nthe incinerator room with Hedra banging her hook on the\nventilation system.\n\n<b>ALLISON'S BUILDING - INCINERATOR ROOM - INTERIOR DAY\n<\/b>Hedra is walking backward, away from the incinerator. She hears a\nstrange noise and turns around.\n\n<b>ALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY\n<\/b>\nWe see the open door of a cage slightly moving with a squeaking\nnoise.\n\nHedra walks toward the cage.\n\n<b>       HEDRA\n<\/b>       Why are you hiding from me ?\n\nClose up on a big wooden closet with two doors. A piece of green\nfabric is sticking out between the two closed doors.\n\nHedra bangs her hook on the closet.\n\n<b>       HEDRA\n<\/b>       You think I can't find you ? Huh ? Your goddam shirt is\n       sticking out of it.\nShe opens the door, sees herself in a mirror at the back of the\ncloset, and thinking it's Allison, bangs her hook on the mirror\nand breaks it.\n\nHedra backs up one step from the closet. And suddenly, Allison,\nwho was hiding in the pipework on the ceiling, falls down upside\ndown, hanging from her legs hooked in the pipework. She stabs\nHedra in the back with the elevator screwdriver. Hedra screams,\nand tries to take the screwdriver off her back.\n\nAllison drops on the floor. Hedra tries to hit her with the hook,\nbut Allison grabs her arm.\n\nWith her other free hand, Allison pulls the screwdriver out of\nHedra's back, then immediately sticks it again in another place on\nHedra's back.\n\n<b>       HEDRA\n<\/b>       Allie...\n\nHedra slowly falls on the floor, where she remains motionless.\n\nAllison looks down at her, trying to catch her breath back.\n\nShe kneels down to close Hedra's eyelids.\n\n<b>BLACK SCREEN\n<\/b>\n       ALLISON (voice over)\n       I cried the whole week of Sam's funeral.\n\n<b>ALLISON'S NEW APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY\n<\/b>\nThis is Allison's new place. Actually it is the apartment Allison\nvisited with Sam, just before the puppy's death.\n\nSome furniture from the old apartment, and a lot of unopened boxes\non the floor. It looks like if Allison just moved in.\n\nVery large windows overlooking New-York. Allison is standing near\none of the windows, with her back toward us.\n\n\n       ALLISON (voice over)\n       Graham says that won't bring him back. He says I have to\n       start letting go. He's right.\n\nClose up on Hedra's collection of photographs, lying near the\nshoebox where she used to stock them. In the forefront, the black\nand white picture of Hedra and her twin sister holding a dog\nbetween them.\n\n       ALLISON (voice over)\n       Hedy's parents said that for years they'd tried to explain\n       her that her sister's death wasn't her fault.\n\nWe see Allison's hands taking the pictures one by one.\n\n       ALLISON (voice over)\n          But she never forgave herself for surviving.\n\nThe last picture she takes is the black and white picture of the\ntwins with the dog. She puts all the pictures back in the shoebox,\nwith the twins and dog picture on the top.\n\n          ALLISON (voice over)\n          So every day, I try to forgive Hedy for Sam.\n\nAllison puts the lid back on the shoebox.\n\n          ALLISON (voice over)\n          Then I try to do what she couldn't... Forgive myself.\n\nThe camera moves slowly away from the shoebox to a last photograph\nhidden underneath some wrapping plastic material.\n\n          ALLISON (voice over)\n          I know what can happen to someone who doesn't.\n\nClose up on the picture. It looks like the picture of the face of\none woman. But actually, the picture is a mixture of two pictures.\nThe left half-side of the picture shows Allison's face, when the\nright half-side shows Hedra's face.\n\n<b>CREDITS\n<\/b>\nThe credit are rolling up on the picture of Hedra \/ Allison for\nabout 25 seconds, then fade-out to black screen, where the end of\nthe credits are rolling up.\n<\/pre><br>\n<table width=\"85%\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\">\n  <tr> \n\t<td align=center><img src=\"\/posters\/Single-White-Female.jpg\" border=0>\n\t<td><h1>Single White Female<\/h1><br><br>\n\t    <b>Writers<\/b> : &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/writer.php?w=Don Roos\" title=\"Scripts by Don Roos\">Don Roos<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/writer.php?w=John Lutz\" title=\"Scripts by John Lutz\">John Lutz<\/a><br>\n    \t<b>Genres<\/b> : &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/genre\/Drama\" title=\"Drama Scripts\">Drama<\/a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/genre\/Thriller\" title=\"Thriller Scripts\">Thriller<\/a><br><br><br>\n\t\t\n\t\t<a href=\"\/Movie Scripts\/Single White Female Script.html#comments\" title=\"Single White Female comments\">User Comments<\/a>\n\t<\/td>\n<\/table>\n<br><br>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database\"><img src=\"\/images\/lilbutton.gif\" style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"  alt=\"Internet Movie Script Database\" border=1><br>\nBack to IMSDb<\/a>\n<\/div><br>\n<br><br>\n  <\/tr>\n<\/table>\n<br><br>\n<\/table>\n\n<table width=\"99%\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"body\">\n  <tr> \n  <td background=\"\/images\/reel.gif\" height=\"13\" colspan=\"2\">\n<\/table>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n <a href=\"https:\/\/www.imsdb.com\" title=\"Internet Movie Script Database (IMSDb)\">Index<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/submit\" title=\"Submit scripts\">Submit<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/links\" title=\"Other sites\">Links<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/link to us\" title=\"Link to IMSDb\">Link to us<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/feeds\" title=\"IMSDb RSS Feeds\">RSS Feeds<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/disclaimer\">Disclaimer<\/a> \n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n <a href=\"\/privacy\">Privacy policy<\/a> \n<\/div>\n\n<br \/>\n\n<\/body>\n<\/html>","id":602,"split":"train"}
