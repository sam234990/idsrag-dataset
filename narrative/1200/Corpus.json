He shows, for example, that in large industrial cities such as Manchester and Liverpool, mortality from disease (such as smallpox, measles, scarlet fever and whooping cough) was four times that in the surrounding countryside, and mortality from convulsions was ten times as high. The overall death-rate in Manchester and Liverpool was significantly higher than the national average (1 in 32.72, 1 in 31.90 and even 1 in 29.90, compared with 1 in 45 or 46). An interesting example shows the increase in the overall death-rates in the industrial town of Carlisle where before the introduction of mills (1779\u00e2\u0080\u009387), 4,408 out of 10,000 children died before reaching the age of five, and after their introduction the figure rose to 4,738. Before the introduction of mills, 1,006 out of 10,000 adults died before reaching 39 years old, and after their introduction the death rate rose to 1,261 out of 10,000.\nEngels' interpretation proved to be extremely influential with British historians of the Industrial Revolution. He focused on both the workers' wages and their living conditions. He argued that the industrial workers had lower incomes than their pre-industrial peers and they lived in more unhealthy and unpleasant environments. This proved to be a very wide-ranging critique of industrialisation and one that was echoed by many of the Marxist historians who studied the industrial revolution in the 20th century.\nOriginally addressed to a German audience, the book is considered by many to be a classic account of the universal condition of the industrial working class during its time. The eldest son of a successful German textile industrialist, Engels became involved in radical journalism in his youth. Sent to England, what he saw there made him even more radical. About this time he formed his lifelong intellectual partnership with Karl Marx.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Condition of the Working-Class in England\nin 1844, by Frederick Engels, Translated by Florence Kelley Wischnewetzky\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

The author, at that time, was young, twenty-\nfour years of age, and his production bears the stamp of his youth with\nits good and its faulty features, of neither of which he feels ashamed.\nIt was translated into English, in 1885, by an American lady, Mrs. F.\nKelley Wischnewetzky, and published in the following year in New York.\nThe American edition being as good as exhausted, and having never been\nextensively circulated on this side of the Atlantic, the present English\ncopyright edition is brought out with the full consent of all parties\ninterested.\n\nFor the American edition, a new Preface and an Appendix were written in\nEnglish by the author.  The first had little to do with the book itself;\nit discussed the American Working-Class Movement of the day, and is,\ntherefore, here omitted as irrelevant, the second--the original\npreface--is largely made use of in the present introductory remarks.\n\nThe state of things described in this book belongs to-day, in many\nrespects, to the past, as far as England is concerned.  Though not\nexpressly stated in our recognised treatises, it is still a law of modern\nPolitical Economy that the larger the scale on which Capitalistic\nProduction is carried on, the less can it support the petty devices of\nswindling and pilfering which characterise its early stages.  The\npettifogging business tricks of the Polish Jew, the representative in\nEurope of commerce in its lowest stage, those tricks that serve him so\nwell in his own country, and are generally practised there, he finds to\nbe out of date and out of place when he comes to Hamburg or Berlin; and,\nagain, the commission agent, who hails from Berlin or Hamburg, Jew or\nChristian, after frequenting the Manchester Exchange for a few months,\nfinds out that, in order to buy cotton yarn or cloth cheap, he, too, had\nbetter drop those slightly more refined but still miserable wiles and\nsubterfuges which are considered the acme of cleverness in his native\ncountry.  The fact is, those tricks do not pay any longer in a large\nmarket, where time is money, and where a certain standard of commercial\nmorality is unavoidably developed, purely as a means of saving time and\ntrouble.  And it is the same with the relation between the manufacturer\nand his \"hands.\"\n\nThe revival of trade, after the crisis of 1847, was the dawn of a new\nindustrial epoch.  The repeal of the Corn Laws and the financial reforms\nsubsequent thereon gave to English industry and commerce all the elbow-\nroom they had asked for.  The discovery of the Californian and Australian\ngold-fields followed in rapid succession.  The Colonial markets developed\nat an increasing rate their capacity for absorbing English manufactured\ngoods.  In India millions of hand-weavers were finally crushed out by the\nLancashire power-loom.  China was more and more being opened up.  Above\nall, the United States--then, commercially speaking, a mere colonial\nmarket, but by far the biggest of them all--underwent an economic\ndevelopment astounding even for that rapidly progressive country.  And,\nfinally, the new means of communication introduced at the close of the\npreceding period--railways and ocean steamers--were now worked out on an\ninternational scale; they realised actually, what had hitherto existed\nonly potentially, a world-market.  This world-market, at first, was\ncomposed of a number of chiefly or entirely agricultural countries\ngrouped around one manufacturing centre--England--which consumed the\ngreater part of their surplus raw produce, and supplied them in return\nwith the greater part of their requirements in manufactured articles.  No\nwonder England's industrial progress was colossal and unparalleled, and\nsuch that the status of 1844 now appears to us as comparatively primitive\nand insignificant.  And in proportion as this increase took place, in the\nsame proportion did manufacturing industry become apparently moralised.\nThe competition of manufacturer against manufacturer by means of petty\nthefts upon the workpeople did no longer pay.  Trade had outgrown such\nlow means of making money; they were not worth while practising for the\nmanufacturing millionaire, and served merely to keep alive the\ncompetition of smaller traders, thankful to pick up a penny wherever they\ncould.  Thus the truck system was suppressed, the Ten Hours' Bill was\nenacted, and a number of other secondary reforms introduced--much against\nthe spirit of Free Trade and unbridled competition, but quite as much in\nfavour of the giant-capitalist in his competition with his less favoured\nbrother.  Moreover, the larger the concern, and with it the number of\nhands, the greater the loss and inconvenience caused by every conflict\nbetween master and men; and thus a new spirit came over the masters,\nespecially the large ones, which taught them to avoid unnecessary\nsquabbles, to acquiesce in the existence and power of Trades' Unions, and\nfinally even to discover in strikes--at opportune times--a powerful means\nto serve their own ends.  The largest manufacturers, formerly the leaders\nof the war against the working-class, were now the foremost to preach\npeace and harmony.  And for a very good reason.  The fact is, that all\nthese concessions to justice and philanthropy were nothing else but means\nto accelerate the concentration of capital in the hands of the few, for\nwhom the niggardly extra extortions of former years had lost all\nimportance and had become actual nuisances; and to crush all the quicker\nand all the safer their smaller competitors, who could not make both ends\nmeet without such perquisites.  Thus the development of production on the\nbasis of the capitalistic system has of itself sufficed--at least in the\nleading industries, for in the more unimportant branches this is far from\nbeing the case--to do away with all those minor grievances which\naggravated the workman's fate during its earlier stages.  And thus it\nrenders more and more evident the great central fact, that the cause of\nthe miserable condition of the working-class is to be sought, not in\nthese minor grievances, but _in the Capitalistic System itself_.  The\nwage-worker sells to the capitalist his labour-force for a certain daily\nsum.  After a few hours' work he has reproduced the value of that sum;\nbut the substance of his contract is, that he has to work another series\nof hours to complete his working-day; and the value he produces during\nthese additional hours of surplus labour is surplus value, which cost the\ncapitalist nothing, but yet goes into his pocket.  That is the basis of\nthe system which tends more and more to split up civilised society into a\nfew Rothschilds and Vanderbilts, the owners of all the means of\nproduction and subsistence, on the one hand, and an immense number of\nwage-workers, the owners of nothing but their labour-force, on the other.\nAnd that this result is caused, not by this or that secondary grievance,\nbut by the system itself--this fact has been brought out in bold relief\nby the development of Capitalism in England since 1847.\n\nAgain, the repeated visitations of cholera, typhus, smallpox, and other\nepidemics have shown the British bourgeois the urgent necessity of\nsanitation in his towns and cities, if he wishes to save himself and\nfamily from falling victims to such diseases.  Accordingly, the most\ncrying abuses described in this book have either disappeared or have been\nmade less conspicuous.  Drainage has been introduced or improved, wide\navenues have been opened out athwart many of the worst \"slums\" I had to\ndescribe.  \"Little Ireland\" has disappeared, and the \"Seven Dials\" are\nnext on the list for sweeping away.  But what of that?  Whole districts\nwhich in 1844 I could describe as almost idyllic, have now, with the\ngrowth of the towns, fallen into the same state of dilapidation,\ndiscomfort, and misery.  Only the pigs and the heaps of refuse are no\nlonger tolerated.  The bourgeoisie have made further progress in the art\nof hiding the distress of the working-class.  But that, in regard to\ntheir dwellings, no substantial improvement has taken place, is amply\nproved by the Report of the Royal Commission \"on the Housing of the\nPoor,\" 1885.  And this is the case, too, in other respects.  Police\nregulations have been plentiful as blackberries; but they can only hedge\nin the distress of the workers, they cannot remove it.\n\nBut while England has thus outgrown the juvenile state of capitalist\nexploitation described by me, other countries have only just attained it.\nFrance, Germany, and especially America, are the formidable competitors\nwho, at this moment--as foreseen by me in 1844--are more and more\nbreaking up England's industrial monopoly.  Their manufactures are young\nas compared with those of England, but increasing at a far more rapid\nrate than the latter; and, curious enough, they have at this moment\narrived at about the same phase of development as English manufacture in\n1844.  With regard to America, the parallel is indeed most striking.\nTrue, the external surroundings in which the working-class is placed in\nAmerica are very different, but the same economical laws are at work, and\nthe results, if not identical in every respect, must still be of the same\norder.  Hence we find in America the same struggles for a shorter working-\nday, for a legal limitation of the working-time, especially of women and\nchildren in factories; we find the truck-system in full blossom, and the\ncottage-system, in rural districts, made use of by the \"bosses\" as a\nmeans of domination over the workers.  When I received, in 1886, the\nAmerican papers with accounts of the great strike of 12,000 Pennsylvanian\ncoal-miners in the Connellsville district, I seemed but to read my own\ndescription of the North of England colliers' strike of 1844.  The same\ncheating of the workpeople by false measure; the same truck-system; the\nsame attempt to break the miners' resistance by the capitalists' last,\nbut crushing, resource,--the eviction of the men out of their dwellings,\nthe cottages owned by the companies.\n\nI have not attempted, in this translation, to bring the book up to date,\nor to point out in detail all the changes that have taken place since\n1844.  And for two reasons: Firstly, to do this properly, the size of the\nbook must be about doubled; and, secondly, the first volume of \"Das\nKapital,\" by Karl Marx, an English translation of which is before the\npublic, contains a very ample description of the state of the British\nworking-class, as it was about 1865, that is to say, at the time when\nBritish industrial prosperity reached its culminating point.  I should,\nthen, have been obliged again to go over the ground already covered by\nMarx's celebrated work.\n\nIt will be hardly necessary to point out that the general theoretical\nstandpoint of this book--philosophical, economical, political--does not\nexactly coincide with my standpoint of to-day.  Modern international\nSocialism, since fully developed as a science, chiefly and almost\nexclusively through the efforts of Marx, did not as yet exist in 1844.  My\nbook represents one of the phases of its embryonic development; and as\nthe human embryo, in its early stages, still reproduces the gill-arches\nof our fish-ancestors, so this book exhibits everywhere the traces of the\ndescent of modern Socialism from one of its ancestors,--German\nphilosophy.  Thus great stress is laid on the dictum that Communism is\nnot a mere party doctrine of the working-class, but a theory compassing\nthe emancipation of society at large, including the capitalist class,\nfrom its present narrow conditions.  This is true enough in the abstract,\nbut absolutely useless, and sometimes worse, in practice.  So long as the\nwealthy classes not only do not feel the want of any emancipation, but\nstrenuously oppose the self-emancipation of the working-class, so long\nthe social revolution will have to be prepared and fought out by the\nworking-class alone.  The French bourgeois of 1789, too, declared the\nemancipation of the bourgeoisie to be the emancipation of the whole human\nrace; but the nobility and clergy would not see it; the\nproposition--though for the time being, with respect to feudalism, an\nabstract historical truth--soon became a mere sentimentalism, and\ndisappeared from view altogether in the fire of the revolutionary\nstruggle.  And to-day, the very people who, from the \"impartiality\" of\ntheir superior standpoint, preach to the workers a Socialism soaring high\nabove their class interests and class struggles, and tending to reconcile\nin a higher humanity the interests of both the contending classes--these\npeople are either neophytes, who have still to learn a great deal, or\nthey are the worst enemies of the workers,--wolves in sheeps' clothing.\n\nThe recurring period of the great industrial crisis is stated in the text\nas five years.  This was the period apparently indicated by the course of\nevents from 1825 to 1842.  But the industrial history from 1842 to 1868\nhas shown that the real period is one of ten years; that the intermediate\nrevulsions were secondary, and tended more and more to disappear.  Since\n1868 the state of things has changed again, of which more anon.\n\nI have taken care not to strike out of the text the many prophecies,\namongst others that of an imminent social revolution in England, which my\nyouthful ardour induced me to venture upon.  The wonder is, not that a\ngood many of them proved wrong, but that so many of them have proved\nright, and that the critical state of English trade, to be brought on by\nContinental and especially American competition, which I then\nforesaw--though in too short a period--has now actually come to pass.  In\nthis respect I can, and am bound to, bring the book up to date, by\nplacing here an article which I published in the _London Commonweal_ of\nMarch 1, 1885, under the heading: \"England in 1845 and in 1885.\"  It\ngives at the same time a short outline of the history of the English\nworking-class during these forty years, and is as follows:\n\n   \"Forty years ago England stood face to face with a crisis, solvable to\n   all appearances by force only.  The immense and rapid development of\n   manufactures had outstripped the extension of foreign markets and the\n   increase of demand.  Every ten years the march of industry was\n   violently interrupted by a general commercial crash, followed, after a\n   long period of chronic depression, by a few short years of prosperity,\n   and always ending in feverish over-production and consequent renewed\n   collapse.  The capitalist class clamoured for Free Trade in corn, and\n   threatened to enforce it by sending the starving population of the\n   towns back to the country districts whence they came, to invade them,\n   as John Bright said, not as paupers begging for bread, but as an army\n   quartered upon the enemy.  The working masses of the towns demanded\n   their share of political power--the People's Charter; they were\n   supported by the majority of the small trading class, and the only\n   difference between the two was whether the Charter should be carried\n   by physical or by moral force.  Then came the commercial crash of 1847\n   and the Irish famine, and with both the prospect of revolution\n\n   \"The French Revolution of 1848 saved the English middle-class.  The\n   Socialistic pronunciamentos of the victorious French workmen\n   frightened the small middle-class of England and disorganised the\n   narrower, but more matter-of-fact movement of the English\n   working-class.  At the very moment when Chartism was bound to assert\n   itself in its full strength, it collapsed internally, before even it\n   collapsed externally on the 10th of April, 1848.  The action of the\n   working-class was thrust into the background.  The capitalist class\n   triumphed along the whole line.\n\n   \"The Reform Bill of 1831 had been the victory of the whole capitalist\n   class over the landed aristocracy.  The repeal of the Corn Laws was\n   the victory of the manufacturing capitalist not only over the landed\n   aristocracy, but over those sections of capitalists, too, whose\n   interests were more or less bound up with the landed\n   interest,--bankers, stock-jobbers, fund-holders, etc.  Free Trade\n   meant the re-adjustment of the whole home and foreign, commercial and\n   financial policy of England in accordance with the interests of the\n   manufacturing capitalists--the class which now represented the nation.\n   And they set about this task with a will.  Every obstacle to\n   industrial production was mercilessly removed.  The tariff and the\n   whole system of taxation were revolutionised.  Everything was made\n   subordinate to one end, but that end of the utmost importance to the\n   manufacturing capitalist: the cheapening of all raw produce, and\n   especially of the means of living of the working-class; the reduction\n   of the cost of raw material, and the keeping down--if not as yet the\n   _bringing down_--of wages.  England was to become the 'workshop of the\n   world;' all other countries were to become for England what Ireland\n   already was,--markets for her manufactured goods, supplying her in\n   return with raw materials and food.  England the great manufacturing\n   centre of an agricultural world, with an ever-increasing number of\n   corn and cotton-growing Irelands revolving around her, the industrial\n   sun.  What a glorious prospect!\n\n   \"The manufacturing capitalists set about the realisation of this their\n   great object with that strong common sense and that contempt for\n   traditional principles which has ever distinguished them from their\n   more narrow-minded compeers on the Continent.  Chartism was dying out.\n   The revival of commercial prosperity, natural after the revulsion of\n   1847 had spent itself, was put down altogether to the credit of Free\n   Trade.  Both these circumstances had turned the English working-class,\n   politically, into the tail of the 'great Liberal party,' the party led\n   by the manufacturers.  This advantage, once gained, had to be\n   perpetuated.  And the manufacturing capitalists, from the Chartist\n   opposition, not to Free Trade, but to the transformation of Free Trade\n   into the one vital national question, had learnt, and were learning\n   more and more, that the middle-class can never obtain full social and\n   political power over the nation except by the help of the\n   working-class.  Thus a gradual change came over the relations between\n   both classes.  The Factory Acts, once the bugbear of all\n   manufacturers, were not only willingly submitted to, but their\n   expansion into acts regulating almost all trades, was tolerated.\n   Trades' Unions, hitherto considered inventions of the devil himself,\n   were now petted and patronised as perfectly legitimate institutions,\n   and as useful means of spreading sound economical doctrines amongst\n   the workers.  Even strikes, than which nothing had been more nefarious\n   up to 1848, were now gradually found out to be occasionally very\n   useful, especially when provoked by the masters themselves, at their\n   own time.  Of the legal enactments, placing the workman at a lower\n   level or at a disadvantage with regard to the master, at least the\n   most revolting were repealed.  And, practically, that horrid 'People's\n   Charter' actually became the political programme of the very\n   manufacturers who had opposed it to the last.  'The Abolition of the\n   Property Qualification' and 'Vote by Ballot' are now the law of the\n   land.  The Reform Acts of 1867 and 1884 make a near approach to\n   'universal suffrage,' at least such as it now exists in Germany; the\n   Redistribution Bill now before Parliament creates 'equal electoral\n   districts'--on the whole not more unequal than those of Germany;\n   'payment of members,' and shorter, if not actually 'annual\n   Parliaments,' are visibly looming in the distance--and yet there are\n   people who say that Chartism is dead.\n\n   \"The Revolution of 1848, not less than many of its predecessors, has\n   had strange bedfellows and successors.  The very people who put it\n   down have become, as Karl Marx used to say, its testamentary\n   executors.  Louis Napoleon had to create an independent and united\n   Italy, Bismarck had to revolutionise Germany and to restore Hungarian\n   independence, and the English manufacturers had to enact the People's\n   Charter.\n\n   \"For England, the effects of this domination of the manufacturing\n   capitalists were at first startling.  Trade revived and extended to a\n   degree unheard of even in this cradle of modern industry; the previous\n   astounding creations of steam and machinery dwindled into nothing\n   compared with the immense mass of productions of the twenty years from\n   1850 to 1870, with the overwhelming figures of exports and imports, of\n   wealth accumulated in the hands of capitalists and of human working\n   power concentrated in the large towns.  The progress was indeed\n   interrupted, as before, by a crisis every ten years, in 1857 as well\n   as in 1866; but these revulsions were now considered as natural,\n   inevitable events, which must be fatalistically submitted to, and\n   which always set themselves right in the end.\n\n   \"And the condition of the working-class during this period?  There was\n   temporary improvement even for the great mass.  But this improvement\n   always was reduced to the old level by the influx of the great body of\n   the unemployed reserve, by the constant superseding of bands by new\n   machinery, by the immigration of the agricultural population, now,\n   too, more and more superseded by machines.\n\n   \"A permanent improvement can be recognised for two 'protected'\n   sections only of the working-class.  Firstly, the factory hands.  The\n   fixing by Act of Parliament of their working-day within relatively\n   rational limits has restored their physical constitution and endowed\n   them with a moral superiority, enhanced by their local concentration.\n   They are undoubtedly better off than before 1848.  The best proof is\n   that, out of ten strikes they make, nine are provoked by the\n   manufacturers in their own interests, as the only means of securing a\n   reduced production.  You can never get the masters to agree to work\n   'short time,' let manufactured goods be ever so unsaleable; but get\n   the workpeople to strike, and the masters shut their factories to a\n   man.\n\n   \"Secondly, the great Trades' Unions.  They are the organisations of\n   those trades in which the labour of _grown-up men_ predominates, or is\n   alone applicable.  Here the competition neither of women and children\n   nor of machinery has so far weakened their organised strength.  The\n   engineers, the carpenters, and joiners, the bricklayers, are each of\n   them a power, to that extent that, as in the case of the bricklayers\n   and bricklayers' labourers, they can even successfully resist the\n   introduction of machinery.  That their condition has remarkably\n   improved since 1848 there can be no doubt, and the best proof of this\n   is in the fact, that for more than fifteen years not only have their\n   employers been with them, but they with their employers, upon\n   exceedingly good terms.  They form an aristocracy among the working-\n   class; they have succeeded in enforcing for themselves a relatively\n   comfortable position, and they accept it as final.  They are the model\n   working-men of Messrs. Leone Levi & Giffen, and they are very nice\n   people indeed nowadays to deal with, for any sensible capitalist in\n   particular and for the whole capitalist class in general.\n\n   \"But as to the great mass of working-people, the state of misery and\n   insecurity in which they live now is as low as ever, if not lower.  The\n   East End of London is an everspreading pool of stagnant misery and\n   desolation, of starvation when out of work, and degradation, physical\n   and moral, when in work.  And so in all other large towns--abstraction\n   made of the privileged minority of the workers; and so in the smaller\n   towns and in the agricultural districts.  The law which reduces the\n   _value_ of labour-power to the value of the necessary means of\n   subsistence, and the other law which reduces its _average price_, as a\n   rule, to the minimum of those means of subsistence, these laws act\n   upon them with the irresistible force of an automatic engine, which\n   crushes them between its wheels.\n\n   \"This, then, was the position created by the Free Trade policy of\n   1847, and by twenty years of the rule of the manufacturing\n   capitalists.  But, then, a change came.  The crash of 1866 was,\n   indeed, followed by a slight and short revival about 1873; but that\n   did not last.  We did not, indeed, pass through the full crisis at the\n   time it was due, in 1877 or 1878; but we have had, ever since 1876, a\n   chronic state of stagnation in all dominant branches of industry.\n   Neither will the full crash come; nor will the period of longed-for\n   prosperity to which we used to be entitled before and after it.  A\n   dull depression, a chronic glut of all markets for all trades, that is\n   what we have been living in for nearly ten years.  How is this?\n\n   \"The Free Trade theory was based upon one assumption: that England was\n   to be the one great manufacturing centre of an agricultural world.  And\n   the actual fact is that this assumption has turned out to be a pure\n   delusion.  The conditions of modern industry, steam-power and\n   machinery, can be established wherever there is fuel, especially\n   coals.  And other countries beside England,--France, Belgium, Germany,\n   America, even Russia,--have coals.  And the people over there did not\n   see the advantage of being turned into Irish pauper farmers merely for\n   the greater wealth and glory of English capitalists.  They set\n   resolutely about manufacturing, not only for themselves, but for the\n   rest of the world; and the consequence is, that the manufacturing\n   monopoly enjoyed by England for nearly a century is irretrievably\n   broken up.\n\n   \"But the manufacturing monopoly of England is the pivot of the present\n   social system of England.  Even while that monopoly lasted, the\n   markets could not keep pace with the increasing productivity of\n   English manufacturers; the decennial crises were the consequence.  And\n   new markets are getting scarcer every day, so much so that even the\n   negroes of the Congo are now to be forced into the civilisation\n   attendant upon Manchester calicos, Staffordshire pottery, and\n   Birmingham hardware.  How will it be when Continental, and especially\n   American, goods flow in in ever-increasing quantities--when the\n   predominating share, still held by British manufacturers, will become\n   reduced from year to year?  Answer, Free Trade, thou universal\n   panacea.\n\n   \"I am not the first to point this out.  Already, in 1883, at the\n   Southport meeting of the British Association, Mr. Inglis Palgrave, the\n   President of the Economic section, stated plainly that 'the days of\n   great trade profits in England were over, and there was a pause in the\n   progress of several great branches of industrial labour.  _The country\n   might almost be said to be entering the non-progressive state_.'\n\n   \"But what is to be the consequence?  Capitalist production _cannot_\n   stop.  It must go on increasing and expanding, or it must die.  Even\n   now, the mere reduction of England's lion's share in the supply of the\n   world's markets means stagnation, distress, excess of capital here,\n   excess of unemployed workpeople there.  What will it be when the\n   increase of yearly production is brought to a complete stop?\n\n   \"Here is the vulnerable place, the heel of Achilles, for capitalistic\n   production.  Its very basis is the necessity of constant expansion,\n   and this constant expansion now becomes impossible.  It ends in a\n   deadlock.  Every year England is brought nearer face to face with the\n   question: either the country must go to pieces, or capitalist\n   production must.  Which is it to be?\n\n   \"And the working-class?  If even under the unparalleled commercial and\n   industrial expansion, from 1848 to 1866, they have had to undergo such\n   misery; if even then the great bulk of them experienced at best but a\n   temporary improvement of their condition, while only a small,\n   privileged, 'protected' minority was permanently benefited, what will\n   it be when this dazzling period is brought finally to a close; when\n   the present dreary stagnation shall not only become intensified, but\n   this, its intensified condition, shall become the permanent and normal\n   state of English trade?\n\n   \"The truth is this: during the period of England's industrial monopoly\n   the English working-class have, to a certain extent, shared in the\n   benefits of the monopoly.  These benefits were very unequally\n   parcelled out amongst them; the privileged minority pocketed most, but\n   even the great mass had, at least, a temporary share now and then.  And\n   that is the reason why, since the dying-out of Owenism, there has been\n   no Socialism in England.  With the breakdown of that monopoly, the\n   English working-class will lose that privileged position; it will find\n   itself generally--the privileged and leading minority not excepted--on\n   a level with its fellow-workers abroad.  And that is the reason why\n   there will be Socialism again in England.\"\n\nTo this statement of the case, as that case appeared to me in 1885, I\nhave but little to add.  Needless to say that to-day there is indeed\n\"Socialism again in England,\" and plenty of it--Socialism of all shades:\nSocialism conscious and unconscious, Socialism prosaic and poetic,\nSocialism of the working-class and of the middle-class, for, verily, that\nabomination of abominations, Socialism, has not only become respectable,\nbut has actually donned evening dress and lounges lazily on drawing-room\n_causeuses_.  That shows the incurable fickleness of that terrible despot\nof \"society,\" middle-class public opinion, and once more justifies the\ncontempt in which we Socialists of a past generation always held that\npublic opinion.  At the same time, we have no reason to grumble at the\nsymptom itself.\n\nWhat I consider far more important than this momentary fashion among\nbourgeois circles of affecting a mild dilution of Socialism, and even\nmore than the actual progress Socialism has made in England generally,\nthat is the revival of the East End of London.  That immense haunt of\nmisery is no longer the stagnant pool it was six years ago.  It has\nshaken off its torpid despair, has returned to life, and has become the\nhome of what is called the \"New Unionism;\" that is to say, of the\norganisation of the great mass of \"unskilled\" workers.  This organisation\nmay to a great extent adopt the form of the old Unions of \"skilled\"\nworkers, but it is essentially different in character.  The old Unions\npreserve the traditions of the time when they were founded, and look upon\nthe wages system as a once for all established, final fact, which they at\nbest can modify in the interest of their members.  The new Unions were\nfounded at a time when the faith in the eternity of the wages system was\nseverely shaken; their founders and promoters were Socialists either\nconsciously or by feeling; the masses, whose adhesion gave them strength,\nwere rough, neglected, looked down upon by the working-class aristocracy;\nbut they had this immense advantage, that _their minds were virgin soil_,\nentirely free from the inherited \"respectable\" bourgeois prejudices which\nhampered the brains of the better situated \"old\" Unionists.  And thus we\nsee now these new Unions taking the lead of the working-class movement\ngenerally, and more and more taking in tow the rich and proud \"old\"\nUnions.\n\nUndoubtedly, the East Enders have committed colossal blunders; so have\ntheir predecessors, and so do the doctrinaire Socialists who pooh-pooh\nthem.  A large class, like a great nation, never learns better or quicker\nthan by undergoing the consequences of its own mistakes.  And for all the\nfaults committed in past, present, and future, the revival of the East\nEnd of London remains one of the greatest and most fruitful facts of this\n_fin de siecle_, and glad and proud I am to have lived to see it.\n\nF. ENGELS.\n_January_ 11_th_, 1892.\n\n\n\n\n INTRODUCTION\n\n\nThe history of the proletariat in England begins with the second half of\nthe last century, with the invention of the steam-engine and of machinery\nfor working cotton.  These inventions gave rise, as is well known, to an\nindustrial revolution, a revolution which altered the whole civil\nsociety; one, the historical importance of which is only now beginning to\nbe recognised.  England is the classic soil of this transformation, which\nwas all the mightier, the more silently it proceeded; and England is,\ntherefore, the classic land of its chief product also, the proletariat.\nOnly in England can the proletariat be studied in all its relations and\nfrom all sides.\n\nWe have not, here and now, to deal with the history of this revolution,\nnor with its vast importance for the present and the future.  Such a\ndelineation must be reserved for a future, more comprehensive work.  For\nthe moment, we must limit ourselves to the little that is necessary for\nunderstanding the facts that follow, for comprehending the present state\nof the English proletariat.\n\nBefore the introduction of machinery, the spinning and weaving of raw\nmaterials was carried on in the working-man's home.  Wife and daughter\nspun the yarn that the father wove or that they sold, if he did not work\nit up himself.  These weaver families lived in the country in the\nneighbourhood of the towns, and could get on fairly well with their\nwages, because the home market was almost the only one, and the crushing\npower of competition that came later, with the conquest of foreign\nmarkets and the extension of trade, did not yet press upon wages.  There\nwas, further, a constant increase in the demand for the home market,\nkeeping pace with the slow increase in population and employing all the\nworkers; and there was also the impossibility of vigorous competition of\nthe workers among themselves, consequent upon the rural dispersion of\ntheir homes.  So it was that the weaver was usually in a position to lay\nby something, and rent a little piece of land, that he cultivated in his\nleisure hours, of which he had as many as he chose to take, since he\ncould weave whenever and as long as he pleased.  True, he was a bad\nfarmer and managed his land inefficiently, often obtaining but poor\ncrops; nevertheless, he was no proletarian, he had a stake in the\ncountry, he was permanently settled, and stood one step higher in society\nthan the English workman of to-day.\n\nSo the workers vegetated throughout a passably comfortable existence,\nleading a righteous and peaceful life in all piety and probity; and their\nmaterial position was far better than that of their successors.  They did\nnot need to overwork; they did no more than they chose to do, and yet\nearned what they needed.  They had leisure for healthful work in garden\nor field, work which, in itself, was recreation for them, and they could\ntake part besides in the recreations and games of their neighbours, and\nall these games--bowling, cricket, football, etc., contributed to their\nphysical health and vigour.  They were, for the most part, strong, well-\nbuilt people, in whose physique little or no difference from that of\ntheir peasant neighbours was discoverable.  Their children grew up in the\nfresh country air, and, if they could help their parents at work, it was\nonly occasionally; while of eight or twelve hours work for them there was\nno question.\n\nWhat the moral and intellectual character of this class was may be\nguessed.  Shut off from the towns, which they never entered, their yarn\nand woven stuff being delivered to travelling agents for payment of\nwages--so shut off that old people who lived quite in the neighbourhood\nof the town never went thither until they were robbed of their trade by\nthe introduction of machinery and obliged to look about them in the towns\nfor work--the weavers stood upon the moral and intellectual plane of the\nyeomen with whom they were usually immediately connected through their\nlittle holdings.  They regarded their squire, the greatest landholder of\nthe region, as their natural superior; they asked advice of him, laid\ntheir small disputes before him for settlement, and gave him all honour,\nas this patriarchal relation involved.  They were \"respectable\" people,\ngood husbands and fathers, led moral lives because they had no temptation\nto be immoral, there being no groggeries or low houses in their vicinity,\nand because the host, at whose inn they now and then quenched their\nthirst, was also a respectable man, usually a large tenant farmer who\ntook pride in his good order, good beer, and early hours.  They had their\nchildren the whole day at home, and brought them up in obedience and the\nfear of God; the patriarchal relationship remained undisturbed so long as\nthe children were unmarried.  The young people grew up in idyllic\nsimplicity and intimacy with their playmates until they married; and even\nthough sexual intercourse before marriage almost unfailingly took place,\nthis happened only when the moral obligation of marriage was recognised\non both sides, and a subsequent wedding made everything good.  In short,\nthe English industrial workers of those days lived and thought after the\nfashion still to be found here and there in Germany, in retirement and\nseclusion, without mental activity and without violent fluctuations in\ntheir position in life.  They could rarely read and far more rarely\nwrite; went regularly to church, never talked politics, never conspired,\nnever thought, delighted in physical exercises, listened with inherited\nreverence when the Bible was read, and were, in their unquestioning\nhumility, exceedingly well-disposed towards the \"superior\" classes.  But\nintellectually, they were dead; lived only for their petty, private\ninterest, for their looms and gardens, and knew nothing of the mighty\nmovement which, beyond their horizon, was sweeping through mankind.  They\nwere comfortable in their silent vegetation, and but for the industrial\nrevolution they would never have emerged from this existence, which,\ncosily romantic as it was, was nevertheless not worthy of human beings.\nIn truth, they were not human beings; they were merely toiling machines\nin the service of the few aristocrats who had guided history down to that\ntime.  The industrial revolution has simply carried this out to its\nlogical end by making the workers machines pure and simple, taking from\nthem the last trace of independent activity, and so forcing them to think\nand demand a position worthy of men.  As in France politics, so in\nEngland manufacture, and the movement of civil society in general drew\ninto the whirl of history the last classes which had remained sunk in\napathetic indifference to the universal interests of mankind.\n\nThe first invention which gave rise to a radical change in the state of\nthe English workers was the jenny, invented in the year 1764 by a weaver,\nJames Hargreaves, of Standhill, near Blackburn, in North Lancashire.  This\nmachine was the rough beginning of the later invented mule, and was moved\nby hand.  Instead of one spindle like the ordinary spinning-wheel, it\ncarried sixteen or eighteen manipulated by a single workman.  This\ninvention made it possible to deliver more yarn than heretofore.  Whereas,\nthough one weaver had employed three spinners, there had never been\nenough yarn, and the weaver had often been obliged to wait for it, there\nwas now more yarn to be had than could be woven by the available workers.\nThe demand for woven goods, already increasing, rose yet more in\nconsequence of the cheapness of these goods, which cheapness, in turn,\nwas the outcome of the diminished cost of producing the yarn.  More\nweavers were needed, and weavers' wages rose.  Now that the weaver could\nearn more at his loom, he gradually abandoned his farming, and gave his\nwhole time to weaving.  At that time a family of four grown persons and\ntwo children (who were set to spooling) could earn, with eight hours'\ndaily work, four pounds sterling in a week, and often more if trade was\ngood and work pressed.  It happened often enough that a single weaver\nearned two pounds a week at his loom.  By degrees the class of farming\nweavers wholly disappeared, and was merged in the newly arising class of\nweavers who lived wholly upon wages, had no property whatever, not even\nthe pretended property of a holding, and so became working-men,\nproletarians.  Moreover, the old relation between spinner and weaver was\ndestroyed.  Hitherto, so far as this had been possible, yarn had been\nspun and woven under one roof.  Now that the jenny as well as the loom\nrequired a strong hand, men began to spin, and whole families lived by\nspinning, while others laid the antiquated, superseded spinning-wheel\naside; and, if they had not means of purchasing a jenny, were forced to\nlive upon the wages of the father alone.  Thus began with spinning and\nweaving that division of labour which has since been so infinitely\nperfected.\n\nWhile the industrial proletariat was thus developing with the first still\nvery imperfect machine, the same machine gave rise to the agricultural\nproletariat.  There had, hitherto, been a vast number of small\nlandowners, yeomen, who had vegetated in the same unthinking quiet as\ntheir neighbours, the farming weavers.  They cultivated their scraps of\nland quite after the ancient and inefficient fashion of their ancestors,\nand opposed every change with the obstinacy peculiar to such creatures of\nhabit, after remaining stationary from generation to generation.  Among\nthem were many small holders also, not tenants in the present sense of\nthe word, but people who had their land handed down from their fathers,\neither by hereditary lease, or by force of ancient custom, and had\nhitherto held it as securely as if it had actually been their own\nproperty.  When the industrial workers withdrew from agriculture, a great\nnumber of small holdings fell idle, and upon these the new class of large\ntenants established themselves, tenants-at-will, holding fifty, one\nhundred, two hundred or more acres, liable to be turned out at the end of\nthe year, but able by improved tillage and larger farming to increase the\nyield of the land.  They could sell their produce more cheaply than the\nyeomen, for whom nothing remained when his farm no longer supported him\nbut to sell it, procure a jenny or a loom, or take service as an\nagricultural labourer in the employ of a large farmer.  His inherited\nslowness and the inefficient methods of cultivation bequeathed by his\nancestors, and above which he could not rise, left him no alternative\nwhen forced to compete with men who managed their holdings on sounder\nprinciples and with all the advantages bestowed by farming on a large\nscale and the investment of capital for the improvement of the soil.\n\nMeanwhile, the industrial movement did not stop here.  Single capitalists\nbegan to set up spinning jennies in great buildings and to use\nwater-power for driving them, so placing themselves in a position to\ndiminish the number of workers, and sell their yarn more cheaply than\nsingle spinners could do who moved their own machines by hand.  There\nwere constant improvements in the jenny, so that machines continually\nbecame antiquated, and must be altered or even laid aside; and though the\ncapitalists could hold out by the application of water-power even with\nthe old machinery, for the single spinner this was impossible.  And the\nfactory system, the beginning of which was thus made, received a fresh\nextension in 1767, through the spinning throstle invented by Richard\nArkwright, a barber, in Preston, in North Lancashire.  After the steam-\nengine, this is the most important mechanical invention of the 18th\ncentury.  It was calculated from the beginning for mechanical motive\npower, and was based upon wholly new principles.  By the combination of\nthe peculiarities of the jenny and throstle, Samuel Crompton, of Firwood,\nLancashire, contrived the mule in 1785, and as Arkwright invented the\ncarding engine, and preparatory (\"slubbing and roving\") frames about the\nsame time, the factory system became the prevailing one for the spinning\nof cotton.  By means of trifling modifications these machines were\ngradually adapted to the spinning of flax, and so to the superseding of\nhand-work here, too.  But even then, the end was not yet.  In the closing\nyears of the last century, Dr. Cartwright, a country parson, had invented\nthe power-loom, and about 1804 had so far perfected it, that it could\nsuccessfully compete with the hand-weaver; and all this machinery was\nmade doubly important by James Watt's steam-engine, invented in 1764, and\nused for supplying motive power for spinning since 1785.\n\nWith these inventions, since improved from year to year, the victory of\nmachine-work over hand-work in the chief branches of English industry was\nwon; and the history of the latter from that time forward simply relates\nhow the hand-workers have been driven by machinery from one position\nafter another.  The consequences of this were, on the one hand, a rapid\nfall in price of all manufactured commodities, prosperity of commerce and\nmanufacture, the conquest of nearly all the unprotected foreign markets,\nthe sudden multiplication of capital and national wealth; on the other\nhand, a still more rapid multiplication of the proletariat, the\ndestruction of all property-holding and of all security of employment for\nthe working-class, demoralisation, political excitement, and all those\nfacts so highly repugnant to Englishmen in comfortable circumstances,\nwhich we shall have to consider in the following pages.  Having already\nseen what a transformation in the social condition of the lower classes a\nsingle such clumsy machine as the jenny had wrought, there is no cause\nfor surprise as to that which a complete and interdependent system of\nfinely adjusted machinery has brought about, machinery which receives raw\nmaterial and turns out woven goods.\n\nMeanwhile, let us trace the development of English manufacture {7}\nsomewhat more minutely, beginning with the cotton industry.  In the years\n1771-1775, there were annually imported into England rather less than\n5,000,000 pounds of raw cotton; in the year 1841 there were imported\n528,000,000 pounds, and the import for 1844 will reach at least\n600,000,000 pounds.  In 1834 England exported 556,000,000 yards of woven\ncotton goods, 76,500,000 pounds of cotton yarn, and cotton hosiery of the\nvalue of 1,200,000 pounds.  In the same year over 8,000,000 mule spindles\nwere at work, 110,000 power and 250,000 hand-looms, throstle spindles not\nincluded, in the service of the cotton industry; and, according to\nMacCulloch's reckoning, nearly a million and a half human beings were\nsupported by this branch, of whom but 220,000 worked in the mills; the\npower used in these mills was steam, equivalent to 33,000 horse-power,\nand water, equivalent to 11,000 horse-power.  At present these figures\nare far from adequate, and it may be safely assumed that, in the year\n1845, the power and number of the machines and the number of the workers\nis greater by one-half than it was in 1834.  The chief centre of this\nindustry is Lancashire, where it originated; it has thoroughly\nrevolutionised this county, converting it from an obscure, ill-cultivated\nswamp into a busy, lively region, multiplying its population tenfold in\neighty years, and causing giant cities such as Liverpool and Manchester,\ncontaining together 700,000 inhabitants, and their neighbouring towns,\nBolton with 60,000, Rochdale with 75,000, Oldham with 50,000, Preston\nwith 60,000, Ashton and Stalybridge with 40,000, and a whole list of\nother manufacturing towns to spring up as if by a magic touch.  The\nhistory of South Lancashire contains some of the greatest marvels of\nmodern times, yet no one ever mentions them, and all these miracles are\nthe product of the cotton industry.  Glasgow, too, the centre for the\ncotton district of Scotland, for Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire, has\nincreased in population from 30,000 to 300,000 since the introduction of\nthe industry.  The hosiery manufacture of Nottingham and Derby also\nreceived one fresh impulse from the lower price of yarn, and a second one\nfrom an improvement of the stocking loom, by means of which two stockings\ncould be woven at once.  The manufacture of lace, too, became an\nimportant branch of industry after the invention of the lace machine in\n1777; soon after that date Lindley invented the point-net machine, and in\n1809 Heathcote invented the bobbin-net machine, in consequence of which\nthe production of lace was greatly simplified, and the demand increased\nproportionately in consequence of the diminished cost, so that now, at\nleast 200,000 persons are supported by this industry.  Its chief centres\nare Nottingham, Leicester, and the West of England, Wiltshire,\nDevonshire, etc.  A corresponding extension has taken place in the\nbranches dependent upon the cotton industry, in dyeing, bleaching, and\nprinting.  Bleaching by the application of chlorine in place of the\noxygen of the atmosphere; dyeing and printing by the rapid development of\nchemistry, and printing by a series of most brilliant mechanical\ninventions, a yet greater advance which, with the extension of these\nbranches caused by the growth of the cotton industry, raised them to a\npreviously unknown degree of prosperity.\n\nThe same activity manifested itself in the manufacture of wool.  This had\nhitherto been the leading department of English industry, but the\nquantities formerly produced are as nothing in comparison with that which\nis now manufactured.  In 1782 the whole wool crop of the preceding three\nyears lay unused for want of workers, and would have continued so to lie\nif the newly invented machinery had not come to its assistance and spun\nit.  The adaptation of this machinery to the spinning of wool was most\nsuccessfully accomplished.  Then began the same sudden development in the\nwool district, which we have already seen in the cotton districts.  In\n1738 there were 75,000 pieces of woollen cloth produced in the West\nRiding of Yorkshire; in 1817 there were 490,000 pieces, and so rapid was\nthe extension of the industry that in 1834, 450,000 more pieces were\nproduced than in 1825.  In 1801, 101,000,000 pounds of wool (7,000,000\npounds of it imported) were worked up; in 1835, 180,000,000 pounds were\nworked up; of which 42,000,000 pounds were imported.  The principal\ncentre of this industry is the West Riding of Yorkshire, where,\nespecially at Bradford, long English wool is converted into worsted\nyarns, etc.; while in the other cities, Leeds, Halifax, Huddersfield,\netc., short wool is converted into hard-spun yarn and cloth.  Then come\nthe adjacent part of Lancashire, the region of Rochdale, where in\naddition to the cotton industry much flannel is produced, and the West of\nEngland which supplies the finest cloths.  Here also the growth of\npopulation is worthy of observation:\n\nBradford contained in 1801 29,000, and in 1831 77,000 inhabitants.\nHalifax ,, ,, 68,000, ,, ,, 110,000 ,,\nHuddersfield ,, ,, 15,000, ,, ,, 34,000 ,,\nLeeds,, ,, 53,000, ,, ,, 123,000 ,,\n\nAnd the whole West Riding 564,000, ,, ,, 980,000 ,,\n\nA population which, since 1831, must have increased at least 20 to 25 per\ncent. further.  In 1835 the spinning of wool employed in the United\nKingdom 1,313 mills, with 71,300 workers, these last being but a small\nportion of the multitude who are supported directly or indirectly by the\nmanufacture of wool, and excluding nearly all weavers.\n\nProgress in the linen trade developed later, because the nature of the\nraw material made the application of spinning machinery very difficult.\nAttempts had been made in the last years of the last century in Scotland,\nbut the Frenchman, Girard, who introduced flax spinning in 1810, was the\nfirst who succeeded practically, and even Girard's machines first\nattained on British soil the importance they deserved by means of\nimprovements which they underwent in England, and of their universal\napplication in Leeds, Dundee, and Belfast.  From this time the British\nlinen trade rapidly extended.  In 1814, 3,000 tons of flax were imported;\nin 1833, nearly 19,000 tons of flax and 3,400 tons of hemp.  The export\nof Irish linen to Great Britain rose from 32,000,000 yards in 1800 to\n53,000,000 in 1825, of which a large part was re-exported.  The export of\nEnglish and Scotch woven linen goods rose from 24,000,000 yards in 1820\nto 51,000,000 yards in 1833.  The number of flax spinning establishments\nin 1835 was 347, employing 33,000 workers, of which one-half were in the\nSouth of Scotland, more than 60 in the West Riding of Yorkshire, Leeds,\nand its environs, 25 in Belfast, Ireland, and the rest in Dorset and\nLancashire.  Weaving is carried on in the South of Scotland, here and\nthere in England, but principally in Ireland.\n\nWith like success did the English turn their attention to the manufacture\nof silk.  Raw material was imported from Southern Europe and Asia ready\nspun, and the chief labour lay in the twisting of fine threads.  Until\n1824 the heavy import duty, four shillings per pound on raw material,\ngreatly retarded the development of the English silk industry, while only\nthe markets of England and the Colonies were protected for it.  In that\nyear the duty was reduced to one penny, and the number of mills at once\nlargely increased.  In a single year the number of throwing spindles rose\nfrom 780,000 to 1,180,000; and, although the commercial crisis of 1825\ncrippled this branch of industry for the moment, yet in 1827 more was\nproduced than ever, the mechanical skill and experience of the English\nhaving secured their twisting machinery the supremacy over the awkward\ndevices of their competitors.  In 1835 the British Empire possessed 263\ntwisting mills, employing 30,000 workers, located chiefly in Cheshire, in\nMacclesfield, Congleton, and the surrounding districts, and in Manchester\nand Somersetshire.  Besides these, there are numerous mills for working\nup waste, from which a peculiar article known as spun silk is\nmanufactured, with which the English supply even the Paris and Lyons\nweavers.  The weaving of the silk so twisted and spun is carried on in\nPaisley and elsewhere in Scotland, and in Spitalfields, London, but also\nin Manchester and elsewhere.  Nor is the gigantic advance achieved in\nEnglish manufacture since 1760 restricted to the production of clothing\nmaterials.  The impulse, once given, was communicated to all branches of\nindustrial activity, and a multitude of inventions wholly unrelated to\nthose here cited, received double importance from the fact that they were\nmade in the midst of the universal movement.  But as soon as the\nimmeasurable importance of mechanical power was practically demonstrated,\nevery energy was concentrated in the effort to exploit this power in all\ndirections, and to exploit it in the interest of individual inventors and\nmanufacturers; and the demand for machinery, fuel, and materials called a\nmass of workers and a number of trades into redoubled activity.  The\nsteam-engine first gave importance to the broad coal-fields of England;\nthe production of machinery began now for the first time, and with it\narose a new interest in the iron mines which supplied raw material for\nit.  The increased consumption of wool stimulated English sheep breeding,\nand the growing importation of wool, flax, and silk called forth an\nextension of the British ocean carrying trade.  Greatest of all was the\ngrowth of production of iron.  The rich iron deposits of the English\nhills had hitherto been little developed; iron had always been smelted by\nmeans of charcoal, which became gradually more expensive as agriculture\nimproved and forests were cut away.  The beginning of the use of coke in\niron smelting had been made in the last century, and in 1780 a new method\nwas invented of converting into available wrought-iron coke-smelted iron,\nwhich up to that time had been convertible into cast-iron only.  This\nprocess, known as \"puddling,\" consists in withdrawing the carbon which\nhad mixed with the iron during the process of smelting, and opened a\nwholly new field for the production of English iron.  Smelting furnaces\nwere built fifty times larger than before, the process of smelting was\nsimplified by the introduction of hot blasts, and iron could thus be\nproduced so cheaply that a multitude of objects which had before been\nmade of stone or wood were now made of iron.\n\nIn 1788, Thomas Paine, the famous democrat, built in Yorkshire the first\niron bridge, which was followed by a great number of others, so that now\nnearly all bridges, especially for railroad traffic, are built of cast-\niron, while in London itself a bridge across the Thames, the Southwark\nbridge, has been built of this material.  Iron pillars, supports for\nmachinery, etc., are universally used, and since the introduction of gas-\nlighting and railroads, new outlets for English iron products are opened.\nNails and screws gradually came to be made by machinery.  Huntsman, a\nSheffielder, discovered in 1790 a method for casting steel, by which much\nlabour was saved, and the production of wholly new cheap goods rendered\npracticable; and through the greater purity of the material placed at its\ndisposal, and the more perfect tools, new machinery and minute division\nof labour, the metal trade of England now first attained importance.  The\npopulation of Birmingham grew from 73,000 in 1801 to 200,000 in 1844;\nthat of Sheffield from 46,000 in 1801 to 110,000 in 1844, and the\nconsumption of coal in the latter city alone reached in 1836, 515,000\ntons.  In 1805 there were exported 4,300 tons of iron products and 4,600\ntons of pig-iron; in 1834, 16,200 tons of iron products and 107,000 tons\nof pig-iron, while the whole iron product reaching in 1740 but 17,000\ntons, had risen in 1834 to nearly 700,000 tons.  The smelting of pig-iron\nalone consumes yearly more than 3,000,000 tons of coal, and the\nimportance which coal mining has attained in the course of the last 60\nyears can scarcely be conceived.  All the English and Scotch deposits are\nnow worked, and the mines of Northumberland and Durham alone yield\nannually more than 5,000,000 tons for shipping, and employ from 40 to\n50,000 men.  According to the Durham _Chronicle_, there were worked in\nthese two counties: In 1753, 14 mines; in 1800, 40 mines; in 1836, 76\nmines; in 1843, 130 mines.  Moreover, all mines are now much more\nenergetically worked than formerly.  A similarly increased activity was\napplied to the working of tin, copper, and lead, and alongside of the\nextension of glass manufacture arose a new branch of industry in the\nproduction of pottery, rendered important by the efforts of Josiah\nWedgewood, about 1763.  This inventor placed the whole manufacture of\nstoneware on a scientific basis, introduced better taste, and founded the\npotteries of North Staffordshire, a district of eight English miles\nsquare, which, formerly a desert waste, is now sown with works and\ndwellings, and supports more than 60,000 people.\n\nInto this universal whirl of activity everything was drawn.  Agriculture\nmade a corresponding advance.  Not only did landed property pass, as we\nhave already seen, into the hands of new owners and cultivators,\nagriculture was affected in still another way.  The great holders applied\ncapital to the improvement of the soil, tore down needless fences,\ndrained, manured, employed better tools, and applied a rotation of crops.\nThe progress of science came to their assistance also; Sir Humphrey Davy\napplied chemistry to agriculture with success, and the development of\nmechanical science bestowed a multitude of advantages upon the large\nfarmer.  Further, in consequence of the increase of population, the\ndemand for agricultural products increased in such measure that from 1760\nto 1834, 6,840,540 acres of waste land were reclaimed; and, in spite of\nthis, England was transformed from a grain exporting to a grain importing\ncountry.\n\nThe same activity was developed in the establishment of communication.\nFrom 1818 to 1829, there were built in England and Wales, 1,000 English\nmiles of roadway of the width prescribed by law, 60 feet, and nearly all\nthe old roads were reconstructed on the new system of M'Adam.  In\nScotland, the Department of Public Works built since 1803 nearly 900\nmiles of roadway and more than 1,000 bridges, by which the population of\nthe Highlands was suddenly placed within reach of civilisation.  The\nHighlanders had hitherto been chiefly poachers and smugglers; they now\nbecame farmers and hand-workers.  And, though Gaelic schools were\norganised for the purpose of maintaining the Gaelic language, yet Gaelic-\nCeltic customs and speech are rapidly vanishing before the approach of\nEnglish civilisation.  So, too, in Ireland; between the counties of Cork,\nLimerick, and Kerry, lay hitherto a wilderness wholly without passable\nroads, and serving, by reason of its inaccessibility, as the refuge of\nall criminals and the chief protection of the Celtic Irish nationality in\nthe South of Ireland.  It has now been cut through by public roads, and\ncivilisation has thus gained admission even to this savage region.  The\nwhole British Empire, and especially England, which, sixty years ago, had\nas bad roads as Germany or France then had, is now covered by a network\nof the finest roadways; and these, too, like almost everything else in\nEngland, are the work of private enterprise, the State having done very\nlittle in this direction.\n\nBefore 1755 England possessed almost no canals.  In that year a canal was\nbuilt in Lancashire from Sankey Brook to St Helen's; and in 1759, James\nBrindley built the first important one, the Duke of Bridgewater's canal\nfrom Manchester, and the coal mines of the district to the mouth of the\nMersey passing, near Barton, by aqueduct, over the river Irwell.  From\nthis achievement dates the canal building of England, to which Brindley\nfirst gave importance.  Canals were now built, and rivers made navigable\nin all directions.  In England alone, there are 2,200 miles of canals and\n1,800 miles of navigable river.  In Scotland, the Caledonian Canal was\ncut directly across the country, and in Ireland several canals were\nbuilt.  These improvements, too, like the railroads and roadways, are\nnearly all the work of private individuals and companies.\n\nThe railroads have been only recently built.  The first great one was\nopened from Liverpool to Manchester in 1830, since which all the great\ncities have been connected by rail.  London with Southampton, Brighton,\nDover, Colchester, Exeter, and Birmingham; Birmingham with Gloucester,\nLiverpool, Lancaster (via Newton and Wigan, and via Manchester and\nBolton); also with Leeds (via Manchester and Halifax, and via Leicester,\nDerby, and Sheffield); Leeds with Hull and Newcastle (via York).  There\nare also many minor lines building or projected, which will soon make it\npossible to travel from Edinburgh to London in one day.\n\nAs it had transformed the means of communication by land, so did the\nintroduction of steam revolutionise travel by sea.  The first steamboat\nwas launched in 1807, in the Hudson, in North America; the first in the\nBritish empire, in 1811, on the Clyde.  Since then, more than 600 have\nbeen built in England; and in 1836 more than 500 were plying to and from\nBritish ports.\n\nSuch, in brief, is the history of English industrial development in the\npast sixty years, a history which has no counterpart in the annals of\nhumanity.  Sixty, eighty years ago, England was a country like every\nother, with small towns, few and simple industries, and a thin but\n_proportionally_ large agricultural population.  To-day it is a country\nlike _no_ other, with a capital of two and a half million inhabitants;\nwith vast manufacturing cities; with an industry that supplies the world,\nand produces almost everything by means of the most complex machinery;\nwith an industrious, intelligent, dense population, of which two-thirds\nare employed in trade and commerce, and composed of classes wholly\ndifferent; forming, in fact, with other customs and other needs, a\ndifferent nation from the England of those days.  The industrial\nrevolution is of the same importance for England as the political\nrevolution for France, and the philosophical revolution for Germany; and\nthe difference between England in 1760 and in 1844 is at least as great\nas that between France, under the _ancien regime_ and during the\nrevolution of July.  But the mightiest result of this industrial\ntransformation is the English proletariat.\n\nWe have already seen how the proletariat was called into existence by the\nintroduction of machinery.  The rapid extension of manufacture demanded\nhands, wages rose, and troops of workmen migrated from the agricultural\ndistricts to the towns.  Population multiplied enormously, and nearly all\nthe increase took place in the proletariat.  Further, Ireland had entered\nupon an orderly development only since the beginning of the eighteenth\ncentury.  There, too, the population, more than decimated by English\ncruelty in earlier disturbances, now rapidly multiplied, especially after\nthe advance in manufacture began to draw masses of Irishmen towards\nEngland.  Thus arose the great manufacturing and commercial cities of the\nBritish Empire, in which at least three-fourths of the population belong\nto the working-class, while the lower middle-class consists only of small\nshopkeepers, and very very few handicraftsmen.  For, though the rising\nmanufacture first attained importance by transforming tools into\nmachines, workrooms into factories, and consequently, the toiling lower\nmiddle-class into the toiling proletariat, and the former large merchants\ninto manufacturers, though the lower middle-class was thus early crushed\nout, and the population reduced to the two opposing elements, workers and\ncapitalists, this happened outside of the domain of manufacture proper,\nin the province of handicraft and retail trade as well.  In the place of\nthe former masters and apprentices, came great capitalists and working-\nmen who had no prospect of rising above their class.  Hand-work was\ncarried on after the fashion of factory work, the division of labour was\nstrictly applied, and small employers who could not compete with great\nestablishments were forced down into the proletariat.  At the same time\nthe destruction of the former organisation of hand-work, and the\ndisappearance of the lower middle-class deprived the working-man of all\npossibility of rising into the middle-class himself.  Hitherto he had\nalways had the prospect of establishing himself somewhere as master\nartificer, perhaps employing journeymen and apprentices; but now, when\nmaster artificers were crowded out by manufacturers, when large capital\nhad become necessary for carrying on work independently, the\nworking-class became, for the first time, an integral, permanent class of\nthe population, whereas it had formerly often been merely a transition\nleading to the bourgeoisie.  Now, he who was born to toil had no other\nprospect than that of remaining a toiler all his life.  Now, for the\nfirst time, therefore, the proletariat was in a position to undertake an\nindependent movement.\n\nIn this way were brought together those vast masses of working-men who\nnow fill the whole British Empire, whose social condition forces itself\nevery day more and more upon the attention of the civilised world.  The\ncondition of the working-class is the condition of the vast majority of\nthe English people.  The question: What is to become of those destitute\nmillions, who consume to-day what they earned yesterday; who have created\nthe greatness of England by their inventions and their toil; who become\nwith every passing day more conscious of their might, and demand, with\ndaily increasing urgency, their share of the advantages of society?--This,\nsince the Reform Bill, has become the national question.  All\nParliamentary debates, of any importance, may be reduced to this; and,\nthough the English middle-class will not as yet admit it, though they try\nto evade this great question, and to represent their own particular\ninterests as the truly national ones, their action is utterly useless.\nWith every session of Parliament the working-class gains ground, the\ninterests of the middle-class diminish in importance; and, in spite of\nthe fact that the middle-class is the chief, in fact, the only power in\nParliament, the last session of 1844 was a continuous debate upon\nsubjects affecting the working-class, the Poor Relief Bill, the Factory\nAct, the Masters' and Servants' Act; and Thomas Duncombe, the\nrepresentative of the working-men in the House of Commons, was the great\nman of the session; while the Liberal middle-class with its motion for\nrepealing the Corn Laws, and the Radical middle-class with its resolution\nfor refusing the taxes, played pitiable roles.  Even the debates about\nIreland were at bottom debates about the Irish proletariat, and the means\nof coming to its assistance.  It is high time, too, for the English\nmiddle-class to make some concessions to the working-men who no longer\nplead but threaten; for in a short time it may be too late.\n\nIn spite of all this, the English middle-class, especially the\nmanufacturing class, which is enriched directly by means of the poverty\nof the workers, persists in ignoring this poverty.  This class, feeling\nitself the mighty representative class of the nation, is ashamed to lay\nthe sore spot of England bare before the eyes of the world; will not\nconfess, even to itself, that the workers are in distress, because it,\nthe property-holding, manufacturing class, must bear the moral\nresponsibility for this distress.  Hence the scornful smile which\nintelligent Englishmen (and they, the middle-class, alone are known on\nthe Continent) assume when any one begins to speak of the condition of\nthe working-class; hence the utter ignorance on the part of the whole\nmiddle-class of everything which concerns the workers; hence the\nridiculous blunders which men of this class, in and out of Parliament,\nmake when the position of the proletariat comes under discussion; hence\nthe absurd freedom from anxiety, with which the middle-class dwells upon\na soil that is honeycombed, and may any day collapse, the speedy collapse\nof which is as certain as a mathematical or mechanical demonstration;\nhence the miracle that the English have as yet no single book upon the\ncondition of their workers, although they have been examining and mending\nthe old state of things no one knows how many years.  Hence also the deep\nwrath of the whole working-class, from Glasgow to London, against the\nrich, by whom they are systematically plundered and mercilessly left to\ntheir fate, a wrath which before too long a time goes by, a time almost\nwithin the power of man to predict, must break out into a Revolution in\ncomparison with which the French Revolution, and the year 1794, will\nprove to have been child's play.\n\n\n\n\nTHE INDUSTRIAL PROLETARIAT.\n\n\nThe order of our investigation of the different sections of the\nproletariat follows naturally from the foregoing history of its rise.  The\nfirst proletarians were connected with manufacture, were engendered by\nit, and accordingly, those employed in manufacture, in the working up of\nraw materials, will first claim our attention.  The production of raw\nmaterials and of fuel for manufacture attained importance only in\nconsequence of the industrial change, and engendered a new proletariat,\nthe coal and metal miners.  Then, in the third place, manufacture\ninfluenced agriculture, and in the fourth, the condition of Ireland; and\nthe fractions of the proletariat belonging to each, will find their place\naccordingly.  We shall find, too, that with the possible exception of the\nIrish, the degree of intelligence of the various workers is in direct\nproportion to their relation to manufacture; and that the factory hands\nare most enlightened as to their own interests, the miners somewhat less\nso, the agricultural labourers scarcely at all.  We shall find the same\norder again among the industrial workers, and shall see how the factory\nhands, eldest children of the industrial revolution, have from the\nbeginning to the present day formed the nucleus of the Labour Movement,\nand how the others have joined this movement just in proportion as their\nhandicraft has been invaded by the progress of machinery.  We shall thus\nlearn from the example which England offers, from the equal pace which\nthe Labour Movement has kept with the movement of industrial development,\nthe historical significance of manufacture.\n\nSince, however, at the present moment, pretty much the whole industrial\nproletariat is involved in the movement, and the condition of the\nseparate sections has much in common, because they all are industrial, we\nshall have first to examine the condition of the industrial proletariat\nas a whole, in order later to notice more particularly each separate\ndivision with its own peculiarities.\n\nIt has been already suggested that manufacture centralises property in\nthe hands of the few.  It requires large capital with which to erect the\ncolossal establishments that ruin the petty trading bourgeoisie and with\nwhich to press into its service the forces of Nature, so driving the hand\nlabour of the independent workman out of the market.  The division of\nlabour, the application of water and especially steam, and the\napplication of machinery, are the three great levers with which\nmanufacture, since the middle of the last century, has been busy putting\nthe world out of joint.  Manufacture, on a small scale, created the\nmiddle-class; on a large scale, it created the working-class, and raised\nthe elect of the middle-class to the throne, but only to overthrow them\nthe more surely when the time comes.  Meanwhile, it is an undenied and\neasily explained fact that the numerous, petty middle-class of the \"good\nold times\" has been annihilated by manufacture, and resolved into rich\ncapitalists on the one hand and poor workers on the other. {20}\n\nThe centralising tendency of manufacture does not, however, stop here.\nPopulation becomes centralised just as capital does; and, very naturally,\nsince the human being, the worker, is regarded in manufacture simply as a\npiece of capital for the use of which the manufacturer pays interest\nunder the name of wages.  A manufacturing establishment requires many\nworkers employed together in a single building, living near each other\nand forming a village of themselves in the case of a good-sized factory.\nThey have needs for satisfying which other people are necessary;\nhandicraftsmen, shoemakers, tailors, bakers, carpenters, stonemasons,\nsettle at hand.  The inhabitants of the village, especially the younger\ngeneration, accustom themselves to factory work, grow skilful in it, and\nwhen the first mill can no longer employ them all, wages fall, and the\nimmigration of fresh manufacturers is the consequence.  So the village\ngrows into a small town, and the small town into a large one.  The\ngreater the town, the greater its advantages.  It offers roads,\nrailroads, canals; the choice of skilled labour increases constantly, new\nestablishments can be built more cheaply because of the competition among\nbuilders and machinists who are at hand, than in remote country\ndistricts, whither timber, machinery, builders, and operatives must be\nbrought; it offers a market to which buyers crowd, and direct\ncommunication with the markets supplying raw material or demanding\nfinished goods.  Hence the marvellously rapid growth of the great\nmanufacturing towns.  The country, on the other hand, has the advantage\nthat wages are usually lower than in town, and so town and country are in\nconstant competition; and, if the advantage is on the side of the town to-\nday, wages sink so low in the country to-morrow, that new investments are\nmost profitably made there.  But the centralising tendency of manufacture\ncontinues in full force, and every new factory built in the country bears\nin it the germ of a manufacturing town.  If it were possible for this mad\nrush of manufacture to go on at this rate for another century, every\nmanufacturing district of England would be one great manufacturing town,\nand Manchester and Liverpool would meet at Warrington or Newton; for in\ncommerce, too, this centralisation of the population works in precisely\nthe same way, and hence it is that one or two great harbours, such as\nHull and Liverpool, Bristol, and London, monopolise almost the whole\nmaritime commerce of Great Britain.\n\nSince commerce and manufacture attain their most complete development in\nthese great towns, their influence upon the proletariat is also most\nclearly observable here.  Here the centralisation of property has reached\nthe highest point; here the morals and customs of the good old times are\nmost completely obliterated; here it has gone so far that the name Merry\nOld England conveys no meaning, for Old England itself is unknown to\nmemory and to the tales of our grandfathers.  Hence, too, there exist\nhere only a rich and a poor class, for the lower middle-class vanishes\nmore completely with every passing day.  Thus the class formerly most\nstable has become the most restless one.  It consists to-day of a few\nremnants of a past time, and a number of people eager to make fortunes,\nindustrial Micawbers and speculators of whom one may amass a fortune,\nwhile ninety-nine become insolvent, and more than half of the ninety-nine\nlive by perpetually repeated failure.\n\nBut in these towns the proletarians are the infinite majority, and how\nthey fare, what influence the great town exercises upon them, we have now\nto investigate.\n\n\n\n\nTHE GREAT TOWNS.\n\n\nA town, such as London, where a man may wander for hours together without\nreaching the beginning of the end, without meeting the slightest hint\nwhich could lead to the inference that there is open country within\nreach, is a strange thing.  This colossal centralisation, this heaping\ntogether of two and a half millions of human beings at one point, has\nmultiplied the power of this two and a half millions a hundredfold; has\nraised London to the commercial capital of the world, created the giant\ndocks and assembled the thousand vessels that continually cover the\nThames.  I know nothing more imposing than the view which the Thames\noffers during the ascent from the sea to London Bridge.  The masses of\nbuildings, the wharves on both sides, especially from Woolwich upwards,\nthe countless ships along both shores, crowding ever closer and closer\ntogether, until, at last, only a narrow passage remains in the middle of\nthe river, a passage through which hundreds of steamers shoot by one\nanother; all this is so vast, so impressive, that a man cannot collect\nhimself, but is lost in the marvel of England's greatness before he sets\nfoot upon English soil. {23}\n\nBut the sacrifices which all this has cost become apparent later.  After\nroaming the streets of the capital a day or two, making headway with\ndifficulty through the human turmoil and the endless lines of vehicles,\nafter visiting the slums of the metropolis, one realises for the first\ntime that these Londoners have been forced to sacrifice the best\nqualities of their human nature, to bring to pass all the marvels of\ncivilisation which crowd their city; that a hundred powers which\nslumbered within them have remained inactive, have been suppressed in\norder that a few might be developed more fully and multiply through union\nwith those of others.  The very turmoil of the streets has something\nrepulsive, something against which human nature rebels.  The hundreds of\nthousands of all classes and ranks crowding past each other, are they not\nall human beings with the same qualities and powers, and with the same\ninterest in being happy?  And have they not, in the end, to seek\nhappiness in the same way, by the same means?  And still they crowd by\none another as though they had nothing in common, nothing to do with one\nanother, and their only agreement is the tacit one, that each keep to his\nown side of the pavement, so as not to delay the opposing streams of the\ncrowd, while it occurs to no man to honour another with so much as a\nglance.  The brutal indifference, the unfeeling isolation of each in his\nprivate interest becomes the more repellant and offensive, the more these\nindividuals are crowded together, within a limited space.  And, however\nmuch one may be aware that this isolation of the individual, this narrow\nself-seeking is the fundamental principle of our society everywhere, it\nis nowhere so shamelessly barefaced, so self-conscious as just here in\nthe crowding of the great city.  The dissolution of mankind into monads,\nof which each one has a separate principle, the world of atoms, is here\ncarried out to its utmost extreme.\n\nHence it comes, too, that the social war, the war of each against all, is\nhere openly declared.  Just as in Stirner's recent book, people regard\neach other only as useful objects; each exploits the other, and the end\nof it all is, that the stronger treads the weaker under foot, and that\nthe powerful few, the capitalists, seize everything for themselves, while\nto the weak many, the poor, scarcely a bare existence remains.\n\nWhat is true of London, is true of Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, is true\nof all great towns.  Everywhere barbarous indifference, hard egotism on\none hand, and nameless misery on the other, everywhere social warfare,\nevery man's house in a state of siege, everywhere reciprocal plundering\nunder the protection of the law, and all so shameless, so openly avowed\nthat one shrinks before the consequences of our social state as they\nmanifest themselves here undisguised, and can only wonder that the whole\ncrazy fabric still hangs together.\n\nSince capital, the direct or indirect control of the means of subsistence\nand production, is the weapon with which this social warfare is carried\non, it is clear that all the disadvantages of such a state must fall upon\nthe poor.  For him no man has the slightest concern.  Cast into the\nwhirlpool, he must struggle through as well as he can.  If he is so happy\nas to find work, _i.e_., if the bourgeoisie does him the favour to enrich\nitself by means of him, wages await him which scarcely suffice to keep\nbody and soul together; if he can get no work he may steal, if he is not\nafraid of the police, or starve, in which case the police will take care\nthat he does so in a quiet and inoffensive manner.  During my residence\nin England, at least twenty or thirty persons have died of simple\nstarvation under the most revolting circumstances, and a jury has rarely\nbeen found possessed of the courage to speak the plain truth in the\nmatter.  Let the testimony of the witnesses be never so clear and\nunequivocal, the bourgeoisie, from which the jury is selected, always\nfinds some backdoor through which to escape the frightful verdict, death\nfrom starvation.  The bourgeoisie dare not speak the truth in these\ncases, for it would speak its own condemnation.  But indirectly, far more\nthan directly, many have died of starvation, where long continued want of\nproper nourishment has called forth fatal illness, when it has produced\nsuch debility that causes which might otherwise have remained\ninoperative, brought on severe illness and death.  The English working-\nmen call this \"social murder,\" and accuse our whole society of\nperpetrating this crime perpetually.  Are they wrong?\n\nTrue, it is only individuals who starve, but what security has the\nworking-man that it may not be his turn to-morrow?  Who assures him\nemployment, who vouches for it that, if for any reason or no reason his\nlord and master discharges him to-morrow, he can struggle along with\nthose dependent upon him, until he may find some one else \"to give him\nbread?\"  Who guarantees that willingness to work shall suffice to obtain\nwork, that uprightness, industry, thrift, and the rest of the virtues\nrecommended by the bourgeoisie, are really his road to happiness?  No\none.  He knows that he has something to-day, and that it does not depend\nupon himself whether he shall have something to-morrow.  He knows that\nevery breeze that blows, every whim of his employer, every bad turn of\ntrade may hurl him back into the fierce whirlpool from which he has\ntemporarily saved himself, and in which it is hard and often impossible\nto keep his head above water.  He knows that, though he may have the\nmeans of living to-day, it is very uncertain whether he shall to-morrow.\n\nMeanwhile, let us proceed to a more detailed investigation of the\nposition, in which the social war has placed the non-possessing class.\nLet us see what pay for his work society does give the working-man in the\nform of dwelling, clothing, food, what sort of subsistence it grants\nthose who contribute most to the maintenance of society; and, first, let\nus consider the dwellings.\n\nEvery great city has one or more slums, where the working-class is\ncrowded together.  True, poverty often dwells in hidden alleys close to\nthe palaces of the rich; but, in general, a separate territory has been\nassigned to it, where, removed from the sight of the happier classes, it\nmay struggle along as it can.  These slums are pretty equally arranged in\nall the great towns of England, the worst houses in the worst quarters of\nthe towns; usually one or two-storied cottages in long rows, perhaps with\ncellars used as dwellings, almost always irregularly built.  These houses\nof three or four rooms and a kitchen form, throughout England, some parts\nof London excepted, the general dwellings of the working-class.  The\nstreets are generally unpaved, rough, dirty, filled with vegetable and\nanimal refuse, without sewers or gutters, but supplied with foul,\nstagnant pools instead.  Moreover, ventilation is impeded by the bad,\nconfused method of building of the whole quarter, and since many human\nbeings here live crowded into a small space, the atmosphere that prevails\nin these working-men's quarters may readily be imagined.  Further, the\nstreets serve as drying grounds in fine weather; lines are stretched\nacross from house to house, and hung with wet clothing.\n\nLet us investigate some of the slums in their order.  London comes first,\nand in London the famous rookery of St. Giles which is now, at last,\nabout to be penetrated by a couple of broad streets.  St. Giles is in the\nmidst of the most populous part of the town, surrounded by broad,\nsplendid avenues in which the gay world of London idles about, in the\nimmediate neighbourhood of Oxford Street, Regent Street, of Trafalgar\nSquare and the Strand.  It is a disorderly collection of tall, three or\nfour-storied houses, with narrow, crooked, filthy streets, in which there\nis quite as much life as in the great thoroughfares of the town, except\nthat, here, people of the working-class only are to be seen.  A vegetable\nmarket is held in the street, baskets with vegetables and fruits,\nnaturally all bad and hardly fit to use, obstruct the sidewalk still\nfurther, and from these, as well as from the fish-dealers' stalls, arises\na horrible smell.  The houses are occupied from cellar to garret, filthy\nwithin and without, and their appearance is such that no human being\ncould possibly wish to live in them.  But all this is nothing in\ncomparison with the dwellings in the narrow courts and alleys between the\nstreets, entered by covered passages between the houses, in which the\nfilth and tottering ruin surpass all description.  Scarcely a whole\nwindow-pane can be found, the walls are crumbling, door-posts and window-\nframes loose and broken, doors of old boards nailed together, or\naltogether wanting in this thieves' quarter, where no doors are needed,\nthere being nothing to steal.  Heaps of garbage and ashes lie in all\ndirections, and the foul liquids emptied before the doors gather in\nstinking pools.  Here live the poorest of the poor, the worst paid\nworkers with thieves and the victims of prostitution indiscriminately\nhuddled together, the majority Irish, or of Irish extraction, and those\nwho have not yet sunk in the whirlpool of moral ruin which surrounds\nthem, sinking daily deeper, losing daily more and more of their power to\nresist the demoralising influence of want, filth, and evil surroundings.\n\nNor is St. Giles the only London slum.  In the immense tangle of streets,\nthere are hundreds and thousands of alleys and courts lined with houses\ntoo bad for anyone to live in, who can still spend anything whatsoever\nupon a dwelling fit for human beings.  Close to the splendid houses of\nthe rich such a lurking-place of the bitterest poverty may often be\nfound.  So, a short time ago, on the occasion of a coroner's inquest, a\nregion close to Portman Square, one of the very respectable squares, was\ncharacterised as an abode \"of a multitude of Irish demoralised by poverty\nand filth.\"  So, too, may be found in streets, such as Long Acre and\nothers, which, though not fashionable, are yet \"respectable,\" a great\nnumber of cellar dwellings out of which puny children and half-starved,\nragged women emerge into the light of day.  In the immediate\nneighbourhood of Drury Lane Theatre, the second in London, are some of\nthe worst streets of the whole metropolis, Charles, King, and Park\nStreets, in which the houses are inhabited from cellar to garret\nexclusively by poor families.  In the parishes of St. John and St.\nMargaret there lived in 1840, according to the _Journal of the\nStatistical Society_, 5,366 working-men's families in 5,294 \"dwellings\"\n(if they deserve the name!), men, women, and children thrown together\nwithout distinction of age or sex, 26,830 persons all told; and of these\nfamilies three-fourths possessed but one room.  In the aristocratic\nparish of St. George, Hanover Square, there lived, according to the same\nauthority, 1,465 working-men's families, nearly 6,000 persons, under\nsimilar conditions, and here, too, more than two-thirds of the whole\nnumber crowded together at the rate of one family in one room.  And how\nthe poverty of these unfortunates, among whom even thieves find nothing\nto steal, is exploited by the property-holding class in lawful ways!  The\nabominable dwellings in Drury Lane, just mentioned, bring in the\nfollowing rents: two cellar dwellings, 3s.; one room, ground-floor, 4s.;\nsecond-storey, 4s. 6d.; third-floor, 4s.; garret-room, 3s. weekly, so\nthat the starving occupants of Charles Street alone, pay the house-owners\na yearly tribute of 2,000 pounds, and the 5,336 families above mentioned\nin Westminster, a yearly rent of 40,000 pounds.\n\nThe most extensive working-people's district lies east of the Tower in\nWhitechapel and Bethnal Green, where the greatest masses of London\nworking-people live.  Let us hear Mr. G. Alston, preacher of St.\nPhilip's, Bethnal Green, on the condition of his parish.  He says:\n\n   \"It contains 1,400 houses, inhabited by 2,795 families, or about\n   12,000 persons.  The space upon which this large population dwells, is\n   less than 400 yards (1,200 feet) square, and in this overcrowding it\n   is nothing unusual to find a man, his wife, four or five children,\n   and, sometimes, both grandparents, all in one single room, where they\n   eat, sleep, and work.  I believe that before the Bishop of London\n   called attention to this most poverty-stricken parish, people at the\n   West End knew as little of it as of the savages of Australia or the\n   South Sea Isles.  And if we make ourselves acquainted with these\n   unfortunates, through personal observation, if we watch them at their\n   scanty meal and see them bowed by illness and want of work, we shall\n   find such a mass of helplessness and misery, that a nation like ours\n   must blush that these things can be possible.  I was rector near\n   Huddersfield during the three years in which the mills were at their\n   worst, but I have never seen such complete helplessness of the poor as\n   since then in Bethnal Green.  Not one father of a family in ten in the\n   whole neighbourhood has other clothing than his working suit, and that\n   is as bad and tattered as possible; many, indeed, have no other\n   covering for the night than these rags, and no bed, save a sack of\n   straw and shavings.\"\n\nThe foregoing description furnishes an idea of the aspect of the interior\nof the dwellings.  But let us follow the English officials, who\noccasionally stray thither, into one or two of these working-men's homes.\n\nOn the occasion of an inquest held Nov. 14th, 1843, by Mr. Carter,\ncoroner for Surrey, upon the body of Ann Galway, aged 45 years, the\nnewspapers related the following particulars concerning the deceased: She\nhad lived at No. 3 White Lion Court, Bermondsey Street, London, with her\nhusband and a nineteen-year-old son in a little room, in which neither a\nbedstead nor any other furniture was to be seen.  She lay dead beside her\nson upon a heap of feathers which were scattered over her almost naked\nbody, there being neither sheet nor coverlet.  The feathers stuck so fast\nover the whole body that the physician could not examine the corpse until\nit was cleansed, and then found it starved and scarred from the bites of\nvermin.  Part of the floor of the room was torn up, and the hole used by\nthe family as a privy.\n\nOn Monday, Jan. 15th, 1844, two boys were brought before the police\nmagistrate because, being in a starving condition, they had stolen and\nimmediately devoured a half-cooked calf's foot from a shop.  The\nmagistrate felt called upon to investigate the case further, and received\nthe following details from the policeman: The mother of the two boys was\nthe widow of an ex-soldier, afterwards policeman, and had had a very hard\ntime since the death of her husband, to provide for her nine children.\nShe lived at No. 2 Pool's Place, Quaker Court, Spitalfields, in the\nutmost poverty.  When the policeman came to her, he found her with six of\nher children literally huddled together in a little back room, with no\nfurniture but two old rush-bottomed chairs with the seats gone, a small\ntable with two legs broken, a broken cup, and a small dish.  On the\nhearth was scarcely a spark of fire, and in one corner lay as many old\nrags as would fill a woman's apron, which served the whole family as a\nbed.  For bed clothing they had only their scanty day clothing.  The poor\nwoman told him that she had been forced to sell her bedstead the year\nbefore to buy food.  Her bedding she had pawned with the victualler for\nfood.  In short, everything had gone for food.  The magistrate ordered\nthe woman a considerable provision from the poor-box.\n\nIn February, 1844, Theresa Bishop, a widow 60 years old, was recommended,\nwith her sick daughter, aged 26, to the compassion of the police\nmagistrate in Marlborough Street.  She lived at No. 5 Brown Street,\nGrosvenor Square, in a small back room no larger than a closet, in which\nthere was not one single piece of furniture.  In one corner lay some rags\nupon which both slept; a chest served as table and chair.  The mother\nearned a little by charring.  The owner of the house said that they had\nlived in this way since May, 1843, had gradually sold or pawned\neverything that they had, and had still never paid any rent.  The\nmagistrate assigned them 1 pound from the poor-box.\n\nI am far from asserting that _all_ London working-people live in such\nwant as the foregoing three families.  I know very well that ten are\nsomewhat better off, where one is so totally trodden under foot by\nsociety; but I assert that thousands of industrious and worthy people--far\nworthier and more to be respected than all the rich of London--do find\nthemselves in a condition unworthy of human beings; and that every\nproletarian, everyone, without exception, is exposed to a similar fate\nwithout any fault of his own and in spite of every possible effort.\n\nBut in spite of all this, they who have some kind of a shelter are\nfortunate, fortunate in comparison with the utterly homeless.  In London\nfifty thousand human beings get up every morning, not knowing where they\nare to lay their heads at night.  The luckiest of this multitude, those\nwho succeed in keeping a penny or two until evening, enter a\nlodging-house, such as abound in every great city, where they find a bed.\nBut what a bed!  These houses are filled with beds from cellar to garret,\nfour, five, six beds in a room; as many as can be crowded in.  Into every\nbed four, five, or six human beings are piled, as many as can be packed\nin, sick and well, young and old, drunk and sober, men and women, just as\nthey come, indiscriminately.  Then come strife, blows, wounds, or, if\nthese bedfellows agree, so much the worse; thefts are arranged and things\ndone which our language, grown more humane than our deeds, refuses to\nrecord.  And those who cannot pay for such a refuge?  They sleep where\nthey find a place, in passages, arcades, in corners where the police and\nthe owners leave them undisturbed.  A few individuals find their way to\nthe refuges which are managed, here and there, by private charity, others\nsleep on the benches in the parks close under the windows of Queen\nVictoria.  Let us hear the London _Times_:\n\n   \"It appears from the report of the proceedings at Marlborough Street\n   Police Court in our columns of yesterday, that there is an average\n   number of 50 human beings of all ages, who huddle together in the\n   parks every night, having no other shelter than what is supplied by\n   the trees and a few hollows of the embankment.  Of these, the majority\n   are young girls who have been seduced from the country by the soldiers\n   and turned loose on the world in all the destitution of friendless\n   penury, and all the recklessness of early vice.\n\n   \"This is truly horrible!  Poor there must be everywhere.  Indigence\n   will find its way and set up its hideous state in the heart of a great\n   and luxurious city.  Amid the thousand narrow lanes and by-streets of\n   a populous metropolis there must always, we fear, be much\n   suffering--much that offends the eye--much that lurks unseen.\n\n   \"But that within the precincts of wealth, gaiety, and fashion, nigh\n   the regal grandeur of St. James, close on the palatial splendour of\n   Bayswater, on the confines of the old and new aristocratic quarters,\n   in a district where the cautious refinement of modern design has\n   refrained from creating one single tenement for poverty; which seems,\n   as it were, dedicated to the exclusive enjoyment of wealth, that\n   _there_ want, and famine, and disease, and vice should stalk in all\n   their kindred horrors, consuming body by body, soul, by soul!\n\n   \"It is indeed a monstrous state of things!  Enjoyment the most\n   absolute, that bodily ease, intellectual excitement, or the more\n   innocent pleasures of sense can supply to man's craving, brought in\n   close contact with the most unmitigated misery!  Wealth, from its\n   bright saloons, laughing--an insolently heedless laugh--at the unknown\n   wounds of want!  Pleasure, cruelly but unconsciously mocking the pain\n   that moans below!  All contrary things mocking one another--all\n   contrary, save the vice which tempts and the vice which is tempted!\n\n   \"But let all men remember this--that within the most courtly precincts\n   of the richest city of God's earth, there may be found, night after\n   night, winter after winter, women--young in years--old in sin and\n   suffering--outcasts from society--ROTTING FROM FAMINE, FILTH, AND\n   DISEASE.  Let them remember this, and learn not to theorise but to\n   act.  God knows, there is much room for action nowadays.\" {32}\n\nI have referred to the refuges for the homeless.  How greatly overcrowded\nthese are, two examples may show.  A newly erected Refuge for the\nHouseless in Upper Ogle Street, that can shelter three hundred persons\nevery night, has received since its opening, January 27th to March 17th,\n1844, 2,740 persons for one or more nights; and, although the season was\ngrowing more favourable, the number of applicants in this, as well as in\nthe asylums of Whitecross Street and Wapping, was strongly on the\nincrease, and a crowd of the homeless had to be sent away every night for\nwant of room.  In another refuge, the Central Asylum in Playhouse Yard,\nthere were supplied on an average 460 beds nightly, during the first\nthree months of the year 1844, 6,681 persons being sheltered, and 96,141\nportions of bread were distributed.  Yet the committee of directors\ndeclare this institution began to meet the pressure of the needy to a\nlimited extent only when the Eastern Asylum also was opened.\n\nLet us leave London and examine the other great cities of the three\nkingdoms in their order.  Let us take Dublin first, a city the approach\nto which from the sea is as charming as that of London is imposing.  The\nBay of Dublin is the most beautiful of the whole British Island Kingdom,\nand is even compared by the Irish with the Bay of Naples.  The city, too,\npossesses great attractions, and its aristocratic districts are better\nand more tastefully laid out than those of any other British city.  By\nway of compensation, however, the poorer districts of Dublin are among\nthe most hideous and repulsive to be seen in the world.  True, the Irish\ncharacter, which, under some circumstances, is comfortable only in the\ndirt, has some share in this; but as we find thousands of Irish in every\ngreat city in England and Scotland, and as every poor population must\ngradually sink into the same uncleanliness, the wretchedness of Dublin is\nnothing specific, nothing peculiar to Dublin, but something common to all\ngreat towns.  The poor quarters of Dublin are extremely extensive, and\nthe filth, the uninhabitableness of the houses and the neglect of the\nstreets, surpass all description.  Some idea of the manner in which the\npoor are here crowded together may be formed from the fact that, in 1817,\naccording to the report of the Inspector of Workhouses, {33} 1,318\npersons lived in 52 houses with 390 rooms in Barral Street, and 1,997\npersons in 71 houses with 393 rooms in and near Church Street; that:\n\n   \"In this and the adjoining district there exists a multitude of foul\n   courts and alleys; many cellars receive all their light through the\n   door, while in not a few the inhabitants sleep upon the bare floor,\n   though most of them possess bedsteads at least; Nicholson's Court, for\n   example, contains twenty-eight wretched little rooms with 151 human\n   beings in the greatest want, there being but two bedsteads and two\n   blankets to be found in the whole court.\"\n\nThe poverty is so great in Dublin, that a single benevolent institution,\nthe Mendicity Association, gives relief to 2,500 persons or one per cent.\nof the population daily, receiving and feeding them for the day and\ndismissing them at night.\n\nDr. Alison describes a similar state of things in Edinburgh, whose superb\nsituation, which has won it the title of the Modern Athens, and whose\nbrilliant aristocratic quarter in the New Town, contrast strongly with\nthe foul wretchedness of the poor in the Old Town.  Alison asserts that\nthis extensive quarter is as filthy and horrible as the worst district of\nDublin, while the Mendicity Association would have as great a proportion\nof needy persons to assist in Edinburgh as in the Irish capital.  He\nasserts, indeed, that the poor in Scotland, especially in Edinburgh and\nGlasgow, are worse off than in any other region of the three kingdoms,\nand that the poorest are not Irish, but Scotch.  The preacher of the Old\nChurch of Edinburgh, Dr. Lee, testified in 1836, before the Commission of\nReligious Instruction, that:\n\n   \"He had never before seen such misery as in his parish, where the\n   people were without furniture, without everything, two married couples\n   often sharing one room.  In a single day he had visited seven houses\n   in which there was not a bed, in some of them not even a heap of\n   straw.  Old people of eighty years sleep on the board floor, nearly\n   all slept in their day-clothes.  In one cellar room he found two\n   families from a Scotch country district; soon after their removal to\n   the city two of the children had died, and a third was dying at the\n   time of his visit.  Each family had a filthy pile of straw lying in a\n   corner; the cellar sheltered besides the two families a donkey, and\n   was, moreover, so dark that it was impossible to distinguish one\n   person from another by day.  Dr. Lee declared that it was enough to\n   make a heart of adamant bleed to see such misery in a country like\n   Scotland.\"\n\nIn the Edinburgh _Medical and Surgical Journal_, Dr. Hennan reports a\nsimilar state of things.  From a Parliamentary Report, {35a} it is\nevident that in the dwellings of the poor of Edinburgh a want of\ncleanliness reigns, such as must be expected under these conditions.  On\nthe bed-posts chickens roost at night, dogs and horses share the\ndwellings of human beings, and the natural consequence is a shocking\nstench, with filth and swarms of vermin.  The prevailing construction of\nEdinburgh favours these atrocious conditions as far as possible.  The Old\nTown is built upon both slopes of a hill, along the crest of which runs\nthe High Street.  Out of the High Street there open downwards multitudes\nof narrow, crooked alleys, called wynds from their many turnings, and\nthese wynds form the proletarian district of the city.  The houses of the\nScotch cities, in general, are five or six-storied buildings, like those\nof Paris, and in contrast with England where, so far as possible, each\nfamily has a separate house.  The crowding of human beings upon a limited\narea is thus intensified. {35b}\n\n   \"These streets,\" says an English journal in an article upon the\n   sanitary condition of the working-people in cities, \"are often so\n   narrow that a person can step from the window of one house into that\n   of its opposite neighbour, while the houses are piled so high, storey\n   upon storey, that the light can scarcely penetrate into the court or\n   alley that lies between.  In this part of the city there are neither\n   sewers nor other drains, nor even privies belonging to the houses.  In\n   consequence, all refuse, garbage, and excrements of at least 50,000\n   persons are thrown into the gutters every night, so that, in spite of\n   all street sweeping, a mass of dried filth and foul vapours are\n   created, which not only offend the sight and smell, but endanger the\n   health of the inhabitants in the highest degree.  Is it to be wondered\n   at, that in such localities all considerations of health, morals, and\n   even the most ordinary decency are utterly neglected?  On the\n   contrary, all who are more intimately acquainted with the condition of\n   the inhabitants will testify to the high degree which disease,\n   wretchedness, and demoralisation have here reached.  Society in such\n   districts has sunk to a level indescribably low and hopeless.  The\n   houses of the poor are generally filthy, and are evidently never\n   cleansed.  They consist in most cases of a single room which, while\n   subject to the worst ventilation, is yet usually kept cold by the\n   broken and badly fitting windows, and is sometimes damp and partly\n   below ground level, always badly furnished and thoroughly\n   uncomfortable, a straw-heap often serving the whole family for a bed,\n   upon which men and women, young and old, sleep in revolting confusion.\n   Water can be had only from the public pumps, and the difficulty of\n   obtaining it naturally fosters all possible filth.\"\n\nIn the other great seaport towns the prospect is no better.  Liverpool,\nwith all its commerce, wealth, and grandeur yet treats its workers with\nthe same barbarity.  A full fifth of the population, more than 45,000\nhuman beings, live in narrow, dark, damp, badly-ventilated cellar\ndwellings, of which there are 7,862 in the city.  Besides these cellar\ndwellings there are 2,270 courts, small spaces built up on all four sides\nand having but one entrance, a narrow, covered passage-way, the whole\nordinarily very dirty and inhabited exclusively by proletarians.  Of such\ncourts we shall have more to say when we come to Manchester.  In Bristol,\non one occasion, 2,800 families were visited, of whom 46 per cent.\noccupied but one room each.\n\nPrecisely the same state of things prevails in the factory towns.  In\nNottingham there are in all 11,000 houses, of which between 7,000 and\n8,000 are built back to back with a rear parti-wall so that no through\nventilation is possible, while a single privy usually serves for several\nhouses.  During an investigation made a short time since, many rows of\nhouses were found to have been built over shallow drains covered only by\nthe boards of the ground floor.  In Leicester, Derby, and Sheffield, it\nis no better.  Of Birmingham, the article above cited from the _Artisan_\nstates:\n\n   \"In the older quarters of the city there are many bad districts,\n   filthy and neglected, full of stagnant pools and heaps of refuse.\n   Courts are very numerous in Birmingham, reaching two thousand, and\n   containing the greater number of the working-people of the city.  These\n   courts are usually narrow, muddy, badly ventilated, ill-drained, and\n   lined with eight to twenty houses, which, by reason of having their\n   rear walls in common, can usually be ventilated from one side only.  In\n   the background, within the court, there is usually an ash heap or\n   something of the kind, the filth of which cannot be described.  It\n   must, however, be observed that the newer courts are more sensibly\n   built and more decently kept, and that even in the old ones, the\n   cottages are much less crowded than in Manchester and Liverpool,\n   wherefore Birmingham shows even during the reign of an epidemic a far\n   smaller mortality than, for instance, Wolverhampton, Dudley, and\n   Bilston, only a few miles distant.  Cellar dwellings are unknown, too,\n   in Birmingham, though a few cellars are misused as workrooms.  The\n   lodging-houses for proletarians are rather numerous (over four\n   hundred), chiefly in courts in the heart of the town.  They are nearly\n   all disgustingly filthy and ill-smelling, the refuge of beggars,\n   thieves, tramps, and prostitutes, who eat, drink, smoke, and sleep\n   here without the slightest regard to comfort or decency in an\n   atmosphere endurable to these degraded beings only.\"\n\nGlasgow is in many respects similar to Edinburgh, possessing the same\nwynds, the same tall houses.  Of this city the _Artisan_ observes:\n\n   \"The working-class forms here some 78% of the whole population (about\n   300,000), and lives in parts of the city which exceed in wretchedness\n   and squalor the lowest nooks of St. Giles and Whitechapel, the\n   Liberties of Dublin, the Wynds of Edinburgh.  There are numbers of\n   such localities in the heart of the city, south of the Trongate,\n   westward from the Saltmarket, in Calton and off the High Street,\n   endless labyrinths of lanes or wynds into which open at almost every\n   step, courts or blind alleys, formed by ill-ventilated, high-piled,\n   waterless, and dilapidated houses.  These are literally swarming with\n   inhabitants.  They contain three or four families upon each floor,\n   perhaps twenty persons.  In some cases each storey is let out in\n   sleeping places, so that fifteen to twenty persons are packed, one on\n   top of the other, I cannot say accommodated, in a single room.  These\n   districts shelter the poorest, most depraved, and worthless members of\n   the community, and may be regarded as the sources of those frightful\n   epidemics which, beginning here, spread desolation over Glasgow.\"\n\nLet us hear how J. C. Symonds, Government Commissioner for the\ninvestigation of the condition of the hand-weavers, describes these\nportions of the city: {38}\n\n   \"I have seen wretchedness in some of its worse phases both here and\n   upon the Continent, but until I visited the wynds of Glasgow I did not\n   believe that so much crime, misery, and disease could exist in any\n   civilised country.  In the lower lodging-houses ten, twelve, sometimes\n   twenty persons of both sexes, all ages and various degrees of\n   nakedness, sleep indiscriminately huddled together upon the floor.\n   These dwellings are usually so damp, filthy, and ruinous, that no one\n   could wish to keep his horse in one of them.\"\n\nAnd in another place:\n\n   \"The wynds of Glasgow contain a fluctuating population of fifteen to\n   thirty thousand human beings.  This quarter consists wholly of narrow\n   alleys and square courts, in the middle of every one of which there\n   lies a dung heap.  Revolting as was the outward appearance of these\n   courts, I was yet not prepared for the filth and wretchedness within.\n   In some of the sleeping-places which we visited at night (the\n   Superintendent of Police, Captain Miller, and Symonds) we found a\n   complete layer of human beings stretched upon the floor, often fifteen\n   to twenty, some clad, others naked, men and women indiscriminately.\n   Their bed was a litter of mouldy straw, mixed with rags.  There was\n   little or no furniture, and the only thing which gave these dens any\n   shimmer of habitableness was a fire upon the hearth.  Theft and\n   prostitution form the chief means of subsistence of this population.\n   No one seemed to take the trouble to cleanse this Augean stable, this\n   Pandemonium, this tangle of crime, filth, and pestilence in the centre\n   of the second city of the kingdom.  An extended examination of the\n   lowest districts of other cities never revealed anything half so bad,\n   either in intensity of moral and physical infection, nor in\n   comparative density of population.  In this quarter most of the houses\n   have been declared by the Court of Guild ruinous and unfit for\n   habitation, but precisely these are the most densely populated,\n   because, according to the law, no rent can be demanded for them.\"\n\nThe great manufacturing district in the centre of the British Islands,\nthe thickly peopled stretch of West Yorkshire and South Lancashire, with\nits numerous factory towns, yields nothing to the other great\nmanufacturing centres.  The woollen district of the West Riding of\nYorkshire is a charming region, a beautiful green hill country, whose\nelevations grow more rugged towards the West until they reach their\nhighest point in the bold ridge of Blackstone Edge, the watershed between\nthe Irish Sea and the German Ocean.  The valleys of the Aire, along which\nstretches Leeds, and of the Calder, through which the Manchester-Leeds\nrailway runs, are among the most attractive in England, and are strewn in\nall directions with the factories, villages, and towns.  The houses of\nrough grey stone look so neat and clean in comparison with the blackened\nbrick buildings of Lancashire, that it is a pleasure to look at them.  But\non coming into the towns themselves, one finds little to rejoice over.\nLeeds lies as the _Artisan_ describes it, and as I found confirmed upon\nexamination: \"on a gentle slope that descends into the valley of the\nAire.  This stream flows through the city for about a mile-and-a-half and\nis exposed to violent floods during thaws or heavy rain.  The higher\nwestern portions of the city are clean, for such a large town.  But the\nlow-lying districts along the river and its tributary becks are narrow,\ndirty, and enough in themselves to shorten the lives of the inhabitants,\nespecially of little children.  Added to this, the disgusting state of\nthe working-men's districts about Kirkgate, Marsh Lane, Cross Street and\nRichmond Road, which is chiefly attributable to their unpaved, drainless\nstreets, irregular architecture, numerous courts and alleys, and total\nlack of the most ordinary means of cleanliness, all this taken together\nis explanation enough of the excessive mortality in these unhappy abodes\nof filthy misery.  In consequence of the overflows of the Aire\" (which,\nit must be added, like all other rivers in the service of manufacture,\nflows into the city at one end clear and transparent, and flows out at\nthe other end thick, black, and foul, smelling of all possible refuse),\n\"the houses and cellars are often so full of water that they have to be\npumped out.  And at such times the water rises, even where there are\nsewers, out of them into cellars, {40a} engenders miasmatic vapours\nstrongly impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen, and leaves a disgusting\nresiduum highly injurious to health.  During the spring-floods of 1839\nthe action of such a choking of the sewers was so injurious, that,\naccording to the report of the Registrar of Births and Deaths for this\npart of the town, there were three deaths to two births, whereas in the\nsame three months, in every other part of the town, there were three\nbirths to two deaths.  Other thickly populated districts are without any\nsewers whatsoever, or so badly provided as to derive no benefit from\nthem.  In some rows of houses the cellars are seldom dry; in certain\ndistricts there are several streets covered with soft mud a foot deep.\nThe inhabitants have made vain attempts from time to time to repair these\nstreets with shovelfuls of cinders, but in spite of all such attempts,\ndung-heaps, and pools of dirty water emptied from the houses, fill all\nthe holes until wind and sun dry them up. {40b}  An ordinary cottage in\nLeeds occupies not more than five yards square of land, and usually\nconsists of a cellar, a living room, and one sleeping-room.  These\ncontracted dwellings, filled day and night with human beings, are another\npoint dangerous alike to the morals and the health of the inhabitants.\"\nAnd how greatly these cottages are crowded, the Report on the Health of\nthe Working-Classes, quoted above, bears testimony: \"In Leeds we found\nbrothers and sisters, and lodgers of both sexes, sharing the parents'\nsleeping-room, whence arise consequences at the contemplation of which\nhuman feeling shudders.\"\n\nSo, too, Bradford, which, but seven miles from Leeds at the junction of\nseveral valleys, lies upon the banks of a small, coal-black,\nfoul-smelling stream.  On week-days the town is enveloped in a grey cloud\nof coal smoke, but on a fine Sunday it offers a superb picture, when\nviewed from the surrounding heights.  Yet within reigns the same filth\nand discomfort as in Leeds.  The older portions of the town are built\nupon steep hillsides, and are narrow and irregular.  In the lanes,\nalleys, and courts lie filth and _debris_ in heaps; the houses are\nruinous, dirty, and miserable, and in the immediate vicinity of the river\nand the valley bottom I found many a one, whose ground-floor, half-buried\nin the hillside, was totally abandoned.  In general, the portions of the\nvalley bottom in which working-men's cottages have crowded between the\ntall factories, are among the worst built and dirtiest districts of the\nwhole town.  In the newer portions of this, as of every other factory\ntown, the cottages are more regular, being built in rows, but they share\nhere, too, all the evils incident to the customary method of providing\nworking-men's dwellings, evils of which we shall have occasions to speak\nmore particularly in discussing Manchester.  The same is true of the\nremaining towns of the West Riding, especially of Barnsley, Halifax and\nHuddersfield.  The last named, the handsomest by far of all the factory\ntowns of Yorkshire and Lancashire, by reason of its charming situation\nand modern architecture, has yet its bad quarter; for a committee\nappointed by a meeting of citizens to survey the town, reported August\n5th, 1844: \"It is notorious that in Huddersfield whole streets and many\nlanes and courts are neither paved nor supplied with sewers nor other\ndrains; that in them refuse, _debris_, and filth of every sort lies\naccumulating, festers and rots, and that, nearly everywhere, stagnant\nwater accumulates in pools, in consequence of which the adjoining\ndwellings must inevitably be bad and filthy, so that in such places\ndiseases arise and threaten the health of the whole town.\"\n\nIf we cross Blackstone Edge or penetrate it with the railroad, we enter\nupon that classic soil on which English manufacture has achieved its\nmasterwork and from which all labour movements emanate, namely, South\nLancashire with its central city Manchester.  Again we have beautiful\nhill country, sloping gently from the watershed westwards towards the\nIrish Sea, with the charming green valleys of the Ribble, the Irwell, the\nMersey, and their tributaries, a country which, a hundred years ago\nchiefly swamp land, thinly populated, is now sown with towns and\nvillages, and is the most densely populated strip of country in England.\nIn Lancashire, and especially in Manchester, English manufacture finds at\nonce its starting point and its centre.  The Manchester Exchange is the\nthermometer for all the fluctuations of trade.  The modern art of\nmanufacture has reached its perfection in Manchester.  In the cotton\nindustry of South Lancashire, the application of the forces of Nature,\nthe superseding of hand labour by machinery (especially by the power-loom\nand the self-acting mule), and the division of labour, are seen at the\nhighest point; and, if we recognise in these three elements that which is\ncharacteristic of modern manufacture, we must confess that the cotton\nindustry has remained in advance of all other branches of industry from\nthe beginning down to the present day.  The effects of modern manufacture\nupon the working-class must necessarily develop here most freely and\nperfectly, and the manufacturing proletariat present itself in its\nfullest classic perfection.  The degradation to which the application of\nsteam-power, machinery and the division of labour reduce the working-man,\nand the attempts of the proletariat to rise above this abasement, must\nlikewise be carried to the highest point and with the fullest\nconsciousness.  Hence because Manchester is the classic type of a modern\nmanufacturing town, and because I know it as intimately as my own native\ntown, more intimately than most of its residents know it, we shall make a\nlonger stay here.\n\nThe towns surrounding Manchester vary little from the central city, so\nfar as the working-people's quarters are concerned, except that the\nworking-class forms, if possible, a larger proportion of their\npopulation.  These towns are purely industrial and conduct all their\nbusiness through Manchester upon which they are in every respect\ndependent, whence they are inhabited only by working-men and petty\ntradesmen, while Manchester has a very considerable commercial\npopulation, especially of commission and \"respectable\" retail dealers.\nHence Bolton, Preston, Wigan, Bury, Rochdale, Middleton, Heywood, Oldham,\nAshton, Stalybridge, Stockport, etc., though nearly all towns of thirty,\nfifty, seventy to ninety thousand inhabitants, are almost wholly working-\npeople's districts, interspersed only with factories, a few thoroughfares\nlined with shops, and a few lanes along which the gardens and houses of\nthe manufacturers are scattered like villas.  The towns themselves are\nbadly and irregularly built with foul courts, lanes, and back alleys,\nreeking of coal smoke, and especially dingy from the originally bright\nred brick, turned black with time, which is here the universal building\nmaterial.  Cellar dwellings are general here; wherever it is in any way\npossible, these subterranean dens are constructed, and a very\nconsiderable portion of the population dwells in them.\n\nAmong the worst of these towns after Preston and Oldham is Bolton, eleven\nmiles north-west of Manchester.  It has, so far as I have been able to\nobserve in my repeated visits, but one main street, a very dirty one,\nDeansgate, which serves as a market, and is even in the finest weather a\ndark, unattractive hole in spite of the fact that, except for the\nfactories, its sides are formed by low one and two-storied houses.  Here,\nas everywhere, the older part of the town is especially ruinous and\nmiserable.  A dark-coloured body of water, which leaves the beholder in\ndoubt whether it is a brook or a long string of stagnant puddles, flows\nthrough the town and contributes its share to the total pollution of the\nair, by no means pure without it.\n\nThere is Stockport, too, which lies on the Cheshire side of the Mersey,\nbut belongs nevertheless to the manufacturing district of Manchester.  It\nlies in a narrow valley along the Mersey, so that the streets slope down\na steep hill on one side and up an equally steep one on the other, while\nthe railway from Manchester to Birmingham passes over a high viaduct\nabove the city and the whole valley.  Stockport is renowned throughout\nthe entire district as one of the duskiest, smokiest holes, and looks,\nindeed, especially when viewed from the viaduct, excessively repellent.\nBut far more repulsive are the cottages and cellar dwellings of the\nworking-class, which stretch in long rows through all parts of the town\nfrom the valley bottom to the crest of the hill.  I do not remember to\nhave seen so many cellars used as dwellings in any other town of this\ndistrict.\n\nA few miles north-east of Stockport is Ashton-under-Lyne, one of the\nnewest factory towns of this region.  It stands on the slope of a hill at\nthe foot of which are the canal and the river Tame, and is, in general,\nbuilt on the newer, more regular plan.  Five or six parallel streets\nstretch along the hill intersected at right angles by others leading down\ninto the valley.  By this method, the factories would be excluded from\nthe town proper, even if the proximity of the river and the canal-way did\nnot draw them all into the valley where they stand thickly crowded,\nbelching forth black smoke from their chimneys.  To this arrangement\nAshton owes a much more attractive appearance than that of most factory\ntowns; the streets are broad and cleaner, the cottages look new, bright\nred, and comfortable.  But the modern system of building cottages for\nworking-men has its own disadvantages; every street has its concealed\nback lane to which a narrow paved path leads, and which is all the\ndirtier.  And, although I saw no buildings, except a few on entering,\nwhich could have been more than fifty years old, there are even in Ashton\nstreets in which the cottages are getting bad, where the bricks in the\nhouse-corners are no longer firm but shift about, in which the walls have\ncracks and will not hold the chalk whitewash inside; streets, whose\ndirty, smoke-begrimed aspect is nowise different from that of the other\ntowns of the district, except that in Ashton, this is the exception, not\nthe rule.\n\nA mile eastward lies Stalybridge, also on the Tame.  In coming over the\nhill from Ashton, the traveller has, at the top, both right and left,\nfine large gardens with superb villa-like houses in their midst, built\nusually in the Elizabethan style, which is to the Gothic precisely what\nthe Anglican Church is to the Apostolic Roman Catholic.  A hundred paces\nfarther and Stalybridge shows itself in the valley, in sharp contrast\nwith the beautiful country seats, in sharp contrast even with the modest\ncottages of Ashton!  Stalybridge lies in a narrow, crooked ravine, much\nnarrower even than the valley at Stockport, and both sides of this ravine\nare occupied by an irregular group of cottages, houses, and mills.  On\nentering, the very first cottages are narrow, smoke-begrimed, old and\nruinous; and as the first houses, so the whole town.  A few streets lie\nin the narrow valley bottom, most of them run criss-cross, pell-mell, up\nhill and down, and in nearly all the houses, by reason of this sloping\nsituation, the ground floor is half-buried in the earth; and what\nmultitudes of courts, back lanes, and remote nooks arise out of this\nconfused way of building may be seen from the hills, whence one has the\ntown, here and there, in a bird's-eye view almost at one's feet.  Add to\nthis the shocking filth, and the repulsive effect of Stalybridge, in\nspite of its pretty surroundings, may be readily imagined.\n\nBut enough of these little towns.  Each has its own peculiarities, but in\ngeneral, the working-people live in them just as in Manchester.  Hence I\nhave especially sketched only their peculiar construction, and would\nobserve, that all more general observations as to the condition of the\nlabouring population in Manchester are fully applicable to these\nsurrounding towns as well.\n\nManchester lies at the foot of the southern slope of a range of hills,\nwhich stretch hither from Oldham, their last peak, Kersallmoor, being at\nonce the racecourse and the Mons Sacer of Manchester.  Manchester proper\nlies on the left bank of the Irwell, between that stream and the two\nsmaller ones, the Irk and the Medlock, which here empty into the Irwell.\nOn the left bank of the Irwell, bounded by a sharp curve of the river,\nlies Salford, and farther westward Pendleton; northward from the Irwell\nlie Upper and Lower Broughton; northward of the Irk, Cheetham Hill; south\nof the Medlock lies Hulme; farther east Chorlton on Medlock; still\nfarther, pretty well to the east of Manchester, Ardwick.  The whole\nassemblage of buildings is commonly called Manchester, and contains about\nfour hundred thousand inhabitants, rather more than less.  The town\nitself is peculiarly built, so that a person may live in it for years,\nand go in and out daily without coming into contact with a\nworking-people's quarter or even with workers, that is, so long as he\nconfines himself to his business or to pleasure walks.  This arises\nchiefly from the fact, that by unconscious tacit agreement, as well as\nwith outspoken conscious determination, the working-people's quarters are\nsharply separated from the sections of the city reserved for the middle-\nclass; or, if this does not succeed, they are concealed with the cloak of\ncharity.  Manchester contains, at its heart, a rather extended commercial\ndistrict, perhaps half a mile long and about as broad, and consisting\nalmost wholly of offices and warehouses.  Nearly the whole district is\nabandoned by dwellers, and is lonely and deserted at night; only watchmen\nand policemen traverse its narrow lanes with their dark lanterns.  This\ndistrict is cut through by certain main thoroughfares upon which the vast\ntraffic concentrates, and in which the ground level is lined with\nbrilliant shops.  In these streets the upper floors are occupied, here\nand there, and there is a good deal of life upon them until late at\nnight.  With the exception of this commercial district, all Manchester\nproper, all Salford and Hulme, a great part of Pendleton and Chorlton,\ntwo-thirds of Ardwick, and single stretches of Cheetham Hill and\nBroughton are all unmixed working-people's quarters, stretching like a\ngirdle, averaging a mile and a half in breadth, around the commercial\ndistrict.  Outside, beyond this girdle, lives the upper and middle\nbourgeoisie, the middle bourgeoisie in regularly laid out streets in the\nvicinity of the working quarters, especially in Chorlton and the lower\nlying portions of Cheetham Hill; the upper bourgeoisie in remoter villas\nwith gardens in Chorlton and Ardwick, or on the breezy heights of\nCheetham Hill, Broughton, and Pendleton, in free, wholesome country air,\nin fine, comfortable homes, passed once every half or quarter hour by\nomnibuses going into the city.  And the finest part of the arrangement is\nthis, that the members of this money aristocracy can take the shortest\nroad through the middle of all the labouring districts to their places of\nbusiness, without ever seeing that they are in the midst of the grimy\nmisery that lurks to the right and the left.  For the thoroughfares\nleading from the Exchange in all directions out of the city are lined, on\nboth sides, with an almost unbroken series of shops, and are so kept in\nthe hands of the middle and lower bourgeoisie, which, out of\nself-interest, cares for a decent and cleanly external appearance and\n_can_ care for it.  True, these shops bear some relation to the districts\nwhich lie behind them, and are more elegant in the commercial and\nresidential quarters than when they hide grimy working-men's dwellings;\nbut they suffice to conceal from the eyes of the wealthy men and women of\nstrong stomachs and weak nerves the misery and grime which form the\ncomplement of their wealth.  So, for instance, Deansgate, which leads\nfrom the Old Church directly southward, is lined first with mills and\nwarehouses, then with second-rate shops and alehouses; farther south,\nwhen it leaves the commercial district, with less inviting shops, which\ngrow dirtier and more interrupted by beerhouses and gin palaces the\nfarther one goes, until at the southern end the appearance of the shops\nleaves no doubt that workers and workers only are their customers.  So\nMarket Street running south-east from the Exchange; at first brilliant\nshops of the best sort, with counting-houses or warehouses above; in the\ncontinuation, Piccadilly, immense hotels and warehouses; in the farther\ncontinuation, London Road, in the neighbourhood of the Medlock,\nfactories, beerhouses, shops for the humbler bourgeoisie and the working\npopulation; and from this point onward, large gardens and villas of the\nwealthier merchants and manufacturers.  In this way any one who knows\nManchester can infer the adjoining districts, from the appearance of the\nthoroughfare, but one is seldom in a position to catch from the street a\nglimpse of the real labouring districts.  I know very well that this\nhypocritical plan is more or less common to all great cities; I know,\ntoo, that the retail dealers are forced by the nature of their business\nto take possession of the great highways; I know that there are more good\nbuildings than bad ones upon such streets everywhere, and that the value\nof land is greater near them than in remoter districts; but at the same\ntime I have never seen so systematic a shutting out of the working-class\nfrom the thoroughfares, so tender a concealment of everything which might\naffront the eye and the nerves of the bourgeoisie, as in Manchester.  And\nyet, in other respects, Manchester is less built according to a plan,\nafter official regulations, is more an outgrowth of accident, than any\nother city; and when I consider in this connection the eager assurances\nof the middle-class, that the working-class is doing famously, I cannot\nhelp feeling that the liberal manufacturers, the \"Big Wigs\" of\nManchester, are not so innocent after all, in the matter of this\nsensitive method of construction.\n\nI may mention just here that the mills almost all adjoin the rivers or\nthe different canals that ramify throughout the city, before I proceed at\nonce to describe the labouring quarters.  First of all, there is the old\ntown of Manchester, which lies between the northern boundary of the\ncommercial district and the Irk.  Here the streets, even the better ones,\nare narrow and winding, as Todd Street, Long Millgate, Withy Grove, and\nShude Hill, the houses dirty, old, and tumble-down, and the construction\nof the side streets utterly horrible.  Going from the Old Church to Long\nMillgate, the stroller has at once a row of old-fashioned houses at the\nright, of which not one has kept its original level; these are remnants\nof the old pre-manufacturing Manchester, whose former inhabitants have\nremoved with their descendants into better-built districts, and have left\nthe houses, which were not good enough for them, to a population strongly\nmixed with Irish blood.  Here one is in an almost undisguised working-\nmen's quarter, for even the shops and beerhouses hardly take the trouble\nto exhibit a trifling degree of cleanliness.  But all this is nothing in\ncomparison with the courts and lanes which lie behind, to which access\ncan be gained only through covered passages, in which no two human beings\ncan pass at the same time.  Of the irregular cramming together of\ndwellings in ways which defy all rational plan, of the tangle in which\nthey are crowded literally one upon the other, it is impossible to convey\nan idea.  And it is not the buildings surviving from the old times of\nManchester which are to blame for this; the confusion has only recently\nreached its height when every scrap of space left by the old way of\nbuilding has been filled up and patched over until not a foot of land is\nleft to be further occupied.\n\nThe south bank of the Irk is here very steep and between fifteen and\nthirty feet high.  On this declivitous hillside there are planted three\nrows of houses, of which the lowest rise directly out of the river, while\nthe front walls of the highest stand on the crest of the hill in Long\nMillgate.  Among them are mills on the river, in short, the method of\nconstruction is as crowded and disorderly here as in the lower part of\nLong Millgate.  Right and left a multitude of covered passages lead from\nthe main street into numerous courts, and he who turns in thither gets\ninto a filth and disgusting grime, the equal of which is not to be\nfound--especially in the courts which lead down to the Irk, and which\ncontain unqualifiedly the most horrible dwellings which I have yet\nbeheld.  In one of these courts there stands directly at the entrance, at\nthe end of the covered passage, a privy without a door, so dirty that the\ninhabitants can pass into and out of the court only by passing through\nfoul pools of stagnant urine and excrement.  This is the first court on\nthe Irk above Ducie Bridge--in case any one should care to look into it.\nBelow it on the river there are several tanneries which fill the whole\nneighbourhood with the stench of animal putrefaction.  Below Ducie Bridge\nthe only entrance to most of the houses is by means of narrow, dirty\nstairs and over heaps of refuse and filth.  The first court below Ducie\nBridge, known as Allen's Court, was in such a state at the time of the\ncholera that the sanitary police ordered it evacuated, swept, and\ndisinfected with chloride of lime.  Dr. Kay gives a terrible description\nof the state of this court at that time. {49}  Since then, it seems to\nhave been partially torn away and rebuilt; at least looking down from\nDucie Bridge, the passer-by sees several ruined walls and heaps of debris\nwith some newer houses.  The view from this bridge, mercifully concealed\nfrom mortals of small stature by a parapet as high as a man, is\ncharacteristic for the whole district.  At the bottom flows, or rather\nstagnates, the Irk, a narrow, coal-black, foul-smelling stream, full of\ndebris and refuse, which it deposits on the shallower right bank.  In dry\nweather, a long string of the most disgusting, blackish-green, slime\npools are left standing on this bank, from the depths of which bubbles of\nmiasmatic gas constantly arise and give forth a stench unendurable even\non the bridge forty or fifty feet above the surface of the stream.  But\nbesides this, the stream itself is checked every few paces by high weirs,\nbehind which slime and refuse accumulate and rot in thick masses.  Above\nthe bridge are tanneries, bonemills, and gasworks, from which all drains\nand refuse find their way into the Irk, which receives further the\ncontents of all the neighbouring sewers and privies.  It may be easily\nimagined, therefore, what sort of residue the stream deposits.  Below the\nbridge you look upon the piles of debris, the refuse, filth, and offal\nfrom the courts on the steep left bank; here each house is packed close\nbehind its neighbour and a piece of each is visible, all black, smoky,\ncrumbling, ancient, with broken panes and window frames.  The background\nis furnished by old barrack-like factory buildings.  On the lower right\nbank stands a long row of houses and mills; the second house being a ruin\nwithout a roof, piled with debris; the third stands so low that the\nlowest floor is uninhabitable, and therefore without windows or doors.\nHere the background embraces the pauper burial-ground, the station of the\nLiverpool and Leeds railway, and, in the rear of this, the Workhouse, the\n\"Poor-Law Bastille\" of Manchester, which, like a citadel, looks\nthreateningly down from behind its high walls and parapets on the\nhilltop, upon the working-people's quarter below.\n\nAbove Ducie Bridge, the left bank grows more flat and the right bank\nsteeper, but the condition of the dwellings on both banks grows worse\nrather than better.  He who turns to the left here from the main street,\nLong Millgate, is lost; he wanders from one court to another, turns\ncountless corners, passes nothing but narrow, filthy nooks and alleys,\nuntil after a few minutes he has lost all clue, and knows not whither to\nturn.  Everywhere half or wholly ruined buildings, some of them actually\nuninhabited, which means a great deal here; rarely a wooden or stone\nfloor to be seen in the houses, almost uniformly broken, ill-fitting\nwindows and doors, and a state of filth!  Everywhere heaps of debris,\nrefuse, and offal; standing pools for gutters, and a stench which alone\nwould make it impossible for a human being in any degree civilised to\nlive in such a district.  The newly-built extension of the Leeds railway,\nwhich crosses the Irk here, has swept away some of these courts and\nlanes, laying others completely open to view.  Immediately under the\nrailway bridge there stands a court, the filth and horrors of which\nsurpass all the others by far, just because it was hitherto so shut off,\nso secluded that the way to it could not be found without a good deal of\ntrouble.  I should never have discovered it myself, without the breaks\nmade by the railway, though I thought I knew this whole region\nthoroughly.  Passing along a rough bank, among stakes and washing-lines,\none penetrates into this chaos of small one-storied, one-roomed huts, in\nmost of which there is no artificial floor; kitchen, living and sleeping-\nroom all in one.  In such a hole, scarcely five feet long by six broad, I\nfound two beds--and such bedsteads and beds!--which, with a staircase and\nchimney-place, exactly filled the room.  In several others I found\nabsolutely nothing, while the door stood open, and the inhabitants leaned\nagainst it.  Everywhere before the doors refuse and offal; that any sort\nof pavement lay underneath could not be seen but only felt, here and\nthere, with the feet.  This whole collection of cattle-sheds for human\nbeings was surrounded on two sides by houses and a factory, and on the\nthird by the river, and besides the narrow stair up the bank, a narrow\ndoorway alone led out into another almost equally ill-built, ill-kept\nlabyrinth of dwellings.\n\nEnough!  The whole side of the Irk is built in this way, a planless,\nknotted chaos of houses, more or less on the verge of uninhabitableness,\nwhose unclean interiors fully correspond with their filthy external\nsurroundings.  And how could the people be clean with no proper\nopportunity for satisfying the most natural and ordinary wants?  Privies\nare so rare here that they are either filled up every day, or are too\nremote for most of the inhabitants to use.  How can people wash when they\nhave only the dirty Irk water at hand, while pumps and water pipes can be\nfound in decent parts of the city alone?  In truth, it cannot be charged\nto the account of these helots of modern society if their dwellings are\nnot more cleanly than the pig-sties which are here and there to be seen\namong them.  The landlords are not ashamed to let dwellings like the six\nor seven cellars on the quay directly below Scotland Bridge, the floors\nof which stand at least two feet below the low-water level of the Irk\nthat flows not six feet away from them; or like the upper floor of the\ncorner-house on the opposite shore directly above the bridge, where the\nground floor, utterly uninhabitable, stands deprived of all fittings for\ndoors and windows, a case by no means rare in this region, when this open\nground floor is used as a privy by the whole neighbourhood for want of\nother facilities!\n\nIf we leave the Irk and penetrate once more on the opposite side from\nLong Millgate into the midst of the working-men's dwellings, we shall\ncome into a somewhat newer quarter, which stretches from St. Michael's\nChurch to Withy Grove and Shude Hill.  Here there is somewhat better\norder.  In place of the chaos of buildings, we find at least long\nstraight lanes and alleys or courts, built according to a plan and\nusually square.  But if, in the former case, every house was built\naccording to caprice, here each lane and court is so built, without\nreference to the situation of the adjoining ones.  The lanes run now in\nthis direction, now in that, while every two minutes the wanderer gets\ninto a blind alley, or, on turning a corner, finds himself back where he\nstarted from; certainly no one who has not lived a considerable time in\nthis labyrinth can find his way through it.\n\nIf I may use the word at all in speaking of this district, the\nventilation of these streets and courts is, in consequence of this\nconfusion, quite as imperfect as in the Irk region; and if this quarter\nmay, nevertheless, be said to have some advantage over that of the Irk,\nthe houses being newer and the streets occasionally having gutters,\nnearly every house has, on the other hand, a cellar dwelling, which is\nrarely found in the Irk district, by reason of the greater age and more\ncareless construction of the houses.  As for the rest, the filth, debris,\nand offal heaps, and the pools in the streets are common to both\nquarters, and in the district now under discussion, another feature most\ninjurious to the cleanliness of the inhabitants, is the multitude of pigs\nwalking about in all the alleys, rooting into the offal heaps, or kept\nimprisoned in small pens.  Here, as in most of the working-men's quarters\nof Manchester, the pork-raisers rent the courts and build pig-pens in\nthem.  In almost every court one or even several such pens may be found,\ninto which the inhabitants of the court throw all refuse and offal,\nwhence the swine grow fat; and the atmosphere, confined on all four\nsides, is utterly corrupted by putrefying animal and vegetable\nsubstances.  Through this quarter, a broad and measurably decent street\nhas been cut, Millers Street, and the background has been pretty\nsuccessfully concealed.  But if any one should be led by curiosity to\npass through one of the numerous passages which lead into the courts, he\nwill find this piggery repeated at every twenty paces.\n\nSuch is the Old Town of Manchester, and on re-reading my description, I\nam forced to admit that instead of being exaggerated, it is far from\nblack enough to convey a true impression of the filth, ruin, and\nuninhabitableness, the defiance of all considerations of cleanliness,\nventilation, and health which characterise the construction of this\nsingle district, containing at least twenty to thirty thousand\ninhabitants.  And such a district exists in the heart of the second city\nof England, the first manufacturing city of the world.  If any one wishes\nto see in how little space a human being can move, how little air--and\n_such_ air!--he can breathe, how little of civilisation he may share and\nyet live, it is only necessary to travel hither.  True, this is the _Old_\nTown, and the people of Manchester emphasise the fact whenever any one\nmentions to them the frightful condition of this Hell upon Earth; but\nwhat does that prove?  Everything which here arouses horror and\nindignation is of recent origin, belongs to the _industrial epoch_.  The\ncouple of hundred houses, which belong to old Manchester, have been long\nsince abandoned by their original inhabitants; the industrial epoch alone\nhas crammed into them the swarms of workers whom they now shelter; the\nindustrial epoch alone has built up every spot between these old houses\nto win a covering for the masses whom it has conjured hither from the\nagricultural districts and from Ireland; the industrial epoch alone\nenables the owners of these cattle-sheds to rent them for high prices to\nhuman beings, to plunder the poverty of the workers, to undermine the\nhealth of thousands, in order that they _alone_, the owners, may grow\nrich.  In the industrial epoch alone has it become possible that the\nworker scarcely freed from feudal servitude could be used as mere\nmaterial, a mere chattel; that he must let himself be crowded into a\ndwelling too bad for every other, which he for his hard-earned wages buys\nthe right to let go utterly to ruin.  This manufacture has achieved,\nwhich, without these workers, this poverty, this slavery could not have\nlived.  True, the original construction of this quarter was bad, little\ngood could have been made out of it; but, have the landowners, has the\nmunicipality done anything to improve it when rebuilding?  On the\ncontrary, wherever a nook or corner was free, a house has been run up;\nwhere a superfluous passage remained, it has been built up; the value of\nland rose with the blossoming out of manufacture, and the more it rose,\nthe more madly was the work of building up carried on, without reference\nto the health or comfort of the inhabitants, with sole reference to the\nhighest possible profit on the principle that _no hole is so bad but that\nsome poor creature must take it who can pay for nothing better_.  However,\nit is the Old Town, and with this reflection the bourgeoisie is\ncomforted.  Let us see, therefore, how much better it is in the New Town.\n\nThe New Town, known also as Irish Town, stretches up a hill of clay,\nbeyond the Old Town, between the Irk and St. George's Road.  Here all the\nfeatures of a city are lost.  Single rows of houses or groups of streets\nstand, here and there, like little villages on the naked, not even grass-\ngrown clay soil; the houses, or rather cottages, are in bad order, never\nrepaired, filthy, with damp, unclean, cellar dwellings; the lanes are\nneither paved nor supplied with sewers, but harbour numerous colonies of\nswine penned in small sties or yards, or wandering unrestrained through\nthe neighbourhood.  The mud in the streets is so deep that there is never\na chance, except in the dryest weather, of walking without sinking into\nit ankle deep at every step.  In the vicinity of St. George's Road, the\nseparate groups of buildings approach each other more closely, ending in\na continuation of lanes, blind alleys, back lanes and courts, which grow\nmore and more crowded and irregular the nearer they approach the heart of\nthe town.  True, they are here oftener paved or supplied with paved\nsidewalks and gutters; but the filth, the bad order of the houses, and\nespecially of the cellars, remains the same.\n\nIt may not be out of place to make some general observations just here as\nto the customary construction of working-men's quarters in Manchester.  We\nhave seen how in the Old Town pure accident determined the grouping of\nthe houses in general.  Every house is built without reference to any\nother, and the scraps of space between them are called courts for want of\nanother name.  In the somewhat newer portions of the same quarter, and in\nother working-men's quarters, dating from the early days of industrial\nactivity, a somewhat more orderly arrangement may be found.  The space\nbetween two streets is divided into more regular, usually square courts.\n\nThese courts were built in this way from the beginning, and communicate\nwith the streets by means of covered passages.  If the totally planless\nconstruction is injurious to the health of the workers by preventing\nventilation, this method of shutting them up in courts surrounded on all\nsides by buildings is far more so.  The air simply cannot escape; the\nchimneys of the houses are the sole drains for the imprisoned atmosphere\nof the courts, and they serve the purpose only so long as fire is kept\nburning. {55}  Moreover, the houses surrounding such courts are usually\nbuilt back to back, having the rear wall in common; and this alone\nsuffices to prevent any sufficient through ventilation.  And, as the\npolice charged with care of the streets, does not trouble itself about\nthe condition of these courts, as everything quietly lies where it is\nthrown, there is no cause for wonder at the filth and heaps of ashes and\noffal to be found here.  I have been in courts, in Millers Street, at\nleast half a foot below the level of the thoroughfares, and without the\nslightest drainage for the water that accumulates in them in rainy\nweather!  More recently another different method of building was adopted,\nand has now become general.  Working-men's cottages are almost never\nbuilt singly, but always by the dozen or score; a single contractor\nbuilding up one or two streets at a time.  These are then arranged as\nfollows: One front is formed of cottages of the best class, so fortunate\nas to possess a back door and small court, and these command the highest\nrent.  In the rear of these cottages runs a narrow alley, the back\nstreet, built up at both ends, into which either a narrow roadway or a\ncovered passage leads from one side.  The cottages which face this back\nstreet command least rent, and are most neglected.  These have their rear\nwalls in common with the third row of cottages which face a second\nstreet, and command less rent than the first row and more than the\nsecond.\n\nBy this method of construction, comparatively good ventilation can be\nobtained for the first row of cottages, and the third row is no worse off\nthan in the former method.  The middle row, on the other hand, is at\nleast as badly ventilated as the houses in the courts, and the back\nstreet is always in the same filthy, disgusting condition as they.  The\ncontractors prefer this method because it saves them space, and furnishes\nthe means of fleecing better paid workers through the higher rents of the\ncottages in the first and third rows.  These three different forms of\ncottage building are found all over Manchester and throughout Lancashire\nand Yorkshire, often mixed up together, but usually separate enough to\nindicate the relative age of parts of towns.  The third system, that of\nthe back alleys, prevails largely in the great working-men's district\neast of St. George's Road and Ancoats Street, and is the one most often\nfound in the other working-men's quarters of Manchester and its suburbs.\n\nIn the last-mentioned broad district included under the name Ancoats,\nstand the largest mills of Manchester lining the canals, colossal six and\nseven-storied buildings towering with their slender chimneys far above\nthe low cottages of the workers.  The population of the district\nconsists, therefore, chiefly of mill hands, and in the worst streets, of\nhand-weavers.  The streets nearest the heart of the town are the oldest,\nand consequently the worst; they are, however, paved, and supplied with\ndrains.  Among them I include those nearest to and parallel with Oldham\nRoad and Great Ancoats Street.  Farther to the north-east lie many newly-\nbuilt-up streets; here the cottages look neat and cleanly, doors and\nwindows are new and freshly painted, the rooms within newly whitewashed;\nthe streets themselves are better aired, the vacant building lots between\nthem larger and more numerous.  But this can be said of a minority of the\nhouses only, while cellar dwellings are to be found under almost every\ncottage; many streets are unpaved and without sewers; and, worse than\nall, this neat appearance is all pretence, a pretence which vanishes\nwithin the first ten years.  For the construction of the cottages\nindividually is no less to be condemned than the plan of the streets.  All\nsuch cottages look neat and substantial at first; their massive brick\nwalls deceive the eye, and, on passing through a _newly-built_ working-\nmen's street, without remembering the back alleys and the construction of\nthe houses themselves, one is inclined to agree with the assertion of the\nLiberal manufacturers that the working population is nowhere so well\nhoused as in England.  But on closer examination, it becomes evident that\nthe walls of these cottages are as thin as it is possible to make them.\nThe outer walls, those of the cellar, which bear the weight of the ground\nfloor and roof, are one whole brick thick at most, the bricks lying with\ntheir long sides touching; but I have seen many a cottage of the same\nheight, some in process of building, whose outer walls were but one-half\nbrick thick, the bricks lying not sidewise but lengthwise, their narrow\nends touching.  The object of this is to spare material, but there is\nalso another reason for it; namely, the fact that the contractors never\nown the land but lease it, according to the English custom, for twenty,\nthirty, forty, fifty, or ninety-nine years, at the expiration of which\ntime it falls, with everything upon it, back into the possession of the\noriginal holder, who pays nothing in return for improvements upon it.  The\nimprovements are therefore so calculated by the lessee as to be worth as\nlittle as possible at the expiration of the stipulated term.  And as such\ncottages are often built but twenty or thirty years before the expiration\nof the term, it may easily be imagined that the contractors make no\nunnecessary expenditures upon them.  Moreover, these contractors, usually\ncarpenters and builders, or manufacturers, spend little or nothing in\nrepairs, partly to avoid diminishing their rent receipts, and partly in\nview of the approaching surrender of the improvement to the landowner;\nwhile in consequence of commercial crises and the loss of work that\nfollows them, whole streets often stand empty, the cottages falling\nrapidly into ruin and uninhabitableness.  It is calculated in general\nthat working-men's cottages last only forty years on the average.  This\nsounds strangely enough when one sees the beautiful, massive walls of\nnewly-built ones, which seem to give promise of lasting a couple of\ncenturies; but the fact remains that the niggardliness of the original\nexpenditure, the neglect of all repairs, the frequent periods of\nemptiness, the constant change of inhabitants, and the destruction\ncarried on by the dwellers during the final ten years, usually Irish\nfamilies, who do not hesitate to use the wooden portions for\nfire-wood--all this, taken together, accomplishes the complete ruin of\nthe cottages by the end of forty years.  Hence it comes that Ancoats,\nbuilt chiefly since the sudden growth of manufacture, chiefly indeed\nwithin the present century, contains a vast number of ruinous houses,\nmost of them being, in fact, in the last stages of inhabitableness.  I\nwill not dwell upon the amount of capital thus wasted, the small\nadditional expenditure upon the original improvement and upon repairs\nwhich would suffice to keep this whole district clean, decent, and\ninhabitable for years together.  I have to deal here with the state of\nthe houses and their inhabitants, and it must be admitted that no more\ninjurious and demoralising method of housing the workers has yet been\ndiscovered than precisely this.  The working-man is constrained to occupy\nsuch ruinous dwellings because he cannot pay for others, and because\nthere are no others in the vicinity of his mill; perhaps, too, because\nthey belong to the employer, who engages him only on condition of his\ntaking such a cottage.  The calculation with reference to the forty\nyears' duration of the cottage is, of course, not always perfectly\nstrict; for, if the dwellings are in a thickly-built-up portion of the\ntown, and there is a good prospect of finding steady occupants for them,\nwhile the ground rent is high, the contractors do a little something to\nkeep the cottages inhabitable after the expiration of the forty years.\nThey never do anything more, however, than is absolutely unavoidable, and\nthe dwellings so repaired are the worst of all.  Occasionally when an\nepidemic threatens, the otherwise sleepy conscience of the sanitary\npolice is a little stirred, raids are made into the working-men's\ndistricts, whole rows of cellars and cottages are closed, as happened in\nthe case of several lanes near Oldham Road; but this does not last long:\nthe condemned cottages soon find occupants again, the owners are much\nbetter off by letting them, and the sanitary police won't come again so\nsoon.  These east and north-east sides of Manchester are the only ones on\nwhich the bourgeoisie has not built, because ten or eleven months of the\nyear the west and south-west wind drives the smoke of all the factories\nhither, and that the working-people alone may breathe.\n\nSouthward from Great Ancoats Street, lies a great, straggling, working-\nmen's quarter, a hilly, barren stretch of land, occupied by detached,\nirregularly built rows of houses or squares, between these, empty\nbuilding lots, uneven, clayey, without grass and scarcely passable in wet\nweather.  The cottages are all filthy and old, and recall the New Town to\nmind.  The stretch cut through by the Birmingham railway is the most\nthickly built-up and the worst.  Here flows the Medlock with countless\nwindings through a valley, which is, in places, on a level with the\nvalley of the Irk.  Along both sides of the stream, which is coal black,\nstagnant and foul, stretches a broad belt of factories and working-men's\ndwellings, the latter all in the worst condition.  The bank is chiefly\ndeclivitous and is built over to the water's edge, just as we saw along\nthe Irk; while the houses are equally bad, whether built on the\nManchester side or in Ardwick, Chorlton, or Hulme.  But the most horrible\nspot (if I should describe all the separate spots in detail I should\nnever come to the end) lies on the Manchester side, immediately south-\nwest of Oxford Road, and is known as Little Ireland.  In a rather deep\nhole, in a curve of the Medlock and surrounded on all four sides by tall\nfactories and high embankments, covered with buildings, stand two groups\nof about two hundred cottages, built chiefly back to back, in which live\nabout four thousand human beings, most of them Irish.  The cottages are\nold, dirty, and of the smallest sort, the streets uneven, fallen into\nruts and in part without drains or pavement; masses of refuse, offal and\nsickening filth lie among standing pools in all directions; the\natmosphere is poisoned by the effluvia from these, and laden and darkened\nby the smoke of a dozen tall factory chimneys.  A horde of ragged women\nand children swarm about here, as filthy as the swine that thrive upon\nthe garbage heaps and in the puddles.  In short, the whole rookery\nfurnishes such a hateful and repulsive spectacle as can hardly be\nequalled in the worst court on the Irk.  The race that lives in these\nruinous cottages, behind broken windows, mended with oilskin, sprung\ndoors, and rotten door-posts, or in dark, wet cellars, in measureless\nfilth and stench, in this atmosphere penned in as if with a purpose, this\nrace must really have reached the lowest stage of humanity.  This is the\nimpression and the line of thought which the exterior of this district\nforces upon the beholder.  But what must one think when he hears that in\neach of these pens, containing at most two rooms, a garret and perhaps a\ncellar, on the average twenty human beings live; that in the whole\nregion, for each one hundred and twenty persons, one usually inaccessible\nprivy is provided; and that in spite of all the preachings of the\nphysicians, in spite of the excitement into which the cholera epidemic\nplunged the sanitary police by reason of the condition of Little Ireland,\nin spite of everything, in this year of grace 1844, it is in almost the\nsame state as in 1831!  Dr. Kay asserts that not only the cellars but the\nfirst floors of all the houses in this district are damp; that a number\nof cellars once filled up with earth have now been emptied and are\noccupied once more by Irish people; that in one cellar the water\nconstantly wells up through a hole stopped with clay, the cellar lying\nbelow the river level, so that its occupant, a hand-loom weaver, had to\nbale out the water from his dwelling every morning and pour it into the\nstreet!\n\nFarther down, on the left side of the Medlock, lies Hulme, which,\nproperly speaking, is one great working-people's district, the condition\nof which coincides almost exactly with that of Ancoats; the more thickly\nbuilt-up regions chiefly bad and approaching ruin, the less populous of\nmore modern structure, but generally sunk in filth.  On the other side of\nthe Medlock, in Manchester proper, lies a second great working-men's\ndistrict which stretches on both sides of Deansgate as far as the\nbusiness quarter, and in certain parts rivals the Old Town.  Especially\nin the immediate vicinity of the business quarter, between Bridge and\nQuay Streets, Princess and Peter Streets, the crowded construction\nexceeds in places the narrowest courts of the Old Town.  Here are long,\nnarrow lanes between which run contracted, crooked courts and passages,\nthe entrances to which are so irregular that the explorer is caught in a\nblind alley at every few steps, or comes out where he least expects to,\nunless he knows every court and every alley exactly and separately.\nAccording to Dr. Kay, the most demoralised class of all Manchester lived\nin these ruinous and filthy districts, people whose occupations are\nthieving and prostitution; and, to all appearance, his assertion is still\ntrue at the present moment.  When the sanitary police made its expedition\nhither in 1831, it found the uncleanness as great as in Little Ireland or\nalong the Irk (that it is not much better to-day, I can testify); and\namong other items, they found in Parliament Street for three hundred and\neighty persons, and in Parliament Passage for thirty thickly populated\nhouses, but a single privy.\n\nIf we cross the Irwell to Salford, we find on a peninsula formed by the\nriver, a town of eighty thousand inhabitants, which, properly speaking,\nis one large working-men's quarter, penetrated by a single wide avenue.\nSalford, once more important than Manchester, was then the leading town\nof the surrounding district to which it still gives its name, Salford\nHundred.  Hence it is that an old and therefore very unwholesome, dirty,\nand ruinous locality is to be found here, lying opposite the Old Church\nof Manchester, and in as bad a condition as the Old Town on the other\nside of the Irwell.  Farther away from the river lies the newer portion,\nwhich is, however, already beyond the limit of its forty years of cottage\nlife, and therefore ruinous enough.  All Salford is built in courts or\nnarrow lanes, so narrow, that they remind me of the narrowest I have ever\nseen, the little lanes of Genoa.  The average construction of Salford is\nin this respect much worse than that of Manchester, and so, too, in\nrespect to cleanliness.  If, in Manchester, the police, from time to\ntime, every six or ten years, makes a raid upon the working-people's\ndistricts, closes the worst dwellings, and causes the filthiest spots in\nthese Augean stables to be cleansed, in Salford it seems to have done\nabsolutely nothing.  The narrow side lanes and courts of Chapel Street,\nGreengate, and Gravel Lane have certainly never been cleansed since they\nwere built.  Of late, the Liverpool railway has been carried through the\nmiddle of them, over a high viaduct, and has abolished many of the\nfilthiest nooks; but what does that avail?  Whoever passes over this\nviaduct and looks down, sees filth and wretchedness enough; and, if any\none takes the trouble to pass through these lanes, and glance through the\nopen doors and windows into the houses and cellars, he can convince\nhimself afresh with every step that the workers of Salford live in\ndwellings in which cleanliness and comfort are impossible.  Exactly the\nsame state of affairs is found in the more distant regions of Salford, in\nIslington, along Regent Road, and back of the Bolton railway.  The\nworking-men's dwellings between Oldfield Road and Cross Lane, where a\nmass of courts and alleys are to be found in the worst possible state,\nvie with the dwellings of the Old Town in filth and overcrowding.  In\nthis district I found a man, apparently about sixty years old, living in\na cow stable.  He had constructed a sort of chimney for his square pen,\nwhich had neither windows, floor, nor ceiling, had obtained a bedstead\nand lived there, though the rain dripped through his rotten roof.  This\nman was too old and weak for regular work, and supported himself by\nremoving manure with a hand-cart; the dung-heaps lay next door to his\npalace!\n\nSuch are the various working-people's quarters of Manchester as I had\noccasion to observe them personally during twenty months.  If we briefly\nformulate the result of our wanderings, we must admit that 350,000\nworking-people of Manchester and its environs live, almost all of them,\nin wretched, damp, filthy cottages, that the streets which surround them\nare usually in the most miserable and filthy condition, laid out without\nthe slightest reference to ventilation, with reference solely to the\nprofit secured by the contractor.  In a word, we must confess that in the\nworking-men's dwellings of Manchester, no cleanliness, no convenience,\nand consequently no comfortable family life is possible; that in such\ndwellings only a physically degenerate race, robbed of all humanity,\ndegraded, reduced morally and physically to bestiality, could feel\ncomfortable and at home.  And I am not alone in making this assertion.  We\nhave seen that Dr. Kay gives precisely the same description; and, though\nit is superfluous, I quote further the words of a Liberal, {63}\nrecognised and highly valued as an authority by the manufacturers, and a\nfanatical opponent of all independent movements of the workers:\n\n\"As I passed through the dwellings of the mill hands in Irish Town,\nAncoats, and Little Ireland, I was only amazed that it is possible to\nmaintain a reasonable state of health in such homes.  These towns, for in\nextent and number of inhabitants they are towns, have been erected with\nthe utmost disregard of everything except the immediate advantage of the\nspeculating builder.  A carpenter and builder unite to buy a series of\nbuilding sites (_i.e_., they lease them for a number of years), and cover\nthem with so-called houses.  In one place we found a whole street\nfollowing the course of a ditch, because in this way deeper cellars could\nbe secured without the cost of digging, cellars not for storing wares or\nrubbish, but for dwellings for human beings.  _Not one house of this\nstreet escaped the cholera_.  In general, the streets of these suburbs\nare unpaved, with a dung-heap or ditch in the middle; the houses are\nbuilt back to back, without ventilation or drainage, and whole families\nare limited to a corner of a cellar or a garret.\"  I have already\nreferred to the unusual activity which the sanitary police manifested\nduring the cholera visitation.  When the epidemic was approaching, a\nuniversal terror seized the bourgeoisie of the city.  People remembered\nthe unwholesome dwellings of the poor, and trembled before the certainty\nthat each of these slums would become a centre for the plague, whence it\nwould spread desolation in all directions through the houses of the\npropertied class.  A Health Commission was appointed at once to\ninvestigate these districts, and report upon their condition to the Town\nCouncil.  Dr. Kay, himself a member of this Commission, who visited in\nperson every separate police district except one, the eleventh, quotes\nextracts from their reports: There were inspected, in all, 6,951\nhouses--naturally in Manchester proper alone, Salford and the other\nsuburbs being excluded.  Of these, 6,565 urgently needed whitewashing\nwithin; 960 were out of repair; 939 had insufficient drains; 1,435 were\ndamp; 452 were badly ventilated; 2,221 were without privies.  Of the 687\nstreets inspected, 248 were unpaved, 53 but partially paved, 112\nill-ventilated, 352 containing standing pools, heaps of debris, refuse,\netc.  To cleanse such an Augean stable before the arrival of the cholera\nwas, of course, out of the question.  A few of the worst nooks were\ntherefore cleansed, and everything else left as before.  In the cleansed\nspots, as Little Ireland proves, the old filthy condition was naturally\nrestored in a couple of months.  As to the internal condition of these\nhouses, the same Commission reports a state of things similar to that\nwhich we have already met with in London, Edinburgh, and other cities.\n{64}\n\nIt often happens that a whole Irish family is crowded into one bed; often\na heap of filthy straw or quilts of old sacking cover all in an\nindiscriminate heap, where all alike are degraded by want, stolidity, and\nwretchedness.  Often the inspectors found, in a single house, two\nfamilies in two rooms.  All slept in one, and used the other as a kitchen\nand dining-room in common.  Often more than one family lived in a single\ndamp cellar, in whose pestilent atmosphere twelve to sixteen persons were\ncrowded together.  To these and other sources of disease must be added\nthat pigs were kept, and other disgusting things of the most revolting\nkind were found.\n\nWe must add that many families, who had but one room for themselves,\nreceive boarders and lodgers in it, that such lodgers of both sexes by no\nmeans rarely sleep in the same bed with the married couple; and that the\nsingle case of a man and his wife and his adult sister-in-law sleeping in\none bed was found, according to the \"Report concerning the sanitary\ncondition of the working-class,\" six times repeated in Manchester.  Common\nlodging-houses, too, are very numerous; Dr. Kay gives their number in\n1831 at 267 in Manchester proper, and they must have increased greatly\nsince then.  Each of these receives from twenty to thirty guests, so that\nthey shelter all told, nightly, from five to seven thousand human beings.\nThe character of the houses and their guests is the same as in other\ncities.  Five to seven beds in each room lie on the floor--without\nbedsteads, and on these sleep, mixed indiscriminately, as many persons as\napply.  What physical and moral atmosphere reigns in these holes I need\nnot state.  Each of these houses is a focus of crime, the scene of deeds\nagainst which human nature revolts, which would perhaps never have been\nexecuted but for this forced centralisation of vice. {65}  Gaskell gives\nthe number of persons living in cellars in Manchester proper as 20,000.\nThe _Weekly Dispatch_ gives the number, \"according to official reports,\"\nas twelve per cent. of the working-class, which agrees with Gaskell's\nnumber; the workers being estimated at 175,000, 21,000 would form twelve\nper cent. of it.  The cellar dwellings in the suburbs are at least as\nnumerous, so that the number of persons living in cellars in\nManchester--using its name in the broader sense--is not less than forty\nto fifty thousand.  So much for the dwellings of the workers in the\nlargest cities and towns.  The manner in which the need of a shelter is\nsatisfied furnishes a standard for the manner in which all other\nnecessities are supplied.  That in these filthy holes a ragged, ill-fed\npopulation alone can dwell is a safe conclusion, and such is the fact.\nThe clothing of the working-people, in the majority of cases, is in a\nvery bad condition.  The material used for it is not of the best adapted.\nWool and linen have almost vanished from the wardrobe of both sexes, and\ncotton has taken their place.  Shirts are made of bleached or coloured\ncotton goods; the dresses of the women are chiefly of cotton print goods,\nand woollen petticoats are rarely to be seen on the washline.  The men\nwear chiefly trousers of fustian or other heavy cotton goods, and jackets\nor coats of the same.  Fustian has become the proverbial costume of the\nworking-men, who are called \"fustian jackets,\" and call themselves so in\ncontrast to the gentlemen who wear broadcloth, which latter words are\nused as characteristic for the middle-class.  When Feargus O'Connor, the\nChartist leader, came to Manchester during the insurrection of 1842, he\nappeared, amidst the deafening applause of the working-men, in a fustian\nsuit of clothing.  Hats are the universal head-covering in England, even\nfor working-men, hats of the most diverse forms, round, high,\nbroad-brimmed, narrow-brimmed, or without brims--only the younger men in\nfactory towns wearing caps.  Any one who does not own a hat folds himself\na low, square paper cap.\n\nThe whole clothing of the working-class, even assuming it to be in good\ncondition, is little adapted to the climate.  The damp air of England,\nwith its sudden changes of temperature, more calculated than any other to\ngive rise to colds, obliges almost the whole middle-class to wear flannel\nnext the skin, about the body, and flannel scarfs and shirts are in\nalmost universal use.  Not only is the working-class deprived of this\nprecaution, it is scarcely ever in a position to use a thread of woollen\nclothing; and the heavy cotton goods, though thicker, stiffer, and\nheavier than woollen clothes, afford much less protection against cold\nand wet, remain damp much longer because of their thickness and the\nnature of the stuff, and have nothing of the compact density of fulled\nwoollen cloths.  And, if a working-man once buys himself a woollen coat\nfor Sunday, he must get it from one of the cheap shops where he finds\nbad, so-called \"Devil's-dust\" cloth, manufactured for sale and not for\nuse, and liable to tear or grow threadbare in a fortnight, or he must buy\nof an old clothes'-dealer a half-worn coat which has seen its best days,\nand lasts but a few weeks.  Moreover, the working-man's clothing is, in\nmost cases, in bad condition, and there is the oft-recurring necessity\nfor placing the best pieces in the pawnbroker's shop.  But among very\nlarge numbers, especially among the Irish, the prevailing clothing\nconsists of perfect rags often beyond all mending, or so patched that the\noriginal colour can no longer be detected.  Yet the English and Anglo-\nIrish go on patching, and have carried this art to a remarkable pitch,\nputting wool or bagging on fustian, or the reverse--it's all the same to\nthem.  But the true, transplanted Irish hardly ever patch except in the\nextremest necessity, when the garment would otherwise fall apart.\nOrdinarily the rags of the shirt protrude through the rents in the coat\nor trousers.  They wear, as Thomas Carlyle says,--{67}\n\n   \"A suit of tatters, the getting on or off which is said to be a\n   difficult operation, transacted only in festivals and the high tides\n   of the calendar.\"\n\nThe Irish have introduced, too, the custom previously unknown in England,\nof going barefoot.  In every manufacturing town there is now to be seen a\nmultitude of people, especially women and children, going about barefoot,\nand their example is gradually being adopted by the poorer English.\n\nAs with clothing, so with food.  The workers get what is too bad for the\nproperty-holding class.  In the great towns of England everything may be\nhad of the best, but it costs money; and the workman, who must keep house\non a couple of pence, cannot afford much expense.  Moreover, he usually\nreceives his wages on Saturday evening, for, although a beginning has\nbeen made in the payment of wages on Friday, this excellent arrangement\nis by no means universal; and so he comes to market at five or even seven\no'clock, while the buyers of the middle-class have had the first choice\nduring the morning, when the market teems with the best of everything.\nBut when the workers reach it, the best has vanished, and, if it was\nstill there, they would probably not be able to buy it.  The potatoes\nwhich the workers buy are usually poor, the vegetables wilted, the cheese\nold and of poor quality, the bacon rancid, the meat lean, tough, taken\nfrom old, often diseased, cattle, or such as have died a natural death,\nand not fresh even then, often half decayed.  The sellers are usually\nsmall hucksters who buy up inferior goods, and can sell them cheaply by\nreason of their badness.  The poorest workers are forced to use still\nanother device to get together the things they need with their few pence.\nAs nothing can be sold on Sunday, and all shops must be closed at twelve\no'clock on Saturday night, such things as would not keep until Monday are\nsold at any price between ten o'clock and midnight.  But nine-tenths of\nwhat is sold at ten o'clock is past using by Sunday morning, yet these\nare precisely the provisions which make up the Sunday dinner of the\npoorest class.  The meat which the workers buy is very often past using;\nbut having bought it, they must eat it.  On the 6th of January, 1844 (if\nI am not greatly mistaken), a court leet was held in Manchester, when\neleven meat-sellers were fined for having sold tainted meat.  Each of\nthem had a whole ox or pig, or several sheep, or from fifty to sixty\npounds of meat, which were all confiscated in a tainted condition.  In\none case, sixty-four stuffed Christmas geese were seized which had proved\nunsaleable in Liverpool, and had been forwarded to Manchester, where they\nwere brought to market foul and rotten.  All the particulars, with names\nand fines, were published at the time in the _Manchester Guardian_.  In\nthe six weeks, from July 1st to August 14th, the same sheet reported\nthree similar cases.  According to the _Guardian_ for August 3rd, a pig,\nweighing 200 pounds, which had been found dead and decayed, was cut up\nand exposed for sale by a butcher at Heywood, and was then seized.\nAccording to the number for July 31st, two butchers at Wigan, of whom one\nhad previously been convicted of the same offence, were fined 2 and 4\npounds respectively, for exposing tainted meat for sale; and, according\nto the number for August 10th, twenty-six tainted hams seized at a\ndealer's in Bolton, were publicly burnt, and the dealer fined twenty\nshillings.  But these are by no means all the cases; they do not even\nform a fair average for a period of six weeks, according to which to form\nan average for the year.  There are often seasons in which every number\nof the semi-weekly _Guardian_ mentions a similar case found in Manchester\nor its vicinity.  And when one reflects upon the many cases which must\nescape detection in the extensive markets that stretch along the front of\nevery main street, under the slender supervision of the market\ninspectors--and how else can one explain the boldness with which whole\nanimals are exposed for sale?--when one considers how great the\ntemptation must be, in view of the incomprehensibly small fines mentioned\nin the foregoing cases; when one reflects what condition a piece of meat\nmust have reached to be seized by the inspectors, it is impossible to\nbelieve that the workers obtain good and nourishing meat as a usual\nthing.  But they are victimised in yet another way by the money-greed of\nthe middle-class.  Dealers and manufacturers adulterate all kinds of\nprovisions in an atrocious manner, and without the slightest regard to\nthe health of the consumers.  We have heard the _Manchester Guardian_\nupon this subject, let us hear another organ of the middle-class--I\ndelight in the testimony of my opponents--let us hear the _Liverpool\nMercury_: \"Salted butter is sold for fresh, the lumps being covered with\na coating of fresh butter, or a pound of fresh being laid on top to\ntaste, while the salted article is sold after this test, or the whole\nmass is washed and then sold as fresh.  With sugar, pounded rice and\nother cheap adulterating materials are mixed, and the whole sold at full\nprice.  The refuse of soap-boiling establishments also is mixed with\nother things and sold as sugar.  Chicory and other cheap stuff is mixed\nwith ground coffee, and artificial coffee beans with the unground\narticle.  Cocoa is often adulterated with fine brown earth, treated with\nfat to render it more easily mistakable for real cocoa.  Tea is mixed\nwith the leaves of the sloe and with other refuse, or dry tea-leaves are\nroasted on hot copper plates, so returning to the proper colour and being\nsold as fresh.  Pepper is mixed with pounded nutshells; port wine is\nmanufactured outright (out of alcohol, dye-stuffs, etc.), while it is\nnotorious that more of it is consumed in England alone than is grown in\nPortugal; and tobacco is mixed with disgusting substances of all sorts\nand in all possible forms in which the article is produced.\"  I can add\nthat several of the most respected tobacco dealers in Manchester\nannounced publicly last summer, that, by reason of the universal\nadulteration of tobacco, no firm could carry on business without\nadulteration, and that no cigar costing less than threepence is made\nwholly from tobacco.  These frauds are naturally not restricted to\narticles of food, though I could mention a dozen more, the villainy of\nmixing gypsum or chalk with flour among them.  Fraud is practiced in the\nsale of articles of every sort: flannel, stockings, etc., are stretched,\nand shrink after the first washing; narrow cloth is sold as being from\none and a half to three inches broader than it actually is; stoneware is\nso thinly glazed that the glazing is good for nothing, and cracks at\nonce, and a hundred other rascalities, _tout comme chez nous_.  But the\nlion's share of the evil results of these frauds falls to the workers.\nThe rich are less deceived, because they can pay the high prices of the\nlarge shops which have a reputation to lose, and would injure themselves\nmore than their customers if they kept poor or adulterated wares; the\nrich are spoiled, too, by habitual good eating, and detect adulteration\nmore easily with their sensitive palates.  But the poor, the\nworking-people, to whom a couple of farthings are important, who must buy\nmany things with little money, who cannot afford to inquire too closely\ninto the quality of their purchases, and cannot do so in any case because\nthey have had no opportunity of cultivating their taste--to their share\nfall all the adulterated, poisoned provisions.  They must deal with the\nsmall retailers, must buy perhaps on credit, and these small retail\ndealers who cannot sell even the same quality of goods so cheaply as the\nlargest retailers, because of their small capital and the large\nproportional expenses of their business, must knowingly or unknowingly\nbuy adulterated goods in order to sell at the lower prices required, and\nto meet the competition of the others.  Further, a large retail dealer\nwho has extensive capital invested in his business is ruined with his\nruined credit if detected in a fraudulent practice; but what harm does it\ndo a small grocer, who has customers in a single street only, if frauds\nare proved against him?  If no one trusts him in Ancoats, he moves to\nChorlton or Hulme, where no one knows him, and where he continues to\ndefraud as before; while legal penalties attach to very few adulterations\nunless they involve revenue frauds.  Not in the quality alone, but in the\nquantity of his goods as well, is the English working-man defrauded.  The\nsmall dealers usually have false weights and measures, and an incredible\nnumber of convictions for such offences may be read in the police\nreports.  How universal this form of fraud is in the manufacturing\ndistricts, a couple of extracts from the _Manchester Guardian_ may serve\nto show.  They cover only a short period, and, even here, I have not all\nthe numbers at hand:\n\n_Guardian_, June 16, 1844, Rochdale Sessions.--Four dealers fined five to\nten shillings for using light weights.  Stockport Sessions.--Two dealers\nfined one shilling, one of them having seven light weights and a false\nscale, and both having been warned.\n\n_Guardian_, June 19, Rochdale Sessions.--One dealer fined five, and two\nfarmers ten shillings.\n\n_Guardian_, June 22, Manchester Justices of the Peace.--Nineteen dealers\nfined two shillings and sixpence to two pounds.\n\n_Guardian_, June 26, Ashton Sessions.--Fourteen dealers and farmers fined\ntwo shillings and sixpence to one pound.  Hyde Petty Sessions.--Nine\nfarmers and dealers condemned to pay costs and five shillings fines.\n\n_Guardian_, July 9, Manchester--Sixteen dealers condemned to pay costs\nand fines not exceeding ten shillings.\n\n_Guardian_, July 13, Manchester.--Nine dealers fined from two shillings\nand sixpence to twenty shillings.\n\n_Guardian_, July 24, Rochdale.--Four dealers fined ten to twenty\nshillings.\n\n_Guardian_, July 27, Bolton.--Twelve dealers and innkeepers condemned to\npay costs.\n\n_Guardian_, August 3, Bolton.--Three dealers fined two shillings and\nsixpence, and five shillings.\n\n_Guardian_, August 10, Bolton.--One dealer fined five shillings.\n\nAnd the same causes which make the working-class the chief sufferers from\nfrauds in the quality of goods make them the usual victims of frauds in\nthe question of quantity too.\n\nThe habitual food of the individual working-man naturally varies\naccording to his wages.  The better paid workers, especially those in\nwhose families every member is able to earn something, have good food as\nlong as this state of things lasts; meat daily, and bacon and cheese for\nsupper.  Where wages are less, meat is used only two or three times a\nweek, and the proportion of bread and potatoes increases.  Descending\ngradually, we find the animal food reduced to a small piece of bacon cut\nup with the potatoes; lower still, even this disappears, and there remain\nonly bread, cheese, porridge, and potatoes, until on the lowest round of\nthe ladder, among the Irish, potatoes form the sole food.  As an\naccompaniment, weak tea, with perhaps a little sugar, milk, or spirits,\nis universally drunk.  Tea is regarded in England, and even in Ireland,\nas quite as indispensable as coffee in Germany, and where no tea is used,\nthe bitterest poverty reigns.  But all this pre-supposes that the workman\nhas work.  When he has none, he is wholly at the mercy of accident, and\neats what is given him, what he can beg or steal.  And, if he gets\nnothing, he simply starves, as we have seen.  The quantity of food\nvaries, of course, like its quality, according to the rate of wages, so\nthat among ill-paid workers, even if they have no large families, hunger\nprevails in spite of full and regular work; and the number of the ill-\npaid is very large.  Especially in London, where the competition of the\nworkers rises with the increase of population, this class is very\nnumerous, but it is to be found in other towns as well.  In these cases\nall sorts of devices are used; potato parings, vegetable refuse, and\nrotten vegetables are eaten for want of other food, and everything\ngreedily gathered up which may possibly contain an atom of nourishment.\nAnd, if the week's wages are used up before the end of the week, it often\nenough happens that in the closing days the family gets only as much\nfood, if any, as is barely sufficient to keep off starvation.  Of course\nsuch a way of living unavoidably engenders a multitude of diseases, and\nwhen these appear, when the father from whose work the family is chiefly\nsupported, whose physical exertion most demands nourishment, and who\ntherefore first succumbs--when the father is utterly disabled, then\nmisery reaches its height, and then the brutality with which society\nabandons its members, just when their need is greatest, comes out fully\ninto the light of day.\n\nTo sum up briefly the facts thus far cited.  The great towns are chiefly\ninhabited by working-people, since in the best case there is one\nbourgeois for two workers, often for three, here and there for four;\nthese workers have no property whatsoever of their own, and live wholly\nupon wages, which usually go from hand to mouth.  Society, composed\nwholly of atoms, does not trouble itself about them; leaves them to care\nfor themselves and their families, yet supplies them no means of doing\nthis in an efficient and permanent manner.  Every working-man, even the\nbest, is therefore constantly exposed to loss of work and food, that is\nto death by starvation, and many perish in this way.  The dwellings of\nthe workers are everywhere badly planned, badly built, and kept in the\nworst condition, badly ventilated, damp, and unwholesome.  The\ninhabitants are confined to the smallest possible space, and at least one\nfamily usually sleeps in each room.  The interior arrangement of the\ndwellings is poverty-stricken in various degrees, down to the utter\nabsence of even the most necessary furniture.  The clothing of the\nworkers, too, is generally scanty, and that of great multitudes is in\nrags.  The food is, in general, bad; often almost unfit for use, and in\nmany cases, at least at times, insufficient in quantity, so that, in\nextreme cases, death by starvation results.  Thus the working-class of\nthe great cities offers a graduated scale of conditions in life, in the\nbest cases a temporarily endurable existence for hard work and good\nwages, good and endurable, that is, from the worker's standpoint; in the\nworst cases, bitter want, reaching even homelessness and death by\nstarvation.  The average is much nearer the worst case than the best.  And\nthis series does not fall into fixed classes, so that one can say, this\nfraction of the working-class is well off, has always been so, and\nremains so.  If that is the case here and there, if single branches of\nwork have in general an advantage over others, yet the condition of the\nworkers in each branch is subject to such great fluctuations that a\nsingle working-man may be so placed as to pass through the whole range\nfrom comparative comfort to the extremest need, even to death by\nstarvation, while almost every English working-man can tell a tale of\nmarked changes of fortune.  Let us examine the causes of this somewhat\nmore closely.\n\n\n\n\nCOMPETITION.\n\n\nWe have seen in the introduction how competition created the proletariat\nat the very beginning of the industrial movement, by increasing the wages\nof weavers in consequence of the increased demand for woven goods, so\ninducing the weaving peasants to abandon their farms and earn more money\nby devoting themselves to their looms.  We have seen how it crowded out\nthe small farmers by means of the large farm system, reduced them to the\nrank of proletarians, and attracted them in part into the towns; how it\nfurther ruined the small bourgeoisie in great measure and reduced its\nmembers also to the ranks of the proletariat; how it centralised capital\nin the hands of the few, and population in the great towns.  Such are the\nvarious ways and means by which competition, as it reached its full\nmanifestation and free development in modern industry, created and\nextended the proletariat.  We shall now have to observe its influence on\nthe working-class already created.  And here we must begin by tracing the\nresults of competition of single workers with one another.\n\nCompetition is the completest expression of the battle of all against all\nwhich rules in modern civil society.  This battle, a battle for life, for\nexistence, for everything, in case of need a battle of life and death, is\nfought not between the different classes of society only, but also\nbetween the individual members of these classes.  Each is in the way of\nthe other, and each seeks to crowd out all who are in his way, and to put\nhimself in their place.  The workers are in constant competition among\nthemselves as the members of the bourgeoisie among themselves.  The power-\nloom weaver is in competition with the hand-loom weaver, the unemployed\nor ill-paid hand-loom weaver with him who has work or is better paid,\neach trying to supplant the other.  But this competition of the workers\namong themselves is the worst side of the present state of things in its\neffect upon the worker, the sharpest weapon against the proletariat in\nthe hands of the bourgeoisie.  Hence the effort of the workers to nullify\nthis competition by associations, hence the hatred of the bourgeoisie\ntowards these associations, and its triumph in every defeat which befalls\nthem.\n\nThe proletarian is helpless; left to himself, he cannot live a single\nday.  The bourgeoisie has gained a monopoly of all means of existence in\nthe broadest sense of the word.  What the proletarian needs, he can\nobtain only from this bourgeoisie, which is protected in its monopoly by\nthe power of the State.  The proletarian is, therefore, in law and in\nfact, the slave of the bourgeoisie, which can decree his life or death.\nIt offers him the means of living, but only for an \"equivalent\" for his\nwork.  It even lets him have the appearance of acting from a free choice,\nof making a contract with free, unconstrained consent, as a responsible\nagent who has attained his majority.\n\nFine freedom, where the proletarian has no other choice than that of\neither accepting the conditions which the bourgeoisie offers him, or of\nstarving, of freezing to death, of sleeping naked among the beasts of the\nforests!  A fine \"equivalent\" valued at pleasure by the bourgeoisie!  And\nif one proletarian is such a fool as to starve rather than agree to the\nequitable propositions of the bourgeoisie, his \"natural superiors,\"\nanother is easily found in his place; there are proletarians enough in\nthe world, and not all so insane as to prefer dying to living.\n\nHere we have the competition of the workers among themselves.  If _all_\nthe proletarians announced their determination to starve rather than work\nfor the bourgeoisie, the latter would have to surrender its monopoly.  But\nthis is not the case--is, indeed, a rather impossible case--so that the\nbourgeoisie still thrives.  To this competition of the worker there is\nbut one limit; no worker will work for less than he needs to subsist.  If\nhe must starve, he will prefer to starve in idleness rather than in toil.\nTrue, this limit is relative; one needs more than another, one is\naccustomed to more comfort than another; the Englishman who is still\nsomewhat civilised, needs more than the Irishman who goes in rags, eats\npotatoes, and sleeps in a pig-sty.  But that does not hinder the\nIrishman's competing with the Englishman, and gradually forcing the rate\nof wages, and with it the Englishman's level of civilisation, down to the\nIrishman's level.  Certain kinds of work require a certain grade of\ncivilisation, and to these belong almost all forms of industrial\noccupation; hence the interest of the bourgeoisie requires in this case\nthat wages should be high enough to enable the workman to keep himself\nupon the required plane.\n\nThe newly immigrated Irishman, encamped in the first stable that offers,\nor turned out in the street after a week because he spends everything\nupon drink and cannot pay rent, would be a poor mill-hand.  The mill-hand\nmust, therefore, have wages enough to enable him to bring up his children\nto regular work; but no more, lest he should be able to get on without\nthe wages of his children, and so make something else of them than mere\nworking-men.  Here, too, the limit, the minimum wage, is relative.  When\nevery member of the family works, the individual worker can get on with\nproportionately less, and the bourgeoisie has made the most of the\nopportunity of employing and making profitable the labour of women and\nchildren afforded by machine-work.  Of course it is not in every family\nthat every member can be set to work, and those in which the case is\notherwise would be in a bad way if obliged to exist upon the minimum wage\npossible to a wholly employed family.  Hence the usual wages form an\naverage according to which a fully employed family gets on pretty well,\nand one which embraces few members able to work, pretty badly.  But in\nthe worst case, every working-man prefers surrendering the trifling\nluxury to which he was accustomed to not living at all; prefers a pig-pen\nto no roof, wears rags in preference to going naked, confines himself to\na potato diet in preference to starvation.  He contents himself with half-\npay and the hope of better times rather than be driven into the street to\nperish before the eyes of the world, as so many have done who had no work\nwhatever.  This trifle, therefore, this something more than nothing, is\nthe minimum of wages.  And if there are more workers at hand than the\nbourgeoisie thinks well to employ--if at the end of the battle of\ncompetition there yet remain workers who find nothing to do, they must\nsimply starve; for the bourgeois will hardly give them work if he cannot\nsell the produce of their labour at a profit.\n\nFrom this it is evident what the minimum of wages is.  The maximum is\ndetermined by the competition of the bourgeoisie among themselves; for we\nhave seen how they, too, must compete with each other.  The bourgeois can\nincrease his capital only in commerce and manufacture, and in both cases\nhe needs workers.  Even if he invests his capital at interest, he needs\nthem indirectly; for without commerce and manufacture, no one would pay\nhim interest upon his capital, no one could use it.  So the bourgeois\ncertainly needs workers, not indeed for his immediate living, for at need\nhe could consume his capital, but as we need an article of trade or a\nbeast of burden,--as a means of profit.  The proletarian produces the\ngoods which the bourgeois sells with advantage.  When, therefore, the\ndemand for these goods increases so that all the competing working-men\nare employed, and a few more might perhaps be useful, the competition\namong the workers falls away, and the bourgeoisie begin to compete among\nthemselves.  The capitalist in search of workmen knows very well that his\nprofits increase as prices rise in consequence of the increased demand\nfor his goods, and pays a trifle higher wages rather than let the whole\nprofit escape him.  He sends the butter to fetch the cheese, and getting\nthe latter, leaves the butter ungrudgingly to the workers.  So one\ncapitalist after another goes in chase of workers, and wages rise; but\nonly as high as the increasing demand permits.  If the capitalist, who\nwillingly sacrificed a part of his extraordinary profit, runs into danger\nof sacrificing any part of his ordinary average profit, he takes very\ngood care not to pay more than average wages.\n\nFrom this we can determine the average rate of wages.  Under average\ncircumstances, when neither workers nor capitalists have reason to\ncompete, especially among themselves, when there are just as many workers\nat hand as can be employed in producing precisely the goods that are\ndemanded, wages stand a little above the minimum.  How far they rise\nabove the minimum will depend upon the average needs and the grade of\ncivilisation of the workers.  If the workers are accustomed to eat meat\nseveral times in the week, the capitalists must reconcile themselves to\npaying wages enough to make this food attainable, not less, because the\nworkers are not competing among themselves and have no occasion to\ncontent themselves with less; not more, because the capitalists, in the\nabsence of competition among themselves, have no occasion to attract\nworking-men by extraordinary favours.  This standard of the average needs\nand the average civilisation of the workers has become very complicated\nby reason of the complications of English industry, and is different for\ndifferent sorts of workers, as has been pointed out.  Most industrial\noccupations demand a certain skill and regularity, and for these\nqualities which involve a certain grade of civilisation, the rate of\nwages must be such as to induce the worker to acquire such skill and\nsubject himself to such regularity.  Hence it is that the average wages\nof industrial workers are higher than those of mere porters, day\nlabourers, etc., higher especially than those of agricultural labourers,\na fact to which the additional cost of the necessities of life in cities\ncontributes somewhat.  In other words, the worker is, in law and in fact,\nthe slave of the property-holding class, so effectually a slave that he\nis sold like a piece of goods, rises and falls in value like a commodity.\nIf the demand for workers increases, the price of workers rises; if it\nfalls, their price falls.  If it falls so greatly that a number of them\nbecome unsaleable, if they are left in stock, they are simply left idle;\nand as they cannot live upon that, they die of starvation.  For, to speak\nin the words of the economists, the expense incurred in maintaining them\nwould not be reproduced, would be money thrown away, and to this end no\nman advances capital; and, so far, Malthus was perfectly right in his\ntheory of population.  The only difference as compared with the old,\noutspoken slavery is this, that the worker of to-day seems to be free\nbecause he is not sold once for all, but piecemeal by the day, the week,\nthe year, and because no one owner sells him to another, but he is forced\nto sell himself in this way instead, being the slave of no particular\nperson, but of the whole property-holding class.  For him the matter is\nunchanged at bottom, and if this semblance of liberty necessarily gives\nhim some real freedom on the one hand, it entails on the other the\ndisadvantage that no one guarantees him a subsistence, he is in danger of\nbeing repudiated at any moment by his master, the bourgeoisie, and left\nto die of starvation, if the bourgeoisie ceases to have an interest in\nhis employment, his existence.  The bourgeoisie, on the other hand, is\nfar better off under the present arrangement than under the old slave\nsystem; it can dismiss its employees at discretion without sacrificing\ninvested capital, and gets its work done much more cheaply than is\npossible with slave labour, as Adam Smith comfortingly pointed out. {80}\n\nHence it follows, too, that Adam Smith was perfectly right in making the\nassertion: \"That the demand for men, like that for any other commodity,\nnecessarily regulates the production of men, quickens it when it goes on\ntoo slowly, and stops it when it advances too fast.\"  _Just as in the\ncase of any other commodity_!  If there are too few labourers at hand,\nprices, _i.e_. wages, rise, the workers are more prosperous, marriages\nmultiply, more children are born and more live to grow up, until a\nsufficient number of labourers has been secured.  If there are too many\non hand, prices fall, want of work, poverty, and starvation, and\nconsequent diseases arise, and the \"surplus population\" is put out of the\nway.  And Malthus, who carried the foregoing proposition of Smith\nfarther, was also right, in his way, in asserting that there are always\nmore people on hand than can be maintained from the available means of\nsubsistence.  Surplus population is engendered rather by the competition\nof the workers among themselves, which forces each separate worker to\nlabour as much each day as his strength can possibly admit.  If a\nmanufacturer can employ ten hands nine hours daily, he can employ nine if\neach works ten hours, and the tenth goes hungry.  And if a manufacturer\ncan force the nine hands to work an extra hour daily for the same wages\nby threatening to discharge them at a time when the demand for hands is\nnot very great, he discharges the tenth and saves so much wages.  This is\nthe process on a small scale, which goes on in a nation on a large one.\nThe productiveness of each hand raised to the highest pitch by the\ncompetition of the workers among themselves, the division of labour, the\nintroduction of machinery, the subjugation of the forces of nature,\ndeprive a multitude of workers of bread.  These starving workers are then\nremoved from the market, they can buy nothing, and the quantity of\narticles of consumption previously required by them is no longer in\ndemand, need no longer be produced; the workers previously employed in\nproducing them are therefore driven out of work, and are also removed\nfrom the market, and so it goes on, always the same old round, or rather,\nso it would go if other circumstances did not intervene.  The\nintroduction of the industrial forces already referred to for increasing\nproduction leads, in the course of time, to a reduction of prices of the\narticles produced and to consequent increased consumption, so that a\nlarge part of the displaced workers finally, after long suffering, find\nwork again.  If, in addition to this, the conquest of foreign markets\nconstantly and rapidly increases the demand for manufactured goods, as\nhas been the case in England during the past sixty years, the demand for\nhands increases, and, in proportion to it, the population.  Thus, instead\nof diminishing, the population of the British Empire has increased with\nextraordinary rapidity, and is still increasing.  Yet, in spite of the\nextension of industry, in spite of the demand for working-men which, in\ngeneral, has increased, there is, according to the confession of all the\nofficial political parties (Tory, Whig, and Radical), permanent surplus,\nsuperfluous population; the competition among the workers is constantly\ngreater than the competition to secure workers.\n\nWhence comes this incongruity?  It lies in the nature of industrial\ncompetition and the commercial crises which arise from them.  In the\npresent unregulated production and distribution of the means of\nsubsistence, which is carried on not directly for the sake of supplying\nneeds, but for profit, in the system under which every one works for\nhimself to enrich himself, disturbances inevitably arise at every moment.\nFor example, England supplies a number of countries with most diverse\ngoods.  Now, although the manufacturer may know how much of each article\nis consumed in each country annually, he cannot know how much is on hand\nat every given moment, much less can he know how much his competitors\nexport thither.  He can only draw most uncertain inferences from the\nperpetual fluctuations in prices, as to the quantities on hand and the\nneeds of the moment.  He must trust to luck in exporting his goods.\nEverything is done blindly, as guess-work, more or less at the mercy of\naccident.  Upon the slightest favourable report, each one exports what he\ncan, and before long such a market is glutted, sales stop, capital\nremains inactive, prices fall, and English manufacture has no further\nemployment for its hands.  In the beginning of the development of\nmanufacture, these checks were limited to single branches and single\nmarkets; but the centralising tendency of competition which drives the\nhands thrown out of one branch into such other branches as are most\neasily accessible, and transfers the goods which cannot be disposed of in\none market to other markets, has gradually brought the single minor\ncrises nearer together and united them into one periodically recurring\ncrisis.  Such a crisis usually recurs once in five years after a brief\nperiod of activity and general prosperity; the home market, like all\nforeign ones, is glutted with English goods, which it can only slowly\nabsorb, the industrial movement comes to a standstill in almost every\nbranch, the small manufacturers and merchants who cannot survive a\nprolonged inactivity of their invested capital fail, the larger ones\nsuspend business during the worst season, close their mills or work short\ntime, perhaps half the day; wages fall by reason of the competition of\nthe unemployed, the diminution of working-time and the lack of profitable\nsales; want becomes universal among the workers, the small savings, which\nindividuals may have made, are rapidly consumed, the philanthropic\ninstitutions are overburdened, the poor-rates are doubled, trebled, and\nstill insufficient, the number of the starving increases, and the whole\nmultitude of \"surplus\" population presses in terrific numbers into the\nforeground.  This continues for a time; the \"surplus\" exist as best they\nmay, or perish; philanthropy and the Poor Law help many of them to a\npainful prolongation of their existence.  Others find scant means of\nsubsistence here and there in such kinds of work as have been least open\nto competition, are most remote from manufacture.  And with how little\ncan a human being keep body and soul together for a time!  Gradually the\nstate of things improve; the accumulations of goods are consumed, the\ngeneral depression among the men of commerce and manufacture prevents a\ntoo hasty replenishing of the markets, and at last rising prices and\nfavourable reports from all directions restore activity.  Most of the\nmarkets are distant ones; demand increases and prices rise constantly\nwhile the first exports are arriving; people struggle for the first\ngoods, the first sales enliven trade still more, the prospective ones\npromise still higher prices; expecting a further rise, merchants begin to\nbuy upon speculation, and so to withdraw from consumption the articles\nintended for it, just when they are most needed.  Speculation forces\nprices still higher, by inspiring others to purchase, and appropriating\nnew importations at once.  All this is reported to England, manufacturers\nbegin to produce with a will, new mills are built, every means is\nemployed to make the most of the favourable moment.  Speculation arises\nhere, too, exerting the same influence as upon foreign markets, raising\nprices, withdrawing goods from consumption, spurring manufacture in both\nways to the highest pitch of effort.  Then come the daring speculators\nworking with fictitious capital, living upon credit, ruined if they\ncannot speedily sell; they hurl themselves into this universal,\ndisorderly race for profits, multiply the disorder and haste by their\nunbridled passion, which drives prices and production to madness.  It is\na frantic struggle, which carries away even the most experienced and\nphlegmatic; goods are spun, woven, hammered, as if all mankind were to be\nnewly equipped, as though two thousand million new consumers had been\ndiscovered in the moon.  All at once the shaky speculators abroad, who\nmust have money, begin to sell, below market price, of course, for their\nneed is urgent; one sale is followed by others, prices fluctuate,\nspeculators throw their goods upon the market in terror, the market is\ndisordered, credit shaken, one house after another stops payments,\nbankruptcy follows bankruptcy, and the discovery is made that three times\nmore goods are on hand or under way than can be consumed.  The news\nreaches England, where production has been going on at full speed\nmeanwhile, panic seizes all hands, failures abroad cause others in\nEngland, the panic crushes a number of firms, all reserves are thrown\nupon the market here, too, in the moment of anxiety, and the alarm is\nstill further exaggerated.  This is the beginning of the crisis, which\nthen takes precisely the same course as its predecessor, and gives place\nin turn to a season of prosperity.  So it goes on\nperpetually,--prosperity, crisis, prosperity, crisis, and this perennial\nround in which English industry moves is, as has been before observed,\nusually completed once in five or six years.\n\nFrom this it is clear that English manufacture must have, at all times\nsave the brief periods of highest prosperity, an unemployed reserve army\nof workers, in order to be able to produce the masses of goods required\nby the market in the liveliest months.  This reserve army is larger or\nsmaller, according as the state of the market occasions the employment of\na larger or smaller proportion of its members.  And if at the moment of\nhighest activity of the market the agricultural districts and the\nbranches least affected by the general prosperity temporarily supply to\nmanufacture a number of workers, these are a mere minority, and these too\nbelong to the reserve army, with the single difference that the\nprosperity of the moment was required to reveal their connection with it.\nWhen they enter upon the more active branches of work, their former\nemployers draw in somewhat, in order to feel the loss less, work longer\nhours, employ women and younger workers, and when the wanderers\ndischarged at the beginning of the crisis return, they find their places\nfilled and themselves superfluous--at least in the majority of cases.\nThis reserve army, which embraces an immense multitude during the crisis\nand a large number during the period which may be regarded as the average\nbetween the highest prosperity and the crisis, is the \"surplus\npopulation\" of England, which keeps body and soul together by begging,\nstealing, street-sweeping, collecting manure, pushing handcarts, driving\ndonkeys, peddling, or performing occasional small jobs.  In every great\ntown a multitude of such people may be found.  It is astonishing in what\ndevices this \"surplus population\" takes refuge.  The London\ncrossing-sweepers are known all over the world; but hitherto the\nprincipal streets in all the great cities, as well as the crossings, have\nbeen swept by people out of other work, and employed by the Poor Law\nguardians or the municipal authorities for the purpose.  Now, however, a\nmachine has been invented which rattles through the streets daily, and\nhas spoiled this source of income for the unemployed.  Along the great\nhighways leading into the cities, on which there is a great deal of\nwaggon traffic, a large number of people may be seen with small carts,\ngathering fresh horse-dung at the risk of their lives among the passing\ncoaches and omnibuses, often paying a couple of shillings a week to the\nauthorities for the privilege.  But this occupation is forbidden in many\nplaces, because the ordinary street-sweepings thus impoverished cannot be\nsold as manure.  Happy are such of the \"surplus\" as can obtain a push-\ncart and go about with it.  Happier still those to whom it is vouchsafed\nto possess an ass in addition to the cart.  The ass must get his own food\nor is given a little gathered refuse, and can yet bring in a trifle of\nmoney.  Most of the \"surplus\" betake themselves to huckstering.  On\nSaturday afternoons, especially, when the whole working population is on\nthe streets, the crowd who live from huckstering and peddling may be\nseen.  Shoe and corset laces, braces, twine, cakes, oranges, every kind\nof small articles are offered by men, women, and children; and at other\ntimes also, such peddlers are always to be seen standing at the street\ncorners, or going about with cakes and ginger-beer or nettle-beer.\nMatches and such things, sealing-wax, and patent mixtures for lighting\nfires are further resources of such venders.  Others, so-called jobbers,\ngo about the streets seeking small jobs.  Many of these succeed in\ngetting a day's work, many are not so fortunate.\n\n   \"At the gates of all the London docks,\" says the Rev. W. Champney,\n   preacher of the East End, \"hundreds of the poor appear every morning\n   in winter before daybreak, in the hope of getting a day's work.  They\n   await the opening of the gates; and, when the youngest and strongest\n   and best known have been engaged, hundreds cast down by disappointed\n   hope, go back to their wretched homes.\"\n\nWhen these people find no work and will not rebel against society, what\nremains for them but to beg?  And surely no one can wonder at the great\narmy of beggars, most of them able-bodied men, with whom the police\ncarries on perpetual war.  But the beggary of these men has a peculiar\ncharacter.  Such a man usually goes about with his family singing a\npleading song in the streets or appealing, in a speech, to the\nbenevolence of the passers-by.  And it is a striking fact that these\nbeggars are seen almost exclusively in the working-people's districts,\nthat it is almost exclusively the gifts of the poor from which they live.\nOr the family takes up its position in a busy street, and without\nuttering a word, lets the mere sight of its helplessness plead for it.  In\nthis case, too, they reckon upon the sympathy of the workers alone, who\nknow from experience how it feels to be hungry, and are liable to find\nthemselves in the same situation at any moment; for this dumb, yet most\nmoving appeal, is met with almost solely in such streets as are\nfrequented by working-men, and at such hours as working-men pass by; but\nespecially on summer evenings, when the \"secrets\" of the working-people's\nquarters are generally revealed, and the middle-class withdraws as far as\npossible from the district thus polluted.  And he among the \"surplus\" who\nhas courage and passion enough openly to resist society, to reply with\ndeclared war upon the bourgeoisie to the disguised war which the\nbourgeoisie wages upon him, goes forth to rob, plunder, murder, and burn!\n\nOf this surplus population there are, according to the reports of the\nPoor Law commissioners, on an average, a million and a half in England\nand Wales; in Scotland the number cannot be ascertained for want of Poor\nLaw regulations, and with Ireland we shall deal separately.  Moreover,\nthis million and a half includes only those who actually apply to the\nparish for relief; the great multitude who struggle on without recourse\nto this most hated expedient, it does not embrace.  On the other hand, a\ngood part of the number belongs to the agricultural districts, and does\nnot enter into the present discussion.  During a crisis this number\nnaturally increases markedly, and want reaches its highest pitch.  Take,\nfor instance, the crisis of 1842, which, being the latest, was the most\nviolent; for the intensity of the crisis increases with each repetition,\nand the next, which may be expected not later than 1847, {87} will\nprobably be still more violent and lasting.  During this crisis the poor-\nrates rose in every town to a hitherto unknown height.  In Stockport,\namong other towns, for every pound paid in house-rent, eight shillings of\npoor-rate had to be paid, so that the rate alone formed forty per cent.\nof the house-rent.  Moreover, whole streets stood vacant, so that there\nwere at least twenty thousand fewer inhabitants than usual, and on the\ndoors of the empty houses might be read: \"Stockport to let.\"  In Bolton,\nwhere, in ordinary years, the rents from which rates are paid average\n86,000 pounds, they sank to 36,000 pounds.  The number of the poor to be\nsupported rose, on the other hand, to 14,000, or more than twenty per\ncent. of the whole number of inhabitants.  In Leeds, the Poor Law\nguardians had a reserve fund of 10,000 pounds.  This, with a contribution\nof 7,000 pounds, was wholly exhausted before the crisis reached its\nheight.  So it was everywhere.  A report drawn up in January, 1843, by a\ncommittee of the Anti-Corn Law League, on the condition of the industrial\ndistricts in 1842, which was based upon detailed statements of the\nmanufacturers, asserts that the poor-rate was, taking the average, twice\nas high as in 1839, and that the number of persons requiring relief has\ntrebled, even quintupled, since that time; that a multitude of applicants\nbelong to a class which had never before solicited relief; that the\nworking-class commands more than two-thirds less of the means of\nsubsistence than from 1834-1836; that the consumption of meat had been\ndecidedly less, in some places twenty per cent., in others reaching sixty\nper cent. less; that even handicraftsmen, smiths, bricklayers, and\nothers, who usually have full employment in the most depressed periods,\nnow suffered greatly from want of work and reduction of wages; and that,\neven now, in January, 1843, wages are still steadily falling.  And these\nare the reports of manufacturers!  The starving workmen, whose mills were\nidle, whose employers could give them no work, stood in the streets in\nall directions, begged singly or in crowds, besieged the sidewalks in\narmies, and appealed to the passers-by for help; they begged, not\ncringing like ordinary beggars, but threatening by their numbers, their\ngestures, and their words.  Such was the state of things in all the\nindustrial districts, from Leicester to Leeds, and from Manchester to\nBirmingham.  Here and there disturbances arose, as in the Staffordshire\npotteries, in July.  The most frightful excitement prevailed among the\nworkers until the general insurrection broke out throughout the\nmanufacturing districts in August.  When I came to Manchester in\nNovember, 1842, there were crowds of unemployed working-men at every\nstreet corner, and many mills were still standing idle.  In the following\nmonths these unwilling corner loafers gradually vanished, and the\nfactories came into activity once more.\n\nTo what extent want and suffering prevail among these unemployed during\nsuch a crisis, I need not describe.  The poor-rates are insufficient,\nvastly insufficient; the philanthropy of the rich is a rain-drop in the\nocean, lost in the moment of falling, beggary can support but few among\nthe crowds.  If the small dealers did not sell to the working-people on\ncredit at such times as long as possible--paying themselves liberally\nafterwards, it must be confessed--and if the working-people did not help\neach other, every crisis would remove a multitude of the surplus through\ndeath by starvation.  Since, however, the most depressed period is brief,\nlasting, at worst, but one, two, or two and a half years, most of them\nemerge from it with their lives after dire privations.  But indirectly by\ndisease, etc., every crisis finds a multitude of victims, as we shall\nsee.  First, however, let us turn to another cause of abasement to which\nthe English worker is exposed, a cause permanently active in forcing the\nwhole class downwards.\n\n\n\n\nIRISH IMMIGRATION.\n\n\nWe have already referred several times in passing to the Irish who have\nimmigrated into England; and we shall now have to investigate more\nclosely the causes and results of this immigration.  The rapid extension\nof English industry could not have taken place if England had not\npossessed in the numerous and impoverished population of Ireland a\nreserve at command.  The Irish had nothing to lose at home, and much to\ngain in England; and from the time when it became known in Ireland that\nthe east side of St. George's Channel offered steady work and good pay\nfor strong arms, every year has brought armies of the Irish hither.  It\nhas been calculated that more than a million have already immigrated, and\nnot far from fifty thousand still come every year, nearly all of whom\nenter the industrial districts, especially the great cities, and there\nform the lowest class of the population.  Thus there are in London,\n120,000; in Manchester, 40,000; in Liverpool, 34,000; Bristol, 24,000;\nGlasgow, 40,000; Edinburgh, 29,000, poor Irish people. {90a}  These\npeople having grown up almost without civilisation, accustomed from youth\nto every sort of privation, rough, intemperate, and improvident, bring\nall their brutal habits with them among a class of the English population\nwhich has, in truth, little inducement to cultivate education and\nmorality.  Let us hear Thomas Carlyle upon this subject: {90b}\n\n   \"The wild Milesian features, looking false ingenuity, restlessness,\n   unreason, misery, and mockery, salute you on all highways and byways.\n   The English coachman, as he whirls past, lashes the Milesian with his\n   whip, curses him with his tongue; the Milesian is holding out his hat\n   to beg.  He is the sorest evil this country has to strive with.  In\n   his rags and laughing savagery, he is there to undertake all work that\n   can be done by mere strength of hand and back--for wages that will\n   purchase him potatoes.  He needs only salt for condiment, he lodges to\n   his mind in any pig-hutch or dog-hutch, roosts in outhouses, and wears\n   a suit of tatters, the getting on and off of which is said to be a\n   difficult operation, transacted only in festivals and the high tides\n   of the calendar.  The Saxon-man, if he cannot work on these terms,\n   finds no work.  The uncivilised Irishman, not by his strength, but by\n   the opposite of strength, drives the Saxon native out, takes\n   possession in his room.  There abides he, in his squalor and unreason,\n   in his falsity and drunken violence, as the ready-made nucleus of\n   degradation and disorder.  Whoever struggles, swimming with\n   difficulty, may now find an example how the human being can exist not\n   swimming, but sunk.  That the condition of the lower multitude of\n   English labourers approximates more and more to that of the Irish,\n   competing with them in all the markets: that whatsoever labour, to\n   which mere strength with little skill will suffice, is to be done,\n   will be done not at the English price, but at an approximation to the\n   Irish price; at a price superior as yet to the Irish, that is,\n   superior to scarcity of potatoes for thirty weeks yearly; superior,\n   yet hourly, with the arrival of every new steamboat, sinking nearer to\n   an equality with that.\"\n\nIf we except his exaggerated and one-sided condemnation of the Irish\nnational character, Carlyle is perfectly right.  These Irishmen who\nmigrate for fourpence to England, on the deck of a steamship on which\nthey are often packed like cattle, insinuate themselves everywhere.  The\nworst dwellings are good enough for them; their clothing causes them\nlittle trouble, so long as it holds together by a single thread; shoes\nthey know not; their food consists of potatoes and potatoes only;\nwhatever they earn beyond these needs they spend upon drink.  What does\nsuch a race want with high wages?  The worst quarters of all the large\ntowns are inhabited by Irishmen.  Whenever a district is distinguished\nfor especial filth and especial ruinousness, the explorer may safely\ncount upon meeting chiefly those Celtic faces which one recognises at the\nfirst glance as different from the Saxon physiognomy of the native, and\nthe singing, aspirate brogue which the true Irishman never loses.  I have\noccasionally heard the Irish-Celtic language spoken in the most thickly\npopulated parts of Manchester.  The majority of the families who live in\ncellars are almost everywhere of Irish origin.  In short, the Irish have,\nas Dr. Kay says, discovered the minimum of the necessities of life, and\nare now making the English workers acquainted with it.  Filth and\ndrunkenness, too, they have brought with them.  The lack of cleanliness,\nwhich is not so injurious in the country, where population is scattered,\nand which is the Irishman's second nature, becomes terrifying and gravely\ndangerous through its concentration here in the great cities.  The\nMilesian deposits all garbage and filth before his house door here, as he\nwas accustomed to do at home, and so accumulates the pools and dirt-heaps\nwhich disfigure the working-people's quarters and poison the air.  He\nbuilds a pig-sty against the house wall as he did at home, and if he is\nprevented from doing this, he lets the pig sleep in the room with\nhimself.  This new and unnatural method of cattle-raising in cities is\nwholly of Irish origin.  The Irishman loves his pig as the Arab his\nhorse, with the difference that he sells it when it is fat enough to\nkill.  Otherwise, he eats and sleeps with it, his children play with it,\nride upon it, roll in the dirt with it, as any one may see a thousand\ntimes repeated in all the great towns of England.  The filth and\ncomfortlessness that prevail in the houses themselves it is impossible to\ndescribe.  The Irishman is unaccustomed to the presence of furniture; a\nheap of straw, a few rags, utterly beyond use as clothing, suffice for\nhis nightly couch.  A piece of wood, a broken chair, an old chest for a\ntable, more he needs not; a tea-kettle, a few pots and dishes, equip his\nkitchen, which is also his sleeping and living room.  When he is in want\nof fuel, everything combustible within his reach, chairs, door-posts,\nmouldings, flooring, finds its way up the chimney.  Moreover, why should\nhe need much room?  At home in his mud-cabin there was only one room for\nall domestic purposes; more than one room his family does not need in\nEngland.  So the custom of crowding many persons into a single room, now\nso universal, has been chiefly implanted by the Irish immigration.  And\nsince the poor devil must have one enjoyment, and society has shut him\nout of all others, he betakes himself to the drinking of spirits.  Drink\nis the only thing which makes the Irishman's life worth having, drink and\nhis cheery care-free temperament; so he revels in drink to the point of\nthe most bestial drunkenness.  The southern facile character of the\nIrishman, his crudity, which places him but little above the savage, his\ncontempt for all humane enjoyments, in which his very crudeness makes him\nincapable of sharing, his filth and poverty, all favour drunkenness.  The\ntemptation is great, he cannot resist it, and so when he has money he\ngets rid of it down his throat.  What else should he do?  How can society\nblame him when it places him in a position in which he almost of\nnecessity becomes a drunkard; when it leaves him to himself, to his\nsavagery?\n\nWith such a competitor the English working-man has to struggle with a\ncompetitor upon the lowest plane possible in a civilised country, who for\nthis very reason requires less wages than any other.  Nothing else is\ntherefore possible than that, as Carlyle says, the wages of English\nworking-men should be forced down further and further in every branch in\nwhich the Irish compete with him.  And these branches are many.  All such\nas demand little or no skill are open to the Irish.  For work which\nrequires long training or regular, pertinacious application, the\ndissolute, unsteady, drunken Irishman is on too low a plane.  To become a\nmechanic, a mill-hand, he would have to adopt the English civilisation,\nthe English customs, become, in the main, an Englishman.  But for all\nsimple, less exact work, wherever it is a question more of strength than\nskill, the Irishman is as good as the Englishman.  Such occupations are\ntherefore especially overcrowded with Irishmen: hand-weavers,\nbricklayers, porters, jobbers, and such workers, count hordes of Irishmen\namong their number, and the pressure of this race has done much to\ndepress wages and lower the working-class.  And even if the Irish, who\nhave forced their way into other occupations, should become more\ncivilised, enough of the old habits would cling to them to have a strong\ndegrading influence upon their English companions in toil, especially in\nview of the general effect of being surrounded by the Irish.  For when,\nin almost every great city, a fifth or a quarter of the workers are\nIrish, or children of Irish parents, who have grown up among Irish filth,\nno one can wonder if the life, habits, intelligence, moral status--in\nshort, the whole character of the working-class assimilates a great part\nof the Irish characteristics.  On the contrary, it is easy to understand\nhow the degrading position of the English workers, engendered by our\nmodern history, and its immediate consequences, has been still more\ndegraded by the presence of Irish competition.\n\n\n\n\nRESULTS.\n\n\nHaving now investigated, somewhat in detail, the conditions under which\nthe English working-class lives, it is time to draw some further\ninferences from the facts presented, and then to compare our inferences\nwith the actual state of things.  Let us see what the workers themselves\nhave become under the given circumstances, what sort of people they are,\nwhat their physical, mental, and moral status.\n\nWhen one individual inflicts bodily injury upon another, such injury that\ndeath results, we call the deed manslaughter; when the assailant knew in\nadvance that the injury would be fatal, we call his deed murder.  But\nwhen society {95} places hundreds of proletarians in such a position that\nthey inevitably meet a too early and an unnatural death, one which is\nquite as much a death by violence as that by the sword or bullet; when it\ndeprives thousands of the necessaries of life, places them under\nconditions in which they _cannot_ live--forces them, through the strong\narm of the law, to remain in such conditions until that death ensues\nwhich is the inevitable consequence--knows that these thousands of\nvictims must perish, and yet permits these conditions to remain, its deed\nis murder just as surely as the deed of the single individual; disguised,\nmalicious murder, murder against which none can defend himself, which\ndoes not seem what it is, because no man sees the murderer, because the\ndeath of the victim seems a natural one, since the offence is more one of\nomission than of commission.  But murder it remains.  I have now to prove\nthat society in England daily and hourly commits what the working-men's\norgans, with perfect correctness, characterise as social murder, that it\nhas placed the workers under conditions in which they can neither retain\nhealth nor live long; that it undermines the vital force of these workers\ngradually, little by little, and so hurries them to the grave before\ntheir time.  I have further to prove that society knows how injurious\nsuch conditions are to the health and the life of the workers, and yet\ndoes nothing to improve these conditions.  That it _knows_ the\nconsequences of its deeds; that its act is, therefore, not mere\nmanslaughter, but murder, I shall have proved, when I cite official\ndocuments, reports of Parliament and of the Government, in substantiation\nof my charge.\n\nThat a class which lives under the conditions already sketched and is so\nill-provided with the most necessary means of subsistence, cannot be\nhealthy and can reach no advanced age, is self-evident.  Let us review\nthe circumstances once more with especial reference to the health of the\nworkers.  The centralisation of population in great cities exercises of\nitself an unfavourable influence; the atmosphere of London can never be\nso pure, so rich in oxygen, as the air of the country; two and a half\nmillion pairs of lungs, two hundred and fifty thousand fires, crowded\nupon an area three to four miles square, consume an enormous amount of\noxygen, which is replaced with difficulty, because the method of building\ncities in itself impedes ventilation.  The carbonic acid gas, engendered\nby respiration and fire, remains in the streets by reason of its specific\ngravity, and the chief air current passes over the roofs of the city.  The\nlungs of the inhabitants fail to receive the due supply of oxygen, and\nthe consequence is mental and physical lassitude and low vitality.  For\nthis reason, the dwellers in cities are far less exposed to acute, and\nespecially to inflammatory, affections than rural populations, who live\nin a free, normal atmosphere; but they suffer the more from chronic\naffections.  And if life in large cities is, in itself, injurious to\nhealth, how great must be the harmful influence of an abnormal atmosphere\nin the working-people's quarters, where, as we have seen, everything\ncombines to poison the air.  In the country, it may, perhaps, be\ncomparatively innoxious to keep a dung-heap adjoining one's dwelling,\nbecause the air has free ingress from all sides; but in the midst of a\nlarge town, among closely built lanes and courts that shut out all\nmovement of the atmosphere, the case is different.  All putrefying\nvegetable and animal substances give off gases decidedly injurious to\nhealth, and if these gases have no free way of escape, they inevitably\npoison the atmosphere.  The filth and stagnant pools of the\nworking-people's quarters in the great cities have, therefore, the worst\neffect upon the public health, because they produce precisely those gases\nwhich engender disease; so, too, the exhalations from contaminated\nstreams.  But this is by no means all.  The manner in which the great\nmultitude of the poor is treated by society to-day is revolting.  They\nare drawn into the large cities where they breathe a poorer atmosphere\nthan in the country; they are relegated to districts which, by reason of\nthe method of construction, are worse ventilated than any others; they\nare deprived of all means of cleanliness, of water itself, since pipes\nare laid only when paid for, and the rivers so polluted that they are\nuseless for such purposes; they are obliged to throw all offal and\ngarbage, all dirty water, often all disgusting drainage and excrement\ninto the streets, being without other means of disposing of them; they\nare thus compelled to infect the region of their own dwellings.  Nor is\nthis enough.  All conceivable evils are heaped upon the heads of the\npoor.  If the population of great cities is too dense in general, it is\nthey in particular who are packed into the least space.  As though the\nvitiated atmosphere of the streets were not enough, they are penned in\ndozens into single rooms, so that the air which they breathe at night is\nenough in itself to stifle them.  They are given damp dwellings, cellar\ndens that are not waterproof from below, or garrets that leak from above.\nTheir houses are so built that the clammy air cannot escape.  They are\nsupplied bad, tattered, or rotten clothing, adulterated and indigestible\nfood.  They are exposed to the most exciting changes of mental condition,\nthe most violent vibrations between hope and fear; they are hunted like\ngame, and not permitted to attain peace of mind and quiet enjoyment of\nlife.  They are deprived of all enjoyments except that of sexual\nindulgence and drunkenness, are worked every day to the point of complete\nexhaustion of their mental and physical energies, and are thus constantly\nspurred on to the maddest excess in the only two enjoyments at their\ncommand.  And if they surmount all this, they fall victims to want of\nwork in a crisis when all the little is taken from them that had hitherto\nbeen vouchsafed them.\n\nHow is it possible, under such conditions, for the lower class to be\nhealthy and long lived?  What else can be expected than an excessive\nmortality, an unbroken series of epidemics, a progressive deterioration\nin the physique of the working population?  Let us see how the facts\nstand.\n\nThat the dwellings of the workers in the worst portions of the cities,\ntogether with the other conditions of life of this class, engender\nnumerous diseases, is attested on all sides.  The article already quoted\nfrom the _Artisan_ asserts with perfect truth, that lung diseases must be\nthe inevitable consequence of such conditions, and that, indeed, cases of\nthis kind are disproportionately frequent in this class.  That the bad\nair of London, and especially of the working-people's districts, is in\nthe highest degree favourable to the development of consumption, the\nhectic appearance of great numbers of persons sufficiently indicates.  If\none roams the streets a little in the early morning, when the multitudes\nare on their way to their work, one is amazed at the number of persons\nwho look wholly or half-consumptive.  Even in Manchester the people have\nnot the same appearance; these pale, lank, narrow-chested, hollow-eyed\nghosts, whom one passes at every step, these languid, flabby faces,\nincapable of the slightest energetic expression, I have seen in such\nstartling numbers only in London, though consumption carries off a horde\nof victims annually in the factory towns of the North.  In competition\nwith consumption stands typhus, to say nothing of scarlet fever, a\ndisease which brings most frightful devastation into the ranks of the\nworking-class.  Typhus, that universally diffused affliction, is\nattributed by the official report on the sanitary condition of the\nworking-class, directly to the bad state of the dwellings in the matters\nof ventilation, drainage, and cleanliness.  This report, compiled, it\nmust not be forgotten, by the leading physicians of England from the\ntestimony of other physicians, asserts that a single ill-ventilated\ncourt, a single blind alley without drainage, is enough to engender\nfever, and usually does engender it, especially if the inhabitants are\ngreatly crowded.  This fever has the same character almost everywhere,\nand develops in nearly every case into specific typhus.  It is to be\nfound in the working-people's quarters of all great towns and cities, and\nin single ill-built, ill-kept streets of smaller places, though it\nnaturally seeks out single victims in better districts also.  In London\nit has now prevailed for a considerable time; its extraordinary violence\nin the year 1837 gave rise to the report already referred to.  According\nto the annual report of Dr. Southwood Smith on the London Fever Hospital,\nthe number of patients in 1843 was 1,462, or 418 more than in any\nprevious year.  In the damp, dirty regions of the north, south, and east\ndistricts of London, this disease raged with extraordinary violence.  Many\nof the patients were working-people from the country, who had endured the\nseverest privation while migrating, and, after their arrival, had slept\nhungry and half-naked in the streets, and so fallen victims to the fever.\nThese people were brought into the hospital in such a state of weakness,\nthat unusual quantities of wine, cognac, and preparations of ammonia and\nother stimulants were required for their treatment; 16.5 per cent. of all\npatients died.  This malignant fever is to be found in Manchester; in the\nworst quarters of the Old Town, Ancoats, Little Ireland, etc., it is\nrarely extinct; though here, as in the _English_ towns generally, it\nprevails to a less extent than might be expected.  In Scotland and\nIreland, on the other hand, it rages with a violence that surpasses all\nconception.  In Edinburgh and Glasgow it broke out in 1817, after the\nfamine, and in 1826 and 1837 with especial violence, after the commercial\ncrisis, subsiding somewhat each time after having raged about three\nyears.  In Edinburgh about 6,000 persons were attacked by the fever\nduring the epidemic of 1817, and about 10,000 in that of 1837, and not\nonly the number of persons attacked but the violence of the disease\nincreased with each repetition. {100a}\n\nBut the fury of the epidemic in all former periods seems to have been\nchild's play in comparison with its ravages after the crisis of 1842.  One-\nsixth of the whole indigent population of Scotland was seized by the\nfever, and the infection was carried by wandering beggars with fearful\nrapidity from one locality to another.  It did not reach the middle and\nupper classes of the population, yet in two months there were more fever\ncases than in twelve years before.  In Glasgow, twelve per cent. of the\npopulation were seized in the year 1843; 32,000 persons, of whom thirty-\ntwo per cent. perished, while this mortality in Manchester and Liverpool\ndoes not ordinarily exceed eight per cent.  The illness reached a crisis\non the seventh and fifteenth days; on the latter, the patient usually\nbecame yellow, which our authority {100b} regards as an indication that\nthe cause of the malady was to be sought in mental excitement and\nanxiety.  In Ireland, too, these fever epidemics have become\ndomesticated.  During twenty-one months of the years 1817-1818, 39,000\nfever patients passed through the Dublin hospital; and in a more recent\nyear, according to Sheriff Alison, {100c} 60,000.  In Cork the fever\nhospital received one-seventh of the population in 1817-1818, in Limerick\nin the same time one-fourth, and in the bad quarter of Waterford,\nnineteen-twentieths of the whole population were ill of the fever at one\ntime.\n\nWhen one remembers under what conditions the working-people live, when\none thinks how crowded their dwellings are, how every nook and corner\nswarms with human beings, how sick and well sleep in the same room, in\nthe same bed, the only wonder is that a contagious disease like this\nfever does not spread yet farther.  And when one reflects how little\nmedical assistance the sick have at command, how many are without any\nmedical advice whatsoever, and ignorant of the most ordinary\nprecautionary measures, the mortality seems actually small.  Dr. Alison,\nwho has made a careful study of this disease, attributes it directly to\nthe want and the wretched condition of the poor, as in the report already\nquoted.  He asserts that privations and the insufficient satisfaction of\nvital needs are what prepare the frame for contagion and make the\nepidemic widespread and terrible.  He proves that a period of privation,\na commercial crisis or a bad harvest, has each time produced the typhus\nepidemic in Ireland as in Scotland, and that the fury of the plague has\nfallen almost exclusively on the working-class.  It is a noteworthy fact,\nthat according to his testimony, the majority of persons who perish by\ntyphus are fathers of families, precisely the persons who can least be\nspared by those dependent upon them; and several Irish physicians whom he\nquotes bear the same testimony.\n\nAnother category of diseases arises directly from the food rather than\nthe dwellings of the workers.  The food of the labourer, indigestible\nenough in itself, is utterly unfit for young children, and he has neither\nmeans nor time to get his children more suitable food.  Moreover, the\ncustom of giving children spirits, and even opium, is very general; and\nthese two influences, with the rest of the conditions of life prejudicial\nto bodily development, give rise to the most diverse affections of the\ndigestive organs, leaving life-long traces behind them.  Nearly all\nworkers have stomachs more or less weak, and are yet forced to adhere to\nthe diet which is the root of the evil.  How should they know what is to\nblame for it?  And if they knew, how could they obtain a more suitable\nregimen so long as they cannot adopt a different way of living and are\nnot better educated?  But new disease arises during childhood from\nimpaired digestion.  Scrofula is almost universal among the\nworking-class, and scrofulous parents have scrofulous children,\nespecially when the original influences continue in full force to operate\nupon the inherited tendency of the children.  A second consequence of\nthis insufficient bodily nourishment, during the years of growth and\ndevelopment, is rachitis, which is extremely common among the children of\nthe working-class.  The hardening of the bones is delayed, the\ndevelopment of the skeleton in general is restricted, and deformities of\nthe legs and spinal column are frequent, in addition to the usual\nrachitic affections.  How greatly all these evils are increased by the\nchanges to which the workers are subject in consequence of fluctuations\nin trade, want of work, and the scanty wages in time of crisis, it is not\nnecessary to dwell upon.  Temporary want of sufficient food, to which\nalmost every working-man is exposed at least once in the course of his\nlife, only contributes to intensify the effects of his usual sufficient\nbut bad diet.  Children who are half-starved, just when they most need\nample and nutritious food--and how many such there are during every\ncrisis and even when trade is at its best--must inevitably become weak,\nscrofulous and rachitic in a high degree.  And that they do become so,\ntheir appearance amply shows.  The neglect to which the great mass of\nworking-men's children are condemned leaves ineradicable traces and\nbrings the enfeeblement of the whole race of workers with it.  Add to\nthis, the unsuitable clothing of this class, the impossibility of\nprecautions against colds, the necessity of toiling so long as health\npermits, want made more dire when sickness appears, and the only too\ncommon lack of all medical assistance; and we have a rough idea of the\nsanitary condition of the English working-class.  The injurious effects\npeculiar to single employments as now conducted, I shall not deal with\nhere.\n\nBesides these, there are other influences which enfeeble the health of a\ngreat number of workers, intemperance most of all.  All possible\ntemptations, all allurements combine to bring the workers to drunkenness.\nLiquor is almost their only source of pleasure, and all things conspire\nto make it accessible to them.  The working-man comes from his work\ntired, exhausted, finds his home comfortless, damp, dirty, repulsive; he\nhas urgent need of recreation, he _must_ have something to make work\nworth his trouble, to make the prospect of the next day endurable.  His\nunnerved, uncomfortable, hypochondriac state of mind and body arising\nfrom his unhealthy condition, and especially from indigestion, is\naggravated beyond endurance by the general conditions of his life, the\nuncertainty of his existence, his dependence upon all possible accidents\nand chances, and his inability to do anything towards gaining an assured\nposition.  His enfeebled frame, weakened by bad air and bad food,\nviolently demands some external stimulus; his social need can be\ngratified only in the public-house, he has absolutely no other place\nwhere he can meet his friends.  How can he be expected to resist the\ntemptation?  It is morally and physically inevitable that, under such\ncircumstances, a very large number of working-men should fall into\nintemperance.  And apart from the chiefly physical influences which drive\nthe working-man into drunkenness, there is the example of the great mass,\nthe neglected education, the impossibility of protecting the young from\ntemptation, in many cases the direct influence of intemperate parents,\nwho give their own children liquor, the certainty of forgetting for an\nhour or two the wretchedness and burden of life, and a hundred other\ncircumstances so mighty that the workers can, in truth, hardly be blamed\nfor yielding to such overwhelming pressure.  Drunkenness has here ceased\nto be a vice, for which the vicious can be held responsible; it becomes a\nphenomenon, the necessary, inevitable effect of certain conditions upon\nan object possessed of no volition in relation to those conditions.  They\nwho have degraded the working-man to a mere object have the\nresponsibility to bear.  But as inevitably as a great number of working-\nmen fall a prey to drink, just so inevitably does it manifest its ruinous\ninfluence upon the body and mind of its victims.  All the tendencies to\ndisease arising from the conditions of life of the workers are promoted\nby it, it stimulates in the highest degree the development of lung and\ndigestive troubles, the rise and spread of typhus epidemics.\n\nAnother source of physical mischief to the working-class lies in the\nimpossibility of employing skilled physicians in cases of illness.  It is\ntrue that a number of charitable institutions strive to supply this want,\nthat the infirmary in Manchester, for instance, receives or gives advice\nand medicine to 2,200 patients annually.  But what is that in a city in\nwhich, according to Gaskell's calculation, {104} three-fourths of the\npopulation need medical aid every year?  English doctors charge high\nfees, and working-men are not in a position to pay them.  They can\ntherefore do nothing, or are compelled to call in cheap charlatans, and\nuse quack remedies, which do more harm than good.  An immense number of\nsuch quacks thrive in every English town, securing their _clientele_\namong the poor by means of advertisements, posters, and other such\ndevices.  Besides these, vast quantities of patent medicines are sold,\nfor all conceivable ailments: Morrison's Pills, Parr's Life Pills, Dr.\nMainwaring's Pills, and a thousand other pills, essences, and balsams,\nall of which have the property of curing all the ills that flesh is heir\nto.  These medicines rarely contain actually injurious substances, but,\nwhen taken freely and often, they affect the system prejudicially; and as\nthe unwary purchasers are always recommended to take as much as possible,\nit is not to be wondered at that they swallow them wholesale whether\nwanted or not.\n\nIt is by no means unusual for the manufacturer of Parr's Life Pills to\nsell twenty to twenty-five thousand boxes of these salutary pills in a\nweek, and they are taken for constipation by this one, for diarrhoea by\nthat one, for fever, weakness, and all possible ailments.  As our German\npeasants are cupped or bled at certain seasons, so do the English working-\npeople now consume patent medicines to their own injury and the great\nprofit of the manufacturer.  One of the most injurious of these patent\nmedicines is a drink prepared with opiates, chiefly laudanum, under the\nname Godfrey's Cordial.  Women who work at home, and have their own and\nother people's children to take care of, give them this drink to keep\nthem quiet, and, as many believe, to strengthen them.  They often begin\nto give this medicine to newly-born children, and continue, without\nknowing the effects of this \"heartsease,\" until the children die.  The\nless susceptible the child's system to the action of the opium, the\ngreater the quantities administered.  When the cordial ceases to act,\nlaudanum alone is given, often to the extent of fifteen to twenty drops\nat a dose.  The Coroner of Nottingham testified before a Parliamentary\nCommission {105a} that one apothecary had, according to his own\nstatement, used thirteen hundredweight of laudanum in one year in the\npreparation of Godfrey's Cordial.  The effects upon the children so\ntreated may be readily imagined.  They are pale, feeble, wilted, and\nusually die before completing the second year.  The use of this cordial\nis very extensive in all great towns and industrial districts in the\nkingdom.\n\nThe result of all these influences is a general enfeeblement of the frame\nin the working-class.  There are few vigorous, well-built, healthy\npersons among the workers, _i.e_., among the factory operatives, who are\nemployed in confined rooms, and we are here discussing these only.  They\nare almost all weakly, of angular but not powerful build, lean, pale, and\nof relaxed fibre, with the exception of the muscles especially exercised\nin their work.  Nearly all suffer from indigestion, and consequently from\na more or less hypochondriac, melancholy, irritable, nervous condition.\nTheir enfeebled constitutions are unable to resist disease, and are\ntherefore seized by it on every occasion.  Hence they age prematurely,\nand die early.  On this point the mortality statistics supply\nunquestionable testimony.\n\nAccording to the Report of Registrar-General Graham, the annual death-\nrate of all England and Wales is something less than 2.25 per cent.  That\nis to say, out of forty-five persons, one dies every year. {105b}  This\nwas the average for the year 1839-40.  In 1840-41 the mortality\ndiminished somewhat, and the death-rate was but one in forty-six.  But in\nthe great cities the proportion is wholly different.  I have before me\nofficial tables of mortality (_Manchester Guardian_, July 31st, 1844),\naccording to which the death-rate of several large towns is as\nfollows:--In Manchester, including Chorlton and Salford, one in 32.72;\nand excluding Chorlton and Salford, one in 30.75.  In Liverpool,\nincluding West Derby (suburb), 31.90, and excluding West Derby, 29.90;\nwhile the average of all the districts of Cheshire, Lancashire, and\nYorkshire cited, including a number of wholly or partially rural\ndistricts and many small towns, with a total population of 2,172,506 for\nthe whole, is one death in 39.80 persons.  How unfavourably the workers\nare placed in the great cities, the mortality for Prescott in Lancashire\nshows: a district inhabited by miners, and showing a lower sanitary\ncondition than that of the agricultural districts, mining being by no\nmeans a healthful occupation.  But these miners live in the country, and\nthe death-rate among them is but one in 47.54, or nearly two-and-a-half\nper cent. better than that for all England.  All these statements are\nbased upon the mortality tables for 1843.  Still higher is the death-rate\nin the Scotch cities; in Edinburgh, in 1838-39, one in 29; in 1831, in\nthe Old Town alone, one in 22.  In Glasgow, according to Dr. Cowen, {106}\nthe average has been, since 1830, one in 30; and in single years, one in\n22 to 24.  That this enormous shortening of life falls chiefly upon the\nworking-class, that the general average is improved by the smaller\nmortality of the upper and middle-classes, is attested upon all sides.\nOne of the most recent depositions is that of a physician, Dr. P. H.\nHolland, in Manchester, who investigated Chorlton-on-Medlock, a suburb of\nManchester, under official commission.  He divided the houses and streets\ninto three classes each, and ascertained the following variations in the\ndeath-rate:\n\nFirst class of Streets.  Houses   I. class.  Mortality one in 51\n,,     ,,                  ,,    II. ,,       ,,      ,,      45\n,,     ,,                  ,,   III. ,,       ,,      ,,      36\nSecond ,,                  ,,     I. ,,       ,,      ,,      55\n,,     ,,                  ,,    II. ,,       ,,      ,,      38\n,,     ,,                  ,,   III. ,,       ,,      ,,      35\nThird  ,,                  ,,     I. ,,      Wanting  ---   ----\n,,     ,,                  ,,    II. ,,      Mortality ,,     35\n,,     ,,                  ,,   III. ,,       ,,      ,,      25\n\nIt is clear from other tables given by Holland that the mortality in the\n_streets_ of the second class is 18 per cent. greater, and in the streets\nof the third class 68 per cent. greater than in those of the first class;\nthat the mortality in the _houses_ of the second class is 31 per cent\ngreater, and in the third class 78 per cent. greater than in those of the\nfirst class; that the mortality is those bad streets which were improved,\ndecreased 25 per cent.  He closes with the remark, very frank for an\nEnglish bourgeois: {107}\n\n   \"When we find the rate of mortality four times as high in some streets\n   as in others, and twice as high in whole classes of streets as in\n   other classes, and further find that it is all but invariably high in\n   those streets which are in bad condition, and almost invariably low in\n   those whose condition is good, we cannot resist the conclusion that\n   multitudes of our fellow-creatures, _hundreds of our immediate\n   neighbours_, are annually destroyed for want of the most evident\n   precautions.\"\n\nThe Report on the Sanitary Condition of the Working-Class contains\ninformation which attests the same fact.  In Liverpool, in 1840, the\naverage longevity of the upper-classes, gentry, professional men, etc.,\nwas thirty-five years; that of the business men and better-placed\nhandicraftsmen, twenty-two years; and that of the operatives,\nday-labourers, and serviceable class in general, but fifteen years.  The\nParliamentary reports contain a mass of similar facts.\n\nThe death-rate is kept so high chiefly by the heavy mortality among young\nchildren in the working-class.  The tender frame of a child is least able\nto withstand the unfavourable influences of an inferior lot in life; the\nneglect to which they are often subjected, when both parents work or one\nis dead, avenges itself promptly, and no one need wonder that in\nManchester, according to the report last quoted, more than fifty-seven\nper cent. of the children of the working-class perish before the fifth\nyear, while but twenty per cent. of the children of the higher classes,\nand not quite thirty-two per cent. of the children of all classes in the\ncountry die under five years of age. {108a}  The article of the\n_Artisan_, already several times referred to, furnishes exacter\ninformation on this point, by comparing the city death-rate in single\ndiseases of children with the country death-rate, thus demonstrating\nthat, in general, epidemics in Manchester and Liverpool are three times\nmore fatal than in country districts; that affections of the nervous\nsystem are quintupled, and stomach troubles trebled, while deaths from\naffections of the lungs in cities are to those in the country as 2.5 to\n1.  Fatal cases of smallpox, measles, scarlet fever, and whooping cough,\namong small children, are four times more frequent; those of water on the\nbrain are trebled, and convulsions ten times more frequent.  To quote\nanother acknowledged authority, I append the following table.  Out of\n10,000 persons, there die--{108b}\n\n             Under  5-19   20-39   40-59   60-69   70-79  80-89  90-99  100 x\n             5 years\nIn Rutlandshire, a\nhealthy agricultural\ndistrict     2,865   891   1,275   1,299   1,189   1,428    938  112     3\nEssex, marshy\nagricultural\ndistrict     3,159 1,110   1,526   1,413     963   1,019    630  177     3\nTown of Carlisle,\n1779-1787, before\nintroduction of\nmills        4,408   921   1,006   1,201     940     826    633  153    22\nTown of Carlisle,\nafter introduction\nof mills     4,738   930   l,201   1,134     677     727    452   80     1\nPreston, factory\ntown         4,947 1,136   1,379   1,114     553     532    298   38     3\nLeeds, factory\ntown         5,286   927   1,228   1,198     593     512    225   29     2\n\nApart from the divers diseases which are the necessary consequence of the\npresent neglect and oppression of the poorer classes, there are other\ninfluences which contribute to increase the mortality among small\nchildren.  In many families the wife, like the husband, has to work away\nfrom home, and the consequence is the total neglect of the children, who\nare either locked up or given out to be taken care of.  It is, therefore,\nnot to be wondered at if hundreds of them perish through all manner of\naccidents.  Nowhere are so many children run over, nowhere are so many\nkilled by falling, drowning, or burning, as in the great cities and towns\nof England.  Deaths from burns and scalds are especially frequent, such a\ncase occurring nearly every week during the winter months in Manchester,\nand very frequently in London, though little mention is made of them in\nthe papers.  I have at hand a copy of the _Weekly Despatch_ of December\n15th, 1844, according to which, in the week from December 1st to December\n7th inclusive, _six_ such cases occurred.  These unhappy children,\nperishing in this terrible way, are victims of our social disorder, and\nof the property-holding classes interested in maintaining and prolonging\nthis disorder.  Yet one is left in doubt whether even this terribly\ntorturing death is not a blessing for the children in rescuing them from\na long life of toil and wretchedness, rich in suffering and poor in\nenjoyment.  So far has it gone in England; and the bourgeoisie reads\nthese things every day in the newspapers and takes no further trouble in\nthe matter.  But it cannot complain if, after the official and\nnon-official testimony here cited which must be known to it, I broadly\naccuse it of social murder.  Let the ruling class see to it that these\nfrightful conditions are ameliorated, or let it surrender the\nadministration of the common interests to the labouring-class.  To the\nlatter course it is by no means inclined; for the former task, so long as\nit remains the bourgeoisie crippled by bourgeois prejudice, it has not\nthe needed power.  For if, at last, after hundreds of thousands of\nvictims have perished, it manifests some little anxiety for the future,\npassing a \"Metropolitan Buildings Act,\" under which the most unscrupulous\novercrowding of dwellings is to be, at least in some slight degree,\nrestricted; if it points with pride to measures which, far from attacking\nthe root of the evil, do not by any means meet the demands of the\ncommonest sanitary policy, it cannot thus vindicate itself from the\naccusation.  The English bourgeoisie has but one choice, either to\ncontinue its rule under the unanswerable charge of murder and in spite of\nthis charge, or to abdicate in favour of the labouring-class.  Hitherto\nit has chosen the former course.\n\nLet us turn from the physical to the mental state of the workers.  Since\nthe bourgeoisie vouchsafes them only so much of life as is absolutely\nnecessary, we need not wonder that it bestows upon them only so much\neducation as lies in the interest of the bourgeoisie; and that, in truth,\nis not much.  The means of education in England are restricted out of all\nproportion to the population.  The few day schools at the command of the\nworking-class are available only for the smallest minority, and are bad\nbesides.  The teachers, worn-out workers, and other unsuitable persons\nwho only turn to teaching in order to live, are usually without the\nindispensable elementary knowledge, without the moral discipline so\nneedful for the teacher, and relieved of all public supervision.  Here,\ntoo, free competition rules, and, as usual, the rich profit by it, and\nthe poor, for whom competition is _not_ free, who have not the knowledge\nneeded to enable them to form a correct judgment, have the evil\nconsequences to bear.  Compulsory school attendance does not exist.  In\nthe mills it is, as we shall see, purely nominal; and when in the session\nof 1843 the Ministry was disposed to make this nominal compulsion\neffective, the manufacturing bourgeoisie opposed the measure with all its\nmight, though the working-class was outspokenly in favour of compulsory\nschool attendance.  Moreover, a mass of children work the whole week\nthrough in the mills or at home, and therefore cannot attend school.  The\nevening schools, supposed to be attended by children who are employed\nduring the day, are almost abandoned or attended without benefit.  It is\nasking too much, that young workers who have been using themselves up\ntwelve hours in the day, should go to school from eight to ten at night.\nAnd those who try it usually fall asleep, as is testified by hundreds of\nwitnesses in the Children's Employment Commission's Report.  Sunday\nschools have been founded, it is true, but they, too, are most scantily\nsupplied with teachers, and can be of use to those only who have already\nlearnt something in the day schools.  The interval from one Sunday to the\nnext is too long for an ignorant child to remember in the second sitting\nwhat it learned in the first, a week before.  The Children's Employment\nCommission's Report furnishes a hundred proofs, and the Commission itself\nmost emphatically expresses the opinion, that neither the week-day nor\nthe Sunday schools, in the least degree, meet the needs of the nation.\nThis report gives evidence of ignorance in the working-class of England,\nsuch as could hardly be expected in Spain or Italy.  It cannot be\notherwise; the bourgeoisie has little to hope, and much to fear, from the\neducation of the working-class.  The Ministry, in its whole enormous\nbudget of 55,000,000 pounds, has only the single trifling item of 40,000\npounds for public education, and, but for the fanaticism of the religious\nsects which does at least as much harm as good, the means of education\nwould be yet more scanty.  As it is, the State Church manages its\nnational schools and the various sects their sectarian schools for the\nsole purpose of keeping the children of the brethren of the faith within\nthe congregation, and of winning away a poor childish soul here and there\nfrom some other sect.  The consequence is that religion, and precisely\nthe most unprofitable side of religion, polemical discussion, is made the\nprincipal subject of instruction, and the memory of the children\noverburdened with incomprehensible dogmas and theological distinctions;\nthat sectarian hatred and bigotry are awakened as early as possible, and\nall rational mental and moral training shamefully neglected.  The working\nclass has repeatedly demanded of Parliament a system of strictly secular\npublic education, leaving religion to the ministers of the sects; but,\nthus far, no Ministry has been induced to grant it.  The Minister is the\nobedient servant of the bourgeoisie, and the bourgeoisie is divided into\ncountless sects; but each would gladly grant the workers the otherwise\ndangerous education on the sole condition of their accepting, as an\nantidote, the dogmas peculiar to the especial sect in question.  And as\nthese sects are still quarrelling among themselves for supremacy, the\nworkers remain for the present without education.  It is true that the\nmanufacturers boast of having enabled the majority to read, but the\nquality of the reading is appropriate to the source of the instruction,\nas the Children's Employment Commission proves.  According to this\nreport, he who knows his letters can read enough to satisfy the\nconscience of the manufacturers.  And when one reflects upon the confused\northography of the English language which makes reading one of the arts,\nlearned only under long instruction, this ignorance is readily\nunderstood.  Very few working-people write readily; and writing\northographically is beyond the powers even of many \"educated\" persons.\nThe Sunday schools of the State Church, of the Quakers, and, I think, of\nseveral other sects, do not teach writing, \"because it is too worldly an\nemployment for Sunday.\"  The quality of the instruction offered the\nworkers in other directions may be judged from a specimen or two, taken\nfrom the Children's Employment Commission's Report, which unfortunately\ndoes not embrace mill-work proper:\n\n   \"In Birmingham,\" says Commissioner Grainger, \"the children examined by\n   me are, as a whole, utterly wanting in all that could be in the\n   remotest degree called a useful education.  Although in almost all the\n   schools religious instruction alone is furnished, the profoundest\n   ignorance even upon that subject prevailed.\"--\"In Wolverhampton,\" says\n   Commissioner Horne, \"I found, among others, the following example: A\n   girl of eleven years had attended both day and Sunday school, 'had\n   never heard of another world, of Heaven, or another life.'  A boy,\n   seventeen years old, did not know that twice two are four, nor how\n   many farthings in two pence even when the money was placed in his\n   hand.  Several boys had never heard of London nor of Willenhall,\n   though the latter was but an hour's walk from their homes, and in the\n   closest relations with Wolverhampton.  Several had never heard the\n   name of the Queen nor other names, such as Nelson, Wellington,\n   Bonaparte; but it was noteworthy that those who had never heard even\n   of St. Paul, Moses, or Solomon, were very well instructed as to the\n   life, deeds, and character of Dick Turpin, and especially of Jack\n   Sheppard.  A youth of sixteen did not know how many twice two are, nor\n   how much four farthings make.  A youth of seventeen asserted that four\n   farthings are four half pence; a third, seventeen years old, answered\n   several very simple questions with the brief statement, that he 'was\n   ne jedge o' nothin'.'\" {112a}  These children who are crammed with\n   religious doctrines four or five years at a stretch, know as little at\n   the end as at the beginning.  One child \"went to Sunday school\n   regularly for five years; does not know who Jesus Christ is, but had\n   heard the name; had never heard of the twelve Apostles, Samson, Moses,\n   Aaron, etc.\" {112b}  Another \"attended Sunday school regularly six\n   years; knows who Jesus Christ was; he died on the Cross to save our\n   Saviour; had never heard of St. Peter or St. Paul.\" {113a}  A third,\n   \"attended different Sunday schools seven years; can read only the\n   thin, easy books with simple words of one syllable; has heard of the\n   Apostles, but does not know whether St. Peter was one or St. John; the\n   latter must have been St. John Wesley.\" {113b}  To the question who\n   Christ was, Horne received the following answers among others: \"He was\n   Adam,\" \"He was an Apostle,\" \"He was the Saviour's Lord's Son,\" and\n   from a youth of sixteen: \"He was a king of London long ago.\"  In\n   Sheffield, Commissioner Symonds let the children from the Sunday\n   school read aloud; they could not tell what they had read, or what\n   sort of people the Apostles were, of whom they had just been reading.\n   After he had asked them all one after the other about the Apostles\n   without securing a single correct answer, one sly-looking little\n   fellow, with great glee, called out: \"I know, mister; they were the\n   lepers!\" {113c}  From the pottery districts and from Lancashire the\n   reports are similar.\n\nThis is what the bourgeoisie and the State are doing for the education\nand improvement of the working-class.  Fortunately the conditions under\nwhich this class lives are such as give it a sort of practical training,\nwhich not only replaces school cramming, but renders harmless the\nconfused religious notions connected with it, and even places the workers\nin the vanguard of the national movement of England.  Necessity is the\nmother of invention, and what is still more important, of thought and\naction.  The English working-man who can scarcely read and still less\nwrite, nevertheless knows very well where his own interest and that of\nthe nation lies.  He knows, too, what the especial interest of the\nbourgeoisie is, and what he has to expect of that bourgeoisie.  If he\ncannot write he can speak, and speak in public; if he has no arithmetic,\nhe can, nevertheless, reckon with the Political Economists enough to see\nthrough a Corn-Law-repealing bourgeois, and to get the better of him in\nargument; if celestial matters remain very mixed for him in spite of all\nthe effort of the preachers, he sees all the more clearly into\nterrestrial, political, and social questions.  We shall have occasion to\nrefer again to this point; and pass now to the moral characteristics of\nour workers.\n\nIt is sufficiently clear that the instruction in morals can have no\nbetter effect than the religious teaching, with which in all English\nschools it is mixed up.  The simple principles which, for plain human\nbeings, regulate the relations of man to man, brought into the direst\nconfusion by our social state, our war of each against all, necessarily\nremain confused and foreign to the working-man when mixed with\nincomprehensible dogmas, and preached in the religious form of an\narbitrary and dogmatic commandment.  The schools contribute, according to\nthe confession of all authorities, and especially of the Children's\nEmployment Commission, almost nothing to the morality of the\nworking-class.  So short-sighted, so stupidly narrow-minded is the\nEnglish bourgeoisie in its egotism, that it does not even take the\ntrouble to impress upon the workers the morality of the day, which the\nbourgeoisie has patched together in its own interest for its own\nprotection!  Even this precautionary measure is too great an effort for\nthe enfeebled and sluggish bourgeoisie.  A time must come when it will\nrepent its neglect, too late.  But it has no right to complain that the\nworkers know nothing of its system of morals, and do not act in\naccordance with it.\n\nThus are the workers cast out and ignored by the class in power, morally\nas well as physically and mentally.  The only provision made for them is\nthe law, which fastens upon them when they become obnoxious to the\nbourgeoisie.  Like the dullest of the brutes, they are treated to but one\nform of education, the whip, in the shape of force, not convincing but\nintimidating.  There is, therefore, no cause for surprise if the workers,\ntreated as brutes, actually become such; or if they can maintain their\nconsciousness of manhood only by cherishing the most glowing hatred, the\nmost unbroken inward rebellion against the bourgeoisie in power.  They\nare men so long only as they burn with wrath against the reigning class.\nThey become brutes the moment they bend in patience under the yoke, and\nmerely strive to make life endurable while abandoning the effort to break\nthe yoke.\n\nThis, then, is all that the bourgeoisie has done for the education of the\nproletariat--and when we take into consideration all the circumstances in\nwhich this class lives, we shall not think the worse of it for the\nresentment which it cherishes against the ruling class.  The moral\ntraining which is not given to the worker in school is not supplied by\nthe other conditions of his life; that moral training, at least, which\nalone has worth in the eyes of the bourgeoisie; his whole position and\nenvironment involves the strongest temptation to immorality.  He is poor,\nlife offers him no charm, almost every enjoyment is denied him, the\npenalties of the law have no further terrors for him; why should he\nrestrain his desires, why leave to the rich the enjoyment of his\nbirthright, why not seize a part of it for himself?  What inducement has\nthe proletarian not to steal!  It is all very pretty and very agreeable\nto the ear of the bourgeois to hear the \"sacredness of property\"\nasserted; but for him who has none, the sacredness of property dies out\nof itself.  Money is the god of this world; the bourgeois takes the\nproletarian's money from him and so makes a practical atheist of him.  No\nwonder, then, if the proletarian retains his atheism and no longer\nrespects the sacredness and power of the earthly God.  And when the\npoverty of the proletarian is intensified to the point of actual lack of\nthe barest necessaries of life, to want and hunger, the temptation to\ndisregard all social order does but gain power.  This the bourgeoisie for\nthe most part recognises.  Symonds {115a} observes that poverty exercises\nthe same ruinous influence upon the mind which drunkenness exercises upon\nthe body; and Dr. Alison explains to property-holding readers, with the\ngreatest exactness, what the consequences of social oppression must be\nfor the working-class. {115b}  Want leaves the working-man the choice\nbetween starving slowly, killing himself speedily, or taking what he\nneeds where he finds it--in plain English, stealing.  And there is no\ncause for surprise that most of them prefer stealing to starvation and\nsuicide.\n\nTrue, there are, within the working-class, numbers too moral to steal\neven when reduced to the utmost extremity, and these starve or commit\nsuicide.  For suicide, formerly the enviable privilege of the upper\nclasses, has become fashionable among the English workers, and numbers of\nthe poor kill themselves to avoid the misery from which they see no other\nmeans of escape.\n\nBut far more demoralising than his poverty in its influence upon the\nEnglish working-man is the insecurity of his position, the necessity of\nliving upon wages from hand to mouth, that in short which makes a\nproletarian of him.  The smaller peasants in Germany are usually poor,\nand often suffer want, but they are less at the mercy of accident, they\nhave at least something secure.  The proletarian, who has nothing but his\ntwo hands, who consumes to-day what he earned yesterday, who is subject\nto every possible chance, and has not the slightest guarantee for being\nable to earn the barest necessities of life, whom every crisis, every\nwhim of his employer may deprive of bread, this proletarian is placed in\nthe most revolting, inhuman position conceivable for a human being.  The\nslave is assured of a bare livelihood by the self-interest of his master,\nthe serf has at least a scrap of land on which to live; each has at worst\na guarantee for life itself.  But the proletarian must depend upon\nhimself alone, and is yet prevented from so applying his abilities as to\nbe able to rely upon them.  Everything that the proletarian can do to\nimprove his position is but a drop in the ocean compared with the floods\nof varying chances to which he is exposed, over which he has not the\nslightest control.  He is the passive subject of all possible\ncombinations of circumstances, and must count himself fortunate when he\nhas saved his life even for a short time; and his character and way of\nliving are naturally shaped by these conditions.  Either he seeks to keep\nhis head above water in this whirlpool, to rescue his manhood, and this\nhe can do solely in rebellion {116} against the class which plunders him\nso mercilessly and then abandons him to his fate, which strives to hold\nhim in this position so demoralising to a human being; or he gives up the\nstruggle against his fate as hopeless, and strives to profit, so far as\nhe can, by the most favourable moment.  To save is unavailing, for at the\nutmost he cannot save more than suffices to sustain life for a short\ntime, while if he falls out of work, it is for no brief period.  To\naccumulate lasting property for himself is impossible; and if it were\nnot, he would only cease to be a working-man and another would take his\nplace.  What better thing can he do, then, when he gets high wages, than\nlive well upon them?  The English bourgeoisie is violently scandalised at\nthe extravagant living of the workers when wages are high; yet it is not\nonly very natural but very sensible of them to enjoy life when they can,\ninstead of laying up treasures which are of no lasting use to them, and\nwhich in the end moth and rust (_i.e_., the bourgeoisie) get possession\nof.  Yet such a life is demoralising beyond all others.  What Carlyle\nsays of the cotton spinners is true of all English industrial workers:\n{117a}\n\n   \"Their trade, now in plethoric prosperity, anon extenuated into\n   inanition and 'short time,' is of the nature of gambling; they live by\n   it like gamblers, now in luxurious superfluity, now in starvation.\n   Black, mutinous discontent devours them; simply the miserablest\n   feeling that can inhabit the heart of man.  English commerce, with its\n   world-wide, convulsive fluctuations, with its immeasurable Proteus\n   Steam demon, makes all paths uncertain for them, all life a\n   bewilderment; society, steadfastness, peaceable continuance, the first\n   blessings of man are not theirs.--This world is for them no home, but\n   a dingy prison-house, of reckless unthrift, rebellion, rancour,\n   indignation against themselves and against all men.  Is it a green,\n   flowery world, with azure everlasting sky stretched over it, the work\n   and government of a God; or a murky, simmering Tophet, of copperas\n   fumes, cotton fuz, gin riot, wrath and toil, created by a Demon,\n   governed by a Demon?\"\n\nAnd elsewhere: {117b}\n\n   \"Injustice, infidelity to truth and fact and Nature's order, being\n   properly the one evil under the sun, and the feeling of injustice the\n   one intolerable pain under the sun, our grand question as to the\n   condition of these working-men would be: Is it just?  And, first of\n   all, what belief have they themselves formed about the justice of it?\n   The words they promulgate are notable by way of answer; their actions\n   are still more notable.  Revolt, sullen, revengeful humour of revolt\n   against the upper classes, decreasing respect for what their temporal\n   superiors command, decreasing faith for what their spiritual superiors\n   teach, is more and more the universal spirit of the lower classes.\n   Such spirit may be blamed, may be vindicated, but all men must\n   recognise it as extant there, all may know that it is mournful, that\n   unless altered it will be fatal.\"\n\nCarlyle is perfectly right as to the facts and wrong only in censuring\nthe wild rage of the workers against the higher classes.  This rage, this\npassion, is rather the proof that the workers feel the inhumanity of\ntheir position, that they refuse to be degraded to the level of brutes,\nand that they will one day free themselves from servitude to the\nbourgeoisie.  This may be seen in the case of those who do not share this\nwrath; they either bow humbly before the fate that overtakes them, live a\nrespectful private life as well as they can, do not concern themselves as\nto the course of public affairs, help the bourgeoisie to forge the chains\nof the workers yet more securely, and stand upon the plane of\nintellectual nullity that prevailed before the industrial period began;\nor they are tossed about by fate, lose their moral hold upon themselves\nas they have already lost their economic hold, live along from day to\nday, drink and fall into licentiousness; and in both cases they are\nbrutes.  The last-named class contributes chiefly to the \"rapid increase\nof vice,\" at which the bourgeoisie is so horrified after itself setting\nin motion the causes which give rise to it.\n\nAnother source of demoralisation among the workers is their being\ncondemned to work.  As voluntary, productive activity is the highest\nenjoyment known to us, so is compulsory toil the most cruel, degrading\npunishment.  Nothing is more terrible than being constrained to do some\none thing every day from morning until night against one's will.  And the\nmore a man the worker feels himself, the more hateful must his work be to\nhim, because he feels the constraint, the aimlessness of it for himself.\nWhy does he work?  For love of work?  From a natural impulse?  Not at\nall!  He works for money, for a thing which has nothing whatsoever to do\nwith the work itself; and he works so long, moreover, and in such\nunbroken monotony, that this alone must make his work a torture in the\nfirst weeks if he has the least human feeling left.  The division of\nlabour has multiplied the brutalising influences of forced work.  In most\nbranches the worker's activity is reduced to some paltry, purely\nmechanical manipulation, repeated minute after minute, unchanged year\nafter year. {119}  How much human feeling, what abilities can a man\nretain in his thirtieth year, who has made needle points or filed toothed\nwheels twelve hours every day from his early childhood, living all the\ntime under the conditions forced upon the English proletarian?  It is\nstill the same thing since the introduction of steam.  The worker's\nactivity is made easy, muscular effort is saved, but the work itself\nbecomes unmeaning and monotonous to the last degree.  It offers no field\nfor mental activity, and claims just enough of his attention to keep him\nfrom thinking of anything else.  And a sentence to such work, to work\nwhich takes his whole time for itself, leaving him scarcely time to eat\nand sleep, none for physical exercise in the open air, or the enjoyment\nof Nature, much less for mental activity, how can such a sentence help\ndegrading a human being to the level of a brute?  Once more the worker\nmust choose, must either surrender himself to his fate, become a \"good\"\nworkman, heed \"faithfully\" the interest of the bourgeoisie, in which case\nhe most certainly becomes a brute, or else he must rebel, fight for his\nmanhood to the last, and this he can only do in the fight against the\nbourgeoisie.\n\nAnd when all these conditions have engendered vast demoralisation among\nthe workers, a new influence is added to the old, to spread this\ndegradation more widely and carry it to the extremest point.  This\ninfluence is the centralisation of the population.  The writers of the\nEnglish bourgeoisie are crying murder at the demoralising tendency of the\ngreat cities, like perverted Jeremiahs, they sing dirges, not over the\ndestruction, but the growth of the cities.  Sheriff Alison attributes\nalmost everything, and Dr. Vaughan, author of \"The Age of Great Cities,\"\nstill more to this influence.  And this is natural, for the propertied\nclass has too direct an interest in the other conditions which tend to\ndestroy the worker body and soul.  If they should admit that \"poverty,\ninsecurity, overwork, forced work, are the chief ruinous influences,\"\nthey would have to draw the conclusion, \"then let us give the poor\nproperty, guarantee their subsistence, make laws against overwork,\" and\nthis the bourgeoisie dare not formulate.  But the great cities have grown\nup so spontaneously, the population has moved into them so wholly of its\nown motion, and the inference that manufacture and the middle-class which\nprofits from it alone have created the cities is so remote, that it is\nextremely convenient for the ruling class to ascribe all the evil to this\napparently unavoidable source; whereas the great cities really only\nsecure a more rapid and certain development for evils already existing in\nthe germ.  Alison is humane enough to admit this; he is no thoroughbred\nLiberal manufacturer, but only a half developed Tory bourgeois, and he\nhas, therefore, an open eye, now and then, where the full-fledged\nbourgeois is still stone blind.  Let us hear him: {120}\n\n   \"It is in the great cities that vice has spread her temptations, and\n   pleasure her seductions, and folly her allurements; that guilt is\n   encouraged by the hope of impunity, and idleness fostered by the\n   frequency of example.  It is to these great marts of human corruption\n   that the base and the profligate resort from the simplicity of country\n   life; it is here that they find victims whereon to practise their\n   iniquity, and gains to reward the dangers that attend them.  Virtue is\n   here depressed from the obscurity in which it is involved.  Guilt is\n   matured from the difficulty of its detection; licentiousness is\n   rewarded by the immediate enjoyment which it promises.  If any person\n   will walk through St. Giles's, the crowded alleys of Dublin, or the\n   poorer quarters of Glasgow by night, he will meet with ample proof of\n   these observations; he will no longer wonder at the disorderly habits\n   and profligate enjoyments of the lower orders; his astonishment will\n   be, not that there is so much, but that there is so little crime in\n   the world.  The great cause of human corruption in these crowded\n   situations is the contagious nature of bad example and the extreme\n   difficulty of avoiding the seductions of vice when they are brought\n   into close and daily proximity with the younger part of the people.\n   Whatever we may think of the strength of virtue, experience proves\n   that the higher orders are indebted for their exemption from atrocious\n   crime or disorderly habits chiefly to their fortunate removal from the\n   scene of temptation; and that where they are exposed to the seductions\n   which assail their inferiors, they are noways behind them in yielding\n   to their influence.  It is the peculiar misfortune of the poor in\n   great cities that they cannot fly from these irresistible temptations,\n   but that, turn where they will, they are met by the alluring forms of\n   vice, or the seductions of guilty enjoyment.  It is the experienced\n   impossibility of concealing the attractions of vice from the younger\n   part of the poor in great cities which exposes them to so many causes\n   of demoralisation.  All this proceeds not from any unwonted or\n   extraordinary depravity in the character of these victims of\n   licentiousness, but from the almost irresistible nature of the\n   temptations to which the poor are exposed.  The rich, who censure\n   their conduct, would in all probability yield as rapidly as they have\n   done to the influence of similar causes.  There is a certain degree of\n   misery, a certain proximity to sin, which virtue is rarely able to\n   withstand, and which the young, in particular, are generally unable to\n   resist.  The progress of vice in such circumstances is almost as\n   certain and often nearly as rapid as that of physical contagion.\"\n\nAnd elsewhere:\n\n   \"When the higher orders for their own profit have drawn the labouring-\n   classes in great numbers into a small space, the contagion of guilt\n   becomes rapid and unavoidable.  The lower orders, situated as they are\n   in so far as regards moral or religious instruction, are frequently\n   hardly more to be blamed for yielding to the temptations which\n   surround them than for falling victims to the typhus fever.\"\n\nEnough!  The half-bourgeois Alison betrays to us, however narrow his\nmanner of expressing himself, the evil effect of the great cities upon\nthe moral development of the workers.  Another, a bourgeois _pur sang_, a\nman after the heart of the Anti-Corn Law League, Dr. Andrew Ure, {122}\nbetrays the other side.  He tells us that life in great cities\nfacilitates cabals among the workers and confers power on the Plebs.  If\nhere the workers are not educated (_i.e_., to obedience to the\nbourgeoisie), they may view matters one-sidedly, from the standpoint of a\nsinister selfishness, and may readily permit themselves to be hoodwinked\nby sly demagogues; nay, they might even be capable of viewing their\ngreatest benefactors, the frugal and enterprising capitalists, with a\njealous and hostile eye.  Here proper training alone can avail, or\nnational bankruptcy and other horrors must follow, since a revolution of\nthe workers could hardly fail to occur.  And our bourgeois is perfectly\njustified in his fears.  If the centralisation of population stimulates\nand develops the property-holding class, it forces the development of the\nworkers yet more rapidly.  The workers begin to feel as a class, as a\nwhole; they begin to perceive that, though feeble as individuals, they\nform a power united; their separation from the bourgeoisie, the\ndevelopment of views peculiar to the workers and corresponding to their\nposition in life, is fostered, the consciousness of oppression awakens,\nand the workers attain social and political importance.  The great cities\nare the birthplaces of labour movements; in them the workers first began\nto reflect upon their own condition, and to struggle against it; in them\nthe opposition between proletariat and bourgeoisie first made itself\nmanifest; from them proceeded the Trades-Unions, Chartism, and Socialism.\nThe great cities have transformed the disease of the social body, which\nappears in chronic form in the country, into an acute one, and so made\nmanifest its real nature and the means of curing it.  Without the great\ncities and their forcing influence upon the popular intelligence, the\nworking-class would be far less advanced than it is.  Moreover, they have\ndestroyed the last remnant of the patriarchal relation between working-\nmen and employers, a result to which manufacture on a large scale has\ncontributed by multiplying the employes dependent upon a single employer.\nThe bourgeoisie deplores all this, it is true, and has good reason to do\nso; for, under the old conditions, the bourgeois was comparatively secure\nagainst a revolt on the part of his hands.  He could tyrannise over them\nand plunder them to his heart's content, and yet receive obedience,\ngratitude, and assent from these stupid people by bestowing a trifle of\npatronising friendliness which cost him nothing, and perhaps some paltry\npresent, all apparently out of pure, self-sacrificing, uncalled-for\ngoodness of heart, but really not one-tenth part of his duty.  As an\nindividual bourgeois, placed under conditions which he had not himself\ncreated, he might do his duty at least in part; but, as a member of the\nruling class, which, by the mere fact of its ruling, is responsible for\nthe condition of the whole nation, he did nothing of what his position\ninvolved.  On the contrary, he plundered the whole nation for his own\nindividual advantage.  In the patriarchal relation that hypocritically\nconcealed the slavery of the worker, the latter must have remained an\nintellectual zero, totally ignorant of his own interest, a mere private\nindividual.  Only when estranged from his employer, when convinced that\nthe sole bond between employer and employe is the bond of pecuniary\nprofit, when the sentimental bond between them, which stood not the\nslightest test, had wholly fallen away, then only did the worker begin to\nrecognise his own interests and develop independently; then only did he\ncease to be the slave of the bourgeoisie in his thoughts, feelings, and\nthe expression of his will.  And to this end manufacture on a grand scale\nand in great cities has most largely contributed.\n\nAnother influence of great moment in forming the character of the English\nworkers is the Irish immigration already referred to.  On the one hand it\nhas, as we have seen, degraded the English workers, removed them from\ncivilisation, and aggravated the hardship of their lot; but, on the other\nhand, it has thereby deepened the chasm between workers and bourgeoisie,\nand hastened the approaching crisis.  For the course of the social\ndisease from which England is suffering is the same as the course of a\nphysical disease; it develops, according to certain laws, has its own\ncrisis, the last and most violent of which determines the fate of the\npatient.  And as the English nation cannot succumb under the final\ncrises, but must go forth from it, born again, rejuvenated, we can but\nrejoice over everything which accelerates the course of the disease.  And\nto this the Irish immigration further contributes by reason of the\npassionate, mercurial Irish temperament, which it imports into England\nand into the English working-class.  The Irish and English are to each\nother much as the French and the Germans; and the mixing of the more\nfacile, excitable, fiery Irish temperament with the stable, reasoning,\npersevering English must, in the long run, be productive only of good for\nboth.  The rough egotism of the English bourgeoisie would have kept its\nhold upon the working-class much more firmly if the Irish nature,\ngenerous to a fault, and ruled primarily by sentiment, had not\nintervened, and softened the cold, rational English character in part by\na mixture of the races, and in part by the ordinary contact of life.\n\nIn view of all this, it is not surprising that the working-class has\ngradually become a race wholly apart from the English bourgeoisie.  The\nbourgeoisie has more in common with every other nation of the earth than\nwith the workers in whose midst it lives.  The workers speak other\ndialects, have other thoughts and ideals, other customs and moral\nprinciples, a different religion and other politics than those of the\nbourgeoisie.  Thus they are two radically dissimilar nations, as unlike\nas difference of race could make them, of whom we on the Continent have\nknown but one, the bourgeoisie.  Yet it is precisely the other, the\npeople, the proletariat, which is by far the more important for the\nfuture of England.\n\nOf the public character of the English working-man, as it finds\nexpression in associations and political principles, we shall have\noccasion to speak later; let us here consider the results of the\ninfluences cited above, as they affect the private character of the\nworker.  The workman is far more humane in ordinary life than the\nbourgeois.  I have already mentioned the fact that the beggars are\naccustomed to turn almost exclusively to the workers, and that, in\ngeneral, more is done by the workers than by the bourgeoisie for the\nmaintenance of the poor.  This fact, which any one may prove for himself\nany day, is confirmed, among others, by Dr. Parkinson, Canon of\nManchester, who says: {125}\n\n   \"The poor give one another more than the rich give the poor.  I can\n   confirm my statement by the testimony of one of our eldest, most\n   skilful, most observant, and humane physicians, Dr. Bardsley, who has\n   often declared that the total sum which the poor yearly bestow upon\n   one another, surpasses that which the rich contribute in the same\n   time.\"\n\nIn other ways, too, the humanity of the workers is constantly manifesting\nitself pleasantly.  They have experienced hard times themselves, and can\ntherefore feel for those in trouble, whence they are more approachable,\nfriendlier, and less greedy for money, though they need it far more, than\nthe property-holding class.  For them money is worth only what it will\nbuy, whereas for the bourgeois it has an especial inherent value, the\nvalue of a god, and makes the bourgeois the mean, low money-grabber that\nhe is.  The working-man who knows nothing of this feeling of reverence\nfor money is therefore less grasping than the bourgeois, whose whole\nactivity is for the purpose of gain, who sees in the accumulations of his\nmoney-bags the end and aim of life.  Hence the workman is much less\nprejudiced, has a clearer eye for facts as they are than the bourgeois,\nand does not look at everything through the spectacles of personal\nselfishness.  His faulty education saves him from religious\nprepossessions, he does not understand religious questions, does not\ntrouble himself about them, knows nothing of the fanaticism that holds\nthe bourgeoisie bound; and if he chances to have any religion, he has it\nonly in name, not even in theory.  Practically he lives for this world,\nand strives to make himself at home in it.  All the writers of the\nbourgeoisie are unanimous on this point, that the workers are not\nreligious, and do not attend church.  From the general statement are to\nbe excepted the Irish, a few elderly people, and the half-bourgeois, the\noverlookers, foremen, and the like.  But among the masses there prevails\nalmost universally a total indifference to religion, or at the utmost,\nsome trace of Deism too undeveloped to amount to more than mere words, or\na vague dread of the words infidel, atheist, etc.  The clergy of all\nsects is in very bad odour with the working-men, though the loss of its\ninfluence is recent.  At present, however, the mere cry: \"He's a parson!\"\nis often enough to drive one of the clergy from the platform of a public\nmeeting.  And like the rest of the conditions under which he lives, his\nwant of religious and other culture contributes to keep the working-man\nmore unconstrained, freer from inherited stable tenets and cut-and-dried\nopinions, than the bourgeois who is saturated with the class prejudices\npoured into him from his earliest youth.  There is nothing to be done\nwith the bourgeois; he is essentially conservative in however liberal a\nguise, his interest is bound up with that of the property-holding class,\nhe is dead to all active movement; he is losing his position in the\nforefront of England's historical development.  The workers are taking\nhis place, in rightful claim first, then in fact.\n\nAll this, together with the correspondent public action of the workers,\nwith which we shall deal later, forms the favourable side of the\ncharacter of this class; the unfavourable one may be quite as briefly\nsummed up, and follows quite as naturally out of the given causes.\nDrunkenness, sexual irregularities, brutality, and disregard for the\nrights of property are the chief points with which the bourgeois charges\nthem.  That they drink heavily is to be expected.  Sheriff Alison asserts\nthat in Glasgow some thirty thousand working-men get drunk every Saturday\nnight, and the estimate is certainly not exaggerated; and that in that\ncity in 1830, one house in twelve, and in 1840, one house in ten, was a\npublic-house; that in Scotland, in 1823, excise was paid upon 2,300,000\ngallons; in 1837, upon 6,620,000 gallons; in England, in 1823, upon\n1,976,000 gallons, and in 1837, upon 7,875,000 gallons of spirits.  The\nBeer Act of 1830, which facilitated the opening of beerhouses (jerry\nshops), whose keepers are licensed to sell beer to be drunk on the\npremises, facilitated the spread of intemperance by bringing a beerhouse,\nso to say, to everybody's door.  In nearly every street there are several\nsuch beerhouses, and among two or three neighbouring houses in the\ncountry one is sure to be a jerry shop.  Besides these, there are hush-\nshops in multitudes, _i.e_., secret drinking-places which are not\nlicensed, and quite as many secret distilleries which produce great\nquantities of spirits in retired spots, rarely visited by the police, in\nthe great cities.  Gaskell estimates these secret distilleries in\nManchester alone at more than a hundred, and their product at 156,000\ngallons at the least.  In Manchester there are, besides, more than a\nthousand public-houses selling all sorts of alcoholic drinks, or quite as\nmany in proportion to the number of inhabitants as in Glasgow.  In all\nother great towns, the state of things is the same.  And when one\nconsiders, apart from the usual consequences of intemperance, that men\nand women, even children, often mothers with babies in their arms, come\ninto contact in these places with the most degraded victims of the\nbourgeois regime, with thieves, swindlers, and prostitutes; when one\nreflects that many a mother gives the baby on her arm gin to drink, the\ndemoralising effects of frequenting such places cannot be denied.\n\nOn Saturday evenings, especially when wages are paid and work stops\nsomewhat earlier than usual, when the whole working-class pours from its\nown poor quarters into the main thoroughfares, intemperance may be seen\nin all its brutality.  I have rarely come out of Manchester on such an\nevening without meeting numbers of people staggering and seeing others\nlying in the gutter.  On Sunday evening the same scene is usually\nrepeated, only less noisily.  And when their money is spent, the\ndrunkards go to the nearest pawnshop, of which there are plenty in every\ncity--over sixty in Manchester, and ten or twelve in a single street of\nSalford, Chapel Street--and pawn whatever they possess.  Furniture,\nSunday clothes where such exist, kitchen utensils in masses are fetched\nfrom the pawnbrokers on Saturday night only to wander back, almost\nwithout fail, before the next Wednesday, until at last some accident\nmakes the final redemption impossible, and one article after another\nfalls into the clutches of the usurer, or until he refuses to give a\nsingle farthing more upon the battered, used-up pledge.  When one has\nseen the extent of intemperance among the workers in England, one readily\nbelieves Lord Ashley's statement that this class annually expends\nsomething like twenty-five million pounds sterling upon intoxicating\nliquor: and the deterioration in external conditions, the frightful\nshattering of mental and physical health, the ruin of all domestic\nrelations which follow may readily be imagined.  True, the temperance\nsocieties have done much, but what are a few thousand teetotallers among\nthe millions of workers?  When Father Matthew, the Irish apostle of\ntemperance, passes through the English cities, from thirty to sixty\nthousand workers take the pledge; but most of them break it again within\na month.  If one counts up the immense numbers who have taken the pledge\nin the last three or four years in Manchester, the total is greater than\nthe whole population of the town--and still it is by no means evident\nthat intemperance is diminishing.\n\nNext to intemperance in the enjoyment of intoxicating liquors, one of the\nprincipal faults of English working-men is sexual licence.  But this,\ntoo, follows with relentless logic, with inevitable necessity out of the\nposition of a class left to itself, with no means of making fitting use\nof its freedom.  The bourgeoisie has left the working-class only these\ntwo pleasures, while imposing upon it a multitude of labours and\nhardships, and the consequence is that the working-men, in order to get\nsomething from life, concentrate their whole energy upon these two\nenjoyments, carry them to excess, surrender to them in the most unbridled\nmanner.  When people are placed under conditions which appeal to the\nbrute only, what remains to them but to rebel or to succumb to utter\nbrutality?  And when, moreover, the bourgeoisie does its full share in\nmaintaining prostitution--and how many of the 40,000 prostitutes who fill\nthe streets of London every evening live upon the virtuous bourgeoisie!\nHow many of them owe it to the seduction of a bourgeois, that they must\noffer their bodies to the passers-by in order to live?--surely it has\nleast of all a right to reproach the workers with their sexual brutality.\n\nThe failings of the workers in general may be traced to an unbridled\nthirst for pleasure, to want of providence, and of flexibility in fitting\ninto the social order, to the general inability to sacrifice the pleasure\nof the moment to a remoter advantage.  But is that to be wondered at?\nWhen a class can purchase few and only the most sensual pleasures by its\nwearying toil, must it not give itself over blindly and madly to those\npleasures?  A class about whose education no one troubles himself, which\nis a playball to a thousand chances, knows no security in life--what\nincentives has such a class to providence, to \"respectability,\" to\nsacrifice the pleasure of the moment for a remoter enjoyment, most\nuncertain precisely by reason of the perpetually varying, shifting\nconditions under which the proletariat lives?  A class which bears all\nthe disadvantages of the social order without enjoying its advantages,\none to which the social system appears in purely hostile aspects--who can\ndemand that such a class respect this social order?  Verily that is\nasking much!  But the working-man cannot escape the present arrangement\nof society so long as it exists, and when the individual worker resists\nit, the greatest injury falls upon himself.\n\nThus the social order makes family life almost impossible for the worker.\nIn a comfortless, filthy house, hardly good enough for mere nightly\nshelter, ill-furnished, often neither rain-tight nor warm, a foul\natmosphere filling rooms overcrowded with human beings, no domestic\ncomfort is possible.  The husband works the whole day through, perhaps\nthe wife also and the elder children, all in different places; they meet\nnight and morning only, all under perpetual temptation to drink; what\nfamily life is possible under such conditions?  Yet the working-man\ncannot escape from the family, must live in the family, and the\nconsequence is a perpetual succession of family troubles, domestic\nquarrels, most demoralising for parents and children alike.  Neglect of\nall domestic duties, neglect of the children, especially, is only too\ncommon among the English working-people, and only too vigorously fostered\nby the existing institutions of society.  And children growing up in this\nsavage way, amidst these demoralising influences, are expected to turn\nout goody-goody and moral in the end!  Verily the requirements are naive,\nwhich the self-satisfied bourgeois makes upon the working-man!\n\nThe contempt for the existing social order is most conspicuous in its\nextreme form--that of offences against the law.  If the influences\ndemoralising to the working-man act more powerfully, more concentratedly\nthan usual, he becomes an offender as certainly as water abandons the\nfluid for the vaporous state at 80 degrees, Reaumur.  Under the brutal\nand brutalising treatment of the bourgeoisie, the working-man becomes\nprecisely as much a thing without volition as water, and is subject to\nthe laws of nature with precisely the same necessity; at a certain point\nall freedom ceases.  Hence with the extension of the proletariat, crime\nhas increased in England, and the British nation has become the most\ncriminal in the world.  From the annual criminal tables of the Home\nSecretary, it is evident that the increase of crime in England has\nproceeded with incomprehensible rapidity.  The numbers of arrests for\n_criminal_ offences reached in the years: 1805, 4,605; 1810, 5,146; 1815,\n7,898; 1820, 13,710; 1825, 14,437; 1830,18,107; 1835, 20,731; 1840,\n27,187; 1841, 27,760; 1842, 31,309 in England and Wales alone.  That is\nto say, they increased sevenfold in thirty-seven years.  Of these\narrests, in 1842, 4,497 were made in Lancashire alone, or more than 14\nper cent. of the whole; and 4,094 in Middlesex, including London, or more\nthan 13 per cent.  So that two districts which include great cities with\nlarge proletarian populations, produced one-fourth of the total amount of\ncrime, though their population is far from forming one-fourth of the\nwhole.  Moreover, the criminal tables prove directly that nearly all\ncrime arises within the proletariat; for, in 1842, taking the average,\nout of 100 criminals, 32.35 could neither read nor write; 58.32 read and\nwrote imperfectly; 6.77 could read and write well; 0.22 had enjoyed a\nhigher education, while the degree of education of 2.34 could not be\nascertained.  In Scotland, crime has increased yet more rapidly.  There\nwere but 89 arrests for criminal offences in 1819, and as early as 1837\nthe number had risen to 3,176, and in 1842 to 4,189.  In Lanarkshire,\nwhere Sheriff Alison himself made out the official report, population has\ndoubled once in thirty years, and crime once in five and a half, or six\ntimes more rapidly than the population.  The offences, as in all\ncivilised countries, are, in the great majority of cases, against\nproperty, and have, therefore, arisen from want in some form; for what a\nman has, he does not steal.  The proportion of offences against property\nto the population, which in the Netherlands is as 1: 7,140, and in\nFrance, as 1: 1,804, was in England, when Gaskell wrote, as 1: 799.  The\nproportion of offences against persons to the population is, in the\nNetherlands, 1: 28,904; in France, 1: 17,573; in England, 1: 23,395; that\nof crimes in general to the population in the agricultural districts, as\n1: 1,043; in the manufacturing districts as 1: 840. {131a}  In the whole\nof England to-day the proportion is 1: 660; {131b} though it is scarcely\nten years since Gaskell's book appeared!\n\nThese facts are certainly more than sufficient to bring any one, even a\nbourgeois, to pause and reflect upon the consequences of such a state of\nthings.  If demoralisation and crime multiply twenty years longer in this\nproportion (and if English manufacture in these twenty years should be\nless prosperous than heretofore, the progressive multiplication of crime\ncan only continue the more rapidly), what will the result be?  Society is\nalready in a state of visible dissolution; it is impossible to pick up a\nnewspaper without seeing the most striking evidence of the giving way of\nall social ties.  I look at random into a heap of English journals lying\nbefore me; there is the _Manchester Guardian_ for October 30, 1844, which\nreports for three days.  It no longer takes the trouble to give exact\ndetails as to Manchester, and merely relates the most interesting cases:\nthat the workers in a mill have struck for higher wages without giving\nnotice, and been condemned by a Justice of the Peace to resume work; that\nin Salford a couple of boys had been caught stealing, and a bankrupt\ntradesman tried to cheat his creditors.  From the neighbouring towns the\nreports are more detailed: in Ashton, two thefts, one burglary, one\nsuicide; in Bury, one theft; in Bolton, two thefts, one revenue fraud; in\nLeigh, one theft; in Oldham, one strike for wages, one theft, one fight\nbetween Irish women, one non-Union hatter assaulted by Union men, one\nmother beaten by her son, one attack upon the police, one robbery of a\nchurch; in Stockport, discontent of working-men with wages, one theft,\none fraud, one fight, one wife beaten by her husband; in Warrington, one\ntheft, one fight; in Wigan, one theft, and one robbery of a church.  The\nreports of the London papers are much worse; frauds, thefts, assaults,\nfamily quarrels crowd one another.  A _Times_ of September 12, 1844,\nfalls into my hand, which gives a report of a single day, including a\ntheft, an attack upon the police, a sentence upon a father requiring him\nto support his illegitimate son, the abandonment of a child by its\nparents, and the poisoning of a man by his wife.  Similar reports are to\nbe found in all the English papers.  In this country, social war is under\nfull headway, every one stands for himself, and fights for himself\nagainst all comers, and whether or not he shall injure all the others who\nare his declared foes, depends upon a cynical calculation as to what is\nmost advantageous for himself.  It no longer occurs to any one to come to\na peaceful understanding with his fellow-man; all differences are settled\nby threats, violence, or in a law-court.  In short, every one sees in his\nneighbour an enemy to be got out of the way, or, at best, a tool to be\nused for his own advantage.  And this war grows from year to year, as the\ncriminal tables show, more violent, passionate, irreconcilable.  The\nenemies are dividing gradually into two great camps--the bourgeoisie on\nthe one hand, the workers on the other.  This war of each against all, of\nthe bourgeoisie against the proletariat, need cause us no surprise, for\nit is only the logical sequel of the principle involved in free\ncompetition.  But it may very well surprise us that the bourgeoisie\nremains so quiet and composed in the face of the rapidly gathering storm-\nclouds, that it can read all these things daily in the papers without, we\nwill not say indignation at such a social condition, but fear of its\nconsequences, of a universal outburst of that which manifests itself\nsymptomatically from day to day in the form of crime.  But then it is the\nbourgeoisie, and from its standpoint cannot even see the facts, much less\nperceive their consequences.  One thing only is astounding, that class\nprejudice and preconceived opinions can hold a whole class of human\nbeings in such perfect, I might almost say, such mad blindness.\nMeanwhile, the development of the nation goes its way whether the\nbourgeoisie has eyes for it or not, and will surprise the\nproperty-holding class one day with things not dreamed of in its\nphilosophy.\n\n\n\n\nSINGLE BRANCHES OF INDUSTRY.  FACTORY HANDS.\n\n\nIn dealing now with the more important branches of the English\nmanufacturing proletariat, we shall begin, according to the principle\nalready laid down, with the factory-workers, _i.e_., those who are\ncomprised under the Factory Act.  This law regulates the length of the\nworking-day in mills in which wool, silk, cotton, and flax are spun or\nwoven by means of water or steam-power, and embraces, therefore, the more\nimportant branches of English manufacture.  The class employed by them is\nthe most intelligent and energetic of all the English workers, and,\ntherefore, the most restless and most hated by the bourgeoisie.  It\nstands as a whole, and the cotton-workers pre-eminently stand, at the\nhead of the labour movement, as their masters the manufacturers,\nespecially those of Lancashire, take the lead of the bourgeois agitation.\n\nWe have already seen in the introduction how the population employed in\nworking up the textile materials were first torn from their former way of\nlife.  It is, therefore, not surprising that the progress of mechanical\ninvention in later years also affected precisely these workers most\ndeeply and permanently.  The history of cotton manufacture as related by\nUre, {134a} Baines, {134b} and others is the story of improvements in\nevery direction, most of which have become domesticated in the other\nbranches of industry as well.  Hand-work is superseded by machine-work\nalmost universally, nearly all manipulations are conducted by the aid of\nsteam or water, and every year is bringing further improvements.\n\nIn a well-ordered state of society, such improvements could only be a\nsource of rejoicing; in a war of all against all, individuals seize the\nbenefit for themselves, and so deprive the majority of the means of\nsubsistence.  Every improvement in machinery throws workers out of\nemployment, and the greater the advance, the more numerous the\nunemployed; each great improvement produces, therefore, upon a number of\nworkers the effect of a commercial crisis, creates want, wretchedness,\nand crime.  Take a few examples.  The very first invention, the jenny,\nworked by one man, produced at least sixfold what the spinning-wheel had\nyielded in the same time; thus every new jenny threw five spinners out of\nemployment.  The throstle, which, in turn, produced much more than the\njenny, and like it, was worked by one man, threw still more people out of\nemployment.  The mule, which required yet fewer hands in proportion to\nthe product, had the same effect, and every improvement in the mule,\nevery multiplication of its spindles, diminished still further the number\nof workers employed.  But this increase of the number of spindles in the\nmule is so great that whole armies of workers have been thrown out of\nemployment by it.  For, whereas one spinner, with a couple of children\nfor piecers, formerly set six hundred spindles in motion, he could now\nmanage fourteen hundred to two thousand spindles upon two mules, so that\ntwo adult spinners and a part of the piecers whom they employed were\nthrown out.  And since self-acting mules have been introduced into a very\nlarge number of spinning-mills, the spinners' work is wholly performed by\nthe machine.  There lies before me a book from the pen of James Leach,\n{135} one of the recognised leaders of the Chartists in Manchester.  The\nauthor has worked for years in various branches of industry, in mills and\ncoal mines, and is known to me personally as an honest, trustworthy, and\ncapable man.  In consequence of his political position, he had at command\nextensive detailed information as to the different factories, collected\nby the workers themselves, and he publishes tables from which it is clear\nthat in 1841, in 35 factories, 1,060 fewer mule spinners were employed\nthan in 1829, though the number of spindles in these 35 factories had\nincreased by 99,239.  He cites five factories in which no spinners\nwhatever are employed, self-actors only being used.  While the number of\nspindles increased by 10 per cent., the number of spinners diminished\nmore than 60 per cent.  And Leach adds that since 1841, so many\nimprovements have been introduced by double-decking and other means, that\nin some of the factories named, half the operatives have been discharged.\nIn one factory alone, where eighty spinners were employed a short time\nago, there are now but twenty left; the others having been discharged or\nset at children's work for children's wages.  Of Stockport Leach tells a\nsimilar story, that in 1835, 800 spinners were employed, and in 1840 but\n140, though the manufacture of Stockport has greatly increased during the\nlast eight or nine years.  Similar improvements have now been made in\ncarding frames, by which one-half the operatives have been thrown out of\nemployment.  In one factory improved frames have been set up, which have\nthrown four hands out of eight out of work, besides which the employer\nreduced the wages of the four retained from eight shillings to seven.  The\nsame process has gone on in the weaving industry; the power-loom has\ntaken possession of one branch of hand-weaving after another, and since\nit produces much more than the hand-loom, while one weaver can work two\nlooms, it has superseded a multitude of working-people.  And in all sorts\nof manufacture, in flax and wool-spinning, in silk-twisting, the case is\nthe same.  The power-loom, too, is beginning to appropriate one branch\nafter another of wool and linen-weaving; in Rochdale alone, there are\nmore power than hand-looms in flannel and other wool-weaving branches.\nThe bourgeoisie usually replies to this, that improvements in machinery,\nby decreasing the cost of production, supply finished goods at lower\nprices, and that these reduced prices cause such an increase in\nconsumption that the unemployed operatives soon find full employment in\nnewly-founded factories. {136}  The bourgeoisie is so far correct that\nunder certain conditions favourable for the general development of\nmanufacture, every reduction in price of goods _in which the raw material\nis cheap_, greatly increases consumption, and gives rise to the building\nof new factories; but every further word of the assertion is a lie.  The\nbourgeoisie ignores the fact that it takes years for these results of the\ndecrease in price to follow and for new factories to be built; it is\nsilent upon the point that every improvement in machinery throws the real\nwork, the expenditure of force, more and more upon the machine, and so\ntransforms the work of full-grown men into mere supervision, which a\nfeeble woman or even a child can do quite as well, and does for half or\ntwo-thirds wages; that, therefore, grown men are constantly more and more\nsupplanted and _not re-employed_ by the increase in manufacture; it\nconceals the fact that whole branches of industry fall away, or are so\nchanged that they must be learned afresh; and it takes good care not to\nconfess what it usually harps upon, whenever the question of forbidding\nthe work of children is broached, that factory-work must be learned in\nearliest youth in order to be learned properly.  It does not mention the\nfact that the process of improvement goes steadily on, and that as soon\nas the operative has succeeded in making himself at home in a new branch,\nif he actually does succeed in so doing, this, too, is taken from him,\nand with it the last remnant of security which remained to him for\nwinning his bread.  But the bourgeoisie gets the benefit of the\nimprovements in machinery; it has a capital opportunity for piling up\nmoney during the first years while many old machines are still in use,\nand the improvement not yet universally introduced; and it would be too\nmuch to ask that it should have an open eye for the disadvantages\ninseparable from these improvements.\n\nThe fact that improved machinery reduces wages has also been as violently\ndisputed by the bourgeoisie, as it is constantly reiterated by the\nworking-men.  The bourgeoisie insists that although the price of piece-\nwork has been reduced, yet the total of wages for the week's work has\nrather risen than fallen, and the condition of the operatives rather\nimproved than deteriorated.  It is hard to get to the bottom of the\nmatter, for the operatives usually dwell upon the price of piece-work.\nBut it is certain that the weekly wage, also, has, in many branches of\nwork, been reduced by the improvement of machinery.  The so-called fine\nspinners (who spin fine mule yarn), for instance, do receive high wages,\nthirty to forty shillings a week, because they have a powerful\nassociation for keeping wages up, and their craft requires long training;\nbut the coarse spinners who have to compete against self-actors (which\nare not as yet adapted for fine spinning), and whose association was\nbroken down by the introduction of these machines, receive very low\nwages.  A mule spinner told me that he does not earn more than fourteen\nshillings a week, and his statement agrees with that of Leach, that in\nvarious factories the coarse spinners earn less than sixteen shillings\nand sixpence a week, and that a spinner, who years ago earned thirty\nshillings, can now hardly scrape up twelve and a half, and had not earned\nmore on an average in the past year.  The wages of women and children may\nperhaps have fallen less, but only because they were not high from the\nbeginning.  I know several women, widows with children, who have trouble\nenough to earn eight to nine shillings a week; and that they and their\nfamilies cannot live decently upon that sum, every one must admit who\nknows the price of the barest necessaries of life in England.  That wages\nin general have been reduced by the improvement of machinery is the\nunanimous testimony of the operatives.  The bourgeois assertion that the\ncondition of the working-class has been improved by machinery is most\nvigorously proclaimed a falsehood in every meeting of working-men in the\nfactory districts.  And even if it were true that the relative wage, the\nprice of piece-work only, has fallen, while the absolute wage, the sum to\nbe earned in the week, remained unchanged, what would follow?  That the\noperatives have had quietly to look on while the manufacturers filled\ntheir purses from every improvement without giving the hands the smallest\nshare in the gain.  The bourgeois forgets, in fighting the working-man,\nthe most ordinary principles of his own Political Economy.  He who at\nother times swears by Malthus, cries out in his anxiety before the\nworkers: \"Where could the millions by which the population of England has\nincreased find work, without the improvements in machinery?\" {138}  As\nthough the bourgeois did not know well enough that without machinery and\nthe expansion of industry which it produced, these \"millions\" would never\nhave been brought into the world and grown up!  The service which\nmachinery has rendered the workers is simply this: that it has brought\nhome to their minds the necessity of a social reform by means of which\nmachinery shall no longer work against but for them.  Let the wise\nbourgeois ask the people who sweep the streets in Manchester and\nelsewhere (though even this is past now, since machines for the purpose\nhave been invented and introduced), or sell salt, matches, oranges, and\nshoe-strings on the streets, or even beg, what they were formerly, and he\nwill see how many will answer: \"Mill-hands thrown out of work by\nmachinery.\"  The consequences of improvement in machinery under our\npresent social conditions are, for the working-man, solely injurious, and\noften in the highest degree oppressive.  Every new advance brings with it\nloss of employment, want, and suffering, and in a country like England\nwhere, without that, there is usually a \"surplus population,\" to be\ndischarged from work is the worst that can befall the operative.  And\nwhat a dispiriting, unnerving influence this uncertainty of his position\nin life, consequent upon the unceasing progress of machinery, must\nexercise upon the worker, whose lot is precarious enough without it!  To\nescape despair, there are but two ways open to him; either inward and\noutward revolt against the bourgeoisie or drunkenness and general\ndemoralisation.  And the English operatives are accustomed to take refuge\nin both.  The history of the English proletariat relates hundreds of\nuprisings against machinery and the bourgeoisie; we have already spoken\nof the moral dissolution which, in itself, is only another form of\ndespair.\n\nThe worst situation is that of those workers who have to compete against\na machine that is making its way.  The price of the goods which they\nproduce adapts itself to the price of the kindred product of the machine,\nand as the latter works more cheaply, its human competitor has but the\nlowest wages.  The same thing happens to every operative employed upon an\nold machine in competition with later improvements.  And who else is\nthere to bear the hardship?  The manufacturer will not throw out his old\napparatus, nor will he sustain the loss upon it; out of the dead\nmechanism he can make nothing, so he fastens upon the living worker, the\nuniversal scapegoat of society.  Of all the workers in competition with\nmachinery, the most ill-used are the hand-loom cotton weavers.  They\nreceive the most trifling wages, and, with full work, are not in a\nposition to earn more than ten shillings a week.  One class of woven\ngoods after another is annexed by the power-loom, and hand-weaving is the\nlast refuge of workers thrown out of employment in other branches, so\nthat the trade is always overcrowded.  Hence it comes that, in average\nseasons, the hand-weaver counts himself fortunate if he can earn six or\nseven shillings a week, while to reach this sum he must sit at his loom\nfourteen to eighteen hours a day.  Most woven goods require moreover a\ndamp weaving-room, to keep the weft from snapping, and in part, for this\nreason, in part because of their poverty, which prevents them from paying\nfor better dwellings, the workrooms of these weavers are usually without\nwooden or paved floors.  I have been in many dwellings of such weavers,\nin remote, vile courts and alleys, usually in cellars.  Often\nhalf-a-dozen of these hand-loom weavers, several of them married, live\ntogether in a cottage with one or two workrooms, and one large sleeping-\nroom.  Their food consists almost exclusively of potatoes, with perhaps\noatmeal porridge, rarely milk, and scarcely ever meat.  Great numbers of\nthem are Irish or of Irish descent.  And these poor hand-loom weavers,\nfirst to suffer from every crisis, and last to be relieved from it, must\nserve the bourgeoisie as a handle in meeting attacks upon the factory\nsystem.  \"See,\" cries the bourgeois, triumphantly, \"see how these poor\ncreatures must famish, while the mill operatives are thriving, and _then_\njudge the factory {140} system!\"  As though it were not precisely the\nfactory system and the machinery belonging to it which had so shamefully\ncrushed the hand-loom weavers, and as though the bourgeoisie did not know\nthis quite as well as ourselves!  But the bourgeoisie has interests at\nstake, and so a falsehood or two and a bit of hypocrisy won't matter\nmuch.\n\nLet us examine somewhat more closely the fact that machinery more and\nmore supersedes the work of men.  The human labour, involved in both\nspinning and weaving, consists chiefly in piecing broken threads, as the\nmachine does all the rest.  This work requires no muscular strength, but\nonly flexibility of finger.  Men are, therefore, not only not needed for\nit, but actually, by reason of the greater muscular development of the\nhand, less fit for it than women and children, and are, therefore,\nnaturally almost superseded by them.  Hence, the more the use of the\narms, the expenditure of strength, can be transferred to steam or water-\npower, the fewer men need be employed; and as women and children work\nmore cheaply, and in these branches better than men, they take their\nplaces.  In the spinning-mills women and girls are to be found in almost\nexclusive possession of the throstles; among the mules one man, an adult\nspinner (with self-actors, he, too, becomes superfluous), and several\npiecers for tying the threads, usually children or women, sometimes young\nmen of from eighteen to twenty years, here and there an old spinner {141}\nthrown out of other employment.  At the power-looms women, from fifteen\nto twenty years, are chiefly employed, and a few men; these, however,\nrarely remain at this trade after their twenty-first year.  Among the\npreparatory machinery, too, women alone are to be found, with here and\nthere a man to clean and sharpen the carding-frames.  Besides all these,\nthe factories employ numbers of children--doffers--for mounting and\ntaking down bobbins, and a few men as overlookers, a mechanic and an\nengineer for the steam-engines, carpenters, porters, etc.; but the actual\nwork of the mills is done by women and children.  This the manufacturers\ndeny.\n\nThey published last year elaborate tables to prove that machinery does\nnot supersede adult male operatives.  According to these tables, rather\nmore than half of all the factory-workers employed, _viz_., 52 per cent.,\nwere females and 48 per cent. males, and of those operatives more than\nhalf were over eighteen years old.  So far, so good.  But the\nmanufacturers are very careful not to tell us, how many of the adults\nwere men and how many women.  And this is just the point.  Besides this,\nthey have evidently counted the mechanics, engineers, carpenters, all the\nmen employed in any way in the factories, perhaps even the clerks, and\nstill they have not the courage to tell the whole truth.  These\npublications teem generally with falsehoods, perversions, crooked\nstatements, with calculations of averages, that prove a great deal for\nthe uninitiated reader and nothing for the initiated, and with\nsuppressions of facts bearing on the most important points; and they\nprove only the selfish blindness and want of uprightness of the\nmanufacturers concerned.  Let us take some of the statements of a speech\nwith which Lord Ashley introduced the Ten Hours' Bill, March 15th, 1844,\ninto the House of Commons.  Here he gives some data as to the relations\nof sex and age of the operatives, not yet refuted by the manufacturers,\nwhose statements, as quoted above, cover moreover only a part of the\nmanufacturing industry of England.  Of 419,560 factory operatives of the\nBritish Empire in 1839, 192,887, or nearly half, were under eighteen\nyears of age, and 242,296 of the female sex, of whom 112,192 were less\nthan eighteen years old.  There remain, therefore, 80,695 male operatives\nunder eighteen years, and 96,569 adult male operatives, _or not one full\nquarter_ of the whole number.  In the cotton factories, 56.25 per cent.;\nin the woollen mills, 69.5 per cent.; in the silk mills, 70.5 per cent.;\nin the flax-spinning mills, 70.5 per cent. of all operatives are of the\nfemale sex.  These numbers suffice to prove the crowding out of adult\nmales.  But you have only to go into the nearest mill to see the fact\nconfirmed.  Hence follows of necessity that inversion of the existing\nsocial order which, being forced upon them, has the most ruinous\nconsequences for the workers.  The employment of women at once breaks up\nthe family; for when the wife spends twelve or thirteen hours every day\nin the mill, and the husband works the same length of time there or\nelsewhere, what becomes of the children?  They grow up like wild weeds;\nthey are put out to nurse for a shilling or eighteenpence a week, and how\nthey are treated may be imagined.  Hence the accidents to which little\nchildren fall victims multiply in the factory districts to a terrible\nextent.  The lists of the Coroner of Manchester {143a} showed for nine\nmonths: 69 deaths from burning, 56 from drowning, 23 from falling, 77\nfrom other causes, or a total of 225 {143b} deaths from accidents, while\nin non-manufacturing Liverpool during twelve months there were but 146\nfatal accidents.  The mining accidents are excluded in both cases; and\nsince the Coroner of Manchester has no authority in Salford, the\npopulation of both places mentioned in the comparison is about the same.\nThe _Manchester Guardian_ reports one or more deaths by burning in almost\nevery number.  That the general mortality among young children must be\nincreased by the employment of the mothers is self-evident, and is placed\nbeyond all doubt by notorious facts.  Women often return to the mill\nthree or four days after confinement, leaving the baby, of course; in the\ndinner hour they must hurry home to feed the child and eat something, and\nwhat sort of suckling that can be is also evident.  Lord Ashley repeats\nthe testimony of several workwomen: \"M. H., twenty years old, has two\nchildren, the youngest a baby, that is tended by the other, a little\nolder.  The mother goes to the mill shortly after five o'clock in the\nmorning, and comes home at eight at night; all day the milk pours from\nher breasts, so that her clothing drips with it.\"  \"H. W. has three\nchildren, goes away Monday morning at five o'clock, and comes back\nSaturday evening; has so much to do for the children then that she cannot\nget to bed before three o'clock in the morning; often wet through to the\nskin, and obliged to work in that state.\"  She said: \"My breasts have\ngiven me the most frightful pain, and I have been dripping wet with\nmilk.\"  The use of narcotics to keep the children still is fostered by\nthis infamous system, and has reached a great extent in the factory\ndistricts.  Dr. Johns, Registrar in Chief for Manchester, is of opinion\nthat this custom is the chief source of the many deaths from convulsions.\nThe employment of the wife dissolves the family utterly and of necessity,\nand this dissolution, in our present society, which is based upon the\nfamily, brings the most demoralising consequences for parents as well as\nchildren.  A mother who has no time to trouble herself about her child,\nto perform the most ordinary loving services for it during its first\nyear, who scarcely indeed sees it, can be no real mother to the child,\nmust inevitably grow indifferent to it, treat it unlovingly like a\nstranger.  The children who grow up under such conditions are utterly\nruined for later family life, can never feel at home in the family which\nthey themselves found, because they have always been accustomed to\nisolation, and they contribute therefore to the already general\nundermining of the family in the working-class.  A similar dissolution of\nthe family is brought about by the employment of the children.  When they\nget on far enough to earn more than they cost their parents from week to\nweek, they begin to pay the parents a fixed sum for board and lodging,\nand keep the rest for themselves.  This often happens from the fourteenth\nor fifteenth year. {144}  In a word, the children emancipate themselves,\nand regard the paternal dwelling as a lodging-house, which they often\nexchange for another, as suits them.\n\nIn many cases the family is not wholly dissolved by the employment of the\nwife, but turned upside down.  The wife supports the family, the husband\nsits at home, tends the children, sweeps the room and cooks.  This case\nhappens very frequently; in Manchester alone, many hundred such men could\nbe cited, condemned to domestic occupations.  It is easy to imagine the\nwrath aroused among the working-men by this reversal of all relations\nwithin the family, while the other social conditions remain unchanged.\nThere lies before me a letter from an English working-man, Robert\nPounder, Baron's Buildings, Woodhouse, Moorside, in Leeds (the\nbourgeoisie may hunt him up there; I give the exact address for the\npurpose), written by him to Oastler: {145}\n\nHe relates how another working-man, being on tramp, came to St. Helens,\nin Lancashire, and there looked up an old friend.  He found him in a\nmiserable, damp cellar, scarcely furnished; and when my poor friend went\nin, there sat poor Jack near the fire, and what did he, think you? why he\nsat and mended his wife's stockings with the bodkin; and as soon as he\nsaw his old friend at the door-post, he tried to hide them.  But Joe,\nthat is my friend's name, had seen it, and said: \"Jack, what the devil\nart thou doing?  Where is the missus?  Why, is that thy work?\" and poor\nJack was ashamed, and said: \"No, I know this is not my work, but my poor\nmissus is i' th' factory; she has to leave at half-past five and works\ntill eight at night, and then she is so knocked up that she cannot do\naught when she gets home, so I have to do everything for her what I can,\nfor I have no work, nor had any for more nor three years, and I shall\nnever have any more work while I live;\" and then he wept a big tear.  Jack\nagain said: \"There is work enough for women folks and childer hereabouts,\nbut none for men; thou mayest sooner find a hundred pound on the road\nthan work for men--but I should never have believed that either thou or\nany one else would have seen me mending my wife's stockings, for, it is\nbad work.  But she can hardly stand on her feet; I am afraid she will be\nlaid up, and then I don't know what is to become of us, for it's a good\nbit that she has been the man in the house and I the woman; it is bad\nwork, Joe;\" and he cried bitterly, and said, \"It has not been always so.\"\n\"No,\" said Joe; \"but when thou hadn't no work, how hast thou not\nshifted?\"  \"I'll tell thee, Joe, as well as I can, but it was bad enough;\nthou knowest when I got married I had work plenty, and thou knows I was\nnot lazy.\"  \"No, that thou wert not.\"  \"And we had a good furnished\nhouse, and Mary need not go to work.  I could work for the two of us; but\nnow the world is upside down.  Mary has to work and I have to stop at\nhome, mind the childer sweep and wash, bake and mend; and, when the poor\nwoman comes home at night, she is knocked up.  Thou knows, Joe, it's hard\nfor one that was used different.\"  \"Yes, boy, it is hard.\"  And then Jack\nbegan to cry again, and he wished he had never married, and that he had\nnever been born; but he had never thought, when he wed Mary, that it\nwould come to this.  \"I have often cried over it,\" said Jack.  Now when\nJoe heard this, he told me that he had cursed and damned the factories,\nand the masters, and the Government, with all the curses that he had\nlearned while he was in the factory from a child.\n\nCan any one imagine a more insane state of things than that described in\nthis letter?  And yet this condition, which unsexes the man and takes\nfrom the woman all womanliness without being able to bestow upon the man\ntrue womanliness, or the woman true manliness--this condition which\ndegrades, in the most shameful way, both sexes, and, through them,\nHumanity, is the last result of our much-praised civilisation, the final\nachievement of all the efforts and struggles of hundreds of generations\nto improve their own situation and that of their posterity.  We must\neither despair of mankind, and its aims and efforts, when we see all our\nlabour and toil result in such a mockery, or we must admit that human\nsociety has hitherto sought salvation in a false direction; we must admit\nthat so total a reversal of the position of the sexes can have come to\npass only because the sexes have been placed in a false position from the\nbeginning.  If the reign of the wife over the husband, as inevitably\nbrought about by the factory system, is inhuman, the pristine rule of the\nhusband over the wife must have been inhuman too.  If the wife can now\nbase her supremacy upon the fact that she supplies the greater part, nay,\nthe whole of the common possession, the necessary inference is that this\ncommunity of possession is no true and rational one, since one member of\nthe family boasts offensively of contributing the greater share.  If the\nfamily of our present society is being thus dissolved, this dissolution\nmerely shows that, at bottom, the binding tie of this family was not\nfamily affection, but private interest lurking under the cloak of a\npretended community of possessions.  The same relation exists on the part\nof those children who support unemployed parents {147a} when they do not\ndirectly pay board as already referred to.  Dr. Hawkins testified in the\nFactories' Inquiry Commission's Report that this relation is common\nenough, and in Manchester it is notorious.  In this case the children are\nthe masters in the house, as the wife was in the former case, and Lord\nAshley gives an example of this in his speech: {147b} A man berated his\ntwo daughters for going to the public house, and they answered that they\nwere tired of being ordered about, saying, \"Damn you, we have to keep\nyou!\"  Determined to keep the proceeds of their work for themselves, they\nleft the family dwelling, and abandoned their parents to their fate.\n\nThe unmarried women, who have grown up in mills, are no better off than\nthe married ones.  It is self-evident that a girl who has worked in a\nmill from her ninth year is in no position to understand domestic work,\nwhence it follows that female operatives prove wholly inexperienced and\nunfit as housekeepers.  They cannot knit or sew, cook or wash, are\nunacquainted with the most ordinary duties of a housekeeper, and when\nthey have young children to take care of, have not the vaguest idea how\nto set about it.  The Factories' Inquiry Commission's Report gives dozens\nof examples of this, and Dr. Hawkins, Commissioner for Lancashire,\nexpresses his opinion as follows: {147c}\n\n   \"The girls marry early and recklessly; they have neither means, time,\n   nor opportunity to learn the ordinary duties of household life; but if\n   they had them all, they would find no time in married life for the\n   performance of these duties.  The mother is more than twelve hours\n   away from her child daily; the baby is cared for by a young girl or an\n   old woman, to whom it is given to nurse.  Besides this, the dwelling\n   of the mill-hands is too often no home but a cellar, which contains no\n   cooking or washing utensils, no sewing or mending materials, nothing\n   which makes life agreeable and civilised, or the domestic hearth\n   attractive.  For these and other reasons, and especially for the sake\n   of the better chances of life for the little children, I can but wish\n   and hope that a time may come in which married women will be shut out\n   of the factories.\" {148a}\n\nBut that is the least of the evil.  The moral consequences of the\nemployment of women in factories are even worse.  The collecting of\npersons of both sexes and all ages in a single workroom, the inevitable\ncontact, the crowding into a small space of people, to whom neither\nmental nor moral education has been given, is not calculated for the\nfavourable development of the female character.  The manufacturer, if he\npays any attention to the matter, can interfere only when something\nscandalous actually happens; the permanent, less conspicuous influence of\npersons of dissolute character, upon the more moral, and especially upon\nthe younger ones, he cannot ascertain, and consequently cannot prevent.\nBut precisely this influence is the most injurious.  The language used in\nthe mills is characterised by many witnesses in the report of 1833, as\n\"indecent,\" \"bad,\" \"filthy,\" etc. {148b}  It is the same process upon a\nsmall scale which we have already witnessed upon a large one in the great\ncities.  The centralisation of population has the same influence upon the\nsame persons, whether it affects them in a great city or a small factory.\nThe smaller the mill the closer the packing, and the more unavoidable the\ncontact; and the consequences are not wanting.  A witness in Leicester\nsaid that he would rather let his daughter beg than go into a factory;\nthat they are perfect gates of hell; that most of the prostitutes of the\ntown had their employment in the mills to thank for their present\nsituation. {148c}  Another, in Manchester, \"did not hesitate to assert\nthat three-fourths of the young factory employees, from fourteen to\ntwenty years of age, were unchaste.\" {149a}  Commissioner Cowell\nexpresses it as his opinion, that the morality of the factory operatives\nis somewhat below the average of that of the working-class in general.\n{149b}  And Dr. Hawkins {149c} says:\n\n   \"An estimate of sexual morality cannot readily be reduced to figures;\n   but if I may trust my own observations and the general opinion of\n   those with whom I have spoken, as well as the whole tenor of the\n   testimony furnished me, the aspect of the influence of factory life\n   upon the morality of the youthful female population is most\n   depressing.\"\n\nIt is, besides, a matter of course that factory servitude, like any\nother, and to an even higher degree, confers the _jus primae noctis_ upon\nthe master.  In this respect also the employer is sovereign over the\npersons and charms of his employees.  The threat of discharge suffices to\novercome all resistance in nine cases out of ten, if not in ninety-nine\nout of a hundred, in girls who, in any case, have no strong inducements\nto chastity.  If the master is mean enough, and the official report\nmentions several such cases, his mill is also his harem; and the fact\nthat not all manufacturers use their power, does not in the least change\nthe position of the girls.  In the beginning of manufacturing industry,\nwhen most of the employers were upstarts without education or\nconsideration for the hypocrisy of society, they let nothing interfere\nwith the exercise of their vested rights.\n\nTo form a correct judgment of the influence of factory-work upon the\nhealth of the female sex, it is necessary first to consider the work of\nchildren, and then the nature of the work itself.  From the beginning of\nmanufacturing industry, children have been employed in mills, at first\nalmost exclusively by reason of the smallness of the machines, which were\nlater enlarged.  Even children from the workhouses were employed in\nmultitudes, being rented out for a number of years to the manufacturers\nas apprentices.  They were lodged, fed, and clothed in common, and were,\nof course, completely the slaves of their masters, by whom they were\ntreated with the utmost recklessness and barbarity.  As early as 1796,\nthe public objection to this revolting system found such vigorous\nexpression through Dr. Percival and Sir Robert Peel (father of the\nCabinet Minister, and himself a cotton manufacturer), that in 1802\nParliament passed an Apprentices' Bill, by which the most crying evils\nwere removed.  Gradually the increasing competition of free workpeople\ncrowded out the whole apprentice system; factories were built in cities,\nmachinery was constructed on a larger scale, and workrooms were made more\nairy and wholesome; gradually, too, more work was found for adults and\nyoung persons.  The number of children in the mills diminished somewhat,\nand the age at which they began to work rose a little; few children under\neight or nine years were now employed.  Later, as we shall see, the power\nof the State intervened several times to protect them from the\nmoney-greed of the bourgeoisie.\n\nThe great mortality among children of the working-class, and especially\namong those of the factory operatives, is proof enough of the unwholesome\nconditions under which they pass their first year.  These influences are\nat work, of course, among the children who survive, but not quite so\npowerfully as upon those who succumb.  The result in the most favourable\ncase is a tendency to disease, or some check in development, and\nconsequent less than normal vigour of the constitution.  A nine years old\nchild of a factory operative that has grown up in want, privation, and\nchanging conditions, in cold and damp, with insufficient clothing and\nunwholesome dwellings, is far from having the working force of a child\nbrought up under healthier conditions.  At nine years of age it is sent\ninto the mill to work 6.5 hours (formerly 8, earlier still, 12 to 14,\neven 16 hours) daily, until the thirteenth year; then twelve hours until\nthe eighteenth year.  The old enfeebling influences continue, while the\nwork is added to them.  It is not to be denied that a child of nine\nyears, even an operative's child, can hold out through 6.5 hours' daily\nwork, without any one being able to trace visible bad results in its\ndevelopment directly to this cause; but in no case can its presence in\nthe damp, heavy air of the factory, often at once warm and wet,\ncontribute to good health; and, in any case, it is unpardonable to\nsacrifice to the greed of an unfeeling bourgeoisie the time of children\nwhich should be devoted solely to their physical and mental development,\nwithdraw them from school and the fresh air, in order to wear them out\nfor the benefit of the manufacturers.  The bourgeoisie says: \"If we do\nnot employ the children in the mills, they only remain under conditions\nunfavourable to their development;\" and this is true, on the whole.  But\nwhat does this mean if it is not a confession that the bourgeoisie first\nplaces the children of the working-class under unfavourable conditions,\nand then exploits these bad conditions for its own benefit, appeals to\nthat which is as much its own fault as the factory system, excuses the\nsin of to-day with the sin of yesterday?  And if the Factory Act did not\nin some measure fetter their hands, how this \"humane,\" this \"benevolent\"\nbourgeoisie, which has built its factories solely for the good of the\nworking-class, would take care of the interests of these workers!  Let us\nhear how they acted before the factory inspector was at their heels.\nTheir own admitted testimony shall convict them in the report of the\nFactories' Inquiry Commission of 1833.\n\nThe report of the Central Commission relates that the manufacturers began\nto employ children rarely of five years, often of six, very often of\nseven, usually of eight to nine years; that the working-day often lasted\nfourteen to sixteen hours, exclusive of meals and intervals; that the\nmanufacturers permitted overlookers to flog and maltreat children, and\noften took an active part in so doing themselves.  One case is related of\na Scotch manufacturer, who rode after a sixteen years old runaway, forced\nhim to return running after the employer as fast as the master's horse\ntrotted, and beat him the whole way with a long whip. {151}  In the large\ntowns where the operatives resisted more vigorously, such things\nnaturally happened less often.  But even this long working-day failed to\nsatisfy the greed of the capitalists.  Their aim was to make the capital\ninvested in the building and machinery produce the highest return, by\nevery available means, to make it work as actively as possible.  Hence\nthe manufacturers introduced the shameful system of night-work.  Some of\nthem employed two sets of operatives, each numerous enough to fill the\nwhole mill, and let one set work the twelve hours of the day, and the\nother twelve hours of the night.  It is needless to picture the effect\nupon the frames of young children, and even upon the health of young\npersons and adults, produced by permanent loss of sleep at night, which\ncannot be made good by any amount of sleep during the day.  Irritation of\nthe whole nervous system, with general lassitude and enfeeblement of the\nentire frame, were the inevitable results, with the fostering of\ntemptation to drunkenness and unbridled sexual indulgence.  One\nmanufacturer testifies {152a} that during the two years in which night-\nwork was carried on in his factory, the number of illegitimate children\nborn was doubled, and such general demoralisation prevailed that he was\nobliged to give up night-work.  Other manufacturers were yet more\nbarbarous, requiring many hands to work thirty to forty hours at a\nstretch, several times a week, letting them get a couple of hours sleep\nonly, because the night-shift was not complete, but calculated to replace\na part of the operatives only.\n\nThe reports of the Commission touching this barbarism surpass everything\nthat is known to me in this line.  Such infamies, as are here related,\nare nowhere else to be found--yet we shall see that the bourgeoisie\nconstantly appeals to the testimony of the Commission as being in its own\nfavour.  The consequences of these cruelties became evident quickly\nenough.  The Commissioners mention a crowd of cripples who appeared\nbefore them, who clearly owed their distortion to the long working-hours.\nThis distortion usually consists of a curving of the spinal column and\nlegs, and is described as follows by Francis Sharp, M.R.C.S., of Leeds:\n{152b}\n\n   \"I never saw the peculiar bending of the lower ends of the thigh bones\n   before I came to Leeds.  At first I thought it was rachitis, but I was\n   soon led to change my opinion in consequence of the mass of patients\n   who presented themselves at the hospital, and the appearances of the\n   disease at an age (from the fourteenth to the eighteenth year) in\n   which children are usually not subject to rachitis, as well as by the\n   circumstance that the malady had first appeared after children began\n   to work in the mills.  Thus far I have seen about a hundred such\n   cases, and can, most decidedly, express the opinion that they are the\n   consequences of overwork.  So far as I know they were all mill\n   children, and themselves attributed the evil to this cause.  The\n   number of cases of curvature of the spine which have fallen under my\n   observation, and which were evidently consequent upon too protracted\n   standing, was not less than three hundred.\"\n\nPrecisely similar is the testimony of Dr. Ray, for eighteen years\nphysician in the hospital in Leeds: {153a}\n\n   \"Malformations of the spine are very frequent among mill-hands; some\n   of them consequent upon mere overwork, others the effect of long work\n   upon constitutions originally feeble, or weakened by bad food.\n   Deformities seem even more frequent than these diseases; the knees\n   were bent inward, the ligaments very often relaxed and enfeebled, and\n   the long bones of the legs bent.  The thick ends of these long bones\n   were especially apt to be bent and disproportionately developed, and\n   these patients came from the factories in which long work-hours were\n   of frequent occurrence.\"\n\nSurgeons Beaumont and Sharp, of Bradford, bear the same testimony.  The\nreports of Drinkwater, Power, and Dr. Loudon contain a multitude of\nexamples of such distortions, and those of Tufnell and Sir David Barry,\nwhich are less directed to this point, give single examples. {153b}  The\nCommissioners for Lancashire, Cowell, Tufnell, and Hawkins, have almost\nwholly neglected this aspect of the physiological results of the factory\nsystem, though this district rivals Yorkshire in the number of cripples.\nI have seldom traversed Manchester without meeting three or four of them,\nsuffering from precisely the same distortions of the spinal columns and\nlegs as that described, and I have often been able to observe them\nclosely.  I know one personally who corresponds exactly with the\nforegoing description of Dr. Ray, and who got into this condition in Mr.\nDouglas' factory in Pendleton, an establishment which enjoys an\nunenviable notoriety among the operatives by reason of the former long\nworking periods continued night after night.  It is evident, at a glance,\nwhence the distortions of these cripples come; they all look exactly\nalike.  The knees are bent inward and backwards, the ankles deformed and\nthick, and the spinal column often bent forwards or to one side.  But the\ncrown belongs to the philanthropic manufacturers of the Macclesfield silk\ndistrict.  They employed the youngest children of all, even from five to\nsix years of age.  In the supplementary testimony of Commissioner\nTufnell, I find the statement of a certain factory manager Wright, both\nof whose sisters were most shamefully crippled, and who had once counted\nthe cripples in several streets, some of them the cleanest and neatest\nstreets of Macclesfield.  He found in Townley Street ten, George Street\nfive, Charlotte Street four, Watercots fifteen, Bank Top three, Lord\nStreet seven, Mill Lane twelve, Great George Street two, in the workhouse\ntwo, Park Green one, Peckford Street two, whose families all unanimously\ndeclared that the cripples had become such in consequence of overwork in\nthe silk-twisting mills.  One boy is mentioned so crippled as not to be\nable to go upstairs, and girls deformed in back and hips.\n\nOther deformities also have proceeded from this overwork, especially\nflattening of the foot, which Sir D. Barry {154a} frequently observed, as\ndid the physicians and surgeons in Leeds. {154b}  In cases, in which a\nstronger constitution, better food, and other more favourable\ncircumstances enabled the young operative to resist this effect of a\nbarbarous exploitation, we find, at least, pain in the back, hips, and\nlegs, swollen joints, varicose veins, and large, persistent ulcers in the\nthighs and calves.  These affections are almost universal among the\noperatives.  The reports of Stuart, Mackintosh, and Sir D. Barry contain\nhundreds of examples; indeed, they know almost no operative who did not\nsuffer from some of these affections; and in the remaining reports, the\noccurrence of the same phenomena is attested by many physicians.  The\nreports covering Scotland place it beyond all doubt, that a working-day\nof thirteen hours, even for men and women from eighteen to twenty-two\nyears of age, produces at least these consequences, both in the\nflax-spinning mills of Dundee and Dunfermline, and in the cotton mills of\nGlasgow and Lanark.\n\nAll these affections are easily explained by the nature of factory-work,\nwhich is, as the manufacturers say, very \"light,\" and precisely by reason\nof its lightness, more enervating than any other.  The operatives have\nlittle to do, but must stand the whole time.  Any one who sits down, say\nupon a window-ledge or a basket, is fined, and this perpetual upright\nposition, this constant mechanical pressure of the upper portions of the\nbody upon spinal column, hips, and legs, inevitably produces the results\nmentioned.  This standing is not required by the work itself, and at\nNottingham chairs have been introduced, with the result that these\naffections disappeared, and the operatives ceased to object to the length\nof the working-day.  But in a factory where the operative works solely\nfor the bourgeois, and has small interest in doing his work well, he\nwould probably use the seats more than would be agreeable and profitable\nto the manufacturer; and in order that somewhat less raw material may be\nspoiled for the bourgeois, the operative must sacrifice health and\nstrength. {155}  This long protracted upright position, with the bad\natmosphere prevalent in the mills, entails, besides the deformities\nmentioned, a marked relaxation of all vital energies, and, in\nconsequence, all sorts of other affections general rather than local.  The\natmosphere of the factories is, as a rule, at once damp and warm,\nunusually warmer than is necessary, and, when the ventilation is not\n_very_ good, impure, heavy, deficient in oxygen, filled with dust and the\nsmell of the machine oil, which almost everywhere smears the floor, sinks\ninto it, and becomes rancid.  The operatives are lightly clad by reason\nof the warmth, and would readily take cold in case of irregularity of the\ntemperature; a draught is distasteful to them, the general enervation\nwhich gradually takes possession of all the physical functions diminishes\nthe animal warmth: this must be replaced from without, and nothing is\ntherefore more agreeable to the operative than to have all the doors and\nwindows closed, and to stay in his warm factory-air.  Then comes the\nsudden change of temperature on going out into the cold and wet or frosty\natmosphere, without the means of protection from the rain, or of changing\nwet clothing for dry, a circumstance which perpetually produces colds.\nAnd when one reflects that, with all this, not one single muscle of the\nbody is really exercised, really called into activity, except perhaps\nthose of the legs; that nothing whatsoever counteracts the enervating,\nrelaxing tendency of all these conditions; that every influence is\nwanting which might give the muscles strength, the fibres elasticity and\nconsistency; that from youth up, the operative is deprived of all fresh\nair recreation, it is impossible to wonder at the almost unanimous\ntestimony of the physicians in the Factories' Report, that they find a\ngreat lack of ability to resist disease, a general depression in vital\nactivity, a constant relaxation of the mental and physical powers.  Let\nus hear Sir D. Barry first: {156}\n\n   \"The unfavourable influences of mill-work upon the hands are the\n   following: (1) The inevitable necessity of forcing their mental and\n   bodily effort to keep pace with a machine moved by a uniform and\n   unceasing motive power.  (2) Continuance in an upright position during\n   unnaturally long and quickly recurring periods.  (3) Loss of sleep in\n   consequence of too long working-hours, pain in the legs, and general\n   physical derangement.  To these are often added low, crowded, dusty,\n   or damp workrooms, impure air, a high temperature, and constant\n   perspiration.  Hence the boys especially very soon and with but few\n   exceptions, lose the rosy freshness of childhood, and become paler and\n   thinner than other boys.  Even the hand-weaver's bound boy, who sits\n   before his loom with his bare feet resting upon the clay-floor,\n   retains a fresher appearance, because he occasionally goes into the\n   fresh air for a time.  But the mill child has not a moment free except\n   for meals, and never goes into the fresh air except on its way to\n   them.  All adult male spinners are pale and thin, suffer from\n   capricious appetite and indigestion; and as they are all trained in\n   the mills from their youth up, and there are very few tall, athletic\n   men among them, the conclusion is justified that their occupation is\n   very unfavourable for the development of the male constitution;\n   females bear this work far better.\"  (Very naturally.  But we shall\n   see that they have their own diseases.)\n\nSo, too, Power: {157a}\n\n   \"I can bear witness that the factory system in Bradford has engendered\n   a multitude of cripples, and that the effect of long continued labour\n   upon the physique is apparent, not alone in actual deformity, but\n   also, and much more generally, in stunted growth, relaxation of the\n   muscles, and delicacy of the whole frame.\"\n\nSo, too, F. Sharp, in Leeds, the surgeon {157b} already quoted:\n\n   \"When I moved from Scarborough to Leeds, I was at once struck by the\n   fact that the general appearance of the children was much paler, and\n   their fibre less vigorous here than in Scarborough and its environs.  I\n   saw, too, that many children were exceptionally small for their age.  I\n   have met with numberless cases of scrofula, lung trouble, mesenteric\n   affections, and indigestion, concerning which I, as a medical man,\n   have no doubt that they arose from mill work.  I believe that the\n   nervous energy of the body is weakened by the long hours, and the\n   foundation of many diseases laid.  If people from the country were not\n   constantly coming in, the race of mill-hands would soon be wholly\n   degenerate.\"\n\nSo, too, Beaumont, surgeon in Bradford:\n\n   \"To my thinking, the system, according to which work is done in the\n   mills here, produces a peculiar relaxation of the whole organism, and\n   thereby makes children in the highest degree susceptible to epidemic,\n   as well as to incidental illness.  I regard the absence of all\n   appropriate regulations for ventilation and cleanliness in the mills\n   very decidedly as the chief cause of that peculiar tendency or\n   susceptibility to morbid affections which I have so frequently met in\n   my practice.\"\n\nSimilar testimony is borne by Dr. Ray:\n\n   (1)  \"I have had opportunity of observing the effects of the factory\n   system upon the health of children under the most favourable\n   circumstances (in Wood's mill, in Bradford, the best arranged of the\n   district, in which he was factory surgeon). (2)  These effects are\n   decidedly, and to a very great extent, injurious, even under these\n   most favourable circumstances. (3)  In the year 1842, three-fifths of\n   all the children employed in Wood's mill were treated by me. (4)  The\n   worst effect is not the predominance of deformities, but of enfeebled\n   and morbid constitutions. (5)  All this is greatly improved since the\n   working-hours of children have been reduced at Wood's to ten.\"\n\nThe Commissioner, Dr. Loudon himself, who cites these witnesses, says:\n\n   \"In conclusion, I think it has been clearly proved that children have\n   been worked a most unreasonable and cruel length of time daily, and\n   that even adults have been expected to do a certain quantity of labour\n   which scarcely any human being is able to endure.  The consequence is\n   that many have died prematurely, and others are afflicted for life\n   with defective constitutions, and the fear of a posterity enfeebled by\n   the shattered constitution of the survivors is but too well founded,\n   from a physiological point of view.\"\n\nAnd, finally, Dr. Hawkins, in speaking of Manchester:\n\n   \"I believe that most travellers are struck by the lowness of stature,\n   the leanness and the paleness which present themselves so commonly to\n   the eye at Manchester, and above all, among the factory classes.  I\n   have never been in any town in Great Britain, nor in Europe, in which\n   degeneracy of form and colour from the national standard has been so\n   obvious.  Among the married women all the characteristic peculiarities\n   of the English wife are conspicuously wanting.  I must confess that\n   all the boys and girls brought before me from the Manchester mills had\n   a depressed appearance, and were very pale.  In the expression of\n   their faces lay nothing of the usual mobility, liveliness, and\n   cheeriness of youth.  Many of them told me that they felt not the\n   slightest inclination to play out of doors on Saturday and Sunday, but\n   preferred to be quiet at home.\"\n\nI add, at once, another passage of Hawkins' report, which only half\nbelongs here, but may be quoted here as well as anywhere else:\n\n   \"Intemperance, excess, and want of providence are the chief faults of\n   the factory population, and these evils may be readily traced to the\n   habits which are formed under the present system, and almost\n   inevitably arise from it.  It is universally admitted that\n   indigestion, hypochondria, and general debility affect this class to a\n   very great extent.  After twelve hours of monotonous toil, it is but\n   natural to look about for a stimulant of one sort or another; but when\n   the above-mentioned diseased conditions are added to the customary\n   weariness, people will quickly and repeatedly take refuge in\n   spirituous liquors.\"\n\nFor all this testimony of the physicians and commissioners, the report\nitself offers hundreds of cases of proof.  That the growth of young\noperatives is stunted, by their work, hundreds of statements testify;\namong others, Cowell gives the weight of 46 youths of 17 years of age,\nfrom one Sunday school, of whom 26 employed in mills, averaged 104.5\npounds, and 20 not employed in mills, 117.7 pounds.  One of the largest\nmanufacturers of Manchester, leader of the opposition against the working-\nmen, I think Robert Hyde Greg himself, said, on one occasion, that if\nthings went on as at present, the operatives of Lancashire would soon be\na race of pigmies. {159a}  A recruiting officer {159b} testified that\noperatives are little adapted for military service, looked thin and\nnervous, and were frequently rejected by the surgeons as unfit.  In\nManchester he could hardly get men of five feet eight inches; they were\nusually only five feet six to seven, whereas in the agricultural\ndistricts, most of the recruits were five feet eight.\n\nThe men wear out very early in consequence of the conditions under which\nthey live and work.  Most of them are unfit for work at forty years, a\nfew hold out to forty-five, almost none to fifty years of age.  This is\ncaused not only by the general enfeeblement of the frame, but also very\noften by a failure of the sight, which is a result of mule-spinning, in\nwhich the operative is obliged to fix his gaze upon a long row of fine,\nparallel threads, and so greatly to strain the sight.\n\nOf 1,600 operatives employed in several factories in Harpur and Lanark,\nbut 10 were over 45 years of age; of 22,094 operatives in diverse\nfactories in Stockport and Manchester, but 143 were over 45 years old.  Of\nthese 143, 16 were retained as a special favour, and one was doing the\nwork of a child.  A list of 131 spinners contained but seven over 45\nyears, and yet the whole 131 were rejected by the manufacturers, to whom\nthey applied for work, as \"too old,\" and were without means of support by\nreason of old age!  Mr. Ashworth, a large manufacturer, admits in a\nletter to Lord Ashley, that, towards the fortieth year, the spinners can\nno longer prepare the required quantity of yarn, and are therefore\n\"sometimes\" discharged; he calls operatives forty years of age \"old\npeople!\"  Commissioner Mackintosh expresses himself in the same way in\nthe report of 1833:\n\n   \"Although I was prepared for it from the way the children are\n   employed, I still found it difficult to believe the statements of the\n   older hands as to their ages; they age so very early.\"\n\nSurgeon Smellie, of Glasgow, who treated operatives chiefly, says that\nforty years is old age for them. {160a}  And similar evidence may be\nfound elsewhere. {160b}  In Manchester, this premature old age among the\noperatives is so universal that almost every man of forty would be taken\nfor ten to fifteen years older, while the prosperous classes, men as well\nas women, preserve their appearance exceedingly well if they do not drink\ntoo heavily.\n\nThe influence of factory-work upon the female physique also is marked and\npeculiar.  The deformities entailed by long hours of work are much more\nserious among women.  Protracted work frequently causes deformities of\nthe pelvis, partly in the shape of abnormal position and development of\nthe hip bones, partly of malformation of the lower portion of the spinal\ncolumn.\n\n   \"Although,\" says Dr. Loudon, in his report, \"no example of\n   malformation of the pelvis and of some other affections came under my\n   notice, these things are nevertheless so common, that every physician\n   must regard them as probable consequences of such working-hours, and\n   as vouched for besides by men of the highest medical credibility.\"\n\nThat factory operatives undergo more difficult confinement than other\nwomen is testified to by several midwives and accoucheurs, and also that\nthey are more liable to miscarriage. {161}  Moreover, they suffer from\nthe general enfeeblement common to all operatives, and, when pregnant,\ncontinue to work in the factory up to the hour of delivery, because\notherwise they lose their wages and are made to fear that they may be\nreplaced if they stop away too soon.  It frequently happens that women\nare at work one evening and delivered the next morning, and the case is\nnone too rare of their being delivered in the factory among the\nmachinery.  And if the gentlemen of the bourgeoisie find nothing\nparticularly shocking in this, their wives will perhaps admit that it is\na piece of cruelty, an infamous act of barbarism, indirectly to force a\npregnant woman to work twelve or thirteen hours daily (formerly still\nlonger), up to the day of her delivery, in a standing position, with\nfrequent stoopings.  But this is not all.  If these women are not obliged\nto resume work within two weeks, they are thankful, and count themselves\nfortunate.  Many come back to the factory after eight, and even after\nthree to four days, to resume full work.  I once heard a manufacturer ask\nan overlooker: \"Is so and so not back yet?\"  \"No.\"  \"How long since she\nwas confined?\"  \"A week.\"  \"She might surely have been back long ago.\nThat one over there only stays three days.\"  Naturally, fear of being\ndischarged, dread of starvation drives her to the factory in spite of her\nweakness, in defiance of her pain.  The interest of the manufacturer will\nnot brook that his employees stay at home by reason of illness; they must\nnot be ill, they must not venture to lie still through a long\nconfinement, or he must stop his machinery or trouble his supreme head\nwith a temporary change of arrangements, and rather than do this, he\ndischarges his people when they begin to be ill.  Listen: {162a}\n\n   \"A girl feels very ill, can scarcely do her work.  Why does she not\n   ask permission to go home?  Ah! the master is very particular, and if\n   we are away half a day, we risk being sent away altogether.\"\n\nOr Sir D. Barry: {162b}\n\n   \"Thomas McDurt, workman, has slight fever.  Cannot stay at home longer\n   than four days, because he would fear of losing his place.\"\n\nAnd so it goes on in almost all the factories.  The employment of young\ngirls produces all sorts of irregularities during the period of\ndevelopment.  In some, especially those who are better fed, the heat of\nthe factories hastens this process, so that in single cases, girls of\nthirteen and fourteen are wholly mature.  Robertson, whom I have already\ncited (mentioned in the Factories' Inquiry Commission's Report as the\n\"eminent\" gynaecologist of Manchester), relates in the North of England\n_Medical and Surgical Journal_, that he had seen a girl of eleven years\nwho was not only a wholly developed woman, but pregnant, and that it was\nby no means rare in Manchester for women to be confined at fifteen years\nof age.  In such cases, the influence of the warmth of the factories is\nthe same as that of a tropical climate, and, as in such climates, the\nabnormally early development revenges itself by correspondingly premature\nage and debility.  On the other hand, retarded development of the female\nconstitution occurs, the breasts mature late or not at all. {162c}\nMenstruation first appears in the seventeenth or Eighteenth, sometimes in\nthe twentieth year, and is often wholly wanting. {163a}  Irregular\nmenstruation, coupled with great pain and numerous affections, especially\nwith anaemia, is very frequent, as the medical reports unanimously state.\n\nChildren of such mothers, particularly of those who are obliged to work\nduring pregnancy, cannot be vigorous.  They are, on the contrary,\ndescribed in the report, especially in Manchester, as very feeble; and\nBarry alone asserts that they are healthy, but says further, that in\nScotland, where his inspection lay, almost no married women worked in\nfactories.  Moreover, most of the factories there are in the country\n(with the exception of Glasgow), a circumstance which contributes greatly\nto the invigoration of the children.  The operatives' children in the\nneighbourhood of Manchester are nearly all thriving and rosy, while those\nwithin the city look pale and scrofulous; but with the ninth year the\ncolour vanishes suddenly, because all are then sent into the factories,\nwhen it soon becomes impossible to distinguish the country from the city\nchildren.\n\nBut besides all this, there are some branches of factory-work which have\nan especially injurious effect.  In many rooms of the cotton and flax-\nspinning mills, the air is filled with fibrous dust, which produces chest\naffections, especially among workers in the carding and combing-rooms.\nSome constitutions can bear it, some cannot; but the operative has no\nchoice.  He must take the room in which he finds work, whether his chest\nis sound or not.  The most common effects of this breathing of dust are\nblood-spitting, hard, noisy breathing, pains in the chest, coughs,\nsleeplessness--in short, all the symptoms of asthma ending in the worst\ncases in consumption. {163b}  Especially unwholesome is the wet spinning\nof linen-yarn which is carried on by young girls and boys.  The water\nspirts over them from the spindle, so that the front of their clothing is\nconstantly wet through to the skin; and there is always water standing on\nthe floor.  This is the case to a less degree in the doubling-rooms of\nthe cotton mills, and the result is a constant succession of colds and\naffections of the chest.  A hoarse, rough voice is common to all\noperatives, but especially to wet spinners and doublers.  Stuart,\nMackintosh, and Sir D. Barry express themselves in the most vigorous\nterms as to the unwholesomeness of this work, and the small consideration\nshown by most of the manufacturers for the health of the girls who do it.\nAnother effect of flax-spinning is a peculiar deformity of the shoulder,\nespecially a projection of the right shoulder-blade, consequent upon the\nnature of the work.  This sort of spinning and the throstle-spinning of\ncotton frequently produce diseases of the knee-pan, which is used to\ncheck the spindle during the joining of broken threads.  The frequent\nstooping and the bending to the low machines common to both these\nbranches of work have, in general, a stunting effect upon the growth of\nthe operative.  In the throstle-room of the cotton mill at Manchester, in\nwhich I was employed, I do not remember to have seen one single tall,\nwell-built girl; they were all short, dumpy, and badly-formed, decidedly\nugly in the whole development of the figure.  But apart from all these\ndiseases and malformations, the limbs of the operatives suffer in still\nanother way.  The work between the machinery gives rise to multitudes of\naccidents of more or less serious nature, which have for the operative\nthe secondary effect of unfitting him for his work more or less\ncompletely.  The most common accident is the squeezing off of a single\njoint of a finger, somewhat less common the loss of the whole finger,\nhalf or a whole hand, an arm, etc., in the machinery.  Lockjaw very often\nfollows, even upon the lesser among these injuries, and brings death with\nit.  Besides the deformed persons, a great number of maimed ones may be\nseen going about in Manchester; this one has lost an arm or a part of\none, that one a foot, the third half a leg; it is like living in the\nmidst of an army just returned from a campaign.  But the most dangerous\nportion of the machinery is the strapping which conveys motive power from\nthe shaft to the separate machines, especially if it contains buckles,\nwhich, however, are rarely used now.  Whoever is seized by the strap is\ncarried up with lightning speed, thrown against the ceiling above and\nfloor below with such force that there is rarely a whole bone left in the\nbody, and death follows instantly.  Between June 12th and August 3rd,\n1843, the _Manchester Guardian_ reported the following serious accidents\n(the trifling ones it does not notice): June 12th, a boy died in\nManchester of lockjaw, caused by his hand being crushed between wheels.\nJune 16th, a youth in Saddleworth seized by a wheel and carried away with\nit; died, utterly mangled.  June 29th, a young man at Green Acres Moor,\nnear Manchester, at work in a machine shop, fell under the grindstone,\nwhich broke two of his ribs and lacerated him terribly.  July 24th, a\ngirl in Oldham died, carried around fifty times by a strap; no bone\nunbroken.  July 27th, a girl in Manchester seized by the blower (the\nfirst machine that receives the raw cotton), and died of injuries\nreceived.  August 3rd, a bobbins turner died in Dukenfield, caught in a\nstrap, every rib broken.  In the year 1843, the Manchester Infirmary\ntreated 962 cases of wounds and mutilations caused by machinery, while\nthe number of all other accidents within the district of the hospital was\n2,426, so that for five accidents from all other causes, two were caused\nby machinery.  The accidents which happened in Salford are not included\nhere, nor those treated by surgeons in private practice.  In such cases,\nwhether or not the accident unfits the victim for further work, the\nemployer, at best, pays the doctor, or, in very exceptional cases, he may\npay wages during treatment; what becomes of the operative afterwards, in\ncase he cannot work, is no concern of the employer.\n\nThe Factory Report says on this subject, that employers must be made\nresponsible for all cases, since children cannot take care, and adults\nwill take care in their own interest.  But the gentlemen who write the\nreport are bourgeois, and so they must contradict themselves and bring up\nlater all sorts of bosh on the subject of the culpable temerity of the\noperatives.\n\nThe state of the case is this: If children cannot take care, the\nemployment of children must be forbidden.  If adults are reckless, they\nmust be mere over-grown children on a plane of intelligence which does\nnot enable them to appreciate the danger in its full scope; and who is to\nblame for this but the bourgeoisie which keeps them in a condition in\nwhich their intelligence cannot develop?  Or the machinery is\nill-arranged, and must be surrounded with fencing, to supply which falls\nto the share of the bourgeoisie.  Or the operative is under inducements\nwhich outweigh the threatened danger; he must work rapidly to earn his\nwages, has no time to take care, and for this, too, the bourgeoisie is to\nblame.  Many accidents happen, for instance, while the operatives are\ncleaning machinery in motion.  Why?  Because the bourgeois would\notherwise oblige the worker to clean the machinery during the free hours\nwhile it is not going, and the worker naturally is not disposed to\nsacrifice any part of his free time.  Every free hour is so precious to\nthe worker that he often risks his life twice a week rather than\nsacrifice one of them to the bourgeois.  Let the employer take from\nworking-hours the time required for cleaning the machinery, and it will\nnever again occur to an operative to clean machinery in motion.  In\nshort, from whatever point of view, the blame falls ultimately on the\nmanufacturer, and of him should be required, at the very least, life-long\nsupport of the incapacitated operative, and support of the victim's\nfamily in case death follows the accident.  In the earliest period of\nmanufacture, the accidents were much more numerous in proportion than\nnow, for the machinery was inferior, smaller, more crowded, and almost\nnever fenced.  But the number is still large enough, as the foregoing\ncases prove, to arouse grave question as to a state of things which\npermits so many deformities and mutilations for the benefit of a single\nclass, and plunges so many industrious working-people into want and\nstarvation by reason of injuries undergone in the service and through the\nfault of the bourgeoisie.\n\nA pretty list of diseases engendered purely by the hateful money greed of\nthe manufacturers!  Women made unfit for childbearing, children deformed,\nmen enfeebled, limbs crushed, whole generations wrecked, afflicted with\ndisease and infirmity, purely to fill the purses of the bourgeoisie.  And\nwhen one reads of the barbarism of single cases, how children are seized\nnaked in bed by the overlookers, and driven with blows and kicks to the\nfactory, their clothing over their arms, {167a} how their sleepiness is\ndriven off with blows, how they fall asleep over their work nevertheless,\nhow one poor child sprang up, still asleep, at the call of the\noverlooker, and mechanically went through the operations of its work\nafter its machine was stopped; when one reads how children, too tired to\ngo home, hide away in the wool in the drying-room to sleep there, and\ncould only be driven out of the factory with straps; how many hundreds\ncame home so tired every night, that they could eat no supper for\nsleepiness and want of appetite, that their parents found them kneeling\nby the bedside, where they had fallen asleep during their prayers; when\none reads all this and a hundred other villainies and infamies in this\none report, all testified to on oath, confirmed by several witnesses,\ndeposed by men whom the commissioners themselves declare trustworthy;\nwhen one reflects that this is a Liberal report, a bourgeois report, made\nfor the purpose of reversing the previous Tory report, and rehabilitating\nthe pureness of heart of the manufacturers, that the commissioners\nthemselves are on the side of the bourgeoisie, and report all these\nthings against their own will, how can one be otherwise than filled with\nwrath and resentment against a class which boasts of philanthropy and\nself-sacrifice, while its one object is to fill its purse _a tout prix_?\nMeanwhile, let us listen to the bourgeoisie speaking through the mouth of\nits chosen apostle, Dr. Ure, who relates in his \"Philosophy of\nManufactures\" {167b} that the workers have been told that their wages\nbore no proportion to their sacrifices, the good understanding between\nmasters and men being thus disturbed.  Instead of this, the working-men\nshould have striven to recommend themselves by attention and industry,\nand should have rejoiced in the prosperity of their masters.  They would\nthen become overseers, superintendents, and finally partners, and would\nthus--(Oh!  Wisdom, thou speakest as the dove!)--\"have increased at the\nsame time the demand for their companions' labour in the market!\"\n\n   \"Had it not been for the violent collisions and interruptions\n   resulting from erroneous views among the operatives, the factory\n   system would have been developed still more rapidly and beneficially.\"\n   {168a}\n\nHereupon follows a long Jeremiad upon the spirit of resistance of the\noperatives, and on the occasion of a strike of the best paid workers, the\nfine spinners, the following naive observation: {168b}\n\n   \"In fact, it was their high wages which enabled them to maintain a\n   stipendiary committee in affluence, and to pamper themselves into\n   nervous ailments, by a diet too rich and exciting for their indoor\n   employments.\"\n\nLet us hear how the bourgeois describes the work of children: {168c}\n\n   \"I have visited many factories, both in Manchester and in the\n   surrounding districts, during a period of several months, entering the\n   spinning-rooms unexpectedly, and often alone, at different times of\n   the day, and I never saw a single instance of corporal chastisement\n   inflicted on a child; nor, indeed, did I ever see children in\n   ill-humour.  They seemed to be always cheerful and alert; taking\n   pleasure in the light play of their muscles, enjoying the mobility\n   natural to their age.  The scene of industry, so far from exciting sad\n   emotions, in my mind, was always exhilerating.  It was delightful to\n   observe the nimbleness with which they pieced broken ends, as the mule\n   carriage began to recede from the fixed roller beam, and to see them\n   at leisure, after a few seconds' exercise of their tiny fingers, to\n   amuse themselves in any attitude they chose, till the stretch and\n   winding on were once more completed.  The work of these lively elves\n   seemed to resemble a sport, in which habit gave them a pleasing\n   dexterity.  Conscious of their skill, they were delighted to show it\n   off to any stranger.  As to exhaustion by the day's work, they evinced\n   no trace of it on emerging from the mill in the evening; for they\n   immediately began to skip about any neighbouring playground, and to\n   commence their little games with the same alacrity as boys issuing\n   from a school.\"\n\nNaturally!  As though the immediate movement of every muscle were not an\nurgent necessity for frames grown at once stiff and relaxed!  But Ure\nshould have waited to see whether this momentary excitement had not\nsubsided after a couple of minutes.  And besides, Ure could see this\nwhole performance only in the afternoon after five or six hours' work,\nbut not in the evening!  As to the health of the operatives, the\nbourgeois has the boundless impudence to cite the report of 1833 just\nquoted in a thousand places, as testimony for the excellent health of\nthese people; to try to prove by detached and garbled quotations that no\ntrace of scrofula can be found among them, and, what is quite true, that\nthe factory system frees them from all acute diseases, (that they have\nevery variety of chronic affection instead he naturally conceals).  To\nexplain the impudence with which our friend Ure palms off the grossest\nfalsehoods upon the English public, it must be known that the report\nconsists of three large folio volumes, which it never occurs to a well-\nfed English bourgeois to study through.  Let us hear further how he\nexpresses himself as to the Factory Act of 1834, passed by the Liberal\nbourgeoisie, and imposing only the most meagre limitations upon the\nmanufacturers, as we shall see.  This law, especially its compulsory\neducation clause, he calls an absurd and despotic measure directed\nagainst the manufacturers, through which all children under twelve years\nof age have been thrown out of employment; and with what results?  The\nchildren thus discharged from their light and useful occupation receive\nno education whatsoever; cast out from the warm spinning-room into a cold\nworld, they subsist only by begging and stealing, a life in sad contrast\nwith their steadily improving condition in the factory and in Sunday\nschool.  Under the mask of philanthropy, this law intensifies the\nsufferings of the poor, and will greatly restrict the conscientious\nmanufacturer in his useful work, if, indeed, it does not wholly stop him.\n{169}\n\nThe ruinous influence of the factory system began at an early day to\nattract general attention.  We have already alluded to the Apprentices'\nAct of 1802.  Later, towards 1817, Robert Owen, then a manufacturer in\nNew Lanark, in Scotland, afterwards founder of English Socialism, began\nto call the attention of the Government, by memorials and petitions, to\nthe necessity of legislative guarantees for the health of the operatives,\nand especially of children.  The late Sir Robert Peel and other\nphilanthropists united with him, and gradually secured the Factory Acts\nof 1818, 1825, and 1831, of which the first two were never enforced, and\nthe last only here and there.  This law of 1831, based upon the motion of\nSir J. C. Hobhouse, provided that in cotton mills no one under twenty-one\nshould be employed between half-past seven at night and half-past five in\nthe morning; and that in all factories young persons under eighteen\nshould work no longer than twelve hours daily, and nine hours on\nSaturday.  But since operatives could not testify against their masters\nwithout being discharged, this law helped matters very little.  In the\ngreat cities, where the operatives were more restive, the larger\nmanufacturers came to an agreement among themselves to obey the law; but\neven there, there were many who, like the employers in the country, did\nnot trouble themselves about it.  Meanwhile, the demand for a ten hours'\nlaw had become lively among the operatives; that is, for a law which\nshould forbid all operatives under eighteen years of age to work longer\nthan ten hours daily; the Trades Unions, by their agitation, made this\ndemand general throughout the manufacturing population; the philanthropic\nsection of the Tory party, then led by Michael Sadler, seized upon the\nplan, and brought it before Parliament.  Sadler obtained a parliamentary\ncommittee for the investigation of the factory system, and this committee\nreported in 1832.  Its report was emphatically partisan, composed by\nstrong enemies of the factory system, for party ends.  Sadler permitted\nhimself to be betrayed by his noble enthusiasm into the most distorted\nand erroneous statements, drew from his witnesses by the very form of his\nquestions, answers which contained the truth, but truth in a perverted\nform.  The manufacturers themselves, incensed at a report which\nrepresented them as monsters, now demanded an official investigation;\nthey knew that an exact report must, in this case, be advantageous to\nthem; they knew that Whigs, genuine bourgeois, were at the helm, with\nwhom they were upon good terms, whose principles were opposed to any\nrestriction upon manufacture.  They obtained a commission, in due order,\ncomposed of Liberal bourgeois, whose report I have so often cited.  This\ncomes somewhat nearer the truth than Sadler's, but its deviations\ntherefrom are in the opposite direction.  On every page it betrays\nsympathy with the manufacturers, distrust of the Sadler report,\nrepugnance to the working-men agitating independently and the supporters\nof the Ten Hours' Bill.  It nowhere recognises the right of the working-\nman to a life worthy of a human being, to independent activity, and\nopinions of his own.  It reproaches the operatives that in sustaining the\nTen Hours' Bill they thought, not of the children only, but of themselves\nas well; it calls the working-men engaged in the agitation demagogues,\nill-intentioned, malicious, etc., is written, in short, on the side of\nthe bourgeoisie; and still it cannot whitewash the manufacturers, and\nstill it leaves such a mass of infamies upon the shoulders of the\nemployers, that even after this report, the agitation for the Ten Hours'\nBill, the hatred against the manufacturers, and the committee's severest\nepithets applied to them are all fully justified.  But there was the one\ndifference, that whereas the Sadler report accuses the manufacturers of\nopen, undisguised brutality, it now became evident that this brutality\nwas chiefly carried on under the mask of civilisation and humanity.  Yet\nDr. Hawkins, the medical commissioner for Lancashire, expresses himself\ndecidedly in favour of the Ten Hours' Bill in the opening lines of his\nreport, and Commissioner Mackintosh explains that his own report does not\ncontain the whole truth, because it is very difficult to induce the\noperatives to testify against their employers, and because the\nmanufacturers, besides being forced into greater concessions towards\ntheir operatives by the excitement among the latter, are often prepared\nfor the inspection of the factories, have them swept, the speed of the\nmachinery reduced, etc.  In Lancashire especially they resorted to the\ndevice of bringing the overlookers of workrooms before the commissioners,\nand letting them testify as working-men to the humanity of the employers,\nthe wholesome effects of the work, and the indifference, if not the\nhostility of the operatives, towards the Ten Hours' Bill.  But these are\nnot genuine working-men; they are deserters from their class, who have\nentered the service of the bourgeoisie for better pay, and fight in the\ninterests of the capitalists against the workers.  Their interest is that\nof the capitalists, and they are, therefore, almost more hated by the\nworkers than the manufacturers themselves.\n\nAnd yet this report suffices wholly to exhibit the most shameful\nrecklessness of the manufacturing bourgeoisie towards its employees, the\nwhole infamy of the industrial exploiting system in its full inhumanity.\nNothing is more revolting than to compare the long register of diseases\nand deformities engendered by overwork, in this report, with the cold,\ncalculating political economy of the manufacturers, by which they try to\nprove that they, and with them all England, must go to ruin, if they\nshould be forbidden to cripple so and so many children every year.  The\nlanguage of Dr. Ure alone, which I have quoted, would be yet more\nrevolting if it were not so preposterous.\n\nThe result of this report was the Factory Act of 1834, which forbade the\nemployment of children under nine years of age (except in silk mills),\nlimited the working-hours of children between 9-13 years to 48 per week,\nor 9 hours in any one day at the utmost; that of young persons from 14-18\nyears of age to 69 per week, or 12 on any one day as the maximum,\nprovided for an hour and a half as the minimum interval for meals, and\nrepeated the total prohibition of night-work for persons under eighteen\nyears of age.  Compulsory school attendance two hours daily was\nprescribed for all children under fourteen years, and the manufacturer\ndeclared punishable in case of employing children without a certificate\nof age from the factory surgeon, and a certificate of school attendance\nfrom the teacher.  As recompense, the employer was permitted to withdraw\none penny from the child's weekly earnings to pay the teacher.  Further,\nsurgeons and inspectors were appointed to visit the factories at all\ntimes, take testimony of operatives on oath, and enforce the law by\nprosecution before a Justice of the Peace.  This is the law against which\nDr. Ure inveighs in such unmeasured terms!\n\nThe consequence of this law, and especially of the appointment of\ninspectors, was the reduction of working-hours to an average of twelve to\nthirteen, and the superseding of children as far as possible.  Hereupon\nsome of the most crying evils disappeared almost wholly.  Deformities\narose now only in cases of weak constitution, and the effects of overwork\nbecame much less conspicuous.  Nevertheless, enough testimony remains to\nbe found in the Factory Report, that the lesser evils, swelling of the\nankles, weakness and pain in the legs, hips, and back, varicose veins,\nulcers on the lower extremities, general weakness, especially of the\npelvic region, nausea, want of appetite alternating with unnatural\nhunger, indigestion, hypochondria, affections of the chest in consequence\nof the dust and foul atmosphere of the factories, etc. etc., all occur\namong employees subject to the provisions of Sir J. C. Hobhouse's law (of\n1831), which prescribes twelve to thirteen hours as the maximum.  The\nreports from Glasgow and Manchester are especially worthy of attention in\nthis respect.  These evils remained too, after the law of 1834, and\ncontinue to undermine the health of the working-class to this day.  Care\nhas been taken to give the brutal profit-greed of the bourgeoisie a\nhypocritical, civilised form, to restrain the manufacturers through the\narm of the law from too conspicuous villainies, and thus to give them a\npretext for self-complacently parading their sham philanthropy.  That is\nall.  If a new commission were appointed to-day, it would find things\npretty much as before.  As to the extemporised compulsory attendance at\nschool, it remained wholly a dead letter, since the Government failed to\nprovide good schools.  The manufacturers employed as teachers worn-out\noperatives, to whom they sent the children two hours daily, thus\ncomplying with the letter of the law; but the children learned nothing.\nAnd even the reports of the factory inspectors, which are limited to the\nscope of the inspector's duties, _i.e_., the enforcement of the Factory\nAct, give data enough to justify the conclusion that the old evils\ninevitably remain.  Inspectors Horner and Saunders, in their reports for\nOctober and December, 1844, state that, in a number of branches in which\nthe employment of children can be dispensed with or superseded by that of\nadults, the working-day is still fourteen to sixteen hours, or even\nlonger.  Among the operatives in these branches they found numbers of\nyoung people who had just outgrown the provisions of the law.  Many\nemployers disregard the law, shorten the meal times, work children longer\nthan is permitted, and risk prosecution, knowing that the possible fines\nare trifling in comparison with the certain profits derivable from the\noffence.  Just at present especially, while business is exceptionally\nbrisk, they are under great temptation in this respect.\n\nMeanwhile the agitation for the Ten Hours' Bill by no means died out\namong the operatives; in 1839 it was under full headway once more, and\nSadler's place, he having died, was filled in the House of Commons by\nLord Ashley {174} and Richard Oastler, both Tories.  Oastler especially,\nwho carried on a constant agitation in the factory districts, and had\nbeen active in the same way during Sadler's life, was the particular\nfavourite of the working-men.  They called him their \"good old king,\"\n\"the king of the factory children,\" and there is not a child in the\nfactory districts that does not know and revere him, that does not join\nthe procession which moves to welcome him when he enters a town.  Oastler\nvigorously opposed the New Poor Law also, and was therefore imprisoned\nfor debt by a Mr. Thornley, on whose estate he was employed as agent, and\nto whom he owed money.  The Whigs offered repeatedly to pay his debt and\nconfer other favours upon him if he would only give up his agitation\nagainst the Poor Law.  But in vain; he remained in prison, whence he\npublished his Fleet Papers against the factory system and the Poor Law.\n\nThe Tory Government of 1841 turned its attention once more to the Factory\nActs.  The Home Secretary, Sir James Graham, proposed, in 1843, a bill\nrestricting the working-hours of children to six and one-half, and making\nthe enactments for compulsory school attendance more effective; the\nprincipal point in this connection being a provision for better schools.\nThis bill was, however, wrecked by the jealousy of the dissenters; for,\nalthough compulsory religious instruction was not extended to the\nchildren of dissenters, the schools provided for were to be placed under\nthe general supervision of the Established Church, and the Bible made the\ngeneral reading-book; religion being thus made the foundation of all\ninstruction, whence the dissenters felt themselves threatened.  The\nmanufacturers and the Liberals generally united with them, the working-\nmen were divided by the Church question, and therefore inactive.  The\nopponents of the bill, though outweighed in the great manufacturing\ntowns, such as Salford and Stockport, and able in others, such as\nManchester, to attack certain of its points only, for fear of the working-\nmen, collected nevertheless nearly two million signatures for a petition\nagainst it, and Graham allowed himself to be so far intimidated as to\nwithdraw the whole bill.  The next year he omitted the school clauses,\nand proposed that, instead of the previous provisions, children between\neight and thirteen years should be restricted to six and one-half hours,\nand so employed as to have either the whole morning or the whole\nafternoon free; that young people between thirteen and eighteen years,\nand all females, should be limited to twelve hours; and that the hitherto\nfrequent evasions of the law should be prevented.  Hardly had he proposed\nthis bill, when the ten hours' agitation was begun again more vigorously\nthan ever.  Oastler had just then regained his liberty; a number of his\nfriends and a collection among the workers had paid his debt, and he\nthrew himself into the movement with all his might.  The defenders of the\nTen Hours' Bill in the House of Commons had increased in numbers, the\nmasses of petitions supporting it which poured in from all sides brought\nthem allies, and on March 19th, 1844, Lord Ashley carried, with a\nmajority of 179 to 170, a resolution that the word \"Night\" in the Factory\nAct should express the time from six at night to six in the morning,\nwhereby the prohibition of night-work came to mean the limitation of\nworking-hours to twelve, including free hours, or ten hours of actual\nwork a day.  But the ministry did not agree to this.  Sir James Graham\nbegan to threaten resignation from the Cabinet, and at the next vote on\nthe bill the House rejected by a small majority both ten and twelve\nhours!  Graham and Peel now announced that they should introduce a new\nbill, and that if this failed to pass they should resign.  The new bill\nwas exactly the old Twelve Hours' Bill with some changes of form, and the\nsame House of Commons which had rejected the principal points of this\nbill in March, now swallowed it whole.  The reason of this was that most\nof the supporters of the Ten Hours' Bill were Tories who let fall the\nbill rather than the ministry; but be the motives what they may, the\nHouse of Commons by its votes upon this subject, each vote reversing the\nlast, has brought itself into the greatest contempt among all the\nworkers, and proved most brilliantly the Chartists' assertion of the\nnecessity of its reform.  Three members, who had formerly voted against\nthe ministry, afterwards voted for it and rescued it.  In all the\ndivisions, the bulk of the opposition voted _for_ and the bulk of its own\nparty _against_ the ministry. {176}  The foregoing propositions of Graham\ntouching the employment of children six and one-half and of all other\noperatives twelve hours are now legislative provisions, and by them and\nby the limitation of overwork for making up time lost through breakdown\nof machinery or insufficient water-power by reason of frost or drought, a\nworking-day of more than twelve hours has been made well-nigh impossible.\nThere remains, however, no doubt that, in a very short time, the Ten\nHours' Bill will really be adopted.  The manufacturers are naturally all\nagainst it, there are perhaps not ten who are for it; they have used\nevery honourable and dishonourable means against this dreaded measure,\nbut with no other result than that of drawing down upon them the ever\ndeepening hatred of the working-men.  The bill will pass.  What the\nworking-men will do they can do, and that they will have this bill they\nproved last spring.  The economic arguments of the manufacturers that a\nTen Hours' Bill would increase the cost of production and incapacitate\nthe English producers for competition in foreign markets, and that wages\nmust fall, are all _half_ true; but they prove nothing except this, that\nthe industrial greatness of England can be maintained only through the\nbarbarous treatment of the operatives, the destruction of their health,\nthe social, physical, and mental decay of whole generations.  Naturally,\nif the Ten Hours' Bill were a final measure, it must ruin England; but\nsince it must inevitably bring with it other measures which must draw\nEngland into a path wholly different from that hitherto followed, it can\nonly prove an advance.\n\nLet us turn to another side of the factory system which cannot be\nremedied by legislative provisions so easily as the diseases now\nengendered by it.  We have already alluded in a general way to the nature\nof the employment, and enough in detail to be able to draw certain\ninferences from the facts given.  The supervision of machinery, the\njoining of broken threads, is no activity which claims the operative's\nthinking powers, yet it is of a sort which prevents him from occupying\nhis mind with other things.  We have seen, too, that this work affords\nthe muscles no opportunity for physical activity.  Thus it is, properly\nspeaking, not work, but tedium, the most deadening, wearing process\nconceivable.  The operative is condemned to let his physical and mental\npowers decay in this utter monotony, it is his mission to be bored every\nday and all day long from his eighth year.  Moreover, he must not take a\nmoment's rest; the engine moves unceasingly; the wheels, the straps, the\nspindles hum and rattle in his ears without a pause, and if he tries to\nsnatch one instant, there is the overlooker at his back with the book of\nfines.  This condemnation to be buried alive in the mill, to give\nconstant attention to the tireless machine is felt as the keenest torture\nby the operatives, and its action upon mind and body is in the long run\nstunting in the highest degree.  There is no better means of inducing\nstupefaction than a period of factory work, and if the operatives have,\nnevertheless, not only rescued their intelligence, but cultivated and\nsharpened it more than other working-men, they have found this possible\nonly in rebellion against their fate and against the bourgeoisie, the\nsole subject on which under all circumstances they can think and feel\nwhile at work.  Or, if this indignation against the bourgeoisie does not\nbecome the supreme passion of the working-man, the inevitable consequence\nis drunkenness and all that is generally called demoralisation.  The\nphysical enervation and the sickness, universal in consequence of the\nfactory system, were enough to induce Commissioner Hawkins to attribute\nthis demoralisation thereto as inevitable; how much more when mental\nlassitude is added to them, and when the influences already mentioned\nwhich tempt every working-man to demoralisation, make themselves felt\nhere too!  There is no cause for surprise, therefore, that in the\nmanufacturing towns especially, drunkenness and sexual excesses have\nreached the pitch which I have already described. {178}\n\nFurther, the slavery in which the bourgeoisie holds the proletariat\nchained, is nowhere more conspicuous than in the factory system.  Here\nends all freedom in law and in fact.  The operative must be in the mill\nat half-past five in the morning; if he comes a couple of minutes too\nlate, he is fined; if he comes ten minutes too late, he is not let in\nuntil breakfast is over, and a quarter of the day's wages is withheld,\nthough he loses only two and one-half hours' work out of twelve.  He must\neat, drink, and sleep at command.  For satisfying the most imperative\nneeds, he is vouchsafed the least possible time absolutely required by\nthem.  Whether his dwelling is a half-hour or a whole one removed from\nthe factory does not concern his employer.  The despotic bell calls him\nfrom his bed, his breakfast, his dinner.\n\nWhat a time he has of it, too, inside the factory!  Here the employer is\nabsolute law-giver; he makes regulations at will, changes and adds to his\ncodex at pleasure, and even, if he inserts the craziest stuff, the courts\nsay to the working-man: \"You were your own master, no one forced you to\nagree to such a contract if you did not wish to; but now, when you have\nfreely entered into it, you must be bound by it.\"  And so the working-man\nonly gets into the bargain the mockery of the Justice of the Peace who is\na bourgeois himself, and of the law which is made by the bourgeoisie.\nSuch decisions have been given often enough.  In October, 1844, the\noperatives of Kennedy's mill, in Manchester struck.  Kennedy prosecuted\nthem on the strength of a regulation placarded in the mill, that at no\ntime more than two operatives in one room may quit work at once.  And the\ncourt decided in his favour, giving the working-men the explanation cited\nabove. {179a}  And such rules as these usually are!  For instance: 1.  The\ndoors are closed ten minutes after work begins, and thereafter no one is\nadmitted until the breakfast hour; whoever is absent during this time\nforfeits 3d. per loom. 2.  Every power-loom weaver detected absenting\nhimself at another time, while the machinery is in motion, forfeits for\neach hour and each loom, 3d.  Every person who leaves the room during\nworking-hours, without obtaining permission from the overlooker, forfeits\n3d. 3.  Weavers who fail to supply themselves with scissors forfeit, per\nday, 1d. 4.  All broken shuttles, brushes, oil-cans, wheels, window\npanes, etc., must be paid for by the weaver. 5.  No weaver to stop work\nwithout giving a week's notice.  The manufacturer may dismiss any\nemployee without notice for bad work or improper behaviour. 6.  Every\noperative detected speaking to another, singing or whistling, will be\nfined 6d.; for leaving his place during working-hours, 6d. {179b}  Another\ncopy of factory regulations lies before me, according to which every\noperative who comes three minutes too late, forfeits the wages for a\nquarter of an hour, and every one who comes twenty minutes too late, for\na quarter of a day.  Every one who remains absent until breakfast\nforfeits a shilling on Monday, and sixpence every other day of the week,\netc, etc.  This last is the regulation of the Phoenix Works in Jersey\nStreet, Manchester.  It may be said that such rules are necessary in a\ngreat, complicated factory, in order to insure the harmonious working of\nthe different parts; it may be asserted that such a severe discipline is\nas necessary here as in an army.  This may be so, but what sort of a\nsocial order is it which cannot be maintained without such shameful\ntyranny?  Either the end sanctifies the means, or the inference of the\nbadness of the end from the badness of the means is justified.  Every one\nwho has served as a soldier knows what it is to be subjected even for a\nshort time to military discipline.  But these operatives are condemned\nfrom their ninth year to their death to live under the sword, physically\nand mentally.  They are worse slaves than the negroes in America, for\nthey are more sharply watched, and yet it is demanded of them that they\nshall live like human beings, shall think and feel like men!  Verily,\nthis they can do only under glowing hatred towards their oppressors, and\ntowards that order of things which place them in such a position, which\ndegrades them to machines.  But it is far more shameful yet, that\naccording to the universal testimony of the operatives, numbers of\nmanufacturers collect the fines imposed upon the operatives with the most\nheartless severity, and for the purpose of piling up extra profits out of\nthe farthings thus extorted from the impoverished proletarians.  Leach\nasserts, too, that the operatives often find the factory clock moved\nforward a quarter of an hour and the doors shut, while the clerk moves\nabout with the fines-book inside, noting the many names of the absentees.\nLeach claims to have counted ninety-five operatives thus shut out,\nstanding before a factory, whose clock was a quarter of an hour slower\nthan the town clocks at night, and a quarter of an hour faster in the\nmorning.  The Factory Report relates similar facts.  In one factory the\nclock was set back during working-hours, so that the operatives worked\novertime without extra pay; in another, a whole quarter of an hour\novertime was worked; in a third, there were two clocks, an ordinary one\nand a machine clock, which registered the revolutions of the main shaft;\nif the machinery went slowly, working-hours were measured by the machine\nclock until the number of revolutions due in twelve hours was reached; if\nwork went well, so that the number was reached before the usual working-\nhours were ended, the operatives were forced to toil on to the end of the\ntwelfth hour.  The witness adds that he had known girls who had good\nwork, and who had worked overtime, who, nevertheless, betook themselves\nto a life of prostitution rather than submit to this tyranny. {181a}  To\nreturn to the fines, Leach relates having repeatedly seen women in the\nlast period of pregnancy fined 6d. for the offence of sitting down a\nmoment to rest.  Fines for bad work are wholly arbitrary; the goods are\nexamined in the wareroom, and the supervisor charges the fines upon a\nlist without even summoning the operative, who only learns that he has\nbeen fined when the overlooker pays his wages, and the goods have perhaps\nbeen sold, or certainly been placed beyond his reach.  Leach has in his\npossession such a fines list, ten feet long, and amounting to 35 pounds\n17s. 10d.  He relates that in the factory where this list was made, a new\nsupervisor was dismissed for fining too little, and so bringing in five\npounds too little weekly. {181b}  And I repeat that I know Leach to be a\nthoroughly trustworthy man incapable of a falsehood.\n\nBut the operative is his employer's slave in still other respects.  If\nhis wife or daughter finds favour in the eyes of the master, a command, a\nhint suffices, and she must place herself at his disposal.  When the\nemployer wishes to supply with signatures a petition in favour of\nbourgeois interests, he need only send it to his mill.  If he wishes to\ndecide a Parliamentary election, he sends his enfranchised operatives in\nrank and file to the polls, and they vote for the bourgeois candidate\nwhether they will or no.  If he desires a majority in a public meeting,\nhe dismisses them half-an-hour earlier than usual, and secures them\nplaces close to the platform, where he can watch them to his\nsatisfaction.\n\nTwo further arrangements contribute especially to force the operative\nunder the dominion of the manufacturer; the Truck system and the Cottage\nsystem.  The truck system, the payment of the operatives in goods, was\nformerly universal in England.  The manufacturer opens a shop, \"for the\nconvenience of the operatives, and to protect them from the high prices\nof the petty dealers.\"  Here goods of all sorts are sold to them on\ncredit; and to keep the operatives from going to the shops where they\ncould get their goods more cheaply--the \"Tommy shops\" usually charging\ntwenty-five to thirty per cent. more than others--wages are paid in\nrequisitions on the shop instead of money.  The general indignation\nagainst this infamous system led to the passage of the Truck Act in 1831,\nby which, for most employees, payment in truck orders was declared void\nand illegal, and was made punishable by fine; but, like most other\nEnglish laws, this has been enforced only here and there.  In the towns\nit is carried out comparatively efficiently; but in the country, the\ntruck system, disguised or undisguised, flourishes.  In the town of\nLeicester, too, it is very common.  There lie before me nearly a dozen\nconvictions for this offence, dating from the period between November,\n1843, and June, 1844, and reported, in part, in the _Manchester Guardian_\nand, in part, in the _Northern Star_.  The system is, of course, less\nopenly carried on at present; wages are usually paid in cash, but the\nemployer still has means enough at command to force him to purchase his\nwares in the truck shop and nowhere else.  Hence it is difficult to\ncombat the truck system, because it can now be carried on under cover of\nthe law, provided only that the operative receives his wages in money.\nThe _Northern Star_ of April 27th, 1843, publishes a letter from an\noperative of Holmfirth, near Huddersfield, in Yorkshire, which refers to\na manufacturer of the name of Bowers, as follows (retranslated from the\nGerman):\n\n   \"It is very strange to think that the accursed truck system should\n   exist to such an extent as it does in Holmfirth, and nobody be found\n   who has the pluck to make the manufacturer stop it.  There are here a\n   great many honest hand-weavers suffering through this damned system;\n   here is one sample from a good many out of the noble-hearted Free\n   Trade Clique.  There is a manufacturer who has upon himself the curses\n   of the whole district on account of his infamous conduct towards his\n   poor weavers; if they have got a piece ready which comes to 34 or 36\n   shillings, he gives them 20s. in money and the rest in cloth or goods,\n   and 40 to 50 per cent. dearer than at the other shops, and often\n   enough the goods are rotten into the bargain.  But, what says the\n   _Free Trade Mercury_, the _Leeds Mercury_?  They are not bound to take\n   them; they can please themselves.  Oh, yes, but they must take them or\n   else starve.  If they ask for another 20s. in money, they must wait\n   eight or fourteen days for a warp; but if they take the 20s. and the\n   goods, then there is always a warp ready for them.  And that is Free\n   Trade.  Lord Brougham said we ought to put by something in our young\n   days, so that we need not go to the parish when we are old.  Well, are\n   we to put by the rotten goods?  If this did not come from a lord, one\n   would say his brains were as rotten as the goods that our work is paid\n   in.  When the unstamped papers came out \"illegally,\" there was a lot\n   of them to report it to the police in Holmfirth, the Blythes, the\n   Edwards, etc.; but where are they now?  But this is different.  Our\n   truck manufacturer belongs to the pious Free Trade lot; he goes to\n   church twice every Sunday, and repeats devotedly after the parson: 'We\n   have left undone the things we ought to have done, and we have done\n   the things we ought not to have done, and there is no good in us; but,\n   good Lord, deliver us.'  Yes, deliver us till to-morrow, and we will\n   pay our weavers again in rotten goods.\"\n\nThe Cottage system looks much more innocent and arose in a much more\nharmless way, though it has the same enslaving influence upon the\nemployee.  In the neighbourhood of the mills in the country, there is\noften a lack of dwelling accommodation for the operatives.  The\nmanufacturer is frequently obliged to build such dwellings and does so\ngladly, as they yield great advantages, besides the interest upon the\ncapital invested.  If any owner of working-men's dwellings averages about\nsix per cent. on his invested capital, it is safe to calculate that the\nmanufacturer's cottages yield twice this rate; for so long as his factory\ndoes not stand perfectly idle he is sure of occupants, and of occupants\nwho pay punctually.  He is therefore spared the two chief disadvantages\nunder which other house-owners labour; his cottages never stand empty,\nand he runs no risk.  But the rent of the cottages is as high as though\nthese disadvantages were in full force, and by obtaining the same rent as\nthe ordinary house-owner, the manufacturer, at cost of the operatives,\nmakes a brilliant investment at twelve to fourteen per cent.  For it is\nclearly unjust that he should make twice as much profit as other\ncompeting house-owners, who at the same time are excluded from competing\nwith him.  But it implies a double wrong, when he draws his fixed profit\nfrom the pockets of the non-possessing class, which must consider the\nexpenditure of every penny.  He is used to that, however, he whose whole\nwealth is gained at the cost of his employees.  But this injustice\nbecomes an infamy when the manufacturer, as often happens, forces his\noperatives, who must occupy his houses on pain of dismissal, to pay a\nhigher rent than the ordinary one, or even to pay rent for houses in\nwhich they do not live!  The _Halifax Guardian_, quoted by the Liberal\n_Sun_, asserts that hundreds of operatives in Ashton-under-Lyne, Oldham,\nand Rochdale, etc., are forced by their employers to pay house-rent\nwhether they occupy the house or not. {184}  The cottage system is\nuniversal in the country districts; it has created whole villages, and\nthe manufacturer usually has little or no competition against his houses,\nso that he can fix his price regardless of any market rate, indeed at his\npleasure.  And what power does the cottage system give the employer over\nhis operatives in disagreements between master and men?  If the latter\nstrike, he need only give them notice to quit his premises, and the\nnotice need only be a week; after that time the operative is not only\nwithout bread but without a shelter, a vagabond at the mercy of the law\nwhich sends him, without fail, to the treadmill.\n\nSuch is the factory system sketched as fully as my space permits, and\nwith as little partisan spirit as the heroic deeds of the bourgeoisie\nagainst the defenceless workers permit--deeds to wards which it is\nimpossible to remain indifferent, towards which indifference were a\ncrime.  Let us compare the condition of the free Englishman of 1845 with\nthe Saxon serf under the lash of the Norman barons of 1145.  The serf was\n_glebae adscriptus_, bound to the soil, so is the free working-man\nthrough the cottage system.  The serf owed his master the _jus primae\nnoctis_, the right of the first night--the free working-man must, on\ndemand, surrender to his master not only that, but the right of every\nnight.  The serf could acquire no property; everything that he gained,\nhis master could take from him; the free working-man has no property, can\ngain none by reason of the pressure of competition, and what even the\nNorman baron did not do, the modern manufacturer does.  Through the truck\nsystem, he assumes every day the administration in detail of the things\nwhich the worker requires for his immediate necessities.  The relation of\nthe lord of the soil to the serf was regulated by the prevailing customs\nand by-laws which were obeyed, because they corresponded to them.  The\nfree working-man's relation to his master is regulated by laws which are\n_not_ obeyed, because they correspond neither with the interests of the\nemployer nor with the prevailing customs.  The lord of the soil could not\nseparate the serf from the land, nor sell him apart from it, and since\nalmost all the land was fief and there was no capital, practically could\nnot sell him at all.  The modern bourgeois forces the working-man to sell\nhimself.  The serf was the slave of the piece of land on which he was\nborn, the working-man is the slave of his own necessaries of life and of\nthe money with which he has to buy them--both are _slaves of a thing_.\nThe serf had a guarantee for the means of subsistence in the feudal order\nof society in which every member had his own place.  The free working-man\nhas no guarantee whatsoever, because he has a place in society only when\nthe bourgeoisie can make use of him; in all other cases he is ignored,\ntreated as non-existent.  The serf sacrificed himself for his master in\nwar, the factory operative in peace.  The lord of the serf was a\nbarbarian who regarded his villain as a head of cattle; the employer of\noperatives is civilised and regards his \"hand\" as a machine.  In short,\nthe position of the two is not far from equal, and if either is at a\ndisadvantage, it is the free working-man.  Slaves they both are, with the\nsingle difference that the slavery of the one is undissembled, open,\nhonest; that of the other cunning, sly, disguised, deceitfully concealed\nfrom himself and every one else, a hypocritical servitude worse than the\nold.  The philanthropic Tories were right when they gave the operatives\nthe name white slaves.  But the hypocritical disguised slavery recognises\nthe right to freedom, at least in outward form; bows before a freedom-\nloving public opinion, and herein lies the historic progress as compared\nwith the old servitude, that the _principle_ of freedom is affirmed, and\nthe oppressed will one day see to it that this principle is carried out.\n{186}\n\n\n\n\nTHE REMAINING BRANCHES OF INDUSTRY.\n\n\nWe were compelled to deal with the factory system somewhat at length, as\nit is an entirely novel creation of the industrial period; we shall be\nable to treat the other workers the more briefly, because what has been\nsaid either of the industrial proletariat in general, or of the factory\nsystem in particular, will wholly, or in part, apply to them.  We shall,\ntherefore, merely have to record how far the factory system has succeeded\nin forcing its way into each branch of industry, and what other\npeculiarities these may reveal.\n\nThe four branches comprised under the Factory Act are engaged in the\nproduction of clothing stuffs.  We shall do best if we deal next with\nthose workers who receive their materials from these factories; and,\nfirst of all, with the stocking weavers of Nottingham, Derby, and\nLeicester.  Touching these workers, the Children's Employment Commission\nreports that the long working-hours, imposed by low wages, with a\nsedentary life and the strain upon the eyes involved in the nature of the\nemployment, usually enfeeble the whole frame, and especially the eyes.\nWork at night is impossible without a very powerful light produced by\nconcentrating the rays of the lamp, making them pass through glass\nglobes, which is most injurious to the sight.  At forty years of age,\nnearly all wear spectacles.  The children employed at spooling and\nhemming usually suffer grave injuries to the health and constitution.\nThey work from the sixth, seventh, or eighth year ten to twelve hours\ndaily in small, close rooms.  It is not uncommon for them to faint at\ntheir work, to become too feeble for the most ordinary household\noccupation, and so near-sighted as to be obliged to wear glasses during\nchildhood.  Many were found by the commissioners to exhibit all the\nsymptoms of a scrofulous constitution, and the manufacturers usually\nrefuse to employ girls who have worked in this way as being too weak.  The\ncondition of these children is characterised as \"a disgrace to a\nChristian country,\" and the wish expressed for legislative interference.\nThe Factory Report {189} adds that the stocking weavers are the worst\npaid workers in Leicester, earning six, or with great effort, seven\nshillings a week, for sixteen to eighteen hours' daily work.  Formerly\nthey earned twenty to twenty-one shillings, but the introduction of\nenlarged frames has ruined their business; the great majority still work\nwith old, small, single frames, and compete with difficulty with the\nprogress of machinery.  Here, too, every progress is a disadvantage for\nthe workers.  Nevertheless, Commissioner Power speaks of the pride of the\nstocking weavers that they are free, and had no factory bell to measure\nout the time for their eating, sleeping, and working.  Their position to-\nday is no better than in 1833, when the Factory Commission made the\nforegoing statements, the competition of the Saxon stocking weavers, who\nhave scarcely anything to eat, takes care of that.  This competition is\ntoo strong for the English in nearly all foreign markets, and for the\nlower qualities of goods even in the English market.  It must be a source\nof rejoicing for the patriotic German stocking weaver that his starvation\nwages force his English brother to starve too!  And, verily, will he not\nstarve on, proud and happy, for the greater glory of German industry,\nsince the honour of the Fatherland demands that his table should be bare,\nhis dish half empty?  Ah! it is a noble thing this competition, this\n\"race of the nations.\"  In the _Morning Chronicle_, another Liberal\nsheet, the organ of the bourgeoisie par excellence, there were published\nsome letters from a stocking weaver in Hinckley, describing the condition\nof his fellow-workers.  Among other things, he reports 50 families, 321\npersons, who were supported by 109 frames; each frame yielded on an\naverage 5.5 shillings; each family earned an average of 11s. 4d. weekly.\nOut of this there was required for house rent, frame rent, fuel, light,\nsoap, and needles, together 5s. 10d., so that there remained for food,\nper head daily, 1.5d., and for clothing nothing.  \"No eye,\" says the\nstocking weaver, \"has seen, no ear heard, and no heart felt the half of\nthe sufferings that these poor people endure.\"  Beds were wanting either\nwholly or in part, the children ran about ragged and barefoot; the men\nsaid, with tears in their eyes: \"It's a long time since we had any meat;\nwe have almost forgotten how it tastes;\" and, finally, some of them\nworked on Sunday, though public opinion pardons anything else more\nreadily than this, and the rattling noise of the frame is audible\nthroughout the neighbourhood.  \"But,\" said one of them, \"look at my\nchildren and ask no questions.  My poverty forces me to it; I can't and\nwon't hear my children forever crying for bread, without trying the last\nmeans of winning it honestly.  Last Monday I got up at two in the morning\nand worked to near midnight; the other days from six in the morning to\nbetween eleven and twelve at night.  I have had enough of it; I sha'n't\nkill myself; so now I go to bed at ten o'clock, and make up the lost time\non Sundays.\"  Neither in Leicester, Nottingham, nor Derby have wages\nrisen since 1833; and the worst of it is that in Leicester the truck\nsystem prevails to a great extent, as I have mentioned.  It is therefore\nnot to be wondered at that the weavers of this region take a very active\npart in all working-men's movements, the more active and effective\nbecause the frames are worked chiefly by men.\n\nIn this stocking weavers' district the lace industry also has its\nheadquarters.  In the three counties mentioned there are in all 2,760\nlace frames in use, while in all the rest of England there are but 786.\nThe manufacture of lace is greatly complicated by a rigid division of\nlabour, and embraces a multitude of branches.  The yarn is first spooled\nby girls fourteen years of age and upwards, winders; then the spools are\nset up on the frames by boys, eight years old and upwards, threaders, who\npass the thread through fine openings, of which each machine has an\naverage of 1,800, and bring it towards its destination; then the weaver\nweaves the lace which comes out of the machine like a broad piece of\ncloth and is taken apart by very little children who draw out the\nconnecting threads.  This is called running or drawing lace, and the\nchildren themselves lace-runners.  The lace is then made ready for sale.\nThe winders, like the threaders, have no specified working-time, being\ncalled upon whenever the spools on a frame are empty, and are liable,\nsince the weavers work at night, to be required at any time in the\nfactory or workroom.  This irregularity, the frequent night-work, the\ndisorderly way of living consequent upon it, engender a multitude of\nphysical and moral ills, especially early and unbridled sexual licence,\nupon which point all witnesses are unanimous.  The work is very bad for\nthe eyes, and although a permanent injury in the case of the threaders is\nnot universally observable, inflammations of the eye, pain, tears, and\nmomentary uncertainty of vision during the act of threading are\nengendered.  For the winders, however, it is certain that their work\nseriously affects the eye, and produces, besides the frequent\ninflammations of the cornea, many cases of amaurosis and cataract.  The\nwork of the weavers themselves is very difficult, as the frames have\nconstantly been made wider, until those now in use are almost all worked\nby three men in turn, each working eight hours, and the frame being kept\nin use the whole twenty-four.  Hence it is that the winders and threaders\nare so often called upon during the night, and must work to prevent the\nframe from standing idle.  The filling in of 1,800 openings with thread\noccupies three children at least two hours.  Many frames are moved by\nsteam-power, and the work of men thus superseded; and, as the Children's\nEmployment Commission's Report mentions only lace factories to which the\nchildren are summoned, it seems to follow either that the work of the\nweavers has been removed to great factory rooms of late, or that steam-\nweaving has become pretty general; a forward movement of the factory\nsystem in either case.  Most unwholesome of all is the work of the\nrunners, who are usually children of seven, and even of five and four,\nyears old.  Commissioner Grainger actually found one child of two years\nold employed at this work.  Following a thread which is to be withdrawn\nby a needle from an intricate texture, is very bad for the eyes,\nespecially when, as is usually the case, the work is continued fourteen\nto sixteen hours.  In the least unfavourable case, aggravated\nnear-sightedness follows; in the worst case, which is frequent enough,\nincurable blindness from amaurosis.  But, apart from that, the children,\nin consequence of sitting perpetually bent up, become feeble,\nnarrow-chested, and scrofulous from bad digestion.  Disordered functions\nof the uterus are almost universal among the girls, and curvature of the\nspine also, so that \"all the runners may be recognised from their gait.\"\nThe same consequences for the eyes and the whole constitution are\nproduced by the embroidery of lace.  Medical witnesses are unanimously of\nthe opinion that the health of all children employed in the production of\nlace suffers seriously, that they are pale, weak, delicate, undersized,\nand much less able than other children to resist disease.  The affections\nfrom which they usually suffer are general debility, frequent fainting,\npains in the head, sides, back, and hips, palpitation of the heart,\nnausea, vomiting and want of appetite, curvature of the spine, scrofula,\nand consumption.  The health of the female lacemakers especially, is\nconstantly and deeply undermined; complaints are universal of anaemia,\ndifficult childbirth, and miscarriage. {192a}  The same subordinate\nofficial of the Children's Employment Commission reports further that the\nchildren are very often ill-clothed and ragged, and receive insufficient\nfood, usually only bread and tea, often no meat for months together.  As\nto their moral condition, he reports: {192b}\n\n   \"All the inhabitants of Nottingham, the police, the clergy, the\n   manufacturers, the working-people, and the parents of the children are\n   all unanimously of opinion that the present system of labour is a most\n   fruitful source of immorality.  The threaders, chiefly boys, and the\n   winders, usually girls, are called for in the factory at the same\n   time; and as their parents cannot know how long they are wanted there,\n   they have the finest opportunity to form improper connections and\n   remain together after the close of the work.  This has contributed, in\n   no small degree, to the immorality which, according to general\n   opinion, exists to a terrible extent in Nottingham.  Apart from this,\n   the quiet of home life, and the comfort of the family to which these\n   children and young people belong, is wholly sacrificed to this most\n   unnatural state of things.\"\n\nAnother branch of lace-making, bobbin-lacework, is carried on in the\nagricultural shires of Northampton, Oxford, and Bedford, chiefly by\nchildren and young persons, who complain universally of bad food, and\nrarely taste meat.  The employment itself is most unwholesome.  The\nchildren work in small, ill-ventilated, damp rooms, sitting always bent\nover the lace cushion.  To support the body in this wearying position,\nthe girls wear stays with a wooden busk, which, at the tender age of most\nof them, when the bones are still very soft, wholly displace the ribs,\nand make narrow chests universal.  They usually die of consumption after\nsuffering the severest forms of digestive disorders, brought on by\nsedentary work in a bad atmosphere.  They are almost wholly without\neducation, least of all do they receive moral training.  They love\nfinery, and in consequence of these two influences their moral condition\nis most deplorable, and prostitution almost epidemic among them. {193}\n\nThis is the price at which society purchases for the fine ladies of the\nbourgeoisie the pleasure of wearing lace; a reasonable price truly!  Only\na few thousand blind working-men, some consumptive labourers' daughters,\na sickly generation of the vile multitude bequeathing its debility to its\nequally \"vile\" children and children's children.  But what does that come\nto?  Nothing, nothing whatsoever!  Our English bourgeoisie will lay the\nreport of the Government Commission aside indifferently, and wives and\ndaughters will deck themselves with lace as before.  It is a beautiful\nthing, the composure of an English bourgeois.\n\nA great number of operatives are employed in the cotton-printing\nestablishments of Lancashire, Derbyshire, and the West of Scotland.  In\nno branch of English industry has mechanical ingenuity produced such\nbrilliant results as here, but in no other has it so crushed the workers.\nThe application of engraved cylinders driven by steam-power, and the\ndiscovery of a method of printing four to six colours at once with such\ncylinders, has as completely superseded hand-work as did the application\nof machinery to the spinning and weaving of cotton, and these new\narrangements in the printing-works have superseded the hand-workers much\nmore than was the case in the production of the fabrics.  One man, with\nthe assistance of one child, now does with a machine the work done\nformerly by 200 block printers; a single machine yields 28 yards of\nprinted cloth per minute.  The calico printers are in a very bad way in\nconsequence; the shires of Lancaster, Derby, and Chester produced\n(according to a petition of the printers to the House of Commons), in the\nyear 1842, 11,000,000 pieces of printed cotton goods: of these, 100,000\nwere printed by hand exclusively, 900,000 in part with machinery and in\npart by hand, and 10,000,000 by machinery alone, with four to six\ncolours.  As the machinery is chiefly new and undergoes constant\nimprovement, the number of hand-printers is far too great for the\navailable quantity of work, and many of them are therefore starving; the\npetition puts the number at one-quarter of the whole, while the rest are\nemployed but one or two, in the best case three days in the week, and are\nill-paid.  Leach {194} asserts of one print-work (Deeply Dale, near Bury,\nin Lancashire), that the hand-printers did not earn on an average more\nthan five shillings, though he knows that the machine-printers were\npretty well paid.  The print-works are thus wholly affiliated with the\nfactory system, but without being subject to the legislative restrictions\nplaced upon it.  They produce an article subject to fashion, and have\ntherefore no regular work.  If they have small orders, they work half\ntime; if they make a hit with a pattern, and business is brisk, they work\ntwelve hours, perhaps all night.  In the neighbourhood of my home, near\nManchester, there was a print-work that was often lighted when I returned\nlate at night; and I have heard that the children were obliged at times\nto work so long there, that they would try to catch a moment's rest and\nsleep on the stone steps and in the corners of the lobby.  I have no\nlegal proof of the truth of the statement, or I should name the firm.  The\nReport of the Children's Employment Commission is very cursory upon this\nsubject, stating merely that in England, at least, the children are\nmostly pretty well clothed and fed (relatively, according to the wages of\nthe parents), that they receive no education whatsoever, and are morally\non a low plane.  It is only necessary to remember that these children are\nsubject to the factory system, and then, referring the reader to what has\nalready been said of that, we can pass on.\n\nOf the remaining workers employed in the manufacture of clothing stuffs\nlittle remains to be said; the bleachers' work is very unwholesome,\nobliging them to breathe chlorine, a gas injurious to the lungs.  The\nwork of the dyers is in many cases very healthful, since it requires the\nexertion of the whole body; how these workers are paid is little known,\nand this is ground enough for the inference that they do not receive less\nthan the average wages, otherwise they would make complaint.  The fustian\ncutters, who, in consequence of the large consumption of cotton velvet,\nare comparatively numerous, being estimated at from 3,000 to 4,000, have\nsuffered very severely, indirectly, from the influence of the factory\nsystem.  The goods formerly woven with hand-looms, were not perfectly\nuniform, and required a practised hand in cutting the single rows of\nthreads.  Since power-looms have been used, the rows run regularly; each\nthread of the weft is exactly parallel with the preceding one, and\ncutting is no longer an art.  The workers thrown out of employment by the\nintroduction of machinery turn to fustian cutting, and force down wages\nby their competition; the manufacturers discovered that they could employ\nwomen and children, and the wages sank to the rate paid them, while\nhundreds of men were thrown out of employment.  The manufacturers found\nthat they could get the work done in the factory itself more cheaply than\nin the cutters' workroom, for which they indirectly paid the rent.  Since\nthis discovery, the low upper-storey cutters' rooms stand empty in many a\ncottage, or are let for dwellings, while the cutter has lost his freedom\nof choice of his working-hours, and is brought under the dominion of the\nfactory bell.  A cutter of perhaps forty-five years of age told me that\nhe could remember a time when he had received 8d. a yard for work, for\nwhich he now received 1d.; true, he can cut the more regular texture more\nquickly than the old, but he can by no means do twice as much in an hour\nas formerly, so that his wages have sunk to less than a quarter of what\nthey were.  Leach {196} gives a list of wages paid in 1827 and in 1843\nfor various goods, from which it appears that articles paid in 1827 at\nthe rates of 4d., 2.25d., 2.75d., and 1d. per yard, were paid in 1843 at\nthe rate of 1.5d., 1d., .75d., and 0.375d. per yard, cutters' wages.  The\naverage weekly wage, according to Leach, was as follows: 1827, 1 pounds\n6s. 6d.; 1 pounds 2s. 6d.; 1 pounds; 1 pounds 6s. 6d.; and for the same\ngoods in 1843, 10s. 6d.; 7s. 6d.; 6s. 8d.; 10s.; while there are hundreds\nof workers who cannot find employment even at these last named rates.  Of\nthe hand-weavers of the cotton industry we have already spoken; the other\nwoven fabrics are almost exclusively produced on hand-looms.  Here most\nof the workers have suffered as the weavers have done from the crowding\nin of competitors displaced by machinery, and are, moreover, subject like\nthe factory operatives to a severe fine system for bad work.  Take, for\ninstance, the silk weavers.  Mr. Brocklehurst, one of the largest silk\nmanufacturers in all England, laid before a committee of members of\nParliament lists taken from his books, from which it appears that for\ngoods for which he paid wages in 1821 at the rate of 30s., 14s., 3.5s.,\n.75s., 1.5s., 10s., he paid in 1839 but 9s., 7.25s., 2.25s., 0.333s.,\n0.5s., 6.25s., while in this case no improvement in the machinery has\ntaken place.  But what Mr. Brocklehurst does may very well be taken as a\nstandard for all.  From the same lists it appears that the average weekly\nwage of his weavers, after all deductions, was, in 1821, 16.5s., and, in\n1831, but 6s.  Since that time wages have fallen still further.  Goods\nwhich brought in 4d. weavers' wages in 1831, bring in but 2.5d. in 1843\n(single sarsnets), and a great number of weavers in the country can get\nwork only when they undertake these goods at 1.5d.-2d.  Moreover, they\nare subject to arbitrary deductions from their wages.  Every weaver who\nreceives materials is given a card, on which is usually to be read that\nthe work is to be returned at a specified hour of the day; that a weaver\nwho cannot work by reason of illness must make the fact known at the\noffice within three days, or sickness will not be regarded as an excuse;\nthat it will not be regarded as a sufficient excuse if the weaver claims\nto have been obliged to wait for yarn; that for certain faults in the\nwork (if, for example, more weft-threads are found within a given space\nthan are prescribed), not less than half the wages will be deducted; and\nthat if the goods should not be ready at the time specified, one penny\nwill be deducted for every yard returned.  The deductions in accordance\nwith these cards are so considerable that, for instance, a man who comes\ntwice a week to Leigh, in Lancashire, to gather up woven goods, brings\nhis employer at least 15 pound fines every time.  He asserts this\nhimself, and he is regarded as one of the most lenient.  Such things were\nformerly settled by arbitration; but as the workers were usually\ndismissed if they insisted upon that, the custom has been almost wholly\nabandoned, and the manufacturer acts arbitrarily as prosecutor, witness,\njudge, law-giver, and executive in one person.  And if the workman goes\nto a Justice of the Peace, the answer is: \"When you accepted your card\nyou entered upon a contract, and you must abide by it.\"  The case is the\nsame as that of the factory operatives.  Besides, the employer obliges\nthe workman to sign a document in which he declares that he agrees to the\ndeductions made.  And if a workman rebels, all the manufacturers in the\ntown know at once that he is a man who, as Leach says, {197} \"resists the\nlawful order as established by weavers' cards, and, moreover, has the\nimpudence to doubt the wisdom of those who are, as he ought to know, his\nsuperiors in society.\"\n\nNaturally, the workers are perfectly free; the manufacturer does not\nforce them to take his materials and his cards, but he says to them what\nLeach translates into plain English with the words: \"If you don't like to\nbe frizzled in my frying-pan, you can take a walk into the fire.\"  The\nsilk weavers of London, and especially of Spitalfields, have lived in\nperiodic distress for a long time, and that they still have no cause to\nbe satisfied with their lot is proved by their taking a most active part\nin English labour movements in general, and in London ones in particular.\nThe distress prevailing among them gave rise to the fever which broke out\nin East London, and called forth the Commission for Investigating the\nSanitary Condition of the Labouring Class.  But the last report of the\nLondon Fever Hospital shows that this disease is still raging.\n\nAfter the textile fabrics, by far the most important products of English\nindustry are the metal-wares.  This trade has its headquarters at\nBirmingham, where the finer metal goods of all sorts are produced, at\nSheffield for cutlery, and in Staffordshire, especially at Wolverhampton,\nwhere the coarser articles, locks, nails, etc., are manufactured.  In\ndescribing the position of the workers employed in these trades, let us\nbegin with Birmingham.  The disposition of the work has retained in\nBirmingham, as in most places where metals are wrought, something of the\nold handicraft character; the small employers are still to be found, who\nwork with their apprentices in the shop at home, or when they need steam-\npower, in great factory buildings which are divided into little shops,\neach rented to a small employer, and supplied with a shaft moved by the\nengine, and furnishing motive power for the machinery.  Leon Faucher,\nauthor of a series of articles in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_, which at\nleast betray study, and are better than what has hitherto been written\nupon the subject by Englishmen or Germans, characterises this relation in\ncontrast with the manufacture of Lancashire as \"Democratie industrielle,\"\nand observes that it produces no very favourable results for master or\nmen.  This observation is perfectly correct, for the many small employers\ncannot well subsist on the profit divided amongst them, determined by\ncompetition, a profit under other circumstances absorbed by a single\nmanufacturer.  The centralising tendency of capital holds them down.  For\none who grows rich ten are ruined, and a hundred placed at a greater\ndisadvantage than ever, by the pressure of the one upstart who can afford\nto sell more cheaply than they.  And in the cases where they have to\ncompete from the beginning against great capitalists, it is self-evident\nthat they can only toil along with the greatest difficulty.  The\napprentices are, as we shall see, quite as badly off under the small\nemployers as under the manufacturers, with the single difference that\nthey, in turn, may become small employers, and so attain a certain\nindependence--that is to say, they are at best less directly exploited by\nthe bourgeoisie than under the factory system.  Thus these small\nemployers are neither genuine proletarians, since they live in part upon\nthe work of their apprentices, nor genuine bourgeois, since their\nprincipal means of support is their own work.  This peculiar midway\nposition of the Birmingham iron-workers is to blame for their having so\nrarely joined wholly and unreservedly in the English labour movements.\nBirmingham is a politically radical, but not a Chartist, town.  There\nare, however, numerous larger factories belonging to capitalists; and in\nthese the factory system reigns supreme.  The division of labour, which\nis here carried out to the last detail (in the needle industry, for\nexample), and the use of steam-power, admit of the employment of a great\nmultitude of women and children, and we find here {199} precisely the\nsame features reappearing which the Factories' Report presented,--the\nwork of women up to the hour of confinement, incapacity as housekeepers,\nneglect of home and children, indifference, actual dislike to family\nlife, and demoralisation; further, the crowding out of men from\nemployment, the constant improvement of machinery, early emancipation of\nchildren, husbands supported by their wives and children, etc. etc.  The\nchildren are described as half-starved and ragged, the half of them are\nsaid not to know what it is to have enough to eat, many of them get\nnothing to eat before the midday meal, or even live the whole day upon a\npennyworth of bread for a noonday meal--there were actually cases in\nwhich children received no food from eight in the morning until seven at\nnight.  Their clothing is very often scarcely sufficient to cover their\nnakedness, many are barefoot even in winter.  Hence they are all small\nand weak for their age, and rarely develop with any degree of vigour.  And\nwhen we reflect that with these insufficient means of reproducing the\nphysical forces, hard and protracted work in close rooms is required of\nthem, we cannot wonder that there are few adults in Birmingham fit for\nmilitary service.  \"The working men,\" says a recruiting surgeon, \"are\nsmall, delicate, and of very slight physical power; many of them\ndeformed, too, in the chest or spinal column.\"  According to the\nassertion of a recruiting sergeant, the people of Birmingham are smaller\nthan those anywhere else, being usually 5 feet 4 to 5 inches tall; out of\n613 recruits, but 238 were found fit for service.  As to education, a\nseries of depositions and specimens taken from the metal districts have\nalready been given, {200a} to which the reader is referred.  It appears\nfurther, from the Children's Employment Commission's Report, that in\nBirmingham more than half the children between five and fifteen years\nattend no school whatsoever, that those who do are constantly changing,\nso that it is impossible to give them any training of an enduring kind,\nand that they are all withdrawn from school very early and set to work.\nThe report makes it clear what sort of teachers are employed.  One\nteacher, in answer to the question whether she gave moral instruction,\nsaid, No, for threepence a week school fees that was too much to require,\nbut that she took a great deal of trouble to instil good principles into\nthe children.  (And she made a decided slip in her English in saying it.)\nIn the schools the commissioner found constant noise and disorder.  The\nmoral state of the children is in the highest degree deplorable.  Half of\nall the criminals are children under fifteen, and in a single year ninety\nten-years'-old offenders, among them forty-four serious criminal cases,\nwere sentenced.  Unbridled sexual intercourse seems, according to the\nopinion of the commissioner, almost universal, and that at a very early\nage. {200b}\n\nIn the iron district of Staffordshire the state of things is still worse.\nFor the coarse wares made here neither much division of labour (with\ncertain exceptions) nor steam-power or machinery can be applied.  In\nWolverhampton, Willenhall, Bilston, Sedgeley, Wednesfield, Darlaston,\nDudley, Walsall, Wednesbury, etc., there are, therefore, fewer factories,\nbut chiefly single forges, where the small masters work alone, or with\none or more apprentices, who serve them until reaching the twenty-first\nyear.  The small employers are in about the same situation as those of\nBirmingham; but the apprentices, as a rule, are much worse off.  They get\nalmost exclusively meat from diseased animals or such as have died a\nnatural death, or tainted meat, or fish to eat, with veal from calves\nkilled too young, and pork from swine smothered during transportation,\nand such food is furnished not by small employers only, but by large\nmanufacturers, who employ from thirty to forty apprentices.  The custom\nseems to be universal in Wolverhampton, and its natural consequence is\nfrequent bowel complaints and other diseases.  Moreover, the children\nusually do not get enough to eat, and have rarely other clothing than\ntheir working rags, for which reason, if for no other, they cannot go to\nSunday school The dwellings are bad and filthy, often so much so that\nthey give rise to disease; and in spite of the not materially unhealthy\nwork, the children are puny, weak, and, in many cases, severely crippled.\nIn Willenhall, for instance, there are countless persons who have, from\nperpetually filing at the lathe, crooked backs and one leg crooked, \"hind-\nleg\" as they call it, so that the two legs have the form of a K; while it\nis said that more than one-third of the working-men there are ruptured.\nHere, as well as in Wolverhampton, numberless cases were found of\nretarded puberty among girls, (for girls, too, work at the forges,) as\nwell as among boys, extending even to the nineteenth year.  In Sedgeley\nand its surrounding district, where nails form almost the sole product,\nthe nailers live and work in the most wretched stable-like huts, which\nfor filth can scarcely be equalled.  Girls and boys work from the tenth\nor twelfth year, and are accounted fully skilled only when they make a\nthousand nails a day.  For twelve hundred nails the pay is 5.75d.  Every\nnail receives twelve blows, and since the hammer weighs 1.25 pounds, the\nnailer must lift 18,000 pounds to earn this miserable pay.  With this\nhard work and insufficient food, the children inevitably develop\nill-formed, undersized frames, and the commissioners depositions confirm\nthis.  As to the state of education in this district, data have already\nbeen furnished in the foregoing chapters.  It is upon an incredibly low\nplane; half the children do not even go to Sunday school, and the other\nhalf go irregularly; very few, in comparison with the other districts,\ncan read, and in the matter of writing the case is much worse.  Naturally,\nfor between the seventh and tenth years, just when they are beginning to\nget some good out of going to school, they are set to work, and the\nSunday school teachers, smiths or miners, frequently cannot read, and\nwrite their names with difficulty.  The prevailing morals correspond with\nthese means of education.  In Willenhall, Commissioner Horne asserts, and\nsupplies ample proofs of his assertion, that there exists absolutely no\nmoral sense among the workers.  In general, he found that the children\nneither recognised duties to their parents nor felt any affection for\nthem.  They were so little capable of thinking of what they said, so\nstolid, so hopelessly stupid, that they often asserted that they were\nwell treated, were coming on famously, when they were forced to work\ntwelve to fourteen hours, were clad in rags, did not get enough to eat,\nand were beaten so that they felt it several days afterwards.  They knew\nnothing of a different kind of life than that in which they toil from\nmorning until they are allowed to stop at night, and did not even\nunderstand the question never heard before, whether they were tired.\n{202}\n\nIn Sheffield wages are better, and the external state of the workers\nalso.  On the other hand, certain branches of work are to be noticed\nhere, because of their extraordinarily injurious influence upon health.\nCertain operations require the constant pressure of tools against the\nchest, and engender consumption in many cases; others, file-cutting among\nthem, retard the general development of the body and produce digestive\ndisorders; bone-cutting for knife handles brings with it headache,\nbiliousness, and among girls, of whom many are employed, anaemia.  By far\nthe most unwholesome work is the grinding of knife-blades and forks,\nwhich, especially when done with a dry stone, entails certain early\ndeath.  The unwholesomeness of this work lies in part in the bent\nposture, in which chest and stomach are cramped; but especially in the\nquantity of sharp-edged metal dust particles freed in the cutting, which\nfill the atmosphere, and are necessarily inhaled.  The dry grinders'\naverage life is hardly thirty-five years, the wet grinders' rarely\nexceeds forty-five.  Dr. Knight, in Sheffield, says: {203}\n\n   \"I can convey some idea of the injuriousness of this occupation only\n   by asserting that the hardest drinkers among the grinders are the\n   longest lived among them, because they are longest and oftenest absent\n   from their work.  There are, in all, some 2,500 grinders in Sheffield.\n   About 150 (80 men and 70 boys) are fork grinders; these die between\n   the twenty-eighth and thirty-second years of age.  The razor grinders,\n   who grind wet as well as dry, die between forty and forty-five years,\n   and the table cutlery grinders, who grind wet, die between the\n   fortieth and fiftieth year.\"\n\nThe same physician gives the following description of the course of the\ndisease called grinders' asthma:\n\n   \"They usually begin their work with the fourteenth year, and, if they\n   have good constitutions, rarely notice any symptoms before the\n   twentieth year.  Then the symptoms of their peculiar disease appear.\n   They suffer from shortness of breath at the slightest effort in going\n   up hill or up stairs, they habitually raise the shoulders to relieve\n   the permanent and increasing want of breath; they bend forward, and\n   seem, in general, to feel most comfortable in the crouching position\n   in which they work.  Their complexion becomes dirty yellow, their\n   features express anxiety, they complain of pressure upon the chest.\n   Their voices become rough and hoarse, they cough loudly, and the sound\n   is as if air were driven through a wooden tube.  From time to time\n   they expectorate considerable quantities of dust, either mixed with\n   phlegm or in balls or cylindrical masses, with a thin coating of\n   mucus.  Spitting blood, inability to lie down, night sweat,\n   colliquative diarrhoea, unusual loss of flesh, and all the usual\n   symptoms of consumption of the lungs finally carry them off, after\n   they have lingered months, or even years, unfit to support themselves\n   or those dependent upon them.  I must add that all attempts which have\n   hitherto been made to prevent grinders' asthma, or to cure it, have\n   wholly failed.\"\n\nAll this Knight wrote ten years ago; since then the number of grinders\nand the violence of the disease have increased, though attempts have been\nmade to prevent it by covered grindstones and carrying off the dust by\nartificial draught.  These methods have been at least partially\nsuccessful, but the grinders do not desire their adoption, and have even\ndestroyed the contrivance here and there, in the belief that more workers\nmay be attracted to the business and wages thus reduced; they are for a\nshort life and a merry one.  Dr. Knight has often told grinders who came\nto him with the first symptoms of asthma that a return to grinding means\ncertain death, but with no avail.  He who is once a grinder falls into\ndespair, as though he had sold himself to the devil.  Education in\nSheffield is upon a very low plane; a clergyman, who had occupied himself\nlargely with the statistics of education, was of the opinion that of\n16,500 children of the working-class who are in a position to attend\nschool, scarcely 6,500 can read.  This comes of the fact that the\nchildren are taken from school in the seventh, and, at the very latest,\nin the twelfth year, and that the teachers are good for nothing; one was\na convicted thief who found no other way of supporting himself after\nbeing released from jail than teaching school!  Immorality among young\npeople seems to be more prevalent in Sheffield than anywhere else.  It is\nhard to tell which town ought to have the prize, and in reading the\nreport one believes of each one that this certainly deserves it!  The\nyounger generation spend the whole of Sunday lying in the street tossing\ncoins or fighting dogs, go regularly to the gin palace, where they sit\nwith their sweethearts until late at night, when they take walks in\nsolitary couples.  In an ale-house which the commissioner visited, there\nsat forty to fifty young people of both sexes, nearly all under seventeen\nyears of age, and each lad beside his lass.  Here and there cards were\nplayed, at other places dancing was going on, and everywhere drinking.\nAmong the company were openly avowed professional prostitutes.  No\nwonder, then, that, as all the witnesses testify, early, unbridled sexual\nintercourse, youthful prostitution, beginning with persons of fourteen to\nfifteen years, is extraordinarily frequent in Sheffield.  Crimes of a\nsavage and desperate sort are of common occurrence; one year before the\ncommissioner's visit, a band, consisting chiefly of young persons, was\narrested when about to set fire to the town, being fully equipped with\nlances and inflammable substances.  We shall see later that the labour\nmovement in Sheffield has this same savage character. {205}\n\nBesides these two main centres of the metal industry, there are needle\nfactories in Warrington, Lancashire, where great want, immorality, and\nignorance prevail among the workers, and especially among the children;\nand a number of nail forges in the neighbourhood of Wigan, in Lancashire,\nand in the east of Scotland.  The reports from these latter districts\ntell almost precisely the same story as those of Staffordshire.  There is\none more branch of this industry carried on in the factory districts,\nespecially in Lancashire, the essential peculiarity of which is the\nproduction of machinery by machinery, whereby the workers, crowded out\nelsewhere, are deprived of their last refuge, the creation of the very\nenemy which supersedes them.  Machinery for planing and boring, cutting\nscrews, wheels, nuts, etc., with power lathes, has thrown out of\nemployment a multitude of men who formerly found regular work at good\nwages; and whoever wishes to do so may see crowds of them in Manchester.\n\nNorth of the iron district of Staffordshire lies an industrial region to\nwhich we shall now turn our attention, the Potteries, whose headquarters\nare in the borough of Stoke, embracing Henley, Burslem, Lane End, Lane\nDelph, Etruria, Coleridge, Langport, Tunstall, and Golden Hill,\ncontaining together 60,000 inhabitants.  The Children's Employment\nCommission reports upon this subject that in some branches of this\nindustry, in the production of stoneware, the children have light\nemployment in warm, airy rooms; in others, on the contrary, hard, wearing\nlabour is required, while they receive neither sufficient food nor good\nclothing.  Many children complain: \"Don't get enough to eat, get mostly\npotatoes with salt, never meat, never bread, don't go to school, haven't\ngot no clothes.\"  \"Haven't got nothin' to eat to-day for dinner, don't\nnever have dinner at home, get mostly potatoes and salt, sometimes\nbread.\"  \"These is all the clothes I have, no Sunday suit at home.\"  Among\nthe children whose work is especially injurious are the mould-runners,\nwho have to carry the moulded article with the form to the drying-room,\nand afterwards bring back the empty form, when the article is properly\ndried.  Thus they must go to and fro the whole day, carrying burdens\nheavy in proportion to their age, while the high temperature in which\nthey have to do this increases very considerably the exhaustiveness of\nthe work.  These children, with scarcely a single exception, are lean,\npale, feeble, stunted; nearly all suffer from stomach troubles, nausea,\nwant of appetite, and many of them die of consumption.  Almost as\ndelicate are the boys called \"jiggers,\" from the \"jigger\" wheel which\nthey turn.  But by far the most injurious is the work of those who dip\nthe finished article into a fluid containing great quantities of lead,\nand often of arsenic, or have to take the freshly-dipped article up with\nthe hand.  The hands and clothing of these workers, adults and children,\nare always wet with this fluid, the skin softens and falls off under the\nconstant contact with rough objects, so that the fingers often bleed, and\nare constantly in a state most favourable for the absorption of this\ndangerous substance.  The consequence is violent pain, and serious\ndisease of the stomach and intestines, obstinate constipation, colic,\nsometimes consumption, and, most common of all, epilepsy among children.\nAmong men, partial paralysis of the hand muscles, colica pictorum, and\nparalysis of whole limbs are ordinary phenomena.  One witness relates\nthat two children who worked with him died of convulsions at their work;\nanother who had helped with the dipping two years while a boy, relates\nthat he had violent pains in the bowels at first, then convulsions, in\nconsequence of which he was confined to his bed two months, since when\nthe attacks of convulsions have increased in frequency, are now daily,\naccompanied often by ten to twenty epileptic fits, his right arm is\nparalysed, and the physicians tell him that he can never regain the use\nof his limbs.  In one factory were found in the dipping-house four men,\nall epileptic and afflicted with severe colic, and eleven boys, several\nof whom were already epileptic.  In short, this frightful disease follows\nthis occupation universally: and that, too, to the greater pecuniary\nprofit of the bourgeoisie!  In the rooms in which the stoneware is\nscoured, the atmosphere is filled with pulverised flint, the breathing of\nwhich is as injurious as that of the steel dust among the Sheffield\ngrinders.  The workers lose breath, cannot lie down, suffer from sore\nthroat and violent coughing, and come to have so feeble a voice that they\ncan scarcely be heard.  They, too, all die of consumption.  In the\nPotteries district, the schools are said to be comparatively numerous,\nand to offer the children opportunities for instruction; but as the\nlatter are so early set to work for twelve hours and often more per day,\nthey are not in a position to avail themselves of the schools, so that\nthree-fourths of the children examined by the commissioner could neither\nread nor write, while the whole district is plunged in the deepest\nignorance.  Children who have attended Sunday school for years could not\ntell one letter from another, and the moral and religious education, as\nwell as the intellectual, is on a very low plane. {207}\n\nIn the manufacture of glass, too, work occurs which seems little\ninjurious to men, but cannot be endured by children.  The hard labour,\nthe irregularity of the hours, the frequent night-work, and especially\nthe great heat of the working place (100 to 130 Fahrenheit), engender in\nchildren general debility and disease, stunted growth, and especially\naffections of the eye, bowel complaint, and rheumatic and bronchial\naffections.  Many of the children are pale, have red eyes, often blind\nfor weeks at a time, suffer from violent nausea, vomiting, coughs, colds,\nand rheumatism.  When the glass is withdrawn from the fire, the children\nmust often go into such heat that the boards on which they stand catch\nfire under their feet.  The glassblowers usually die young of debility\nand chest affections. {208}\n\nAs a whole, this report testifies to the gradual but sure introduction of\nthe factory system into all branches of industry, recognisable especially\nby the employment of women and children.  I have not thought it necessary\nto trace in every case the progress of machinery and the superseding of\nmen as workers.  Every one who is in any degree acquainted with the\nnature of manufacture can fill this out for himself, while space fails me\nto describe in detail an aspect of our present system of production, the\nresult of which I have already sketched in dealing with the factory\nsystem.  In all directions machinery is being introduced, and the last\ntrace of the working-man's independence thus destroyed.  In all\ndirections the family is being dissolved by the labour of wife and\nchildren, or inverted by the husband's being thrown out of employment and\nmade dependent upon them for bread; everywhere the inevitable machinery\nbestows upon the great capitalist command of trade and of the workers\nwith it.  The centralisation of capital strides forward without\ninterruption, the division of society into great capitalists and\nnon-possessing workers is sharper every day, the industrial development\nof the nation advances with giant strides towards the inevitable crisis.\n\nI have already stated that in the handicrafts the power of capital, and\nin some cases the division of labour too, has produced the same results,\ncrushed the small tradesmen, and put great capitalists and non-possessing\nworkers in their place.  As to these handicraftsmen there is little to be\nsaid, since all that relates to them has already found its place where\nthe proletariat in general was under discussion.  There has been but\nlittle change here in the nature of the work and its influence upon\nhealth since the beginning of the industrial movement.  But the constant\ncontact with the factory operatives, the pressure of the great\ncapitalists, which is much more felt than that of the small employer to\nwhom the apprentice still stood in a more or less personal relation, the\ninfluences of life in towns, and the fall of wages, have made nearly all\nthe handicraftsmen active participators in labour movements.  We shall\nsoon have more to say on this point, and turn meanwhile to one section of\nworkers in London who deserve our attention by reason of the\nextraordinary barbarity with which they are exploited by the money-greed\nof the bourgeoisie.  I mean the dressmakers and sewing-women.\n\nIt is a curious fact that the production of precisely those articles\nwhich serve the personal adornment of the ladies of the bourgeoisie\ninvolves the saddest consequences for the health of the workers.  We have\nalready seen this in the case of the lacemakers, and come now to the\ndressmaking establishments of London for further proof.  They employ a\nmass of young girls--there are said to be 15,000 of them in all--who\nsleep and eat on the premises, come usually from the country, and are\ntherefore absolutely the slaves of their employers.  During the\nfashionable season, which lasts some four months, working-hours, even in\nthe best establishments, are fifteen, and, in very pressing cases,\neighteen a day; but in most shops work goes on at these times without any\nset regulation, so that the girls never have more than six, often not\nmore than three or four, sometimes, indeed, not more than two hours in\nthe twenty-four, for rest and sleep, working nineteen to twenty hours, if\nnot the whole night through, as frequently happens!  The only limit set\nto their work is the absolute physical inability to hold the needle\nanother minute.  Cases have occurred in which these helpless creatures\ndid not undress during nine consecutive days and nights, and could only\nrest a moment or two here and there upon a mattress, where food was\nserved them ready cut up in order to require the least possible time for\nswallowing.  In short, these unfortunate girls are kept by means of the\nmoral whip of the modern slave-driver, the threat of discharge, to such\nlong and unbroken toil as no strong man, much less a delicate girl of\nfourteen to twenty years, can endure.  In addition to this, the foul air\nof the workroom and sleeping places, the bent posture, the often bad and\nindigestible food, all these causes, combined with almost total exclusion\nfrom fresh air, entail the saddest consequences for the health of the\ngirls.  Enervation, exhaustion, debility, loss of appetite, pains in the\nshoulders, back, and hips, but especially headache, begin very soon; then\nfollow curvatures of the spine, high, deformed shoulders, leanness,\nswelled, weeping, and smarting eyes, which soon become short-sighted;\ncoughs, narrow chests, and shortness of breath, and all manner of\ndisorders in the development of the female organism.  In many cases the\neyes suffer, so severely that incurable blindness follows; but if the\nsight remains strong enough to make continued work possible, consumption\nusually soon ends the sad life of these milliners and dressmakers.  Even\nthose who leave this work at an early age retain permanently injured\nhealth, a broken constitution; and, when married, bring feeble and sickly\nchildren into the world.  All the medical men interrogated by the\ncommissioner agreed that no method of life could be invented better\ncalculated to destroy health and induce early death.\n\nWith the same cruelty, though somewhat more indirectly, the rest of the\nneedle-women of London are exploited.  The girls employed in stay-making\nhave a hard, wearing occupation, trying to the eyes.  And what wages do\nthey get?  I do not know; but this I know, that the middle-man who has to\ngive security for the material delivered, and who distributes the work\namong the needle-women, receives 1.5d. per piece.  From this he deducts\nhis own pay, at least .5d., so that 1d. at most reaches the pocket of the\ngirl.  The girls who sew neckties must bind themselves to work sixteen\nhours a day, and receive 4.5s. a week. {210}  But the shirtmakers' lot is\nthe worst.  They receive for an ordinary shirt 1.5d., formerly 2d.-3d.;\nbut since the workhouse of St. Pancras, which is administered by a\nRadical board of guardians, began to undertake work at 1.5d., the poor\nwomen outside have been compelled to do the same.  For fine, fancy\nshirts, which can be made in one day of eighteen hours, 6d. is paid.  The\nweekly wage of these sewing-women according to this and according to\ntestimony from many sides, including both needle-women and employers, is\n2s. 6d. to 3s. for most strained work continued far into the night.  And\nwhat crowns this shameful barbarism is the fact that the women must give\na money deposit for a part of the materials entrusted to them, which they\nnaturally cannot do unless they pawn a part of them (as the employers\nvery well know), redeeming them at a loss; or if they cannot redeem the\nmaterials, they must appear before a Justice of the Peace, as happened a\nsewing-woman in November, 1843.  A poor girl who got into this strait and\ndid not know what to do next, drowned herself in a canal in 1844.  These\nwomen usually live in little garret rooms in the utmost distress, where\nas many crowd together as the space can possibly admit, and where, in\nwinter, the animal warmth of the workers is the only heat obtainable.\nHere they sit bent over their work, sewing from four or five in the\nmorning until midnight, destroying their health in a year or two and\nending in an early grave, without being able to obtain the poorest\nnecessities of life meanwhile. {211}  And below them roll the brilliant\nequipages of the upper bourgeoisie, and perhaps ten steps away some\npitiable dandy loses more money in one evening at faro than they can earn\nin a year.\n\n* * * * *\n\nSuch is the condition of the English manufacturing proletariat.  In all\ndirections, whithersoever we may turn, we find want and disease permanent\nor temporary, and demoralisation arising from the condition of the\nworkers; in all directions slow but sure undermining, and final\ndestruction of the human being physically as well as mentally.  Is this a\nstate of things which can last?  It cannot and will not last.  The\nworkers, the great majority of the nation, will not endure it.  Let us\nsee what they say of it.\n\n\n\n\nLABOUR MOVEMENTS.\n\n\nIt must be admitted, even if I had not proved it so often in detail, that\nthe English workers cannot feel happy in this condition; that theirs is\nnot a state in which a man or a whole class of men can think, feel, and\nlive as human beings.  The workers must therefore strive to escape from\nthis brutalizing condition, to secure for themselves a better, more human\nposition; and this they cannot do without attacking the interest of the\nbourgeoisie which consists in exploiting them.  But the bourgeoisie\ndefends its interests with all the power placed at its disposal by wealth\nand the might of the State.  In proportion as the working-man determines\nto alter the present state of things, the bourgeois becomes his avowed\nenemy.\n\nMoreover, the working-man is made to feel at every moment that the\nbourgeoisie treats him as a chattel, as its property, and for this\nreason, if for no other, he must come forward as its enemy.  I have shown\nin a hundred ways in the foregoing pages, and could have shown in a\nhundred others, that, in our present society, he can save his manhood\nonly in hatred and rebellion against the bourgeoisie.  And he can protest\nwith most violent passion against the tyranny of the propertied class,\nthanks to his education, or rather want of education, and to the\nabundance of hot Irish blood that flows in the veins of the English\nworking-class.  The English working-man is no Englishman nowadays; no\ncalculating money-grabber like his wealthy neighbour.  He possesses more\nfully developed feelings, his native northern coldness is overborne by\nthe unrestrained development of his passions and their control over him.\nThe cultivation of the understanding which so greatly strengthens the\nselfish tendency of the English bourgeois, which has made selfishness his\npredominant trait and concentrated all his emotional power upon the\nsingle point of money-greed, is wanting in the working-man, whose\npassions are therefore strong and mighty as those of the foreigner.\nEnglish nationality is annihilated in the working-man.\n\nSince, as we have seen, no single field for the exercise of his manhood\nis left him, save his opposition to the whole conditions of his life, it\nis natural that exactly in this opposition he should be most manly,\nnoblest, most worthy of sympathy.  We shall see that all the energy, all\nthe activity of the working-men is directed to this point, and that even\ntheir attempts to attain general education all stand in direct connection\nwith this.  True, we shall have single acts of violence and even of\nbrutality to report, but it must always be kept in mind that the social\nwar is avowedly raging in England; and that, whereas it is in the\ninterest of the bourgeoisie to conduct this war hypocritically, under the\ndisguise of peace and even of philanthropy, the only help for the working-\nmen consists in laying bare the true state of things and destroying this\nhypocrisy; that the most violent attacks of the workers upon the\nbourgeoisie and its servants are only the open, undisguised expression of\nthat which the bourgeoisie perpetrates secretly, treacherously against\nthe workers.\n\nThe revolt of the workers began soon after the first industrial\ndevelopment, and has passed through several phases.  The investigation of\ntheir importance in the history of the English people I must reserve for\nseparate treatment, limiting myself meanwhile to such bare facts as serve\nto characterise the condition of the English proletariat.\n\nThe earliest, crudest, and least fruitful form of this rebellion was that\nof crime.  The working-man lived in poverty and want, and saw that others\nwere better off than he.  It was not clear to his mind why he, who did\nmore for society than the rich idler, should be the one to suffer under\nthese conditions.  Want conquered his inherited respect for the\nsacredness of property, and he stole.  We have seen how crime increased\nwith the extension of manufacture; how the yearly number of arrests bore\na constant relation to the number of bales of cotton annually consumed.\n\nThe workers soon realised that crime did not help matters.  The criminal\ncould protest against the existing order of society only singly, as one\nindividual; the whole might of society was brought to bear upon each\ncriminal, and crushed him with its immense superiority.  Besides, theft\nwas the most primitive form of protest, and for this reason, if for no\nother, it never became the universal expression of the public opinion of\nthe working-men, however much they might approve of it in silence.  As a\nclass, they first manifested opposition to the bourgeoisie when they\nresisted the introduction of machinery at the very beginning of the\nindustrial period.  The first inventors, Arkwright and others, were\npersecuted in this way and their machines destroyed.  Later, there took\nplace a number of revolts against machinery, in which the occurrences\nwere almost precisely the same as those of the printers' disturbances in\nBohemia in 1844; factories were demolished and machinery destroyed.\n\nThis form of opposition also was isolated, restricted to certain\nlocalities, and directed against one feature only of our present social\narrangements.  When the momentary end was attained, the whole weight of\nsocial power fell upon the unprotected evil-doers and punished them to\nits heart's content, while the machinery was introduced none the less.  A\nnew form of opposition had to be found.\n\nAt this point help came in the shape of a law enacted by the old,\nunreformed, oligarchic-Tory parliament, a law which never could have\npassed the House of Commons later, when the Reform Bill had legally\nsanctioned the distinction between bourgeoisie and proletariat, and made\nthe bourgeoisie the ruling class.  This was enacted in 1824, and repealed\nall laws by which coalitions between working-men for labour purposes had\nhitherto been forbidden.  The working-men obtained a right previously\nrestricted to the aristocracy and bourgeoisie, the right of free\nassociation.  Secret coalitions had, it is true, previously existed, but\ncould never achieve great results.  In Glasgow, as Symonds {214} relates,\na general strike of weavers had taken place in 1812, which was brought\nabout by a secret association.  It was repeated in 1822, and on this\noccasion vitriol was thrown into the faces of the two working-men who\nwould not join the association, and were therefore regarded by the\nmembers as traitors to their class.  Both the assaulted lost the use of\ntheir eyes in consequence of the injury.  So, too, in 1818, the\nassociation of Scottish miners was powerful enough to carry on a general\nstrike.  These associations required their members to take an oath of\nfidelity and secrecy, had regular lists, treasurers, bookkeepers, and\nlocal branches.  But the secrecy with which everything was conducted\ncrippled their growth.  When, on the other hand, the working-man received\nin 1824 the right of free association, these combinations were very soon\nspread over all England and attained great power.  In all branches of\nindustry Trades Unions were formed with the outspoken intention of\nprotecting the single working-man against the tyranny and neglect of the\nbourgeoisie.  Their objects were to deal, _en masse_, as a power, with\nthe employers; to regulate the rate of wages according to the profit of\nthe latter, to raise it when opportunity offered, and to keep it uniform\nin each trade throughout the country.  Hence they tried to settle with\nthe capitalists a scale of wages to be universally adhered to, and\nordered out on strike the employees of such individuals as refused to\naccept the scale.  They aimed further to keep up the demand for labour by\nlimiting the number of apprentices, and so to keep wages high; to\ncounteract, as far as possible, the indirect wages reductions which the\nmanufacturers brought about by means of new tools and machinery; and\nfinally, to assist unemployed working-men financially.  This they do\neither directly or by means of a card to legitimate the bearer as a\n\"society man,\" and with which the working-man wanders from place to\nplace, supported by his fellow-workers, and instructed as to the best\nopportunity for finding employment.  This is tramping, and the wanderer a\ntramp.  To attain these ends, a President and Secretary are engaged at a\nsalary (since it is to be expected that no manufacturer will employ such\npersons), and a committee collects the weekly contributions and watches\nover their expenditure for the purposes of the association.  When it\nproved possible and advantageous, the various trades of single districts\nunited in a federation and held delegate conventions at set times.  The\nattempt has been made in single cases to unite the workers of one branch\nover all England in one great Union; and several times (in 1830 for the\nfirst time) to form one universal trades association for the whole United\nKingdom, with a separate organisation for each trade.  These\nassociations, however, never held together long, and were seldom realised\neven for the moment, since an exceptionally universal excitement is\nnecessary to make such a federation possible and effective.\n\nThe means usually employed by these Unions for attaining their ends are\nthe following: If one or more employers refuse to pay the wage specified\nby the Union, a deputation is sent or a petition forwarded (the working-\nmen, you see, know how to recognise the absolute power of the lord of the\nfactory in his little State); if this proves unavailing, the Union\ncommands the employees to stop work, and all hands go home.  This strike\nis either partial when one or several, or general when all employers in\nthe trade refuse to regulate wages according to the proposals of the\nUnion.  So far go the lawful means of the Union, assuming the strike to\ntake effect after the expiration of the legal notice, which is not always\nthe case.  But these lawful means are very weak when there are workers\noutside the Union, or when members separate from it for the sake of the\nmomentary advantage offered by the bourgeoisie.  Especially in the case\nof partial strikes can the manufacturer readily secure recruits from\nthese black sheep (who are known as knobsticks), and render fruitless the\nefforts of the united workers.  Knobsticks are usually threatened,\ninsulted, beaten, or otherwise maltreated by the members of the Union;\nintimidated, in short, in every way.  Prosecution follows, and as the law-\nabiding bourgeoisie has the power in its own hands, the force of the\nUnion is broken almost every time by the first unlawful act, the first\njudicial procedure against its members.\n\nThe history of these Unions is a long series of defeats of the working-\nmen, interrupted by a few isolated victories.  All these efforts\nnaturally cannot alter the economic law according to which wages are\ndetermined by the relation between supply and demand in the labour\nmarket.  Hence the Unions remain powerless against all _great_ forces\nwhich influence this relation.  In a commercial crisis the Union itself\nmust reduce wages or dissolve wholly; and in a time of considerable\nincrease in the demand for labour, it cannot fix the rate of wages higher\nthan would be reached spontaneously by the competition of the capitalists\namong themselves.  But in dealing with minor, single influences they are\npowerful.  If the employer had no concentrated, collective opposition to\nexpect, he would in his own interest gradually reduce wages to a lower\nand lower point; indeed, the battle of competition which he has to wage\nagainst his fellow-manufacturers would force him to do so, and wages\nwould soon reach the minimum.  But this competition of the manufacturers\namong themselves is, _under average conditions_, somewhat restricted by\nthe opposition of the working-men.\n\nEvery manufacturer knows that the consequence of a reduction not\njustified by conditions to which his competitors also are subjected,\nwould be a strike, which would most certainly injure him, because his\ncapital would be idle as long as the strike lasted, and his machinery\nwould be rusting, whereas it is very doubtful whether he could, in such a\ncase, enforce his reduction.  Then he has the certainty that if he should\nsucceed, his competitors would follow him, reducing the price of the\ngoods so produced, and thus depriving him of the benefit of his policy.\nThen, too, the Unions often bring about a more rapid increase of wages\nafter a crisis than would otherwise follow.  For the manufacturer's\ninterest is to delay raising wages until forced by competition, but now\nthe working-men demand an increased wage as soon as the market improves,\nand they can carry their point by reason of the smaller supply of workers\nat his command under such circumstances.  But, for resistance to more\nconsiderable forces which influence the labour market, the Unions are\npowerless.  In such cases hunger gradually drives the strikers to resume\nwork on any terms, and when once a few have begun; the force of the Union\nis broken, because these few knobsticks, with the reserve supplies of\ngoods in the market, enable the bourgeoisie to overcome the worst effects\nof the interruption of business.  The funds of the Union are soon\nexhausted by the great numbers requiring relief, the credit which the\nshopkeepers give at high interest is withdrawn after a time, and want\ncompels the working-man to place himself once more under the yoke of the\nbourgeoisie.  But strikes end disastrously for the workers mostly,\nbecause the manufacturers, in their own interest (which has, be it said,\nbecome their interest only through the resistance of the workers), are\nobliged to avoid all useless reductions, while the workers feel in every\nreduction imposed by the state of trade a deterioration of their\ncondition, against which they must defend themselves as far as in them\nlies.\n\nIt will be asked, \"Why, then, do the workers strike in such cases, when\nthe uselessness of such measures is so evident?\"  Simply because they\n_must_ protest against every reduction, even if dictated by necessity;\nbecause they feel bound to proclaim that they, as human beings, shall not\nbe made to bow to social circumstances, but social conditions ought to\nyield to them as human beings; because silence on their part would be a\nrecognition of these social conditions, an admission of the right of the\nbourgeoisie to exploit the workers in good times and let them starve in\nbad ones.  Against this the working-men must rebel so long as they have\nnot lost all human feeling, and that they protest in this way and no\nother, comes of their being practical English people, who express\nthemselves in _action_, and do not, like German theorists, go to sleep as\nsoon as their protest is properly registered and placed _ad acta_, there\nto sleep as quietly as the protesters themselves.  The active resistance\nof the English working-men has its effect in holding the money greed of\nthe bourgeoisie within certain limits, and keeping alive the opposition\nof the workers to the social and political omnipotence of the\nbourgeoisie, while it compels the admission that something more is needed\nthan Trades Unions and strikes to break the power of the ruling class.\nBut what gives these Unions and the strikes arising from them their real\nimportance is this, that they are the first attempt of the workers to\nabolish competition.  They imply the recognition of the fact that the\nsupremacy of the bourgeoisie is based wholly upon the competition of the\nworkers among themselves; _i.e_., upon their want of cohesion.  And\nprecisely because the Unions direct themselves against the vital nerve of\nthe present social order, however one-sidedly, in however narrow a way,\nare they so dangerous to this social order.  The working-men cannot\nattack the bourgeoisie, and with it the whole existing order of society,\nat any sorer point than this.  If the competition of the workers among\nthemselves is destroyed, if all determine not to be further exploited by\nthe bourgeoisie, the rule of property is at an end.  Wages depend upon\nthe relation of demand to supply, upon the accidental state of the labour\nmarket, simply because the workers have hitherto been content to be\ntreated as chattels, to be bought and sold.  The moment the workers\nresolve to be bought and sold no longer, when in the determination of the\nvalue of labour, they take the part of men possessed of a will as well as\nof working-power, at that moment the whole Political Economy of to-day is\nat an end.\n\nThe laws determining the rate of wages would, indeed, come into force\nagain in the long run, if the working-men did not go beyond this step of\nabolishing competition among themselves.  But they must go beyond that\nunless they are prepared to recede again and to allow competition among\nthemselves to reappear.  Thus once advanced so far, necessity compels\nthem to go farther; to abolish not only one kind of competition, but\ncompetition itself altogether, and that they will do.\n\nThe workers are coming to perceive more clearly with every day how\ncompetition affects them; they see far more clearly than the bourgeois\nthat competition of the capitalists among themselves presses upon the\nworkers too, by bringing on commercial crises, and that this kind of\ncompetition; too, must be abolished.  They will soon learn _how_ they\nhave to go about it.\n\nThat these Unions contribute greatly to nourish the bitter hatred of the\nworkers against the property-holding class need hardly be said.  From\nthem proceed, therefore, with or without the connivance of the leading\nmembers, in times of unusual excitement, individual actions which can be\nexplained only by hatred wrought to the pitch of despair, by a wild\npassion overwhelming all restraints.  Of this sort are the attacks with\nvitriol mentioned in the foregoing pages, and a series of others, of\nwhich I shall cite several.  In 1831, during a violent labour movement,\nyoung Ashton, a manufacturer in Hyde, near Manchester, was shot one\nevening when crossing a field, and no trace of the assassin discovered.\nThere is no doubt that this was a deed of vengeance of the working-men.\nIncendiarisms and attempted explosions are very common.  On Friday,\nSeptember 29th, 1843, an attempt was made to blow up the saw-works of\nPadgin, in Howard Street, Sheffield.  A closed iron tube filled with\npowder was the means employed, and the damage was considerable.  On the\nfollowing day, a similar attempt was made in Ibbetson's knife and file\nworks at Shales Moor, near Sheffield.  Mr. Ibbetson had made himself\nobnoxious by an active participation in bourgeois movements, by low\nwages, the exclusive employment of knobsticks, and the exploitation of\nthe Poor Law for his own benefit.  He had reported, during the crisis of\n1842, such operatives as refused to accept reduced wages, as persons who\ncould find work but would not take it, and were, therefore, not deserving\nof relief, so compelling the acceptance of a reduction.  Considerable\ndamage was inflicted by the explosion, and all the working-men who came\nto view it regretted only \"that the whole concern was not blown into the\nair.\"  On Friday, October 6th, 1844, an attempt to set fire to the\nfactory of Ainsworth and Crompton, at Bolton, did no damage; it was the\nthird or fourth attempt in the same factory within a very short time.  In\nthe meeting of the Town Council of Sheffield, on Wednesday, January 10th,\n1844, the Commissioner of Police exhibited a cast-iron machine, made for\nthe express purpose of producing an explosion, and found filled with four\npounds of powder, and a fuse which had been lighted but had not taken\neffect, in the works of Mr. Kitchen, Earl Street, Sheffield.  On Sunday,\nJanuary 20th, 1844, an explosion caused by a package of powder took place\nin the sawmill of Bently & White, at Bury, in Lancashire, and produced\nconsiderable damage.  On Thursday, February 1st, 1844, the Soho Wheel\nWorks, in Sheffield, were set on fire and burnt up.\n\nHere are six such cases in four months, all of which have their sole\norigin in the embitterment of the working-men against the employers.  What\nsort of a social state it must be in which such things are possible I\nneed hardly say.  These facts are proof enough that in England, even in\ngood business years, such as 1843, the social war is avowed and openly\ncarried on, and still the English bourgeoisie does not stop to reflect!\nBut the case which speaks most loudly is that of the Glasgow Thugs,\n{221a} which came up before the Assizes from the 3rd to the 11th of\nJanuary, 1838.  It appears from the proceedings that the Cotton-Spinners'\nUnion, which existed here from the year 1816, possessed rare organisation\nand power.  The members were bound by an oath to adhere to the decision\nof the majority, and had during every turnout a secret committee which\nwas unknown to the mass of the members, and controlled the funds of the\nUnion absolutely.  This committee fixed a price upon the heads of\nknobsticks and obnoxious manufacturers and upon incendiarisms in mills.  A\nmill was thus set on fire in which female knobsticks were employed in\nspinning in the place of men; a Mrs. M'Pherson, mother of one of these\ngirls, was murdered, and both murderers sent to America at the expense of\nthe association.  As early as 1820, a knobstick named M'Quarry was shot\nat and wounded, for which deed the doer received twenty pounds from the\nUnion, but was discovered and transported for life.  Finally, in 1837, in\nMay, disturbances occurred in consequence of a turnout in the Oatbank and\nMile End factories, in which perhaps a dozen knobsticks were maltreated.\nIn July, of the same year, the disturbances still continued, and a\ncertain Smith, a knobstick, was so maltreated that he died.  The\ncommittee was now arrested, an investigation begun, and the leading\nmembers found guilty of participation in conspiracies, maltreatment of\nknobsticks, and incendiarism in the mill of James and Francis Wood, and\nthey were transported for seven years.  What do our good Germans say to\nthis story? {221b}\n\nThe property-holding class, and especially the manufacturing portion of\nit which comes into direct contact with the working-men, declaims with\nthe greatest violence against these Unions, and is constantly trying to\nprove their uselessness to the working-men upon grounds which are\neconomically perfectly correct, but for that very reason partially\nmistaken, and for the working-man's understanding totally without effect.\nThe very zeal of the bourgeoisie shows that it is not disinterested in\nthe matter; and apart from the indirect loss involved in a turnout, the\nstate of the case is such that whatever goes into the pockets of the\nmanufacturers comes of necessity out of those of the worker.  So that\neven if the working-men did not know that the Unions hold the emulation\nof their masters in the reduction of wages, at least in a measure, in\ncheck, they would still stand by the Unions, simply to the injury of\ntheir enemies, the manufacturers.  In war the injury of one party is the\nbenefit of the other, and since the working-men are on a war-footing\ntowards their employers, they do merely what the great potentates do when\nthey get into a quarrel.  Beyond all other bourgeois is our friend Dr.\nUre, the most furious enemy of the Unions.  He foams with indignation at\nthe \"secret tribunals\" of the cotton-spinners, the most powerful section\nof the workers, tribunals which boast their ability to paralyse every\ndisobedient manufacturer, {222a} \"and so bring ruin on the man who had\ngiven them profitable employment for many a year.\"  He speaks of a time\n{222b} \"when the inventive head and the sustaining heart of trade were\nheld in bondage by the unruly lower members.\"  A pity that the English\nworking-men will not let themselves be pacified so easily with thy fable\nas the Roman Plebs, thou modern Menenius Agrippa!  Finally, he relates\nthe following: At one time the coarse mule-spinners had misused their\npower beyond all endurance.  High wages, instead of awakening\nthankfulness towards the manufacturers and leading to intellectual\nimprovement (in harmless study of sciences useful to the bourgeoisie, of\ncourse), in many cases produced pride and supplied funds for supporting\nrebellious spirits in strikes, with which a number of manufacturers were\nvisited one after the other in a purely arbitrary manner.  During an\nunhappy disturbance of this sort in Hyde, Dukinfield, and the surrounding\nneighbourhood, the manufacturers of the district, anxious lest they\nshould be driven from the market by the French, Belgians, and Americans,\naddressed themselves to the machine-works of Sharp, Roberts & Co., and\nrequested Mr. Sharp to turn his inventive mind to the construction of an\nautomatic mule in order \"to emancipate the trade from galling slavery and\nimpending ruin.\" {223a}\n\n\"He produced in the course of a few months a machine apparently instinct\nwith the thought, feeling, and tact of the experienced workman--which\neven in its infancy displayed a new principle of regulation, ready in its\nmature state to fulfil the functions of a finished spinner.  Thus the\nIron Man, as the operatives fitly call it, sprung out of the hands of our\nmodern Prometheus at the bidding of Minerva--a creation destined to\nrestore order among the industrious classes, and to confirm to Great\nBritain the empire of art.  The news of this Herculean prodigy spread\ndismay through the Union, and even long before it left its cradle, so to\nspeak, it strangled the Hydra of misrule.\" {223b}\n\nUre proves further that the invention of the machine, with which four and\nfive colours are printed at once, was a result of the disturbances among\nthe calico printers; that the refractoriness of the yarn-dressers in the\npower-loom weaving mills gave rise to a new and perfected machine for\nwarp-dressing, and mentions several other such cases.  A few pages\nearlier this same Ure gives himself a great deal of trouble to prove in\ndetail that machinery is beneficial to the workers!  But Ure is not the\nonly one; in the Factory Report, Mr. Ashworth, the manufacturer, and many\nanother, lose no opportunity to express their wrath against the Unions.\nThese wise bourgeois, like certain governments, trace every movement\nwhich they do not understand, to the influence of ill-intentioned\nagitators, demagogues, traitors, spouting idiots, and ill-balanced youth.\nThey declare that the paid agents of the Unions are interested in the\nagitation because they live upon it, as though the necessity for this\npayment were not forced upon them by the bourgeois, who will give such\nmen no employment!\n\nThe incredible frequency of these strikes proves best of all to what\nextent the social war has broken out all over England.  No week passes,\nscarcely a day, indeed, in which there is not a strike in some direction,\nnow against a reduction, then against a refusal to raise the rate of\nwages, again by reason of the employment of knobsticks or the continuance\nof abuses, sometimes against new machinery, or for a hundred other\nreasons.  These strikes, at first skirmishes, sometimes result in weighty\nstruggles; they decide nothing, it is true, but they are the strongest\nproof that the decisive battle between bourgeoisie and proletariat is\napproaching.  They are the military school of the working-men in which\nthey prepare themselves for the great struggle which cannot be avoided;\nthey are the pronunciamentos of single branches of industry that these\ntoo have joined the labour movement.  And when one examines a year's file\nof the _Northern Star_, the only sheet which reports all the movements of\nthe proletariat, one finds that all the proletarians of the towns and of\ncountry manufacture have united in associations, and have protested from\ntime to time, by means of a general strike, against the supremacy of the\nbourgeoisie.  And as schools of war, the Unions are unexcelled.  In them\nis developed the peculiar courage of the English.  It is said on the\nContinent that the English, and especially the working-men, are cowardly,\nthat they cannot carry out a revolution because, unlike the French, they\ndo not riot at intervals, because they apparently accept the bourgeois\n_regime_ so quietly.  This is a complete mistake.  The English working-\nmen are second to none in courage; they are quite as restless as the\nFrench, but they fight differently.  The French, who are by nature\npolitical, struggle against social evils with political weapons; the\nEnglish, for whom politics exist only as a matter of interest, solely in\nthe interest of bourgeois society, fight, not against the Government, but\ndirectly against the bourgeoisie; and for the time, this can be done only\nin a peaceful manner.  Stagnation in business, and the want consequent\nupon it, engendered the revolt at Lyons, in 1834, in favour of the\nRepublic: in 1842, at Manchester, a similar cause gave rise to a\nuniversal turnout for the Charter and higher wages.  That courage is\nrequired for a turnout, often indeed much loftier courage, much bolder,\nfirmer determination than for an insurrection, is self-evident.  It is,\nin truth, no trifle for a working-man who knows want from experience, to\nface it with wife and children, to endure hunger and wretchedness for\nmonths together, and stand firm and unshaken through it all.  What is\ndeath, what the galleys which await the French revolutionist, in\ncomparison with gradual starvation, with the daily sight of a starving\nfamily, with the certainty of future revenge on the part of the\nbourgeoisie, all of which the English working-man chooses in preference\nto subjection under the yoke of the property-holding class?  We shall\nmeet later an example of this obstinate, unconquerable courage of men who\nsurrender to force only when all resistance would be aimless and\nunmeaning.  And precisely in this quiet perseverance, in this lasting\ndetermination which undergoes a hundred tests every day, the English\nworking-man develops that side of his character which commands most\nrespect.  People who endure so much to bend one single bourgeois will be\nable to break the power of the whole bourgeoisie.\n\nBut apart from that, the English working-man has proved his courage often\nenough.  That the turnout of 1842 had no further results came from the\nfact that the men were in part forced into it by the bourgeoisie, in part\nneither clear nor united as to its object.  But aside from this, they\nhave shown their courage often enough when the matter in question was a\nspecific social one.  Not to mention the Welsh insurrection of 1839, a\ncomplete battle was waged in Manchester in May, 1843, during my residence\nthere.  Pauling & Henfrey, a brick firm, had increased the size of the\nbricks without raising wages, and sold the bricks, of course, at a higher\nprice.  The workers, to whom higher wages were refused, struck work, and\nthe Brickmakers' Union declared war upon the firm.  The firm, meanwhile,\nsucceeded with great difficulty in securing hands from the neighbourhood,\nand among the knobsticks, against whom in the beginning intimidation was\nused, the proprietors set twelve men to guard the yard, all ex-soldiers\nand policemen, armed with guns.  When intimidation proved unavailing, the\nbrick-yard, which lay scarcely a hundred paces from an infantry barracks,\nwas stormed at ten o'clock one night by a crowd of brickmakers, who\nadvanced in military order, the first ranks armed with guns.  They forced\ntheir way in, fired upon the watchmen as soon as they saw them, stamped\nout the wet bricks spread out to dry, tore down the piled-up rows of\nthose already dry, demolished everything which came in their way, pressed\ninto a building, where they destroyed the furniture and maltreated the\nwife of the overlooker who was living there.  The watchmen, meanwhile,\nhad placed themselves behind a hedge, whence they could fire safely and\nwithout interruption.  The assailants stood before a burning brick-kiln,\nwhich threw a bright light upon them, so that every ball of their enemies\nstruck home, while every one of their own shots missed its mark.\nNevertheless, the firing lasted half-an-hour, until the ammunition was\nexhausted, and the object of the visit--the demolition of all the\ndestructible objects in the yard--was attained.  Then the military\napproached, and the brickmakers withdrew to Eccles, three miles from\nManchester.  A short time before reaching Eccles they held roll-call, and\neach man was called according to his number in the section when they\nseparated, only to fall the more certainly into the hands of the police,\nwho were approaching from all sides.  The number of the wounded must have\nbeen very considerable, but those only could be counted who were\narrested.  One of these had received three bullets (in the thigh, the\ncalf, and the shoulder), and had travelled in spite of them more than\nfour miles on foot.  These people have proved that they, too, possess\nrevolutionary courage, and do not shun a rain of bullets.  And when an\nunarmed multitude, without a precise aim common to them all, are held in\ncheck in a shut-off market-place, whose outlets are guarded by a couple\nof policemen and dragoons, as happened in 1842, this by no means proves a\nwant of courage.  On the contrary, the multitude would have stirred quite\nas little if the servants of public (_i.e_., of the bourgeois) order had\nnot been present.  Where the working-people have a specific end in view,\nthey show courage enough; as, for instance, in the attack upon Birley's\nmill, which had later to be protected by artillery.\n\nIn this connection, a word or two as to the respect for the law in\nEngland.  True, the law is sacred to the bourgeois, for it is his own\ncomposition, enacted with his consent, and for his benefit and\nprotection.  He knows that, even if an individual law should injure him,\nthe whole fabric protects his interests; and more than all, the sanctity\nof the law, the sacredness of order as established by the active will of\none part of society, and the passive acceptance of the other, is the\nstrongest support of his social position.  Because the English bourgeois\nfinds himself reproduced in his law, as he does in his God, the\npoliceman's truncheon which, in a certain measure, is his own club, has\nfor him a wonderfully soothing power.  But for the working-man quite\notherwise!  The working-man knows too well, has learned from too\noft-repeated experience, that the law is a rod which the bourgeois has\nprepared for him; and when he is not compelled to do so, he never appeals\nto the law.  It is ridiculous to assert that the English working-man\nfears the police, when every week in Manchester policemen are beaten, and\nlast year an attempt was made to storm a station-house secured by iron\ndoors and shutters.  The power of the police in the turnout of 1842 lay,\nas I have already said, in the want of a clearly defined object on the\npart of the working-men themselves.\n\nSince the working-men do not respect the law, but simply submit to its\npower when they cannot change it, it is most natural that they should at\nleast propose alterations in it, that they should wish to put a\nproletarian law in the place of the legal fabric of the bourgeoisie.  This\nproposed law is the People's Charter, which in form is purely political,\nand demands a democratic basis for the House of Commons.  Chartism is the\ncompact form of their opposition to the bourgeoisie.  In the Unions and\nturnouts opposition always remained isolated: it was single working-men\nor sections who fought a single bourgeois.  If the fight became general,\nthis was scarcely by the intention of the working-men; or, when it did\nhappen intentionally, Chartism was at the bottom of it.  But in Chartism\nit is the whole working class which arises against the bourgeoisie, and\nattacks, first of all, the political power, the legislative rampart with\nwhich the bourgeoisie has surrounded itself.  Chartism has proceeded from\nthe Democratic party which arose between 1780 and 1790 with and in the\nproletariat, gained strength during the French Revolution, and came forth\nafter the peace as the Radical party.  It had its headquarters then in\nBirmingham and Manchester, and later in London; extorted the Reform Bill\nfrom the Oligarchs of the old Parliament by a union with the Liberal\nbourgeoisie, and has steadily consolidated itself, since then, as a more\nand more pronounced working-men's party in opposition to the bourgeoisie\nIn 1835 a committee of the General Working-men's Association of London,\nwith William Lovett at its head, drew up the People's Charter, whose six\npoints are as follows: (1) Universal suffrage for every man who is of\nage, sane and unconvicted of crime; (2) Annual Parliaments; (3) Payment\nof members of Parliament, to enable poor men to stand for election; (4)\nVoting by ballot to prevent bribery and intimidation by the bourgeoisie;\n(5) Equal electoral districts to secure equal representation; and (6)\nAbolition of the even now merely nominal property qualification of 300\npounds in land for candidates in order to make every voter eligible.\nThese six points, which are all limited to the reconstitution of the\nHouse of Commons, harmless as they seem, are sufficient to overthrow the\nwhole English Constitution, Queen and Lords included.  The so-called\nmonarchical and aristocratic elements of the Constitution can maintain\nthemselves only because the bourgeoisie has an interest in the\ncontinuance of their sham existence; and more than a sham existence\nneither possesses to-day.  But as soon as real public opinion in its\ntotality backs the House of Commons, as soon as the House of Commons\nincorporates the will, not of the bourgeoisie alone, but of the whole\nnation, it will absorb the whole power so completely that the last halo\nmust fall from the head of the monarch and the aristocracy.  The English\nworking-man respects neither Lords nor Queen.  The bourgeois, while in\nreality allowing them but little influence, yet offers to them personally\na sham worship.  The English Chartist is politically a republican, though\nhe rarely or never mentions the word, while he sympathises with the\nrepublican parties of all countries, and calls himself in preference a\ndemocrat.  But he is more than a mere republican, his democracy is not\nsimply political.\n\nChartism was from the beginning in 1835 chiefly a movement among the\nworking-men, though not yet sharply separated from the bourgeoisie.  The\nRadicalism of the workers went hand in hand with the Radicalism of the\nbourgeoisie; the Charter was the shibboleth of both.  They held their\nNational Convention every year in common, seeming to be one party.  The\nlower middle-class was just then in a very bellicose and violent state of\nmind in consequence of the disappointment over the Reform Bill and of the\nbad business years of 1837-1839, and viewed the boisterous Chartist\nagitation with a very favourable eye.  Of the vehemence of this agitation\nno one in Germany has any idea.  The people were called upon to arm\nthemselves, were frequently urged to revolt; pikes were got ready, as in\nthe French Revolution, and in 1838, one Stephens, a Methodist parson,\nsaid to the assembled working-people of Manchester:\n\n   \"You have no need to fear the power of Government, the soldiers,\n   bayonets, and cannon that are at the disposal of your oppressors; you\n   have a weapon that is far mightier than all these, a weapon against\n   which bayonets and cannon are powerless, and a child of ten years can\n   wield it.  You have only to take a couple of matches and a bundle of\n   straw dipped in pitch, and I will see what the Government and its\n   hundreds of thousands of soldiers will do against this one weapon if\n   it is used boldly.\"\n\nAs early as that year the peculiarly social character of the\nworking-men's Chartism manifested itself.  The same Stephens said, in a\nmeeting of 200,000 men on Kersall Moor, the Mons Sacer of Manchester:\n\n   \"Chartism, my friends, is no political movement, where the main point\n   is your getting the ballot.  Chartism is a knife and fork question:\n   the Charter means a good house, good food and drink, prosperity, and\n   short working-hours.\"\n\nThe movements against the new Poor Law and for the Ten Hours' Bill were\nalready in the closest relation to Chartism.  In all the meetings of that\ntime the Tory Oastler was active, and hundreds of petitions for\nimprovements of the social condition of the workers were circulated along\nwith the national petition for the People's Charter adopted in\nBirmingham.  In 1839 the agitation continued as vigorously as ever, and\nwhen it began to relax somewhat at the end of the year, Bussey, Taylor,\nand Frost hastened to call forth uprisings simultaneously in the North of\nEngland, in Yorkshire, and Wales.  Frost's plan being betrayed, he was\nobliged to open hostilities prematurely.  Those in the North heard of the\nfailure of his attempt in time to withdraw.  Two months later, in\nJanuary, 1840, several so-called spy outbreaks took place in Sheffield\nand Bradford, in Yorkshire, and the excitement gradually subsided.\nMeanwhile the bourgeoisie turned its attention to more practical\nprojects, more profitable for itself, namely the Corn Laws.  The Anti-\nCorn Law Association was formed in Manchester, and the consequence was a\nrelaxation of the tie between the Radical bourgeoisie and the\nproletariat.  The working-men soon perceived that for them the abolition\nof the Corn Laws could be of little use, while very advantageous to the\nbourgeoisie; and they could therefore not be won for the project.\n\nThe crisis of 1842 came on.  Agitation was once more as vigorous as in\n1839.  But this time the rich manufacturing bourgeoisie, which was\nsuffering severely under this particular crisis, took part in it.  The\nAnti-Corn Law League, as it was now called, assumed a decidedly\nrevolutionary tone.  Its journals and agitators used undisguisedly\nrevolutionary language, one very good reason for which was the fact that\nthe Conservative party had been in power since 1841.  As the Chartists\nhad previously done, these bourgeois leaders called upon the people to\nrebel; and the working-men who had most to suffer from the crisis were\nnot inactive, as the year's national petition for the charter with its\nthree and a half million signatures proves.  In short, if the two Radical\nparties had been somewhat estranged, they allied themselves once more.  At\na meeting of Liberals and Chartists held in Manchester, February 15th,\n1842, a petition urging the repeal of the Corn Laws and the adoption of\nthe Charter was drawn up.  The next day it was adopted by both parties.\nThe spring and summer passed amidst violent agitation and increasing\ndistress.  The bourgeoisie was determined to carry the repeal of the Corn\nLaws with the help of the crisis, the want which it entailed, and the\ngeneral excitement.  At this time, the Conservatives being in power, the\nLiberal bourgeoisie half abandoned their law-abiding habits; they wished\nto bring about a revolution with the help of the workers.  The working-\nmen were to take the chestnuts from the fire to save the bourgeoisie from\nburning their own fingers.  The old idea of a \"holy month,\" a general\nstrike, broached in 1839 by the Chartists, was revived.  This time,\nhowever, it was not the working-men who wished to quit work, but the\nmanufacturers who wished to close their mills and send the operatives\ninto the country parishes upon the property of the aristocracy, thus\nforcing the Tory Parliament and the Tory Ministry to repeal the Corn\nLaws.  A revolt would naturally have followed, but the bourgeoisie stood\nsafely in the background and could await the result without compromising\nitself if the worst came to the worst.  At the end of July business began\nto improve; it was high time.  In order not to lose the opportunity,\nthree firms in Staleybridge reduced wages in spite of the improvement.\n{232}  Whether they did so of their own motion or in agreement with other\nmanufacturers, especially those of the League, I do not know.  Two\nwithdrew after a time, but the third, William Bailey & Brothers, stood\nfirm, and told the objecting operatives that \"if this did not please\nthem, they had better go and play a bit.\"  This contemptuous answer the\nhands received with cheers.  They left the mill, paraded through the\ntown, and called upon all their fellows to quit work.  In a few hours\nevery mill stood idle, and the operatives marched to Mottram Moor to hold\na meeting.  This was on August 5th.  August 8th they proceeded to Ashton\nand Hyde five thousand strong, closed all the mills and coal-pits, and\nheld meetings, in which, however, the question discussed was not, as the\nbourgeoisie had hoped, the repeal of the Corn Laws, but, \"a fair day's\nwages for a fair day's work.\"  August 9th they proceeded to Manchester,\nunresisted by the authorities (all Liberals), and closed the mills; on\nthe 11th they were in Stockport, where they met with the first resistance\nas they were storming the workhouse, the favourite child of the\nbourgeoisie.  On the same day there was a general strike and disturbance\nin Bolton, to which the authorities here, too, made no resistance.  Soon\nthe uprising spread throughout the whole manufacturing district, and all\nemployments, except harvesting and the production of food, came to a\nstandstill.  But the rebellious operatives were quiet.  They were driven\ninto this revolt without wishing it.  The manufacturers, with the single\nexception of the Tory Birley, in Manchester, had, _contrary to their\ncustom_, not opposed it.  The thing had begun without the working-men's\nhaving any distinct end in view, for which reason they were all united in\nthe determination not to be shot at for the benefit of the Corn Law\nrepealing bourgeoisie.  For the rest, some wanted to carry the Charter,\nothers who thought this premature wished merely to secure the wages rate\nof 1840.  On this point the whole insurrection was wrecked.  If it had\nbeen from the beginning an intentional, determined working-men's\ninsurrection, it would surely have carried its point; but these crowds\nwho had been driven into the streets by their masters, against their own\nwill, and with no definite purpose, could do nothing.  Meanwhile the\nbourgeoisie, which had not moved a finger to carry the alliance of\nFebruary 10th into effect, soon perceived that the working-men did not\npropose to become its tools, and that the illogical manner in which it\nhad abandoned its law-abiding standpoint threatened danger.  It therefore\nresumed its law-abiding attitude, and placed itself upon the side of\nGovernment as against the working-men.\n\nIt swore in trusty retainers as special constables (the German merchants\nin Manchester took part in this ceremony, and marched in an entirely\nsuperfluous manner through the city with their cigars in their mouths and\nthick truncheons in their hands).  It gave the command to fire upon the\ncrowd in Preston, so that the unintentional revolt of the people stood\nall at once face to face, not only with the whole military power of the\nGovernment, but with the whole property-holding class as well.  The\nworking-men, who had no especial aim, separated gradually, and the\ninsurrection came to an end without evil results.  Later, the bourgeoisie\nwas guilty of one shameful act after another, tried to whitewash itself\nby expressing a horror of popular violence by no means consistent with\nits own revolutionary language of the spring; laid the blame of\ninsurrection upon Chartist instigators, whereas it had itself done more\nthan all of them together to bring about the uprising; and resumed its\nold attitude of sanctifying the name of the law with a shamelessness\nperfectly unequalled.  The Chartists, who were all but innocent of\nbringing about this uprising, who simply did what the bourgeoisie meant\nto do when they made the most of their opportunity, were prosecuted and\nconvicted, while the bourgeoisie escaped without loss, and had, besides,\nsold off its old stock of goods with advantage during the pause in work.\n\nThe fruit of the uprising was the decisive separation of the proletariat\nfrom the bourgeoisie.  The Chartists had not hitherto concealed their\ndetermination to carry the Charter at all costs, even that of a\nrevolution; the bourgeoisie, which now perceived, all at once, the danger\nwith which any violent change threatened its position, refused to hear\nanything further of physical force, and proposed to attain its end by\nmoral force, as though this were anything else than the direct or\nindirect threat of physical force.  This was one point of dissension,\nthough even this was removed later by the assertion of the Chartists (who\nare at least as worthy of being believed as the bourgeoisie) that they,\ntoo, refrained from appealing to physical force.  The second point of\ndissension and the main one, which brought Chartism to light in its\npurity, was the repeal of the Corn Laws.  In this the bourgeoisie was\ndirectly interested, the proletariat not.  The Chartists therefore\ndivided into two parties whose political programmes agreed literally, but\nwhich were nevertheless thoroughly different and incapable of union.  At\nthe Birmingham National Convention, in January, 1843, Sturge, the\nrepresentative of the Radical bourgeoisie, proposed that the name of the\nCharter be omitted from the rules of the Chartist Association, nominally\nbecause this name had become connected with recollections of violence\nduring the insurrection, a connection, by the way, which had existed for\nyears, and against which Mr. Sturge had hitherto advanced no objection.\nThe working-men refused to drop the name, and when Mr. Sturge was\noutvoted, that worthy Quaker suddenly became loyal, betook himself out of\nthe hall, and founded a \"Complete Suffrage Association\" within the\nRadical bourgeoisie.  So repugnant had these recollections become to the\nJacobinical bourgeoisie, that he altered even the name Universal Suffrage\ninto the ridiculous title, Complete Suffrage.  The working-men laughed at\nhim and quietly went their way.\n\nFrom this moment Chartism was purely a working-man's cause freed from all\nbourgeois elements.  The \"Complete\" journals, the _Weekly Dispatch_,\n_Weekly Chronicle_, _Examiner_, etc., fell gradually into the sleepy tone\nof the other Liberal sheets, espoused the cause of Free Trade, attacked\nthe Ten Hours' Bill and all exclusively working-men's demands, and let\ntheir Radicalism as a whole fall rather into the background.  The Radical\nbourgeoisie joined hands with the Liberals against the working-men in\nevery collision, and in general made the Corn Law question, which for the\nEnglish is the Free Trade question, their main business.  They thereby\nfell under the dominion of the Liberal bourgeoisie, and now play a most\npitiful role.\n\nThe Chartist working-men, on the contrary, espoused with redoubled zeal\nall the struggles of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie.  Free\ncompetition has caused the workers suffering enough to be hated by them;\nits apostles, the bourgeoisie, are their declared enemies.  The working-\nman has only disadvantages to await from the complete freedom of\ncompetition.  The demands hitherto made by him, the Ten Hours' Bill,\nprotection of the workers against the capitalist, good wages, a\nguaranteed position, repeal of the new Poor Law, all of the things which\nbelong to Chartism quite as essentially as the \"Six Points,\" are directly\nopposed to free competition and Free Trade.  No wonder, then, that the\nworking-men will not hear of Free Trade and the repeal of the Corn Laws\n(a fact incomprehensible to the whole English bourgeoisie), and while at\nleast wholly indifferent to the Corn Law question, are most deeply\nembittered against its advocates.  This question is precisely the point\nat which the proletariat separates from the bourgeoisie, Chartism from\nRadicalism; and the bourgeois understanding cannot comprehend this,\nbecause it cannot comprehend the proletariat.\n\nTherein lies the difference between Chartist democracy and all previous\npolitical bourgeois democracy.  Chartism is of an essentially social\nnature, a class movement.  The \"Six Points\" which for the Radical\nbourgeois are the beginning and end of the matter, which are meant, at\nthe utmost, to call forth certain further reforms of the Constitution,\nare for the proletarian a mere means to further ends.  \"Political power\nour means, social happiness our end,\" is now the clearly formulated war-\ncry of the Chartists.  The \"knife and fork question\" of the preacher\nStephens was a truth for a part of the Chartists only, in 1838, it is a\ntruth for all of them in 1845.  There is no longer a mere politician\namong the Chartists, and even though their Socialism is very little\ndeveloped, though their chief remedy for poverty has hitherto consisted\nin the land-allotment system, which was superseded {235} by the\nintroduction of manufacture, though their chief practical propositions\nare apparently of a reactionary nature, yet these very measures involve\nthe alternative that they must either succumb to the power of competition\nonce more and restore the old state of things, or they must themselves\nentirely overcome competition and abolish it.  On the other hand, the\npresent indefinite state of Chartism, the separation from the purely\npolitical party, involves that precisely the characteristic feature, its\nsocial aspect, will have to be further developed.  The approach to\nSocialism cannot fail, especially when the next crisis directs the\nworking-men by force of sheer want to social instead of political\nremedies.  And a crisis must follow the present active state of industry\nand commerce in 1847 at the latest, and probably in 1846; one, too, which\nwill far exceed in extent and violence all former crises.  The working-\nmen will carry their Charter, naturally; but meanwhile they will learn to\nsee clearly with regard to many points which they can make by means of it\nand of which they now know very little.\n\nMeanwhile the socialist agitation also goes forward.  English Socialism\ncomes under our consideration so far only as it affects the\nworking-class.  The English Socialists demand the gradual introduction of\npossession in common in home colonies embracing two to three thousand\npersons who shall carry on both agriculture and manufacture and enjoy\nequal rights and equal education.  They demand greater facility of\nobtaining divorce, the establishment of a rational government, with\ncomplete freedom of conscience and the abolition of punishment, the same\nto be replaced by a rational treatment of the offender.  These are their\npractical measures, their theoretical principles do not concern us here.\nEnglish Socialism arose with Owen, a manufacturer, and proceeds therefore\nwith great consideration toward the bourgeoisie and great injustice\ntoward the proletariat in its methods, although it culminates in\ndemanding the abolition of the class antagonism between bourgeoisie and\nproletariat.\n\nThe Socialists are thoroughly tame and peaceable, accept our existing\norder, bad as it is, so far as to reject all other methods but that of\nwinning public opinion.  Yet they are so dogmatic that success by this\nmethod is for them, and for their principles as at present formulated,\nutterly hopeless.  While bemoaning the demoralisation of the lower\nclasses, they are blind to the element of progress in this dissolution of\nthe old social order, and refuse to acknowledge that the corruption\nwrought by private interests and hypocrisy in the property-holding class\nis much greater.  They acknowledge no historic development, and wish to\nplace the nation in a state of Communism at once, overnight, not by the\nunavoidable march of its political development up to the point at which\nthis transition becomes both possible and necessary.  They understand, it\nis true, why the working-man is resentful against the bourgeois, but\nregard as unfruitful this class hatred, which is, after all, the only\nmoral incentive by which the worker can be brought nearer the goal.  They\npreach instead, a philanthropy and universal love far more unfruitful for\nthe present state of England.  They acknowledge only a psychological\ndevelopment, a development of man in the abstract, out of all relation to\nthe Past, whereas the whole world rests upon that Past, the individual\nman included.  Hence they are too abstract, too metaphysical, and\naccomplish little.  They are recruited in part from the working-class, of\nwhich they have enlisted but a very small fraction representing, however,\nits most educated and solid elements.  In its present form, Socialism can\nnever become the common creed of the working-class; it must condescend to\nreturn for a moment to the Chartist standpoint.  But the true proletarian\nSocialism having passed through Chartism, purified of its bourgeois\nelements, assuming the form which it has already reached in the minds of\nmany Socialists and Chartist leaders (who are nearly all Socialists),\nmust, within a short time, play a weighty part in the history of the\ndevelopment of the English people.  English Socialism, the basis of which\nis much more ample than that of the French, is behind it in theoretical\ndevelopment, will have to recede for a moment to the French standpoint in\norder to proceed beyond it later.  Meanwhile the French, too, will\ndevelop farther.  English Socialism affords the most pronounced\nexpression of the prevailing absence of religion among the working-men,\nan expression so pronounced indeed that the mass of the working-men,\nbeing unconsciously and merely practically irreligious, often draw back\nbefore it.  But here, too, necessity will force the working-men to\nabandon the remnants of a belief which, as they will more and more\nclearly perceive, serves only to make them weak and resigned to their\nfate, obedient and faithful to the vampire property-holding class.\n\nHence it is evident that the working-men's movement is divided into two\nsections, the Chartists and the Socialists.  The Chartists are\ntheoretically the more backward, the less developed, but they are genuine\nproletarians all over, the representatives of their class.  The\nSocialists are more far-seeing, propose practical remedies against\ndistress, but, proceeding originally from the bourgeoisie, are for this\nreason unable to amalgamate completely with the working-class.  The union\nof Socialism with Chartism, the reproduction of French Communism in an\nEnglish manner, will be the next step, and has already begun.  Then only,\nwhen this has been achieved, will the working-class be the true\nintellectual leader of England.  Meanwhile, political and social\ndevelopment will proceed, and will foster this new party, this new\ndeparture of Chartism.\n\nThese different sections of working-men, often united, often separated,\nTrades Unionists, Chartists, and Socialists, have founded on their own\nhook numbers of schools and reading-rooms for the advancement of\neducation.  Every Socialist, and almost every Chartist institution, has\nsuch a place, and so too have many trades.  Here the children receive a\npurely proletarian education, free from all the influences of the\nbourgeoisie; and, in the reading-rooms, proletarian journals and books\nalone, or almost alone, are to be found.  These arrangements are very\ndangerous for the bourgeoisie, which has succeeded in withdrawing several\nsuch institutes, \"Mechanics' Institutes,\" from proletarian influences,\nand making them organs for the dissemination of the sciences useful to\nthe bourgeoisie.  Here the natural sciences are now taught, which may\ndraw the working-men away from the opposition to the bourgeoisie, and\nperhaps place in their hands the means of making inventions which bring\nin money for the bourgeoisie; while for the working-man the acquaintance\nwith the natural sciences is utterly useless _now_ when it too often\nhappens that he never gets the slightest glimpse of Nature in his large\ntown with his long working-hours.  Here Political Economy is preached,\nwhose idol is free competition, and whose sum and substance for the\nworking-man is this, that he cannot do anything more rational than resign\nhimself to starvation.  Here all education is tame, flabby, subservient\nto the ruling politics and religion, so that for the working-man it is\nmerely a constant sermon upon quiet obedience, passivity, and resignation\nto his fate.\n\nThe mass of working-men naturally have nothing to do with these\ninstitutes, and betake themselves to the proletarian reading-rooms and to\nthe discussion of matters which directly concern their own interests,\nwhereupon the self-sufficient bourgeoisie says its _Dixi et Salvavi_, and\nturns with contempt from a class which \"prefers the angry ranting of ill-\nmeaning demagogues to the advantages of solid education.\"  That, however,\nthe working-men appreciate solid education when they can get it unmixed\nwith the interested cant of the bourgeoisie, the frequent lectures upon\nscientific, aesthetic, and economic subjects prove which are delivered\nespecially in the Socialist institutes, and very well attended.  I have\noften heard working-men, whose fustian jackets scarcely held together,\nspeak upon geological, astronomical, and other subjects, with more\nknowledge than most \"cultivated\" bourgeois in Germany possess.  And in\nhow great a measure the English proletariat has succeeded in attaining\nindependent education is shown especially by the fact that the\nepoch-making products of modern philosophical, political, and poetical\nliterature are read by working-men almost exclusively.  The bourgeois,\nenslaved by social conditions and the prejudices involved in them,\ntrembles, blesses, and crosses himself before everything which really\npaves the way for progress; the proletarian has open eyes for it, and\nstudies it with pleasure and success.  In this respect the Socialists,\nespecially, have done wonders for the education of the proletariat.  They\nhave translated the French materialists, Helvetius, Holbach, Diderot,\netc., and disseminated them, with the best English works, in cheap\neditions.  Strauss' \"Life of Jesus\" and Proudhon's \"Property\" also\ncirculate among the working-men only.  Shelley, the genius, the prophet,\nShelley, and Byron, with his glowing sensuality and his bitter satire\nupon our existing society, find most of their readers in the proletariat;\nthe bourgeoisie owns only castrated editions, family editions, cut down\nin accordance with the hypocritical morality of to-day.  The two great\npractical philosophers of latest date, Bentham and Godwin, are,\nespecially the latter, almost exclusively the property of the\nproletariat; for though Bentham has a school within the Radical\nbourgeoisie, it is only the proletariat and the Socialists who have\nsucceeded in developing his teachings a step forward.  The proletariat\nhas formed upon this basis a literature, which consists chiefly of\njournals and pamphlets, and is far in advance of the whole bourgeois\nliterature in intrinsic worth.  On this point more later.\n\nOne more point remains to be noticed.  The factory operatives, and\nespecially those of the cotton district, form the nucleus of the labour\nmovement.  Lancashire, and especially Manchester, is the seat of the most\npowerful Unions, the central point of Chartism, the place which numbers\nmost Socialists.  The more the factory system has taken possession of a\nbranch of industry, the more the working-men employed in it participate\nin the labour movement; the sharper the opposition between working-men\nand capitalists, the clearer the proletarian consciousness in the working-\nmen.  The small masters of Birmingham, though they suffer from the\ncrises, still stand upon an unhappy middle ground between proletarian\nChartism and shopkeepers' Radicalism.  But, in general, all the workers\nemployed in manufacture are won for one form or the other of resistance\nto capital and bourgeoisie; and all are united upon this point, that\nthey, as working-men, a title of which they are proud, and which is the\nusual form of address in Chartist meetings, form a separate class, with\nseparate interests and principles, with a separate way of looking at\nthings in contrast with that of all property owners; and that in this\nclass reposes the strength and the capacity of development of the nation.\n\n\n\n\nTHE MINING PROLETARIAT.\n\n\nThe production of raw materials and fuel for a manufacture so colossal as\nthat of England requires a considerable number of workers.  But of all\nthe materials needed for its industries (except wool, which belongs to\nthe agricultural districts), England produces only the minerals: the\nmetals and the coal.  While Cornwall possesses rich copper, tin, zinc,\nand lead mines, Staffordshire, Wales, and other districts yield great\nquantities of iron, and almost the whole North and West of England,\ncentral Scotland, and certain districts of Ireland, produce a\nsuperabundance of coal. {241}\n\nIn the Cornish mines about 19,000 men, and 11,000 women and children are\nemployed, in part above and in part below ground.  Within the mines below\nground, men and boys above twelve years old are employed almost\nexclusively.  The condition of these workers seems, according to the\nChildren's Employment Commission's Reports, to be comparatively\nendurable, materially, and the English often enough boast of their\nstrong, bold miners, who follow the veins of mineral below the bottom of\nthe very sea.  But in the matter of the health of these workers, this\nsame Children's Employment Commission's Report judges differently.  It\nshows in Dr. Barham's intelligent report how the inhalation of an\natmosphere containing little oxygen, and mixed with dust and the smoke of\nblasting powder, such as prevails in the mines, seriously affects the\nlungs, disturbs the action of the heart, and diminishes the activity of\nthe digestive organs; that wearing toil, and especially the climbing up\nand down of ladders, upon which even vigorous young men have to spend in\nsome mines more than an hour a day, and which precedes and follows daily\nwork, contributes greatly to the development of these evils, so that men\nwho begin this work in early youth are far from reaching the stature of\nwomen who work above ground; that many die young of galloping\nconsumption, and most miners at middle age of slow consumption, that they\nage prematurely and become unfit for work between the thirty-fifth and\nforty-fifth years, that many are attacked by acute inflammations of the\nrespiratory organs when exposed to the sudden change from the warm air of\nthe shaft (after climbing the ladder in profuse perspiration), to the\ncold wind above ground, and that these acute inflammations are very\nfrequently fatal.  Work above ground, breaking and sorting the ore, is\ndone by girls and children, and is described as very wholesome, being\ndone in the open air.\n\nIn the North of England, on the borders of Northumberland and Durham, are\nthe extensive lead mines of Alston Moor.  The reports from this district\n{242} agree almost wholly with those from Cornwall.  Here, too, there are\ncomplaints of want of oxygen, excessive dust, powder smoke, carbonic acid\ngas, and sulphur, in the atmosphere of the workings.  In consequence, the\nminers here, as in Cornwall, are small of stature, and nearly all suffer\nfrom the thirtieth year throughout life from chest affections, which end,\nespecially when this work is persisted in, as is almost always the case,\nin consumption, so greatly shortening the average of life of these\npeople.  If the miners of this district are somewhat longer lived than\nthose of Cornwall, this is the case, because they do not enter the mines\nbefore reaching the nineteenth year, while in Cornwall, as we have seen,\nthis work is begun in the twelfth year.  Nevertheless, the majority die\nhere, too, between forty and fifty years of age, according to medical\ntestimony.  Of 79 miners, whose death was entered upon the public\nregister of the district, and who attained an average of 45 years, 37 had\ndied of consumption and 6 of asthma.  In the surrounding districts,\nAllendale, Stanhope, and Middleton, the average length of life was 49,\n48, and 47 years respectively, and the deaths from chest affections\ncomposed 48, 54, and 56 per cent. of the whole number.  Let us compare\nthese figures with the so-called Swedish tables, detailed tables of\nmortality embracing all the inhabitants of Sweden, and recognised in\nEngland as the most correct standard hitherto attainable for the average\nlength of life of the British working-class.  According to them, male\npersons who survive the nineteenth year attain an average of 57.5 years;\nbut, according to this, the North of England miners are robbed by their\nwork of an average of ten years of life.  Yet the Swedish tables are\naccepted as the standard of longevity of the _workers_, and present,\ntherefore, the average chances of life as affected by the unfavourable\nconditions in which the proletariat lives, a standard of longevity less\nthan the normal one.  In this district we find again the lodging-houses\nand sleeping-places with which we have already become acquainted in the\ntowns, and in quite as filthy, disgusting, and overcrowded a state as\nthere.  Commissioner Mitchell visited one such sleeping barrack, 18 feet\nlong, 13 feet wide, and arranged for the reception of 42 men and 14 boys,\nor 56 persons altogether, one-half of whom slept above the other in\nberths as on shipboard.  There was no opening for the escape of the foul\nair; and, although no one had slept in this pen for three nights\npreceding the visit, the smell and the atmosphere were such that\nCommissioner Mitchell could not endure it a moment.  What must it be\nthrough a hot summer night, with fifty-six occupants?  And this is not\nthe steerage of an American slave ship, it is the dwelling of free-born\nBritons!\n\nLet us turn now to the most important branch of British mining, the iron\nand coal mines, which the Children's Employment Commission treats in\ncommon, and with all the detail which the importance of the subject\ndemands.  Nearly the whole of the first part of this report is devoted to\nthe condition of the workers employed in these mines.  After the detailed\ndescription which I have furnished of the state of the industrial\nworkers, I shall, however, be able to be as brief in dealing with this\nsubject as the scope of the present work requires.\n\nIn the coal and iron mines which are worked in pretty much the same way,\nchildren of four, five, and seven years are employed.  They are set to\ntransporting the ore or coal loosened by the miner from its place to the\nhorse-path or the main shaft, and to opening and shutting the doors\n(which separate the divisions of the mine and regulate its ventilation)\nfor the passage of workers and material.  For watching the doors the\nsmallest children are usually employed, who thus pass twelve hours daily,\nin the dark, alone, sitting usually in damp passages without even having\nwork enough to save them from the stupefying, brutalising tedium of doing\nnothing.  The transport of coal and iron-stone, on the other hand, is\nvery hard labour, the stuff being shoved in large tubs, without wheels,\nover the uneven floor of the mine; often over moist clay, or through\nwater, and frequently up steep inclines and through paths so low-roofed\nthat the workers are forced to creep on hands and knees.  For this more\nwearing labour, therefore, older children and half-grown girls are\nemployed.  One man or two boys per tub are employed, according to\ncircumstances; and, if two boys, one pushes and the other pulls.  The\nloosening of the ore or coal, which is done by men or strong youths of\nsixteen years or more, is also very weary work.  The usual working-day is\neleven to twelve hours, often longer; in Scotland it reaches fourteen\nhours, and double time is frequent, when all the employees are at work\nbelow ground twenty-four, and even thirty-six hours at a stretch.  Set\ntimes for meals are almost unknown, so that these people eat when hunger\nand time permit.\n\nThe standard of living of the miners is in general described as fairly\ngood and their wages high in comparison with those of the agricultural\nlabourers surrounding them (who, however, live at starvation rates),\nexcept in certain parts of Scotland and in the Irish mines, where great\nmisery prevails.  We shall have occasion to return later to this\nstatement, which, by the way, is merely relative, implying comparison to\nthe poorest class in all England.  Meanwhile, we shall consider the evils\nwhich arise from the present method of mining, and the reader may judge\nwhether any pay in money can indemnify the miner for such suffering.\n\nThe children and young people who are employed in transporting coal and\niron-stone all complain of being over-tired.  Even in the most recklessly\nconducted industrial establishments there is no such universal and\nexaggerated overwork.  The whole report proves this, with a number of\nexamples on every page.  It is constantly happening that children throw\nthemselves down on the stone hearth or the floor as soon as they reach\nhome, fall asleep at once without being able to take a bite of food, and\nhave to be washed and put to bed while asleep; it even happens that they\nlie down on the way home, and are found by their parents late at night\nasleep on the road.  It seems to be a universal practice among these\nchildren to spend Sunday in bed to recover in some degree from the over-\nexertion of the week.  Church and school are visited by but few, and even\nof these the teachers complain of their great sleepiness and the want of\nall eagerness to learn.  The same thing is true of the elder girls and\nwomen.  They are overworked in the most brutal manner.  This weariness,\nwhich is almost always carried to a most painful pitch, cannot fail to\naffect the constitution.  The first result of such over-exertion is the\ndiversion of vitality to the one-sided development of the muscles, so\nthat those especially of the arms, legs, and back, of the shoulders and\nchest, which are chiefly called into activity in pushing and pulling,\nattain an uncommonly vigorous development, while all the rest of the body\nsuffers and is atrophied from want of nourishment.  More than all else\nthe stature suffers, being stunted and retarded; nearly all miners are\nshort, except those of Leicestershire and Warwickshire, who work under\nexceptionally favourable conditions.  Further, among boys as well as\ngirls, puberty is retarded, among the former often until the eighteenth\nyear; indeed, a nineteen years old boy appeared before Commissioner\nSymonds, showing no evidence beyond that of the teeth, that he was more\nthan eleven or twelve years old.  This prolongation of the period of\nchildhood is at bottom nothing more than a sign of checked development,\nwhich does not fail to bear fruit in later years.  Distortions of the\nlegs, knees bent inwards and feet bent outwards, deformities of the\nspinal column and other malformations, appear the more readily in\nconstitutions thus weakened, in consequence of the almost universally\nconstrained position during work; and they are so frequent that in\nYorkshire and Lancashire, as in Northumberland and Durham, the assertion\nis made by many witnesses, not only by physicians, that a miner may be\nrecognised by his shape among a hundred other persons.  The women seem to\nsuffer especially from this work, and are seldom, if ever, as straight as\nother women.  There is testimony here, too, to the fact that deformities\nof the pelvis and consequent difficult, even fatal, childbearing arise\nfrom the work of women in the mines.  But apart from these local\ndeformities, the coal miners suffer from a number of special affections\neasily explained by the nature of the work.  Diseases of the digestive\norgans are first in order; want of appetite, pains in the stomach,\nnausea, and vomiting, are most frequent, with violent thirst, which can\nbe quenched only with the dirty, lukewarm water of the mine; the\ndigestion is checked and all the other affections are thus invited.\nDiseases of the heart, especially hypertrophy, inflammation of the heart\nand pericardium, contraction of the _auriculo-ventricular_ communications\nand the entrance of the _aorta_ are also mentioned repeatedly as diseases\nof the miners, and are readily explained by overwork; and the same is\ntrue of the almost universal rupture which is a direct consequence of\nprotracted over-exertion.  In part from the same cause and in part from\nthe bad, dust-filled atmosphere mixed with carbonic acid and hydrocarbon\ngas, which might so readily be avoided, there arise numerous painful and\ndangerous affections of the lungs, especially asthma, which in some\ndistricts appears in the fortieth, in others in the thirtieth year in\nmost of the miners, and makes them unfit for work in a short time.  Among\nthose employed in wet workings the oppression in the chest naturally\nappears much earlier; in some districts of Scotland between the twentieth\nand thirtieth years, during which time the affected lungs are especially\nsusceptible to inflammations and diseases of a feverish nature.  The\npeculiar disease of workers of this sort is \"black spittle,\" which arises\nfrom the saturation of the whole lung with coal particles, and manifests\nitself in general debility, headache, oppression of the chest, and thick,\nblack mucous expectoration.  In some districts this disease appears in a\nmild form; in others, on the contrary, it is wholly incurable, especially\nin Scotland.  Here, besides the symptoms just mentioned, which appear in\nan intensified form, short, wheezing, breathing, rapid pulse (exceeding\n100 per minute), and abrupt coughing, with increasing leanness and\ndebility, speedily make the patient unfit for work.  Every case of this\ndisease ends fatally.  Dr. Mackellar, in Pencaitland, East Lothian,\ntestified that in all the coal mines which are properly ventilated this\ndisease is unknown, while it frequently happens that miners who go from\nwell to ill-ventilated mines are seized by it.  The profit-greed of mine\nowners which prevents the use of ventilators is therefore responsible for\nthe fact that this working-men's disease exists at all.  Rheumatism, too,\nis, with the exception of the Warwick and Leicestershire workers, a\nuniversal disease of the coal miners, and arises especially from the\nfrequently damp working-places.  The consequence of all these diseases is\nthat, in all districts _without exception_, the coal miners age early and\nbecome unfit for work soon after the fortieth year, though this is\ndifferent in different places.  A coal miner who can follow his calling\nafter the 45th or 50th year is a very great rarity indeed.  It is\nuniversally recognised that such workers enter upon old age at forty.\nThis applies to those who loosen the coal from the bed; the loaders, who\nhave constantly to lift heavy blocks of coal into the tubs, age with the\ntwenty-eighth or thirtieth year, so that it is proverbial in the coal\nmining districts that the loaders are old before they are young.  That\nthis premature old age is followed by the early death of the colliers is\na matter of course, and a man who reaches sixty is a great exception\namong them.  Even in South Staffordshire, where the mines are\ncomparatively wholesome, few men reach their fifty-first year.  Along\nwith this early superannuation of the workers we naturally find, just as\nin the case of the mills, frequent lack of employment of the elder men,\nwho are often supported by very young children.  If we sum up briefly the\nresults of the work in coal mines, we find, as Dr. Southwood Smith, one\nof the commissioners, does, that through prolonged childhood on the one\nhand and premature age on the other, that period of life in which the\nhuman being is in full possession of his powers, the period of manhood,\nis greatly shortened, while the length of life in general is below the\naverage.  This, too, on the debit side of the bourgeoisie's reckoning!\n\nAll this deals only with the average of the English coal mines.  But\nthere are many in which the state of things is much worse, those, namely,\nin which thin seams of coal are worked.  The coal would be too expensive\nif a part of the adjacent sand and clay were removed; so the mine owners\npermit only the seams to be worked; whereby the passages which elsewhere\nare four or five feet high and more are here kept so low that to stand\nupright in them is not to be thought of.  The working-man lies on his\nside and loosens the coal with his pick; resting upon his elbow as a\npivot, whence follow inflammations of the joint, and in cases where he is\nforced to kneel, of the knee also.  The women and children who have to\ntransport the coal crawl upon their hands and knees, fastened to the tub\nby a harness and chain (which frequently passes between the legs), while\na man behind pushes with hands and head.  The pushing with the head\nengenders local irritations, painful swellings, and ulcers.  In many\ncases, too, the shafts are wet, so that these workers have to crawl\nthrough dirty or salt water several inches deep, being thus exposed to a\nspecial irritation of the skin.  It can be readily imagined how greatly\nthe diseases already peculiar to the miners are fostered by this\nespecially frightful, slavish toil.\n\nBut these are not all the evils which descend upon the head of the coal\nminer.  In the whole British Empire there is no occupation in which a man\nmay meet his end in so many diverse ways as in this one.  The coal mine\nis the scene of a multitude of the most terrifying calamities, and these\ncome directly from the selfishness of the bourgeoisie.  The hydrocarbon\ngas which develops so freely in these mines, forms, when combined with\natmospheric air, an explosive which takes fire upon coming into contact\nwith a flame, and kills every one within its reach.  Such explosions take\nplace, in one mine or another, nearly every day; on September 28th, 1844,\none killed 96 men in Haswell Colliery, Durham.  The carbonic acid gas,\nwhich also develops in great quantities, accumulates in the deeper parts\nof the mine, frequently reaching the height of a man, and suffocates\nevery one who gets into it.  The doors which separate the sections of the\nmines are meant to prevent the propagation of explosions and the movement\nof the gases; but since they are entrusted to small children, who often\nfall asleep or neglect them, this means of prevention is illusory.  A\nproper ventilation of the mines by means of fresh air-shafts could almost\nentirely remove the injurious effects of both these gases.  But for this\npurpose the bourgeoisie has no money to spare, preferring to command the\nworking-men to use the Davy lamp, which is wholly useless because of its\ndull light, and is, therefore, usually replaced by a candle.  If an\nexplosion occurs, the recklessness of the miner is blamed, though the\nbourgeois might have made the explosion well-nigh impossible by supplying\ngood ventilation.  Further, every few days the roof of a working falls\nin, and buries or mangles the workers employed in it.  It is the interest\nof the bourgeois to have the seams worked out as completely as possible,\nand hence the accidents of this sort.  Then, too, the ropes by which the\nmen descend into the mines are often rotten, and break, so that the\nunfortunates fall, and are crushed.  All these accidents, and I have no\nroom for special cases, carry off yearly, according to the _Mining\nJournal_, some fourteen hundred human beings.  The _Manchester Guardian_\nreports at least two or three accidents every week for Lancashire alone.\nIn nearly all mining districts the people composing the coroner's juries\nare, in almost all cases, dependent upon the mine owners, and where this\nis not the case, immemorial custom insures that the verdict shall be:\n\"Accidental Death.\"  Besides, the jury takes very little interest in the\nstate of the mine, because it does not understand anything about the\nmatter.  But the Children's Employment Commission does not hesitate to\nmake the mine owners directly responsible for the greater number of these\ncases.\n\nAs to the education and morals of the mining population, they are,\naccording to the Children's Employment Commission, pretty good in\nCornwall, and excellent in Alston Moor; in the coal districts, in\ngeneral, they are, on the contrary, reported as on an excessively low\nplane.  The workers live in the country in neglected regions, and if they\ndo their weary work, no human being outside the police force troubles\nhimself about them.  Hence, and from the tender age at which children are\nput to work, it follows that their mental education is wholly neglected.\nThe day schools are not within their reach, the evening and Sunday\nschools mere shams, the teachers worthless.  Hence, few can read and\nstill fewer write.  The only point upon which their eyes are as yet open\nis the fact that their wages are far too low for their hateful and\ndangerous work.  To church they go seldom or never; all the clergy\ncomplain of their irreligion as beyond comparison.  As a matter of fact,\ntheir ignorance of religious and of secular things, alike, is such that\nthe ignorance of the factory operatives, shown in numerous examples in\nthe foregoing pages, is trifling in comparison with it.  The categories\nof religion are known to them only from the terms of their oaths.  Their\nmorality is destroyed by their work itself.  That the overwork of all\nminers must engender drunkenness is self-evident.  As to their sexual\nrelations, men, women, and children work in the mines, in many cases,\nwholly naked, and in most cases, nearly so, by reason of the prevailing\nheat, and the consequences in the dark, lonely mines may be imagined.  The\nnumber of illegitimate children is here disproportionately large, and\nindicates what goes on among the half-savage population below ground; but\nproves too, that the illegitimate intercourse of the sexes has not here,\nas in the great cities, sunk to the level of prostitution.  The labour of\nwomen entails the same consequences as in the factories, dissolves the\nfamily, and makes the mother totally incapable of household work.\n\nWhen the Children's Employment Commission's Report was laid before\nParliament, Lord Ashley hastened to bring in a bill wholly forbidding the\nwork of women in the mines, and greatly limiting that of children.  The\nbill was adopted, but has remained a dead letter in most districts,\nbecause no mine inspectors were appointed to watch over its being carried\ninto effect.  The evasion of the law is very easy in the country\ndistricts in which the mines are situated; and no one need be surprised\nthat the Miners' Union laid before the Home Secretary an official notice,\nlast year, that in the Duke of Hamilton's coal mines in Scotland, more\nthan sixty women were at work; or that the _Manchester Guardian_ reported\nthat a girl perished in an explosion in a mine near Wigan, and no one\ntroubled himself further about the fact that an infringement of the law\nwas thus revealed.  In single cases the employment of women may have been\ndiscontinued, but in general the old state of things remains as before.\n\nThese are, however, not all the afflictions known to the coal miners.  The\nbourgeoisie, not content with ruining the health of these people, keeping\nthem in danger of sudden loss of life, robbing them of all opportunity\nfor education, plunders them in other directions in the most shameless\nmanner.  The truck system is here the rule, not the exception, and is\ncarried on in the most direct and undisguised manner.  The cottage\nsystem, likewise, is universal, and here almost a necessity; but it is\nused here, too, for the better plundering of the workers.  To these means\nof oppression must be added all sorts of direct cheating.  While coal is\nsold by weight, the worker's wages are reckoned chiefly by measure; and\nwhen his tub is not perfectly full he receives no pay whatever, while he\ngets not a farthing for over-measure.  If there is more than a specified\nquantity of dust in the tub, a matter which depends much less upon the\nminer than upon the nature of the seam, he not only loses his whole wage\nbut is fined besides.  The fine system in general is so highly perfected\nin the coal mines, that a poor devil who has worked the whole week and\ncomes for his wages, sometimes learns from the overseer, who fine at\ndiscretion and without summoning the workers, that he not only has no\nwages but must pay so and so much in fines extra!  The overseer has, in\ngeneral, absolute power over wages; he notes the work done, and can\nplease himself as to what he pays the worker, who is forced to take his\nword.  In some mines, where the pay is according to weight, false decimal\nscales are used, whose weights are not subject to the inspection of the\nauthorities; in one coal mine there was actually a regulation that any\nworkman who intended to complain of the falseness of the scales _must\ngive notice to the overseer three weeks in advance_!  In many districts,\nespecially in the North of England, it is customary to engage the workers\nby the year; they pledge themselves to work for no other employer during\nthat time, but the mine owner by no means pledges himself to give them\nwork, so that they are often without it for months together, and if they\nseek elsewhere, they are sent to the treadmill for six weeks for breach\nof contract.  In other contracts, work to the amount of 26s. every 14\ndays, is promised the miners, but not furnished, in others still, the\nemployers advance the miners small sums to be worked out afterwards, thus\nbinding the debtors to themselves.  In the North, the custom is general\nof keeping the payment of wages one week behindhand, chaining the miners\nin this way to their work.  And to complete the slavery of these\nenthralled workers, nearly all the Justices of the Peace in the coal\ndistricts are mine owners themselves, or relatives or friends of mine\nowners, and possess almost unlimited power in these poor, uncivilised\nregions where there are few newspapers, these few in the service of the\nruling class, and but little other agitation.  It is almost beyond\nconception how these poor coal miners have been plundered and tyrannised\nover by Justices of the Peace acting as judges in their own cause.\n\nSo it went on for a long time.  The workers did not know any better than\nthat they were there for the purpose of being swindled out of their very\nlives.  But gradually, even among them, and especially in the factory\ndistricts, where contact with the more intelligent operatives could not\nfail of its effect, there arose a spirit of opposition to the shameless\noppression of the \"coal kings.\"  The men began to form Unions and strike\nfrom time to time.  In civilised districts they joined the Chartists body\nand soul.  The great coal district of the North of England, shut off from\nall industrial intercourse, remained backward until, after many efforts,\npartly of the Chartists and partly of the more intelligent miners\nthemselves, a general spirit of opposition arose in 1843.  Such a\nmovement seized the workers of Northumberland and Durham that they placed\nthemselves at the forefront of a general Union of coal miners throughout\nthe kingdom, and appointed W. P. Roberts, a Chartist solicitor, of\nBristol, their \"Attorney General,\" he having distinguished himself in\nearlier Chartist trials.  The Union soon spread over a great majority of\nthe districts; agents were appointed in all directions, who held meetings\neverywhere and secured new members; at the first conference of delegates,\nin Manchester, in 1844, there were 60,000 members represented, and at\nGlasgow, six months later, at the second conference, 100,000.  Here all\nthe affairs of the coal miners were discussed and decisions as to the\ngreater strikes arrived at.  Several journals were founded, especially\nthe _Miners' Advocate_, at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, for defending the rights\nof the miners.  On March 31st, 1844, the contracts of all the miners of\nNorthumberland and Durham expired.  Roberts was empowered to draw up a\nnew agreement, in which the men demanded: (1) Payment by weight instead\nof measure; (2) Determination of weight by means of ordinary scales\nsubject to the public inspectors; (3) Half-yearly renewal of contracts;\n(4) Abolition of the fines system and payment according to work actually\ndone; (5) The employers to guarantee to miners in their exclusive service\nat least four days' work per week, or wages for the same.  This agreement\nwas submitted to the \"coal kings,\" and a deputation appointed to\nnegotiate with them; they answered, however, that for them the Union did\nnot exist, that they had to deal with single workmen only, and should\nnever recognise the Union.  They also submitted an agreement of their own\nwhich ignored all the foregoing points, and was, naturally, refused by\nthe miners.  War was thus declared.  On March 31st, 1844, 40,000 miners\nlaid down their picks, and every mine in the county stood empty.  The\nfunds of the Union were so considerable that for several months a weekly\ncontribution of 2s. 6d. could be assured to each family.  While the\nminers were thus putting the patience of their masters to the test,\nRoberts organised with incomparable perseverance both strike and\nagitation, arranged for the holding of meetings, traversed England from\none end to the other, preached peaceful and legal agitation, and carried\non a crusade against the despotic Justices of the Peace and truck\nmasters, such as had never been known in England.  This he had begun at\nthe beginning of the year.  Wherever a miner had been condemned by a\nJustice of the Peace, he obtained a _habeas corpus_ from the Court of\nQueen's bench, brought his client to London, and always secured an\nacquittal.  Thus, January 13th, Judge Williams of Queen's bench acquitted\nthree miners condemned by the Justices of the Peace of Bilston, South\nStaffordshire; the offence of these people was that they refused to work\nin a place which threatened to cave in, and had actually caved in before\ntheir return!  On an earlier occasion, Judge Patteson had acquitted six\nworking-men, so that the name Roberts began to be a terror to the mine\nowners.  In Preston four of his clients were in jail.  In the first week\nof January he proceeded thither to investigate the case on the spot, but\nfound, when he arrived, the condemned all released before the expiration\nof the sentence.  In Manchester there were seven in jail; Roberts\nobtained a _habeas corpus_ and acquittal for all from Judge Wightman.  In\nPrescott nine coal miners were in jail, accused of creating a disturbance\nin St. Helen's, South Lancashire, and awaiting trial; when Roberts\narrived upon the spot, they were released at once.  All this took place\nin the first half of February.  In April, Roberts released a miner from\njail in Derby, four in Wakefield, and four in Leicester.  So it went on\nfor a time until these Dogberries came to have some respect for the\nminers.  The truck system shared the same fate.  One after another\nRoberts brought the disreputable mine owners before the courts, and\ncompelled the reluctant Justices of the Peace to condemn them; such dread\nof this \"lightning\" \"Attorney General\" who seemed to be everywhere at\nonce spread among them, that at Belper, for instance, upon Roberts'\narrival, a truck firm published the following notice:\n\n   \"NOTICE!\"\n\n   \"PENTRICH COAL MINE.\n\n   \"The Messrs. Haslam think it necessary, in order to prevent all\n   mistakes, to announce that all persons employed in their colliery will\n   receive their wages wholly in cash, and may expend them when and as\n   they choose to do.  If they purchase goods in the shops of Messrs.\n   Haslam they will receive them as heretofore at wholesale prices, but\n   they are not expected to make their purchases there, and work and\n   wages will be continued as usual whether purchases are made in these\n   shops or elsewhere.\"\n\nThis triumph aroused the greatest jubilation throughout the English\nworking-class, and brought the Union a mass of new members.  Meanwhile\nthe strike in the North was proceeding.  Not a hand stirred, and\nNewcastle, the chief coal port, was so stripped of its commodity that\ncoal had to be brought from the Scotch coast, in spite of the proverb.  At\nfirst, while the Union's funds held out, all went well, but towards\nsummer the struggle became much more painful for the miners.  The\ngreatest want prevailed among them; they had no money, for the\ncontributions of the workers of all branches of industry in England\navailed little among the vast number of strikers, who were forced to\nborrow from the small shopkeepers at a heavy loss.  The whole press, with\nthe single exception of the few proletarian journals, was against them;\nthe bourgeois, even the few among them who might have had enough sense of\njustice to support the miners, learnt from the corrupt Liberal and\nConservative sheets only lies about them.  A deputation of twelve miners\nwho went to London received a sum from the proletariat there, but this,\ntoo, availed little among the mass who needed support.  Yet, in spite of\nall this, the miners remained steadfast, and what is even more\nsignificant, were quiet and peaceable in the face of all the hostilities\nand provocation of the mine owners and their faithful servants.  No act\nof revenge was carried out, not a renegade was maltreated, not one single\ntheft committed.  Thus the strike had continued well on towards four\nmonths, and the mine owners still had no prospect of getting the upper\nhand.  One way was, however, still open to them.  They remembered the\ncottage system; it occurred to them that the houses of the rebellious\nspirits were THEIR property.  In July, notice to quit was served the\nworkers, and, in a week, the whole forty thousand were put out of doors.\nThis measure was carried out with revolting cruelty.  The sick, the\nfeeble, old men and little children, even women in childbirth, were\nmercilessly turned from their beds and cast into the roadside ditches.\nOne agent dragged by the hair from her bed, and into the street, a woman\nin the pangs of childbirth.  Soldiers and police in crowds were present,\nready to fire at the first symptom of resistance, on the slightest hint\nof the Justices of the Peace, who had brought about the whole brutal\nprocedure.  This, too, the working-men endured without resistance.  The\nhope had been that the men would use violence; they were spurred on with\nall force to infringements of the laws, to furnish an excuse for making\nan end of the strike by the intervention of the military.  The homeless\nminers, remembering the warnings of their Attorney General, remained\nunmoved, set up their household goods upon the moors or the harvested\nfields, and held out.  Some, who had no other place, encamped on the\nroadsides and in ditches, others upon land belonging to other people,\nwhereupon they were prosecuted, and, having caused \"damage of the value\nof a halfpenny,\" were fined a pound, and, being unable to pay it, worked\nit out on the treadmill.  Thus they lived eight weeks and more of the wet\nfag-end of last summer under the open sky with their families, with no\nfurther shelter for themselves and their little ones than the calico\ncurtains of their beds; with no other help than the scanty allowances of\ntheir Union and the fast shrinking credit with the small dealers.\nHereupon Lord Londonderry, who owns considerable mines in Durham,\nthreatened the small tradesmen in \"his\" town of Seaham with his most high\ndispleasure if they should continue to give credit to \"his\" rebellious\nworkers.  This \"noble\" lord made himself the first clown of the turnout\nin consequence of the ridiculous, pompous, ungrammatical ukases addressed\nto the workers, which he published from time to time, with no other\nresult than the merriment of the nation.  When none of their efforts\nproduced any effect, the mine owners imported, at great expense, hands\nfrom Ireland and such remote parts of Wales as have as yet no labour\nmovement.  And when the competition of workers against workers was thus\nrestored, the strength of the strikers collapsed.  The mine owners\nobliged them to renounce the Union, abandon Roberts, and accept the\nconditions laid down by the employers.  Thus ended at the close of\nSeptember the great five months' battle of the coal miners against the\nmine owners, a battle fought on the part of the oppressed with an\nendurance, courage, intelligence, and coolness which demands the highest\nadmiration.  What a degree of true human culture, of enthusiasm and\nstrength of character, such a battle implies on the part of men who, as\nwe have seen in the Children's Employment Commission's Report, were\ndescribed as late as 1840, as being thoroughly brutal and wanting in\nmoral sense!  But how hard, too, must have been the pressure which\nbrought these forty thousand colliers to rise as one man and to fight out\nthe battle like an army not only well-disciplined but enthusiastic, an\narmy possessed of one single determination, with the greatest coolness\nand composure, to a point beyond which further resistance would have been\nmadness.  And what a battle!  Not against visible, mortal enemies, but\nagainst hunger, want, misery, and homelessness, against their own\npassions provoked to madness by the brutality of wealth.  If they had\nrevolted with violence, they, the unarmed and defenceless, would have\nbeen shot down, and a day or two would have decided the victory of the\nowners.  This law-abiding reserve was no fear of the constable's staff,\nit was the result of deliberation, the best proof of the intelligence and\nself-control of the working-men.\n\nThus were the working-men forced once more, in spite of their unexampled\nendurance, to succumb to the might of capital.  But the fight had not\nbeen in vain.  First of all, this nineteen weeks' strike had torn the\nminers of the North of England forever from the intellectual death in\nwhich they had hitherto lain; they have left their sleep, are alert to\ndefend their interests, and have entered the movement of civilisation,\nand especially the movement of the workers.  The strike, which first\nbrought to light the whole cruelty of the owners, has established the\nopposition of the workers here, forever, and made at least two-thirds of\nthem Chartists; and the acquisition of thirty thousand such determined,\nexperienced men is certainly of great value to the Chartists.  Then, too,\nthe endurance and law-abiding which characterised the whole strike,\ncoupled with the active agitation which accompanied it, has fixed public\nattention upon the miners.  On the occasion of the debate upon the export\nduty on coal, Thomas Duncombe, the only decidedly Chartist member of the\nHouse of Commons, brought up the condition of the coal miners, had their\npetition read, and by his speech forced the bourgeois journals to\npublish, at least in their reports of Parliamentary proceedings, a\ncorrect statement of the case.  Immediately after the strike, occurred\nthe explosion at Haswell; Roberts went to London, demanded an audience\nwith Peel, insisted as representative of the miners upon a thorough\ninvestigation of the case, and succeeded in having the first geological\nand chemical notabilities of England, Professors Lyell and Faraday,\ncommissioned to visit the spot.  As several other explosions followed in\nquick succession, and Roberts again laid the details before the Prime\nMinister, the latter promised to propose the necessary measures for the\nprotection of the workers, if possible, in the next session of\nParliament, _i.e_., the present one of 1845.  All this would not have\nbeen accomplished if these workers had not, by means of the strike,\nproved themselves freedom-loving men worthy of all respect, and if they\nhad not engaged Roberts as their counsel.\n\nScarcely had it become known that the coal miners of the North had been\nforced to renounce the Union and discharge Roberts, when the miners of\nLancashire formed a Union of some ten thousand men, and guaranteed their\nAttorney General a salary of 1200 pounds a year.  In the autumn of last\nyear they collected more than 700 pounds, rather more than 200 pounds of\nwhich they expended upon salaries and judicial expenses, and the rest\nchiefly in support of men out of work, either through want of employment\nor through dissensions with their employers.  Thus the working-men are\nconstantly coming to see more clearly that, united, they too are a\nrespectable power, and can, in the last extremity, defy even the might of\nthe bourgeoisie.  And this insight, the gain of all labour movements, has\nbeen won for all the miners of England by the Union and the strike of\n1844.  In a very short time the difference of intelligence and energy\nwhich now exists in favour of the factory operatives will have vanished,\nand the miners of the kingdom will be able to stand abreast of them in\nevery respect.  Thus one piece of standing ground after another is\nundermined beneath the feet of the bourgeoisie; and how long will it be\nbefore their whole social and political edifice collapses with the basis\nupon which it rests? {259}\n\nBut the bourgeoisie will not take warning.  The resistance of the miners\ndoes but embitter it the more.  Instead of appreciating this forward step\nin the general movement of the workers, the property-holding class saw in\nit only a source of rage against a class of people who are fools enough\nto declare themselves no longer submissive to the treatment they had\nhitherto received.  It saw in the just demands of the non-possessing\nworkers only impertinent discontent, mad rebellion against \"Divine and\nhuman order;\" and, in the best case, a success (to be resisted by the\nbourgeoisie with all its might) won by \"ill-intentioned demagogues who\nlive by agitation and are too lazy to work.\"  It sought, of course,\nwithout success, to represent to the workers that Roberts and the Union's\nagents whom the Union very naturally had to pay, were insolent swindlers,\nwho drew the last farthing from the working-men's pockets.  When such\ninsanity prevails in the property-holding class, when it is so blinded by\nits momentary profit that it no longer has eyes for the most conspicuous\nsigns of the times, surely all hope of a peaceful solution of the social\nquestion for England must be abandoned.  The only possible solution is a\nviolent revolution, which cannot fail to take place.\n\n\n\n\nTHE AGRICULTURAL PROLETARIAT.\n\n\nWe have seen in the introduction how, simultaneously with the small\nbourgeoisie and the modest independence of the former workers, the small\npeasantry also was ruined when the former Union of industrial and\nagricultural work was dissolved, the abandoned fields thrown together\ninto large farms, and the small peasants superseded by the overwhelming\ncompetition of the large farmers.  Instead of being landowners or\nleaseholders, as they had been hitherto, they were now obliged to hire\nthemselves as labourers to the large farmers or the landlords.  For a\ntime this position was endurable, though a deterioration in comparison\nwith their former one.  The extension of industry kept pace with the\nincrease of population until the progress of manufacture began to assume\na slower pace, and the perpetual improvement of machinery made it\nimpossible for manufacture to absorb the whole surplus of the\nagricultural population.  From this time forward, the distress which had\nhitherto existed only in the manufacturing districts, and then only at\ntimes, appeared in the agricultural districts too.  The twenty-five\nyears' struggle with France came to an end at about the same time; the\ndiminished production at the various seats of the wars, the shutting off\nof imports, and the necessity of providing for the British army in Spain,\nhad given English agriculture an artificial prosperity, and had besides\nwithdrawn to the army vast numbers of workers from their ordinary\noccupations.  This check upon the import trade, the opportunity for\nexportation, and the military demand for workers, now suddenly came to an\nend; and the necessary consequence was what the English call agricultural\ndistress.  The farmers had to sell their corn at low prices, and could,\ntherefore, pay only low wages.  In 1815, in order to keep up prices, the\nCorn Laws were passed, prohibiting the importation of corn so long as the\nprice of wheat continued less than 80 shillings per quarter.  These\nnaturally ineffective laws were several times modified, but did not\nsucceed in ameliorating the distress in the agricultural districts.  All\nthat they did was to change the disease, which, under free competition\nfrom abroad, would have assumed an acute form, culminating in a series of\ncrises, into a chronic one which bore heavily but uniformly upon the farm\nlabourers.\n\nFor a time after the rise of the agricultural proletariat, the\npatriarchal relation between master and man, which was being destroyed\nfor manufacture, developed here the same relation of the farmer to his\nhands which still exists almost everywhere in Germany.  So long as this\nlasted, the poverty of the farm hands was less conspicuous; they shared\nthe fate of the farmer, and were discharged only in cases of the direst\nnecessity.  But now all this is changed.  The farm hands have become day\nlabourers almost everywhere, are employed only when needed by the\nfarmers, and, therefore, often have no work for weeks together,\nespecially in winter.  In the patriarchal time, the hands and their\nfamilies lived on the farm, and their children grew up there, the farmer\ntrying to find occupation on the spot for the oncoming generation; day\nlabourers, then, were the exception, not the rule.  Thus there was, on\nevery farm, a larger number of hands than were strictly necessary.  It\nbecame, therefore, the interest of the farmers to dissolve this relation,\ndrive the farm hand from the farm, and transform him into a day labourer.\nThis took place pretty generally towards the year 1830, and the\nconsequence was that the hitherto latent over-population was set free,\nthe rate of wages forced down, and the poor-rate enormously increased.\nFrom this time the agricultural districts became the headquarters of\npermanent, as the manufacturing districts had long been of periodic,\npauperism; and the modification of the Poor Law was the first measure\nwhich the State was obliged to apply to the daily increasing\nimpoverishment of the country parishes.  Moreover, the constant extension\nof farming on a large scale, the introduction of threshing and other\nmachines, and the employment of women and children (which is now so\ngeneral that its effects have recently been investigated by a special\nofficial commission), threw a large number of men out of employment.  It\nis manifest, therefore, that here, too, the system of industrial\nproduction has made its entrance, by means of farming on a large scale,\nby the abolition of the patriarchal relation, which is of the greatest\nimportance just here, by the introduction of machinery, steam, and the\nlabour of women and children.  In so doing, it has swept the last and\nmost stationary portion of working humanity into the revolutionary\nmovement.  But the longer agriculture had remained stationary, the\nheavier now became the burden upon the worker, the more violently broke\nforth the results of the disorganisation of the old social fabric.  The\n\"over-population\" came to light all at once, and could not, as in the\nmanufacturing districts, be absorbed by the needs of an increasing\nproduction.  New factories could always be built, if there were consumers\nfor their products, but new land could not be created.  The cultivation\nof waste common land was too daring a speculation for the bad times\nfollowing the conclusion of peace.  The necessary consequence was that\nthe competition of the workers among each other reached the highest point\nof intensity, and wages fell to the minimum.  So long as the old Poor Law\nexisted, the workers received relief from the rates; wages naturally fell\nstill lower, because the farmers forced the largest possible number of\nlabourers to claim relief.  The higher poor-rate, necessitated by the\nsurplus population, was only increased by this measure, and the new Poor\nLaw, of which we shall have more to say later, was now enacted as a\nremedy.  But this did not improve matters.  Wages did not rise, the\nsurplus population could not be got rid of, and the cruelty of the new\nlaw did but serve to embitter the people to the utmost.  Even the poor-\nrate, which diminished at first after the passage of the new law,\nattained its old height after a few years.  Its only effect was that\nwhereas previously three to four million half paupers had existed, a\nmillion of total paupers now appeared, and the rest, still half paupers,\nmerely went without relief.  The poverty in the agricultural districts\nhas increased every year.  The people live in the greatest want, whole\nfamilies must struggle along with 6, 7, or 8 shillings a week, and at\ntimes have nothing.  Let us hear a description of this population given\nby a Liberal member of Parliament as early as 1830. {264}\n\n   \"An English agricultural labourer and an English pauper, these words\n   are synonymous.  His father was a pauper and his mother's milk\n   contained no nourishment.  From his earliest childhood he had bad\n   food, and only half enough to still his hunger, and even yet he\n   undergoes the pangs of unsatisfied hunger almost all the time that he\n   is not asleep.  He is half clad, and has not more fire than barely\n   suffices to cook his scanty meal.  And so cold and damp are always at\n   home with him, and leave him only in fine weather.  He is married, but\n   he knows nothing of the joys of the husband and father.  His wife and\n   children, hungry, rarely warm, often ill and helpless, always careworn\n   and hopeless like himself, are naturally grasping, selfish, and\n   troublesome, and so, to use his own expression, he hates the sight of\n   them, and enters his cot only because it offers him a trifle more\n   shelter from rain and wind than a hedge.  He must support his family,\n   though he cannot do so, whence come beggary, deceit of all sorts,\n   ending in fully developed craftiness.  If he were so inclined, he yet\n   has not the courage which makes of the more energetic of his class\n   wholesale poachers and smugglers.  But he pilfers when occasion\n   offers, and teaches his children to lie and steal.  His abject and\n   submissive demeanour towards his wealthy neighbours shows that they\n   treat him roughly and with suspicion; hence he fears and hates them,\n   but he never will injure them by force.  He is depraved through and\n   through, too far gone to possess even the strength of despair.  His\n   wretched existence is brief, rheumatism and asthma bring him to the\n   workhouse, where he will draw his last breath without a single\n   pleasant recollection, and will make room for another luckless wretch\n   to live and die as he has done.\"\n\nOur author adds that besides this class of agricultural labourers, there\nis still another, somewhat more energetic and better endowed physically,\nmentally, and morally; those, namely, who live as wretchedly, but were\nnot born to this condition.  These he represents as better in their\nfamily life, but smugglers and poachers who get into frequent bloody\nconflicts with the gamekeepers and revenue officers of the coast, become\nmore embittered against society during the prison life which they often\nundergo, and so stand abreast of the first class in their hatred of the\nproperty-holders.  \"And,\" he says, in closing, \"this whole class is\ncalled, by courtesy, the bold peasantry of England.\"\n\nDown to the present time, this description applies to the greater portion\nof the agricultural labourers of England.  In June, 1844, the _Times_\nsent a correspondent into the agricultural districts to report upon the\ncondition of this class, and the report which he furnished agreed wholly\nwith the foregoing.  In certain districts wages were not more than six\nshillings a week; not more, that is, that in many districts in Germany,\nwhile the prices of all the necessaries of life are at least twice as\nhigh.  What sort of life these people lead may be imagined; their food\nscanty and bad, their clothing ragged, their dwellings cramped and\ndesolate, small, wretched huts, with no comforts whatsoever; and, for\nyoung people, lodging-houses, where men and women are scarcely separated,\nand illegitimate intercourse thus provoked.  One or two days without work\nin the course of a month must inevitably plunge such people into the\ndirest want.  Moreover, they cannot combine to raise wages, because they\nare scattered, and if one alone refuses to work for low wages, there are\ndozens out of work, or supported by the rates, who are thankful for the\nmost trifling offer, while to him who declines work, every other form of\nrelief than the hated workhouse is refused by the Poor Law guardians as\nto a lazy vagabond; for the guardians are the very farmers from whom or\nfrom whose neighbours and acquaintances alone he can get work.  And not\nfrom one or two special districts of England do such reports come.  On\nthe contrary, the distress is general, equally great in the North and\nSouth, the East and West.  The condition of the labourers in Suffolk and\nNorfolk corresponds with that of Devonshire, Hampshire, and Sussex.  Wages\nare as low in Dorsetshire and Oxfordshire as in Kent and Surrey,\nBuckinghamshire and Cambridgeshire.\n\nOne especially barbaric cruelty against the working-class is embodied in\nthe Game Laws, which are more stringent than in any other country, while\nthe game is plentiful beyond all conception.  The English peasant who,\naccording to the old English custom and tradition, sees in poaching only\na natural and noble expression of courage and daring, is stimulated still\nfurther by the contrast between his own poverty and the _car tel est\nnotre plaisir_ of the lord, who preserves thousands of hares and game\nbirds for his private enjoyment.  The labourer lays snares, or shoots\nhere and there a piece of game.  It does not injure the landlord as a\nmatter of fact, for he has a vast superfluity, and it brings the poacher\na meal for himself and his starving family.  But if he is caught he goes\nto jail, and for a second offence receives at the least seven years'\ntransportation.  From the severity of these laws arise the frequent\nbloody conflicts with the gamekeepers, which lead to a number of murders\nevery year Hence the post of gamekeeper is not only dangerous, but of ill-\nrepute and despised.  Last year, in two cases, gamekeepers shot\nthemselves rather than continue their work.  Such is the moderate price\nat which the landed aristocracy purchases the noble sport of shooting;\nbut what does it matter to the lords of the soil?  Whether one or two\nmore or less of the \"surplus\" live or die matters nothing, and even if in\nconsequence of the Game Laws half the surplus population could be put out\nof the way, it would be all the better for the other half--according to\nthe philanthropy of the English landlords.\n\nAlthough the conditions of life in the country, the isolated dwellings,\nthe stability of the surroundings and occupations, and consequently of\nthe thoughts, are decidedly unfavourable to all development, yet poverty\nand want bear their fruits even here.  The manufacturing and mining\nproletariat emerged early from the first stage of resistance to our\nsocial order, the direct rebellion of the individual by the perpetration\nof crime; but the peasants are still in this stage at the present time.\nTheir favourite method of social warfare is incendiarism.  In the winter\nwhich followed the Revolution of July, in 1830-31, these incendiarisms\nfirst became general.  Disturbances had taken place, and the whole region\nof Sussex and the adjacent counties has been brought into a state of\nexcitement in October, in consequence of an increase of the coastguard\n(which made smuggling much more difficult and \"ruined the coast\"--in the\nwords of a farmer), changes in the Poor Law, low wages, and the\nintroduction of machinery.  In the winter the farmers' hay and\ncorn-stacks were burnt in the fields, and the very barns and stables\nunder their windows.  Nearly every night a couple of such fires blazed\nup, and spread terror among the farmers and landlords.  The offenders\nwere rarely discovered, and the workers attributed the incendiarism to a\nmythical person whom they named \"Swing.\"  Men puzzled their brains to\ndiscover who this Swing could be and whence this rage among the poor of\nthe country districts.  Of the great motive power, Want, Oppression, only\na single person here and there thought, and certainly no one in the\nagricultural districts.  Since that year the incendiarisms have been\nrepeated every winter, with each recurring unemployed season of the\nagricultural labourers.  In the winter of 1843-44, they were once more\nextraordinarily frequent.  There lies before me a series of numbers of\nthe _Northern Star_ of that time, each one of which contains a report of\nseveral incendiarisms, stating in each case its authority.  The numbers\nwanting in the following list I have not at hand; but they, too,\ndoubtless contain a number of cases.  Moreover, such a sheet cannot\npossibly ascertain all the cases which occur.  November 25th, 1843, two\ncases; several earlier ones are discussed.  December 16th, in\nBedfordshire, general excitement for a fortnight past in consequence of\nfrequent incendiarisms, of which several take place every night.  Two\ngreat farmhouses burnt down within the last few days; in Cambridgeshire\nfour great farmhouses, Hertfordshire one, and besides these, fifteen\nother incendiarisms in different districts.  December 30th, in Norfolk\none, Suffolk two, Essex two, Cheshire one, Lancashire one, Derby,\nLincoln, and the South twelve.  January 6th, 1844, in all ten.  January\n13th, seven.  January 20th, four incendiarisms.  From this time forward,\nthree or four incendiarisms per week are reported, and not as formerly\nuntil the spring only, but far into July and August.  And that crimes of\nthis sort are expected to increase in the approaching hard season of 1844-\n45, the English papers already indicate.\n\nWhat do my readers think of such a state of things in the quiet, idyllic\ncountry districts of England?  Is this social war, or is it not?  Is it a\nnatural state of things which can last?  Yet here the landlords and\nfarmers are as dull and stupefied, as blind to everything which does not\ndirectly put money into their pockets, as the manufacturers and the\nbourgeoisie in general in the manufacturing districts.  If the latter\npromise their employees salvation through the repeal of the Corn Laws,\nthe landlords and a great part of the farmers promise theirs Heaven upon\nearth from the maintenance of the same laws.  But in neither case do the\nproperty-holders succeed in winning the workers to the support of their\npet hobby.  Like the operatives, the agricultural labourers are\nthoroughly indifferent to the repeal or non-repeal of the Corn Laws.  Yet\nthe question is an important one for both.  That is to say--by the repeal\nof the Corn Laws, free competition, the present social economy is carried\nto its extreme point; all further development within the present order\ncomes to an end, and the only possible step farther is a radical\ntransformation of the social order. {268}  For the agricultural labourers\nthe question has, further, the following important bearing: Free\nimportation of corn involves (how, I cannot explain _here_) the\nemancipation of the farmers from the landlords, their transformation into\nLiberals.  Towards this consummation the Anti-Corn Law League has already\nlargely contributed, and this is its only real service.  When the farmers\nbecome Liberals, _i.e_., conscious bourgeois, the agricultural labourers\nwill inevitably become Chartists and Socialists; the first change\ninvolves the second.  And that a new movement is already beginning among\nthe agricultural labourers is proved by a meeting which Earl Radnor, a\nLiberal landlord, caused to be held in October, 1844, near Highworth,\nwhere his estates lie, to pass resolutions against the Corn Laws.  At\nthis meeting, the labourers, perfectly indifferent as to these laws,\ndemanded something wholly different, namely small holdings, at low rent,\nfor themselves, telling Earl Radnor all sorts of bitter truths to his\nface.  Thus the movement of the working-class is finding its way into the\nremote, stationary, mentally dead agricultural districts; and, thanks to\nthe general distress, will soon be as firmly rooted and energetic as in\nthe manufacturing districts. {269}  As to the religious state of the\nagricultural labourers, they are, it is true, more pious than the\nmanufacturing operatives; but they, too, are greatly at odds with the\nChurch--for in these districts members of the Established Church almost\nexclusively are to be found.  A correspondent of the _Morning Chronicle_,\nwho, over the signature, \"One who has whistled at the plough,\" reports\nhis tour through the agricultural districts, relates, among other things,\nthe following conversation with some labourers after service: \"I asked\none of these people whether the preacher of the day was their own\nclergyman.  \"Yes, blast him!  He is our own parson, and begs the whole\ntime.  He's been always a-begging as long as I've known him.\"  (The\nsermon had been upon a mission to the heathen.)  \"And as long as I've\nknown him too,\" added another; \"and I never knew a parson but what was\nbegging for this or the other.\"  \"Yes,\" said a woman, who had just come\nout of the church, \"and look how wages are going down, and see the rich\nvagabonds with whom the parsons eat and drink and hunt.  So help me God,\nwe are more fit to starve in the workhouse than pay the parsons as go\namong the heathen.\"  \"And why,\" said another, \"don't they send the\nparsons as drones every day in Salisbury Cathedral, for nobody but the\nbare stones?  Why don't _they_ go among the heathen?\"  \"They don't go,\"\nsaid the old man whom I had first asked, \"because they are rich, they\nhave all the land they need, they want the money in order to get rid of\nthe poor parsons.  I know what they want.  I know them too long for\nthat.\"  \"But, good friends,\" I asked, \"you surely do not always come out\nof the church with such bitter feelings towards the preacher?  Why do you\ngo at all?\"  \"What for do we go?\" said the woman.  \"We must, if we do not\nwant to lose everything, work and all, we must.\"  I learned later that\nthey had certain little privileges of fire-wood and potato land (which\nthey paid for!) on condition of going to church.\"  After describing their\npoverty and ignorance, the correspondent closes by saying: \"And now I\nboldly assert that the condition of these people, their poverty, their\nhatred of the church, their external submission and inward bitterness\nagainst the ecclesiastical dignitaries, is the rule among the country\nparishes of England, and its opposite is the exception.\"\n\nIf the peasantry of England shows the consequences which a numerous\nagricultural proletariat in connection with large farming involves for\nthe country districts, Wales illustrates the ruin of the small holders.\nIf the English country parishes reproduce the antagonism between\ncapitalist and proletarian, the state of the Welsh peasantry corresponds\nto the progressive ruin of the small bourgeoisie in the towns.  In Wales\nare to be found, almost exclusively, small holders, who cannot with like\nprofit sell their products as cheaply as the larger, more favourably\nsituated English farmers, with whom, however, they are obliged to\ncompete.  Moreover, in some places the quality of the land admits of the\nraising of live stock only, which is but slightly profitable.  Then, too,\nthese Welsh farmers, by reason of their separate nationality, which they\nretain pertinaciously, are much more stationary than the English farmers.\nBut the competition among themselves and with their English neighbours\n(and the increased mortgages upon their land consequent upon this) has\nreduced them to such a state that they can scarcely live at all; and\nbecause they have not recognised the true cause of their wretched\ncondition, they attribute it to all sorts of small causes, such as high\ntolls, etc, which do check the development of agriculture and commerce,\nbut are taken into account as standing charges by every one who takes a\nholding, and are therefore really ultimately paid by the landlord.  Here,\ntoo, the new Poor Law is cordially hated by the tenants, who hover in\nperpetual danger of coming under its sway.  In 1843, the famous \"Rebecca\"\ndisturbances broke out among the Welsh peasantry; the men dressed in\nwomen's clothing, blackened their faces, and fell in armed crowds upon\nthe toll-gates, destroyed them amidst great rejoicing and firing of guns,\ndemolished the toll-keepers' houses, wrote threatening letters in the\nname of the imaginary \"Rebecca,\" and once went so far as to storm the\nworkhouse of Carmarthen.  Later, when the militia was called out and the\npolice strengthened, the peasants drew them off with wonderful skill upon\nfalse scents, demolished toll-gates at one point while the militia, lured\nby false signal bugles, was marching in some opposite direction; and\nbetook themselves finally, when the police was too thoroughly reinforced,\nto single incendiarisms and attempts at murder.  As usual, these greater\ncrimes were the end of the movement.  Many withdrew from disapproval,\nothers from fear, and peace was restored of itself.  The Government\nappointed a commission to investigate the affair and its causes, and\nthere was an end of the matter.  The poverty of the peasantry continues,\nhowever, and will one day, since it cannot under existing circumstances\ngrow less, but must go on intensifying, produce more serious\nmanifestations than these humorous Rebecca masquerades.\n\nIf England illustrates the results of the system of farming on a large\nscale and Wales on a small one, Ireland exhibits the consequences of\noverdividing the soil.  The great mass of the population of Ireland\nconsists of small tenants who occupy a sorry hut without partitions, and\na potato patch just large enough to supply them most scantily with\npotatoes through the winter.  In consequence of the great competition\nwhich prevails among these small tenants, the rent has reached an unheard-\nof height, double, treble, and quadruple that paid in England.  For every\nagricultural labourer seeks to become a tenant-farmer, and though the\ndivision of land has gone so far, there still remain numbers of labourers\nin competition for plots.  Although in Great Britain 32,000,000 acres of\nland are cultivated, and in Ireland but 14,000,000; although Great\nBritain produces agricultural products to the value of 150,000,000\npounds, and Ireland of but 36,000,000 pounds, there are in Ireland 75,000\nagricultural proletarians _more_ than in the neighbouring island. {272a}\nHow great the competition for land in Ireland must be is evident from\nthis extraordinary disproportion, especially when one reflects that the\nlabourers in Great Britain are living in the utmost distress.  The\nconsequence of this competition is that it is impossible for the tenants\nto live much better than the labourers, by reason of the high rents paid.\nThe Irish people is thus held in crushing poverty, from which it cannot\nfree itself under our present social conditions.  These people live in\nthe most wretched clay huts, scarcely good enough for cattle-pens, have\nscant food all winter long, or, as the report above quoted expresses it,\nthey have potatoes half enough thirty weeks in the year, and the rest of\nthe year nothing.  When the time comes in the spring at which this\nprovision reaches its end, or can no longer be used because of its\nsprouting, wife and children go forth to beg and tramp the country with\ntheir kettle in their hands.  Meanwhile the husband, after planting\npotatoes for the next year, goes in search of work either in Ireland or\nEngland, and returns at the potato harvest to his family.  This is the\ncondition in which nine-tenths of the Irish country folks live.  They are\npoor as church mice, wear the most wretched rags, and stand upon the\nlowest plane of intelligence possible in a half-civilised country.\nAccording to the report quoted, there are, in a population of 8.5\nmillions, 585,000 heads of families in a state of total destitution; and\naccording to other authorities, cited by Sheriff Alison, {272b} there are\nin Ireland 2,300,000 persons who could not live without public or private\nassistance--or 27 per cent. of the whole population paupers!\n\nThe cause of this poverty lies in the existing social conditions,\nespecially in competition here found in the form of the subdivision of\nthe soil.  Much effort has been spent in finding other causes.  It has\nbeen asserted that the relation of the tenant to the landlord who lets\nhis estate in large lots to tenants, who again have their sub-tenants,\nand sub-sub-tenants, in turn, so that often ten middlemen come between\nthe landlord and the actual cultivator--it has been asserted that the\nshameful law which gives the landlord the right of expropriating the\ncultivator who may have paid his rent duly, if the first tenant fails to\npay the landlord, that this law is to blame for all this poverty.  But\nall this determines only the form in which the poverty manifests itself.\nMake the small tenant a landowner himself and what follows?  The majority\ncould not live upon their holdings even if they had no rent to pay, and\nany slight improvement which might take place would be lost again in a\nfew years in consequence of the rapid increase of population.  The\nchildren would then live to grow up under the improved conditions who now\ndie in consequence of poverty in early childhood.  From another side\ncomes the assertion that the shameless oppression inflicted by the\nEnglish is the cause of the trouble.  It is the cause of the somewhat\nearlier appearance of this poverty, but not of the poverty itself.  Or\nthe blame is laid on the Protestant Church forced upon a Catholic nation;\nbut divide among the Irish what the Church takes from them, and it does\nnot reach six shillings a head.  Besides, tithes are a tax upon landed\nproperty, not upon the tenant, though he may nominally pay them; now,\nsince the Commutation Bill of 1838, the landlord pays the tithes directly\nand reckons so much higher rent, so that the tenant is none the better\noff.  And in the same way a hundred other causes of this poverty are\nbrought forward, all proving as little as these.  This poverty is the\nresult of our social conditions; apart from these, causes may be found\nfor the manner in which it manifests itself, but not for the fact of its\nexistence.  That poverty manifests itself in Ireland thus and not\notherwise, is owing to the character of the people, and to their\nhistorical development.  The Irish are a people related in their whole\ncharacter to the Latin nations, to the French, and especially to the\nItalians.  The bad features of their character we have already had\ndepicted by Carlyle.  Let us now hear an Irishman, who at least comes\nnearer to the truth than Carlyle, with his prejudice in favour of the\nTeutonic character: {273}\n\n   \"They are restless, yet indolent, clever and indiscreet, stormy,\n   impatient, and improvident; brave by instinct, generous without much\n   reflection, quick to revenge and forgive insults, to make and to\n   renounce friendships, gifted with genius prodigally, sparingly with\n   judgment.\"\n\nWith the Irish, feeling and passion predominate; reason must bow before\nthem.  Their sensuous, excitable nature prevents reflection and quiet,\npersevering activity from reaching development--such a nation is utterly\nunfit for manufacture as now conducted.  Hence they held fast to\nagriculture, and remained upon the lowest plane even of that.  With the\nsmall subdivisions of land, which were not here artificially created, as\nin France and on the Rhine, by the division of great estates, but have\nexisted from time immemorial, an improvement of the soil by the\ninvestment of capital was not to be thought of; and it would, according\nto Alison, require 120 million pounds sterling to bring the soil up to\nthe not very high state of fertility already attained in England.  The\nEnglish immigration, which might have raised the standard of Irish\ncivilisation, has contented itself with the most brutal plundering of the\nIrish people; and while the Irish, by their immigration into England,\nhave furnished England a leaven which will produce its own results in the\nfuture, they have little for which to be thankful to the English\nimmigration.\n\nThe attempts of the Irish to save themselves from their present ruin, on\nthe one hand, take the form of crimes.  These are the order of the day in\nthe agricultural districts, and are nearly always directed against the\nmost immediate enemies, the landlord's agents, or their obedient\nservants, the Protestant intruders, whose large farms are made up of the\npotato patches of hundreds of ejected families.  Such crimes are\nespecially frequent in the South and West.  On the other hand, the Irish\nhope for relief by means of the agitation for the repeal of the\nLegislative Union with England.  From all the foregoing, it is clear that\nthe uneducated Irish must see in the English their worst enemies; and\ntheir first hope of improvement in the conquest of national independence.\nBut quite as clear is it, too, that Irish distress cannot be removed by\nany Act of Repeal.  Such an Act would, however, at once lay bare the fact\nthat the cause of Irish misery, which now seems to come from abroad, is\nreally to be found at home.  Meanwhile, it is an open question whether\nthe accomplishment of repeal will be necessary to make this clear to the\nIrish.  Hitherto, neither Chartism nor Socialism has had marked success\nin Ireland.\n\nI close my observations upon Ireland at this point the more readily, as\nthe Repeal Agitation of 1843 and O'Connell's trial have been the means of\nmaking the Irish distress more and more known in Germany.\n\nWe have now followed the proletariat of the British Islands through all\nbranches of its activity, and found it everywhere living in want and\nmisery under totally inhuman conditions.  We have seen discontent arise\nwith the rise of the proletariat, grow, develop, and organise; we have\nseen open bloodless and bloody battles of the proletariat against the\nbourgeoisie.  We have investigated the principles according to which the\nfate, the hopes, and fears of the proletariat are determined, and we have\nfound that there is no prospect of improvement in their condition.\n\nWe have had an opportunity, here and there, of observing the conduct of\nthe bourgeoisie towards the proletariat, and we have found that it\nconsiders only itself, has only its own advantage in view.  However, in\norder not to be unjust, let us investigate its mode of action somewhat\nmore exactly.\n\n\n\n\nTHE ATTITUDE OF THE BOURGEOISIE TOWARDS THE PROLETARIAT.\n\n\nIn speaking of the bourgeoisie I include the so-called aristocracy, for\nthis is a privileged class, an aristocracy, only in contrast with the\nbourgeoisie, not in contrast with the proletariat.  The proletarian sees\nin both only the property-holder--_i.e_., the bourgeois.  Before the\nprivilege of property all other privileges vanish.  The sole difference\nis this, that the bourgeois proper stands in active relations with the\nmanufacturing, and, in a measure, with the mining proletarians, and, as\nfarmer, with the agricultural labourers, whereas the so-called aristocrat\ncomes into contact with the agricultural labourer only.\n\nI have never seen a class so deeply demoralised, so incurably debased by\nselfishness, so corroded within, so incapable of progress, as the English\nbourgeoisie; and I mean by this, especially the bourgeoisie proper,\nparticularly the Liberal, Corn Law repealing bourgeoisie.  For it nothing\nexists in this world, except for the sake of money, itself not excluded.\nIt knows no bliss save that of rapid gain, no pain save that of losing\ngold. {276}  In the presence of this avarice and lust of gain, it is not\npossible for a single human sentiment or opinion to remain untainted.\nTrue, these English bourgeois are good husbands and family men, and have\nall sorts of other private virtues, and appear, in ordinary intercourse,\nas decent and respectable as all other bourgeois; even in business they\nare better to deal with than the Germans; they do not higgle and haggle\nso much as our own pettifogging merchants; but how does this help\nmatters?  Ultimately it is self-interest, and especially money gain,\nwhich alone determines them.  I once went into Manchester with such a\nbourgeois, and spoke to him of the bad, unwholesome method of building,\nthe frightful condition of the working-people's quarters, and asserted\nthat I had never seen so ill-built a city.  The man listened quietly to\nthe end, and said at the corner where we parted: \"And yet there is a\ngreat deal of money made here; good morning, sir.\"  It is utterly\nindifferent to the English bourgeois whether his working-men starve or\nnot, if only he makes money.  All the conditions of life are measured by\nmoney, and what brings no money is nonsense, unpractical, idealistic\nbosh.  Hence, Political Economy, the Science of Wealth, is the favourite\nstudy of these bartering Jews.  Every one of them is a Political\nEconomist.  The relation of the manufacturer to his operatives has\nnothing human in it; it is purely economic.  The manufacturer is Capital,\nthe operative Labour.  And if the operative will not be forced into this\nabstraction, if he insists that he is not Labour, but a man, who\npossesses, among other things, the attribute of labour force, if he takes\nit into his head that he need not allow himself to be sold and bought in\nthe market, as the commodity \"Labour,\" the bourgeois reason comes to a\nstandstill.  He cannot comprehend that he holds any other relation to the\noperatives than that of purchase and sale; he sees in them not human\nbeings, but hands, as he constantly calls them to their faces; he\ninsists, as Carlyle says, that \"Cash Payment is the only nexus between\nman and man.\"  Even the relation between himself and his wife is, in\nninety-nine cases out of a hundred, mere \"Cash Payment.\"  Money\ndetermines the worth of the man; he is \"worth ten thousand pounds.\"  He\nwho has money is of \"the better sort of people,\" is \"influential,\" and\nwhat _he_ does counts for something in his social circle.  The\nhuckstering spirit penetrates the whole language, all relations are\nexpressed in business terms, in economic categories.  Supply and demand\nare the formulas according to which the logic of the English bourgeois\njudges all human life.  Hence free competition in every respect, hence\nthe _regime_ of _laissez-faire, laissez-aller_ in government, in\nmedicine, in education, and soon to be in religion, too, as the State\nChurch collapses more and more.  Free competition will suffer no\nlimitation, no State supervision; the whole State is but a burden to it.\nIt would reach its highest perfection in a _wholly_ ungoverned anarchic\nsociety, where each might exploit the other to his heart's content.\nSince, however, the bourgeoisie cannot dispense with government, but must\nhave it to hold the equally indispensable proletariat in check, it turns\nthe power of government against the proletariat and keeps out of its way\nas far as possible.\n\nLet no one believe, however, that the \"cultivated\" Englishman openly\nbrags with his egotism.  On the contrary, he conceals it under the vilest\nhypocrisy.  What?  The wealthy English fail to remember the poor?  They\nwho have founded philanthropic institutions, such as no other country can\nboast of!  Philanthropic institutions forsooth!  As though you rendered\nthe proletarians a service in first sucking out their very life-blood and\nthen practising your self-complacent, Pharisaic philanthropy upon them,\nplacing yourselves before the world as mighty benefactors of humanity\nwhen you give back to the plundered victims the hundredth part of what\nbelongs to them!  Charity which degrades him who gives more than him who\ntakes; charity which treads the downtrodden still deeper in the dust,\nwhich demands that the degraded, the pariah cast out by society, shall\nfirst surrender the last that remains to him, his very claim to manhood,\nshall first beg for mercy before your mercy deigns to press, in the shape\nof an alms, the brand of degradation upon his brow.  But let us hear the\nEnglish bourgeoisie's own words.  It is not yet a year since I read in\nthe _Manchester Guardian_ the following letter to the editor, which was\npublished without comment as a perfectly natural, reasonable thing:\n\n   \"MR. EDITOR,--For some time past our main streets are haunted by\n   swarms of beggars, who try to awaken the pity of the passers-by in a\n   most shameless and annoying manner, by exposing their tattered\n   clothing, sickly aspect, and disgusting wounds and deformities.  I\n   should think that when one not only pays the poor-rate, but also\n   contributes largely to the charitable institutions, one had done\n   enough to earn a right to be spared such disagreeable and impertinent\n   molestations.  And why else do we pay such high rates for the\n   maintenance of the municipal police, if they do not even protect us so\n   far as to make it possible to go to or out of town in peace?  I hope\n   the publication of these lines in your widely-circulated paper may\n   induce the authorities to remove this nuisance; and I remain,--Your\n   obedient servant,\n\n   \"A LADY.\"\n\nThere you have it!  The English bourgeoisie is charitable out of self-\ninterest; it gives nothing outright, but regards its gifts as a business\nmatter, makes a bargain with the poor, saying: \"If I spend this much upon\nbenevolent institutions, I thereby purchase the right not to be troubled\nany further, and you are bound thereby to stay in your dusky holes and\nnot to irritate my tender nerves by exposing your misery.  You shall\ndespair as before, but you shall despair unseen, this I require, this I\npurchase with my subscription of twenty pounds for the infirmary!\"  It is\ninfamous, this charity of a Christian bourgeois!  And so writes \"A Lady;\"\nshe does well to sign herself such, well that she has lost the courage to\ncall herself a woman!  But if the \"Ladies\" are such as this, what must\nthe \"Gentlemen\" be?  It will be said that this is a single case; but no,\nthe foregoing letter expresses the temper of the great majority of the\nEnglish bourgeoisie, or the editor would not have accepted it, and some\nreply would have been made to it, which I watched for in vain in the\nsucceeding numbers.  And as to the efficiency of this philanthropy, Canon\nParkinson himself says that the poor are relieved much more by the poor\nthan by the bourgeoisie; and such relief given by an honest proletarian\nwho knows himself what it is to be hungry, for whom sharing his scanty\nmeal is really a sacrifice, but a sacrifice borne with pleasure, such\nhelp has a wholly different ring to it from the carelessly-tossed alms of\nthe luxurious bourgeois.\n\nIn other respects, too, the bourgeoisie assumes a hypocritical, boundless\nphilanthropy, but only when its own interests require it; as in its\nPolitics and Political Economy.  It has been at work now well on towards\nfive years to prove to the working-men that it strives to abolish the\nCorn Laws solely in their interest.  But the long and short of the matter\nis this: the Corn Laws keep the price of bread higher than in other\ncountries, and thus raise wages, but these high wages render difficult\ncompetition of the manufacturers against other nations in which bread,\nand consequently wages, are cheaper.  The Corn Laws being repealed, the\nprice of bread falls, and wages gradually approach those of other\nEuropean countries, as must be clear to every one from our previous\nexposition of the principles according to which wages are determined.  The\nmanufacturer can compete more readily, the demand for English goods\nincreases, and, with it, the demand for labour.  In consequence of this\nincreased demand wages would actually rise somewhat, and the unemployed\nworkers be re-employed; but for how long?  The \"surplus population\" of\nEngland, and especially of Ireland, is sufficient to supply English\nmanufacture with the necessary operatives, even if it were doubled; and,\nin a few years, the small advantage of the repeal of the Corn Laws would\nbe balanced, a new crisis would follow, and we should be back at the\npoint from which we started, while the first stimulus to manufacture\nwould have increased population meanwhile.  All this the proletarians\nunderstand very well, and have told the manufacturers to their faces;\nbut, in spite of that, the manufacturers have in view solely the\nimmediate advantage which the Corn Laws would bring them.  They are too\nnarrow-minded to see that, even for themselves, no permanent advantage\ncan arise from this measure, because their competition with each other\nwould soon force the profit of the individual back to its old level; and\nthus they continue to shriek to the working-men that it is purely for the\nsake of the starving millions that the rich members of the Liberal party\npour hundreds and thousands of pounds into the treasury of the Anti-Corn\nLaw League, while every one knows that they are only sending the butter\nafter the cheese, that they calculate upon earning it all back in the\nfirst ten years after the repeal of the Corn Laws.  But the workers are\nno longer to be misled by the bourgeoisie, especially since the\ninsurrection of 1842.  They demand of every one who presents himself as\ninterested in their welfare, that he should declare himself in favour of\nthe People's Charter as proof of the sincerity of his professions, and in\nso doing, they protest against all outside help, for the Charter is a\ndemand for the power to help themselves.  Whoever declines so to declare\nhimself they pronounce their enemy, and are perfectly right in so doing,\nwhether he be a declared foe or a false friend Besides, the Anti-Corn Law\nLeague has used the most despicable falsehoods and tricks to win the\nsupport of the workers.  It has tried to prove to them that the money\nprice of labour is in inverse proportion to the price of corn; that wages\nare high when grain is cheap, and _vice versa_, an assertion which it\npretends to prove with the most ridiculous arguments, and one which is,\nin itself, more ridiculous than any other that has proceeded from the\nmouth of an Economist.  When this failed to help matters, the workers\nwere promised bliss supreme in consequence of the increased demand in the\nlabour market; indeed, men went so far as to carry through the streets\ntwo models of loaves of bread, on one of which, by far the larger, was\nwritten: \"American Eightpenny Loaf, Wages Four Shillings per Day,\" and\nupon the much smaller one: \"English Eightpenny Loaf, Wages Two Shillings\na Day.\"  But the workers have not allowed themselves to be misled.  They\nknow their lords and masters too well.\n\nBut rightly to measure the hypocrisy of these promises, the practice of\nthe bourgeoisie must be taken into account.  We have seen in the course\nof our report how the bourgeoisie exploits the proletariat in every\nconceivable way for its own benefit!  We have, however, hitherto seen\nonly how the single bourgeois maltreats the proletariat upon his own\naccount.  Let us turn now to the manner in which the bourgeoisie as a\nparty, as the power of the State, conducts itself towards the\nproletariat.  Laws are necessary only because there are persons in\nexistence who own nothing; and although this is directly expressed in but\nfew laws, as, for instance, those against vagabonds and tramps, in which\nthe proletariat as such is outlawed, yet enmity to the proletariat is so\nemphatically the basis of the law that the judges, and especially the\nJustices of the Peace, who are bourgeois themselves, and with whom the\nproletariat comes most in contact, find this meaning in the laws without\nfurther consideration.  If a rich man is brought up, or rather summoned,\nto appear before the court, the judge regrets that he is obliged to\nimpose so much trouble, treats the matter as favourably as possible, and,\nif he is forced to condemn the accused, does so with extreme regret, etc.\netc., and the end of it all is a miserable fine, which the bourgeois\nthrows upon the table with contempt and then departs.  But if a poor\ndevil gets into such a position as involves appearing before the Justice\nof the Peace--he has almost always spent the night in the station-house\nwith a crowd of his peers--he is regarded from the beginning as guilty;\nhis defence is set aside with a contemptuous \"Oh! we know the excuse,\"\nand a fine imposed which he cannot pay and must work out with several\nmonths on the treadmill.  And if nothing can be proved against him, he is\nsent to the treadmill, none the less, \"as a rogue and a vagabond.\"  The\npartisanship of the Justices of the Peace, especially in the country,\nsurpasses all description, and it is so much the order of the day that\nall cases which are not too utterly flagrant are quietly reported by the\nnewspapers, without comment.  Nor is anything else to be expected.  For\non the one hand, these Dogberries do merely construe the law according to\nthe intent of the farmers, and, on the other, they are themselves\nbourgeois, who see the foundation of all true order in the interests of\ntheir class.  And the conduct of the police corresponds to that of the\nJustices of the Peace.  The bourgeois may do what he will and the police\nremain ever polite, adhering strictly to the law, but the proletarian is\nroughly, brutally treated; his poverty both casts the suspicion of every\nsort of crime upon him and cuts him off from legal redress against any\ncaprice of the administrators of the law; for him, therefore, the\nprotecting forms of the law do not exist, the police force their way into\nhis house without further ceremony, arrest and abuse him; and only when a\nworking-men's association, such as the miners, engages a Roberts, does it\nbecome evident how little the protective side of the law exists for the\nworking-men, how frequently he has to bear all the burdens of the law\nwithout enjoying its benefits.\n\nDown to the present hour, the property-holding class in Parliament still\nstruggles against the better feelings of those not yet fallen a prey to\negotism, and seeks to subjugate the proletariat still further.  One piece\nof common land after another is appropriated and placed under\ncultivation, a process by which the general cultivation is furthered, but\nthe proletariat greatly injured.  Where there were still commons, the\npoor could pasture an ass, a pig, or geese, the children and young people\nhad a place where they could play and live out of doors; but this is\ngradually coming to an end.  The earnings of the worker are less, and the\nyoung people, deprived of their playground, go to the beer-shops.  A mass\nof acts for enclosing and cultivating commons is passed at every session\nof Parliament.  When the Government determined during the session of 1844\nto force the all monopolising railways to make travelling possible for\nthe workers by means of charges proportionate to their means, a penny a\nmile, and proposed therefore to introduce such a third class train upon\nevery railway daily, the \"Reverend Father in God,\" the Bishop of London,\nproposed that Sunday, the only day upon which working-men in work _can_\ntravel, be exempted from this rule, and travelling thus be left open to\nthe rich and shut off from the poor.  This proposition was, however, too\ndirect, too undisguised to pass through Parliament, and was dropped.  I\nhave no room to enumerate the many concealed attacks of even one single\nsession upon the proletariat.  One from the session of 1844 must suffice.\nAn obscure member of Parliament, a Mr. Miles, proposed a bill regulating\nthe relation of master and servant which seemed comparatively\nunobjectionable.  The Government became interested in the bill, and it\nwas referred to a committee.  Meanwhile the strike among the miners in\nthe North broke out, and Roberts made his triumphal passage through\nEngland with his acquitted working-men.  When the bill was reported by\nthe committee, it was discovered that certain most despotic provisions\nhad been interpolated in it, especially one conferring upon the employer\nthe power to bring before any Justice of the Peace every working-man who\nhad contracted verbally or in writing to do any work whatsoever, in case\nof refusal to work or other misbehaviour, and have him condemned to\nprison with hard labour for two months, upon the oath of the employer or\nhis agent or overlooker, _i.e_., upon the oath of the accuser.  This bill\naroused the working-men to the utmost fury, the more so as the Ten Hours'\nBill was before Parliament at the same time, and had called forth a\nconsiderable agitation.  Hundreds of meetings were held, hundreds of\nworking-men's petitions forwarded to London to Thomas Duncombe, the\nrepresentative of the interests of the proletariat.  This man was, except\nFerrand, the representative of \"Young England,\" the only vigorous\nopponent of the bill; but when the other Radicals saw that the people\nwere declaring against it, one after the other crept forward and took his\nplace by Duncombe's side; and as the Liberal bourgeoisie had not the\ncourage to defend the bill in the face of the excitement among the\nworking-men, it was ignominiously lost.\n\nMeanwhile the most open declaration of war of the bourgeoisie upon the\nproletariat is Malthus' Law of Population and the New Poor Law framed in\naccordance with it.  We have already alluded several times to the theory\nof Malthus.  We may sum up its final result in these few words, that the\nearth is perennially over-populated, whence poverty, misery, distress,\nand immorality must prevail; that it is the lot, the eternal destiny of\nmankind, to exist in too great numbers, and therefore in diverse classes,\nof which some are rich, educated, and moral, and others more or less\npoor, distressed, ignorant, and immoral.  Hence it follows in practice,\nand Malthus himself drew this conclusion, that charities and poor-rates\nare, properly speaking, nonsense, since they serve only to maintain, and\nstimulate the increase of, the surplus population whose competition\ncrushes down wages for the employed; that the employment of the poor by\nthe Poor Law Guardians is equally unreasonable, since only a fixed\nquantity of the products of labour can be consumed, and for every\nunemployed labourer thus furnished employment, another hitherto employed\nmust be driven into enforced idleness, whence private undertakings suffer\nat cost of Poor Law industry; that, in other words, the whole problem is\nnot how to support the surplus population, but how to restrain it as far\nas possible.  Malthus declares in plain English that the right to live, a\nright previously asserted in favour of every man in the world, is\nnonsense.  He quotes the words of a poet, that the poor man comes to the\nfeast of Nature and finds no cover laid for him, and adds that \"she bids\nhim begone,\" for he did not before his birth ask of society whether or\nnot he is welcome.  This is now the pet theory of all genuine English\nbourgeois, and very naturally, since it is the most specious excuse for\nthem, and has, moreover, a good deal of truth in it under existing\nconditions.  If, then, the problem is not to make the \"surplus\npopulation\" useful, to transform it into available population, but merely\nto let it starve to death in the least objectionable way and to prevent\nits having too many children, this, of course, is simple enough, provided\nthe surplus population perceives its own superfluousness and takes kindly\nto starvation.  There is, however, in spite of the violent exertions of\nthe humane bourgeoisie, no immediate prospect of its succeeding in\nbringing about such a disposition among the workers.  The workers have\ntaken it into their heads that they, with their busy hands, are the\nnecessary, and the rich capitalists, who do nothing, the surplus\npopulation.\n\nSince, however, the rich hold all the power, the proletarians must\nsubmit, if they will not good-temperedly perceive it for themselves, to\nhave the law actually declare them superfluous.  This has been done by\nthe New Poor Law.  The Old Poor Law which rested upon the Act of 1601\n(the 43rd of Elizabeth), naively started from the notion that it is the\nduty of the parish to provide for the maintenance of the poor.  Whoever\nhad no work received relief, and the poor man regarded the parish as\npledged to protect him from starvation.  He demanded his weekly relief as\nhis right, not as a favour, and this became, at last, too much for the\nbourgeoisie.  In 1833, when the bourgeoisie had just come into power\nthrough the Reform Bill, and pauperism in the country districts had just\nreached its full development, the bourgeoisie began the reform of the\nPoor Law according to its own point of view.  A commission was appointed,\nwhich investigated the administration of the Poor Laws, and revealed a\nmultitude of abuses.  It was discovered that the whole working-class in\nthe country was pauperised and more or less dependent upon the rates,\nfrom which they received relief when wages were low; it was found that\nthis system by which the unemployed were maintained, the ill-paid and the\nparents of large families relieved, fathers of illegitimate children\nrequired to pay alimony, and poverty, in general, recognised as needing\nprotection, it was found that this system was ruining the nation, was--\n\n   \"A check upon industry, a reward for improvident marriage, a stimulus\n   to increased population, and a means of counterbalancing the effect of\n   an increased population upon wages; a national provision for\n   discouraging the honest and industrious, and protecting the lazy,\n   vicious, and improvident; calculated to destroy the bonds of family\n   life, hinder systematically the accumulation of capital, scatter that\n   which is already accumulated, and ruin the taxpayers.  Moreover, in\n   the provision of aliment, it sets a premium upon illegitimate\n   children.\"\n\n(Words of the Report of the Poor Law Commissioners.) {286}  This\ndescription of the action of the Old Poor Law is certainly correct;\nrelief fosters laziness and increase of \"surplus population.\"  Under\npresent social conditions it is perfectly clear that the poor man is\ncompelled to be an egotist, and when he can choose, living equally well\nin either case, he prefers doing nothing to working.  But what follows\ntherefrom?  That our present social conditions are good for nothing, and\nnot as the Malthusian Commissioners conclude, that poverty is a crime,\nand, as such, to be visited with heinous penalties which may serve as a\nwarning to others.\n\nBut these wise Malthusians were so thoroughly convinced of the\ninfallibility of their theory that they did not for one moment hesitate\nto cast the poor into the Procrustean bed of their economic notions and\ntreat them with the most revolting cruelty.  Convinced with Malthus and\nthe rest of the adherents of free competition that it is best to let each\none take care of himself, they would have preferred to abolish the Poor\nLaws altogether.  Since, however, they had neither the courage nor the\nauthority to do this, they proposed a Poor Law constructed as far as\npossible in harmony with the doctrine of Malthus, which is yet more\nbarbarous than that of _laissez-faire_, because it interferes actively in\ncases in which the latter is passive.  We have seen how Malthus\ncharacterises poverty, or rather the want of employment, as a crime under\nthe title \"superfluity,\" and recommends for it punishment by starvation.\nThe commissioners were not quite so barbarous; death outright by\nstarvation was something too terrible even for a Poor Law Commissioner.\n\"Good,\" said they, \"we grant you poor a right to exist, but only to\nexist; the right to multiply you have not, nor the right to exist as\nbefits human beings.  You are a pest, and if we cannot get rid of you as\nwe do of other pests, you shall feel, at least, that you are a pest, and\nyou shall at least be held in check, kept from bringing into the world\nother \"surplus,\" either directly or through inducing in others laziness\nand want of employment.  Live you shall, but live as an awful warning to\nall those who might have inducements to become \"superfluous.\"\n\nThey accordingly brought in the New Poor Law, which was passed by\nParliament in 1834, and continues in force down to the present day.  All\nrelief in money and provisions was abolished; the only relief allowed was\nadmission to the workhouses immediately built.  The regulations for these\nworkhouses, or, as the people call them, Poor Law Bastilles, is such as\nto frighten away every one who has the slightest prospect of life without\nthis form of public charity.  To make sure that relief be applied for\nonly in the most extreme cases and after every other effort had failed,\nthe workhouse has been made the most repulsive residence which the\nrefined ingenuity of a Malthusian can invent.  The food is worse than\nthat of the most ill-paid working-man while employed, and the work\nharder, or they might prefer the workhouse to their wretched existence\noutside.  Meat, especially fresh meat, is rarely furnished, chiefly\npotatoes, the worst possible bread and oatmeal porridge, little or no\nbeer.  The food of criminal prisoners is better, as a rule, so that the\npaupers frequently commit some offence for the purpose of getting into\njail.  For the workhouse is a jail too; he who does not finish his task\ngets nothing to eat; he who wishes to go out must ask permission, which\nis granted or not, according to his behaviour or the inspector's whim,\ntobacco is forbidden, also the receipt of gifts from relatives or friends\noutside the house; the paupers wear a workhouse uniform, and are handed\nover, helpless and without redress, to the caprice of the inspectors.  To\nprevent their labour from competing with that of outside concerns, they\nare set to rather useless tasks: the men break stones, \"as much as a\nstrong man can accomplish with effort in a day;\" the women, children, and\naged men pick oakum, for I know not what insignificant use.  To prevent\nthe \"superfluous\" from multiplying, and \"demoralised\" parents from\ninfluencing their children, families are broken up, the husband is placed\nin one wing, the wife in another, the children in a third, and they are\npermitted to see one another only at stated times after long intervals,\nand then only when they have, in the opinion of the officials, behaved\nwell.  And in order to shut off the external world from contamination by\npauperism within these bastilles, the inmates are permitted to receive\nvisits only with the consent of the officials, and in the\nreception-rooms; to communicate in general with the world outside only by\nleave and under supervision.\n\nYet the food is supposed to be wholesome and the treatment humane with\nall this.  But the intent of the law is too loudly outspoken for this\nrequirement to be in any wise fulfilled.  The Poor Law Commissioners and\nthe whole English bourgeoisie deceive themselves if they believe the\nadministration of the law possible without these results.  The treatment,\nwhich the letter of the law prescribes, is in direct contradiction of its\nspirit.  If the law in its essence proclaims the poor criminals, the\nworkhouses prisons, their inmates beyond the pale of the law, beyond the\npale of humanity, objects of disgust and repulsion, then all commands to\nthe contrary are unavailing.  In practice, the spirit and not the letter\nof the law is followed in the treatment of the poor, as in the following\nfew examples:\n\n\"In the workhouse at Greenwich, in the summer of 1843, a boy five years\nold was punished by being shut into the dead-room, where he had to sleep\nupon the lids of the coffins.  In the workhouse at Herne, the same\npunishment was inflicted upon a little girl for wetting the bed at night,\nand this method of punishment seems to be a favourite one.  This\nworkhouse, which stands in one of the most beautiful regions of Kent, is\npeculiar, in so far as its windows open only upon the court, and but two,\nnewly introduced, afford the inmates a glimpse of the outer world.  The\nauthor who relates this in the _Illuminated Magazine_, closes his\ndescription with the words: \"If God punished men for crimes as man\npunishes man for poverty, then woe to the sons of Adam!\"\n\nIn November, 1843, a man died at Leicester, who had been dismissed two\ndays before from the workhouse at Coventry.  The details of the treatment\nof the poor in this institution are revolting.  The man, George Robson,\nhad a wound upon the shoulder, the treatment of which was wholly\nneglected; he was set to work at the pump, using the sound arm; was given\nonly the usual workhouse fare, which he was utterly unable to digest by\nreason of the unhealed wound and his general debility; he naturally grew\nweaker, and the more he complained, the more brutally he was treated.\nWhen his wife tried to bring him her drop of beer, she was reprimanded,\nand forced to drink it herself in the presence of the female warder.  He\nbecame ill, but received no better treatment.  Finally, at his own\nrequest, and under the most insulting epithets, he was discharged,\naccompanied by his wife.  Two days later he died at Leicester, in\nconsequence of the neglected wound and of the food given him, which was\nutterly indigestible for one in his condition, as the surgeon present at\nthe inquest testified.  When he was discharged, there were handed to him\nletters containing money, which had been kept back six weeks, and opened,\naccording to a rule of the establishment, by the inspector!  In\nBirmingham such scandalous occurrences took place, that finally, in 1843,\nan official was sent to investigate the case.  He found that four tramps\nhad been shut up naked under a staircase in a black hole, eight to ten\ndays, often deprived of food until noon, and that at the severest season\nof the year.  A little boy had been passed through all grades of\npunishment known to the institution; first locked up in a damp, vaulted,\nnarrow, lumber-room; then in the dog-hole twice, the second time three\ndays and three nights; then the same length of time in the old dog-hole,\nwhich was still worse; then the tramp-room, a stinking, disgustingly\nfilthy hole, with wooden sleeping stalls, where the official, in the\ncourse of his inspection, found two other tattered boys, shrivelled with\ncold, who had been spending three days there.  In the dog-hole there were\noften seven, and in the tramp-room, twenty men huddled together.  Women,\nalso, were placed in the dog-hole, because they refused to go to church;\nand one was shut four days into the tramp-room, with God knows what sort\nof company, and that while she was ill and receiving medicine!  Another\nwoman was placed in the insane department for punishment, though she was\nperfectly sane.  In the workhouse at Bacton, in Suffolk, in January,\n1844, a similar investigation revealed the fact that a feeble-minded\nwoman was employed as nurse, and took care of the patients accordingly;\nwhile sufferers, who were often restless at night, or tried to get up,\nwere tied fast with cords passed over the covering and under the\nbedstead, to save the nurses the trouble of sitting up at night.  One\npatient was found dead, bound in this way.  In the St. Pancras workhouse\nin London (where the cheap shirts already mentioned are made), an\nepileptic died of suffocation during an attack in bed, no one coming to\nhis relief; in the same house, four to six, sometimes eight children,\nslept in one bed.  In Shoreditch workhouse a man was placed, together\nwith a fever patient violently ill, in a bed teeming with vermin.  In\nBethnal Green workhouse, London, a woman in the sixth month of pregnancy\nwas shut up in the reception-room with her two-year-old child, from\nFebruary 28th to March 20th, without being admitted into the workhouse\nitself, and without a trace of a bed or the means of satisfying the most\nnatural wants.  Her husband, who was brought into the workhouse, begged\nto have his wife released from this imprisonment, whereupon he received\ntwenty-four hours imprisonment, with bread and water, as the penalty of\nhis insolence.  In the workhouse at Slough, near Windsor, a man lay dying\nin September, 1844.  His wife journeyed to him, arriving at midnight; and\nhastening to the workhouse, was refused admission.  She was not permitted\nto see her husband until the next morning, and then only in the presence\nof a female warder, who forced herself upon the wife at every succeeding\nvisit, sending her away at the end of half-an-hour.  In the workhouse at\nMiddleton, in Lancashire, twelve, and at times eighteen, paupers, of both\nsexes, slept in one room.  This institution is not embraced by the New\nPoor Law, but is administered under an old special act (Gilbert's Act).\nThe inspector had instituted a brewery in the house for his own benefit.\nIn Stockport, July 31st, 1844, a man, seventy-two years old, was brought\nbefore the Justice of the Peace for refusing to break stones, and\ninsisting that, by reason of his age and a stiff knee, he was unfit for\nhis work.  In vain did he offer to undertake any work adapted to his\nphysical strength; he was sentenced to two weeks upon the treadmill.  In\nthe workhouse at Basford, an inspecting official found that the sheets\nhad not been changed in thirteen weeks, shirts in four weeks, stockings\nin two to ten months, so that of forty-five boys but three had stockings,\nand all their shirts were in tatters.  The beds swarmed with vermin, and\nthe tableware was washed in the slop-pails.  In the west of London\nworkhouse, a porter who had infected four girls with syphilis was not\ndischarged, and another who had concealed a deaf and dumb girl four days\nand nights in his bed was also retained.\n\nAs in life, so in death.  The poor are dumped into the earth like\ninfected cattle.  The pauper burial-ground of St. Brides, London, is a\nbare morass, in use as a cemetery since the time of Charles II., and\nfilled with heaps of bones; every Wednesday the paupers are thrown into a\nditch fourteen feet deep; a curate rattles through the Litany at the top\nof his speed; the ditch is loosely covered in, to be re-opened the next\nWednesday, and filled with corpses as long as one more can be forced in.\nThe putrefaction thus engendered contaminates the whole neighbourhood.  In\nManchester, the pauper burial-ground lies opposite to the Old Town, along\nthe Irk: this, too, is a rough, desolate place.  About two years ago a\nrailroad was carried through it.  If it had been a respectable cemetery,\nhow the bourgeoisie and the clergy would have shrieked over the\ndesecration!  But it was a pauper burial-ground, the resting-place of the\noutcast and superfluous, so no one concerned himself about the matter.  It\nwas not even thought worth while to convey the partially decayed bodies\nto the other side of the cemetery; they were heaped up just as it\nhappened, and piles were driven into newly-made graves, so that the water\noozed out of the swampy ground, pregnant with putrefying matter, and\nfilled the neighbourhood with the most revolting and injurious gases.  The\ndisgusting brutality which accompanied this work I cannot describe in\nfurther detail.\n\nCan any one wonder that the poor decline to accept public relief under\nthese conditions?  That they starve rather than enter these bastilles?  I\nhave the reports of five cases in which persons actually starving, when\nthe guardians refused them outdoor relief, went back to their miserable\nhomes and died of starvation rather than enter these hells.  Thus far\nhave the Poor Law Commissioners attained their object.  At the same time,\nhowever, the workhouses have intensified, more than any other measure of\nthe party in power, the hatred of the working-class against the property-\nholders, who very generally admire the New Poor Law.\n\nFrom Newcastle to Dover, there is but one voice among the workers--the\nvoice of hatred against the new law.  The bourgeoisie has formulated so\nclearly in this law its conception of its duties towards the proletariat,\nthat it has been appreciated even by the dullest.  So frankly, so boldly\nhad the conception never yet been formulated, that the non-possessing\nclass exists solely for the purpose of being exploited, and of starving\nwhen the property-holders can no longer make use of it.  Hence it is that\nthis new Poor Law has contributed so greatly to accelerate the labour\nmovement, and especially to spread Chartism; and, as it is carried out\nmost extensively in the country, it facilitates the development of the\nproletarian movement which is arising in the agricultural districts.  Let\nme add that a similar law in force in Ireland since 1838, affords a\nsimilar refuge for eighty thousand paupers.  Here, too, it has made\nitself disliked, and would have been intensely hated if it had attained\nanything like the same importance as in England.  But what difference\ndoes the ill-treatment of eighty thousand proletarians make in a country\nin which there are two and a half millions of them?  In Scotland there\nare, with local exceptions, no Poor Laws.\n\nI hope that after this picture of the New Poor Law and its results, no\nword which I have said of the English bourgeoisie will be thought too\nstern.  In this public measure, in which it acts _in corpore_ as the\nruling power, it formulates its real intentions, reveals the animus of\nthose smaller transactions with the proletariat, of which the blame\napparently attaches to individuals.  And that this measure did not\noriginate with any one section of the bourgeoisie, but enjoys the\napproval of the whole class, is proved by the Parliamentary debates of\n1844.  The Liberal party had enacted the New Poor Law; the Conservative\nparty, with its Prime Minister Peel at the head, defends it, and only\nalters some petty-fogging trifles in the Poor Law Amendment Bill of 1844.\nA Liberal majority carried the bill, a Conservative majority approved it,\nand the \"Noble Lords\" gave their consent each time.  Thus is the\nexpulsion of the proletariat from State and society outspoken, thus is it\npublicly proclaimed that proletarians are not human beings, and do not\ndeserve to be treated as such.  Let us leave it to the proletarians of\nthe British Empire to re-conquer their human rights. {293}\n\nSuch is the state of the British working-class as I have come to know it\nin the course of twenty-one months, through the medium of my own eyes,\nand through official and other trustworthy reports.  And when I call this\ncondition, as I have frequently enough done in the foregoing pages, an\nutterly unbearable one, I am not alone in so doing.  As early as 1833,\nGaskell declared that he despaired of a peaceful issue, and that a\nrevolution can hardly fail to follow.  In 1838, Carlyle explained\nChartism and the revolutionary activity of the working-men as arising out\nof the misery in which they live, and only wondered that they have sat so\nquietly eight long years at the Barmecide feast, at which they have been\nregaled by the Liberal bourgeoisie with empty promises.  And in 1844 he\ndeclared that the work of organising labour must be begun at once \"if\nEurope or at least England, is long to remain inhabitable.\"  And the\n_Times_, the \"first journal of Europe,\" said in June, 1844: \"War to\npalaces, peace unto cabins--that is a battle-cry of terror which may come\nto resound throughout our country.  Let the wealthy beware!\"\n\n* * * * *\n\nMeanwhile, let us review once more the chances of the English\nbourgeoisie.  In the worst case, foreign manufacture, especially that of\nAmerica, may succeed in withstanding English competition, even after the\nrepeal of the Corn Laws, inevitable in the course of a few years.  German\nmanufacture is now making great efforts, and that of America has\ndeveloped with giant strides.  America, with its inexhaustible resources,\nwith its unmeasured coal and iron fields, with its unexampled wealth of\nwater-power and its navigable rivers, but especially with its energetic,\nactive population, in comparison with which the English are phlegmatic\ndawdlers,--America has in less than ten years created a manufacture which\nalready competes with England in the coarser cotton goods, has excluded\nthe English from the markets of North and South America, and holds its\nown in China, side by side with England.  If any country is adapted to\nholding a monopoly of manufacture, it is America.  Should English\nmanufacture be thus vanquished--and in the course of the next twenty\nyears, if the present conditions remain unchanged, this is inevitable--the\nmajority of the proletariat must become forever superfluous, and has no\nother choice than to starve or to rebel.  Does the English bourgeoisie\nreflect upon this contingency?  On the contrary; its favourite economist,\nM'Culloch, teaches from his student's desk, that a country so young as\nAmerica, which is not even properly populated, cannot carry on\nmanufacture successfully or dream of competing with an old manufacturing\ncountry like England.  It were madness in the Americans to make the\nattempt, for they could only lose by it; better far for them to stick to\ntheir agriculture, and when they have brought their whole territory under\nthe plough, a time may perhaps come for carrying on manufacture with a\nprofit.  So says the wise economist, and the whole bourgeoisie worships\nhim, while the Americans take possession of one market after another,\nwhile a daring American speculator recently even sent a shipment of\nAmerican cotton goods to England, where they were sold for\nre-exportation!\n\nBut assuming that England retained the monopoly of manufactures, that its\nfactories perpetually multiply, what must be the result?  The commercial\ncrises would continue, and grow more violent, more terrible, with the\nextension of industry and the multiplication of the proletariat.  The\nproletariat would increase in geometrical proportion, in consequence of\nthe progressive ruin of the lower middle-class and the giant strides with\nwhich capital is concentrating itself in the hands of the few; and the\nproletariat would soon embrace the whole nation, with the exception of a\nfew millionaires.  But in this development there comes a stage at which\nthe proletariat perceives how easily the existing power may be\noverthrown, and then follows a revolution.\n\nNeither of these supposed conditions may, however, be expected to arise.\nThe commercial crises, the mightiest levers for all independent\ndevelopment of the proletariat, will probably shorten the process, acting\nin concert with foreign competition and the deepening ruin of the lower\nmiddle-class.  I think the people will not endure more than one more\ncrisis.  The next one, in 1846 or 1847, will probably bring with it the\nrepeal of the Corn Laws {296} and the enactment of the Charter.  What\nrevolutionary movements the Charter may give rise to remains to be seen.\nBut, by the time of the next following crisis, which, according to the\nanalogy of its predecessors, must break out in 1852 or 1853, unless\ndelayed perhaps by the repeal of the Corn Laws or hastened by other\ninfluences, such as foreign competition--by the time this crisis arrives,\nthe English people will have had enough of being plundered by the\ncapitalists and left to starve when the capitalists no longer require\ntheir services.  If, up to that time, the English bourgeoisie does not\npause to reflect--and to all appearance it certainly will not do so--a\nrevolution will follow with which none hitherto known can be compared.\nThe proletarians, driven to despair, will seize the torch which Stephens\nhas preached to them; the vengeance of the people will come down with a\nwrath of which the rage of 1793 gives no true idea.  The war of the poor\nagainst the rich will be the bloodiest ever waged.  Even the union of a\npart of the bourgeoisie with the proletariat, even a general reform of\nthe bourgeoisie, would not help matters.  Besides, the change of heart of\nthe bourgeoisie could only go as far as a lukewarm _juste-milieu_; the\nmore determined, uniting with the workers, would only form a new Gironde,\nand succumb in the course of the mighty development.  The prejudices of a\nwhole class cannot be laid aside like an old coat: least of all, those of\nthe stable, narrow, selfish English bourgeoisie.  These are all\ninferences which may be drawn with the greatest certainty: conclusions,\nthe premises for which are undeniable facts, partly of historical\ndevelopment, partly facts inherent in human nature.  Prophecy is nowhere\nso easy as in England, where all the component elements of society are\nclearly defined and sharply separated.  The revolution must come; it is\nalready too late to bring about a peaceful solution; but it can be made\nmore gentle than that prophesied in the foregoing pages.  This depends,\nhowever, more upon the development of the proletariat than upon that of\nthe bourgeoisie.  In proportion, as the proletariat absorbs socialistic\nand communistic elements, will the revolution diminish in bloodshed,\nrevenge, and savagery.  Communism stands, in principle, above the breach\nbetween bourgeoisie and proletariat, recognises only its historic\nsignificance for the present, but not its justification for the future:\nwishes, indeed, to bridge over this chasm, to do away with all class\nantagonisms.  Hence it recognises as justified, so long as the struggle\nexists, the exasperation of the proletariat towards its oppressors as a\nnecessity, as the most important lever for a labour movement just\nbeginning; but it goes beyond this exasperation, because Communism is a\nquestion of humanity and not of the workers alone.  Besides, it does not\noccur to any Communist to wish to revenge himself upon individuals, or to\nbelieve that, in general, the single bourgeois can act otherwise, under\nexisting circumstances, than he does act.  English Socialism, _i.e_.\nCommunism, rests directly upon the irresponsibility of the individual.\nThus the more the English workers absorb communistic ideas, the more\nsuperfluous becomes their present bitterness, which, should it continue\nso violent as at present, could accomplish nothing; and the more their\naction against the bourgeoisie will lose its savage cruelty.  If, indeed,\nit were possible to make the whole proletariat communistic before the war\nbreaks out, the end would be very peaceful; but that is no longer\npossible, the time has gone by.  Meanwhile, I think that before the\noutbreak of open, declared war of the poor against the rich, there will\nbe enough intelligent comprehension of the social question among the\nproletariat, to enable the communistic party, with the help of events, to\nconquer the brutal element of the revolution and prevent a \"Ninth\nThermidor.\"  In any case, the experience of the French will not have been\nundergone in vain, and most of the Chartist leaders are, moreover,\nalready Communists.  And as Communism stands above the strife between\nbourgeoisie and proletariat, it will be easier for the better elements of\nthe bourgeoisie (which are, however, deplorably few, and can look for\nrecruits only among the rising generation) to unite with it than with\npurely proletarian Chartism.\n\nIf these conclusions have not been sufficiently established in the course\nof the present work, there may be other opportunities for demonstrating\nthat they are necessary consequences of the historical development of\nEngland.  But this I maintain, the war of the poor against the rich now\ncarried on in detail and indirectly will become direct and universal.  It\nis too late for a peaceful solution.  The classes are divided more and\nmore sharply, the spirit of resistance penetrates the workers, the\nbitterness intensifies, the guerilla skirmishes become concentrated in\nmore important battles, and soon a slight impulse will suffice to set the\navalanche in motion.  Then, indeed, will the war-cry resound through the\nland: \"War to the palaces, peace to the cottages!\"--but then it will be\ntoo late for the rich to beware.\n\n\n\n\nTRANSLATORS NOTE.\n\n\nBeing unable at this late day to obtain the original English, the\ntranslator has been compelled to re-translate from the German the\npassages quoted in the text from the following sources:--G.

The wearisome routine of endless drudgery, in which the\nsame mechanical process is ever repeated, is like the torture of\nSisyphus; the burden of toil, like the rock, is ever falling back upon\nthe worn-out drudge.  The mind attains neither knowledge nor the power of\nthought from the eternal employment of the same muscles.  The intellect\ndozes off in dull indolence, but the coarser part of our nature reaches a\nluxuriant development.  To condemn a human being to such work is to\ncultivate the animal quality in him.  He grows indifferent, he scorns the\nimpulses and customs which distinguish his kind.  He neglects the\nconveniences and finer pleasures of life, lives in filthy poverty with\nscanty nourishment, and squanders the rest of his earnings in\ndebauchery.\"--Dr. J.

These men will not learn because their supposed interest blinds\nthem.  As, moreover, many of their objections have been met in the\nforegoing, the following is all that it is necessary for me to add:\n\nYou come to Manchester, you wish to make yourself acquainted with the\nstate of affairs in England.  You naturally have good introductions to\nrespectable people.  You drop a remark or two as to the condition of the\nworkers.  You are made acquainted with a couple of the first Liberal\nmanufacturers, Robert Hyde Greg, perhaps, Edmund Ashworth, Thomas Ashton,\nor others.  They are told of your wishes.  The manufacturer understands\nyou, knows what he has to do.  He accompanies you to his factory in the\ncountry; Mr. Greg to Quarrybank in Cheshire, Mr. Ashworth to Turton near\nBolton, Mr. Ashton to Hyde.  He leads you through a superb, admirably\narranged building, perhaps supplied with ventilators, he calls your\nattention to the lofty, airy rooms, the fine machinery, here and there a\nhealthy-looking operative.  He gives you an excellent lunch, and proposes\nto you to visit the operatives' homes; he conducts you to the cottages,\nwhich look new, clean and neat, and goes with you into this one and that\none, naturally only to overlookers, mechanics, etc., so that you may see\n\"families who live wholly from the factory.\"  Among other families you\nmight find that only wife and children work, and the husband darns\nstockings.  The presence of the employer keeps you from asking indiscreet\nquestions; you find every one well-paid, comfortable, comparatively\nhealthy by reason of the country air; you begin to be converted from your\nexaggerated ideas of misery and starvation.  But, that the cottage system\nmakes slaves of the operatives, that there may be a truck shop in the\nneighbourhood, that the people hate the manufacturer, this they do not\npoint out to you, because he is present.  He has built a school, church,\nreading-room, etc.  That he uses the school to train children to\nsubordination, that he tolerates in the reading-room such prints only as\nrepresent the interests of the bourgeoisie, that he dismisses his\nemployees if they read Chartist or Socialist papers or books, this is all\nconcealed from you.  You see an easy, patriarchal relation, you see the\nlife of the overlookers, you see what the bourgeoisie _promises_ the\nworkers if they become its slaves, mentally and morally.  This \"country\nmanufacture\" has always been what the employers like to show, because in\nit the disadvantages of the factory system, especially from the point of\nview of health, are, in part, done away with by the free air and\nsurroundings, and because the patriarchal servitude of the workers can\nhere be longest maintained.  Dr. Ure sings a dithyramb upon the theme.\nBut woe to the operatives to whom it occurs to think for themselves and\nbecome Chartists!  For them the paternal affection of the manufacturer\ncomes to a sudden end.  Further, if you should wish to be accompanied\nthrough the working-people's quarters of Manchester, if you should desire\nto see the development of the factory system in a factory town, you may\nwait long before these rich bourgeoisie will help you!  These gentlemen\ndo not know in what condition their employees are nor what they want, and\nthey dare not know things which would make them uneasy or even oblige\nthem to act in opposition to their own interests.  But, fortunately, that\nis of no consequence: what the working-men have to carry out, they carry\nout for themselves.\n\n{189}  Grainger Report.

Hence I have not entered upon the\ndistinctions between the divers sections, subdivisions and parties of the\nbourgeoisie, which have a mere historical and theoretical significance.\nAnd I can, for the same reason, mention but casually the few members of\nthe bourgeoisie who have shown themselves honourable exceptions.  These\nare, on the one hand, the pronounced Radicals, who are almost Chartists,\nsuch as a few members of the House of Commons, the manufacturers Hindly\nof Ashton, and Fielden of Todmordon (Lancashire), and, on the other hand,\nthe philanthropic Tories, who have recently constituted themselves \"Young\nEngland,\" among whom are the members of Parliament, D'Israeli, Borthwick,\nFerrand, Lord John Manners, etc.  Lord Ashley, too, is in sympathy with\nthem.  The hope of Young England is a restoration of the old \"Merry\nEngland\" with its brilliant features and its romantic feudalism.  This\nobject is of course unattainable and ridiculous, a satire upon all\nhistoric development; but the good intention, the courage to resist the\nexisting state of things and prevalent prejudices, and to recognise the\nvileness of our present condition, is worth something anyhow.  Wholly\nisolated is the half-German Englishman, Thomas Carlyle, who, originally a\nTory, goes beyond all those hitherto mentioned.  He has sounded the\nsocial disorder more deeply than any other English bourgeois, and demands\nthe organisation of labour.\n\n{296}  And it did.\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING-CLASS\nIN ENGLAND IN 1844***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 17306.txt or 17306.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/1\/7\/3\/0\/17306\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1200,"split":"test"}
