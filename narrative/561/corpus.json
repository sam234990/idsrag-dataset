Dorothy goes into Ozma's chambers only to find she is not there.\nGlinda awakens in her palace in the Quadling Country and finds her Great Book of Records is missing. She goes to prepare a magic spell to find it- only to see her magic tools are gone as well. She dispatches a messenger to the Emerald City to relay news of the theft. Receiving the news, the Wizard hastily offers his magic tools to assist Glinda, however, these are missing as well. Glinda, Dorothy, and the Wizard organize search parties to find Ozma and the missing magic. Accompanying them are Button-Bright, Trot, and Betsy Bobbin. Dorothy and the Wizard's party begins to search the Winkie Country to the west of the Emerald City.\nMeanwhile, in the southwestern corner of the Winkie Country on a plateau belonging to the Yips, and Cayke the cookie cook has had her diamond-studded gold dishpan stolen. The self-proclaimed adviser to the Yips, a human-sized dandy of a frog called the Frogman, hears Cayke's story and offers to help her find the dishpan. When they have gotten down the mountain, Cayke reveals to the Frogman that the dishpan has magic powers, for her cookies come out perfect every time.\nDorothy, the Wizard, and their party enter the previously unknown communities of Thi and Herku. The citizens of Thi are ruled by the High Coco-Lorum (really the King, but the people do not know it) and repeat the same story about the Herkus: they keep giants for their slaves. In the Great Orchard between Thi and Herku, the party enjoys a variety of fruits. Button-Bright eats from the one peach tree in the orchard. When he reaches the peach's center he discovers it to be made of gold. He pockets the gold peach pit to show Dorothy, Betsy, and Trot later \u00e2\u0080\u0093 despite warnings from the local animals that the evil Ugu the Shoemaker has enchanted it.\nIn the city of Herku, Dorothy and the Wizard's party are greeted by the emaciated but jovial Czarover of Herku, who has invented a pure energy compound called zosozo that can make his people strong enough to keep giants as slaves. The Czarover offers them six doses to use in their travels and casually reveals that Ugu the Shoemaker came from Herku. Ugu found magic books in his attic one day because he was descended from the greatest enchanter ever known and learned over time to do a great many magical things. The Shoemaker has since moved from Herku and built a castle high in the mountains. This clue leads Dorothy and the Wizard to think that Ugu might be behind all the recent thefts of magic and the ruler of Oz. They proceed from Herku toward the castle and meet with the Frogman, Cayke the Cookie Cook, and the Lavender Bear the stuffed bear who rules Bear Center. Lavender Bear carries the Little Pink Bear a small wind-up toy that can answer any question about the past put to it.\nWhen the combined party arrives at Ugu's castle, Button-Bright is separated from them and falls into a pit. Before they rescue him, the Wizard asks the Little Pink Bear where Ozma is and it says that she is in the pit, too. After Button-Bright is let out of the pit, the Little Pink Bear says that she is there among the party. Unsure what to make of this seeming contradiction, the party advances toward the castle. Sure enough, Ugu is the culprit and the castle's magical defenses are techniques from Glinda and the Wizard. Upon overcoming these, the party finds themselves standing before the thief himself.\nUgu uses magic to send the room spinning and retreats. Dorothy stops it by making a wish with the magic belt. She uses its power to turn Ugu into a dove, but he modifies the enchantment so he retains human size and aggressive nature. Fighting his way past Dorothy and her companions, Ugu the dove uses Cayke's diamond-studded dishpan to flee to the Quadling Country.\nOnce the magic tools are recovered, the conquering search party turns their attention to finding Ozma. The Little Pink Bear reveals that Ozma is being carried in Button-Bright's jacket pocket, where he placed the gold peach pit. The Wizard opens it with a knife, and Ozma is released from where Ugu had imprisoned her. She was kidnapped by Ugu when she came upon him stealing her and the Wizard's magic instruments.\nThe people of the Emerald City and Ozma's friends all celebrate her return. Days later, the transformed Ugu flies in to see Dorothy and ask her forgiveness for what he did. She offers it and offers to change him back with the Magic Belt, but Ugu has decided that he likes being a dove much better.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Lost Princess of Oz, by L.

This\npleases me. Imagination has brought mankind through the Dark Ages to its\npresent state of civilization. Imagination led Columbus to discover\nAmerica. Imagination led Franklin to discover electricity. Imagination\nhas given us the steam engine, the telephone, the talking-machine and\nthe automobile, for these things had to be dreamed of before they became\nrealities. So I believe that dreams--day dreams, you know, with your\neyes wide open and your brain-machinery whizzing--are likely to lead to\nthe betterment of the world. The imaginative child will become the\nimaginative man or woman most apt to create, to invent, and therefore to\nfoster civilization. A prominent educator tells me that fairy tales are\nof untold value in developing imagination in the young. I believe it.\n\nAmong the letters I receive from children are many containing\nsuggestions of \"what to write about in the next Oz Book.\" Some of the\nideas advanced are mighty interesting, while others are too extravagant\nto be seriously considered--even in a fairy tale. Yet I like them all,\nand I must admit that the main idea in \"The Lost Princess of Oz\" was\nsuggested to me by a sweet little girl of eleven who called to see me\nand to talk about the Land of Oz. Said she: \"I s'pose if Ozma ever got\nlost, or stolen, ev'rybody in Oz would be dreadful sorry.\"\n\nThat was all, but quite enough foundation to build this present story\non. If you happen to like the story, give credit to my little friend's\nclever hint. And, by the way, don't hesitate to write me your own hints\nand suggestions, such as result from your own day dreams. They will be\nsure to interest me, even if I cannot use them in a story, and the very\nfact that you have dreamed at all will give me pleasure and do you good.\nFor, after all, dear reader, these stories of Oz are just yours and\nmine, and we are partners. As long as you care to read them I shall try\nto write them, and I've an idea that the next one will relate some\nstartling adventures of the \"Tin Woodman of Oz\" and his comrades.\n\n  L.

She had completely disappeared.\nNot one of her subjects--not even her closest friends--knew what had\nbecome of her.\n\nIt was Dorothy who first discovered it. Dorothy was a little Kansas girl\nwho had come to the Land of Oz to live and had been given a delightful\nsuite of rooms in Ozma's royal palace, just because Ozma loved Dorothy\nand wanted her to live as near her as possible, so the two girls might\nbe much together.\n\nDorothy was not the only girl from the outside world who had been\nwelcomed to Oz and lived in the royal palace. There was another named\nBetsy Bobbin, whose adventures had led her to seek refuge with Ozma, and\nstill another named Trot, who had been invited, together with her\nfaithful companion, Cap'n Bill, to make her home in this wonderful\nfairyland. The three girls all had rooms in the palace and were great\nchums; but Dorothy was the dearest friend of their gracious Ruler and\nonly she at any hour dared to seek Ozma in her royal apartments. For\nDorothy had lived in Oz much longer than the other girls and had been\nmade a Princess of the realm.\n\nBetsy was a year older than Dorothy and Trot was a year younger, yet the\nthree were near enough of an age to become great playmates and to have\nnice times together. It was while the three were talking together one\nmorning in Dorothy's room that Betsy proposed they make a journey into\nthe Munchkin Country, which was one of the four great countries of the\nLand of Oz ruled by Ozma.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I've never been there yet,\" said Betsy Bobbin, \"but the Scarecrow\nonce told me it is the prettiest country in all Oz.\"\n\n\"I'd like to go, too,\" added Trot.\n\n\"All right,\" said Dorothy, \"I'll go and ask Ozma. Perhaps she will let\nus take the Sawhorse and the Red Wagon, which would be much nicer for us\nthan having to walk all the way. This Land of Oz is a pretty big place,\nwhen you get to all the edges of it.\"\n\nSo she jumped up and went along the halls of the splendid palace until\nshe came to the royal suite, which filled all the front of the second\nfloor. In a little waiting room sat Ozma's maid, Jellia Jamb, who was\nbusily sewing.\n\n\"Is Ozma up yet?\" inquired Dorothy.\n\n\"I don't know, my dear,\" replied Jellia. \"I haven't heard a word from\nher this morning. She hasn't even called for her bath or her breakfast,\nand it is far past her usual time for them.\"\n\n\"That's strange!\" exclaimed the little girl.\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed the maid; \"but of course no harm could have happened to\nher. No one can die or be killed in the Land of Oz and Ozma is herself a\npowerful fairy, and she has no enemies, so far as we know. Therefore I\nam not at all worried about her, though I must admit her silence is\nunusual.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Dorothy, thoughtfully, \"she has overslept. Or she may be\nreading, or working out some new sort of magic to do good to her\npeople.\"\n\n\"Any of these things may be true,\" replied Jellia Jamb, \"so I haven't\ndared disturb our royal mistress. You, however, are a privileged\ncharacter, Princess, and I am sure that Ozma wouldn't mind at all if you\nwent in to see her.\"\n\n\"Of course not,\" said Dorothy, and opening the door of the outer chamber\nshe went in. All was still here. She walked into another room, which was\nOzma's boudoir, and then, pushing back a heavy drapery richly broidered\nwith threads of pure gold, the girl entered the sleeping-room of the\nfairy Ruler of Oz. The bed of ivory and gold was vacant; the room was\nvacant; not a trace of Ozma was to be found.\n\nVery much surprised, yet still with no fear that anything had happened\nto her friend, Dorothy returned through the boudoir to the other rooms\nof the suite. She went into the music room, the library, the laboratory,\nthe bath, the wardrobe and even into the great throne room, which\nadjoined the royal suite, but in none of these places could she find\nOzma.\n\nSo she returned to the anteroom where she had left the maid, Jellia\nJamb, and said:\n\n\"She isn't in her rooms now, so she must have gone out.\"\n\n\"I don't understand how she could do that without my seeing her,\"\nreplied Jellia, \"unless she made herself invisible.\"\n\n\"She isn't there, anyhow,\" declared Dorothy.\n\n\"Then let us go find her,\" suggested the maid, who appeared to be a\nlittle uneasy.\n\nSo they went into the corridors and there Dorothy almost stumbled over a\nqueer girl who was dancing lightly along the passage.\n\n\"Stop a minute, Scraps!\" she called. \"Have you seen Ozma this morning?\"\n\n\"Not I!\" replied the queer girl, dancing nearer. \"I lost both my eyes in\na tussle with the Woozy, last night, for the creature scraped 'em both\noff my face with his square paws. So I put the eyes in my pocket and\nthis morning Button-Bright led me to Aunt Em, who sewed 'em on again. So\nI've seen nothing at all to-day, except during the last five minutes. So\nof course I haven't seen Ozma.\"\n\n\"Very well, Scraps,\" said Dorothy, looking curiously at the eyes, which\nwere merely two round black buttons sewed upon the girl's face.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThere were other things about Scraps that would have seemed curious to\none seeing her for the first time. She was commonly called \"The\nPatchwork Girl,\" because her body and limbs were made from a gay-colored\npatchwork quilt which had been cut into shape and stuffed with cotton.\nHer head was a round ball stuffed in the same manner and fastened to her\nshoulders. For hair she had a mass of brown yarn and to make a nose for\nher a part of the cloth had been pulled out into the shape of a knob and\ntied with a string to hold it in place. Her mouth had been carefully\nmade by cutting a slit in the proper place and lining it with red silk,\nadding two rows of pearls for teeth and a bit of red flannel for a\ntongue.\n\nIn spite of this queer make-up, the Patchwork Girl was magically alive\nand had proved herself not the least jolly and agreeable of the many\nquaint characters who inhabit the astonishing Fairyland of Oz. Indeed,\nScraps was a general favorite, although she was rather flighty and\nerratic and did and said many things that surprised her friends. She was\nseldom still, but loved to dance, to turn handsprings and somersaults,\nto climb trees and to indulge in many other active sports.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I'm going to search for Ozma,\" remarked Dorothy, \"for she isn't in\nher rooms and I want to ask her a question.\"\n\n\"I'll go with you,\" said Scraps, \"for my eyes are brighter than yours\nand they can see farther.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure of that,\" returned Dorothy. \"But come along, if you like.\"\n\nTogether they searched all through the great palace and even to the\nfarthest limits of the palace grounds, which were quite extensive, but\nnowhere could they find a trace of Ozma. When Dorothy returned to where\nBetsy and Trot awaited her, the little girl's face was rather solemn and\ntroubled, for never before had Ozma gone away without telling her\nfriends where she was going, or without an escort that befitted her\nroyal state.\n\nShe was gone, however, and none had seen her go. Dorothy had met and\nquestioned the Scarecrow, Tik-Tok, the Shaggy Man, Button-Bright, Cap'n\nBill, and even the wise and powerful Wizard of Oz, but not one of them\nhad seen Ozma since she parted with her friends the evening before and\nhad gone to her own rooms.\n\n\"She didn't say anything las' night about going anywhere,\" observed\nlittle Trot.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"No, and that's the strange part of it,\" replied Dorothy. \"Usually\nOzma lets us know of everything she does.\"\n\n\"Why not look in the Magic Picture?\" suggested Betsy Bobbin. \"That will\ntell us where she is, in just one second.\"\n\n\"Of course!\" cried Dorothy. \"Why didn't I think of that before?\" and at\nonce the three girls hurried away to Ozma's boudoir, where the Magic\nPicture always hung.\n\nThis wonderful Magic Picture was one of the royal Ozma's greatest\ntreasures. There was a large gold frame, in the center of which was a\nbluish-gray canvas on which various scenes constantly appeared and\ndisappeared. If one who stood before it wished to see what any\nperson--anywhere in the world--was doing, it was only necessary to make\nthe wish and the scene in the Magic Picture would shift to the scene\nwhere that person was and show exactly what he or she was then engaged\nin doing. So the girls knew it would be easy for them to wish to see\nOzma, and from the picture they could quickly learn where she was.\n\nDorothy advanced to the place where the picture was usually protected by\nthick satin curtains, and pulled the draperies aside. Then she stared in\namazement, while her two friends uttered exclamations of\ndisappointment.\n\nThe Magic Picture was gone. Only a blank space on the wall behind the\ncurtains showed where it had formerly hung.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nThe Troubles of Glinda the Good\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n\nThat same morning there was great excitement in the castle of the\npowerful Sorceress of Oz, Glinda the Good. This castle, situated in the\nQuadling Country, far south of the Emerald City where Ozma ruled, was a\nsplendid structure of exquisite marbles and silver grilles. Here the\nSorceress lived, surrounded by a bevy of the most beautiful maidens of\nOz, gathered from all the four countries of that fairyland as well as\nfrom the magnificent Emerald City itself, which stood in the place\nwhere the four countries cornered.\n\nIt was considered a great honor to be allowed to serve the good\nSorceress, whose arts of magic were used only to benefit the Oz people.\nGlinda was Ozma's most valued servant, for her knowledge of sorcery was\nwonderful and she could accomplish almost anything that her mistress,\nthe lovely girl Ruler of Oz, wished her to.\n\nOf all the magical things which surrounded Glinda in her castle there\nwas none more marvelous than her Great Book of Records. On the pages of\nthis Record Book were constantly being inscribed--day by day and hour by\nhour--all the important events that happened anywhere in the known\nworld, and they were inscribed in the book at exactly the moment the\nevents happened. Every adventure in the Land of Oz and in the big\noutside world, and even in places that you and I have never heard of,\nwere recorded accurately in the Great Book, which never made a mistake\nand stated only the exact truth. For that reason nothing could be\nconcealed from Glinda the Good, who had only to look at the pages of the\nGreat Book of Records to know everything that had taken place. That was\none reason she was such a great Sorceress, for the records made her\nwiser than any other living person.\n\nThis wonderful book was placed upon a big gold table that stood in the\nmiddle of Glinda's drawing-room. The legs of the table, which were\nincrusted with precious gems, were firmly fastened to the tiled floor\nand the book itself was chained to the table and locked with six stout\ngolden padlocks, the keys to which Glinda carried on a chain that was\nsecured around her own neck.\n\nThe pages of the Great Book were larger in size than those of an\nAmerican newspaper and although they were exceedingly thin there were so\nmany of them that they made an enormous, bulky volume. With its gold\ncover and gold clasps the book was so heavy that three men could\nscarcely have lifted it. Yet this morning, when Glinda entered her\ndrawing-room after breakfast, with all her maidens trailing after her,\nthe good Sorceress was amazed to discover that her Great Book of Records\nhad mysteriously disappeared.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAdvancing to the table, she found the chains had been cut with some\nsharp instrument, and this must have been done while all in the castle\nslept. Glinda was shocked and grieved. Who could have done this\nwicked, bold thing? And who could wish to deprive her of her Great Book\nof Records?\n\nThe Sorceress was thoughtful for a time, considering the consequences of\nher loss. Then she went to her Room of Magic to prepare a charm that\nwould tell her who had stolen the Record Book. But, when she unlocked\nher cupboards and threw open the doors, all of her magical instruments\nand rare chemical compounds had been removed from the shelves.\n\nThe Sorceress was now both angry and alarmed. She sat down in a chair\nand tried to think how this extraordinary robbery could have taken\nplace. It was evident that the thief was some person of very great\npower, or the theft could never have been accomplished without her\nknowledge. But who, in all the Land of Oz, was powerful and skillful\nenough to do this awful thing? And who, having the power, could also\nhave an object in defying the wisest and most talented Sorceress the\nworld has ever known?\n\n[Illustration]\n\nGlinda thought over the perplexing matter for a full hour, at the end of\nwhich time she was still puzzled how to explain it. But although her\ninstruments and chemicals were gone her _knowledge_ of magic had not\nbeen stolen, by any means, since no thief, however skillful, can rob one\nof knowledge, and that is why knowledge is the best and safest\ntreasure to acquire. Glinda believed that when she had time to gather\nmore magical herbs and elixirs and to manufacture more magical\ninstruments she would be able to discover who the robber was, and what\nhad become of her precious Book of Records.\n\n\"Whoever has done this,\" she said to her maidens, \"is a very foolish\nperson, for in time he is sure to be found out and will then be severely\npunished.\"\n\nShe now made a list of the things she needed and dispatched messengers\nto every part of Oz with instructions to obtain them and bring them to\nher as soon as possible. And one of her messengers met the little Wizard\nof Oz, who was mounted on the back of the famous live Sawhorse and was\nclinging to its neck with both his arms; for the Sawhorse was speeding\nto Glinda's castle with the velocity of the wind, bearing the news that\nRoyal Ozma, Ruler of all the great Land of Oz, had suddenly disappeared\nand no one in the Emerald City knew what had become of her.\n\n\"Also,\" said the Wizard, as he stood before the astonished Sorceress,\n\"Ozma's Magic Picture is gone, so we cannot consult it to discover where\nshe is. So I came to you for assistance as soon as we realized our loss.\nLet us look in the Great Book of Records.\"\n\n\"Alas,\" returned the Sorceress sorrowfully, \"we cannot do that, for the\nGreat Book of Records has also disappeared!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nRobbery of Cayke the Cookie Cook\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n\nOne more important theft was reported in the Land of Oz that eventful\nmorning, but it took place so far from either the Emerald City or the\ncastle of Glinda the Good that none of those persons we have mentioned\nlearned of the robbery until long afterward.\n\nIn the far southwestern corner of the Winkie Country is a broad\ntableland that can be reached only by climbing a steep hill, whichever\nside one approaches it. On the hillside surrounding this tableland are\nno paths at all, but there are quantities of bramble-bushes with sharp\nprickers on them, which prevent any of the Oz people who live down below\nfrom climbing up to see what is on top. But on top live the Yips, and\nalthough the space they occupy is not great in extent the wee country is\nall their own. The Yips had never--up to the time this story\nbegins--left their broad tableland to go down into the Land of Oz, nor\nhad the Oz people ever climbed up to the country of the Yips.\n\nLiving all alone as they did, the Yips had queer ways and notions of\ntheir own and did not resemble any other people of the Land of Oz. Their\nhouses were scattered all over the flat surface; not like a city,\ngrouped together, but set wherever their owners' fancy dictated, with\nfields here, trees there, and odd little paths connecting the houses one\nwith another.\n\nIt was here, on the morning when Ozma so strangely disappeared from the\nEmerald City, that Cayke the Cookie Cook discovered that her\ndiamond-studded gold dishpan had been stolen, and she raised such a\nhue-and-cry over her loss and wailed and shrieked so loudly that many of\nthe Yips gathered around her house to inquire what was the matter.\n\nIt was a serious thing, in any part of the Land of Oz, to accuse one of\nstealing, so when the Yips heard Cayke the Cookie Cook declare that her\njeweled dishpan had been stolen they were both humiliated and disturbed\nand forced Cayke to go with them to the Frogman to see what could be\ndone about it.\n\nI do not suppose you have ever before heard of the Frogman, for like all\nother dwellers on that tableland he had never been away from it, nor had\nanyone come up there to see him. The Frogman was, in truth, descended\nfrom the common frogs of Oz, and when he was first born he lived in a\npool in the Winkie Country and was much like any other frog. Being of an\nadventurous nature, however, he soon hopped out of his pool and began to\ntravel, when a big bird came along and seized him in its beak and\nstarted to fly away with him to its nest. When high in the air the frog\nwriggled so frantically that he got loose and fell down--down--down into\na small hidden pool on the tableland of the Yips. Now this pool, it\nseems, was unknown to the Yips because it was surrounded by thick bushes\nand was not near to any dwelling, and it proved to be an enchanted pool,\nfor the frog grew very fast and very big, feeding on the magic skosh\nwhich is found nowhere else on earth except in that one pool. And the\nskosh not only made the frog very big, so that when he stood on his hind\nlegs he was tall as any Yip in the country, but it made him unusually\nintelligent, so that he soon knew more than the Yips did and was able to\nreason and to argue very well indeed.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nNo one could expect a frog with these talents to remain in a hidden\npool, so he finally got out of it and mingled with the people of the\ntableland, who were amazed at his appearance and greatly impressed by\nhis learning. They had never seen a frog before and the frog had never\nseen a Yip before, but as there were plenty of Yips and only one frog,\nthe frog became the most important. He did not hop any more, but stood\nupright on his hind legs and dressed himself in fine clothes and sat in\nchairs and did all the things that people do; so he soon came to be\ncalled the Frogman, and that is the only name he has ever had.\n\nAfter some years had passed the people came to regard the Frogman as\ntheir adviser in all matters that puzzled them. They brought all their\ndifficulties to him and when he did not know anything he pretended to\nknow it, which seemed to answer just as well. Indeed, the Yips thought\nthe Frogman was much wiser than he really was, and he allowed them to\nthink so, being very proud of his position of authority.\n\nThere was another pool on the tableland, which was not enchanted but\ncontained good clear water and was located close to the dwellings. Here\nthe people built the Frogman a house of his own, close to the edge of\nthe pool, so that he could take a bath or a swim whenever he wished. He\nusually swam in the pool in the early morning, before anyone else was\nup, and during the day he dressed himself in his beautiful clothes and\nsat in his house and received the visits of all the Yips who came to him\nto ask his advice.\n\nThe Frogman's usual costume consisted of knee-breeches made of yellow\nsatin plush, with trimmings of gold braid and jeweled knee-buckles; a\nwhite satin vest with silver buttons in which were set solitaire rubies;\na swallow-tailed coat of bright yellow; green stockings and red leather\nshoes turned up at the toes and having diamond buckles. He wore, when he\nwalked out, a purple silk hat and carried a gold-headed cane. Over his\neyes he wore great spectacles with gold rims, not because his eyes were\nbad but because the spectacles made him look wise, and so distinguished\nand gorgeous was his appearance that all the Yips were very proud of\nhim.\n\nThere was no King or Queen in the Yip Country, so the simple inhabitants\nnaturally came to look upon the Frogman as their leader as well as their\ncounselor in all times of emergency. In his heart the big frog knew he\nwas no wiser than the Yips, but for a frog to know as much as a person\nwas quite remarkable, and the Frogman was shrewd enough to make the\npeople believe he was far more wise than he really was. They never\nsuspected he was a humbug, but listened to his words with great respect\nand did just what he advised them to do.\n\nNow, when Cayke the Cookie Cook raised such an outcry over the theft of\nher diamond-studded dishpan, the first thought of the people was to take\nher to the Frogman and inform him of the loss, thinking that of course\nhe could tell her where to find it.\n\nHe listened to the story with his big eyes wide open behind his\nspectacles, and said in his deep, croaking voice:\n\n\"If the dishpan is stolen, somebody must have taken it.\"\n\n\"But who?\" asked Cayke, anxiously. \"Who is the thief?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"The one who took the dishpan, of course,\" replied the Frogman, and\nhearing this all the Yips nodded their heads gravely and said to one\nanother:\n\n\"It is absolutely true!\"\n\n\"But I want my dishpan!\" cried Cayke.\n\n\"No one can blame you for that wish,\" remarked the Frogman.\n\n\"Then tell me where I may find it,\" she urged.\n\nThe look the Frogman gave her was a very wise look and he rose from his\nchair and strutted up and down the room with his hands under his\ncoat-tails, in a very pompous and imposing manner. This was the first\ntime so difficult a matter had been brought to him and he wanted time to\nthink. It would never do to let them suspect his ignorance and so he\nthought very, very hard how best to answer the woman without betraying\nhimself.\n\n\"I beg to inform you,\" said he, \"that nothing in the Yip Country has\never been stolen before.\"\n\n\"We know that, already,\" answered Cayke the Cookie Cook, impatiently.\n\n\"Therefore,\" continued the Frogman, \"this theft becomes a very important\nmatter.\"\n\n\"Well, where is my dishpan?\" demanded the woman.\n\n\"It is lost; but it must be found. Unfortunately, we have no policemen\nor detectives to unravel the mystery, so we must employ other means to\nregain the lost article. Cayke must first write a Proclamation and tack\nit to the door of her house, and the Proclamation must read that whoever\nstole the jeweled dishpan must return it at once.\"\n\n\"But suppose no one returns it,\" suggested Cayke.\n\n\"Then,\" said the Frogman, \"that very fact will be proof that no one has\nstolen it.\"\n\nCayke was not satisfied, but the other Yips seemed to approve the plan\nhighly. They all advised her to do as the Frogman had told her to, so\nshe posted the sign on her door and waited patiently for someone to\nreturn the dishpan--which no one ever did.\n\nAgain she went, accompanied by a group of her neighbors, to the Frogman,\nwho by this time had given the matter considerable thought. Said he to\nCayke:\n\n\"I am now convinced that no Yip has taken your dishpan, and, since it is\ngone from the Yip Country, I suspect that some stranger came from the\nworld down below us, in the darkness of night when all of us were\nasleep, and took away your treasure. There can be no other explanation\nof its disappearance. So, if you wish to recover that golden,\ndiamond-studded dishpan, you must go into the lower world after it.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThis was indeed a startling proposition. Cayke and her friends went to\nthe edge of the flat tableland and looked down the steep hillside to the\nplains below. It was so far to the bottom of the hill that nothing there\ncould be seen very distinctly and it seemed to the Yips very\nventuresome, if not dangerous, to go so far from home into an unknown\nland.\n\nHowever, Cayke wanted her dishpan very badly, so she turned to her\nfriends and asked:\n\n\"Who will go with me?\"\n\nNo one answered this question, but after a period of silence one of the\nYips said:\n\n\"We know what is here, on the top of this flat hill, and it seems to us\na very pleasant place; but what is down below we do not know. The\nchances are it is not so pleasant, so we had best stay where we are.\"\n\n\"It may be a far better country than this is,\" suggested the Cookie\nCook.\n\n\"Maybe, maybe,\" responded another Yip, \"but why take chances?\nContentment with one's lot is true wisdom. Perhaps, in some other\ncountry, there are better cookies than you cook; but as we have always\neaten your cookies, and liked them--except when they are burned on the\nbottom--we do not long for any better ones.\"\n\nCayke might have agreed to this argument had she not been so anxious to\nfind her precious dishpan, but now she exclaimed impatiently:\n\n\"You are cowards--all of you! If none of you are willing to explore with\nme the great world beyond this small hill, I will surely go alone.\"\n\n\"That is a wise resolve,\" declared the Yips, much relieved. \"It is your\ndishpan that is lost, not ours; and, if you are willing to risk your\nlife and liberty to regain it, no one can deny you the privilege.\"\n\nWhile they were thus conversing the Frogman joined them and looked down\nat the plain with his big eyes and seemed unusually thoughtful. In fact,\nthe Frogman was thinking that he'd like to see more of the world. Here\nin the Yip Country he had become the most important creature of them all\nand his importance was getting to be a little tame. It would be nice to\nhave other people defer to him and ask his advice and there seemed no\nreason, so far as he could see, why his fame should not spread\nthroughout all Oz.\n\nHe knew nothing of the rest of the world, but it was reasonable to\nbelieve that there were more people beyond the mountain where he now\nlived than there were Yips, and if he went among them he could surprise\nthem with his display of wisdom and make them bow down to him as the\nYips did. In other words, the Frogman was ambitious to become still\ngreater than he was, which was impossible if he always remained upon\nthis mountain. He wanted others to see his gorgeous clothes and listen\nto his solemn sayings, and here was an excuse for him to get away from\nthe Yip Country. So he said to Cayke the Cookie Cook:\n\n\"_I_ will go with you, my good woman,\" which greatly pleased Cayke\nbecause she felt the Frogman could be of much assistance to her in her\nsearch.\n\nBut now, since the mighty Frogman had decided to undertake the journey,\nseveral of the Yips who were young and daring at once made up their\nminds to go along; so the next morning after breakfast the Frogman and\nCayke the Cookie Cook and nine of the Yips started to slide down the\nside of the mountain. The bramble-bushes and cactus plants were very\nprickly and uncomfortable to the touch, so the Frogman commanded the\nYips to go first and break a path, so that when he followed them he\nwould not tear his splendid clothes. Cayke, too, was wearing her best\ndress, and was likewise afraid of the thorns and prickers, so she kept\nbehind the Frogman.\n\nThey made rather slow progress and night overtook them before they were\nhalfway down the mountain side, so they found a cave in which they\nsought shelter until morning. Cayke had brought along a basket full of\nher famous cookies, so they all had plenty to eat.\n\nOn the second day the Yips began to wish they had not embarked on this\nadventure. They grumbled a good deal at having to cut away the thorns to\nmake the path for the Frogman and the Cookie Cook, for their own\nclothing suffered many tears, while Cayke and the Frogman traveled\nsafely and in comfort.\n\n\"If it is true that anyone came to our country to steal your diamond\ndishpan,\" said one of the Yips to Cayke, \"it must have been a bird, for\nno person in the form of a man, woman or child could have climbed\nthrough these bushes and back again.\"\n\n\"And, allowing he could have done so,\" said another Yip, \"the\ndiamond-studded gold dishpan would not have repaid him for his troubles\nand his tribulations.\"\n\n\"For my part,\" remarked a third Yip, \"I would rather go back home and\ndig and polish some more diamonds, and mine some more gold, and make\nyou another dishpan, than be scratched from head to heel by these\ndreadful bushes. Even now, if my mother saw me, she would not know I am\nher son.\"\n\nCayke paid no heed to these mutterings, nor did the Frogman. Although\ntheir journey was slow it was being made easy for them by the Yips, so\nthey had nothing to complain of and no desire to turn back.\n\nQuite near to the bottom of the great hill they came upon a deep gulf,\nthe sides of which were as smooth as glass. The gulf extended a long\ndistance--as far as they could see, in either direction--and although it\nwas not very wide it was far too wide for the Yips to leap across it.\nAnd, should they fall into it, it was likely they might never get out\nagain.\n\n\"Here our journey ends,\" said the Yips. \"We must go back again.\"\n\nCayke the Cookie Cook began to weep.\n\n\"I shall never find my pretty dishpan again--and my heart will be\nbroken!\" she sobbed.\n\nThe Frogman went to the edge of the gulf and with his eye carefully\nmeasured the distance to the other side.\n\n\"Being a frog,\" said he, \"I can leap, as all frogs do; and, being so big\nand strong, I am sure I can leap across this gulf with ease. But the\nrest of you, not being frogs, must return the way you came.\"\n\n\"We will do that with pleasure,\" cried the Yips and at once they turned\nand began to climb up the steep mountain, feeling they had had quite\nenough of this unsatisfactory adventure. Cayke the Cookie Cook did not\ngo with them, however. She sat on a rock and wept and wailed and was\nvery miserable.\n\n\"Well,\" said the Frogman to her, \"I will now bid you good-bye. If I find\nyour diamond decorated gold dishpan I will promise to see that it is\nsafely returned to you.\"\n\n\"But I prefer to find it myself!\" she said. \"See here, Frogman, why\ncan't you carry me across the gulf when you leap it? You are big and\nstrong, while I am small and thin.\"\n\nThe Frogman gravely thought over this suggestion. It was a fact that\nCayke the Cookie Cook was not a heavy person. Perhaps he could leap the\ngulf with her on his back.\n\n\"If you are willing to risk a fall,\" said he, \"I will make the attempt.\"\n\nAt once she sprang up and grabbed him around his neck with both her\narms. That is, she grabbed him where his neck ought to be, for the\nFrogman had no neck at all. Then he squatted down, as frogs do when\nthey leap, and with his powerful rear legs he made a tremendous jump.\n\nOver the gulf he sailed, with the Cookie Cook on his back, and he had\nleaped so hard--to make sure of not falling in--that he sailed over a\nlot of bramble-bushes that grew on the other side and landed in a clear\nspace which was so far beyond the gulf that when they looked back they\ncould not see it at all.\n\nCayke now got off the Frogman's back and he stood erect again and\ncarefully brushed the dust from his velvet coat and rearranged his white\nsatin necktie.\n\n\"I had no idea I could leap so far,\" he said wonderingly. \"Leaping is\none more accomplishment I can now add to the long list of deeds I am\nable to perform.\"\n\n\"You are certainly fine at leap-frog,\" said the Cookie Cook, admiringly;\n\"but, as you say, you are wonderful in many ways. If we meet with any\npeople down here I am sure they will consider you the greatest and\ngrandest of all living creatures.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Yes,\" he replied, \"I shall probably astonish strangers, because they\nhave never before had the pleasure of seeing me. Also they will marvel\nat my great learning. Every time I open my mouth, Cayke, I am liable\nto say something important.\"\n\n\"That is true,\" she agreed, \"and it is fortunate your mouth is so very\nwide and opens so far, for otherwise all the wisdom might not be able to\nget out of it.\"\n\n\"Perhaps nature made it wide for that very reason,\" said the Frogman:\n\"But come; let us now go on, for it is getting late and we must find\nsome sort of shelter before night overtakes us.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nAmong the Winkies\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n\nThe settled parts of the Winkie Country are full of happy and contented\npeople who are ruled by a tin Emperor named Nick Chopper, who in turn is\na subject of the beautiful girl Ruler, Ozma of Oz. But not all of the\nWinkie Country is fully settled. At the east, which part lies nearest\nthe Emerald City, there are beautiful farmhouses and roads, but as you\ntravel west you first come to a branch of the Winkie River, beyond\nwhich there is a rough country where few people live, and some of these\nare quite unknown to the rest of the world. After passing through this\nrude section of territory, which no one ever visits, you would come to\nstill another branch of the Winkie River, after crossing which you would\nfind another well-settled part of the Winkie Country, extending westward\nquite to the Deadly Desert that surrounds all the Land of Oz and\nseparates that favored fairyland from the more common outside world. The\nWinkies who live in this west section have many tin mines, from which\nmetal they make a great deal of rich jewelry and other articles, all of\nwhich are highly esteemed in the Land of Oz because tin is so bright and\npretty, and there is not so much of it as there is of gold and silver.\n\nNot all the Winkies are miners, however, for some till the fields and\ngrow grains for food, and it was at one of these far west Winkie farms\nthat the Frogman and Cayke the Cookie Cook first arrived after they had\ndescended from the mountain of the Yips.\n\n\"Goodness me!\" cried Nellary, the Winkie wife, when she saw the strange\ncouple approaching her house. \"I have seen many queer creatures in the\nLand of Oz, but none more queer than this giant frog, who dresses like\na man and walks on his hind legs. Come here, Wiljon,\" she called to her\nhusband, who was eating his breakfast, \"and take a look at this\nastonishing freak.\"\n\nWiljon the Winkie came to the door and looked out. He was still standing\nin the doorway when the Frogman approached and said with a haughty\ncroak:\n\n\"Tell me, my good man, have you seen a diamond-studded gold dishpan?\"\n\n\"No; nor have I seen a copper-plated lobster,\" replied Wiljon, in an\nequally haughty tone.\n\nThe Frogman stared at him and said:\n\n\"Do not be insolent, fellow!\"\n\n\"No,\" added Cayke the Cookie Cook, hastily, \"you must be very polite to\nthe great Frogman, for he is the wisest creature in all the world.\"\n\n\"Who says that?\" inquired Wiljon.\n\n\"He says so himself,\" replied Cayke, and the Frogman nodded and strutted\nup and down, twirling his gold-headed cane very gracefully.\n\n\"Does the Scarecrow admit that this overgrown frog is the wisest\ncreature in the world?\" asked Wiljon.\n\n\"I do not know who the Scarecrow is,\" answered Cayke the Cookie Cook.\n\n\"Well, he lives at the Emerald City, and he is supposed to have the\nfinest brains in all Oz. The Wizard gave them to him, you know.\"\n\n\"Mine grew in my head,\" said the Frogman pompously, \"so I think they\nmust be better than any wizard brains. I am so wise that sometimes my\nwisdom makes my head ache. I know so much that often I have to forget\npart of it, since no one creature, however great, is able to contain so\nmuch knowledge.\"\n\n\"It must be dreadful to be stuffed full of wisdom,\" remarked Wiljon\nreflectively, and eyeing the Frogman with a doubtful look. \"It is my\ngood fortune to know very little.\"\n\n\"I hope, however, you know where my jeweled dishpan is,\" said the Cookie\nCook anxiously.\n\n\"I do not know even that,\" returned the Winkie. \"We have trouble enough\nin keeping track of our own dishpans, without meddling with the dishpans\nof strangers.\"\n\nFinding him so ignorant, the Frogman proposed that they walk on and seek\nCayke's dishpan elsewhere. Wiljon the Winkie did not seem greatly\nimpressed by the great Frogman, which seemed to that personage as\nstrange as it was disappointing; but others in this unknown land might\nprove more respectful.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I'd like to meet that Wizard of Oz,\" remarked Cayke, as they walked\nalong a path. \"If he could give a Scarecrow brains he might be able to\nfind my dishpan.\"\n\n\"Poof!\" grunted the Frogman scornfully; \"I am greater than any wizard.\nDepend on _me_. If your dishpan is anywhere in the world I am sure to\nfind it.\"\n\n\"If you do not, my heart will be broken,\" declared the Cookie Cook in a\nsorrowful voice.\n\nFor a while the Frogman walked on in silence. Then he asked:\n\n\"Why do you attach so much importance to a dishpan?\"\n\n\"It is the greatest treasure I possess,\" replied the woman. \"It belonged\nto my mother and to all my grandmothers, since the beginning of time. It\nis, I believe, the very oldest thing in all the Yip Country--or was\nwhile it was there--and,\" she added, dropping her voice to an awed\nwhisper, \"it has magic powers!\"\n\n\"In what way?\" inquired the Frogman, seeming to be surprised at this\nstatement.\n\n\"Whoever has owned that dishpan has been a good cook, for one thing. No\none else is able to make such good cookies as I have cooked, as you and\nall the Yips know. Yet, the very morning after my dishpan was stolen, I\ntried to make a batch of cookies and they burned up in the oven! I made\nanother batch that proved too tough to eat, and I was so ashamed of them\nthat I buried them in the ground. Even the third batch of cookies, which\nI brought with me in my basket, were pretty poor stuff and no better\nthan any woman could make who does not own my diamond-studded gold\ndishpan. In fact, my good Frogman, Cayke the Cookie Cook will never be\nable to cook good cookies again until her magic dishpan is restored to\nher.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said the Frogman with a sigh, \"I suppose we must manage\nto find it.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nOzma's Friends Are Perplexed\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n\n\"Really,\" said Dorothy, looking solemn, \"this is very s'prising. We\ncan't find even a shadow of Ozma anywhere in the Em'rald City; and,\nwherever she's gone, she's taken her Magic Picture with her.\"\n\nShe was standing in the courtyard of the palace with Betsy and Trot,\nwhile Scraps, the Patchwork Girl, danced around the group, her hair\nflying in the wind.\n\n\"P'raps,\" said Scraps, still dancing, \"someone has stolen Ozma.\"\n\n\"Oh, they'd never dare do that!\" exclaimed tiny Trot.\n\n\"And stolen the Magic Picture, too, so the thing can't tell where she\nis,\" added the Patchwork Girl.\n\n\"That's nonsense,\" said Dorothy. \"Why, ev'ryone loves Ozma. There isn't\na person in the Land of Oz who would steal a single thing she owns.\"\n\n\"Huh!\" replied the Patchwork Girl. \"You don't know ev'ry person in the\nLand of Oz.\"\n\n\"Why don't I?\"\n\n\"It's a big country,\" said Scraps. \"There are cracks and corners in it\nthat even Ozma doesn't know of.\"\n\n\"The Patchwork Girl's just daffy,\" declared Betsy.\n\n\"No; she's right about that,\" replied Dorothy thoughtfully. \"There are\nlots of queer people in this fairyland who never come near Ozma or the\nEm'rald City. I've seen some of 'em myself, girls; but I haven't seen\nall, of course, and there _might_ be some wicked persons left in Oz,\nyet, though I think the wicked witches have all been destroyed.\"\n\nJust then the Wooden Sawhorse dashed into the courtyard with the Wizard\nof Oz on his back.\n\n\"Have you found Ozma?\" cried the Wizard when the Sawhorse stopped beside\nthem.\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Dorothy. \"Doesn't Glinda know where she is?\"\n\n\"No. Glinda's Book of Records and all her magic instruments are gone.\nSomeone must have stolen them.\"\n\n\"Goodness me!\" exclaimed Dorothy, in alarm. \"This is the biggest steal I\never heard of. Who do you think did it, Wizard?\"\n\n\"I've no idea,\" he answered. \"But I have come to get my own bag of magic\ntools and carry them to Glinda. She is so much more powerful than I that\nshe may be able to discover the truth by means of my magic, quicker and\nbetter than I could myself.\"\n\n\"Hurry, then,\" said Dorothy, \"for we're all getting terr'bly worried.\"\n\nThe Wizard rushed away to his rooms but presently came back with a long,\nsad face.\n\n\"It's gone!\" he said.\n\n\"What's gone?\" asked Scraps.\n\n\"My black bag of magic tools. Someone must have stolen it!\"\n\nThey looked at one another in amazement.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"This thing is getting desperate,\" continued the Wizard. \"All the\nmagic that belongs to Ozma, or to Glinda, or to me, has been stolen.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose Ozma could have taken them, herself, for some purpose?\"\nasked Betsy.\n\n\"No, indeed,\" declared the Wizard. \"I suspect some enemy has stolen Ozma\nand, for fear we would follow and recapture her, has taken all our magic\naway from us.\"\n\n\"How dreadful!\" cried Dorothy. \"The idea of anyone wanting to injure our\ndear Ozma! Can't we do _any_thing to find her, Wizard?\"\n\n\"I'll ask Glinda. I must go straight back to her and tell her that my\nmagic tools have also disappeared. The good Sorceress will be greatly\nshocked, I know.\"\n\nWith this he jumped upon the back of the Sawhorse again and the quaint\nsteed, which never tired, dashed away at full speed.\n\nThe three girls were very much disturbed in mind. Even the Patchwork\nGirl was more quiet than usual and seemed to realize that a great\ncalamity had overtaken them all. Ozma was a fairy of considerable power\nand all the creatures in Oz, as well as the three mortal girls from the\noutside world, looked upon her as their protector and friend. The idea\nof their beautiful girl Ruler's being overpowered by an enemy and\ndragged from her splendid palace a captive was too astonishing for them\nto comprehend, at first. Yet what other explanation of the mystery could\nthere be?\n\n\"Ozma wouldn't go away willingly, without letting us know about it,\"\nasserted Dorothy; \"and she wouldn't steal Glinda's Great Book of\nRecords, or the Wizard's magic, 'cause she could get them any time, just\nby asking for 'em. I'm sure some wicked person has done all this.\"\n\n\"Someone in the Land of Oz?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"Of course. No one could get across the Deadly Desert, you know, and no\none but an Oz person could know about the Magic Picture and the Book of\nRecords and the Wizard's magic, or where they were kept, and so be able\nto steal the whole outfit before we could stop 'em. It _must_ be someone\nwho lives in the Land of Oz.\"\n\n\"But who--who--who?\" asked Scraps. \"That's the question. Who?\"\n\n\"If we knew,\" replied Dorothy, severely, \"we wouldn't be standing here,\ndoing nothing.\"\n\nJust then two boys entered the courtyard and approached the group of\ngirls. One boy was dressed in the fantastic Munchkin costume--a blue\njacket and knickerbockers, blue leather shoes and a blue hat with a\nhigh peak and tiny silver bells dangling from its rim--and this was Ojo\nthe Lucky, who had once come from the Munchkin Country of Oz and now\nlived in the Emerald City. The other boy was an American, from\nPhiladelphia, and had lately found his way to Oz in the company of Trot\nand Cap'n Bill. His name was Button-Bright; that is, everyone called him\nby that name, and knew no other.\n\nButton-Bright was not quite as big as the Munchkin boy, but he wore the\nsame kind of clothes, only they were of different colors. As the two\ncame up to the girls, arm in arm, Button-Bright remarked:\n\n\"Hello, Dorothy. They say Ozma is lost.\"\n\n\"_Who_ says so?\" she asked.\n\n\"Everybody's talking about it, in the City,\" he replied.\n\n\"I wonder how the people found it out?\" Dorothy asked.\n\n\"I know,\" said Ojo. \"Jellia Jamb told them. She has been asking\neverywhere if anyone has seen Ozma.\"\n\n\"That's too bad,\" observed Dorothy, frowning.\n\n\"Why?\" asked Button-Bright.\n\n\"There wasn't any use making all our people unhappy, till we were dead\ncertain that Ozma can't be found.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Pshaw,\" said Button-Bright, \"It's nothing to get lost. I've been lost\nlots of times.\"\n\n\"That's true,\" admitted Trot, who knew that the boy had a habit of\ngetting lost and then finding himself again; \"but it's diff'rent with\nOzma. She's the Ruler of all this big fairyland and we're 'fraid that\nthe reason she's lost is because somebody has stolen her away.\"\n\n\"Only wicked people steal,\" said Ojo. \"Do you know of any wicked people\nin Oz, Dorothy?\"\n\n\"No,\" she replied.\n\n\"They're here, though,\" cried Scraps, dancing up to them and then\ncircling around the group. \"Ozma's stolen; someone in Oz stole her; only\nwicked people steal; so someone in Oz is wicked!\"\n\nThere was no denying the truth of this statement. The faces of all of\nthem were now solemn and sorrowful.\n\n\"One thing is sure,\" said Button-Bright, after a time, \"if Ozma has been\nstolen, someone ought to find her and punish the thief.\"\n\n\"There may be a lot of thieves,\" suggested Trot gravely, \"and in this\nfairy country they don't seem to have any soldiers or policemen.\"\n\n\"There is one soldier,\" claimed Dorothy. \"He has green whiskers and a\ngun and is a Major-General; but no one is afraid of either his gun or\nhis whiskers, 'cause he's so tender-hearted that he wouldn't hurt a\nfly.\"\n\n\"Well, a soldier's a soldier,\" said Betsy, \"and perhaps he'd hurt a\nwicked thief if he wouldn't hurt a fly. Where is he?\"\n\n\"He went fishing about two months ago and hasn't come back yet,\"\nexplained Button-Bright.\n\n\"Then I can't see that he will be of much use to us in this trouble,\"\nsighed little Trot. \"But p'raps Ozma, who is a fairy, can get away from\nthe thieves without any help from anybody.\"\n\n\"She _might_ be able to,\" admitted Dorothy, reflectively, \"but if she\nhad the power to do that, it isn't likely she'd have let herself be\nstolen. So the thieves must have been even more powerful in magic than\nour Ozma.\"\n\nThere was no denying this argument and, although they talked the matter\nover all the rest of that day, they were unable to decide how Ozma had\nbeen stolen against her will or who had committed the dreadful deed.\n\nToward evening the Wizard came back, riding slowly upon the Sawhorse\nbecause he felt discouraged and perplexed. Glinda came, later, in her\naerial chariot drawn by twenty milk-white swans, and she also seemed\nworried and unhappy. More of Ozma's friends joined them and that evening\nthey all had a long talk together.\n\n\"I think,\" said Dorothy, \"we ought to start out right away in search of\nour dear Ozma. It seems cruel for us to live comf'tably in her palace\nwhile she is a pris'ner in the power of some wicked enemy.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed Glinda the Sorceress, \"someone ought to search for her. I\ncannot go myself, because I must work hard in order to create some new\ninstruments of sorcery by means of which I may rescue our fair Ruler.\nBut if you can find her, in the meantime, and let me know who has stolen\nher, it will enable me to rescue her much more quickly.\"\n\n\"Then we'll start to-morrow morning,\" decided Dorothy. \"Betsy and Trot\nand I won't waste another minute.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure you girls will make good detectives,\" remarked the Wizard;\n\"but I'll go with you, to protect you from harm and to give you my\nadvice. All my wizardry, alas, is stolen, so I am now really no more a\nwizard than any of you; but I will try to protect you from any enemies\nyou may meet.\"\n\n\"What harm could happen to us in Oz?\" inquired Trot.\n\n\"What harm happened to Ozma?\" returned the Wizard. \"If there is an Evil\nPower abroad in our fairyland, which is able to steal not only Ozma and\nher Magic Picture, but Glinda's Book of Records and all her magic, and\nmy black bag containing all my tricks of wizardry, then that Evil Power\nmay yet cause us considerable injury. Ozma is a fairy, and so is Glinda,\nso no power can kill or destroy them; but you girls are all mortals, and\nso are Button-Bright and I, so we must watch out for ourselves.\"\n\n\"Nothing can kill me,\" said Ojo, the Munchkin boy.\n\n\"That is true,\" replied the Sorceress, \"and I think it may be well to\ndivide the searchers into several parties, that they may cover all the\nland of Oz more quickly. So I will send Ojo and Unc Nunkie and Dr. Pipt\ninto the Munchkin Country, which they are well acquainted with; and I\nwill send the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman into the Quadling Country,\nfor they are fearless and brave and never tire; and to the Gillikin\nCountry, where many dangers lurk, I will send the Shaggy Man and his\nbrother, with Tik-Tok and Jack Pumpkinhead. Dorothy may make up her own\nparty and travel into the Winkie Country. All of you must inquire\neverywhere for Ozma and try to discover where she is =hidden=.\"\n\n[Illustration: Map of Part of the LAND OF OZ Showing the Search for the\nLOST PRINCESS]\n\nThey thought this a very wise plan and adopted it without question. In\nOzma's absence Glinda the Good was the most important person in Oz and\nall were glad to serve under her direction.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nThe Search Party\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n\nNext morning, as soon as the sun was up, Glinda flew back to her castle,\nstopping on the way to instruct the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, who\nwere at that time staying at the college of Professor H. M. Wogglebug,\nT. E., and taking a course of his Patent Educational Pills. On hearing\nof Ozma's loss they started at once for the Quadling Country to search\nfor her.\n\nAs soon as Glinda had left the Emerald City, Tik-Tok and the Shaggy Man\nand Jack Pumpkinhead, who had been present at the conference, began\ntheir journey into the Gillikin Country, and an hour later Ojo and Unc\nNunkie joined Dr. Pipt and together they traveled toward the Munchkin\nCountry. When all these searchers were gone, Dorothy and the Wizard\ncompleted their own preparations.\n\nThe Wizard hitched the Sawhorse to the Red Wagon, which would seat four\nvery comfortably. He wanted Dorothy, Betsy, Trot and the Patchwork Girl\nto ride in the wagon, but Scraps came up to them mounted upon the Woozy,\nand the Woozy said he would like to join the party. Now this Woozy was a\nmost peculiar animal, having a square head, square body, square legs and\nsquare tail. His skin was very tough and hard, resembling leather, and\nwhile his movements were somewhat clumsy the beast could travel with\nremarkable swiftness. His square eyes were mild and gentle in expression\nand he was not especially foolish. The Woozy and the Patchwork Girl were\ngreat friends and so the Wizard agreed to let the Woozy go with them.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAnother great beast now appeared and asked to go along. This was none\nother than the famous Cowardly Lion, one of the most interesting\ncreatures in all Oz. No lion that roamed the jungles or plains could\ncompare in size or intelligence with this Cowardly Lion, who--like all\nanimals living in Oz--could talk, and who talked with more shrewdness\nand wisdom than many of the people did. He said he was cowardly because\nhe always trembled when he faced danger, but he had faced danger many\ntimes and never refused to fight when it was necessary. This Lion was a\ngreat favorite with Ozma and always guarded her throne on state\noccasions. He was also an old companion and friend of the Princess\nDorothy, so the girl was delighted to have him join the party.\n\n\"I'm so nervous over our dear Ozma,\" said the Cowardly Lion in his deep,\nrumbling voice, \"that it would make me unhappy to remain behind while\nyou are trying to find her. But do not get into any danger, I beg of\nyou, for danger frightens me terribly.\"\n\n\"We'll not get into danger if we can poss'bly help it,\" promised\nDorothy; \"but we shall do anything to find Ozma, danger or no danger.\"\n\nThe addition of the Woozy and the Cowardly Lion to the party gave Betsy\nBobbin an idea and she ran to the marble stables at the rear of the\npalace and brought out her mule, Hank by name. Perhaps no mule you ever\nsaw was so lean and bony and altogether plain looking as this Hank, but\nBetsy loved him dearly because he was faithful and steady and not nearly\nso stupid as most mules are considered to be. Betsy had a saddle for\nHank and declared she would ride on his back, an arrangement approved by\nthe Wizard because it left only four of the party to ride on the seats\nof the Red Wagon--Dorothy and Button-Bright and Trot and himself.\n\nAn old sailor-man, who had one wooden leg, came to see them off and\nsuggested that they put a supply of food and blankets in the Red Wagon,\ninasmuch as they were uncertain how long they would be gone. This\nsailor-man was called Cap'n Bill. He was a former friend and comrade of\nTrot and had encountered many adventures in company with the little\ngirl. I think he was sorry he could not go with her on this trip, but\nGlinda the Sorceress had asked Cap'n Bill to remain in the Emerald City\nand take charge of the royal palace while everyone else was away, and\nthe one-legged sailor had agreed to do so.\n\nThey loaded the back end of the Red Wagon with everything they thought\nthey might need, and then they formed a procession and marched from the\npalace through the Emerald City to the great gates of the wall that\nsurrounded this beautiful capital of the Land of Oz. Crowds of citizens\nlined the streets to see them pass and to cheer them and wish them\nsuccess, for all were grieved over Ozma's loss and anxious that she be\nfound again.\n\nFirst came the Cowardly Lion; then the Patchwork Girl riding upon the\nWoozy; then Betsy Bobbin on her mule Hank; and finally the Sawhorse\ndrawing the Red Wagon, in which were seated the Wizard and Dorothy and\nButton-Bright and Trot. No one was obliged to drive the Sawhorse, so\nthere were no reins to his harness; one had only to tell him which way\nto go, fast or slow, and he understood perfectly.\n\nIt was about this time that a shaggy little black dog who had been lying\nasleep in Dorothy's room in the palace woke up and discovered he was\nlonesome. Everything seemed very still throughout the great building and\nToto--that was the little dog's name--missed the customary chatter of\nthe three girls. He never paid much attention to what was going on\naround him and, although he could speak, he seldom said anything; so the\nlittle dog did not know about Ozma's loss or that everyone had gone in\nsearch of her. But he liked to be with people, and especially with his\nown mistress, Dorothy, and having yawned and stretched himself and found\nthe door of the room ajar he trotted out into the corridor and went\ndown the stately marble stairs to the hall of the palace, where he met\nJellia Jamb.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Where's Dorothy?\" asked Toto.\n\n\"She's gone to the Winkie Country,\" answered the maid.\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"A little while ago,\" replied Jellia.\n\nToto turned and trotted out into the palace garden and down the long\ndriveway until he came to the streets of the Emerald City. Here he\npaused to listen and, hearing sounds of cheering, he ran swiftly along\nuntil he came in sight of the Red Wagon and the Woozy and the Lion and\nthe Mule and all the others. Being a wise little dog, he decided not to\nshow himself to Dorothy just then, lest he be sent back home; but he\nnever lost sight of the party of travelers, all of whom were so eager to\nget ahead that they never thought to look behind them.\n\nWhen they came to the gates in the city wall the Guardian of the Gates\ncame out to throw wide the golden portals and let them pass through.\n\n\"Did any strange person come in or out of the city on the night before\nlast, when Ozma was stolen?\" asked Dorothy.\n\n\"No, indeed, Princess,\" answered the Guardian of the Gates.\n\n\"Of course not,\" said the Wizard. \"Anyone clever enough to steal all the\nthings we have lost would not mind the barrier of a wall like this, in\nthe least. I think the thief must have flown through the air, for\notherwise he could not have stolen from Ozma's royal palace and Glinda's\nfar-away castle in the same night. Moreover, as there are no airships in\nOz and no way for airships from the outside world to get into this\ncountry, I believe the thief must have flown from place to place by\nmeans of magic arts which neither Glinda nor I understand.\"\n\nOn they went, and before the gates closed behind them Toto managed to\ndodge through them. The country surrounding the Emerald City was thickly\nsettled and for a while our friends rode over nicely paved roads which\nwound through a fertile country dotted with beautiful houses, all built\nin the quaint Oz fashion. In the course of a few hours, however, they\nhad left the tilled fields and entered the Country of the Winkies, which\noccupies a quarter of all the territory in the Land of Oz but is not so\nwell known as many other parts of Ozma's fairyland. Long before night\nthe travelers had crossed the Winkie River near to the Scarecrow's\nTower (which was now vacant) and had entered the Rolling Prairie where\nfew people live. They asked everyone they met for news of Ozma, but none\nin this district had seen her or even knew that she had been stolen. And\nby nightfall they had passed all the farmhouses and were obliged to stop\nand ask for shelter at the hut of a lonely shepherd. When they halted,\nToto was not far behind. The little dog halted, too, and stealing softly\naround the party he hid himself behind the hut.\n\nThe shepherd was a kindly old man and treated the travelers with much\ncourtesy. He slept out of doors, that night, giving up his hut to the\nthree girls, who made their beds on the floor with the blankets they had\nbrought in the Red Wagon. The Wizard and Button-Bright also slept out of\ndoors, and so did the Cowardly Lion and Hank the Mule. But Scraps and\nthe Sawhorse did not sleep at all and the Woozy could stay awake for a\nmonth at a time, if he wished to, so these three sat in a little group\nby themselves and talked together all through the night.\n\nIn the darkness the Cowardly Lion felt a shaggy little form nestling\nbeside his own, and he said sleepily:\n\n\"Where did you come from, Toto?\"\n\n\"From home,\" said the dog. \"If you roll over, roll the other way, so you\nwon't smash me.\"\n\n\"Does Dorothy know you are here?\" asked the Lion.\n\n\"I believe not,\" admitted Toto, and he added, a little anxiously: \"Do\nyou think, friend Lion, we are now far enough from the Emerald City for\nme to risk showing myself? Or will Dorothy send me back because I wasn't\ninvited?\"\n\n\"Only Dorothy can answer that question,\" said the Lion. \"For my part,\nToto, I consider this affair none of my business, so you must act as you\nthink best.\"\n\nThen the huge beast went to sleep again and Toto snuggled closer to his\nwarm, hairy body and also slept. He was a wise little dog, in his way,\nand didn't intend to worry when there was something much better to do.\n\nIn the morning the Wizard built a fire, over which the girls cooked a\nvery good breakfast.\n\nSuddenly Dorothy discovered Toto sitting quietly before the fire and the\nlittle girl exclaimed:\n\n\"Goodness me, Toto! Where did _you_ come from?\"\n\n\"From the place you cruelly left me,\" replied the dog in a reproachful\ntone.\n\n\"I forgot all about you,\" admitted Dorothy, \"and if I hadn't I'd\nprob'ly left you with Jellia Jamb, seeing this isn't a pleasure trip but\nstric'ly business. But, now that you're here, Toto, I s'pose you'll have\nto stay with us, unless you'd rather go back home again. We may get\nourselves into trouble, before we're done, Toto.\"\n\n\"Never mind that,\" said Toto, wagging his tail. \"I'm hungry, Dorothy.\"\n\n\"Breakfas'll soon be ready and then you shall have your share,\" promised\nhis little mistress, who was really glad to have her dog with her. She\nand Toto had traveled together before, and she knew he was a good and\nfaithful comrade.\n\nWhen the food was cooked and served the girls invited the old shepherd\nto join them in their morning meal. He willingly consented and while\nthey ate he said to them:\n\n\"You are now about to pass through a very dangerous country, unless you\nturn to the north or to the south to escape its perils.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said the Cowardly Lion, \"let us turn, by all means, for\nI dread to face dangers of any sort.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with the country ahead of us?\" inquired Dorothy.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Beyond this Rolling Prairie,\" explained the shepherd, \"are the\nMerry-Go-Round Mountains, set close together and surrounded by deep\ngulfs, so that no one is able to get past them. Beyond the\nMerry-Go-Round Mountains it is said the Thistle-Eaters and the Herkus\nlive.\"\n\n\"What are they like?\" demanded Dorothy.\n\n\"No one knows, for no one has ever passed the Merry-Go-Round Mountains,\"\nwas the reply; \"but it is said that the Thistle-Eaters hitch dragons to\ntheir chariots and that the Herkus are waited upon by giants whom they\nhave conquered and made their slaves.\"\n\n\"Who says all that?\" asked Betsy.\n\n\"It is common report,\" declared the shepherd. \"Everyone believes it.\"\n\n\"I don't see how they know,\" remarked little Trot, \"if no one has been\nthere.\"\n\n\"Perhaps the birds who fly over that country brought the news,\"\nsuggested Betsy.\n\n\"If you escaped those dangers,\" continued the shepherd, \"you might\nencounter others, still more serious, before you came to the next branch\nof the Winkie River. It is true that beyond that river there lies a fine\ncountry, inhabited by good people, and if you reached there you would\nhave no further trouble. It is between here and the west branch of the\nWinkie River that all dangers lie, for that is the unknown territory\nthat is inhabited by terrible, lawless people.\"\n\n\"It may be, and it may not be,\" said the Wizard. \"We shall know when we\nget there.\"\n\n\"Well,\" persisted the shepherd, \"in a fairy country such as ours every\nundiscovered place is likely to harbor wicked creatures. If they were\nnot wicked, they would discover themselves, and by coming among us\nsubmit to Ozma's rule and be good and considerate, as are all the Oz\npeople whom we know.\"\n\n\"That argument,\" stated the little Wizard, \"convinces me that it is our\nduty to go straight to those unknown places, however dangerous they may\nbe; for it is surely some cruel and wicked person who has stolen our\nOzma, and we know it would be folly to search among good people for the\nculprit. Ozma may not be hidden in the secret places of the Winkie\nCountry, it is true, but it is our duty to travel to every spot, however\ndangerous, where our beloved Ruler is likely to be imprisoned.\"\n\n\"You're right about that,\" said Button-Bright approvingly. \"Dangers\ndon't hurt us; only things that happen ever hurt anyone, and a danger is\na thing that might happen, and might not happen, and sometimes don't\namount to shucks. I vote we go ahead and take our chances.\"\n\nThey were all of the same opinion, so they packed up and said good-bye\nto the friendly shepherd and proceeded on their way.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nThe Merry-Go-Round Mountains\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\n\nThe Rolling Prairie was not difficult to travel over, although it was\nall up-hill and down-hill, so for a while they made good progress. Not\neven a shepherd was to be met with now and the farther they advanced the\nmore dreary the landscape became. At noon they stopped for a \"picnic\nluncheon,\" as Betsy called it, and then they again resumed their\njourney. All the animals were swift and tireless and even the Cowardly\nLion and the Mule found they could keep up with the pace of the Woozy\nand the Sawhorse.\n\nIt was the middle of the afternoon when first they came in sight of a\ncluster of low mountains. These were cone-shaped, rising from broad\nbases to sharp peaks at the tops. From a distance the mountains appeared\nindistinct and seemed rather small--more like hills than mountains--but\nas the travelers drew nearer they noted a most unusual circumstance: the\nhills were all whirling around, some in one direction and some the\nopposite way.\n\n\"I guess those are the Merry-Go-Round Mountains, all right,\" said\nDorothy.\n\n\"They must be,\" said the Wizard.\n\n\"They go 'round, sure enough,\" added Trot, \"but they don't seem very\nmerry.\"\n\nThere were several rows of these mountains, extending both to the right\nand to the left, for miles and miles. How many rows there might be, none\ncould tell, but between the first row of peaks could be seen other\npeaks, all steadily whirling around one way or another. Continuing to\nride nearer, our friends watched these hills attentively, until at last,\ncoming close up, they discovered there was a deep but narrow gulf around\nthe edge of each mountain, and that the mountains were set so close\ntogether that the outer gulf was continuous and barred farther advance.\n\nAt the edge of the gulf they all dismounted and peered over into its\ndepths. There was no telling where the bottom was, if indeed there was\nany bottom at all. From where they stood it seemed as if the mountains\nhad been set in one great hole in the ground, just close enough together\nso they would not touch, and that each mountain was supported by a rocky\ncolumn beneath its base which extended far down into the black pit\nbelow. From the land side it seemed impossible to get across the gulf\nor, succeeding in that, to gain a foothold on any of the whirling\nmountains.\n\n\"This ditch is too wide to jump across,\" remarked Button-Bright.\n\n\"P'raps the Lion could do it,\" suggested Dorothy.\n\n\"What, jump from here to that whirling hill?\" cried the Lion\nindignantly. \"I should say not! Even if I landed there, and could hold\non, what good would it do? There's another spinning mountain beyond it,\nand perhaps still another beyond that. I don't believe any living\ncreature could jump from one mountain to another, when both are whirling\nlike tops and in different directions.\"\n\n\"I propose we turn back,\" said the Wooden Sawhorse, with a yawn of his\nchopped-out mouth, as he stared with his knot eyes at the Merry-Go-Round\nMountains.\n\n\"I agree with you,\" said the Woozy, wagging his square head.\n\n\"We should have taken the shepherd's advice,\" added Hank the Mule.\n\nThe others of the party, however they might be puzzled by the serious\nproblem that confronted them, would not allow themselves to despair.\n\n\"If we once get over these mountains,\" said Button-Bright, \"we could\nprobably get along all right.\"\n\n\"True enough,\" agreed Dorothy. \"So we must find some way, of course, to\nget past these whirligig hills. But how?\"\n\n\"I wish the Ork was with us,\" sighed Trot.\n\n\"But the Ork isn't here,\" said the Wizard, \"and we must depend upon\nourselves to conquer this difficulty. Unfortunately, all my magic has\nbeen stolen; otherwise I am sure I could easily get over the mountains.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately,\" observed the Woozy, \"none of us has wings. And we're in\na magic country without any magic.\"\n\n\"What is that around your waist, Dorothy?\" asked the Wizard.\n\n\"That? Oh, that's just the Magic Belt I once captured from the Nome\nKing,\" she replied.\n\n\"A Magic Belt! Why, that's fine. I'm sure a Magic Belt would take you\nover these hills.\"\n\n\"It might, if I knew how to work it,\" said the little girl. \"Ozma knows\na lot of its magic, but I've never found out about it. All I know is\nthat while I am wearing it nothing can hurt me.\"\n\n\"Try wishing yourself across, and see if it will obey you,\" suggested\nthe Wizard.\n\n\"But what good would that do?\" asked Dorothy. \"If I got across it\nwouldn't help the rest of you, and I couldn't go alone among all those\ngiants and dragons, while you stayed here.\"\n\n\"True enough,\" agreed the Wizard, sadly; and then, after looking around\nthe group, he inquired: \"What is that on your finger, Trot?\"\n\n\"A ring. The Mermaids gave it to me,\" she explained, \"and if ever I'm in\ntrouble when I'm on the water I can call the Mermaids and they'll come\nand help me. But the Mermaids can't help me on the land, you know,\n'cause they swim, and--and--they haven't any legs.\"\n\n\"True enough,\" repeated the Wizard, more sadly.\n\nThere was a big, broad-spreading tree near the edge of the gulf and as\nthe sun was hot above them they all gathered under the shade of the tree\nto study the problem of what to do next.\n\n\"If we had a long rope,\" said Betsy, \"we could fasten it to this tree\nand let the other end of it down into the gulf and all slide down it.\"\n\n\"Well, what then?\" asked the Wizard.\n\n\"Then, if we could manage to throw the rope up the other side,\"\nexplained the girl, \"we could all climb it and be on the other side of\nthe gulf.\"\n\n\"There are too many 'if's' in that suggestion,\" remarked the little\nWizard. \"And you must remember that the other side is nothing but\nspinning mountains, so we couldn't possibly fasten a rope to them--even\nif we had one.\"\n\n\"That rope idea isn't half bad, though,\" said the Patchwork Girl, who\nhad been dancing dangerously near to the edge of the gulf.\n\n\"What do you mean?\" asked Dorothy.\n\nThe Patchwork Girl suddenly stood still and cast her button eyes around\nthe group.\n\n\"Ha, I have it!\" she exclaimed. \"Unharness the Sawhorse, somebody; my\nfingers are too clumsy.\"\n\n\"Shall we?\" asked Button-Bright doubtfully, turning to the others.\n\n\"Well, Scraps has a lot of brains, even if she is stuffed with cotton,\"\nasserted the Wizard. \"If her brains can help us out of this trouble we\nought to use them.\"\n\nSo he began unharnessing the Sawhorse, and Button-Bright and Dorothy\nhelped him. When they had removed the harness the Patchwork Girl told\nthem to take it all apart and buckle the straps together, end to end.\nAnd, after they had done this, they found they had one very long strap\nthat was stronger than any rope.\n\n\"It would reach across the gulf, easily,\" said the Lion, who with the\nother animals had sat on his haunches and watched this proceeding. \"But\nI don't see how it could be fastened to one of those dizzy mountains.\"\n\nScraps had no such notion as that in her baggy head. She told them to\nfasten one end of the strap to a stout limb of the tree, pointing to one\nwhich extended quite to the edge of the gulf. Button-Bright did that,\nclimbing the tree and then crawling out upon the limb until he was\nnearly over the gulf. There he managed to fasten the strap, which\nreached to the ground below, and then he slid down it and was caught\nby the Wizard, who feared he might fall into the chasm.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nScraps was delighted. She seized the lower end of the strap and telling\nthem all to get out of her way she went back as far as the strap would\nreach and then made a sudden run toward the gulf. Over the edge she\nswung, clinging to the strap until it had gone as far as its length\npermitted, when she let go and sailed gracefully through the air until\nshe alighted upon the mountain just in front of them.\n\nAlmost instantly, as the great cone continued to whirl, she was sent\nflying against the next mountain in the rear, and that one had only\nturned halfway around when Scraps was sent flying to the next mountain\nbehind it. Then her patchwork form disappeared from view entirely and\nthe amazed watchers under the tree wondered what had become of her.\n\n\"She's gone, and she can't get back,\" said the Woozy.\n\n\"My, how she bounded from one mountain to another!\" exclaimed the Lion.\n\n\"That was because they whirl so fast,\" the Wizard explained. \"Scraps had\nnothing to hold on to and so of course she was tossed from one hill to\nanother. I'm afraid we shall never see the poor Patchwork Girl again.\"\n\n\"_I_ shall see her,\" declared the Woozy. \"Scraps is an old friend of\nmine and, if there are really Thistle-Eaters and Giants on the other\nside of those tops, she will need someone to protect her. So, here I\ngo!\"\n\nHe seized the dangling strap firmly in his square mouth and in the same\nway that Scraps had done swung himself over the gulf. He let go the\nstrap at the right moment and fell upon the first whirling mountain.\nThen he bounded to the next one back of it--not on his feet but \"all\nmixed up,\" as Trot said--and then he shot across to another mountain,\ndisappearing from view just as the Patchwork Girl had done.\n\n\"It seems to work, all right,\" remarked Button-Bright. \"I guess I'll try\nit.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" urged the Wizard. \"Before any more of us make this\ndesperate leap into the beyond, we must decide whether all will go, or\nif some of us will remain behind.\"\n\n\"Do you s'pose it hurt them much, to bump against those mountains?\"\nasked Trot.\n\n\"I don't s'pose anything could hurt Scraps or the Woozy,\" said Dorothy,\n\"and nothing can hurt _me_, because I wear the Magic Belt. So, as I'm\nanxious to find Ozma, I mean to swing myself across, too.\"\n\n\"I'll take my chances,\" decided Button-Bright.\n\n\"I'm sure it will hurt dreadfully, and I'm afraid to do it,\" said the\nLion, who was already trembling; \"but I shall do it if Dorothy does.\"\n\n\"Well, that will leave Betsy and the Mule and Trot,\" said the Wizard;\n\"for of course, I shall go, that I may look after Dorothy. Do you two\ngirls think you can find your way back home again?\" he asked, addressing\nTrot and Betsy.\n\n\"I'm not afraid; not much, that is,\" said Trot. \"It looks risky, I know,\nbut I'm sure I can stand it if the others can.\"\n\n\"If it wasn't for leaving Hank,\" began Betsy, in a hesitating voice; but\nthe Mule interrupted her by saying:\n\n\"Go ahead, if you want to, and I'll come after you. A mule is as brave\nas a lion, any day.\"\n\n\"Braver,\" said the Lion, \"for I'm a coward, friend Hank, and you are\nnot. But of course the Sawhorse----\"\n\n\"Oh, nothing ever hurts _me_,\" asserted the Sawhorse calmly. \"There's\nnever been any question about _my_ going. I can't take the Red Wagon,\nthough.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"No, we must leave the wagon,\" said the Wizard; \"and also we must leave\nour food and blankets, I fear. But if we can defy these Merry-Go-Round\nMountains to stop us we won't mind the sacrifice of some of our\ncomforts.\"\n\n\"No one knows where we're going to land!\" remarked the Lion, in a voice\nthat sounded as if he were going to cry.\n\n\"We may not land at all,\" replied Hank; \"but the best way to find out\nwhat will happen to us is to swing across, as Scraps and the Woozy have\ndone.\"\n\n\"I think I shall go last,\" said the Wizard; \"so who wants to go first?\"\n\n\"I'll go,\" decided Dorothy.\n\n\"No, it's my turn first,\" said Button-Bright. \"Watch me!\"\n\nEven as he spoke the boy seized the strap and after making a run swung\nhimself across the gulf. Away he went, bumping from hill to hill until\nhe disappeared. They listened intently, but the boy uttered no cry until\nhe had been gone some moments, when they heart a faint \"Hullo-a!\" as if\ncalled from a great distance.\n\nThe sound gave them courage, however, and Dorothy picked up Toto and\nheld him fast under one arm while with the other hand she seized the\nstrap and bravely followed after Button-Bright.\n\nWhen she struck the first whirling mountain she fell upon it quite\nsoftly, but before she had time to think she flew through the air and\nlit with a jar on the side of the next mountain. Again she flew, and\nalighted; and again, and still again, until after five successive bumps\nshe fell sprawling upon a green meadow and was so dazed and bewildered\nby her bumpy journey across the Merry-Go-Round Mountains that she lay\nquite still for a time, to collect her thoughts. Toto had escaped from\nher arms just as she fell, and he now sat beside her panting with\nexcitement.\n\nThen Dorothy realized that someone was helping her to her feet, and here\nwas Button-Bright on one side of her and Scraps on the other, both\nseeming to be unhurt. The next object her eyes fell upon was the Woozy,\nsquatting upon his square back end and looking at her reflectively,\nwhile Toto barked joyously to find his mistress unhurt after her\nwhirlwind trip.\n\n\"Good!\" said the Woozy; \"here's another and a dog, both safe and sound.\nBut, my word, Dorothy, you flew some! If you could have seen yourself,\nyou'd have been absolutely astonished.\"\n\n\"They say 'Time flies,'\" laughed Button-Bright; \"but Time never made a\nquicker journey than that.\"\n\nJust then, as Dorothy turned around to look at the whirling mountains,\nshe was in time to see tiny Trot come flying from the nearest hill to\nfall upon the soft grass not a yard away from where she stood. Trot was\nso dizzy she couldn't stand, at first, but she wasn't at all hurt and\npresently Betsy came flying to them and would have bumped into the\nothers had they not retreated in time to avoid her.\n\nThen, in quick succession, came the Lion, Hank and the Sawhorse,\nbounding from mountain to mountain to fall safely upon the greensward.\nOnly the Wizard was now left behind and they waited so long for him that\nDorothy began to be worried. But suddenly he came flying from the\nnearest mountain and tumbled heels over head beside them. Then they saw\nthat he had wound two of their blankets around his body, to keep the\nbumps from hurting him, and had fastened the blankets with some of the\nspare straps from the harness of the Sawhorse.\n\n\n\n\nThe Mysterious City\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\n\nThere they sat upon the grass, their heads still swimming from their\ndizzy flights, and looked at one another in silent bewilderment. But\npresently, when assured that no one was injured, they grew more calm and\ncollected and the Lion said with a sigh of relief:\n\n\"Who would have thought those Merry-Go-Round Mountains were made of\nrubber?\"\n\n\"Are they really rubber?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"They must be,\" replied the Lion, \"for otherwise we would not have\nbounded so swiftly from one to another without getting hurt.\"\n\n\"That is all guesswork,\" declared the Wizard, unwinding the blankets\nfrom his body, \"for none of us stayed long enough on the mountains to\ndiscover what they are made of. But where are we?\"\n\n\"That's guesswork, too,\" said Scraps. \"The shepherd said the\nThistle-Eaters live this side the mountains and are waited on by\ngiants.\"\n\n\"Oh, no,\" said Dorothy; \"it's the Herkus who have giant slaves, and the\nThistle-Eaters hitch dragons to their chariots.\"\n\n\"How could they do that?\" asked the Woozy. \"Dragons have long tails,\nwhich would get in the way of the chariot wheels.\"\n\n\"And, if the Herkus have conquered the giants,\" said Trot, \"they must be\nat least twice the size of giants. P'raps the Herkus are the biggest\npeople in all the world!\"\n\n\"Perhaps they are,\" assented the Wizard, in a thoughtful tone of voice.\n\"And perhaps the shepherd didn't know what he was talking about. Let us\ntravel on toward the west and discover for ourselves what the people of\nthis country are like.\"\n\nIt seemed a pleasant enough country, and it was quite still and peaceful\nwhen they turned their eyes away from the silently whirling mountains.\nThere were trees here and there and green bushes, while throughout the\nthick grass were scattered brilliantly colored flowers. About a mile\naway was a low hill that hid from them all the country beyond it, so\nthey realized they could not tell much about the country until they had\ncrossed the hill.\n\nThe Red Wagon having been left behind, it was now necessary to make\nother arrangements for traveling. The Lion told Dorothy she could ride\nupon his back, as she had often done before, and the Woozy said he could\neasily carry both Trot and the Patchwork Girl. Betsy still had her mule,\nHank, and Button-Bright and the Wizard could sit together upon the long,\nthin back of the Sawhorse, but they took care to soften their seat with\na pad of blankets before they started. Thus mounted, the adventurers\nstarted for the hill, which was reached after a brief journey.\n\nAs they mounted the crest and gazed beyond the hill they discovered not\nfar away a walled city, from the towers and spires of which gay banners\nwere flying. It was not a very big city, indeed, but its walls were very\nhigh and thick and it appeared that the people who lived there must\nhave feared attack by a powerful enemy, else they would not have\nsurrounded their dwellings with so strong a barrier.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThere was no path leading from the mountains to the city, and this\nproved that the people seldom or never visited the whirling hills; but\nour friends found the grass soft and agreeable to travel over and with\nthe city before them they could not well lose their way. When they drew\nnearer to the walls, the breeze carried to their ears the sound of\nmusic--dim at first but growing louder as they advanced.\n\n\"That doesn't seem like a very terr'ble place,\" remarked Dorothy.\n\n\"Well, it _looks_ all right,\" replied Trot, from her seat on the Woozy,\n\"but looks can't always be trusted.\"\n\n\"My looks can,\" said Scraps. \"I _look_ patchwork, and I _am_ patchwork,\nand no one but a blind owl could ever doubt that I'm the Patchwork\nGirl.\" Saying which she turned a somersault off the Woozy and, alighting\non her feet, began wildly dancing about.\n\n\"Are owls ever blind?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"Always, in the daytime,\" said Button-Bright. \"But Scraps can see with\nher button eyes both day and night. Isn't it queer?\"\n\n\"It's queer that buttons can see at all,\" answered Trot; \"but--good\ngracious! what's become of the city?\"\n\n\"I was going to ask that myself,\" said Dorothy. \"It's gone!\"\n\nThe animals came to a sudden halt, for the city had really\ndisappeared--walls and all--and before them lay the clear, unbroken\nsweep of the country.\n\n\"Dear me!\" exclaimed the Wizard. \"This is rather disagreeable. It is\nannoying to travel almost to a place and then find it is not there.\"\n\n\"Where can it be, then?\" asked Dorothy. \"It cert'nly was there a minute\nago.\"\n\n\"I can hear the music yet,\" declared Button-Bright, and when they all\nlistened the strains of music could plainly be heard.\n\n\"Oh! there's the city--over at the left,\" called Scraps, and turning\ntheir eyes they saw the walls and towers and fluttering banners far to\nthe left of them.\n\n\"We must have lost our way,\" suggested Dorothy.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" said the Lion. \"I, and all the other animals, have been\ntramping straight toward the city ever since we first saw it.\"\n\n\"Then how does it happen--\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" interrupted the Wizard, \"we are no farther from it than we\nwere before. It is in a different direction, that's all; so let us hurry\nand get there before it again escapes us.\"\n\nSo on they went, directly toward the city, which seemed only a couple of\nmiles distant; but when they had traveled less than a mile it suddenly\ndisappeared again. Once more they paused, somewhat discouraged, but in a\nmoment the button eyes of Scraps again discovered the city, only this\ntime it was just behind them, in the direction from which they had come.\n\n\"Goodness gracious!\" cried Dorothy. \"There's surely something wrong with\nthat city. Do you s'pose it's on wheels, Wizard?\"\n\n\"It may not be a city at all,\" he replied, looking toward it with a\nspeculative gaze.\n\n\"What _could_ it be, then?\"\n\n\"Just an illusion.\"\n\n\"What's that?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"Something you think you see and don't see.\"\n\n\"I can't believe that,\" said Button-Bright. \"If we only saw it, we might\nbe mistaken, but if we can see it and hear it, too, it must be there.\"\n\n\"Where?\" asked the Patchwork Girl.\n\n\"Somewhere near us,\" he insisted.\n\n\"We will have to go back, I suppose,\" said the Woozy, with a sigh.\n\nSo back they turned and headed for the walled city until it disappeared\nagain, only to reappear at the right of them. They were constantly\ngetting nearer to it, however, so they kept their faces turned toward it\nas it flitted here and there to all points of the compass. Presently the\nLion, who was leading the procession, halted abruptly and cried out:\n\"Ouch!\"\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Dorothy.\n\n\"Ouch--ouch!\" repeated the Lion, and leaped backward so suddenly that\nDorothy nearly tumbled from his back. At the same time Hank the Mule\nyelled \"Ouch!\" almost as loudly as the Lion had done, and he also\npranced backward a few paces.\n\n\"It's the thistles,\" said Betsy. \"They prick their legs.\"\n\nHearing this, all looked down, and sure enough the ground was thick with\nthistles, which covered the plain from the point where they stood way up\nto the walls of the mysterious city. No pathways through them could be\nseen at all; here the soft grass ended and the growth of thistles began.\n\n\"They're the prickliest thistles I ever felt,\" grumbled the Lion. \"My\nlegs smart yet from their stings, though I jumped out of them as quick\nas I could.\"\n\n\"Here is a new difficulty,\" remarked the Wizard in a grieved tone. \"The\ncity has stopped hopping around, it is true; but how are we to get to\nit, over this mass of prickers?\"\n\n\"They can't hurt _me_,\" said the thick-skinned Woozy, advancing\nfearlessly and trampling among the thistles.\n\n\"Nor me,\" said the Wooden Sawhorse.\n\n\"But the Lion and the Mule cannot stand the prickers,\" asserted Dorothy,\n\"and we can't leave them behind.\"\n\n\"Must we all go back?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"Course not!\" replied Button-Bright scornfully. \"Always, when there's\ntrouble, there's a way out of it, if you can find it.\"\n\n\"I wish the Scarecrow was here,\" said Scraps, standing on her head on\nthe Woozy's square back. \"His splendid brains would soon show us how to\nconquer this field of thistles.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with _your_ brains?\" asked the boy.\n\n\"Nothing,\" she said, making a flip-flop into the thistles and dancing\namong them without feeling their sharp points. \"I could tell you in\nhalf a minute how to get over the thistles, if I wanted to.\"\n\n\"Tell us, Scraps!\" begged Dorothy.\n\n\"I don't want to wear my brains out with overwork,\" replied the\nPatchwork Girl.\n\n\"Don't you love Ozma? And don't you want to find her?\" asked Betsy\nreproachfully.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said Scraps, walking on her hands as an acrobat does at\nthe circus.\n\n\"Well, we can't find Ozma unless we get past these thistles,\" declared\nDorothy.\n\nScraps danced around them two or three times, without reply. Then she\nsaid:\n\n\"Don't look at me, you stupid folks; look at those blankets.\"\n\nThe Wizard's face brightened at once.\n\n\"Of course!\" he exclaimed. \"Why didn't we think of those blankets\nbefore?\"\n\n\"Because you haven't magic brains,\" laughed Scraps. \"Such brains as you\nhave are of the common sort that grow in your heads, like weeds in a\ngarden. I'm sorry for you people who have to be born in order to be\nalive.\"\n\nBut the Wizard was not listening to her. He quickly removed the blankets\nfrom the back of the Sawhorse and spread one of them upon the thistles,\njust next the grass. The thick cloth rendered the prickers harmless, so\nthe Wizard walked over this first blanket and spread the second one\nfarther on, in the direction of the phantom city.\n\n\"These blankets,\" said he, \"are for the Lion and the Mule to walk upon.\nThe Sawhorse and the Woozy can walk on the thistles.\"\n\nSo the Lion and the Mule walked over the first blanket and stood upon\nthe second one until the Wizard had picked up the one they had passed\nover and spread it in front of them, when they advanced to that one and\nwaited while the one behind them was again spread in front.\n\n\"This is slow work,\" said the Wizard, \"but it will get us to the city\nafter a while.\"\n\n\"The city is a good half mile away, yet,\" announced Button-Bright.\n\n\"And this is awful hard work for the Wizard,\" added Trot.\n\n\"Why couldn't the Lion ride on the Woozy's back?\" asked Dorothy. \"It's a\nbig, flat back, and the Woozy's mighty strong. Perhaps the Lion wouldn't\nfall off.\"\n\n\"You may try it, if you like,\" said the Woozy to the Lion. \"I can take\nyou to the city in a jiffy and then come back for Hank.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I'm--I'm afraid,\" said the Cowardly Lion. He was twice as big as the\nWoozy.\n\n\"Try it,\" pleaded Dorothy.\n\n\"And take a tumble among the thistles?\" asked the Lion reproachfully.\nBut when the Woozy came close to him the big beast suddenly bounded upon\nits back and managed to balance himself there, although forced to hold\nhis four legs so close together that he was in danger of toppling over.\nThe great weight of the monster Lion did not seem to affect the Woozy,\nwho called to his rider: \"Hold on tight!\" and ran swiftly over the\nthistles toward the city.\n\nThe others stood on the blankets and watched the strange sight\nanxiously. Of course the Lion couldn't \"hold on tight\" because there was\nnothing to hold to, and he swayed from side to side as if likely to fall\noff any moment. Still, he managed to stick to the Woozy's back until\nthey were close to the walls of the city, when he leaped to the ground.\nNext moment the Woozy came dashing back at full speed.\n\n\"There's a little strip of ground next the wall where there are no\nthistles,\" he told them, when he had reached the adventurers once more.\n\"Now, then, friend Hank, see if you can ride as well as the Lion did.\"\n\n\"Take the others first,\" proposed the Mule. So the Sawhorse and the\nWoozy made a couple of trips over the thistles to the city walls and\ncarried all the people in safety, Dorothy holding little Toto in her\narms. The travelers then sat in a group on a little hillock, just\noutside the wall, and looked at the great blocks of gray stone and\nwaited for the Woozy to bring Hank to them. The Mule was very awkward\nand his legs trembled so badly that more than once they thought he would\ntumble off, but finally he reached them in safety and the entire party\nwas now reunited. More than that, they had reached the city that had\neluded them for so long and in so strange a manner.\n\n\"The gates must be around the other side,\" said the Wizard. \"Let us\nfollow the curve of the wall until we reach an opening in it.\"\n\n\"Which way?\" asked Dorothy.\n\n\"We must guess at that,\" he replied. \"Suppose we go to the left? One\ndirection is as good as another.\"\n\nThey formed in marching order and went around the city wall to the left.\nIt wasn't a big city, as I have said, but to go way around it, outside\nthe high wall, was quite a walk, as they became aware. But around it our\nadventurers went, without finding any sign of a gateway or other\nopening. When they had returned to the little mound from which they had\nstarted, they dismounted from the animals and again seated themselves on\nthe grassy mound.\n\n\"It's mighty queer, isn't it?\" asked Button-Bright.\n\n\"There must be _some_ way for the people to get out and in,\" declared\nDorothy. \"Do you s'pose they have flying machines, Wizard?\"\n\n\"No,\" he replied, \"for in that case they would be flying all over the\nLand of Oz, and we know they have not done that. Flying machines are\nunknown here. I think it more likely that the people use ladders to get\nover the walls.\"\n\n\"It would be an awful climb, over that high stone wall,\" said Betsy.\n\n\"Stone, is it?\" cried Scraps, who was again dancing wildly around, for\nshe never tired and could never keep still for long.\n\n\"Course it's stone,\" answered Betsy scornfully. \"Can't you see?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Scraps, going closer, \"I can _see_ the wall, but I can't\n_feel_ it.\" And then, with her arms outstretched, she did a very queer\nthing. She walked right into the wall and disappeared.\n\n\"For goodness sake!\" cried Dorothy amazed, as indeed they all were.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nThe High Coco-Lorum of Thi\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\n\nAnd now the Patchwork Girl came dancing out of the wall again.\n\n\"Come on!\" she called. \"It isn't there. There isn't any wall at all.\"\n\n\"What! No wall?\" exclaimed the Wizard.\n\n\"Nothing like it,\" said Scraps. \"It's a make-believe. You see it, but it\nisn't. Come on into the city; we've been wasting time.\"\n\nWith this she danced into the wall again and once more disappeared.\nButton-Bright, who was rather venturesome, dashed away after her and\nalso became invisible to them. The others followed more cautiously,\nstretching out their hands to feel the wall and finding, to their\nastonishment, that they could feel nothing because nothing opposed them.\nThey walked on a few steps and found themselves in the streets of a very\nbeautiful city. Behind them they again saw the wall, grim and forbidding\nas ever; but now they knew it was merely an illusion, prepared to keep\nstrangers from entering the city.\n\nBut the wall was soon forgotten, for in front of them were a number of\nquaint people who stared at them in amazement, as if wondering where\nthey had come from. Our friends forgot their good manners, for a time,\nand returned the stares with interest, for so remarkable a people had\nnever before been discovered in all the remarkable Land of Oz.\n\nTheir heads were shaped like diamonds and their bodies like hearts. All\nthe hair they had was a little bunch at the tip top of their\ndiamond-shaped heads and their eyes were very large and round and their\nnoses and mouths very small. Their clothing was tight-fitting and of\nbrilliant colors, being handsomely embroidered in quaint designs with\ngold or silver threads; but on their feet they wore sandals, with no\nstockings whatever. The expression of their faces was pleasant enough,\nalthough they now showed surprise at the appearance of strangers so\nunlike themselves, and our friends thought they seemed quite harmless.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said the Wizard, speaking for his party, \"for\nintruding upon you uninvited, but we are traveling on important business\nand find it necessary to visit your city. Will you kindly tell us by\nwhat name your city is called?\"\n\nThey looked at one another uncertainly, each expecting some other to\nanswer. Finally a short one whose heart-shaped body was very broad\nreplied:\n\n\"We have no occasion to call our city anything. It is where we live,\nthat is all.\"\n\n\"But by what name do others call your city?\" asked the Wizard.\n\n\"We know of no others, except yourselves,\" said the man. And then he\ninquired: \"Were you born with those queer forms you have, or has some\ncruel magician transformed you to them from your natural shapes?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"These are our natural shapes,\" declared the Wizard, \"and we consider\nthem very good shapes, too.\"\n\nThe group of inhabitants was constantly being enlarged by others who\njoined it. All were evidently startled and uneasy at the arrival of\nstrangers.\n\n\"Have you a King?\" asked Dorothy, who knew it was better to speak with\nsomeone in authority. But the man shook his diamond-like head.\n\n\"What is a King?\" he asked.\n\n\"Isn't there anyone who rules over you?\" inquired the Wizard.\n\n\"No,\" was the reply, \"each of us rules himself; or, at least, tries to\ndo so. It is not an easy thing to do, as you probably know.\"\n\nThe Wizard reflected.\n\n\"If you have disputes among you,\" said he, after a little thought, \"who\nsettles them?\"\n\n\"The High Coco-Lorum,\" they answered in a chorus.\n\n\"And who is he?\"\n\n\"The judge who enforces the laws,\" said the man who had first spoken.\n\n\"Then he is the principal person here?\" continued the Wizard.\n\n\"Well, I would not say that,\" returned the man in a puzzled way. \"The\nHigh Coco-Lorum is a public servant. However, he represents the laws,\nwhich we must all obey.\"\n\n\"I think,\" said the Wizard, \"we ought to see your High Coco-Lorum and\ntalk with him. Our mission here requires us to consult one high in\nauthority, and the High Coco-Lorum ought to be high, whatever else he\nis.\"\n\nThe inhabitants seemed to consider this proposition reasonable, for they\nnodded their diamond-shaped heads in approval. So the broad one who had\nbeen their spokesman said: \"Follow me,\" and, turning, led the way along\none of the streets.\n\nThe entire party followed him, the natives falling in behind. The\ndwellings they passed were quite nicely planned and seemed comfortable\nand convenient. After leading them a few blocks their conductor stopped\nbefore a house which was neither better nor worse than the others. The\ndoorway was shaped to admit the strangely formed bodies of these people,\nbeing narrow at the top, broad in the middle and tapering at the bottom.\nThe windows were made in much the same way, giving the house a most\npeculiar appearance. When their guide opened the gate a music-box\nconcealed in the gate-post began to play, and the sound attracted the\nattention of the High Coco-Lorum, who appeared at an open window and\ninquired:\n\n\"What has happened now?\"\n\nBut in the same moment his eyes fell upon the strangers and he hastened\nto open the door and admit them--all but the animals, which were left\noutside with the throng of natives that had now gathered. For a small\ncity there seemed to be a large number of inhabitants, but they did not\ntry to enter the house and contented themselves with staring curiously\nat the strange animals. Toto followed Dorothy.\n\nOur friends entered a large room at the front of the house, where the\nHigh Coco-Lorum asked them to be seated.\n\n\"I hope your mission here is a peaceful one,\" he said, looking a little\nworried, \"for the Thists are not very good fighters and object to being\nconquered.\"\n\n\"Are your people called Thists?\" asked Dorothy.\n\n\"Yes. I thought you knew that. And we call our city Thi.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"We are Thists because we eat thistles, you know,\" continued the High\nCoco-Lorum.\n\n\"Do you really eat those prickly things?\" inquired Button-Bright\nwonderingly.\n\n\"Why not?\" replied the other. \"The sharp points of the thistles cannot\nhurt us, because all our insides are gold-lined.\"\n\n\"Gold-lined!\"\n\n\"To be sure. Our throats and stomachs are lined with solid gold, and we\nfind the thistles nourishing and good to eat. As a matter of fact, there\nis nothing else in our country that is fit for food. All around the City\nof Thi grow countless thistles, and all we need do is to go and gather\nthem. If we wanted anything else to eat we would have to plant it, and\ngrow it, and harvest it, and that would be a lot of trouble and make us\nwork, which is an occupation we detest.\"\n\n\"But, tell me, please,\" said the Wizard, \"how does it happen that your\ncity jumps around so, from one part of the country to another?\"\n\n\"The city doesn't jump; it doesn't move at all,\" declared the High\nCoco-Lorum. \"However, I will admit that the land that surrounds it has a\ntrick of turning this way or that; and so, if one is standing upon the\nplain and facing north, he is likely to find himself suddenly facing\nwest--or east--or south. But once you reach the thistle fields you are\non solid ground.\"\n\n\"Ah, I begin to understand,\" said the Wizard, nodding his head. \"But I\nhave another question to ask: How does it happen that the Thists have no\nKing to rule over them?\"\n\n\"Hush!\" whispered the High Coco-Lorum, looking uneasily around to make\nsure they were not overheard. \"In reality, I am the King, but the people\ndon't know it. They think they rule themselves, but the fact is I have\neverything my own way. No one else knows anything about our laws, and so\nI make the laws to suit myself. If any oppose me, or question my acts, I\ntell them it's the law, and that settles it. If I called myself King,\nhowever, and wore a crown and lived in royal state, the people would not\nlike me, and might do me harm. As the High Coco-Lorum of Thi, I'm\nconsidered a very agreeable person.\"\n\n\"It seems a very clever arrangement,\" said the Wizard. \"And now, as you\nare the principal person in Thi, I beg you to tell us if the Royal Ozma\nis a captive in your city.\"\n\n\"No,\" answered the diamond-headed man, \"we have no captives. No\nstrangers but yourselves are here, and we have never before heard of the\nRoyal Ozma.\"\n\n\"She rules all of Oz,\" said Dorothy, \"and so she rules your city and\nyou, because you are in the Winkie Country, which is a part of the Land\nof Oz.\"\n\n\"It may be,\" returned the High Coco-Lorum, \"for we do not study\ngeography and have never inquired whether we live in the Land of Oz or\nnot. And any Ruler who rules us from a distance, and unknown to us, is\nwelcome to the job. But what has happened to your Royal Ozma?\"\n\n\"Someone has stolen her,\" said the Wizard. \"Do you happen to have any\ntalented magician among your people--one who is especially clever, you\nknow?\"\n\n\"No, none especially clever. We do some magic, of course, but it is all\nof the ordinary kind. I do not think any of us has yet aspired to\nstealing Rulers, either by magic or otherwise.\"\n\n\"Then we've come a long way for nothing!\" exclaimed Trot regretfully.\n\n\"But we are going farther than this,\" asserted the Patchwork Girl,\nbending her stuffed body backward until her yarn hair touched the floor\nand then walking around on her hands with her feet in the air.\n\nThe High Coco-Lorum watched Scraps admiringly.\n\n\"You may go farther on, of course,\" said he, \"but I advise you not to.\nThe Herkus live back of us, beyond the thistles and the twisting lands,\nand they are not very nice people to meet, I assure you.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Are they giants?\" asked Betsy.\n\n\"They are worse than that,\" was the reply. \"They have giants for their\nslaves and they are so much stronger than giants that the poor slaves\ndare not rebel, for fear of being torn to pieces.\"\n\n\"How do you know?\" asked Scraps.\n\n\"Everyone says so,\" answered the High Coco-Lorum.\n\n\"Have you seen the Herkus yourself?\" inquired Dorothy.\n\n\"No, but what everyone says must be true; otherwise, what would be the\nuse of their saying it?\"\n\n\"We were told, before we got here, that you people hitch dragons to your\nchariots,\" said the little girl.\n\n\"So we do,\" declared the High Coco-Lorum. \"And that reminds me that I\nought to entertain you, as strangers and my guests, by taking you for a\nride around our splendid City of Thi.\"\n\nHe touched a button and a band began to play; at least, they heard the\nmusic of a band, but couldn't tell where it came from.\n\n\"That tune is the order to my charioteer to bring around my\ndragon-chariot,\" said the High Coco-Lorum. \"Every time I give an order\nit is in music, which is a much more pleasant way to address servants\nthan in cold, stern words.\"\n\n\"Does this dragon of yours bite?\" asked Button-Bright.\n\n\"Mercy, no! Do you think I'd risk the safety of my innocent people by\nusing a biting dragon to draw my chariot? I'm proud to say that my\ndragon is harmless--unless his steering-gear breaks--and he was\nmanufactured at the famous dragon-factory in this City of Thi. Here he\ncomes and you may examine him for yourselves.\"\n\nThey heard a low rumble and a shrill squeaking sound and, going out to\nthe front of the house, they saw coming around the corner a car drawn by\na gorgeous jeweled dragon, which moved its head to right and left and\nflashed its eyes like the headlights of an automobile and uttered a\ngrowling noise as it slowly moved toward them.\n\nWhen it stopped before the High Coco-Lorum's house Toto barked sharply\nat the sprawling beast, but even tiny Trot could see that the dragon was\nnot alive. Its scales were of gold and each one was set with sparkling\njewels, while it walked in such a stiff, regular manner that it could be\nnothing else than a machine. The chariot that trailed behind it was\nlikewise of gold and jewels, and when they entered it they found there\nwere no seats. Everyone was supposed to stand up while riding.\n\nThe charioteer was a little diamond-headed fellow who straddled the neck\nof the dragon and moved the levers that made it go.\n\n\"This,\" said the High Coco-Lorum, pompously, \"is a wonderful invention.\nWe are all very proud of our auto-dragons, many of which are in use by\nour wealthy inhabitants. Start the thing going, charioteer!\"\n\nThe charioteer did not move.\n\n\"You forgot to order him in music,\" suggested Dorothy.\n\n\"Ah, so I did.\" He touched a button and a music-box in the dragon's head\nbegan to play a tune. At once the little charioteer pulled over a lever\nand the dragon began to move--very slowly and groaning dismally as it\ndrew the clumsy chariot after it. Toto trotted between the wheels. The\nSawhorse, the Mule, the Lion and the Woozy followed after and had no\ntrouble in keeping up with the machine; indeed, they had to go slow to\nkeep from running into it. When the wheels turned another music-box\nconcealed somewhere under the chariot played a lively march tune which\nwas in striking contrast with the dragging movement of the strange\nvehicle and Button-Bright decided that the music he had heard when they\nfirst sighted this city was nothing else than a chariot plodding its\nweary way through the streets.\n\nAll the travelers from the Emerald City thought this ride the most\nuninteresting and dreary they had ever experienced, but the High\nCoco-Lorum seemed to think it was grand. He pointed out the different\nbuildings and parks and fountains, in much the same way that the\nconductor of an American \"sight-seeing wagon\" does, and being guests\nthey were obliged to submit to the ordeal. But they became a little\nworried when their host told them he had ordered a banquet prepared for\nthem in the City Hall.\n\n\"What are we going to eat?\" asked Button-Bright suspiciously.\n\n\"Thistles,\" was the reply; \"fine, fresh thistles, gathered this very\nday.\"\n\nScraps laughed, for she never ate anything, but Dorothy said in a\nprotesting voice:\n\n\"_Our_ insides are not lined with gold, you know.\"\n\n\"How sad!\" exclaimed the High Coco-Lorum; and then he added, as an\nafterthought: \"But we can have the thistles boiled, if you prefer.\"\n\n\"I'm 'fraid they wouldn't taste good, even then,\" said little Trot.\n\"Haven't you anything else to eat?\"\n\nThe High Coco-Lorum shook his diamond-shaped head.\n\n\"Nothing that I know of,\" said he. \"But why should we have anything\nelse, when we have so many thistles? However, if you can't eat what we\neat, don't eat anything. We shall not be offended and the banquet will\nbe just as merry and delightful.\"\n\nKnowing his companions were all hungry the Wizard said:\n\n\"I trust you will excuse us from the banquet, sir, which will be merry\nenough without us, although it is given in our honor. For, as Ozma is\nnot in your city, we must leave here at once and seek her elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Sure we must!\" agreed Dorothy, and she whispered to Betsy and Trot:\n\"I'd rather starve somewhere else than in this city, and--who knows?--we\nmay run across somebody who eats reg'lar food and will give us some.\"\n\nSo, when the ride was finished, in spite of the protests of the High\nCoco-Lorum they insisted on continuing their journey.\n\n\"It will soon be dark,\" he objected.\n\n\"We don't mind the darkness,\" replied the Wizard.\n\n\"Some wandering Herku may get you.\"\n\n\"Do you think the Herkus would hurt us?\" asked Dorothy.\n\n\"I cannot say, not having the honor of their acquaintance. But they are\nsaid to be so strong that, if they had any other place to stand upon,\nthey could lift the world.\"\n\n\"All of them together?\" asked Button-Bright wonderingly.\n\n\"Any one of them could do it,\" said the High Coco-Lorum.\n\n\"Have you heard of any magicians being among them?\" asked the Wizard,\nknowing that only a magician could have stolen Ozma in the way she had\nbeen stolen.\n\n\"I am told it is quite a magical country,\" declared the High Coco-Lorum,\n\"and magic is usually performed by magicians. But I have never heard\nthat they have any invention or sorcery to equal our wonderful\nauto-dragons.\"\n\nThey thanked him for his courtesy and, mounting their own animals, rode\nto the farther side of the city and right through the Wall of Illusion\nout into the open country.\n\n\"I'm glad we got away so easily,\" said Betsy. \"I didn't like those\nqueer-shaped people.\"\n\n\"Nor did I,\" agreed Dorothy. \"It seems dreadful to be lined with sheets\nof pure gold and have nothing to eat but thistles.\"\n\n\"They seemed happy and contented, though,\" remarked the little Wizard,\n\"and those who are contented have nothing to regret and nothing more to\nwish for.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nToto Loses Something\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\nFor a while the travelers were constantly losing their direction, for\nbeyond the thistle fields they again found themselves upon the\nturning-lands, which swung them around in such a freakish manner that\nfirst they were headed one way and then another. But by keeping the City\nof Thi constantly behind them the adventurers finally passed the\ntreacherous turning-lands and came upon a stony country where no grass\ngrew at all. There were plenty of bushes, however, and although it was\nnow almost dark the girls discovered some delicious yellow berries\ngrowing upon the bushes, one taste of which set them all to picking as\nmany as they could find. The berries relieved their pangs of hunger, for\na time, and as it now became too dark to see anything they camped where\nthey were.\n\nThe three girls lay down upon one of the blankets--all in a row--and\nthen the Wizard covered them with the other blanket and tucked them in.\nButton-Bright crawled under the shelter of some bushes and was asleep in\nhalf a minute. The Wizard sat down with his back to a big stone and\nlooked at the stars in the sky and thought gravely upon the dangerous\nadventure they had undertaken, wondering if they would ever be able to\nfind their beloved Ozma again. The animals lay in a group by themselves,\na little distance from the others.\n\n\"I've lost my growl!\" said Toto, who had been very silent and sober all\nthat day. \"What do you suppose has become of it?\"\n\n\"If you had asked me to keep track of your growl, I might be able to\ntell you,\" remarked the Lion sleepily. \"But, frankly, Toto, I supposed\nyou were taking care of it yourself.\"\n\n\"It's an awful thing to lose one's growl,\" said Toto, wagging his tail\ndisconsolately. \"What if you lost your roar, Lion? Wouldn't you feel\nterrible?\"\n\n\"My roar,\" replied the Lion, \"is the fiercest thing about me. I depend\non it to frighten my enemies so badly that they won't dare to fight me.\"\n\n\"Once,\" said the Mule, \"I lost my bray, so that I couldn't call to Betsy\nto let her know I was hungry. That was before I could talk, you know,\nfor I had not yet come into the Land of Oz, and I found it was certainly\nvery uncomfortable not to be able to make a noise.\"\n\n\"You make enough noise now,\" declared Toto. \"But none of you has\nanswered my question: Where is my growl?\"\n\n\"You may search _me_\" said the Woozy. \"I don't care for such things\nmyself.\"\n\n\"You snore terribly,\" asserted Toto.\n\n\"It may be,\" said the Woozy. \"What one does when asleep one is not\naccountable for. I wish you would wake me up, some time when I'm\nsnoring, and let me hear the sound. Then I can judge whether it is\nterrible or delightful.\"\n\n\"It isn't pleasant, I assure you,\" said the Lion, yawning.\n\n\"To me it seems wholly unnecessary,\" declared Hank the Mule.\n\n\"You ought to break yourself of the habit,\" said the Sawhorse. \"You\nnever hear me snore, because I never sleep. I don't even whinny, as\nthose puffy meat horses do. I wish that whoever stole Toto's growl had\ntaken the Mule's bray and the Lion's roar and the Woozy's snore at the\nsame time.\"\n\n\"Do you think, then, that my growl was stolen?\"\n\n\"You have never lost it before, have you?\" inquired the Sawhorse.\n\n\"Only once, when I had a sore throat from barking too long at the moon.\"\n\n\"Is your throat sore now?\" asked the Woozy.\n\n\"No,\" replied the dog.\n\n\"I can't understand,\" said Hank, \"why dogs bark at the moon. They can't\nscare the moon, and the moon doesn't pay any attention to the bark. So\nwhy do dogs do it?\"\n\n\"Were you ever a dog?\" asked Toto.\n\n\"No, indeed,\" replied Hank. \"I am thankful to say I was created a\nmule--the most beautiful of all beasts--and have always remained one.\"\n\nThe Woozy sat upon his square haunches to examine Hank with care.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Beauty,\" said he, \"must be a matter of taste. I don't say your judgment\nis bad, friend Hank, or that you are so vulgar as to be conceited. But\nif you admire big waggly ears, and a tail like a paint-brush, and hoofs\nbig enough for an elephant, and a long neck and a body so skinny that\none can count the ribs with one eye shut--if that's your idea of beauty,\nHank--then either you or I must be much mistaken.\"\n\n\"You're full of edges,\" sneered the Mule. \"If I were square, as you are,\nI suppose you'd think me lovely.\"\n\n\"Outwardly, dear Hank, I would,\" replied the Woozy. \"But to be really\nlovely one must be beautiful without and within.\"\n\nThe Mule couldn't deny this statement, so he gave a disgusted grunt and\nrolled over so that his back was toward the Woozy. But the Lion,\nregarding the two calmly with his great yellow eyes, said to the dog:\n\n\"My dear Toto, our friends have taught us a lesson in humility. If the\nWoozy and the Mule are indeed beautiful creatures, as they seem to\nthink, you and I must be decidedly ugly.\"\n\n\"Not to ourselves,\" protested Toto, who was a shrewd little dog. \"You\nand I, Lion, are fine specimens of our own races. I am a fine dog and\nyou are a fine lion. Only in point of comparison, one with another, can\nwe be properly judged, so I will leave it to the poor old Sawhorse to\ndecide which is the most beautiful animal among us all. The Sawhorse is\nwood, so he won't be prejudiced and will speak the truth.\"\n\n\"I surely will,\" responded the Sawhorse, wagging his ears, which were\nchips set in his wooden head. \"Are you all agreed to accept my\njudgment?\"\n\n\"We are!\" they declared, each one hopeful.\n\n\"Then,\" said the Sawhorse, \"I must point out to you the fact that you\nare all meat creatures, who tire unless they sleep, and starve unless\nthey eat, and suffer from thirst unless they drink. Such animals must be\nvery imperfect, and imperfect creatures cannot be beautiful. Now, _I_ am\nmade of wood.\"\n\n\"You surely have a wooden head,\" said the Mule.\n\n\"Yes, and a wooden body and wooden legs--which are as swift as the wind\nand as tireless. I've heard Dorothy say that 'handsome is as handsome\ndoes,' and I surely perform my duties in a handsome manner. Therefore,\nif you wish my honest judgment, I will confess that among us all I am\nthe most beautiful.\"\n\nThe Mule snorted and the Woozy laughed; Toto had lost his growl and\ncould only look scornfully at the Sawhorse, who stood in his place\nunmoved. But the Lion stretched himself and yawned, saying quietly:\n\n\"Were we all like the Sawhorse we would all be Sawhorses, which would be\ntoo many of the kind; were we all like Hank, we would be a herd of\nmules; if like Toto, we would be a pack of dogs; should we all become\nthe shape of the Woozy, he would no longer be remarkable for his unusual\nappearance. Finally, were you all like me, I would consider you so\ncommon that I would not care to associate with you. To be individual, my\nfriends, to be different from others, is the only way to become\ndistinguished from the common herd. Let us be glad, therefore, that we\ndiffer from one another in form and in disposition. Variety is the spice\nof life and we are various enough to enjoy one another's society; so let\nus be content.\"\n\n\"There is some truth in that speech,\" remarked Toto reflectively. \"But\nhow about my lost growl?\"\n\n\"The growl is of importance only to you,\" responded the Lion, \"so it is\nyour business to worry over the loss, not ours. If you love us, do not\ninflict your burdens on us; be unhappy all by yourself.\"\n\n\"If the same person stole my growl who stole Ozma,\" said the little dog,\n\"I hope we shall find him very soon and punish him as he deserves. He\nmust be the most cruel person in all the world, for to prevent a dog\nfrom growling when it is his nature to growl is just as wicked, in my\nopinion, as stealing all the magic in Oz.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nButton-Bright Loses Himself\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\n\nThe Patchwork Girl, who never slept and who could see very well in the\ndark, had wandered among the rocks and bushes all night long, with the\nresult that she was able to tell some good news the next morning.\n\n\"Over the crest of the hill before us,\" she said, \"is a big grove of\ntrees of many kinds, on which all sorts of fruits grow. If you will go\nthere you will find a nice breakfast awaiting you.\"\n\nThis made them eager to start, so as soon as the blankets were folded\nand strapped to the back of the Sawhorse they all took their places on\nthe animals and set out for the big grove Scraps had told them of.\n\nAs soon as they got over the brow of the hill they discovered it to be a\nreally immense orchard, extending for miles to the right and left of\nthem. As their way led straight through the trees they hurried forward\nas fast as possible.\n\nThe first trees they came to bore quinces, which they did not like. Then\nthere were rows of citron trees and then crab apples and afterward limes\nand lemons. But beyond these they found a grove of big golden oranges,\njuicy and sweet, and the fruit hung low on the branches, so they could\npluck it easily.\n\nThey helped themselves freely and all ate oranges as they continued on\ntheir way. Then, a little farther along, they came to some trees bearing\nfine red apples, which they also feasted on, and the Wizard stopped here\nlong enough to tie a lot of the apples in one end of a blanket.\n\n\"We do not know what will happen to us after we leave this delightful\norchard,\" he said, \"so I think it wise to carry a supply of apples with\nus. We can't starve as long as we have apples, you know.\"\n\nScraps wasn't riding the Woozy just now. She loved to climb the trees\nand swing herself by the branches from one tree to another. Some of the\nchoicest fruit was gathered by the Patchwork Girl from the very highest\nlimbs and tossed down to the others.\n\nSuddenly Trot asked: \"Where's Button-Bright?\" and when the others looked\nfor him they found the boy had disappeared.\n\n\"Dear me!\" cried Dorothy. \"I guess he's lost again, and that will mean\nour waiting here until we can find him.\"\n\n\"It's a good place to wait,\" suggested Betsy, who had found a plum tree\nand was eating some of its fruit.\n\n\"How can you wait here, and find Button-Bright, at one and the same\ntime?\" inquired the Patchwork Girl, hanging by her toes on a limb just\nover the heads of the three mortal girls.\n\n\"Perhaps he'll come back here,\" answered Dorothy.\n\n\"If he tries that, he'll prob'ly lose his way,\" said Trot. \"I've known\nhim to do that, lots of times. It's losing his way that gets him lost.\"\n\n\"Very true,\" said the Wizard. \"So all the rest of you must stay here\nwhile I go look for the boy.\"\n\n\"Won't _you_ get lost, too?\" asked Betsy.\n\n\"I hope not, my dear.\"\n\n\"Let _me_ go,\" said Scraps, dropping lightly to the ground. \"I can't get\nlost, and I'm more likely to find Button-Bright than any of you.\"\n\nWithout waiting for permission she darted away through the trees and\nsoon disappeared from their view.\n\n\"Dorothy,\" said Toto, squatting beside his little mistress, \"I've lost\nmy growl.\"\n\n\"How did that happen?\" she asked.\n\n\"I don't know,\" replied Toto. \"Yesterday morning the Woozy nearly\nstepped on me and I tried to growl at him and found I couldn't growl a\nbit.\"\n\n\"Can you bark?\" inquired Dorothy.\n\n\"Oh, yes, indeed!\"\n\n\"Then never mind the growl,\" said she.\n\n\"But what will I do when I get home to the Glass Cat and the Pink\nKitten?\" asked the little dog in an anxious voice.\n\n\"They won't mind, if you can't growl at them, I'm sure,\" said Dorothy.\n\"I'm sorry for you, of course, Toto, for it's just those things we can't\ndo that we want to do most of all; but before we get back you may find\nyour growl again.\"\n\n\"Do you think the person who stole Ozma stole my growl?\"\n\nDorothy smiled.\n\n\"Perhaps, Toto.\"\n\n\"Then he's a scoundrel!\" cried the little dog.\n\n\"Anyone who would steal Ozma is as bad as bad can be,\" agreed Dorothy,\n\"and when we remember that our dear friend, the lovely Ruler of Oz, is\nlost, we ought not to worry over just a growl.\"\n\nToto was not entirely satisfied with this remark, for the more he\nthought upon his lost growl the more important his misfortune became.\nWhen no one was looking he went away among the trees and tried his best\nto growl--even a little bit--but could not manage to do so. All he could\ndo was bark, and a bark cannot take the place of a growl, so he sadly\nreturned to the others.\n\nNow, Button-Bright had no idea that he was lost, at first. He had merely\nwandered from tree to tree, seeking the finest fruit, until he\ndiscovered he was alone in the great orchard. But that didn't worry him\njust then and seeing some apricot trees farther on he went to them; then\nhe discovered some cherry trees; just beyond these were some tangerines.\n\n\"We've found 'most ev'ry kind of fruit but peaches,\" he said to\nhimself, \"so I guess there are peaches here, too, if I can find the\ntrees.\"\n\nHe searched here and there, paying no attention to his way, until he\nfound that the trees surrounding him bore only nuts. He put some walnuts\nin his pockets and kept on searching and at last--right among the nut\ntrees--he came upon one solitary peach tree. It was a graceful,\nbeautiful tree, but although it was thickly leaved it bore no fruit\nexcept one large, splendid peach, rosy-cheeked and fuzzy and just right\nto eat.\n\nButton-Bright had some trouble getting that lonesome peach, for it hung\nfar out of reach; but he climbed the tree nimbly and crept out on the\nbranch on which it grew and after several trials, during which he was in\ndanger of falling, he finally managed to pick it. Then he got back to\nthe ground and decided the fruit was well worth his trouble. It was\ndelightfully fragrant and when he bit into it he found it the most\ndelicious morsel he had ever tasted.\n\n\"I really ought to divide it with Trot and Dorothy and Betsy,\" he said;\n\"but p'rhaps there are plenty more in some other part of the orchard.\"\n\nIn his heart he doubted this statement, for this was a solitary peach\ntree, while all the other fruits grew upon many trees set close to one\nanother; but that one luscious bite made him unable to resist eating the\nrest of it and soon the peach was all gone except the pit.\n\nButton-Bright was about to throw this peach-pit away when he noticed\nthat it was of pure gold. Of course this surprised him, but so many\nthings in the Land of Oz were surprising that he did not give much\nthought to the golden peach-pit. He put it in his pocket, however, to\nshow to the girls, and five minutes afterward had forgotten all about\nit.\n\nFor now he realized that he was far separated from his companions, and\nknowing that this would worry them and delay their journey, he began to\nshout as loud as he could. His voice did not penetrate very far among\nall those trees, and after shouting a dozen times and getting no answer\nhe sat down on the ground and said:\n\n\"Well, I'm lost again. It's too bad, but I don't see how it can be\nhelped.\"\n\nAs he leaned his back against a tree he looked up and saw a Bluefinch\nfly down from the sky and alight upon a branch just before him. The bird\nlooked and looked at him. First it looked with one bright eye and then\nturned its head and looked at him with the other eye. Then,\nfluttering its wings a little, it said:\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Oho! so you've eaten the enchanted peach, have you?\"\n\n\"Was it enchanted?\" asked Button-Bright.\n\n\"Of course,\" replied the Bluefinch. \"Ugu the Shoemaker did that.\"\n\n\"But why? And how was it enchanted? And what will happen to one who eats\nit?\" questioned the boy.\n\n\"Ask Ugu the Shoemaker; he knows,\" said the bird, pruning its feathers\nwith its bill.\n\n\"And who is Ugu the Shoemaker?\"\n\n\"The one who enchanted the peach, and placed it here--in the exact\ncenter of the Great Orchard--so no one would ever find it. We birds\ndidn't dare to eat it; we are too wise for that. But you are\nButton-Bright, from the Emerald City, and you--_you_--YOU ate the\nenchanted peach! You must explain to Ugu the Shoemaker why you did\nthat.\"\n\nAnd then, before the boy could ask any more questions, the bird flew\naway and left him alone.\n\nButton-Bright was not much worried to find that the peach he had eaten\nwas enchanted. It certainly had tasted very good and his stomach didn't\nache a bit. So again he began to reflect upon the best way to rejoin his\nfriends.\n\n\"Whichever direction I follow is likely to be the wrong one,\" he said to\nhimself, \"so I'd better stay just where I am and let _them_ find\n_me_--if they can.\"\n\nA White Rabbit came hopping through the orchard and paused a little way\noff to look at him.\n\n\"Don't be afraid,\" said Button-Bright; \"I won't hurt you.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'm not afraid for myself,\" returned the White Rabbit. \"It's you\nI'm worried about.\"\n\n\"Yes; I'm lost,\" said the boy.\n\n\"I fear you are, indeed,\" answered the Rabbit. \"Why on earth did you eat\nthe enchanted peach?\"\n\nThe boy looked at the excited little animal thoughtfully.\n\n\"There were two reasons,\" he explained. \"One reason was that I like\npeaches, and the other reason was that I didn't know it was enchanted.\"\n\n\"That won't save you from Ugu the Shoemaker,\" declared the White Rabbit\nand it scurried away before the boy could ask any more questions.\n\n\"Rabbits and birds,\" he thought, \"are timid creatures and seem afraid of\nthis shoemaker--whoever he may be. If there was another peach half as\ngood as that other, I'd eat it in spite of a dozen enchantments or a\nhundred shoemakers!\"\n\nJust then Scraps came dancing along and saw him sitting at the foot of\nthe tree.\n\n\"Oh, here you are!\" she said. \"Up to your old tricks, eh? Don't you know\nit's impolite to get lost and keep everybody waiting for you? Come\nalong, and I'll lead you back to Dorothy and the others.\"\n\nButton-Bright rose slowly to accompany her.\n\n\"That wasn't much of a loss,\" he said cheerfully. \"I haven't been gone\nhalf a day, so there's no harm done.\"\n\nDorothy, however, when the boy rejoined the party, gave him a good\nscolding.\n\n\"When we're doing such an important thing as searching for Ozma,\" said\nshe, \"it's naughty for you to wander away and keep us from getting on.\nS'pose she's a pris'ner--in a dungeon cell!--do you want to keep our\ndear Ozma there any longer than we can help?\"\n\n\"If she's in a dungeon cell, how are you going to get her out?\" inquired\nthe boy.\n\n\"Never you mind; we'll leave that to the Wizard; he's sure to find a\nway.\"\n\nThe Wizard said nothing, for he realized that without his magic tools he\ncould do no more than any other person. But there was no use reminding\nhis companions of that fact; it might discourage them.\n\n\"The important thing just now,\" he remarked, \"is to find Ozma; and, as\nour party is again happily reunited, I propose we move on.\"\n\nAs they came to the edge of the Great Orchard the sun was setting and\nthey knew it would soon be dark. So it was decided to camp under the\ntrees, as another broad plain was before them. The Wizard spread the\nblankets on a bed of soft leaves and presently all of them except Scraps\nand the Sawhorse were fast asleep. Toto snuggled close to his friend the\nLion, and the Woozy snored so loudly that the Patchwork Girl covered his\nsquare head with her apron to deaden the sound.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nThe Czarover of Herku\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\n\nTrot wakened just as the sun rose and, slipping out of the blankets,\nwent to the edge of the Great Orchard and looked across the plain.\nSomething glittered in the far distance.\n\n\"That looks like another city,\" she said half aloud.\n\n\"And another city it is,\" declared Scraps, who had crept to Trot's side\nunheard, for her stuffed feet made no sound. \"The Sawhorse and I made a\njourney in the dark, while you were all asleep, and we found over there\na bigger city than Thi. There's a wall around it, too, but it has gates\nand plenty of pathways.\"\n\n\"Did you go in?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"No, for the gates were locked and the wall was a real wall. So we came\nback here again. It isn't far to the city. We can reach it in two hours\nafter you've had your breakfasts.\"\n\nTrot went back and, finding the other girls now awake, told them what\nScraps had said. So they hurriedly ate some fruit--there were plenty of\nplums and fijoas in this part of the orchard--and then they mounted the\nanimals and set out upon the journey to the strange city. Hank the Mule\nhad breakfasted on grass and the Lion had stolen away and found a\nbreakfast to his liking; he never told what it was, but Dorothy hoped\nthe little rabbits and the field mice had kept out of his way. She\nwarned Toto not to chase birds and gave the dog some apple, with which\nhe was quite content. The Woozy was as fond of fruit as of any other\nfood, except honey, and the Sawhorse never ate at all.\n\nExcept for their worry over Ozma they were all in good spirits as they\nproceeded swiftly over the plain. Toto still worried over his lost\ngrowl, but like a wise little dog kept his worry to himself. Before long\nthe city grew nearer and they could examine it with interest.\n\nIn outward appearance the place was more imposing than Thi, and it was a\nsquare city, with a square, four-sided wall around it and on each side\nwas a square gate of burnished copper. Everything about the city looked\nsolid and substantial; there were no banners flying and the towers that\nrose above the city wall seemed bare of any ornament whatever.\n\nA path led from the fruit orchard directly to one of the city gates,\nshowing that the inhabitants preferred fruit to thistles. Our friends\nfollowed this path to the gate, which they found fast shut. But the\nWizard advanced and pounded upon it with his fist, saying in a loud\nvoice: \"Open!\"\n\nAt once there rose above the great wall a row of immense heads, all of\nwhich looked down at them as if to see who was intruding. The size of\nthese heads was astonishing and our friends at once realized that they\nbelonged to giants, who were standing within the city. All had thick,\nbushy hair and whiskers, on some the hair being white and on others\nblack or red or yellow, while the hair of a few was just turning gray,\nshowing that the giants were of all ages. However fierce the heads might\nseem the eyes were mild in expression, as if the creatures had been long\nsubdued, and their faces expressed patience rather than ferocity.\n\n\"What's wanted?\" asked one old giant, in a low, grumbling voice.\n\n\"We are strangers and we wish to enter the city,\" replied the Wizard.\n\n\"Do you come in war or peace?\" asked another.\n\n\"In peace, of course,\" retorted the Wizard, and he added impatiently:\n\"Do we look like an army of conquest?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the first giant who had spoken, \"you look like innocent\ntramps; but one never can tell by appearances. Wait here until we report\nto our masters. No one can enter here without the permission of Vig, the\nCzarover.\"\n\n\"Who's that?\" inquired Dorothy. But the heads had all bobbed down and\ndisappeared behind the wall, so there was no answer.\n\nThey waited a long time before the gate rolled back with a rumbling\nsound and a loud voice cried: \"Enter!\" But they lost no time in taking\nadvantage of the invitation.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nOn either side of the broad street that led into the city from the gate\nstood a row of huge giants--twenty of them on a side and all standing so\nclose together that their elbows touched. They wore uniforms of blue and\nyellow and were armed with clubs as big around as tree-trunks. Each\ngiant had around his neck a broad band of gold, riveted on, to show he\nwas a slave.\n\nAs our friends entered, riding upon the Lion, the Woozy, the Sawhorse\nand the Mule, the giants half turned and walked in two files on either\nside of them, as if escorting them on their way. It looked to Dorothy as\nif all her party had been made prisoners, for even mounted on their\nanimals their heads scarcely reached to the knees of the marching\ngiants. The girls and Button-Bright were anxious to know what sort of a\ncity they had entered, and what the people were like who had made these\npowerful creatures their slaves. Through the legs of the giants, as they\nwalked, Dorothy could see rows of houses on each side the street and\nthrongs of people standing on the sidewalks; but the people were of\nordinary size and the only remarkable thing about them was the fact that\nthey were dreadfully lean and thin. Between their skin and their bones\nthere seemed to be little or no flesh, and they were mostly\nstoop-shouldered and weary looking, even to the little children.\n\nMore and more Dorothy wondered how and why the great giants had ever\nsubmitted to become slaves of such skinny, languid masters, but there\nwas no chance to question anyone until they arrived at a big palace\nlocated in the heart of the city. Here the giants formed lines to the\nentrance and stood still while our friends rode into the courtyard of\nthe palace. Then the gates closed behind them and before them was a\nskinny little man who bowed low and said in a sad voice:\n\n\"If you will be so obliging as to dismount, it will give me pleasure to\nlead you into the presence of the World's Most Mighty Ruler, Vig the\nCzarover.\"\n\n\"I don't believe it!\" said Dorothy indignantly.\n\n\"What don't you believe?\" asked the man.\n\n\"I don't believe your Czarover can hold a candle to our Ozma.\"\n\n\"He wouldn't hold a candle under any circumstances, or to any living\nperson,\" replied the man very seriously, \"for he has slaves to do such\nthings and the Mighty Vig is too dignified to do anything that others\ncan do for him. He even obliges a slave to sneeze for him, if ever he\ncatches cold. However, if you dare to face our powerful ruler, follow\nme.\"\n\n\"We dare anything,\" said the Wizard, \"so go ahead.\"\n\nThrough several marble corridors having lofty ceilings they passed,\nfinding each corridor and doorway guarded by servants; but these\nservants of the palace were of the people and not giants, and they were\nso thin that they almost resembled skeletons. Finally they entered a\ngreat circular room with a high domed ceiling where the Czarover sat on\na throne cut from a solid block of white marble and decorated with\npurple silk hangings and gold tassels.\n\nThe ruler of these people was combing his eyebrows when our friends\nentered his throne-room and stood before him, but he put the comb in his\npocket and examined the strangers with evident curiosity. Then he said:\n\n\"Dear me, what a surprise! You have really shocked me. For no outsider\nhas ever before come to our City of Herku, and I cannot imagine why\n_you_ have ventured to do so.\"\n\n\"We are looking for Ozma, the Supreme Ruler of the Land of Oz,\" replied\nthe Wizard.\n\n\"Do you see her anywhere around here?\" asked the Czarover.\n\n\"Not yet, Your Majesty; but perhaps you may tell us where she is.\"\n\n\"No; I have my hands full keeping track of my own people. I find them\nhard to manage because they are so tremendously strong.\"\n\n\"They don't look very strong,\" said Dorothy. \"It seems as if a good wind\nwould blow 'em way out of the city, if it wasn't for the wall.\"\n\n\"Just so--just so,\" admitted the Czarover. \"They really look that way,\ndon't they? But you must never trust to appearances, which have a way of\nfooling one. Perhaps you noticed that I prevented you from meeting any\nof my people. I protected you with my giants while you were on the way\nfrom the gates to my palace, so that not a Herku got near you.\"\n\n\"Are your people so dangerous, then?\" asked the Wizard.\n\n\"To strangers, yes; but only because they are so friendly. For, if they\nshake hands with you, they are likely to break your arms or crush your\nfingers to a jelly.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Button-Bright.\n\n\"Because we are the strongest people in all the world.\"\n\n\"Pshaw!\" exclaimed the boy, \"that's bragging. You prob'ly don't know\nhow strong other people are. Why, once I knew a man in Philadelphi' who\ncould bend iron bars with just his hands!\"\n\n\"But--mercy me!--it's no trick to bend iron bars,\" said His Majesty.\n\"Tell me, could this man crush a block of stone with his bare hands?\"\n\n\"No one could do that,\" declared the boy.\n\n\"If I had a block of stone I'd show you,\" said the Czarover, looking\naround the room. \"Ah, here is my throne. The back is too high, anyhow,\nso I'll just break off a piece of that.\"\n\nHe rose to his feet and tottered in an uncertain way around the throne.\nThen he took hold of the back and broke off a piece of marble over a\nfoot thick.\n\n\"This,\" said he, coming back to his seat, \"is very solid marble and much\nharder than ordinary stone. Yet I can crumble it easily with my\nfingers--a proof that I am very strong.\"\n\nEven as he spoke he began breaking off chunks of marble and crumbling\nthem as one would a bit of earth. The Wizard was so astonished that he\ntook a piece in his own hands and tested it, finding it very hard\nindeed.\n\nJust then one of the giant servants entered and exclaimed:\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Oh, Your Majesty, the cook has burned the soup! What shall we do?\"\n\n\"How dare you interrupt me?\" asked the Czarover, and grasping the\nimmense giant by one of his legs he raised him in the air and threw him\nheadfirst out of an open window.\n\n\"Now, tell me,\" he said, turning to Button-Bright, \"could your man in\nPhiladelphia crumble marble in his fingers?\"\n\n\"I guess not,\" said Button-Bright, much impressed by the skinny\nmonarch's strength.\n\n\"What makes you so strong?\" inquired Dorothy.\n\n\"It's the zosozo,\" he explained, \"which is an invention of my own. I and\nall my people eat zosozo, and it gives us tremendous strength. Would you\nlike to eat some?\"\n\n\"No, thank you,\" replied the girl. \"I--I don't want to get so thin.\"\n\n\"Well, of course one can't have strength and flesh at the same time,\"\nsaid the Czarover. \"Zosozo is pure energy, and it's the only compound of\nits sort in existence. I never allow our giants to have it, you know, or\nthey would soon become our masters, since they are bigger than we; so I\nkeep all the stuff locked up in my private laboratory. Once a year I\nfeed a teaspoonful of it to each of my people--men, women and\nchildren--so every one of them is nearly as strong as I am. Wouldn't\n_you_ like a dose, sir?\" he asked, turning to the Wizard.\n\n\"Well,\" said the Wizard, \"if you would give me a little zosozo in a\nbottle, I'd like to take it with me on my travels. It might come handy,\non occasion.\"\n\n\"To be sure. I'll give you enough for six doses,\" promised the Czarover.\n\"But don't take more than a teaspoonful at a time. Once Ugu the\nShoemaker took two teaspoonsful, and it made him so strong that when he\nleaned against the city wall he pushed it over, and we had to build it\nup again.\"\n\n\"Who is Ugu the Shoemaker?\" asked Button-Bright curiously, for he now\nremembered that the bird and the rabbit had claimed Ugu the Shoemaker\nhad enchanted the peach he had eaten.\n\n\"Why, Ugu is a great magician, who used to live here. But he's gone\naway, now,\" replied the Czarover.\n\n\"Where has he gone?\" asked the Wizard quickly.\n\n\"I am told he lives in a wickerwork castle in the mountains to the west\nof here. You see, Ugu became such a powerful magician that he didn't\ncare to live in our city any longer, for fear we would discover some of\nhis secrets. So he went to the mountains and built him a splendid\nwicker castle, which is so strong that even I and my people could not\nbatter it down, and there he lives all by himself.\"\n\n\"This is good news,\" declared the Wizard, \"for I think this is just the\nmagician we are searching for. But why is he called Ugu the Shoemaker?\"\n\n\"Once he was a very common citizen here and made shoes for a living,\"\nreplied the monarch of Herku. \"But he was descended from the greatest\nwizard and sorcerer who has ever lived--in this or in any other\ncountry--and one day Ugu the Shoemaker discovered all the magical books\nand recipes of his famous great-grandfather, which had been hidden away\nin the attic of his house. So he began to study the papers and books and\nto practice magic, and in time he became so skillful that, as I said, he\nscorned our city and built a solitary castle for himself.\"\n\n\"Do you think,\" asked Dorothy anxiously, \"that Ugu the Shoemaker would\nbe wicked enough to steal our Ozma of Oz?\"\n\n\"And the Magic Picture?\" asked Trot.\n\n\"And the Great Book of Records of Glinda the Good?\" asked Betsy.\n\n\"And my own magic tools?\" asked the Wizard.\n\n\"Well,\" replied the Czarover, \"I won't say that Ugu is wicked, exactly,\nbut he is very ambitious to become the most powerful magician in the\nworld, and so I suppose he would not be too proud to steal any magic\nthings that belonged to anybody else--if he could manage to do so.\"\n\n\"But how about Ozma? Why would he wish to steal _her_?\" questioned\nDorothy.\n\n\"Don't ask me, my dear. Ugu doesn't tell me why he does things, I assure\nyou.\"\n\n\"Then we must go and ask him ourselves,\" declared the little girl.\n\n\"I wouldn't do that, if I were you,\" advised the Czarover, looking first\nat the three girls and then at the boy and the little Wizard and finally\nat the stuffed Patchwork Girl. \"If Ugu has really stolen your Ozma, he\nwill probably keep her a prisoner, in spite of all your threats or\nentreaties. And, with all his magical knowledge, he would be a dangerous\nperson to attack. Therefore, if you are wise, you will go home again and\nfind a new Ruler for the Emerald City and the Land of Oz. But perhaps it\nisn't Ugu the Shoemaker who has stolen your Ozma.\"\n\n\"The only way to settle that question,\" replied the Wizard, \"is to go to\nUgu's castle and see if Ozma is there. If she is, we will report the\nmatter to the great Sorceress, Glinda the Good, and I'm pretty sure she\nwill find a way to rescue our darling ruler from the Shoemaker.\"\n\n\"Well, do as you please,\" said the Czarover. \"But, if you are all\ntransformed into hummingbirds or caterpillars, don't blame me for not\nwarning you.\"\n\nThey stayed the rest of that day in the City of Herku and were fed at\nthe royal table of the Czarover and given sleeping rooms in his palace.\nThe strong monarch treated them very nicely and gave the Wizard a little\ngolden vial of zosozo, to use if ever he or any of his party wished to\nacquire great strength.\n\nEven at the last the Czarover tried to persuade them not to go near Ugu\nthe Shoemaker, but they were resolved on the venture and the next\nmorning bade the friendly monarch a cordial good-bye and, mounting upon\ntheir animals, left the Herkus and the City of Herku and headed for the\nmountains that lay to the west.\n\n\n\n\nThe Truth Pond\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\n\nIt seems a long time since we have heard anything of the Frogman and\nCayke the Cookie Cook, who had left the Yip Country in search of the\ndiamond-studded gold dishpan which had been mysteriously stolen the same\nnight that Ozma had disappeared from the Emerald City. But you must\nremember that while the Frogman and the Cookie Cook were preparing to\ndescend from their mountain-top, and even while on their way to the\nfarmhouse of Wiljon the Winkie, Dorothy and the Wizard and their friends\nwere encountering the adventures we have just related.\n\nSo it was that on the very morning when the travelers from the Emerald\nCity bade farewell to the Czarover of the City of Herku, Cayke and the\nFrogman awoke in a grove in which they had passed the night sleeping on\nbeds of leaves. There were plenty of farmhouses in the neighborhood, but\nno one seemed to welcome the puffy, haughty Frogman or the little\ndried-up Cookie Cook, and so they slept comfortably enough underneath\nthe trees of the grove.\n\nThe Frogman wakened first, on this morning, and after going to the tree\nwhere Cayke slept and finding her still wrapt in slumber, he decided to\ntake a little walk and seek some breakfast. Coming to the edge of the\ngrove he observed, half a mile away, a pretty yellow house that was\nsurrounded by a yellow picket fence, so he walked toward this house and\non entering the yard found a Winkie woman picking up sticks with which\nto build a fire to cook her morning meal.\n\n\"For goodness sakes!\" she exclaimed on seeing the Frogman, \"what are you\ndoing out of your frog-pond?\"\n\n\"I am traveling in search of a jeweled gold dishpan, my good woman,\" he\nreplied, with an air of great dignity.\n\n\"You won't find it here, then,\" said she. \"Our dishpans are tin, and\nthey're good enough for anybody. So go back to your pond and leave me\nalone.\"\n\nShe spoke rather crossly and with a lack of respect that greatly annoyed\nthe Frogman.\n\n\"Allow me to tell you, madam,\" he said, \"that although I am a frog I am\nthe Greatest and Wisest Frog in all the world. I may add that I possess\nmuch more wisdom than any Winkie--man or woman--in this land. Wherever I\ngo, people fall on their knees before me and render homage to the Great\nFrogman! No one else knows so much as I; no one else is so grand--so\nmagnificent!\"\n\n\"If you know so much,\" she retorted, \"why don't you know where your\ndishpan is, instead of chasing around the country after it?\"\n\n\"Presently,\" he answered, \"I am going where it is; but just now I am\ntraveling and have had no breakfast. Therefore I honor you by asking you\nfor something to eat.\"\n\n\"Oho! the Great Frogman is hungry as any tramp, is he? Then pick up\nthese sticks and help me to build the fire,\" said the woman\ncontemptuously.\n\n\"Me! The Great Frogman pick up sticks?\" he exclaimed in horror. \"In the\nYip Country, where I am more honored and powerful than any King could\nbe, people weep with joy when I ask them to feed me.\"\n\n\"Then that's the place to go for your breakfast,\" declared the woman.\n\n\"I fear you do not realize my importance,\" urged the Frogman. \"Exceeding\nwisdom renders me superior to menial duties.\"\n\n\"It's a great wonder to me,\" remarked the woman, carrying her sticks to\nthe house, \"that your wisdom doesn't inform you that you'll get no\nbreakfast here,\" and she went in and slammed the door behind her.\n\nThe Frogman felt he had been insulted, so he gave a loud croak of\nindignation and turned away. After going a short distance he came upon a\nfaint path which led across a meadow in the direction of a grove of\npretty trees, and thinking this circle of evergreens must surround a\nhouse--where perhaps he would be kindly received--he decided to follow\nthe path. And by and by he came to the trees, which were set close\ntogether, and pushing aside some branches he found no house inside the\ncircle, but instead a very beautiful pond of clear water.\n\nNow the Frogman, although he was so big and so well educated and now\naped the ways and customs of human beings, was still a frog. As he gazed\nat this solitary, deserted pond, his love for water returned to him with\nirresistible force.\n\n\"If I cannot get a breakfast I may at least have a fine swim,\" said he,\nand pushing his way between the trees he reached the bank. There he took\noff his fine clothing, laying his shiny purple hat and his gold-headed\ncane beside it. A moment later he sprang with one leap into the water\nand dived to the very bottom of the pond.\n\nThe water was deliciously cool and grateful to his thick, rough skin,\nand the Frogman swam around the pond several times before he stopped to\nrest. Then he floated upon the surface and examined the pond with some\ncuriosity. The bottom and sides were all lined with glossy tiles of a\nlight pink color; just one place in the bottom, where the water bubbled\nup from a hidden spring, had been left free. On the banks the green\ngrass grew to the edge of the pink tiling.\n\nAnd now, as the Frogman examined the place, he found that on one side\nthe pool, just above the water line, had been set a golden plate on\nwhich some words were deeply engraved. He swam toward this plate and on\nreaching it read the following inscription:\n\n_This is_\nTHE TRUTH POND\n_Whoever bathes in this\nwater must always\nafterward tell_\nTHE TRUTH\n\nThis statement startled the Frogman. It even worried him, so that he\nleaped upon the bank and hurriedly began to dress himself.\n\n\"A great misfortune has befallen me,\" he told himself, \"for hereafter I\ncannot tell people I am wise, since it is not the truth. The truth is\nthat my boasted wisdom is all a sham, assumed by me to deceive people\nand make them defer to me. In truth, no living creature can know much\nmore than his fellows, for one may know one thing, and another know\nanother thing, so that wisdom is evenly scattered throughout the world.\nBut--ah, me!--what a terrible fate will now be mine. Even Cayke the\nCookie Cook will soon discover that my knowledge is no greater than her\nown; for having bathed in the enchanted water of the Truth Pond, I can\nno longer deceive her or tell a lie.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nMore humbled than he had been for many years, the Frogman went back to\nthe grove where he had left Cayke and found the woman now awake and\nwashing her face in a tiny brook.\n\n\"Where has Your Honor been?\" she asked.\n\n\"To a farmhouse to ask for something to eat,\" said he, \"but the woman\nrefused me.\"\n\n\"How dreadful!\" she exclaimed. \"But never mind; there are other houses,\nwhere the people will be glad to feed the Wisest Creature in all the\nWorld.\"\n\n\"Do you mean yourself?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, I mean you.\"\n\nThe Frogman felt strongly impelled to tell the truth, but struggled hard\nagainst it. His reason told him there was no use in letting Cayke know\nhe was not wise, for then she would lose much respect for him, but each\ntime he opened his mouth to speak he realized he was about to tell the\ntruth and shut it again as quickly as possible. He tried to talk about\nsomething else, but the words necessary to undeceive the woman would\nforce themselves to his lips in spite of all his struggles. Finally,\nknowing that he must either remain dumb or let the truth prevail, he\ngave a low groan of despair and said:\n\n\"Cayke, I am _not_ the Wisest Creature in all the World; I am not wise\nat all.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Oh, you must be!\" she protested. \"You told me so yourself, only last\nevening.\"\n\n\"Then last evening I failed to tell you the truth,\" he admitted, looking\nvery shamefaced, for a frog. \"I am sorry I told you that lie, my good\nCayke; but, if you must know the truth, the whole truth and nothing but\nthe truth, I am not really as wise as you are.\"\n\nThe Cookie Cook was greatly shocked to hear this, for it shattered one\nof her most pleasing illusions. She looked at the gorgeously dressed\nFrogman in amazement.\n\n\"What has caused you to change your mind so suddenly?\" she inquired.\n\n\"I have bathed in the Truth Pond,\" he said, \"and whoever bathes in that\nwater is ever afterward obliged to tell the truth.\"\n\n\"You were foolish to do that,\" declared the woman. \"It is often very\nembarrassing to tell the truth. I'm glad _I_ didn't bathe in that\ndreadful water!\"\n\nThe Frogman looked at his companion thoughtfully.\n\n\"Cayke,\" said he, \"I want you to go to the Truth Pond and take a bath in\nits water. For, if we are to travel together and encounter unknown\nadventures, it would not be fair that I alone must always tell you the\ntruth, while you could tell me whatever you pleased. If we both dip in\nthe enchanted water there will be no chance in the future of our\ndeceiving one another.\"\n\n\"No,\" she asserted, shaking her head positively, \"I won't do it, Your\nHonor. For, if I told you the truth, I'm sure you wouldn't like me. No\nTruth Pond for me. I'll be just as I am, an honest woman who can say\nwhat she wants to without hurting anyone's feelings.\"\n\nWith this decision the Frogman was forced to be content, although he was\nsorry the Cookie Cook would not listen to his advice.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nThe Unhappy Ferryman\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\n\nLeaving the grove where they had slept, the Frogman and the Cookie Cook\nturned to the east to seek another house and after a short walk came to\none where the people received them very politely. The children stared\nrather hard at the big, pompous Frogman, but the woman of the house,\nwhen Cayke asked for something to eat, at once brought them food and\nsaid they were welcome to it.\n\n\"Few people in need of help pass this way,\" she remarked, \"for the\nWinkies are all prosperous and love to stay in their own homes. But\nperhaps you are not a Winkle,\" she added.\n\n\"No,\" said Cayke, \"I am a Yip, and my home is on a high mountain at the\nsoutheast of your country.\"\n\n\"And the Frogman--is he, also, a Yip?\"\n\n\"I do not know what he is, other than a very remarkable and highly\neducated creature,\" replied the Cookie Cook. \"But he has lived many\nyears among the Yips, who have found him so wise and intelligent that\nthey always go to him for advice.\"\n\n\"May I ask why you have left your home, and where you are going?\" said\nthe Winkie woman.\n\nThen Cayke told her of the diamond-studded gold dishpan and how it had\nbeen mysteriously stolen from her house, after which she had discovered\nthat she could no longer cook good cookies. So she had resolved to\nsearch until she found her dishpan again, because a Cookie Cook who\ncannot cook good cookies is not of much use. The Frogman, who wanted to\nsee more of the world, had accompanied her to assist in the search. When\nthe woman had listened to this story she asked.\n\n\"Then you have no idea, as yet, who has stolen your dishpan?\"\n\n\"I only know it must have been some mischievous fairy, or a magician, or\nsome such powerful person, because none other could have climbed the\nsteep mountain to the Yip Country. And who else could have carried away\nmy beautiful, magic dishpan without being seen?\"\n\nThe woman thought about this during the time that Cayke and the Frogman\nate their breakfast. When they had finished she said:\n\n\"Where are you going next?\"\n\n\"We have not decided,\" answered the Cookie Cook.\n\n\"Our plan,\" explained the Frogman, in his important way, \"is to travel\nfrom place to place until we learn where the thief is located, and then\nto force him to return the dishpan to its proper owner.\"\n\n\"The plan is all right,\" agreed the woman, \"but it may take you a long\ntime before you succeed, your method being sort of haphazard and\nindefinite. However, I advise you to travel toward the east.\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked the Frogman.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Because if you went west you would soon come to the desert, and also\nbecause in this part of the Winkie Country no one steals, so your time\nhere would be wasted. But toward the east, beyond the river, live many\nstrange people whose honesty I would not vouch for. Moreover, if you\njourney far enough east and cross the river for a second time, you will\ncome to the Emerald City, where there is much magic and sorcery. The\nEmerald City is ruled by a dear little girl called Ozma, who also rules\nthe Emperor of the Winkies and all the Land of Oz. So, as Ozma is a\nfairy, she may be able to tell you just who has taken your precious\ndishpan. Provided, of course, you do not find it before you reach her.\"\n\n\"This seems to me to be excellent advice,\" said the Frogman, and Cayke\nagreed with him.\n\n\"The most sensible thing for you to do,\" continued the woman, \"would be\nto return to your home and use another dishpan, learning to cook cookies\nas other people cook cookies, without the aid of magic. But, if you\ncannot be happy without the magic dishpan you have lost, you are likely\nto learn more about it in the Emerald City than at any other place in\nOz.\"\n\nThey thanked the good woman and on leaving her house faced the east and\ncontinued in that direction all the way. Toward evening they came to the\nwest branch of the Winkie River and there, on the river bank, found a\nferryman who lived all alone in a little yellow house.\n\nThis ferryman was a Winkie with a very small head and a very large\nbody. He was sitting in his doorway as the travelers approached him and\ndid not even turn his head to look at them.\n\n\"Good evening,\" said the Frogman.\n\nThe ferryman made no reply.\n\n\"We would like some supper and the privilege of sleeping in your house\nuntil morning,\" continued the Frogman. \"At daybreak we would like some\nbreakfast and then we would like to have you row us across the river.\"\n\nThe ferryman neither moved nor spoke. He sat in his doorway and looked\nstraight ahead.\n\n\"I think he must be deaf and dumb,\" Cayke whispered to her companion.\nThen she stood directly in front of the ferryman and putting her mouth\nclose to his ear she yelled as loudly as she could:\n\n\"Good evening!\"\n\nThe ferryman scowled.\n\n\"Why do you yell at me, woman?\" he asked.\n\n\"Can you hear what I say?\" she asked in her ordinary tone of voice.\n\n\"Of course,\" replied the man.\n\n\"Then why didn't you answer the Frogman?\"\n\n\"Because,\" said the ferryman, \"I don't understand the frog language.\"\n\n\"He speaks the same words that I do and in the same way,\" declared\nCayke.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" replied the ferryman; \"but to me his voice sounded like a\nfrog's croak. I know that in the Land of Oz animals can speak our\nlanguage, and so can the birds and bugs and fishes; but in _my_ ears\nthey sound merely like growls and chirps and croaks.\"\n\n\"Why is that?\" asked the Cookie Cook in surprise.\n\n\"Once, many years ago, I cut the tail off a fox which had taunted me;\nand I stole some birds' eggs from a nest to make an omelet with, and\nalso I pulled a fish from the river and left it lying on the bank to\ngasp for lack of water until it died. I don't know why I did those\nwicked things, but I did them. So the Emperor of the Winkies--who is the\nTin Woodman and has a very tender tin heart--punished me by denying me\nany communication with beasts, birds or fishes. I cannot understand them\nwhen they speak to me, although I know that other people can do so, nor\ncan the creatures understand a word I say to them. Every time I meet one\nof them I am reminded of my former cruelty, and it makes me very\nunhappy.\"\n\n\"Really,\" said Cayke, \"I'm sorry for you, although the Tin Woodman is\nnot to blame for punishing you.\"\n\n\"What is he mumbling about?\" asked the Frogman.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"He is talking to me, but you don't understand him,\" she replied. And\nthen she told him of the ferryman's punishment and afterward explained\nto the ferryman that they wanted to stay all night with him and be fed.\n\nHe gave them some fruit and bread, which was the only sort of food he\nhad, and he allowed Cayke to sleep in a room of his cottage. But the\nFrogman he refused to admit to his house, saying that the frog's\npresence made him miserable and unhappy. At no time would he look\ndirectly at the Frogman, or even toward him, fearing he would shed tears\nif he did so; so the big frog slept on the river bank, where he could\nhear little frogs croaking in the river all the night through. But that\ndid not keep him awake; it merely soothed him to slumber, for he\nrealized how much superior he was to them.\n\nJust as the sun was rising on a new day the ferryman rowed the two\ntravelers across the river--keeping his back to the Frogman all the\nway--and then Cayke thanked him and bade him good-bye and the ferryman\nrowed home again.\n\nOn this side the river there were no paths at all, so it was evident\nthey had reached a part of the country little frequented by travelers.\nThere was a marsh at the south of them, sandhills at the north and a\ngrowth of scrubby underbrush leading toward a forest at the east. So the\neast was really the least difficult way to go and that direction was the\none they had determined to follow.\n\nNow the Frogman, although he wore green patent-leather shoes with ruby\nbuttons, had very large and flat feet, and when he tramped through the\nscrub his weight crushed down the underbrush and made a path for Cayke\nto follow him. Therefore they soon reached the forest, where the tall\ntrees were set far apart but were so leafy that they shaded all the\nspaces between them with their branches.\n\n\"There are no bushes here,\" said Cayke, much pleased, \"so we can now\ntravel faster and with more comfort.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nThe Big Lavender Bear\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\n\nIt was a pleasant place to wander in and the two travelers were\nproceeding at a brisk pace when suddenly a voice shouted:\n\n\"Halt!\"\n\nThey looked around in surprise, seeing at first no one at all. Then from\nbehind a tree there stepped a brown fuzzy bear, whose head came about as\nhigh as Cayke's waist--and Cayke was a small woman. The bear was chubby\nas well as fuzzy; his body was even puffy, while his legs and arms\nseemed jointed at the knees and elbows and fastened to his body by pins\nor rivets. His ears were round in shape and stuck out in a comical way,\nwhile his round black eyes were bright and sparkling as beads. Over his\nshoulder the little brown bear bore a gun with a tin barrel. The barrel\nhad a cork in the end of it and a string was attached to the cork and to\nthe handle of the gun.\n\nBoth the Frogman and Cayke gazed hard at this curious bear, standing\nsilent for some time. But finally the Frogman recovered from his\nsurprise and remarked:\n\n\"It seems to me that you are stuffed with sawdust and ought not to be\nalive.\"\n\n\"That's all you know about it,\" answered the little Brown Bear in a\nsqueaky voice. \"I am stuffed with a very good quality of curled hair and\nmy skin is the best plush that was ever made. As for my being alive,\nthat is my own affair and cannot concern you at all--except that it\ngives me the privilege to say you are my prisoners.\"\n\n\"Prisoners! Why do you speak such nonsense?\" asked the Frogman angrily.\n\"Do you think we are afraid of a toy bear with a toy gun?\"\n\n\"You ought to be,\" was the confident reply, \"for I am merely the sentry\nguarding the way to Bear Center, which is a city containing hundreds of\nmy race, who are ruled by a very powerful sorcerer known as the Lavender\nBear. He ought to be a purple color, you know, seeing he is a King, but\nhe's only light lavender, which is, of course, second-cousin to royal\npurple. So, unless you come with me peaceably, as my prisoners, I shall\nfire my gun and bring a hundred bears--of all sizes and colors--to\ncapture you.\"\n\n\"Why do you wish to capture us?\" inquired the Frogman, who had listened\nto this speech with much astonishment.\n\n\"I don't wish to, as a matter of fact,\" replied the little Brown Bear,\n\"but it is my duty to, because you are now trespassing on the domain of\nHis Majesty the King of Bear Center. Also I will admit that things are\nrather quiet in our city, just now, and the excitement of your capture,\nfollowed by your trial and execution, should afford us much\nentertainment.\"\n\n\"We defy you!\" said the Frogman.\n\n\"Oh, no; don't do that,\" pleaded Cayke, speaking to her companion. \"He\nsays his King is a sorcerer, so perhaps it is he or one of his bears who\nventured to steal my jeweled dishpan. Let us go to the City of the Bears\nand discover if my dishpan is there.\"\n\n\"I must now register one more charge against you,\" remarked the little\nBrown Bear, with evident satisfaction. \"You have just accused us of\nstealing, and that is such a dreadful thing to say that I am quite sure\nour noble King will command you to be executed.\"\n\n\"But how could you execute us?\" inquired the Cookie Cook.\n\n\"I've no idea. But our King is a wonderful inventor and there is no\ndoubt he can find a proper way to destroy you. So, tell me, are you\ngoing to struggle, or will you go peaceably to meet your doom?\"\n\nIt was all so ridiculous that Cayke laughed aloud and even the Frogman's\nwide mouth curled in a smile. Neither was a bit afraid to go to the Bear\nCity and it seemed to both that there was a possibility they might\ndiscover the missing dishpan. So the Frogman said:\n\n\"Lead the way, little Bear, and we will follow without a struggle.\"\n\n\"That's very sensible of you; very sensible, indeed!\" declared the Brown\nBear. \"So--for-ward _march_!\" and with the command he turned around and\nbegan to waddle along a path that led between the trees.\n\nCayke and the Frogman, as they followed their conductor, could scarce\nforbear laughing at his stiff, awkward manner of walking and, although\nhe moved his stuffy legs fast, his steps were so short that they had to\ngo slowly in order not to run into him. But after a time they reached a\nlarge, circular space in the center of the forest, which was clear of\nany stumps or underbrush. The ground was covered by a soft gray moss,\npleasant to tread upon. All the trees surrounding this space seemed to\nbe hollow and had round holes in their trunks, set a little way above\nthe ground, but otherwise there was nothing unusual about the place and\nnothing, in the opinion of the prisoners, to indicate a settlement. But\nthe little Brown Bear said in a proud and impressive voice (although it\nstill squeaked):\n\n\"This is the wonderful city known to fame as Bear Center!\"\n\n\"But there are no houses; there are no bears living here at all!\"\nexclaimed Cayke.\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\" retorted their captor and raising his gun he pulled the\ntrigger. The cork flew out of the tin barrel with a loud \"pop!\" and at\nonce from every hole in every tree within view of the clearing appeared\nthe head of a bear. They were of many colors and of many sizes, but\nall were made in the same manner as the bear who had met and captured\nthem.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\nAt first a chorus of growls arose and then a sharp voice cried:\n\n\"What has happened, Corporal Waddle?\"\n\n\"Captives, Your Majesty!\" answered the Brown Bear. \"Intruders upon our\ndomain and slanderers of our good name.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's important,\" answered the voice.\n\nThen from out the hollow trees tumbled a whole regiment of stuffed\nbears, some carrying tin swords, some popguns and others long spears\nwith gay ribbons tied to the handles. There were hundreds of them,\naltogether, and they quickly formed a circle around the Frogman and the\nCookie Cook but kept at a distance and left a large space for the\nprisoners to stand in.\n\nPresently this circle parted and into the center of it stalked a huge\ntoy bear of a lovely lavender color. He walked upon his hind legs, as\ndid all the others, and on his head he wore a tin crown set with\ndiamonds and amethysts, while in one paw he carried a short wand of some\nglittering metal that resembled silver but wasn't.\n\n\"His Majesty the King!\" shouted Corporal Waddle, and all the bears\nbowed low. Some bowed so low that they lost their balance and toppled\nover, but they soon scrambled up again and the Lavender King squatted on\nhis haunches before the prisoners and gazed at them steadily with his\nbright pink eyes.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nThe Little Pink Bear\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\n\n\"One Person and one Freak,\" said the big Lavender Bear, when he had\ncarefully examined the strangers.\n\n\"I am sorry to hear you call poor Cayke the Cookie Cook a Freak,\"\nremonstrated the Frogman.\n\n\"She is the Person,\" asserted the King. \"Unless I am mistaken, it is you\nwho are the Freak.\"\n\nThe Frogman was silent, for he could not truthfully deny it.\n\n\"Why have you dared intrude in my forest?\" demanded the Bear King.\n\n\"We didn't know it _was_ your forest,\" said Cayke, \"and we are on our\nway to the far east, where the Emerald City is.\"\n\n\"Ah, it's a long way from here to the Emerald City,\" remarked the King.\n\"It is so far away, indeed, that no bear among us has ever been there.\nBut what errand requires you to travel such a distance?\"\n\n\"Someone has stolen my diamond-studded gold dishpan,\" explained Cayke;\n\"and, as I cannot be happy without it, I have decided to search the\nworld over until I find it again. The Frogman, who is very learned and\nwonderfully wise, has come with me to give me his assistance. Isn't it\nkind of him?\"\n\nThe King looked at the Frogman.\n\n\"What makes you so wonderfully wise?\" he asked.\n\n\"I'm not,\" was the candid reply. \"The Cookie Cook, and some others in\nthe Yip Country, think because I am a big frog and talk and act like a\nman, that I must be very wise. I have learned more than a frog usually\nknows, it is true, but I am not yet so wise as I hope to become at some\nfuture time.\"\n\nThe King nodded, and when he did so something squeaked in his chest.\n\n\"Did Your Majesty speak?\" asked Cayke.\n\n\"Not just then,\" answered the Lavender Bear, seeming to be somewhat\nembarrassed. \"I am so built, you must know, that when anything pushes\nagainst my chest, as my chin accidentally did just then, I make that\nsilly noise. In this city it isn't considered good manners to notice it.\nBut I like your Frogman. He is honest and truthful, which is more than\ncan be said of many others. As for your late lamented dishpan, I'll show\nit to you.\"\n\nWith this he waved three times the metal wand which he held in his paw\nand instantly there appeared upon the ground, midway between the King\nand Cayke, a big round pan made of beaten gold. Around the top edge was\na row of small diamonds; around the center of the pan was another row of\nlarger diamonds; and at the bottom was a row of exceedingly large and\nbrilliant diamonds. In fact, they all sparkled magnificently and the pan\nwas so big and broad that it took a lot of diamonds to go around it\nthree times.\n\nCayke stared so hard that her eyes seemed about to pop out of her head.\n\n\"O-o-o-oh!\" she exclaimed, drawing a deep breath of delight.\n\n\"Is this your dishpan?\" inquired the King.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"It is--it is!\" cried the Cookie Cook, and rushing forward she fell on\nher knees and threw her arms around the precious pan. But her arms came\ntogether without meeting any resistance at all. Cayke tried to seize the\nedge, but found nothing to grasp. The pan was surely there, she thought,\nfor she could see it plainly; but it was not solid; she could not feel\nit at all. With a moan of astonishment and despair she raised her head\nto look at the Bear King, who was watching her actions curiously. Then\nshe turned to the pan again, only to find it had completely disappeared.\n\n\"Poor creature!\" murmured the King pityingly. \"You must have thought,\nfor the moment, that you had actually recovered your dishpan. But what\nyou saw was merely the image of it, conjured up by means of my magic. It\nis a pretty dishpan, indeed, though rather big and awkward to handle. I\nhope you will some day find it.\"\n\nCayke was grievously disappointed. She began to cry, wiping her eyes on\nher apron. The King turned to the throng of toy bears surrounding him\nand asked:\n\n\"Has any of you ever seen this golden dishpan before?\"\n\n\"No,\" they answered in a chorus.\n\nThe King seemed to reflect. Presently he inquired:\n\n\"Where is the Little Pink Bear?\"\n\n\"At home, Your Majesty,\" was the reply, \"Fetch him here,\" commanded the\nKing.\n\nSeveral of the bears waddled over to one of the trees and pulled from\nits hollow a tiny pink bear, smaller than any of the others. A big white\nbear carried the pink one in his arms and set it down beside the King,\narranging the joints of its legs so that it would stand upright.\n\nThis Pink Bear seemed lifeless until the King turned a crank which\nprotruded from its side, when the little creature turned its head\nstiffly from side to side and said in a small shrill voice:\n\n\"Hurrah for the King of Bear Center!\"\n\n\"Very good,\" said the big Lavender Bear; \"he seems to be working very\nwell to-day. Tell me, my Pink Pinkerton, what has become of this lady's\njeweled dishpan?\"\n\n\"U--u--u,\" said the Pink Bear, and then stopped short.\n\nThe King turned the crank again.\n\n\"U-g-u the Shoemaker has it,\" said the Pink Bear.\n\n\"Who is Ugu the Shoemaker?\" demanded the King, again turning the crank.\n\n\"A magician who lives on a mountain in a wickerwork castle,\" was the\nreply.\n\n\"Where is this mountain?\" was the next question.\n\n\"Nineteen miles and three furlongs from Bear Center to the northeast.\"\n\n\"And is the dishpan still at the castle of Ugu the Shoemaker?\" asked the\nKing.\n\n\"It is.\"\n\nThe King turned to Cayke.\n\n\"You may rely on this information,\" said he. \"The Pink Bear can tell us\nanything we wish to know, and his words are always words of truth.\"\n\n\"Is he alive?\" asked the Frogman, much interested in the Pink Bear.\n\n\"Something animates him--when you turn his crank,\" replied the King. \"I\ndo not know if it is life, or what it is, or how it happens that the\nLittle Pink Bear can answer correctly every question put to him. We\ndiscovered his talent a long time ago and whenever we wish to know\nanything--which is not very often--we ask the Pink Bear. There is no\ndoubt whatever, madam, that Ugu the Magician has your dishpan, and if\nyou dare go to him you may be able to recover it. But of that I am not\ncertain.\"\n\n\"Can't the Pink Bear tell?\" asked Cayke anxiously.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"No, for that is in the future. He can tell anything that _has_\nhappened, but nothing that is going to happen. Don't ask me why, for I\ndon't know.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the Cookie Cook, after a little thought, \"I mean to go to\nthis magician, anyhow, and tell him I want my dishpan. I wish I knew\nwhat Ugu the Shoemaker is like.\"\n\n\"Then I'll show him to you,\" promised the King. \"But do not be\nfrightened; it won't be Ugu, remember, but only his image.\"\n\nWith this he waved his metal wand again and in the circle suddenly\nappeared a thin little man, very old and skinny, who was seated on a\nwicker stool before a wicker table. On the table lay a Great Book with\ngold clasps. The Book was open and the man was reading in it. He wore\ngreat spectacles, which were fastened before his eyes by means of a\nribbon that passed around his head and was tied in a bow at the back.\nHis hair was very thin and white; his skin, which clung fast to his\nbones, was brown and seared with furrows; he had a big, fat nose and\nlittle eyes set close together.\n\nOn no account was Ugu the Shoemaker a pleasant person to gaze at. As his\nimage appeared before them, all were silent and intent until Corporal\nWaddle, the Brown Bear, became nervous and pulled the trigger of his\ngun. Instantly the cork flew out of the tin barrel with a loud \"pop!\"\nthat made them all jump. And, at this sound, the image of the magician\nvanished.\n\n\"So! _that's_ the thief, is it?\" said Cayke, in an angry voice. \"I\nshould think he'd be ashamed of himself for stealing a poor woman's\ndiamond dishpan! But I mean to face him in his wicker castle and force\nhim to return my property.\"\n\n\"To me,\" said the Bear King, reflectively, \"he looked like a dangerous\nperson. I hope he won't be so unkind as to argue the matter with you.\"\n\nThe Frogman was much disturbed by the vision of Ugu the Shoemaker, and\nCayke's determination to go to the magician filled her companion with\nmisgivings. But he would not break his pledged word to assist the Cookie\nCook and after breathing a deep sigh of resignation he asked the King:\n\n\"Will Your Majesty lend us this Pink Bear who answers questions, that we\nmay take him with us on our journey? He would be very useful to us and\nwe will promise to bring him safely back to you.\"\n\nThe King did not reply at once; he seemed to be thinking.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"_Please_ let us take the Pink Bear,\" begged Cayke. \"I'm sure he would\nbe a great help to us.\"\n\n\"The Pink Bear,\" said the King, \"is the best bit of magic I possess, and\nthere is not another like him in the world. I do not care to let him out\nof my sight; nor do I wish to disappoint you; so I believe I will make\nthe journey in your company and carry my Pink Bear with me. He can walk,\nwhen you wind the other side of him, but so slowly and awkwardly that he\nwould delay you. But if I go along I can carry him in my arms, so I will\njoin your party. Whenever you are ready to start, let me know.\"\n\n\"But--Your Majesty!\" exclaimed Corporal Waddle in protest, \"I hope you\ndo not intend to let these prisoners escape without punishment.\"\n\n\"Of what crime do you accuse them?\" inquired the King.\n\n\"Why, they trespassed on your domain, for one thing,\" said the Brown\nBear.\n\n\"We didn't know it was private property, Your Majesty,\" said the Cookie\nCook.\n\n\"And they asked if any of us had stolen the dishpan!\" continued Corporal\nWaddle indignantly. \"That is the same thing as calling us thieves and\nrobbers, and bandits and brigands, is it not?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Every person has the right to ask questions,\" said the Frogman.\n\n\"But the Corporal is quite correct,\" declared the Lavender Bear. \"I\ncondemn you both to death, the execution to take place ten years from\nthis hour.\"\n\n\"But we belong in the Land of Oz, where no one ever dies,\" Cayke\nreminded him.\n\n\"Very true,\" said the King. \"I condemn you to death merely as a matter\nof form. It sounds quite terrible, and in ten years we shall have\nforgotten all about it. Are you ready to start for the wicker castle of\nUgu the Shoemaker?\"\n\n\"Quite ready, Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"But who will rule in your place, while you are gone?\" asked a big\nYellow Bear.\n\n\"I myself will rule while I am gone,\" was the reply. \"A King isn't\nrequired to stay at home forever, and if he takes a notion to travel,\nwhose business is it but his own? All I ask is that you bears behave\nyourselves while I am away. If any of you is naughty, I'll send him to\nsome girl or boy in America to play with.\"\n\nThis dreadful threat made all the toy bears look solemn. They assured\nthe King, in a chorus of growls, that they would be good. Then the big\nLavender Bear picked up the little Pink Bear and after tucking it\ncarefully under one arm he said \"Good-bye till I come back!\" and waddled\nalong the path that led through the forest. The Frogman and Cayke the\nCookie Cook also said good-bye to the bears and then followed after the\nKing, much to the regret of the little Brown Bear, who pulled the\ntrigger of his gun and popped the cork as a parting salute.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nThe Meeting\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\n\nWhile the Frogman and his party were advancing from the west, Dorothy\nand her party were advancing from the east, and so it happened that on\nthe following night they all camped at a little hill that was only a few\nmiles from the wicker castle of Ugu the Shoemaker. But the two parties\ndid not see one another that night, for one camped on one side of the\nhill while the other camped on the opposite side. But the next morning\nthe Frogman thought he would climb the hill and see what was on top of\nit, and at the same time Scraps, the Patchwork Girl, also decided to\nclimb the hill to find if the wicker castle was visible from its top. So\nshe stuck her head over an edge just as the Frogman's head appeared over\nanother edge and both, being surprised, kept still while they took a\ngood look at one another.\n\nScraps recovered from her astonishment first and bounding upward she\nturned a somersault and landed sitting down and facing the big Frogman,\nwho slowly advanced and sat opposite her.\n\n\"Well met, Stranger!\" cried the Patchwork Girl, with a whoop of\nlaughter. \"You are quite the funniest individual I have seen in all my\ntravels.\"\n\n\"Do you suppose I can be any funnier than you?\" asked the Frogman,\ngazing at her in wonder.\n\n\"I'm not funny to myself, you know,\" returned Scraps. \"I wish I were.\nAnd perhaps you are so used to your own absurd shape that you do not\nlaugh whenever you see your reflection in a pool, or in a mirror.\"\n\n\"No,\" said the Frogman gravely, \"I do not. I used to be proud of my\ngreat size and vain of my culture and education, but since I bathed in\nthe Truth Pond I sometimes think it is not right that I should be\ndifferent from all other frogs.\"\n\n\"Right or wrong,\" said the Patchwork Girl, \"to be different is to be\ndistinguished. Now, in my case, I'm just like all other Patchwork Girls\nbecause I'm the only one there is. But, tell me, where did you come\nfrom?\"\n\n\"The Yip Country,\" said he.\n\n\"Is that in the Land of Oz?\"\n\n\"Of course,\" replied the Frogman.\n\n\"And do you know that your Ruler, Ozma of Oz, has been stolen?\"\n\n\"I was not aware that I had a Ruler, so of course I couldn't know that\nshe was stolen.\"\n\n\"Well, you have. All the people of Oz,\" explained Scraps, \"are ruled by\nOzma, whether they know it or not. And she has been stolen. Aren't you\nangry? Aren't you indignant? Your Ruler, whom you didn't know you had,\nhas positively been stolen!\"\n\n\"That is queer,\" remarked the Frogman thoughtfully. \"Stealing is a thing\npractically unknown in Oz, yet this Ozma has been taken and a friend of\nmine has also had her dishpan stolen. With her I have traveled all the\nway from the Yip Country in order to recover it.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"I don't see any connection between a Royal Ruler of Oz and a dishpan!\"\ndeclared Scraps.\n\n\"They've both been stolen, haven't they?\"\n\n\"True. But why can't your friend wash her dishes in another dishpan?\"\nasked Scraps.\n\n\"Why can't you use another Royal Ruler? I suppose you prefer the one who\nis lost, and my friend wants her own dishpan, which is made of gold and\nstudded with diamonds and has magic powers.\"\n\n\"Magic, eh?\" exclaimed Scraps. \"_There_ is a link that connects the two\nsteals, anyhow, for it seems that all the magic in the Land of Oz was\nstolen at the same time, whether it was in the Emerald City or in\nGlinda's castle or in the Yip Country. Seems mighty strange and\nmysterious, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"It used to seem that way to us,\" admitted the Frogman, \"but we have now\ndiscovered who took our dishpan. It was Ugu the Shoemaker.\"\n\n\"Ugu? Good gracious! That's the same magician we think has stolen Ozma.\nWe are now on our way to the castle of this Shoemaker.\"\n\n\"So are we,\" said the Frogman.\n\n\"Then follow me, quick! and let me introduce you to Dorothy and the\nother girls and to the Wizard of Oz and all the rest of us.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nShe sprang up and seized his coat-sleeve, dragging him off the hilltop\nand down the other side from that whence he had come. And at the foot of\nthe hill the Frogman was astonished to find the three girls and the\nWizard and Button-Bright, who were surrounded by a wooden Sawhorse, a\nlean Mule, a square Woozy and a Cowardly Lion. A little black dog ran up\nand smelled at the Frogman, but couldn't growl at him.\n\n\"I've discovered another party that has been robbed,\" shouted Scraps as\nshe joined them. \"This is their leader and they're all going to Ugu's\ncastle to fight the wicked Shoemaker!\"\n\nThey regarded the Frogman with much curiosity and interest and, finding\nall eyes fixed upon him, the newcomer arranged his necktie and smoothed\nhis beautiful vest and swung his gold-headed cane like a regular dandy.\nThe big spectacles over his eyes quite altered his froglike countenance\nand gave him a learned and impressive look. Used as she was to seeing\nstrange creatures in the Land of Oz, Dorothy was amazed at discovering\nthe Frogman. So were all her companions. Toto wanted to growl at him,\nbut couldn't, and he didn't dare bark. The Sawhorse snorted rather\ncontemptuously, but the Lion whispered to the wooden steed: \"Bear with\nthis strange creature, my friend, and remember he is no more\nextraordinary than you are. Indeed, it is more natural for a frog to be\nbig than for a Sawhorse to be alive.\"\n\nOn being questioned, the Frogman told them the whole story of the loss\nof Cayke's highly prized dishpan and their adventures in search of it.\nWhen he came to tell of the Lavender Bear King and of the Little Pink\nBear who could tell anything you wanted to know, his hearers became\neager to see such interesting animals.\n\n\"It will be best,\" said the Wizard, \"to unite our two parties and share\nour fortunes together, for we are all bound on the same errand and as\none band we may more easily defy this shoemaker magician than if\nseparate. Let us be allies.\"\n\n\"I will ask my friends about that,\" replied the Frogman, and climbed\nover the hill to find Cayke and the toy bears. The Patchwork Girl\naccompanied him and when they came upon the Cookie Cook and the Lavender\nBear and the Pink Bear it was hard to tell which of the lot was the most\nsurprised.\n\n\"Mercy me!\" cried Cayke, addressing the Patchwork Girl. \"However did you\ncome alive?\"\n\nScraps stared at the bears.\n\n\"Mercy me!\" she echoed; \"you are stuffed, as I am, with cotton, and yet\nyou appear to be living. That makes me feel ashamed, for I have prided\nmyself on being the only live cotton-stuffed person in Oz.\"\n\n\"Perhaps you are,\" returned the Lavender Bear, \"for I am stuffed with\nextra-quality curled hair, and so is the Little Pink Bear.\"\n\n\"You have relieved my mind of a great anxiety,\" declared the Patchwork\nGirl, now speaking more cheerfully. \"The Scarecrow is stuffed with\nstraw, and you with hair, so I am still the Original and Only\nCotton-Stuffed!\"\n\n\"I hope I am too polite to criticize cotton, as compared with curled\nhair,\" said the King, \"especially as you seem satisfied with it.\"\n\nThen the Frogman told of his interview with the party from the Emerald\nCity and added that the Wizard of Oz had invited the bears and Cayke and\nhimself to travel in company with them to the castle of Ugu the\nShoemaker. Cayke was much pleased, but the Bear King looked solemn. He\nset the Little Pink Bear on his lap and turned the crank in its side and\nasked:\n\n\"Is it safe for us to associate with those people from the Emerald\nCity?\"\n\nAnd the Pink Bear at once replied:\n\n    \"Safe for you and safe for me;\n    Perhaps no others safe will be.\"\n\n\"That 'perhaps' need not worry us,\" said the King; \"so let us join the\nothers and offer them our protection.\"\n\nEven the Lavender Bear was astonished, however, when on climbing over\nthe hill he found on the other side the group of queer animals and the\npeople from the Emerald City. The bears and Cayke were received very\ncordially, although Button-Bright was cross when they wouldn't let him\nplay with the Little Pink Bear. The three girls greatly admired the toy\nbears, and especially the pink one, which they longed to hold.\n\n\"You see,\" explained the Lavender King, in denying them this privilege,\n\"he's a very valuable bear, because his magic is a correct guide on all\noccasions, and especially if one is in difficulties. It was the Pink\nBear who told us that Ugu the Shoemaker had stolen the Cookie Cook's\ndishpan.\"\n\n\"And the King's magic is just as wonderful,\" added Cayke, \"because it\nshowed us the Magician himself.\"\n\n\"What did he look like?\" inquired Dorothy.\n\n\"He was dreadful!\"\n\n\"He was sitting at a table and examining an immense Book which had three\ngolden clasps,\" remarked the King.\n\n\"Why, that must have been Glinda's Great Book of Records!\" exclaimed\nDorothy. \"If it is, it proves that Ugu the Shoemaker stole Ozma, and\nwith her all the magic in the Emerald City.\"\n\n\"And my dishpan,\" said Cayke. And the Wizard added:\n\n\"It also proves that he is following our adventures in the Book of\nRecords, and therefore knows that we are seeking him and that we are\ndetermined to find him and rescue Ozma at all hazards.\"\n\n\"If we can,\" added the Woozy, but everybody frowned at him.\n\nThe Wizard's statement was so true that the faces around him were very\nserious until the Patchwork Girl broke into a peal of laughter.\n\n\"Wouldn't it be a rich joke if he made prisoners of _us_, too?\" she\nsaid.\n\n\"No one but a crazy Patchwork Girl would consider _that_ a joke,\"\ngrumbled Button-Bright. And then the Lavender Bear King asked:\n\n\"Would you like to see this magical shoemaker?\"\n\n\"Wouldn't he know it?\" Dorothy inquired.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"No, I think not.\"\n\nThen the King waved his metal wand and before them appeared a room in\nthe wicker castle of Ugu. On the wall of the room hung Ozma's Magic\nPicture, and seated before it was the Magician. They could see the\nPicture as well as he could, because it faced them, and in the Picture\nwas the hillside where they were now sitting, all their forms being\nreproduced in miniature. And, curiously enough, within the scene of the\nPicture was the scene they were now beholding, so they knew that the\nMagician was at this moment watching them in the Picture, and also that\nhe saw himself and the room he was in become visible to the people on\nthe hillside. Therefore he knew very well that they were watching him\nwhile he was watching them.\n\nIn proof of this, Ugu sprang from his seat and turned a scowling face in\ntheir direction; but now he could not see the travelers who were seeking\nhim, although they could still see him. His actions were so distinct,\nindeed, that it seemed he was actually before them.\n\n\"It is only a ghost,\" said the Bear King. \"It isn't real at all, except\nthat it shows us Ugu just as he looks and tells us truly just what he is\ndoing.\"\n\n\"I don't see anything of my lost growl, though,\" said Toto, as if to\nhimself.\n\nThen the vision faded away and they could see nothing but the grass and\ntrees and bushes around them.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nThe Conference\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\n\n\"Now, then,\" said the Wizard, \"let us talk this matter over and decide\nwhat to do when we get to Ugu's wicker castle. There can be no doubt\nthat the Shoemaker is a powerful Magician, and his powers have been\nincreased a hundredfold since he secured the Great Book of Records, the\nMagic Picture, all of Glinda's recipes for sorcery and my own black\nbag--which was full of tools of wizardry. The man who could rob us of\nthose things, and the man with all their powers at his command, is one\nwho may prove somewhat difficult to conquer; therefore we should plan\nour actions well before we venture too near to his castle.\"\n\n\"I didn't see Ozma in the Magic Picture,\" said Trot. \"What do you\nsuppose Ugu has done with her?\"\n\n\"Couldn't the Little Pink Bear tell us what he did with Ozma?\" asked\nButton-Bright.\n\n\"To be sure,\" replied the Lavender King; \"I'll ask him.\"\n\nSo he turned the crank in the Little Pink Bear's side and inquired:\n\n\"Did Ugu the Shoemaker steal Ozma of Oz?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the Little Pink Bear.\n\n\"Then what did he do with her?\" asked the King.\n\n\"Shut her up in a dark place,\" answered the Little Pink Bear.\n\n\"Oh, that must be a dungeon cell!\" cried Dorothy, horrified. \"How\ndreadful!\"\n\n\"Well, we must get her out of it,\" said the Wizard. \"That is what we\ncame for and of course we must rescue Ozma. But--how?\"\n\nEach one looked at some other one for an answer and all shook their\nheads in a grave and dismal manner. All but Scraps, who danced around\nthem gleefully.\n\n\"You're afraid,\" said the Patchwork Girl, \"because so many things can\nhurt your meat bodies. Why don't you give it up and go home? How can you\nfight a great magician when you have nothing to fight with?\"\n\nDorothy looked at her reflectively.\n\n\"Scraps,\" said she, \"you know that Ugu couldn't hurt you, a bit,\nwhatever he did; nor could he hurt me, 'cause I wear the Nome King's\nMagic Belt. S'pose just we two go on together, and leave the others here\nto wait for us?\"\n\n\"No, no!\" said the Wizard positively. \"That won't do at all. Ozma is\nmore powerful than either of you, yet she could not defeat the wicked\nUgu, who has shut her up in a dungeon. We must go to the Shoemaker in\none mighty band, for only in union is there strength.\"\n\n\"That is excellent advice,\" said the Lavender Bear, approvingly.\n\n\"But what can we do, when we get to Ugu?\" inquired the Cookie Cook\nanxiously.\n\n\"Do not expect a prompt answer to that important question,\" replied the\nWizard, \"for we must first plan our line of conduct. Ugu knows, of\ncourse, that we are after him, for he has seen our approach in the Magic\nPicture, and he has read of all we have done up to the present moment in\nthe Great Book of Records. Therefore we cannot expect to take him by\nsurprise.\"\n\n\"Don't you suppose Ugu would listen to reason?\" asked Betsy. \"If we\nexplained to him how wicked he has been, don't you think he'd let poor\nOzma go?\"\n\n\"And give me back my dishpan?\" added the Cookie Cook eagerly.\n\n\"Yes, yes; won't he say he's sorry and get on his knees and beg our\npardon?\" cried Scraps, turning a flip-flop to show her scorn of the\nsuggestion. \"When Ugu the Shoemaker does that, please knock at the front\ndoor and let me know.\"\n\nThe Wizard sighed and rubbed his bald head with a puzzled air.\n\n\"I'm quite sure Ugu will not be polite to us,\" said he, \"so we must\nconquer this cruel magician by force, much as we dislike to be rude to\nanyone. But none of you has yet suggested a way to do that. Couldn't the\nLittle Pink Bear tell us how?\" he asked, turning to the Bear King.\n\n\"No, for that is something that is _going_ to happen,\" replied the\nLavender Bear. \"He can only tell us what already _has_ happened.\"\n\nAgain they were grave and thoughtful. But after a time Betsy said in a\nhesitating voice:\n\n\"Hank is a great fighter; perhaps _he_ could conquer the magician.\"\n\nThe Mule turned his head to look reproachfully at his old friend, the\nyoung girl.\n\n\"Who can fight against magic?\" he asked.\n\n\"The Cowardly Lion could,\" said Dorothy.\n\nThe Lion, who was lying with his front legs spread out, his chin on his\npaws, raised his shaggy head.\n\n\"I can fight when I'm not afraid,\" said he calmly; \"but the mere mention\nof a fight sets me to trembling.\"\n\n\"Ugu's magic couldn't hurt the Sawhorse,\" suggested tiny Trot.\n\n\"And the Sawhorse couldn't hurt the Magician,\" declared that wooden\nanimal.\n\n\"For my part,\" said Toto, \"I am helpless, having lost my growl.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said Cayke the Cookie Cook, \"we must depend upon the Frogman.\nHis marvelous wisdom will surely inform him how to conquer the wicked\nMagician and restore to me my dishpan.\"\n\nAll eyes were now turned questioningly upon the Frogman. Finding himself\nthe center of observation, he swung his gold-headed cane, adjusted his\nbig spectacles and after swelling out his chest, sighed and said in a\nmodest tone of voice:\n\n\"Respect for truth obliges me to confess that Cayke is mistaken in\nregard to my superior wisdom. I am not very wise. Neither have I had any\npractical experience in conquering magicians. But let us consider this\ncase. What is Ugu, and what is a magician? Ugu is a renegade shoemaker\nand a magician is an ordinary man who, having learned how to do magical\ntricks, considers himself above his fellows. In this case, the Shoemaker\nhas been naughty enough to steal a lot of magical tools and things that\ndid not belong to him, and it is more wicked to steal than to be a\nmagician. Yet, with all the arts at his command, Ugu is still a man, and\nsurely there are ways in which a man may be conquered. How, do you say,\nhow? Allow me to state that I don't know. In my judgment we cannot\ndecide how best to act until we get to Ugu's castle. So let us go to it\nand take a look at it. After that we may discover an idea that will\nguide us to victory.\"\n\n\"That may not be a wise speech, but it sounds good,\" said Dorothy\napprovingly. \"Ugu the Shoemaker is not only a common man, but he's a\nwicked man and a cruel man and deserves to be conquered. We mustn't have\nany mercy on him till Ozma is set free. So let's go to his castle, as\nthe Frogman says, and see what the place looks like.\"\n\nNo one offered an objection to this plan and so it was adopted. They\nbroke camp and were about to start on the journey to Ugu's castle when\nthey discovered that Button-Bright was lost again. The girls and the\nWizard shouted his name and the Lion roared and the Donkey brayed and\nthe Frogman croaked and the Big Lavender Bear growled (to the envy of\nToto, who couldn't growl but barked his loudest) yet none of them could\nmake Button-Bright hear. So, after vainly searching for the boy a full\nhour, they formed a procession and proceeded in the direction of the\nwicker castle of Ugu the Shoemaker.\n\n\"Button-Bright's always getting lost,\" said Dorothy. \"And, if he wasn't\nalways getting found again, I'd prob'ly worry. He may have gone ahead of\nus, and he may have gone back; but, wherever he is, we'll find him\nsometime and somewhere, I'm almost sure.\"\n\n\n\n\nUgu the Shoemaker\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\n\nA curious thing about Ugu the Shoemaker was that he didn't suspect, in\nthe least, that he was wicked. He wanted to be powerful and great and he\nhoped to make himself master of all the Land of Oz, that he might compel\neveryone in that fairy country to obey him. His ambition blinded him to\nthe rights of others and he imagined anyone else would act just as he\ndid if anyone else happened to be as clever as himself.\n\nWhen he inhabited his little shoemaking shop in the City of Herku he had\nbeen discontented, for a shoemaker is not looked upon with high respect\nand Ugu knew that his ancestors had been famous magicians for many\ncenturies past and therefore his family was above the ordinary. Even his\nfather practiced magic, when Ugu was a boy; but his father had wandered\naway from Herku and had never come back again. So, when Ugu grew up, he\nwas forced to make shoes for a living, knowing nothing of the magic of\nhis forefathers. But one day, in searching through the attic of his\nhouse, he discovered all the books of magical recipes and many magical\ninstruments which had formerly been in use in his family. From that day\nhe stopped making shoes and began to study magic. Finally he aspired to\nbecome the greatest magician in Oz, and for days and weeks and months he\nthought on a plan to render all the other sorcerers and wizards, as well\nas those with fairy powers, helpless to oppose him.\n\nFrom the books of his ancestors he learned the following facts:\n\n(1) That Ozma of Oz was the fairy ruler of the Emerald City and the Land\nof Oz, and that she could not be destroyed by any magic ever devised.\nAlso, by means of her Magic Picture she would be able to discover\nanyone who approached her royal palace with the idea of conquering it.\n\n(2) That Glinda the Good was the most powerful Sorceress in Oz, among\nher other magical possessions being the Great Book of Records, which\ntold her all that happened anywhere in the world. This Book of Records\nwas very dangerous to Ugu's plans and Glinda was in the service of Ozma\nand would use her arts of sorcery to protect the girl Ruler.\n\n(3) That the Wizard of Oz, who lived in Ozma's palace, had been taught\nmuch powerful magic by Glinda and had a bag of magic tools with which he\nmight be able to conquer the Shoemaker.\n\n(4) That there existed in Oz--in the Yip Country--a jeweled dishpan made\nof gold, which dishpan possessed marvelous powers of magic. At a magic\nword, which Ugu learned from the book, the dishpan would grow large\nenough for a man to sit inside it. Then, when he grasped both the golden\nhandles, the dishpan would transport him in an instant to any place he\nwished to go within the borders of the Land of Oz.\n\nNo one now living, except Ugu, knew of the powers of this Magic Dishpan;\nso, after long study, the shoemaker decided that if he could manage to\nsecure the dishpan he could, by its means, rob Ozma and Glinda and the\nWizard of Oz of all their magic, thus becoming himself the most powerful\nperson in all the land.\n\nHis first act was to go away from the City of Herku and build for\nhimself the Wicker Castle in the hills. Here he carried his books and\ninstruments of magic and here for a full year he diligently practiced\nall the magical arts learned from his ancestors. At the end of that time\nhe could do a good many wonderful things.\n\nThen, when all his preparations were made, he set out for the Yip\nCountry and climbing the steep mountain at night he entered the house of\nCayke the Cookie Cook and stole her diamond-studded gold dishpan while\nall the Yips were asleep. Taking his prize outside, he set the pan upon\nthe ground and uttered the required magic word. Instantly the dishpan\ngrew as large as a big washtub and Ugu seated himself in it and grasped\nthe two handles. Then he wished himself in the great drawing-room of\nGlinda the Good.\n\nHe was there in a flash. First he took the Great Book of Records and put\nit in the dishpan. Then he went to Glinda's laboratory and took all her\nrare chemical compounds and her instruments of sorcery, placing these\nalso in the dishpan, which he caused to grow large enough to hold them.\nNext he seated himself amongst the treasures he had stolen and wished\nhimself in the room in Ozma's palace which the Wizard occupied and where\nhe kept his bag of magic tools. This bag Ugu added to his plunder and\nthen wished himself in the apartments of Ozma.\n\nHere he first took the Magic Picture from the wall and then seized all\nthe other magical things which Ozma possessed. Having placed these in\nthe dishpan he was about to climb in himself when he looked up and saw\nOzma standing beside him. Her fairy instinct had warned her that danger\nwas threatening her, so the beautiful girl Ruler rose from her couch and\nleaving her bedchamber at once confronted the thief.\n\nUgu had to think quickly, for he realized that if he permitted Ozma to\nrouse the inmates of her palace all his plans and his present successes\nwere likely to come to naught. So he threw a scarf over the girl's head,\nso she could not scream, and pushed her into the dishpan and tied her\nfast, so she could not move. Then he climbed in beside her and wished\nhimself in his own wicker castle. The Magic Dishpan was there in an\ninstant, with all its contents, and Ugu rubbed his hands together in\ntriumphant joy as he realized that he now possessed all the important\nmagic in the Land of Oz and could force all the inhabitants of that\nfairyland to do as he willed.\n\nSo quickly had his journey been accomplished that before daylight the\nrobber magician had locked Ozma in a room, making her a prisoner, and\nhad unpacked and arranged all his stolen goods. The next day he placed\nthe Book of Records on his table and hung the Magic Picture on his wall\nand put away in his cupboards and drawers all the elixirs and magic\ncompounds he had stolen. The magical instruments he polished and\narranged, and this was fascinating work and made him very happy. The\nonly thing that bothered him was Ozma. By turns the imprisoned Ruler\nwept and scolded the Shoemaker, haughtily threatening him with dire\npunishment for the wicked deeds he had done. Ugu became somewhat afraid\nof his fairy prisoner, in spite of the fact that he believed he had\nrobbed her of all her powers; so he performed an enchantment that\nquickly disposed of her and placed her out of his sight and hearing.\nAfter that, being occupied with other things, he soon forgot her.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nBut now, when he looked into the Magic Picture and read the Great Book\nof Records, the Shoemaker learned that his wickedness was not to go\nunchallenged. Two important expeditions had set out to find him and\nforce him to give up his stolen property. One was the party headed by\nthe Wizard and Dorothy, while the other consisted of Cayke and the\nFrogman. Others were also searching, but not in the right places. These\ntwo groups, however, were headed straight for the wicker castle and so\nUgu began to plan how best to meet them and to defeat their efforts to\nconquer him.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nMore Surprises\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\n\nAll that first day after the union of the two parties our friends\nmarched steadily toward the wicker castle of Ugu the Shoemaker. When\nnight came they camped in a little grove and passed a pleasant evening\ntogether, although some of them were worried because Button-Bright was\nstill lost.\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Toto, as the animals lay grouped together for the night,\n\"this Shoemaker who stole my growl, and who stole Ozma, has also stolen\nButton-Bright.\"\n\n\"How do you know that the Shoemaker stole your growl?\" demanded the\nWoozy.\n\n\"He has stolen about everything else of value in Oz, hasn't he?\" replied\nthe dog.\n\n\"He has stolen everything he wants, perhaps,\" agreed the Lion; \"but what\ncould anyone want with your growl?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the dog, wagging his tail slowly, \"my recollection is that\nit was a wonderful growl, soft and low and--and--\"\n\n\"And ragged at the edges,\" said the Sawhorse.\n\n\"So,\" continued Toto, \"if that magician hadn't any growl of his own, he\nmight have wanted mine and stolen it.\"\n\n\"And, if he has, he will soon wish he hadn't,\" remarked the Mule. \"Also,\nif he has stolen Button-Bright he will be sorry.\"\n\n\"Don't you like Button-Bright, then?\" asked the Lion in surprise.\n\n\"It isn't a question of liking him,\" replied the Mule. \"It's a question\nof watching him and looking after him. Any boy who causes his friends so\nmuch worry isn't worth having around. _I_ never get lost.\"\n\n\"If you did,\" said Toto, \"no one would worry a bit. I think\nButton-Bright is a very lucky boy, because he always gets found.\"\n\n\"See here,\" said the Lion, \"this chatter is keeping us all awake and\nto-morrow is likely to be a busy day. Go to sleep and forget your\nquarrels.\"\n\n\"Friend Lion,\" retorted the dog, \"if I hadn't lost my growl you would\nhear it now. I have as much right to talk as you have to sleep.\"\n\nThe Lion sighed.\n\n\"If only you had lost your voice, when you lost your growl,\" said he,\n\"you would be a more agreeable companion.\"\n\nBut they quieted down, after that, and soon the entire camp was wrapped\nin slumber.\n\nNext morning they made an early start but had hardly proceeded on their\nway an hour when, on climbing a slight elevation, they beheld in the\ndistance a low mountain, on top of which stood Ugu's wicker castle. It\nwas a good-sized building and rather pretty because the sides, roofs and\ndomes were all of wicker closely woven, as it is in fine baskets.\n\n\"I wonder if it is strong?\" said Dorothy musingly, as she eyed the queer\ncastle.\n\n\"I suppose it is, since a magician built it,\" answered the Wizard.\n\"With magic to protect it, even a paper castle might be as strong as if\nmade of stone. This Ugu must be a man of ideas, because he does things\nin a different way from other people.\"\n\n\"Yes; no one else would steal our dear Ozma,\" sighed tiny Trot.\n\n\"I wonder if Ozma is there?\" said Betsy, indicating the castle with a\nnod of her head.\n\n\"Where else could she be?\" asked Scraps.\n\n\"S'pose we ask the Pink Bear,\" suggested Dorothy.\n\nThat seemed a good idea, so they halted the procession and the Bear King\nheld the little Pink Bear on his lap and turned the crank in its side\nand asked:\n\n\"Where is Ozma of Oz?\"\n\nAnd the little Pink Bear answered:\n\n\"She is in a hole in the ground, a half mile away, at your left.\"\n\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Dorothy. \"Then she is not in Ugu's castle at\nall.\"\n\n\"It is lucky we asked that question,\" said the Wizard; \"for, if we can\nfind Ozma and rescue her, there will be no need for us to fight that\nwicked and dangerous magician.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Cayke. \"Then what about my dishpan?\"\n\nThe Wizard looked puzzled at her tone of remonstrance, so she added:\n\n\"Didn't you people from the Emerald City promise that we would all stick\ntogether, and that you would help me to get my dishpan if I would help\nyou to get your Ozma? And didn't I bring to you the little Pink Bear,\nwhich has told you where Ozma is hidden?\"\n\n\"She's right,\" said Dorothy to the Wizard. \"We must do as we agreed.\"\n\n\"Well, first of all, let us go and rescue Ozma,\" proposed the Wizard.\n\"Then our beloved Ruler may be able to advise us how to conquer Ugu the\nShoemaker.\"\n\nSo they turned to the left and marched for half a mile until they came\nto a small but deep hole in the ground. At once all rushed to the brim\nto peer into the hole, but instead of finding there Princess Ozma of Oz,\nall that they saw was Button-Bright, who was lying asleep on the bottom.\n\nTheir cries soon wakened the boy, who sat up and rubbed his eyes. When\nhe recognized his friends he smiled sweetly, saying: \"Found again!\"\n\n\"Where is Ozma?\" inquired Dorothy anxiously.\n\n\"I don't know,\" answered Button-Bright from the depths of the hole. \"I\ngot lost, yesterday, as you may remember, and in the night, while I was\nwandering around in the moonlight, trying to find my way back to you, I\nsuddenly fell into this hole.\"\n\n\"And wasn't Ozma in it then?\"\n\n\"There was no one in it but me, and I was sorry it wasn't entirely\nempty. The sides are so steep I can't climb out, so there was nothing to\nbe done but sleep until someone found me. Thank you for coming. If\nyou'll please let down a rope I'll empty this hole in a hurry.\"\n\n\"How strange!\" said Dorothy, greatly disappointed. \"It's evident the\nPink Bear didn't tell us the truth.\"\n\n\"He never makes a mistake,\" declared the Lavender Bear King, in a tone\nthat showed his feelings were hurt. And then he turned the crank of the\nlittle Pink Bear again and asked: \"Is this the hole that Ozma of Oz is\nin?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered the Pink Bear.\n\n\"That settles it,\" said the King, positively. \"Your Ozma is in this hole\nin the ground.\"\n\n\"Don't be silly,\" returned Dorothy impatiently. \"Even your beady eyes\ncan see there is no one in the hole but Button-Bright.\"\n\n\"Perhaps Button-Bright is Ozma,\" suggested the King.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"And perhaps he isn't! Ozma is a girl, and Button-Bright is a boy.\"\n\n\"Your Pink Bear must be out of order,\" said the Wizard; \"for, this time\nat least, his machinery has caused him to make an untrue statement.\"\n\nThe Bear King was so angry at this remark that he turned away, holding\nthe Pink Bear in his paws, and refused to discuss the matter in any\nfurther way.\n\n\"At any rate,\" said the Frogman, \"the Pink Bear has led us to your boy\nfriend and so enabled you to rescue him.\"\n\nScraps was leaning so far over the hole, trying to find Ozma in it, that\nsuddenly she lost her balance and pitched in headforemost. She fell upon\nButton-Bright and tumbled him over, but he was not hurt by her soft\nstuffed body and only laughed at the mishap. The Wizard buckled some\nstraps together and let one end of them down into the hole, and soon\nboth Scraps and the boy had climbed up and were standing safely beside\nthe others.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThey looked once more for Ozma, but the hole was now absolutely vacant.\nIt was a round hole, so from the top they could plainly see every part\nof it. Before they left the place Dorothy went to the Bear King and\nsaid:\n\n\"I'm sorry we couldn't believe what the little Pink Bear said, 'cause we\ndon't want to make you feel bad by doubting him. There must be a\nmistake, somewhere, and we prob'ly don't understand just what the little\nPink Bear means. Will you let me ask him one more question?\"\n\nThe Lavender Bear King was a good-natured bear, considering how he was\nmade and stuffed and jointed, so he accepted Dorothy's apology and\nturned the crank and allowed the little girl to question his wee Pink\nBear.\n\n\"Is Ozma _really_ in this hole?\" asked Dorothy.\n\n\"No,\" said the little Pink Bear.\n\nThis surprised everybody. Even the Bear King was now puzzled by the\ncontradictory statements of his oracle.\n\n\"Where _is_ she?\" asked the King.\n\n\"Here, among you,\" answered the little Pink Bear.\n\n\"Well,\" said Dorothy, \"this beats me, entirely! I guess the little Pink\nBear has gone crazy.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" called Scraps, who was rapidly turning \"cart-wheels\" all\naround the perplexed group, \"Ozma is invisible.\"\n\n\"Of course!\" cried Betsy. \"That would account for it.\"\n\n\"Well, I've noticed that people can speak, even when they've been made\ninvisible,\" said the Wizard. And then he looked all around him and said\nin a solemn voice: \"Ozma, are you here?\"\n\nThere was no reply. Dorothy asked the question, too, and so did\nButton-Bright and Trot and Betsy; but none received any reply at all.\n\n\"It's strange--it's terrible strange!\" muttered Cayke the Cookie Cook.\n\"I was sure that the little Pink Bear always tells the truth.\"\n\n\"I still believe in his honesty,\" said the Frogman, and this tribute so\npleased the Bear King that he gave these last speakers grateful looks,\nbut still gazed sourly on the others.\n\n\"Come to think of it,\" remarked the Wizard, \"Ozma couldn't be invisible,\nfor she is a fairy and fairies cannot be made invisible against their\nwill. Of course she could be imprisoned by the magician, or even\nenchanted, or transformed, in spite of her fairy powers; but Ugu could\nnot render her invisible by any magic at his command.\"\n\n\"I wonder if she's been transformed into Button-Bright?\" said Dorothy\nnervously. Then she looked steadily at the boy and asked: \"Are you Ozma?\nTell me truly!\"\n\nButton-Bright laughed.\n\n\"You're getting rattled, Dorothy,\" he replied. \"Nothing ever enchants\n_me_. If I were Ozma, do you think I'd have tumbled into that hole?\"\n\n\"Anyhow,\" said the Wizard, \"Ozma would never try to deceive her friends,\nor prevent them from recognizing her, in whatever form she happened to\nbe. The puzzle is still a puzzle, so let us go on to the wicker castle\nand question the magician himself. Since it was he who stole our Ozma,\nUgu is the one who must tell us where to find her.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nMagic Against Magic\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 21\n\n\nThe Wizard's advice was good, so again they started in the direction of\nthe low mountain on the crest of which the wicker castle had been built.\nThey had been gradually advancing up hill, so now the elevation seemed\nto them more like a round knoll than a mountain-top. However, the sides\nof the knoll were sloping and covered with green grass, so there was a\nstiff climb before them yet.\n\nUndaunted, they plodded on and had almost reached the knoll when they\nsuddenly observed that it was surrounded by a circle of flame. At first\nthe flames barely rose above the ground, but presently they grew higher\nand higher until a circle of flaming tongues of fire taller than any of\ntheir heads quite surrounded the hill on which the wicker castle stood.\nWhen they approached the flames the heat was so intense that it drove\nthem back again.\n\n\"This will never do for me!\" exclaimed the Patchwork Girl. \"I catch fire\nvery easily.\"\n\n\"It won't do for me, either,\" grumbled the Sawhorse, prancing to the\nrear.\n\n\"I also object strongly to fire,\" said the Bear King, following the\nSawhorse to a safe distance and hugging the little Pink Bear with his\npaws.\n\n\"I suppose the foolish Shoemaker imagines these blazes will stop us,\"\nremarked the Wizard, with a smile of scorn for Ugu. \"But I am able to\ninform you that this is merely a simple magic trick which the robber\nstole from Glinda the Good, and by good fortune I know how to destroy\nthese flames, as well as how to produce them. Will some one of you\nkindly give me a match?\"\n\nYou may be sure the girls carried no matches, nor did the Frogman or\nCayke or any of the animals. But Button-Bright, after searching\ncarefully through his pockets, which contained all sorts of useful and\nuseless things, finally produced a match and handed it to the Wizard,\nwho tied it to the end of a branch which he tore from a small tree\ngrowing near them. Then the little Wizard carefully lighted the match\nand running forward thrust it into the nearest flame. Instantly the\ncircle of fire began to die away and soon vanished completely, leaving\nthe way clear for them to proceed.\n\n\"That was funny!\" laughed Button-Bright.\n\n\"Yes,\" agreed the Wizard, \"it seems odd that a little match could\ndestroy such a great circle of fire, but when Glinda invented this trick\nshe believed no one would ever think of a match being a remedy for fire.\nI suppose even Ugu doesn't know how we managed to quench the flames of\nhis barrier, for only Glinda and I know the secret. Glinda's Book of\nMagic, which Ugu stole, told how to make the flames, but not how to put\nthem out.\"\n\nThey now formed in marching order and proceeded to advance up the slope\nof the hill; but had not gone far when before them rose a wall of steel,\nthe surface of which was thickly covered with sharp, gleaming points\nresembling daggers. The wall completely surrounded the wicker castle\nand its sharp points prevented anyone from climbing it. Even the\nPatchwork Girl might be ripped to pieces if she dared attempt it.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed the Wizard cheerfully, \"Ugu is now using one of my own\ntricks against me. But this is more serious than the Barrier of Fire,\nbecause the only way to destroy the wall is to get on the other side of\nit.\"\n\n\"How can that be done?\" asked Dorothy.\n\nThe Wizard looked thoughtfully around his little party and his face grew\ntroubled.\n\n\"It's a pretty high wall,\" he sadly remarked. \"I'm pretty sure the\nCowardly Lion could not leap over it.\"\n\n\"I'm sure of that, too!\" said the Lion with a shudder of fear. \"If I\nfoolishly tried such a leap I would be caught on those dreadful spikes.\"\n\n\"I think I could do it, sir,\" said the Frogman, with a bow to the\nWizard. \"It is an up-hill jump, as well as being a high jump, but I'm\nconsidered something of a jumper by my friends in the Yip Country and I\nbelieve a good strong leap will carry me to the other side.\"\n\n\"I'm sure it would,\" agreed the Cookie Cook.\n\n\"Leaping, you know, is a froglike accomplishment,\" continued the\nFrogman, modestly, \"but please tell me what I am to do when I reach the\nother side of the wall.\"\n\n\"You're a brave creature,\" said the Wizard, admiringly. \"Has anyone a\npin?\"\n\nBetsy had one, which she gave him.\n\n\"All you need do,\" said the Wizard to the Frogman, giving him the pin,\n\"is to stick this into the other side of the wall.\"\n\n\"But the wall is of steel!\" exclaimed the big frog.\n\n\"I know; at least, it _seems_ to be steel; but do as I tell you. Stick\nthe pin into the wall and it will disappear.\"\n\nThe Frogman took off his handsome coat and carefully folded it and laid\nit on the grass. Then he removed his hat and laid it, together with his\ngold-headed cane, beside the coat. He then went back a way and made\nthree powerful leaps, in rapid succession. The first two leaps took him\nto the wall and the third leap carried him well over it, to the\namazement of all. For a short time he disappeared from their view, but\nwhen he had obeyed the Wizard's injunction and had thrust the pin into\nthe wall, the huge barrier vanished and showed them the form of the\nFrogman, who now went to where his coat lay and put it on again.\n\n\"We thank you very much,\" said the delighted Wizard. \"That was the most\nwonderful leap I ever saw and it has saved us from defeat by our enemy.\nLet us now hurry on to the castle before Ugu the Shoemaker thinks of\nsome other means to stop us.\"\n\n\"We must have surprised him, so far,\" declared Dorothy.\n\n\"Yes, indeed. The fellow knows a lot of magic--all of our tricks and\nsome of his own,\" replied the Wizard. \"So, if he is half as clever as he\nought to be, we shall have trouble with him yet.\"\n\nHe had scarcely spoken these words when out from the gates of the wicker\ncastle marched a regiment of soldiers, clad in gay uniforms and all\nbearing long, pointed spears and sharp battle-axes. These soldiers were\ngirls, and the uniforms were short skirts of yellow and black satin,\ngolden shoes, bands of gold across their foreheads and necklaces of\nglittering jewels. Their jackets were scarlet, braided with silver\ncords. There were hundreds of these girl-soldiers, and they were more\nterrible than beautiful, being strong and fierce in appearance. They\nformed a circle all around the castle and faced outward, their spears\npointed toward the invaders and their battle-axes held over their\nshoulders, ready to strike.\n\nOf course our friends halted at once, for they had not expected this\ndreadful array of soldiery. The Wizard seemed puzzled and his companions\nexchanged discouraged looks.\n\n\"I'd no idea Ugu had such an army as that,\" said Dorothy. \"The castle\ndoesn't look big enough to hold them all.\"\n\n\"It isn't,\" declared the Wizard.\n\n\"But they all marched out of it.\"\n\n\"They seemed to; but I don't believe it is a real army at all. If Ugu\nthe Shoemaker had so many people living with him, I'm sure the Czarover\nof Herku would have mentioned the fact to us.\"\n\n\"They're only girls!\" laughed Scraps.\n\n\"Girls are the fiercest soldiers of all,\" declared the Frogman. \"They\nare more brave than men and they have better nerves. That is probably\nwhy the magician uses them for soldiers and has sent them to oppose us.\"\n\nNo one argued this statement, for all were staring hard at the line of\nsoldiers, which now, having taken a defiant position, remained\nmotionless.\n\n\"Here is a trick of magic new to me,\" admitted the Wizard, after a time.\n\"I do not believe the army is real, but the spears may be sharp enough\nto prick us, nevertheless, so we must be cautious. Let us take time to\nconsider how to meet this difficulty.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWhile they were thinking it over Scraps danced closer to the line of\ngirl soldiers. Her button eyes sometimes saw more than did the natural\neyes of her comrades and so, after staring hard at the magician's army,\nshe boldly advanced and danced right through the threatening line! On\nthe other side she waved her stuffed arms and called out:\n\n\"Come on, folks. The spears can't hurt you.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said the Wizard, gayly, \"an optical illusion, as I thought. Let us\nall follow the Patchwork Girl.\"\n\nThe three little girls were somewhat nervous in attempting to brave the\nspears and battle-axes, but after the others had safely passed the line\nthey ventured to follow. And, when all had passed through the ranks of\nthe girl army, the army itself magically disappeared from view.\n\nAll this time our friends had been getting farther up the hill and\nnearer to the wicker castle. Now, continuing their advance, they\nexpected something else to oppose their way, but to their astonishment\nnothing happened and presently they arrived at the wicker gates, which\nstood wide open, and boldly entered the domain of Ugu the Shoemaker.\n\n\n\n\nIn the Wicker Castle\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 22\n\n\nNo sooner were the Wizard of Oz and his followers well within the castle\nentrance when the big gates swung to with a clang and heavy bars dropped\nacross them. They looked at one another uneasily, but no one cared to\nspeak of the incident. If they were indeed prisoners in the wicker\ncastle it was evident they must find a way to escape, but their first\nduty was to attend to the errand on which they had come and seek the\nRoyal Ozma, whom they believed to be a prisoner of the magician, and\nrescue her.\n\nThey found they had entered a square courtyard, from which an entrance\nled into the main building of the castle. No person had appeared to\ngreet them, so far, although a gaudy peacock, perched upon the wall,\ncackled with laughter and said in its sharp, shrill voice: \"Poor fools!\nPoor fools!\"\n\n\"I hope the peacock is mistaken,\" remarked the Frogman, but no one else\npaid any attention to the bird. They were a little awed by the stillness\nand loneliness of the place.\n\nAs they entered the doors of the castle, which stood invitingly open,\nthese also closed behind them and huge bolts shot into place. The\nanimals had all accompanied the party into the castle, because they felt\nit would be dangerous for them to separate. They were forced to follow a\nzigzag passage, turning this way and that, until finally they entered a\ngreat central hall, circular in form and with a high dome from which was\nsuspended an enormous chandelier.\n\nThe Wizard went first, and Dorothy, Betsy and Trot followed him, Toto\nkeeping at the heels of his little mistress. Then came the Lion, the\nWoozy and the Sawhorse; then Cayke the Cookie Cook and Button-Bright;\nthen the Lavender Bear carrying the Pink Bear, and finally the Frogman\nand the Patchwork Girl, with Hank the Mule tagging behind. So it was the\nWizard who caught the first glimpse of the big domed hall, but the\nothers quickly followed and gathered in a wondering group just within\nthe entrance.\n\nUpon a raised platform at one side was a heavy table on which lay\nGlinda's Great Book of Records; but the platform was firmly fastened to\nthe floor and the table was fastened to the platform and the Book was\nchained fast to the table--just as it had been when it was kept in\nGlinda's palace. On the wall over the table hung Ozma's Magic Picture.\nOn a row of shelves at the opposite side of the hall stood all the\nchemicals and essences of magic and all the magical instruments that had\nbeen stolen from Glinda and Ozma and the Wizard, with glass doors\ncovering the shelves so that no one could get at them.\n\nAnd in a far corner sat Ugu the Shoemaker, his feet lazily extended, his\nskinny hands clasped behind his head. He was leaning back at his ease\nand calmly smoking a long pipe. Around the magician was a sort of cage,\nseemingly made of golden bars set wide apart, and at his feet--also\nwithin the cage--reposed the long-sought diamond-studded dishpan of\nCayke the Cookie Cook.\n\nPrincess Ozma of Oz was nowhere to be seen.\n\n\"Well, well,\" said Ugu, when the invaders had stood in silence for a\nmoment, staring about them, \"this visit is an expected pleasure, I\nassure you. I knew you were coming and I know why you are here. You are\nnot welcome, for I cannot use any of you to my advantage, but as you\nhave insisted on coming I hope you will make the afternoon call as brief\nas possible. It won't take long to transact your business with me. You\nwill ask me for Ozma, and my reply will be that you may find her--if you\ncan.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" answered the Wizard, in a tone of rebuke, \"you are a very wicked\nand cruel person. I suppose you imagine, because you have stolen this\npoor woman's dishpan and all the best magic in Oz, that you are more\npowerful than we are and will be able to triumph over us.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Ugu the Shoemaker, slowly filling his pipe with fresh\ntobacco from a silver bowl that stood beside him, \"that is exactly what\nI imagine. It will do you no good to demand from me the girl who was\nformerly the Ruler of Oz, because I will not tell you where I have\nhidden her--and you can't guess in a thousand years. Neither will I\nrestore to you any of the magic I have captured. I am not so foolish.\nBut bear this in mind: I mean to be the Ruler of Oz myself, hereafter,\nso I advise you to be careful how you address your future Monarch.\"\n\n\"Ozma is still Ruler of Oz, wherever you may have hidden her,\" declared\nthe Wizard. \"And bear this in mind, miserable Shoemaker: We intend to\nfind her and to rescue her, in time, but our first duty and pleasure\nwill be to conquer you and then punish you for your misdeeds.\"\n\n\"Very well; go ahead and conquer,\" said Ugu. \"I'd really like to see how\nyou can do it.\"\n\nNow, although the little Wizard had spoken so boldly, he had at the\nmoment no idea how they might conquer the magician. He had that morning\ngiven the Frogman, at his request, a dose of zosozo from his bottle, and\nthe Frogman had promised to fight a good fight if it was necessary; but\nthe Wizard knew that strength alone could not avail against magical\narts. The toy Bear King seemed to have some pretty good magic, however,\nand the Wizard depended to an extent on that. But something ought to be\ndone right away, and the Wizard didn't know what it was.\n\nWhile he considered this perplexing question and the others stood\nlooking at him as their leader, a queer thing happened. The floor of the\ngreat circular hall, on which they were standing, suddenly began to tip.\nInstead of being flat and level it became a slant, and the slant grew\nsteeper and steeper until none of the party could manage to stand upon\nit. Presently they all slid down to the wall, which was now under them,\nand then it became evident that the whole vast room was slowly turning\nupside down! Only Ugu the Shoemaker, kept in place by the bars of his\ngolden cage, remained in his former position, and the wicked magician\nseemed to enjoy the surprise of his victims immensely.\n\nFirst, they all slid down to the wall back of them, but as the room\ncontinued to turn over they next slid down the wall and found themselves\nat the bottom of the great dome, bumping against the big chandelier\nwhich, like everything else, was now upside-down.\n\nThe turning movement now stopped and the room became stationary. Looking\nfar up, they saw Ugu suspended in his cage at the very top, which had\nonce been the floor.\n\n\"Ah,\" said he, grinning down at them, \"the way to conquer is to act, and\nhe who acts promptly is sure to win. This makes a very good prison, from\nwhich I am sure you cannot escape. Please amuse yourselves in any way\nyou like, but I must beg you to excuse me, as I have business in another\npart of my castle.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nSaying this, he opened a trap door in the floor of his cage (which was\nnow over his head) and climbed through it and disappeared from their\nview. The diamond dishpan still remained in the cage, but the bars kept\nit from falling down on their heads.\n\n\"Well, I declare!\" said the Patchwork Girl, seizing one of the bars of\nthe chandelier and swinging from it, \"we must peg one for the Shoemaker,\nfor he has trapped us very cleverly.\"\n\n\"Get off my foot, please,\" said the Lion to the Sawhorse.\n\n\"And oblige me, Mr. Mule,\" remarked the Woozy, \"by taking your tail out\nof my left eye.\"\n\n\"It's rather crowded down here,\" explained Dorothy, \"because the dome is\nrounding and we have all slid into the middle of it. But let us keep as\nquiet as possible until we can think what's best to be done.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear!\" wailed Cayke; \"I wish I had my darling dishpan,\" and she\nheld her arms longingly toward it.\n\n\"I wish I had the magic on those shelves up there,\" sighed the Wizard.\n\n\"Don't you s'pose we could get to it?\" asked Trot anxiously.\n\n\"We'd have to fly,\" laughed the Patchwork Girl.\n\nBut the Wizard took the suggestion seriously, and so did the Frogman.\nThey talked it over and soon planned an attempt to reach the shelves\nwhere the magical instruments were. First the Frogman lay against the\nrounding dome and braced his foot on the stem of the chandelier; then\nthe Wizard climbed over him and lay on the dome with his feet on the\nFrogman's shoulders; the Cookie Cook came next; then Button-Bright\nclimbed to the woman's shoulders; then Dorothy climbed up, and Betsy and\nTrot, and finally the Patchwork Girl, and all their lengths made a long\nline that reached far up the dome but not far enough for Scraps to touch\nthe shelves.\n\n\"Wait a minute; perhaps I can reach the magic,\" called the Bear King,\nand began scrambling up the bodies of the others. But when he came to\nthe Cookie Cook his soft paws tickled her side so that she squirmed and\nupset the whole line. Down they came, tumbling in a heap against the\nanimals, and although no one was much hurt it was a bad mix-up and the\nFrogman, who was at the bottom, almost lost his temper before he could\nget on his feet again.\n\nCayke positively refused to try what she called \"the pyramid act\" again,\nand as the Wizard was now convinced they could not reach the magic tools\nin that manner the attempt was abandoned.\n\n\"But _something_ must be done,\" said the Wizard, and then he turned to\nthe Lavender Bear and asked: \"Cannot Your Majesty's magic help us to\nescape from here?\"\n\n\"My magic powers are limited,\" was the reply. \"When I was stuffed, the\nfairies stood by and slyly dropped some magic into my stuffing.\nTherefore I can do any of the magic that's inside me, but nothing else.\nYou, however, are a wizard, and a wizard should be able to do anything.\"\n\n\"Your Majesty forgets that my tools of magic have been stolen,\" said the\nWizard sadly, \"and a wizard without tools is as helpless as a carpenter\nwithout a hammer or saw.\"\n\n\"Don't give up,\" pleaded Button-Bright, \"'cause if we can't get out of\nthis queer prison we'll all starve to death.\"\n\n\"Not I!\" laughed the Patchwork Girl, now standing on top the chandelier,\nat the place that was meant to be the bottom of it.\n\n\"Don't talk of such dreadful things,\" said Trot, shuddering. \"We came\nhere to capture the Shoemaker, didn't we?\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"And here we are, captured ourselves, and my darling dishpan up there in\nplain sight!\" wailed the Cookie Cook, wiping her eyes on the tail of the\nFrogman's coat.\n\n\"Hush!\" called the Lion, with a low, deep growl. \"Give the Wizard time\nto think.\"\n\n\"He has plenty of time,\" said Scraps. \"What he needs is the Scarecrow's\nbrains.\"\n\nAfter all, it was little Dorothy who came to their rescue, and her\nability to save them was almost as much a surprise to the girl as it was\nto her friends. Dorothy had been secretly testing the powers of her\nMagic Belt, which she had once captured from the Nome King, and\nexperimenting with it in various ways, ever since she had started on\nthis eventful journey. At different times she had stolen away from the\nothers of her party and in solitude had tried to find out what the Magic\nBelt could do and what it could not do. There were a lot of things it\ncould not do, she discovered, but she learned some things about the Belt\nwhich even her girl friends did not suspect she knew.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nFor one thing, she had remembered that when the Nome King owned it the\nMagic Belt used to perform transformations, and by thinking hard she had\nfinally recalled the way in which such transformations had been\naccomplished. Better than this, however, was the discovery that the\nMagic Belt would grant its wearer one wish a day. All she need do was\nclose her right eye and wiggle her left toe and then draw a long breath\nand make her wish. Yesterday she had wished in secret for a box of\ncaramels, and instantly found the box beside her. To-day she had saved\nher daily wish, in case she might need it in an emergency, and the time\nhad now come when she must use the wish to enable her to escape with her\nfriends from the prison in which Ugu had caught them.\n\nSo, without telling anyone what she intended to do--for she had only\nused the wish once and could not be certain how powerful the Magic Belt\nmight be--Dorothy closed her right eye and wiggled her left big toe and\ndrew a long breath and wished with all her might. The next moment the\nroom began to revolve again, as slowly as before, and by degrees they\nall slid to the side wall and down the wall to the floor--all but\nScraps, who was so astonished that she still clung to the chandelier.\nWhen the big hall was in its proper position again and the others stood\nfirmly upon the floor of it, they looked far up to the dome and saw the\nPatchwork Girl swinging from the chandelier.\n\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Dorothy. \"How ever will you get down?\"\n\n\"Won't the room keep turning?\" asked Scraps.\n\n\"I hope not. I believe it has stopped for good,\" said Princess Dorothy.\n\n\"Then stand from under, so you won't get hurt!\" shouted the Patchwork\nGirl, and as soon as they had obeyed this request she let go the\nchandelier and came tumbling down heels over head and twisting and\nturning in a very exciting manner. Plump! she fell on the tiled floor\nand they ran to her and rolled her and patted her into shape again.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nThe Defiance of Ugu the Shoemaker\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 23\n\n\nThe delay caused by Scraps had prevented anyone from running to the\nshelves to secure the magic instruments so badly needed. Even Cayke\nneglected to get her diamond-studded dishpan because she was watching\nthe Patchwork Girl. And now the magician had opened his trap door and\nappeared in his golden cage again, frowning angrily because his\nprisoners had been able to turn their upside-down prison right-side-up.\n\n\"Which of you has dared defy my magic?\" he shouted in a terrible voice.\n\n\"It was I,\" answered Dorothy calmly.\n\n\"Then I shall destroy you, for you are only an Earth girl and no fairy,\"\nhe said, and began to mumble some magic words.\n\nDorothy now realized that Ugu must be treated as an enemy, so she\nadvanced toward the corner in which he sat, saying as she went:\n\n\"I am not afraid of you, Mr. Shoemaker, and I think you'll be sorry,\npretty soon, that you're such a bad man. You can't destroy me and I\nwon't destroy you, but I'm going to punish you for your wickedness.\"\n\nUgu laughed a laugh that was not nice to hear, and then he waved his\nhand. Dorothy was halfway across the room when suddenly a wall of glass\nrose before her and stopped her progress. Through the glass she could\nsee the magician sneering at her because she was a weak little girl, and\nthis provoked her. Although the glass wall obliged her to halt she\ninstantly pressed both hands to her Magic Belt and cried in a loud\nvoice:\n\n\"Ugu the Shoemaker, by the magic virtues of the Magic Belt, I command\nyou to become a dove!\"\n\nThe magician instantly realized he was being enchanted, for he could\nfeel his form changing. He struggled desperately against the\nenchantment, mumbling magic words and making magic passes with his\nhands. And in one way he succeeded in defeating Dorothy's purpose, for\nwhile his form soon changed to that of a gray dove, the dove was of an\nenormous size--bigger even than Ugu had been as a man--and this feat he\nhad been able to accomplish before his powers of magic wholly deserted\nhim.\n\nAnd the dove was not gentle, as doves usually are, for Ugu was terribly\nenraged at the little girl's success. His books had told him nothing of\nthe Nome King's Magic Belt, the Country of the Nomes being outside the\nLand of Oz. He knew, however, that he was likely to be conquered unless\nhe made a fierce fight, so he spread his wings and rose in the air and\nflew directly toward Dorothy. The Wall of Glass had disappeared the\ninstant Ugu became transformed.\n\nDorothy had meant to command the Belt to transform the magician into a\nDove of Peace, but in her excitement she forgot to say more than \"dove,\"\nand now Ugu was not a Dove of Peace by any means, but rather a spiteful\nDove of War. His size made his sharp beak and claws very dangerous, but\nDorothy was not afraid when he came darting toward her with his talons\noutstretched and his sword-like beak open.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nShe knew the Magic Belt would protect its wearer from harm.\n\nBut the Frogman did not know that fact and became alarmed at the little\ngirl's seeming danger. So he gave a sudden leap and leaped full upon the\nback of the great dove.\n\nThen began a desperate struggle. The dove was as strong as Ugu had been,\nand in size it was considerably bigger than the Frogman. But the Frogman\nhad eaten the zosozo and it had made him fully as strong as Ugu the\nDove. At the first leap he bore the dove to the floor, but the giant\nbird got free and began to bite and claw the Frogman, beating him down\nwith its great wings whenever he attempted to rise. The thick, tough\nskin of the big frog was not easily damaged, but Dorothy feared for her\nchampion and by again using the transformation power of the Magic Belt\nshe made the dove grow small, until it was no larger than a canary bird.\n\nUgu had not lost his knowledge of magic when he lost his shape as a man,\nand he now realized it was hopeless to oppose the power of the Magic\nBelt and knew that his only hope of escape lay in instant action. So he\nquickly flew into the golden jeweled dishpan he had stolen from Cayke\nthe Cookie Cook and, as birds can talk as well as beasts or men in the\nFairyland of Oz, he muttered the magic word that was required and wished\nhimself in the Country of the Quadlings--which was as far away from the\nwicker castle as he believed he could get.\n\nOur friends did not know, of course, what Ugu was about to do. They saw\nthe dishpan tremble an instant and then disappear, the dove disappearing\nwith it, and although they waited expectantly for some minutes for the\nmagician's return, Ugu did not come back again.\n\n\"Seems to me,\" said the Wizard in a cheerful voice, \"that we have\nconquered the wicked magician more quickly than we expected to.\"\n\n\"Don't say 'we'--Dorothy did it!\" cried the Patchwork Girl, turning\nthree somersaults in succession and then walking around on her hands.\n\"Hurrah for Dorothy!\"\n\n\"I thought you said you did not know how to use the magic of the Nome\nKing's Belt,\" said the Wizard to Dorothy.\n\n\"I didn't know, at that time,\" she replied, \"but afterward I remembered\nhow the Nome King once used the Magic Belt to enchant people and\ntransform 'em into ornaments and all sorts of things; so I tried some\nenchantments in secret and after awhile I transformed the Sawhorse into\na potato-masher and back again, and the Cowardly Lion into a pussycat\nand back again, and then I knew the thing would work all right.\"\n\n\"When did you perform those enchantments?\" asked the Wizard, much\nsurprised.\n\n\"One night when all the rest of you were asleep but Scraps, and she had\ngone chasing moonbeams.\"\n\n\"Well,\" remarked the Wizard, \"your discovery has certainly saved us a\nlot of trouble, and we must all thank the Frogman, too, for making such\na good fight. The dove's shape had Ugu's evil disposition inside it, and\nthat made the monster bird dangerous.\"\n\nThe Frogman was looking sad because the bird's talons had torn his\npretty clothes, but he bowed with much dignity at this well-deserved\npraise. Cayke, however, had squatted on the floor and was sobbing\nbitterly.\n\n\"My precious dishpan is gone!\" she wailed. \"Gone, just as I had found it\nagain!\"\n\n\"Never mind,\" said Trot, trying to comfort her, \"it's sure to be\n_some_where, so we'll cert'nly run across it some day.\"\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" added Betsy; \"now that we have Ozma's Magic Picture, we\ncan tell just where the Dove went with your dishpan.\"\n\nThey all approached the Magic Picture, and Dorothy wished it to show the\nenchanted form of Ugu the Shoemaker, wherever it might be. At once there\nappeared in the frame of the Picture a scene in the far Quadling\nCountry, where the Dove was perched disconsolately on the limb of a tree\nand the jeweled dishpan lay on the ground just underneath the limb.\n\n\"But where is the place--how far or how near?\" asked Cayke anxiously.\n\n\"The Book of Records will tell us that,\" answered the Wizard. So they\nlooked in the Great Book and read the following:\n\n     \"Ugu the Magician, being transformed into a dove by Princess\n     Dorothy of Oz, has used the magic of the golden dishpan to carry\n     him instantly to the northeast corner of the Quadling Country.\"\n\n\"That's all right,\" said Dorothy. \"Don't worry, Cayke, for the Scarecrow\nand the Tin Woodman are in that part of the country, looking for Ozma,\nand they'll surely find your dishpan.\"\n\n\"Good gracious!\" exclaimed Button-Bright, \"we've forgot all about Ozma.\nLet's find out where the magician hid her.\"\n\nBack to the Magic Picture they trooped, but when they wished to see\nOzma, wherever she might be hidden, only a round black spot appeared in\nthe center of the canvas.\n\n\"I don't see how _that_ can be Ozma!\" said Dorothy, much puzzled.\n\n\"It seems to be the best the Magic Picture can do, however,\" said the\nWizard, no less surprised. \"If it's an enchantment, it looks as if the\nmagician had transformed Ozma into a chunk of pitch.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nThe Little Pink Bear Speaks Truly\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 24\n\n\nFor several minutes they all stood staring at the black spot on the\ncanvas of the Magic Picture, wondering what it could mean.\n\n\"P'r'aps we'd better ask the little Pink Bear about Ozma,\" suggested\nTrot.\n\n\"Pshaw!\" said Button-Bright, \"_he_ don't know anything.\"\n\n\"He never makes a mistake,\" declared the King.\n\n\"He did once, surely,\" said Betsy. \"But perhaps he wouldn't make a\nmistake again.\"\n\n\"He won't have the chance,\" grumbled the Bear King.\n\n\"We might hear what he has to say,\" said Dorothy. \"It won't do any harm\nto ask the Pink Bear where Ozma is.\"\n\n\"I will not have him questioned,\" declared the King, in a surly voice.\n\"I do not intend to allow my little Pink Bear to be again insulted by\nyour foolish doubts. He never makes a mistake.\"\n\n\"Didn't he say Ozma was in that hole in the ground?\" asked Betsy.\n\n\"He did; and I am certain she was there,\" replied the Lavender Bear.\n\nScraps laughed jeeringly and the others saw there was no use arguing\nwith the stubborn Bear King, who seemed to have absolute faith in his\nPink Bear. The Wizard, who knew that magical things can usually be\ndepended upon, and that the little Pink Bear was able to answer\nquestions by some remarkable power of magic, thought it wise to\napologize to the Lavender Bear for the unbelief of his friends, at the\nsame time urging the King to consent to question the Pink Bear once\nmore. Cayke and the Frogman also pleaded with the big Bear, who\nfinally agreed, although rather ungraciously, to put the little Bear's\nwisdom to the test once more. So he sat the little one on his knee and\nturned the crank and the Wizard himself asked the questions in a very\nrespectful tone of voice.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Where is Ozma?\" was his first query.\n\n\"Here, in this room,\" answered the little Pink Bear.\n\nThey all looked around the room, but of course did not see her.\n\n\"In what part of this room is she?\" was the Wizard's next question.\n\n\"In Button-Bright's pocket,\" said the little Pink Bear.\n\nThis reply amazed them all, you may be sure, and although the three\ngirls smiled and Scraps yelled: \"Hoo-ray!\" in derision, the Wizard\nseemed to consider the matter with grave thoughtfulness.\n\n\"In which one of Button-Bright's pockets is Ozma?\" he presently\ninquired.\n\n\"In the lefthand jacket-pocket,\" said the little Pink Bear.\n\n\"The pink one has gone crazy!\" exclaimed Button-Bright, staring hard at\nthe little bear on the big bear's knee.\n\n\"I am not so sure of that,\" declared the Wizard. \"If Ozma proves to be\nreally in your pocket, then the little Pink Bear spoke truly when he\nsaid Ozma was in that hole in the ground. For at that time you were also\nin the hole, and after we had pulled you out of it the little Pink Bear\nsaid Ozma was not in the hole.\"\n\n\"He never makes a mistake,\" asserted the Bear King, stoutly.\n\n\"Empty that pocket, Button-Bright, and let's see what's in it,\"\nrequested Dorothy.\n\nSo Button-Bright laid the contents of his left jacket-pocket on the\ntable. These proved to be a peg-top, a bunch of string, a small rubber\nball and a golden peach-pit.\n\n\"What's this?\" asked the Wizard, picking up the peach-pit and examining\nit closely.\n\n\"Oh,\" said the boy, \"I saved that to show to the girls, and then forgot\nall about it. It came out of a lonesome peach that I found in the\norchard back yonder, and which I ate while I was lost. It looks like\ngold, and I never saw a peach-pit like it before.\"\n\n\"Nor I,\" said the Wizard, \"and that makes it seem suspicious.\"\n\nAll heads were bent over the golden peach-pit. The Wizard turned it over\nseveral times and then took out his pocket-knife and pried the pit\nopen.\n\nAs the two halves fell apart a pink, cloud-like haze came pouring from\nthe golden peach-pit, almost filling the big room, and from the haze a\nform took shape and settled beside them. Then, as the haze faded away, a\nsweet voice said: \"Thank you, my friends!\" and there before them stood\ntheir lovely girl Ruler, Ozma of Oz.\n\nWith a cry of delight Dorothy rushed forward and embraced her. Scraps\nturned gleeful flip-flops all around the room. Button-Bright gave a low\nwhistle of astonishment. The Frogman took off his tall hat and bowed low\nbefore the beautiful girl who had been freed from her enchantment in so\nstartling a manner.\n\nFor a time no sound was heard beyond the low murmur of delight that came\nfrom the amazed group, but presently the growl of the big Lavender Bear\ngrew louder and he said in a tone of triumph:\n\n\"He never makes a mistake!\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nOzma of Oz\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 25\n\n\n\"It's funny,\" said Toto, standing before his friend the Lion and wagging\nhis tail, \"but I've found my growl at last! I am positive, now, that it\nwas the cruel magician who stole it.\"\n\n\"Let's hear your growl,\" requested the Lion.\n\n\"Gr-r-r-r-r-r!\" said Toto.\n\n\"That is fine,\" declared the big beast. \"It isn't as loud or as deep as\nthe growl of the big Lavender Bear, but it is a very respectable growl\nfor a small dog. Where did you find it, Toto?\"\n\n\"I was smelling in the corner, yonder,\" said Toto, \"when suddenly a\nmouse ran out--and I growled!\"\n\nThe others were all busy congratulating Ozma, who was very happy at\nbeing released from the confinement of the golden peach-pit, where the\nmagician had placed her with the notion that she never could be found or\nliberated.\n\n\"And only to think,\" cried Dorothy, \"that Button-Bright has been\ncarrying you in his pocket all this time, and we never knew it!\"\n\n\"The little Pink Bear told you,\" said the Bear King, \"but you wouldn't\nbelieve him.\"\n\n\"Never mind, my dears,\" said Ozma graciously; \"all is well that ends\nwell, and you couldn't be expected to know I was inside the peach-pit.\nIndeed, I feared I would remain a captive much longer than I did, for\nUgu is a bold and clever magician and he had hidden me very securely.\"\n\n\"You were in a fine peach,\" said Button-Bright; \"the best I ever ate.\"\n\n\"The magician was foolish to make the peach so tempting,\" remarked the\nWizard; \"but Ozma would lend beauty to any transformation.\"\n\n\"How did you manage to conquer Ugu the Shoemaker?\" inquired the girl\nRuler of Oz.\n\nDorothy started to tell the story and Trot helped her, and Button-Bright\nwanted to relate it in his own way, and the Wizard tried to make it\nclear to Ozma, and Betsy had to remind them of important things they\nleft out, and all together there was such a chatter that it was a wonder\nthat Ozma understood any of it. But she listened patiently, with a smile\non her lovely face at their eagerness, and presently had gleaned all the\ndetails of their adventures.\n\nOzma thanked the Frogman very earnestly for his assistance and she\nadvised Cayke the Cookie Cook to dry her weeping eyes, for she promised\nto take her to the Emerald City and see that her cherished dishpan was\nrestored to her. Then the beautiful Ruler took a chain of emeralds from\naround her own neck and placed it around the neck of the little Pink\nBear.\n\n\"Your wise answers to the questions of my friends,\" said she, \"helped\nthem to rescue me. Therefore I am deeply grateful to you and to your\nnoble King.\"\n\nThe bead eyes of the little Pink Bear stared unresponsive to this praise\nuntil the Big Lavender Bear turned the crank in its side, when it said\nin its squeaky voice:\n\n\"I thank Your Majesty.\"\n\n\"For my part,\" returned the Bear King, \"I realize that you were well\nworth saving, Miss Ozma, and so I am much pleased that we could be of\nservice to you. By means of my Magic Wand I have been creating exact\nimages of your Emerald City and your Royal Palace, and I must confess\nthat they are more attractive than any places I have ever seen--not\nexcepting Bear Center.\"\n\n\"I would like to entertain you in my palace,\" returned Ozma, sweetly,\n\"and you are welcome to return with me and to make me a long visit, if\nyour bear subjects can spare you from your own kingdom.\"\n\n\"As for that,\" answered the King, \"my kingdom causes me little worry,\nand I often find it somewhat tame and uninteresting. Therefore I am in\nno hurry to return to it and will be glad to accept your kind\ninvitation. Corporal Waddle may be trusted to care for my bears in my\nabsence.\"\n\n\"And you'll bring the little Pink Bear?\" asked Dorothy eagerly.\n\n\"Of course, my dear; I would not willingly part with him.\"\n\nThey remained in the wicker castle for three days, carefully packing all\nthe magical things that had been stolen by Ugu and also taking whatever\nin the way of magic the shoemaker had inherited from his ancestors.\n\n\"For,\" said Ozma, \"I have forbidden any of my subjects except Glinda the\nGood and the Wizard of Oz to practice magical arts, because they cannot\nbe trusted to do good and not harm. Therefore Ugu must never again be\npermitted to work magic of any sort.\"\n\n\"Well,\" remarked Dorothy cheerfully, \"a dove can't do much in the way of\nmagic, anyhow, and I'm going to keep Ugu in the form of a dove until he\nreforms and becomes a good and honest shoemaker.\"\n\nWhen everything was packed and loaded on the backs of the animals, they\nset out for the river, taking a more direct route than that by which\nCayke and the Frogman had come. In this way they avoided the Cities of\nThi and Herku and Bear Center and after a pleasant journey reached the\nWinkie River and found a jolly ferryman who had a fine big boat and was\nwilling to carry the entire party by water to a place quite near to the\nEmerald City.\n\nThe river had many windings and many branches, and the journey did not\nend in a day, but finally the boat floated into a pretty lake which was\nbut a short distance from Ozma's home. Here the jolly ferryman was\nrewarded for his labors and then the entire party set out in a grand\nprocession to march to the Emerald City.\n\nNews that the Royal Ozma had been found spread quickly throughout the\nneighborhood and both sides of the road soon became lined with loyal\nsubjects of the beautiful and beloved Ruler. Therefore Ozma's ears heard\nlittle but cheers and her eyes beheld little else than waving\nhandkerchiefs and banners during all the triumphal march from the lake\nto the city's gates.\n\nAnd there she met a still greater concourse, for all the inhabitants of\nthe Emerald City turned out to welcome her return and several bands\nplayed gay music and all the houses were decorated with flags and\nbunting and never before were the people so joyous and happy as at this\nmoment when they welcomed home their girl Ruler. For she had been lost\nand was now found again, and surely that was cause for rejoicing.\n\nGlinda was at the royal palace to meet the returning party and the good\nSorceress was indeed glad to have her Great Book of Records returned to\nher, as well as all the precious collection of magic instruments and\nelixirs and chemicals that had been stolen from her castle. Cap'n Bill\nand the Wizard at once hung the Magic Picture upon the wall of Ozma's\nboudoir and the Wizard was so light-hearted that he did several tricks\nwith the tools in his black bag to amuse his companions and prove that\nonce again he was a powerful wizard.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nFor a whole week there was feasting and merriment and all sorts of\njoyous festivities at the palace, in honor of Ozma's safe return. The\nLavender Bear and the little Pink Bear received much attention and were\nhonored by all, much to the Bear King's satisfaction. The Frogman\nspeedily became a favorite at the Emerald City and the Shaggy Man and\nTik-Tok and Jack Pumpkinhead, who had now returned from their search,\nwere very polite to the big frog and made him feel quite at home. Even\nthe Cookie Cook, because she was a stranger and Ozma's guest, was shown\nas much deference as if she had been a queen.\n\n\"All the same, Your Majesty,\" said Cayke to Ozma, day after day, with\ntiresome repetition, \"I hope you will soon find my jeweled dishpan, for\nnever can I be quite happy without it.\"\n\n\n\n\nDorothy Forgives\n\n[Illustration]\n\nCHAPTER 26\n\n\nThe gray dove which had once been Ugu the Shoemaker sat on its tree in\nthe far Quadling Country and moped, chirping dismally and brooding over\nits misfortunes. After a time the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman came\nalong and sat beneath the tree, paying no heed to the mutterings of the\ngray dove.\n\nThe Tin Woodman took a small oilcan from his tin pocket and carefully\noiled his tin joints with it. While he was thus engaged the Scarecrow\nremarked:\n\n\"I feel much better, dear comrade, since we found that heap of nice\nclean straw and you stuffed me anew with it.\"\n\n\"And I feel much better now that my joints are oiled,\" returned the Tin\nWoodman, with a sigh of pleasure. \"You and I, friend Scarecrow, are much\nmore easily cared for than those clumsy meat people, who spend half\ntheir time dressing in fine clothes and who must live in splendid\ndwellings in order to be contented and happy. You and I do not eat, and\nso we are spared the dreadful bother of getting three meals a day. Nor\ndo we waste half our lives in sleep, a condition that causes the meat\npeople to lose all consciousness and become as thoughtless and helpless\nas logs of wood.\"\n\n\"You speak truly,\" responded the Scarecrow, tucking some wisps of straw\ninto his breast with his padded fingers. \"I often feel sorry for the\nmeat people, many of whom are my friends. Even the beasts are happier\nthan they, for they require less to make them content. And the birds are\nthe luckiest creatures of all, for they can fly swiftly where they will\nand find a home at any place they care to perch; their food consists of\nseeds and grains they gather from the fields and their drink is a sip\nof water from some running brook. If I could not be a Scarecrow--or a\nTin Woodman--my next choice would be to live as a bird does.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nThe gray dove had listened carefully to this speech and seemed to find\ncomfort in it, for it hushed its moaning. And just then the Tin Woodman\ndiscovered Cayke's dishpan, which was on the ground quite near to him.\n\n\"Here is a rather pretty utensil,\" he said, taking it in his tin hands\nto examine it, \"but I would not care to own it. Whoever fashioned it of\ngold and covered it with diamonds did not add to its usefulness, nor do\nI consider it as beautiful as the bright dishpans of tin one usually\nsees. No yellow color is ever so handsome as the silver sheen of tin,\"\nand he turned to look at his tin legs and body with approval.\n\n\"I cannot quite agree with you there,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"My straw\nstuffing has a light yellow color, and it is not only pretty to look at\nbut it crunkles most delightfully when I move.\"\n\n\"Let us admit that all colors are good in their proper places,\" said the\nTin Woodman, who was too kind-hearted to quarrel; \"but you must agree\nwith me that a dishpan that is yellow is unnatural. What shall we do\nwith this one, which we have just found?\"\n\n\"Let us carry it back to the Emerald City,\" suggested the Scarecrow.\n\"Some of our friends might like to have it for a foot-bath, and in using\nit that way its golden color and sparkling ornaments would not injure\nits usefulness.\"\n\nSo they went away and took the jeweled dishpan with them. And, after\nwandering through the country for a day or so longer, they learned the\nnews that Ozma had been found. Therefore they straightway returned to\nthe Emerald City and presented the dishpan to Princess Ozma as a token\nof their joy that she had been restored to them.\n\nOzma promptly gave the diamond-studded gold dishpan to Cayke the Cookie\nCook, who was so delighted at regaining her lost treasure that she\ndanced up and down in glee and then threw her skinny arms around Ozma's\nneck and kissed her gratefully. Cayke's mission was now successfully\naccomplished, but she was having such a good time at the Emerald City\nthat she seemed in no hurry to go back to the Country of the Yips.\n\nIt was several weeks after the dishpan had been restored to the Cookie\nCook when one day, as Dorothy was seated in the royal gardens with Trot\nand Betsy beside her, a gray dove came flying down and alighted at the\ngirl's feet.\n\n\"I am Ugu the Shoemaker,\" said the dove in a soft, mourning voice, \"and\nI have come to ask you to forgive me for the great wrong I did in\nstealing Ozma and the magic that belonged to her and to others.\"\n\n\"Are you sorry, then?\" asked Dorothy, looking hard at the bird.\n\n\"I am _very_ sorry,\" declared Ugu. \"I've been thinking over my misdeeds\nfor a long time, for doves have little else to do but think, and I'm\nsurprised that I was such a wicked man and had so little regard for the\nrights of others. I am now convinced that even had I succeeded in making\nmyself ruler of all Oz I should not have been happy, for many days of\nquiet thought have shown me that only those things one acquires honestly\nare able to render one content.\"\n\n\"I guess that's so,\" said Trot.\n\n\"Anyhow,\" said Betsy, \"the bad man seems truly sorry, and if he has now\nbecome a good and honest man we ought to forgive him.\"\n\n\"I fear I cannot become a good _man_ again,\" said Ugu, \"for the\ntransformation I am under will always keep me in the form of a dove.\nBut, with the kind forgiveness of my former enemies, I hope to become a\nvery good dove, and highly respected.\"\n\n\"Wait here till I run for my Magic Belt,\" said Dorothy, \"and I'll\ntransform you back to your reg'lar shape in a jiffy.\"\n\n\"No--don't do that!\" pleaded the dove, fluttering its wings in an\nexcited way. \"I only want your forgiveness; I don't want to be a man\nagain. As Ugu the Shoemaker I was skinny and old and unlovely; as a dove\nI am quite pretty to look at. As a man I was ambitious and cruel, while\nas a dove I can be content with my lot and happy in my simple life. I\nhave learned to love the free and independent life of a bird and I'd\nrather not change back.\"\n\n\"Just as you like, Ugu,\" said Dorothy, resuming her seat. \"Perhaps you\nare right, for you're cert'nly a better dove than you were a man, and if\nyou should ever backslide, an' feel wicked again, you couldn't do much\nharm as a gray dove.\"\n\n\"Then you forgive me for all the trouble I caused you?\" he asked\nearnestly.\n\n\"Of course; anyone who's sorry just _has_ to be forgiven.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" said the gray dove, and flew away again.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LOST PRINCESS OF OZ***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 24459.txt or 24459.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/2\/4\/4\/5\/24459\n\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/pglaf.\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":561,"split":"train"}
