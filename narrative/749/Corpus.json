{"ori_id":"aeb4b0c7cd1faaae70c732656dddcbb56bf19b99","title":"The Grand Babylon Hotel","context":"The Grand Babylon Hotel\n The protagonists are an American millionaire, Theodore Racksole, and his daughter Nella (Helen). While staying at the supremely exclusive Grand Babylon Hotel, Nella asks for a steak and Bass beer for dinner, but the order is refused. To get her what she wants Racksole buys the entire hotel, for \u00c2\u0141400,000 \"and a guinea\" (so the previous owner can say that he haggled with the multi-millionaire businessman).\nStrange things are happening in the hotel. First, Racksole notices the headwaiter, Jules, winking at his daughter's friend, Reginald Dimmock, while they consume their expensive steak. He dismisses the headwaiter. The next day Miss Spencer, the pretty, efficient hotel clerk who has been employed there for years, disappears. It appears that she just took her things and left, no one knows when or where. And Prince Eugen, a prince regnant of Posen, who was to come to the hotel and meet his youthful uncle Prince Aribert (he and the nephew are of the same age), never turns up. Then the body of Dimmock, who was an equerry to the princes, come ahead to prepare for their visit, is found. He was obviously poisoned. And soon after, Dimmock's body disappears.\nThe same evening the hotel is having a ball in the Gold Room, hosted by a Mr and Mrs Sampson Levi. There is a special secret window though which one can observe the room and the guests. Racksole looks out of it and sees among the guests the dismissed headwaiter, Jules. Racksole runs out to confront him and throw him out, but can't find him. He comes back to the secret window to find Jules, staring intensely into the ball room. Racksole orders him out of the hotel for the second time.\nPrince Aribert, who met Nella in Paris while he was travelling incognito under the name of Count Steenbock, confides the whole story to her. He tells her that Prince Eugen never arrived, and no one knows where he is. He was last seen at Ostend. His Majesty the Emperor sent a telegram to Aribert, requesting the whereabouts of Eugen. Aribert, who does not know whether there might be a secret love affair, or an abduction, is facing a dilemma. At last he decides to go to Berlin and state the facts to the Emperor. Nella promises him help and support in London.\nAfter the departure of Aribert, an old lady signs into the hotel under the name of 'Baroness Zerlinski'. Some chance remarks about hotel rooms convinced Nella, who was substituting for the hotel clerk, that it was, in fact Miss Spencer in disguise. When she finds out that Miss Spencer suddenly checks out and departs for Ostend, Nella too goes to Ostend, leaving a short message for her father as to her whereabouts.\nIn Ostend, Nella follows Miss Spencer into a house, and tries to find out what's going on, threatening the latter with a revolver. Miss Spencer says that she was under orders of Jules, the headwaiter, whose real name is Tom Jackson and who is, she claims, her husband. She says that Jackson\/Jules quarrelled with Dimmock and that he had some \"money business\" with Prince Eugen. She admits that the Prince was a captive in that same house, and she looked after him. He was abducted to prevent him arriving to London, for it would have \"upset the scheme\". Then Miss Spencer fakes a faint, and Nella, who comes nearer to see if she can help her, is overpowered. Nella loses consciousness.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Grand Babylon Hotel, by Arnold\nBennett\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with almost\nno restrictions whatsoever.

It was 7.45 on a particularly sultry June night, and\ndinner was about to be served at the Grand Babylon. Men of all sizes,\nages, and nationalities, but every one alike arrayed in faultless\nevening dress, were dotted about the large, dim apartment. A faint odour\nof flowers came from the conservatory, and the tinkle of a fountain. The\nwaiters, commanded by Jules, moved softly across the thick Oriental\nrugs, balancing their trays with the dexterity of jugglers, and\nreceiving and executing orders with that air of profound importance of\nwhich only really first-class waiters have the secret. The atmosphere\nwas an atmosphere of serenity and repose, characteristic of the Grand\nBabylon. It seemed impossible that anything could occur to mar the\npeaceful, aristocratic monotony of existence in that perfectly-managed\nestablishment. Yet on that night was to happen the mightiest upheaval\nthat the Grand Babylon had ever known.\n\n'Yes, sir?' repeated Jules, and this time there was a shade of august\ndisapproval in his voice: it was not usual for him to have to address a\ncustomer twice.\n\n'Oh!' said the alert, middle-aged man, looking up at length. Beautifully\nignorant of the identity of the great Jules, he allowed his grey eyes to\ntwinkle as he caught sight of the expression on the waiter's face.\n'Bring me an Angel Kiss.'\n\n'Pardon, sir?'\n\n'Bring me an Angel Kiss, and be good enough to lose no time.'\n\n'If it's an American drink, I fear we don't keep it, sir.' The voice of\nJules fell icily distinct, and several men glanced round uneasily, as if\nto deprecate the slightest disturbance of their calm. The appearance of\nthe person to whom Jules was speaking, however, reassured them somewhat,\nfor he had all the look of that expert, the travelled Englishman, who\ncan differentiate between one h\u00c3\u00b4tel and another by instinct, and who\nknows at once where he may make a fuss with propriety, and where it is\nadvisable to behave exactly as at the club. The Grand Babylon was a\nh\u00c3\u00b4tel in whose smoking-room one behaved as though one was at one's club.\n\n'I didn't suppose you did keep it, but you can mix it, I guess, even in\nthis h\u00c3\u00b4tel.'\n\n'This isn't an American h\u00c3\u00b4tel, sir.' The calculated insolence of the\nwords was cleverly masked beneath an accent of humble submission.\n\nThe alert, middle-aged man sat up straight, and gazed placidly at Jules,\nwho was pulling his famous red side-whiskers.\n\n'Get a liqueur glass,' he said, half curtly and half with good-humoured\ntolerance, 'pour into it equal quantities of maraschino, cream, and\ncr\u00c3\u00aame de menthe. Don't stir it; don't shake it. Bring it to me. And, I\nsay, tell the bar-tender--'\n\n'Bar-tender, sir?'\n\n'Tell the bar-tender to make a note of the recipe, as I shall probably\nwant an Angel Kiss every evening before dinner so long as this weather\nlasts.'\n\n'I will send the drink to you, sir,' said Jules distantly. That was his\nparting shot, by which he indicated that he was not as other waiters\nare, and that any person who treated him with disrespect did so at his\nown peril.\n\nA few minutes later, while the alert, middle-aged man was tasting the\nAngel Kiss, Jules sat in conclave with Miss Spencer, who had charge of\nthe bureau of the Grand Babylon. This bureau was a fairly large chamber,\nwith two sliding glass partitions which overlooked the entrance-hall and\nthe smoking-room. Only a small portion of the clerical work of the great\nh\u00c3\u00b4tel was performed there. The place served chiefly as the lair of Miss\nSpencer, who was as well known and as important as Jules himself. Most\nmodern h\u00c3\u00b4tels have a male clerk to superintend the bureau. But the Grand\nBabylon went its own way. Miss Spencer had been bureau clerk almost\nsince the Grand Babylon had first raised its massive chimneys to heaven,\nand she remained in her place despite the vagaries of other h\u00c3\u00b4tels.\nAlways admirably dressed in plain black silk, with a small diamond\nbrooch, immaculate wrist-bands, and frizzed yellow hair, she looked now\njust as she had looked an indefinite number of years ago. Her age--none\nknew it, save herself and perhaps one other, and none cared. The\ngracious and alluring contours of her figure were irreproachable; and in\nthe evenings she was a useful ornament of which any h\u00c3\u00b4tel might be\ninnocently proud. Her knowledge of Bradshaw, of steamship services, and\nthe programmes of theatres and music-halls was unrivalled; yet she never\ntravelled, she never went to a theatre or a music-hall. She seemed to\nspend the whole of her life in that official lair of hers, imparting\ninformation to guests, telephoning to the various departments, or\nengaged in intimate conversations with her special friends on the staff,\nas at present.\n\n'Who's Number 107?' Jules asked this black-robed lady.\n\nMiss Spencer examined her ledgers.\n\n'Mr Theodore Racksole, New York.'\n\n'I thought he must be a New Yorker,' said Jules, after a brief,\nsignificant pause, 'but he talks as good English as you or me. Says he\nwants an \"Angel Kiss\"--maraschino and cream, if you please--every night.\nI'll see he doesn't stop here too long.'\n\nMiss Spencer smiled grimly in response. The notion of referring to\nTheodore Racksole as a 'New Yorker' appealed to her sense of humour, a\nsense in which she was not entirely deficient. She knew, of course, and\nshe knew that Jules knew, that this Theodore Racksole must be the unique\nand only Theodore Racksole, the third richest man in the United States,\nand therefore probably in the world. Nevertheless she ranged herself at\nonce on the side of Jules.\n\nJust as there was only one Racksole, so there was only one Jules, and\nMiss Spencer instinctively shared the latter's indignation at the\nspectacle of any person whatsoever, millionaire or Emperor, presuming to\ndemand an 'Angel Kiss', that unrespectable concoction of maraschino and\ncream, within the precincts of the Grand Babylon. In the world of h\u00c3\u00b4tels\nit was currently stated that, next to the proprietor, there were three\ngods at the Grand Babylon--Jules, the head waiter, Miss Spencer, and,\nmost powerful of all, Rocco, the renowned chef, who earned two thousand\na year, and had a chalet on the Lake of Lucerne. All the great h\u00c3\u00b4tels in\nNorthumberland Avenue and on the Thames Embankment had tried to get\nRocco away from the Grand Babylon, but without success. Rocco was well\naware that even he could rise no higher than the ma\u00c3\u00aetre h\u00c3\u00b4tel of the\nGrand Babylon, which, though it never advertised itself, and didn't\nbelong to a limited company, stood an easy first among the h\u00c3\u00b4tels of\nEurope--first in expensiveness, first in exclusiveness, first in that\nmysterious quality known as 'style'.\n\nSituated on the Embankment, the Grand Babylon, despite its noble\nproportions, was somewhat dwarfed by several colossal neighbours. It had\nbut three hundred and fifty rooms, whereas there are two h\u00c3\u00b4tels within a\nquarter of a mile with six hundred and four hundred rooms respectively.\nOn the other hand, the Grand Babylon was the only h\u00c3\u00b4tel in London with a\ngenuine separate entrance for Royal visitors constantly in use. The\nGrand Babylon counted that day wasted on which it did not entertain, at\nthe lowest, a German prince or the Maharajah of some Indian State. When\nFelix Babylon--after whom, and not with any reference to London's\nnickname, the h\u00c3\u00b4tel was christened--when Felix Babylon founded the h\u00c3\u00b4tel\nin 1869 he had set himself to cater for Royalty, and that was the secret\nof his triumphant eminence.\n\nThe son of a rich Swiss h\u00c3\u00b4tel proprietor and financier, he had contrived\nto established a connection with the officials of several European\nCourts, and he had not spared money in that respect. Sundry kings and\nnot a few princesses called him Felix, and spoke familiarly of the h\u00c3\u00b4tel\nas 'Felix's'; and Felix had found that this was very good for trade. The\nGrand Babylon was managed accordingly. The 'note' of its policy was\ndiscretion, always discretion, and quietude, simplicity, remoteness. The\nplace was like a palace incognito. There was no gold sign over the roof,\nnot even an explanatory word at the entrance. You walked down a small\nside street off the Strand, you saw a plain brown building in front of\nyou, with two mahogany swing doors, and an official behind each; the\ndoors opened noiselessly; you entered; you were in Felix's. If you meant\nto be a guest, you, or your courier, gave your card to Miss Spencer.\nUpon no consideration did you ask for the tariff. It was not good form\nto mention prices at the Grand Babylon; the prices were enormous, but\nyou never mentioned them. At the conclusion of your stay a bill was\npresented, brief and void of dry details, and you paid it without a\nword. You met with a stately civility, that was all. No one had\noriginally asked you to come; no one expressed the hope that you would\ncome again. The Grand Babylon was far above such manoeuvres; it defied\ncompetition by ignoring it; and consequently was nearly always full\nduring the season.\n\nIf there was one thing more than another that annoyed the Grand Babylon-\n-put its back up, so to speak--it was to be compared with, or to be\nmistaken for, an American h\u00c3\u00b4tel. The Grand Babylon was resolutely\nopposed to American methods of eating, drinking, and lodging--but\nespecially American methods of drinking. The resentment of Jules, on\nbeing requested to supply Mr Theodore Racksole with an Angel Kiss, will\ntherefore be appreciated.\n\n'Anybody with Mr Theodore Racksole?' asked Jules, continuing his\nconversation with Miss Spencer. He put a scornful stress on every\nsyllable of the guest's name.\n\n'Miss Racksole--she's in No. 111.'\n\nJules paused, and stroked his left whisker as it lay on his gleaming\nwhite collar.\n\n'She's where?' he queried, with a peculiar emphasis.\n\n'No. 111. I couldn't help it. There was no other room with a bathroom\nand dressing-room on that floor.' Miss Spencer's voice had an appealing\ntone of excuse.\n\n'Why didn't you tell Mr Theodore Racksole and Miss Racksole that we were\nunable to accommodate them?'\n\n'Because Babs was within hearing.'\n\nOnly three people in the wide world ever dreamt of applying to Mr Felix\nBabylon the playful but mean abbreviation--Babs: those three were Jules,\nMiss Spencer, and Rocco. Jules had invented it. No one but he would have\nhad either the wit or the audacity to do so.\n\n'You'd better see that Miss Racksole changes her room to-night,' Jules\nsaid after another pause. 'Leave it to me: I'll fix it. Au revoir! It's\nthree minutes to eight. I shall take charge of the dining-room myself\nto-night.'\n\nAnd Jules departed, rubbing his fine white hands slowly and\nmeditatively. It was a trick of his, to rub his hands with a strange,\nroundabout motion, and the action denoted that some unusual excitement\nwas in the air.\n\nAt eight o'clock precisely dinner was served in the immense salle\nmanger, that chaste yet splendid apartment of white and gold. At a small\ntable near one of the windows a young lady sat alone. Her frocks said\nParis, but her face unmistakably said New York. It was a self-possessed\nand bewitching face, the face of a woman thoroughly accustomed to doing\nexactly what she liked, when she liked, how she liked: the face of a\nwoman who had taught hundreds of gilded young men the true art of\nfetching and carrying, and who, by twenty years or so of parental\nspoiling, had come to regard herself as the feminine equivalent of the\nTsar of All the Russias. Such women are only made in America, and they\nonly come to their full bloom in Europe, which they imagine to be a\ncontinent created by Providence for their diversion.\n\nThe young lady by the window glanced disapprovingly at the menu card.\nThen she looked round the dining-room, and, while admiring the diners,\ndecided that the room itself was rather small and plain. Then she gazed\nthrough the open window, and told herself that though the Thames by\ntwilight was passable enough, it was by no means level with the Hudson,\non whose shores her father had a hundred thousand dollar country\ncottage. Then she returned to the menu, and with a pursing of lovely\nlips said that there appeared to be nothing to eat.\n\n'Sorry to keep you waiting, Nella.' It was Mr Racksole, the intrepid\nmillionaire who had dared to order an Angel Kiss in the smoke-room of\nthe Grand Babylon. Nella--her proper name was Helen--smiled at her\nparent cautiously, reserving to herself the right to scold if she should\nfeel so inclined.\n\n'You always are late, father,' she said.\n\n'Only on a holiday,' he added. 'What is there to eat?'\n\n'Nothing.'\n\n'Then let's have it. I'm hungry. I'm never so hungry as when I'm being\nseriously idle.'\n\n'Consomm\u00c3\u00a9 Britannia,' she began to read out from the menu, 'Saumon\nd'Ecosse, Sauce Genoise, Aspics de Homard. Oh, heavens! Who wants these\nhorrid messes on a night like this?'\n\n'But, Nella, this is the best cooking in Europe,' he protested.\n\n'Say, father,' she said, with seeming irrelevance, 'had you forgotten\nit's my birthday to-morrow?'\n\n'Have I ever forgotten your birthday, O most costly daughter?'\n\n'On the whole you've been a most satisfactory dad,' she answered\nsweetly, 'and to reward you I'll be content this year with the cheapest\nbirthday treat you ever gave me. Only I'll have it to-night.'\n\n'Well,' he said, with the long-suffering patience, the readiness for any\nsurprise, of a parent whom Nella had thoroughly trained, 'what is it?'\n\n'It's this. Let's have filleted steak and a bottle of Bass for dinner\nto-night. It will be simply exquisite. I shall love it.'\n\n'But my dear Nella,' he exclaimed, 'steak and beer at Felix's! It's\nimpossible! Moreover, young women still under twenty-three cannot be\npermitted to drink Bass.'\n\n'I said steak and Bass, and as for being twenty-three, shall be going in\ntwenty-four to-morrow.'\n\nMiss Racksole set her small white teeth.\n\nThere was a gentle cough. Jules stood over them. It must have been out\nof a pure spirit of adventure that he had selected this table for his\nown services. Usually Jules did not personally wait at dinner. He merely\nhovered observant, like a captain on the bridge during the mate's watch.\nRegular frequenters of the h\u00c3\u00b4tel felt themselves honoured when Jules\nattached himself to their tables.\n\nTheodore Racksole hesitated one second, and then issued the order with a\nfine air of carelessness:\n\n'Filleted steak for two, and a bottle of Bass.' It was the bravest act\nof Theodore Racksole's life, and yet at more than one previous crisis a\nhigh courage had not been lacking to him.\n\n'It's not in the menu, sir,' said Jules the imperturbable.\n\n'Never mind. Get it. We want it.'\n\n'Very good, sir.'\n\nJules walked to the service-door, and, merely affecting to look behind,\ncame immediately back again.\n\n'Mr Rocco's compliments, sir, and he regrets to be unable to serve steak\nand Bass to-night, sir.'\n\n'Mr Rocco?' questioned Racksole lightly.\n\n'Mr Rocco,' repeated Jules with firmness.\n\n'And who is Mr Rocco?'\n\n'Mr Rocco is our chef, sir.' Jules had the expression of a man who is\nasked to explain who Shakespeare was.\n\nThe two men looked at each other. It seemed incredible that Theodore\nRacksole, the ineffable Racksole, who owned a thousand miles of railway,\nseveral towns, and sixty votes in Congress, should be defied by a\nwaiter, or even by a whole h\u00c3\u00b4tel. Yet so it was. When Europe's effete\nback is against the wall not a regiment of millionaires can turn its\nflank. Jules had the calm expression of a strong man sure of victory.\nHis face said: 'You beat me once, but not this time, my New York\nfriend!'\n\nAs for Nella, knowing her father, she foresaw interesting events, and\nwaited confidently for the steak. She did not feel hungry, and she could\nafford to wait.\n\n'Excuse me a moment, Nella,' said Theodore Racksole quietly, 'I shall be\nback in about two seconds,' and he strode out of the salle \u00c3\u00a0 manger. No\none in the room recognized the millionaire, for he was unknown to\nLondon, this being his first visit to Europe for over twenty years. Had\nanyone done so, and caught the expression on his face, that man might\nhave trembled for an explosion which should have blown the entire Grand\nBabylon into the Thames.\n\nJules retired strategically to a corner. He had fired; it was the\nantagonist's turn. A long and varied experience had taught Jules that a\nguest who embarks on the subjugation of a waiter is almost always lost;\nthe waiter has so many advantages in such a contest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Two HOW MR RACKSOLE OBTAINED HIS DINNER\n\nNEVERTHELESS, there are men with a confirmed habit of getting their own\nway, even as guests in an exclusive h\u00c3\u00b4tel: and Theodore Racksole had\nlong since fallen into that useful practice--except when his only\ndaughter Helen, motherless but high-spirited girl, chose to think that\nhis way crossed hers, in which case Theodore capitulated and fell back.\nBut when Theodore and his daughter happened to be going one and the same\nroad, which was pretty often, then Heaven alone might help any obstacle\nthat was so ill-advised as to stand in their path. Jules, great and\nobservant man though he was, had not noticed the terrible projecting\nchins of both father and daughter, otherwise it is possible he would\nhave reconsidered the question of the steak and Bass.\n\nTheodore Racksole went direct to the entrance-hall of the h\u00c3\u00b4tel, and\nentered Miss Spencer's sanctum.\n\n'I want to see Mr Babylon,' he said, 'without the delay of an instant.'\n\nMiss Spencer leisurely raised her flaxen head.\n\n'I am afraid--,' she began the usual formula. It was part of her daily\nduty to discourage guests who desired to see Mr Babylon.\n\n'No, no,' said Racksole quickly, 'I don't want any \"I'm afraids.\" This\nis business. If you had been the ordinary h\u00c3\u00b4tel clerk I should have\nslipped you a couple of sovereigns into your hand, and the thing would\nhave been done.\n\nAs you are not--as you are obviously above bribes--I merely say to you,\nI must see Mr Babylon at once on an affair of the utmost urgency. My\nname is Racksole--Theodore Racksole.'\n\n'Of New York?' questioned a voice at the door, with a slight foreign\naccent.\n\nThe millionaire turned sharply, and saw a rather short, French-looking\nman, with a bald head, a grey beard, a long and perfectly-built frock\ncoat, eye-glasses attached to a minute silver chain, and blue eyes that\nseemed to have the transparent innocence of a maid's.\n\n'There is only one,' said Theodore Racksole succinctly.\n\n'You wish to see me?' the new-comer suggested.\n\n'You are Mr Felix Babylon?'\n\nThe man bowed.\n\n'At this moment I wish to see you more than anyone else in the world,'\nsaid Racksole. 'I am consumed and burnt up with a desire to see you, Mr\nBabylon.\n\nI only want a few minutes' quiet chat. I fancy I can settle my business\nin that time.'\n\nWith a gesture Mr Babylon invited the millionaire down a side corridor,\nat the end of which was Mr Babylon's private room, a miracle of Louis XV\nfurniture and tapestry: like most unmarried men with large incomes, Mr\nBabylon had 'tastes' of a highly expensive sort.\n\nThe landlord and his guest sat down opposite each other. Theodore\nRacksole had met with the usual millionaire's luck in this adventure,\nfor Mr Babylon made a practice of not allowing himself to be interviewed\nby his guests, however distinguished, however wealthy, however\npertinacious. If he had not chanced to enter Miss Spencer's office at\nthat precise moment, and if he had not been impressed in a somewhat\npeculiar way by the physiognomy of the millionaire, not all Mr\nRacksole's American energy and ingenuity would have availed for a\nconfabulation with the owner of the Grand Babylon H\u00c3\u00b4tel that night.\nTheodore Racksole, however, was ignorant that a mere accident had served\nhim. He took all the credit to himself.\n\n'I read in the New York papers some months ago,' Theodore started,\nwithout even a clearing of the throat, 'that this h\u00c3\u00b4tel of yours, Mr\nBabylon, was to be sold to a limited company, but it appears that the\nsale was not carried out.'\n\n'It was not,' answered Mr Babylon frankly, 'and the reason was that the\nmiddle-men between the proposed company and myself wished to make a\nlarge secret profit, and I declined to be a party to such a profit. They\nwere firm; I was firm; and so the affair came to nothing.'\n\n'The agreed price was satisfactory?'\n\n'Quite.'\n\n'May I ask what the price was?'\n\n'Are you a buyer, Mr Racksole?'\n\n'Are you a seller, Mr Babylon?'\n\n'I am,' said Babylon, 'on terms. The price was four hundred thousand\npounds, including the leasehold and goodwill. But I sell only on the\ncondition that the buyer does not transfer the property to a limited\ncompany at a higher figure.'\n\n'I will put one question to you, Mr Babylon,' said the millionaire.\n'What have your profits averaged during the last four years?'\n\n'Thirty-four thousand pounds per annum.'\n\n'I buy,' said Theodore Racksole, smiling contentedly; 'and we will, if\nyou please, exchange contract-letters on the spot.'\n\n'You come quickly to a resolution, Mr Racksole. But perhaps you have\nbeen considering this question for a long time?'\n\n'On the contrary,' Racksole looked at his watch, 'I have been\nconsidering it for six minutes.'\n\nFelix Babylon bowed, as one thoroughly accustomed to eccentricity of\nwealth.\n\n'The beauty of being well-known,' Racksole continued, 'is that you\nneedn't trouble about preliminary explanations. You, Mr Babylon,\nprobably know all about me. I know a good deal about you. We can take\neach other for granted without reference. Really, it is as simple to buy\nan h\u00c3\u00b4tel or a railroad as it is to buy a watch, provided one is equal to\nthe transaction.'\n\n'Precisely,' agreed Mr Babylon smiling. 'Shall we draw up the little\ninformal contract? There are details to be thought of. But it occurs to\nme that you cannot have dined yet, and might prefer to deal with minor\nquestions after dinner.'\n\n'I have not dined,' said the millionaire, with emphasis, 'and in that\nconnexion will you do me a favour? Will you send for Mr Rocco?'\n\n'You wish to see him, naturally.'\n\n'I do,' said the millionaire, and added, 'about my dinner.'\n\n'Rocco is a great man,' murmured Mr Babylon as he touched the bell,\nignoring the last words. 'My compliments to Mr Rocco,' he said to the\npage who answered his summons, 'and if it is quite convenient I should\nbe glad to see him here for a moment.'\n\n'What do you give Rocco?' Racksole inquired.\n\n'Two thousand a year and the treatment of an Ambassador.'\n\n'I shall give him the treatment of an Ambassador and three thousand.'\n\n'You will be wise,' said Felix Babylon.\n\nAt that moment Rocco came into the room, very softly--a man of forty,\nthin, with long, thin hands, and an inordinately long brown silky\nmoustache.\n\n'Rocco,' said Felix Babylon, 'let me introduce Mr Theodore Racksole, of\nNew York.'\n\n'Sharmed,' said Rocco, bowing. 'Ze--ze, vat you call it, millionaire?'\n\n'Exactly,' Racksole put in, and continued quickly: 'Mr Rocco, I wish to\nacquaint you before any other person with the fact that I have purchased\nthe Grand Babylon H\u00c3\u00b4tel. If you think well to afford me the privilege of\nretaining your services I shall be happy to offer you a remuneration of\nthree thousand a year.'\n\n'Tree, you said?'\n\n'Three.'\n\n'Sharmed.'\n\n'And now, Mr Rocco, will you oblige me very much by ordering a plain\nbeefsteak and a bottle of Bass to be served by Jules--I particularly\ndesire Jules--at table No. 17 in the dining-room in ten minutes from\nnow? And will you do me the honour of lunching with me to-morrow?'\n\nMr Rocco gasped, bowed, muttered something in French, and departed.\n\nFive minutes later the buyer and seller of the Grand Babylon H\u00c3\u00b4tel had\neach signed a curt document, scribbled out on the h\u00c3\u00b4tel note-paper.\nFelix Babylon asked no questions, and it was this heroic absence of\ncuriosity, of surprise on his part, that more than anything else\nimpressed Theodore Racksole. How many h\u00c3\u00b4tel proprietors in the world,\nRacksole asked himself, would have let that beef-steak and Bass go by\nwithout a word of comment.\n\n'From what date do you wish the purchase to take effect?' asked Babylon.\n\n'Oh,' said Racksole lightly, 'it doesn't matter. Shall we say from to-\nnight?'\n\n'As you will. I have long wished to retire. And now that the moment has\ncome--and so dramatically--I am ready. I shall return to Switzerland.\nOne cannot spend much money there, but it is my native land. I shall be\nthe richest man in Switzerland.' He smiled with a kind of sad amusement.\n\n'I suppose you are fairly well off?' said Racksole, in that easy\nfamiliar style of his, as though the idea had just occurred to him.\n\n'Besides what I shall receive from you, I have half a million invested.'\n\n'Then you will be nearly a millionaire?'\n\nFelix Babylon nodded.\n\n'I congratulate you, my dear sir,' said Racksole, in the tone of a judge\naddressing a newly-admitted barrister. 'Nine hundred thousand pounds,\nexpressed in francs, will sound very nice--in Switzerland.'\n\n'Of course to you, Mr Racksole, such a sum would be poverty. Now if one\nmight guess at your own wealth?' Felix Babylon was imitating the other's\nfreedom.\n\n'I do not know, to five millions or so, what I am worth,' said Racksole,\nwith sincerity, his tone indicating that he would have been glad to give\nthe information if it were in his power.\n\n'You have had anxieties, Mr Racksole?'\n\n'Still have them. I am now holiday-making in London with my daughter in\norder to get rid of them for a time.'\n\n'Is the purchase of h\u00c3\u00b4tels your notion of relaxation, then?'\n\nRacksole shrugged his shoulders. 'It is a change from railroads,' he\nlaughed.\n\n'Ah, my friend, you little know what you have bought.'\n\n'Oh! yes I do,' returned Racksole; 'I have bought just the first h\u00c3\u00b4tel\nin the world.'\n\n'That is true, that is true,' Babylon admitted, gazing meditatively at\nthe antique Persian carpet. 'There is nothing, anywhere, like my h\u00c3\u00b4tel.\nBut you will regret the purchase, Mr Racksole. It is no business of\nmine, of course, but I cannot help repeating that you will regret the\npurchase.'\n\n'I never regret.'\n\n'Then you will begin very soon--perhaps to-night.'\n\n'Why do you say that?'\n\n'Because the Grand Babylon is the Grand Babylon. You think because you\ncontrol a railroad, or an iron-works, or a line of steamers, therefore\nyou can control anything. But no. Not the Grand Babylon. There is\nsomething about the Grand Babylon--' He threw up his hands.\n\n'Servants rob you, of course.'\n\n'Of course. I suppose I lose a hundred pounds a week in that way. But it\nis not that I mean. It is the guests. The guests are too--too\ndistinguished.\n\nThe great Ambassadors, the great financiers, the great nobles, all the\nmen that move the world, put up under my roof. London is the centre of\neverything, and my h\u00c3\u00b4tel--your h\u00c3\u00b4tel--is the centre of London. Once I\nhad a King and a Dowager Empress staying here at the same time. Imagine\nthat!'\n\n'A great honour, Mr Babylon. But wherein lies the difficulty?'\n\n'Mr Racksole,' was the grim reply, 'what has become of your shrewdness--\nthat shrewdness which has made your fortune so immense that even you\ncannot calculate it? Do you not perceive that the roof which habitually\nshelters all the force, all the authority of the world, must necessarily\nalso shelter nameless and numberless plotters, schemers, evil-doers, and\nworkers of mischief? The thing is as clear as day--and as dark as night.\nMr Racksole, I never know by whom I am surrounded. I never know what is\ngoing forward.\n\nOnly sometimes I get hints, glimpses of strange acts and strange\nsecrets.\n\nYou mentioned my servants. They are almost all good servants, skilled,\ncompetent. But what are they besides? For anything I know my fourth sub-\nchef may be an agent of some European Government. For anything I know my\ninvaluable Miss Spencer may be in the pay of a court dressmaker or a\nFrankfort banker. Even Rocco may be someone else in addition to Rocco.'\n\n'That makes it all the more interesting,' remarked Theodore Racksole.\n\n'What a long time you have been, Father,' said Nella, when he returned\nto table No. 17 in the salle manger.\n\n'Only twenty minutes, my dove.'\n\n'But you said two seconds. There is a difference.'\n\n'Well, you see, I had to wait for the steak to cook.'\n\n'Did you have much trouble in getting my birthday treat?'\n\n'No trouble. But it didn't come quite as cheap as you said.'\n\n'What do you mean, Father?'\n\n'Only that I've bought the entire h\u00c3\u00b4tel. But don't split.'\n\n'Father, you always were a delicious parent. Shall you give me the h\u00c3\u00b4tel\nfor a birthday present?'\n\n'No. I shall run it--as an amusement. By the way, who is that chair\nfor?'\n\nHe noticed that a third cover had been laid at the table.\n\n'That is for a friend of mine who came in about five minutes ago. Of\ncourse I told him he must share our steak. He'll be here in a moment.'\n\n'May I respectfully inquire his name?'\n\n'Dimmock--Christian name Reginald; profession, English companion to\nPrince Aribert of Posen. I met him when I was in St Petersburg with\ncousin Hetty last fall. Oh; here he is. Mr Dimmock, this is my dear\nfather. He has succeeded with the steak.'\n\nTheodore Racksole found himself confronted by a very young man, with\ndeep black eyes, and a fresh, boyish expression. They began to talk.\n\nJules approached with the steak. Racksole tried to catch the waiter's\neye, but could not. The dinner proceeded.\n\n'Oh, Father!' cried Nella, 'what a lot of mustard you have taken!'\n\n'Have I?' he said, and then he happened to glance into a mirror on his\nleft hand between two windows. He saw the reflection of Jules, who stood\nbehind his chair, and he saw Jules give a slow, significant, ominous\nwink to Mr Dimmock--Christian name, Reginald.\n\nHe examined his mustard in silence. He thought that perhaps he had\nhelped himself rather plenteously to mustard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Three AT THREE A.M.\n\nMR REGINALD DIMMOCK proved himself, despite his extreme youth, to be a\nman of the world and of experiences, and a practised talker.\nConversation between him and Nella Racksole seemed never to flag. They\nchattered about St Petersburg, and the ice on the Neva, and the tenor at\nthe opera who had been exiled to Siberia, and the quality of Russian\ntea, and the sweetness of Russian champagne, and various other aspects\nof Muscovite existence. Russia exhausted, Nella lightly outlined her own\ndoings since she had met the young man in the Tsar's capital, and this\nrecital brought the topic round to London, where it stayed till the\nfinal piece of steak was eaten. Theodore Racksole noticed that Mr\nDimmock gave very meagre information about his own movements, either\npast or future. He regarded the youth as a typical hanger-on of Courts,\nand wondered how he had obtained his post of companion to Prince Aribert\nof Posen, and who Prince Aribert of Posen might be. The millionaire\nthought he had once heard of Posen, but he wasn't sure; he rather\nfancied it was one of those small nondescript German States of which\nfive-sixths of the subjects are Palace officials, and the rest charcoal-\nburners or innkeepers. Until the meal was nearly over, Racksole said\nlittle--perhaps his thoughts were too busy with Jules' wink to Mr\nDimmock, but when ices had been followed by coffee, he decided that it\nmight be as well, in the interests of the h\u00c3\u00b4tel, to discover something\nabout his daughter's friend. He never for an instant questioned her\nright to possess her own friends; he had always left her in the most\namazing liberty, relying on her inherited good sense to keep her out of\nmischief; but, quite apart from the wink, he was struck by Nella's\nattitude towards Mr Dimmock, an attitude in which an amiable scorn was\nblended with an evident desire to propitiate and please.\n\n'Nella tells me, Mr Dimmock, that you hold a confidential position with\nPrince Aribert of Posen,' said Racksole. 'You will pardon an American's\nignorance, but is Prince Aribert a reigning Prince--what, I believe, you\ncall in Europe, a Prince Regnant?'\n\n'His Highness is not a reigning Prince, nor ever likely to be,' answered\nDimmock. 'The Grand Ducal Throne of Posen is occupied by his Highness's\nnephew, the Grand Duke Eugen.'\n\n'Nephew?' cried Nella with astonishment.\n\n'Why not, dear lady?'\n\n'But Prince Aribert is surely very young?'\n\n'The Prince, by one of those vagaries of chance which occur sometimes in\nthe history of families, is precisely the same age as the Grand Duke.\nThe late Grand Duke's father was twice married. Hence this youthfulness\non the part of an uncle.'\n\n'How delicious to be the uncle of someone as old as yourself! But I\nsuppose it is no fun for Prince Aribert. I suppose he has to be\nfrightfully respectful and obedient, and all that, to his nephew?'\n\n'The Grand Duke and my Serene master are like brothers. At present, of\ncourse, Prince Aribert is nominally heir to the throne, but as no doubt\nyou are aware, the Grand Duke will shortly marry a near relative of the\nEmperor's, and should there be a family--' Mr Dimmock stopped and\nshrugged his straight shoulders. 'The Grand Duke,' he went on, without\nfinishing the last sentence, 'would much prefer Prince Aribert to be his\nsuccessor. He really doesn't want to marry. Between ourselves, strictly\nbetween ourselves, he regards marriage as rather a bore. But, of course,\nbeing a German Grand Duke, he is bound to marry. He owes it to his\ncountry, to Posen.'\n\n'How large is Posen?' asked Racksole bluntly.\n\n'Father,' Nella interposed laughing, 'you shouldn't ask such\ninconvenient questions. You ought to have guessed that it isn't\netiquette to inquire about the size of a German Dukedom.'\n\n'I am sure,' said Dimmock, with a polite smile, 'that the Grand Duke is\nas much amused as anyone at the size of his territory. I forget the\nexact acreage, but I remember that once Prince Aribert and myself walked\nacross it and back again in a single day.'\n\n'Then the Grand Duke cannot travel very far within his own dominions?\nYou may say that the sun does set on his empire?'\n\n'It does,' said Dimmock.\n\n'Unless the weather is cloudy,' Nella put in. 'Is the Grand Duke content\nalways to stay at home?'\n\n'On the contrary, he is a great traveller, much more so than Prince\nAribert.\n\nI may tell you, what no one knows at present, outside this h\u00c3\u00b4tel, that\nhis Royal Highness the Grand Duke, with a small suite, will be here to-\nmorrow.'\n\n'In London?' asked Nella.\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'In this h\u00c3\u00b4tel?'\n\n'Yes.'\n\n'Oh! How lovely!'\n\n'That is why your humble servant is here to-night--a sort of advance\nguard.'\n\n'But I understood,' Racksole said, 'that you were--er--attached to\nPrince Aribert, the uncle.'\n\n'I am. Prince Aribert will also be here. The Grand Duke and the Prince\nhave business about important investments connected with the Grand\nDuke's marriage settlement.... In the highest quarters, you understand.'\n\n'For so discreet a person,' thought Racksole, 'you are fairly\ncommunicative.' Then he said aloud: 'Shall we go out on the terrace?'\n\nAs they crossed the dining-room Jules stopped Mr Dimmock and handed him\na letter. 'Just come, sir, by messenger,' said Jules.\n\nNella dropped behind for a second with her father. 'Leave me alone with\nthis boy a little--there's a dear parent,' she whispered in his ear.\n\n'I am a mere cypher, an obedient nobody,' Racksole replied, pinching her\narm surreptitiously. 'Treat me as such. Use me as you like. I will go\nand look after my h\u00c3\u00b4tel' And soon afterwards he disappeared.\n\nNella and Mr Dimmock sat together on the terrace, sipping iced drinks.\nThey made a handsome couple, bowered amid plants which blossomed at the\ncommand of a Chelsea wholesale florist. People who passed by remarked\nprivately that from the look of things there was the beginning of a\nromance in that conversation. Perhaps there was, but a more intimate\nacquaintance with the character of Nella Racksole would have been\nnecessary in order to predict what precise form that romance would take.\n\nJules himself served the liquids, and at ten o'clock he brought another\nnote. Entreating a thousand pardons, Reginald Dimmock, after he had\nglanced at the note, excused himself on the plea of urgent business for\nhis Serene master, uncle of the Grand Duke of Posen. He asked if he\nmight fetch Mr Racksole, or escort Miss Racksole to her father. But Miss\nRacksole said gaily that she felt no need of an escort, and should go to\nbed. She added that her father and herself always endeavoured to be\nindependent of each other.\n\nJust then Theodore Racksole had found his way once more into Mr\nBabylon's private room. Before arriving there, however, he had\ndiscovered that in some mysterious manner the news of the change of\nproprietorship had worked its way down to the lowest strata of the\nh\u00c3\u00b4tel's cosmos. The corridors hummed with it, and even under-servants\nwere to be seen discussing the thing, just as though it mattered to\nthem.\n\n'Have a cigar, Mr Racksole,' said the urbane Mr Babylon, 'and a mouthful\nof the oldest cognac in all Europe.'\n\nIn a few minutes these two were talking eagerly, rapidly. Felix Babylon\nwas astonished at Racksole's capacity for absorbing the details of h\u00c3\u00b4tel\nmanagement. And as for Racksole he soon realized that Felix Babylon must\nbe a prince of h\u00c3\u00b4tel managers. It had never occurred to Racksole before\nthat to manage an h\u00c3\u00b4tel, even a large h\u00c3\u00b4tel, could be a specially\ninteresting affair, or that it could make any excessive demands upon the\nbrains of the manager; but he came to see that he had underrated the\npossibilities of an h\u00c3\u00b4tel. The business of the Grand Babylon was\nenormous. It took Racksole, with all his genius for organization,\nexactly half an hour to master the details of the h\u00c3\u00b4tel laundry-work.\nAnd the laundry-work was but one branch of activity amid scores, and not\na very large one at that. The machinery of checking supplies, and of\nestablishing a mean ratio between the raw stuff received in the kitchen\nand the number of meals served in the salle \u00c3\u00a0 manger and the private\nrooms, was very complicated and delicate. When Racksole had grasped it,\nhe at once suggested some improvements, and this led to a long\ntheoretical discussion, and the discussion led to digressions, and then\nFelix Babylon, in a moment of absent-mindedness, yawned.\n\nRacksole looked at the gilt clock on the high mantelpiece.\n\n'Great Scott!' he said. 'It's three o'clock. Mr Babylon, accept my\napologies for having kept you up to such an absurd hour.'\n\n'I have not spent so pleasant an evening for many years. You have let me\nride my hobby to my heart's content. It is I who should apologize.'\n\nRacksole rose.\n\n'I should like to ask you one question,' said Babylon. 'Have you ever\nhad anything to do with h\u00c3\u00b4tels before?'\n\n'Never,' said Racksole.\n\n'Then you have missed your vocation. You could have been the greatest of\nall h\u00c3\u00b4tel-managers. You would have been greater than me, and I am\nunequalled, though I keep only one h\u00c3\u00b4tel, and some men have half a\ndozen. Mr Racksole, why have you never run an h\u00c3\u00b4tel?'\n\n'Heaven knows,' he laughed, 'but you flatter me, Mr Babylon.'\n\n'I? Flatter? You do not know me. I flatter no one, except, perhaps, now\nand then an exceptionally distinguished guest. In which case I give\nsuitable instructions as to the bill.'\n\n'Speaking of distinguished guests, I am told that a couple of German\nprinces are coming here to-morrow.'\n\n'That is so.'\n\n'Does one do anything? Does one receive them formally--stand bowing in\nthe entrance-hall, or anything of that sort?'\n\n'Not necessarily. Not unless one wishes. The modern h\u00c3\u00b4tel proprietor is\nnot like an innkeeper of the Middle Ages, and even princes do not expect\nto see him unless something should happen to go wrong. As a matter of\nfact, though the Grand Duke of Posen and Prince Aribert have both\nhonoured me by staying here before, I have never even set eyes on them.\nYou will find all arrangements have been made.'\n\nThey talked a little longer, and then Racksole said good night. 'Let me\nsee you to your room. The lifts will be closed and the place will be\ndeserted.\n\nAs for myself, I sleep here,' and Mr Babylon pointed to an inner door.\n\n'No, thanks,' said Racksole; 'let me explore my own h\u00c3\u00b4tel unaccompanied.\nI believe I can discover my room.' When he got fairly into the passages,\nRacksole was not so sure that he could discover his own room. The number\nwas 107, but he had forgotten whether it was on the first or second\nfloor.\n\nTravelling in a lift, one is unconscious of floors. He passed several\nlift-doorways, but he could see no glint of a staircase; in all self-\nrespecting h\u00c3\u00b4tels staircases have gone out of fashion, and though h\u00c3\u00b4tel\narchitects still continue, for old sakes' sake, to build staircases,\nthey are tucked away in remote corners where their presence is not\nlikely to offend the eye of a spoiled and cosmopolitan public. The h\u00c3\u00b4tel\nseemed vast, uncanny, deserted. An electric light glowed here and there\nat long intervals. On the thick carpets, Racksole's thinly-shod feet\nmade no sound, and he wandered at ease to and fro, rather amused, rather\nstruck by the peculiar senses of night and mystery which had suddenly\ncome over him. He fancied he could hear a thousand snores peacefully\ndescending from the upper realms. At length he found a staircase, a very\ndark and narrow one, and presently he was on the first floor. He soon\ndiscovered that the numbers of the rooms on this floor did not get\nbeyond seventy. He encountered another staircase and ascended to the\nsecond floor. By the decoration of the walls he recognized this floor as\nhis proper home, and as he strolled through the long corridor he\nwhistled a low, meditative whistle of satisfaction. He thought he heard\na step in the transverse corridor, and instinctively he obliterated\nhimself in a recess which held a service-cabinet and a chair. He did\nhear a step. Peeping cautiously out, he perceived, what he had not\nperceived previously, that a piece of white ribbon had been tied round\nthe handle of the door of one of the bedrooms. Then a man came round the\ncorner of the transverse corridor, and Racksole drew back. It was Jules-\n-Jules with his hands in his pockets and a slouch hat over his eyes, but\nin other respects attired as usual.\n\nRacksole, at that instant, remembered with a special vividness what\nFelix Babylon had said to him at their first interview. He wished he had\nbrought his revolver. He didn't know why he should feel the desirability\nof a revolver in a London h\u00c3\u00b4tel of the most unimpeachable fair fame, but\nhe did feel the desirability of such an instrument of attack and\ndefence. He privately decided that if Jules went past his recess he\nwould take him by the throat and in that attitude put a few plain\nquestions to this highly dubious waiter. But Jules had stopped. The\nmillionaire made another cautious observation. Jules, with infinite\ngentleness, was turning the handle of the door to which the white ribbon\nwas attached. The door slowly yielded and Jules disappeared within the\nroom. After a brief interval, the night-prowling Jules reappeared,\nclosed the door as softly as he had opened it, removed the ribbon,\nreturned upon his steps, and vanished down the transverse corridor.\n\n'This is quaint,' said Racksole; 'quaint to a degree!'\n\nIt occurred to him to look at the number of the room, and he stole\ntowards it.\n\n'Well, I'm d--d!' he murmured wonderingly.\n\nThe number was 111, his daughter's room! He tried to open it, but the\ndoor was locked. Rushing to his own room, No. 107, he seized one of a\npair of revolvers (the kind that are made for millionaires) and followed\nafter Jules down the transverse corridor. At the end of this corridor\nwas a window; the window was open; and Jules was innocently gazing out\nof the window. Ten silent strides, and Theodore Racksole was upon him.\n\n'One word, my friend,' the millionaire began, carelessly waving the\nrevolver in the air. Jules was indubitably startled, but by an admirable\nexercise of self-control he recovered possession of his faculties in a\nsecond.\n\n'Sir?' said Jules.\n\n'I just want to be informed, what the deuce you were doing in No. 111 a\nmoment ago.'\n\n'I had been requested to go there,' was the calm response.\n\n'You are a liar, and not a very clever one. That is my daughter's room.\nNow--out with it, before I decide whether to shoot you or throw you into\nthe street.'\n\n'Excuse me, sir, No. 111 is occupied by a gentleman.'\n\n'I advise you that it is a serious error of judgement to contradict me,\nmy friend. Don't do it again. We will go to the room together, and you\nshall prove that the occupant is a gentleman, and not my daughter.'\n\n'Impossible, sir,' said Jules.\n\n'Scarcely that,' said Racksole, and he took Jules by the sleeve. The\nmillionaire knew for a certainty that Nella occupied No. 111, for he had\nexamined the room her, and himself seen that her trunks and her maid and\nherself had arrived there in safety. 'Now open the door,' whispered\nRacksole, when they reached No.111.\n\n'I must knock.'\n\n'That is just what you mustn't do. Open it. No doubt you have your pass-\nkey.'\n\nConfronted by the revolver, Jules readily obeyed, yet with a deprecatory\ngesture, as though he would not be responsible for this outrage against\nthe decorum of h\u00c3\u00b4tel life. Racksole entered. The room was brilliantly\nlighted.\n\n'A visitor, who insists on seeing you, sir,' said Jules, and fled.\n\nMr Reginald Dimmock, still in evening dress, and smoking a cigarette,\nrose hurriedly from a table.\n\n'Hello, my dear Mr Racksole, this is an unexpected--ah--pleasure.'\n\n'Where is my daughter? This is her room.'\n\n'Did I catch what you said, Mr Racksole?'\n\n'I venture to remark that this is Miss Racksole's room.'\n\n'My good sir,' answered Dimmock, 'you must be mad to dream of such a\nthing.\n\nOnly my respect for your daughter prevents me from expelling you\nforcibly, for such an extraordinary suggestion.'\n\nA small spot half-way down the bridge of the millionaire's nose turned\nsuddenly white.\n\n'With your permission,' he said in a low calm voice, 'I will examine the\ndressing-room and the bath-room.'\n\n'Just listen to me a moment,' Dimmock urged, in a milder tone.\n\n'I'll listen to you afterwards, my young friend,' said Racksole, and he\nproceeded to search the bath-room, and the dressing-room, without any\nresult whatever. 'Lest my attitude might be open to misconstruction, Mr\nDimmock, I may as well tell you that I have the most perfect confidence\nin my daughter, who is as well able to take care of herself as any woman\nI ever met, but since you entered it there have been one or two rather\nmysterious occurrences in this h\u00c3\u00b4tel. That is all.' Feeling a draught of\nair on his shoulder, Racksole turned to the window. 'For instance,' he\nadded, 'I perceive that this window is broken, badly broken, and from\nthe outside.\n\nNow, how could that have occurred?'\n\n'If you will kindly hear reason, Mr Racksole,' said Dimmock in his best\ndiplomatic manner, 'I will endeavour to explain things to you. I\nregarded your first question to me when you entered my room as being\noffensively put, but I now see that you had some justification.' He\nsmiled politely. 'I was passing along this corridor about eleven\no'clock, when I found Miss Racksole in a difficulty with the h\u00c3\u00b4tel\nservants. Miss Racksole was retiring to rest in this room when a large\nstone, which must have been thrown from the Embankment, broke the\nwindow, as you see. Apart from the discomfort of the broken window, she\ndid not care to remain in the room. She argued that where one stone had\ncome another might follow. She therefore insisted on her room being\nchanged. The servants said that there was no other room available with a\ndressing-room and bath-room attached, and your daughter made a point of\nthese matters. I at once offered to exchange apartments with her. She\ndid me the honour to accept my offer. Our respective belongings were\nmoved--and that is all. Miss Racksole is at this moment, I trust, asleep\nin No. 124.'\n\nTheodore Racksole looked at the young man for a few seconds in silence.\n\nThere was a faint knock at the door.\n\n'Come in,' said Racksole loudly.\n\nSomeone pushed open the door, but remained standing on the mat. It was\nNella's maid, in a dressing-gown.\n\n'Miss Racksole's compliments, and a thousand excuses, but a book of hers\nwas left on the mantelshelf in this room. She cannot sleep, and wishes\nto read.'\n\n'Mr Dimmock, I tender my apologies--my formal apologies,' said Racksole,\nwhen the girl had gone away with the book. 'Good night.'\n\n'Pray don't mention it,' said Dimmock suavely--and bowed him out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Four ENTRANCE OF THE PRINCE\n\nNEVERTHELESS, sundry small things weighed on Racksole's mind. First\nthere was Jules' wink. Then there was the ribbon on the door-handle and\nJules' visit to No. 111, and the broken window--broken from the outside.\nRacksole did not forget that the time was 3 a.m. He slept but little\nthat night, but he was glad that he had bought the Grand Babylon H\u00c3\u00b4tel.\nIt was an acquisition which seemed to promise fun and diversion.\n\nThe next morning he came across Mr Babylon early. 'I have emptied my\nprivate room of all personal papers,' said Babylon, 'and it is now at\nyour disposal.\n\nI purpose, if agreeable to yourself, to stay on in the h\u00c3\u00b4tel as a guest\nfor the present. We have much to settle with regard to the completion of\nthe purchase, and also there are things which you might want to ask me.\nAlso, to tell the truth, I am not anxious to leave the old place with\ntoo much suddenness. It will be a wrench to me.'\n\n'I shall be delighted if you will stay,' said the millionaire, 'but it\nmust be as my guest, not as the guest of the h\u00c3\u00b4tel.'\n\n'You are very kind.'\n\n'As for wishing to consult you, no doubt I shall have need to do so, but\nI must say that the show seems to run itself.'\n\n'Ah!' said Babylon thoughtfully. 'I have heard of h\u00c3\u00b4tels that run\nthemselves. If they do, you may be sure that they obey the laws of\ngravity and run downwards. You will have your hands full. For example,\nhave you yet heard about Miss Spencer?'\n\n'No,' said Racksole. 'What of her?'\n\n'She has mysteriously vanished during the night, and nobody appears to\nbe able to throw any light on the affair. Her room is empty, her boxes\ngone.\n\nYou will want someone to take her place, and that someone will not be\nvery easy to get.'\n\n'H'm!' Racksole said, after a pause. 'Hers is not the only post that\nfalls vacant to-day.'\n\nA little later, the millionaire installed himself in the late owner's\nprivate room and rang the bell.\n\n'I want Jules,' he said to the page.\n\nWhile waiting for Jules, Racksole considered the question of Miss\nSpencer's disappearance.\n\n'Good morning, Jules,' was his cheerful greeting, when the imperturbable\nwaiter arrived.\n\n'Good morning, sir.'\n\n'Take a chair.'\n\n'Thank you, sir.'\n\n'We have met before this morning, Jules.'\n\n'Yes, sir, at 3 a.m.'\n\n'Rather strange about Miss Spencer's departure, is it not?' suggested\nRacksole.\n\n'It is remarkable, sir.'\n\n'You are aware, of course, that Mr Babylon has transferred all his\ninterests in this h\u00c3\u00b4tel to me?'\n\n'I have been informed to that effect, sir.'\n\n'I suppose you know everything that goes on in the h\u00c3\u00b4tel, Jules?'\n\n'As the head waiter, sir, it is my business to keep a general eye on\nthings.'\n\n'You speak very good English for a foreigner, Jules.'\n\n'For a foreigner, sir! I am an Englishman, a Hertfordshire man born and\nbred. Perhaps my name has misled you, sir. I am only called Jules\nbecause the head waiter of any really high-class h\u00c3\u00b4tel must have either\na French or an Italian name.'\n\n'I see,' said Racksole. 'I think you must be rather a clever person,\nJules.'\n\n'That is not for me to say, sir.'\n\n'How long has the h\u00c3\u00b4tel enjoyed the advantage of your services?'\n\n'A little over twenty years.'\n\n'That is a long time to be in one place. Don't you think it's time you\ngot out of the rut? You are still young, and might make a reputation for\nyourself in another and wider sphere.'\n\nRacksole looked at the man steadily, and his glance was steadily\nreturned.\n\n'You aren't satisfied with me, sir?'\n\n'To be frank, Jules, I think--I think you--er--wink too much. And I\nthink that it is regrettable when a head waiter falls into a habit of\ntaking white ribbons from the handles of bedroom doors at three in the\nmorning.'\n\nJules started slightly.\n\n'I see how it is, sir. You wish me to go, and one pretext, if I may use\nthe term, is as good as another. Very well, I can't say that I'm\nsurprised. It sometimes happens that there is incompatibility of temper\nbetween a h\u00c3\u00b4tel proprietor and his head waiter, and then, unless one of\nthem goes, the h\u00c3\u00b4tel is likely to suffer. I will go, Mr Racksole. In\nfact, I had already thought of giving notice.'\n\nThe millionaire smiled appreciatively. 'What wages do you require in\nlieu of notice? It is my intention that you leave the h\u00c3\u00b4tel within an\nhour.'\n\n'I require no wages in lieu of notice, sir. I would scorn to accept\nanything. And I will leave the h\u00c3\u00b4tel in fifteen minutes.'\n\n'Good-day, then. You have my good wishes and my admiration, so long as\nyou keep out of my h\u00c3\u00b4tel.'\n\nRacksole got up. 'Good-day, sir. And thank you.'\n\n'By the way, Jules, it will be useless for you to apply to any other\nfirst-rate European h\u00c3\u00b4tel for a post, because I shall take measures\nwhich will ensure the rejection of any such application.'\n\n'Without discussing the question whether or not there aren't at least\nhalf a dozen h\u00c3\u00b4tels in London alone that would jump for joy at the\nchance of getting me,' answered Jules, 'I may tell you, sir, that I\nshall retire from my profession.'\n\n'Really! You will turn your brains to a different channel.'\n\n'No, sir. I shall take rooms in Albemarle Street or Jermyn Street, and\njust be content to be a man-about-town. I have saved some twenty\nthousand pounds--a mere trifle, but sufficient for my needs, and I shall\nnow proceed to enjoy it. Pardon me for troubling you with my personal\naffairs. And good-day again.'\n\nThat afternoon Racksole went with Felix Babylon first to a firm of\nsolicitors in the City, and then to a stockbroker, in order to carry out\nthe practical details of the purchase of the h\u00c3\u00b4tel.\n\n'I mean to settle in England,' said Racksole, as they were coming back.\n'It is the only country--' and he stopped.\n\n'The only country?'\n\n'The only country where you can invest money and spend money with a\nfeeling of security. In the United States there is nothing worth\nspending money on, nothing to buy. In France or Italy, there is no real\nsecurity.'\n\n'But surely you are a true American?' questioned Babylon.\n\n'I am a true American,' said Racksole, 'but my father, who began by\nbeing a bedmaker at an Oxford college, and ultimately made ten million\ndollars out of iron in Pittsburg--my father took the wise precaution of\nhaving me educated in England. I had my three years at Oxford, like any\nson of the upper middle class! It did me good. It has been worth more to\nme than many successful speculations. It taught me that the English\nlanguage is different from, and better than, the American language, and\nthat there is something--I haven't yet found out exactly what--in\nEnglish life that Americans will never get. Why,' he added, 'in the\nUnited States we still bribe our judges and our newspapers. And we talk\nof the eighteenth century as though it was the beginning of the world.\nYes, I shall transfer my securities to London. I shall build a house in\nPark Lane, and I shall buy some immemorial country seat with a history\nas long as the A. T. and S. railroad, and I shall calmly and gradually\nsettle down. D'you know--I am rather a good-natured man for a\nmillionaire, and of a social disposition, and yet I haven't six real\nfriends in the whole of New York City. Think of that!'\n\n'And I,' said Babylon, 'have no friends except the friends of my boyhood\nin Lausanne. I have spent thirty years in England, and gained nothing\nbut a perfect knowledge of the English language and as much gold coin as\nwould fill a rather large box.'\n\nThese two plutocrats breathed a simultaneous sigh.\n\n'Talking of gold coin,' said Racksole, 'how much money should you think\nJules has contrived to amass while he has been with you?'\n\n'Oh!' Babylon smiled. 'I should not like to guess. He has had unique\nopportunities--opportunities.'\n\n'Should you consider twenty thousand an extraordinary sum under the\ncircumstances?'\n\n'Not at all. Has he been confiding in you?'\n\n'Somewhat. I have dismissed him.'\n\n'You have dismissed him?'\n\n'Why not?'\n\n'There is no reason why not. But I have felt inclined to dismiss him for\nthe past ten years, and never found courage to do it.'\n\n'It was a perfectly simple proceeding, I assure you. Before I had done\nwith him, I rather liked the fellow.'\n\n'Miss Spencer and Jules--both gone in one day!' mused Felix Babylon.\n\n'And no one to take their places,' said Racksole. 'And yet the h\u00c3\u00b4tel\ncontinues its way!'\n\nBut when Racksole reached the Grand Babylon he found that Miss Spencer's\nchair in the bureau was occupied by a stately and imperious girl,\ndressed becomingly in black.\n\n'Heavens, Nella!' he cried, going to the bureau. 'What are you doing\nhere?'\n\n'I am taking Mis Spencer's place. I want to help you with your h\u00c3\u00b4tel,\nDad. I fancy I shall make an excellent h\u00c3\u00b4tel clerk. I have arranged with\na Miss Selina Smith, one of the typists in the office, to put me up to\nall the tips and tricks, and I shall do very well.'\n\n'But look here, Helen Racksole. We shall have the whole of London\ntalking about this thing--the greatest of all American heiresses a h\u00c3\u00b4tel\nclerk! And I came here for quiet and rest!'\n\n'I suppose it was for the sake of quiet and rest that you bought the\nh\u00c3\u00b4tel, Papa?'\n\n'You would insist on the steak,' he retorted. 'Get out of this, on the\ninstant.'\n\n'Here I am, here to stay,' said Nella, and deliberately laughed at her\nparent.\n\nJust then the face of a fair-haired man of about thirty years appeared\nat the bureau window. He was very well-dressed, very aristocratic in his\npose, and he seemed rather angry.\n\nHe looked fixedly at Nella and started back.\n\n'Ach!' he exclaimed. 'You!'\n\n'Yes, your Highness, it is indeed I. Father, this is his Serene Highness\nPrince Aribert of Posen--one of our most esteemed customers.'\n\n'You know my name, Fr\u00c3\u00a4ulein?' the new-comer murmured in German.\n\n'Certainly, Prince,' Nella replied sweetly. 'You were plain Count\nSteenbock last spring in Paris--doubtless travelling incognito--'\n\n'Silence,' he entreated, with a wave of the hand, and his forehead went\nas white as paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Five WHAT OCCURRED TO REGINALD DIMMOCK\n\nIN another moment they were all three talking quite nicely, and with at\nany rate an appearance of being natural. Prince Aribert became suave,\neven deferential to Nella, and more friendly towards Nella's father than\ntheir respective positions demanded. The latter amused himself by\nstudying this sprig of royalty, the first with whom he had ever come\ninto contact. He decided that the young fellow was personable enough,\n'had no frills on him,' and would make an exceptionally good commercial\ntraveller for a first-class firm. Such was Theodore Racksole's\npreliminary estimate of the man who might one day be the reigning Grand\nDuke of Posen.\n\nIt occurred to Nella, and she smiled at the idea, that the bureau of the\nh\u00c3\u00b4tel was scarcely the correct place in which to receive this august\nyoung man. There he stood, with his head half-way through the bureau\nwindow, negligently leaning against the woodwork, just as though he were\na stockbroker or the manager of a New York burlesque company.\n\n'Is your Highness travelling quite alone?' she asked.\n\n'By a series of accidents I am,' he said. 'My equerry was to have met me\nat Charing Cross, but he failed to do so--I cannot imagine why.'\n\n'Mr Dimmock?' questioned Racksole.\n\n'Yes, Dimmock. I do not remember that he ever missed an appointment\nbefore.\n\nYou know him? He has been here?'\n\n'He dined with us last night,' said Racksole--'on Nella's invitation,'\nhe added maliciously; 'but to-day we have seen nothing of him. I know,\nhowever, that he has engaged the State apartments, and also a suite\nadjoining the State apartments--No. 55. That is so, isn't it, Nella?'\n\n'Yes, Papa,' she said, having first demurely examined a ledger. 'Your\nHighness would doubtless like to be conducted to your room--apartments I\nmean.' Then Nella laughed deliberately at the Prince, and said, 'I don't\nknow who is the proper person to conduct you, and that's a fact. The\ntruth is that Papa and I are rather raw yet in the h\u00c3\u00b4tel line. You see,\nwe only bought the place last night.'\n\n'You have bought the h\u00c3\u00b4tel!' exclaimed the Prince.\n\n'That's so,' said Racksole.\n\n'And Felix Babylon has gone?'\n\n'He is going, if he has not already gone.'\n\n'Ah! I see,' said the Prince; 'this is one of your American \"strokes\".\nYou have bought to sell again, is that not it? You are on your holidays,\nbut you cannot resist making a few thousands by way of relaxation. I\nhave heard of such things.'\n\n'We sha'n't sell again, Prince, until we are tired of our bargain.\nSometimes we tire very quickly, and sometimes we don't. It depends--eh?\nWhat?'\n\nRacksole broke off suddenly to attend to a servant in livery who had\nquietly entered the bureau and was making urgent mysterious signs to\nhim.\n\n'If you please, sir,' the man by frantic gestures implored Mr Theodore\nRacksole to come out.\n\n'Pray don't let me detain you, Mr Racksole,' said the Prince, and\ntherefore the proprietor of the Grand Babylon departed after the\nservant, with a queer, curt little bow to Prince Aribert.\n\n'Mayn't I come inside?' said the Prince to Nella immediately the\nmillionaire had gone.\n\n'Impossible, Prince,' Nella laughed. 'The rule against visitors entering\nthis bureau is frightfully strict.'\n\n'How do you know the rule is so strict if you only came into possession\nlast night?'\n\n'I know because I made the rule myself this morning, your Highness.'\n\n'But seriously, Miss Racksole, I want to talk to you.'\n\n'Do you want to talk to me as Prince Aribert or as the friend--the\nacquaintance--whom I knew in Paris last year?'\n\n'As the friend, dear lady, if I may use the term.'\n\n'And you are sure that you would not like first to be conducted to your\napartments?'\n\n'Not yet. I will wait till Dimmock comes; he cannot fail to be here\nsoon.'\n\n'Then we will have tea served in father's private room--the proprietor's\nprivate room, you know.'\n\n'Good!' he said.\n\nNella talked through a telephone, and rang several bells, and behaved\ngenerally in a manner calculated to prove to Princes and to whomever it\nmight concern that she was a young woman of business instincts and\ntraining, and then she stepped down from her chair of office, emerged\nfrom the bureau, and, preceded by two menials, led Prince Aribert to the\nLouis XV chamber in which her father and Felix Babylon had had their\nlong confabulation on the previous evening.\n\n'What do you want to talk to me about?' she asked her companion, as she\npoured out for him a second cup of tea. The Prince looked at her for a\nmoment as he took the proffered cup, and being a young man of sane,\nhealthy, instincts, he could think of nothing for the moment except her\nloveliness.\n\nNella was indeed beautiful that afternoon. The beauty of even the most\nbeautiful woman ebbs and flows from hour to hour. Nella's this afternoon\nwas at the flood. Vivacious, alert, imperious, and yet ineffably sweet,\nshe seemed to radiate the very joy and exuberance of life.\n\n'I have forgotten,' he said.\n\n'You have forgotten! That is surely very wrong of you? You gave me to\nunderstand that it was something terribly important. But of course I\nknew it couldn't be, because no man, and especially no Prince, ever\ndiscussed anything really important with a woman.'\n\n'Recollect, Miss Racksole, that this afternoon, here, I am not the\nPrince.'\n\n'You are Count Steenbock, is that it?'\n\nHe started. 'For you only,' he said, unconsciously lowering his voice.\n'Miss Racksole, I particularly wish that no one here should know that I\nwas in Paris last spring.'\n\n'An affair of State?' she smiled.\n\n'An affair of State,' he replied soberly. 'Even Dimmock doesn't know. It\nwas strange that we should be fellow guests at that quiet out-of-the-way\nh\u00c3\u00b4tel--strange but delightful. I shall never forget that rainy afternoon\nthat we spent together in the Museum of the Trocad\u00c3\u00a9ro. Let us talk about\nthat.'\n\n'About the rain, or the museum?'\n\n'I shall never forget that afternoon,' he repeated, ignoring the\nlightness of her question.\n\n'Nor I,' she murmured corresponding to his mood.\n\n'You, too enjoyed it?' he said eagerly.\n\n'The sculptures were magnificent,' she replied, hastily glancing at the\nceiling.\n\n'Ah! So they were! Tell me, Miss Racksole, how did you discover my\nidentity.'\n\n'I must not say,' she answered. 'That is my secret. Do not seek to\npenetrate it. Who knows what horrors you might discover if you probed\ntoo far?' She laughed, but she laughed alone. The Prince remained\npensive--as it were brooding.\n\n'I never hoped to see you again,' he said.\n\n'Why not?'\n\n'One never sees again those whom one wishes to see.'\n\n'As for me, I was perfectly convinced that we should meet again.'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'Because I always get what I want.'\n\n'Then you wanted to see me again?'\n\n'Certainly. You interested me extremely. I have never met another man\nwho could talk so well about sculpture as the Count Steenbock.'\n\n'Do you really always get what you want, Miss Racksole?'\n\n'Of course.'\n\n'That is because your father is so rich, I suppose?'\n\n'Oh, no, it isn't!' she said. 'It's simply because I always do get what\nI want. It's got nothing to do with Father at all.'\n\n'But Mr Racksole is extremely wealthy?'\n\n'Wealthy isn't the word, Count. There is no word. It's positively awful\nthe amount of dollars poor Papa makes. And the worst of it is he can't\nhelp it.\n\nHe told me once that when a man had made ten millions no power on earth\ncould stop those ten millions from growing into twenty. And so it\ncontinues.\n\nI spend what I can, but I can't come near coping with it; and of course\nPapa is no use whatever at spending.'\n\n'And you have no mother?'\n\n'Who told you I had no mother?' she asked quietly.\n\n'I--er--inquired about you,' he said, with equal candour and humility.\n\n'In spite of the fact that you never hoped to see me again?'\n\n'Yes, in spite of that.'\n\n'How funny!' she said, and lapsed into a meditative silence.\n\n'Yours must be a wonderful existence,' said the Prince. 'I envy you.'\n\n'You envy me--what? My father's wealth?'\n\n'No,' he said; 'your freedom and your responsibilities.'\n\n'I have no responsibilities,' she remarked.\n\n'Pardon me,' he said; 'you have, and the time is coming when you will\nfeel them.'\n\n'I'm only a girl,' she murmured with sudden simplicity. 'As for you,\nCount, surely you have sufficient responsibilities of your own?'\n\n'I?' he said sadly. 'I have no responsibilities. I am a nobody--a Serene\nHighness who has to pretend to be very important, always taking immense\ncare never to do anything that a Serene Highness ought not to do. Bah!'\n\n'But if your nephew, Prince Eugen, were to die, would you not come to\nthe throne, and would you not then have these responsibilities which you\nso much desire?'\n\n'Eugen die?' said Prince Aribert, in a curious tone. 'Impossible. He is\nthe perfection of health. In three months he will be married. No, I\nshall never be anything but a Serene Highness, the most despicable of\nGod's creatures.'\n\n'But what about the State secret which you mentioned? Is not that a\nresponsibility?'\n\n'Ah!' he said. 'That is over. That belongs to the past. It was an\naccident in my dull career. I shall never be Count Steenbock again.'\n\n'Who knows?' she said. 'By the way, is not Prince Eugen coming here to-\nday? Mr Dimmock told us so.'\n\n'See!' answered the Prince, standing up and bending over her. 'I am\ngoing to confide in you. I don't know why, but I am.'\n\n'Don't betray State secrets,' she warned him, smiling into his face.\n\nBut just then the door of the room was unceremoniously opened.\n\n'Go right in,' said a voice sharply. It was Theodore Racksole's. Two men\nentered, bearing a prone form on a stretcher, and Racksole followed\nthem.\n\nNella sprang up. Racksole stared to see his daughter.\n\n'I didn't know you were in here, Nell. Here,' to the two men, 'out\nagain.'\n\n'Why!' exclaimed Nella, gazing fearfully at the form on the stretcher,\n'it's Mr Dimmock!'\n\n'It is,' her father acquiesced. 'He's dead,' he added laconically. 'I'd\nhave broken it to you more gently had I known. Your pardon, Prince.'\nThere was a pause.\n\n'Dimmock dead!' Prince Aribert whispered under his breath, and he\nkneeled down by the side of the stretcher. 'What does this mean?'\n\nThe poor fellow was just walking across the quadrangle towards the\nportico when he fell down. A commissionaire who saw him says he was\nwalking very quickly. At first I thought it was sunstroke, but it\ncouldn't have been, though the weather certainly is rather warm. It must\nbe heart disease. But anyhow, he's dead. We did what we could. I've sent\nfor a doctor, and for the police. I suppose there'll have to be an\ninquest.'\n\nTheodore Racksole stopped, and in an awkward solemn silence they all\ngazed at the dead youth. His features were slightly drawn, and his eyes\nclosed; that was all. He might have been asleep.\n\n'My poor Dimmock!' exclaimed the Prince, his voice broken. 'And I was\nangry because the lad did not meet me at Charing Cross!'\n\n'Are you sure he is dead, Father?' Nella said.\n\n'You'd better go away, Nella,' was Racksole's only reply; but the girl\nstood still, and began to sob quietly. On the previous night she had\nsecretly made fun of Reginald Dimmock. She had deliberately set herself\nto get information from him on a topic in which she happened to be\nspecially interested and she had got it, laughing the while at his\nyouthful crudities--his vanity, his transparent cunning, his absurd\nairs. She had not liked him; she had even distrusted him, and decided\nthat he was not 'nice'. But now, as he lay on the stretcher, these\nthings were forgotten. She went so far as to reproach herself for them.\nSuch is the strange commanding power of death.\n\n'Oblige me by taking the poor fellow to my apartments,' said the Prince,\nwith a gesture to the attendants. 'Surely it is time the doctor came.'\n\nRacksole felt suddenly at that moment he was nothing but a mere h\u00c3\u00b4tel\nproprietor with an awkward affair on his hands. For a fraction of a\nsecond he wished he had never bought the Grand Babylon.\n\nA quarter of an hour later Prince Aribert, Theodore Racksole, a doctor,\nand an inspector of police were in the Prince's reception-room. They had\njust come from an ante-chamber, in which lay the mortal remains of\nReginald Dimmock.\n\n'Well?' said Racksole, glancing at the doctor.\n\nThe doctor was a big, boyish-looking man, with keen, quizzical eyes.\n\n'It is not heart disease,' said the doctor.\n\n'Not heart disease?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'Then what is it?' asked the Prince.\n\n'I may be able to answer that question after the post-mortem,' said the\ndoctor. 'I certainly can't answer it now. The symptoms are unusual to a\ndegree.'\n\nThe inspector of police began to write in a note-book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Six IN THE GOLD ROOM\n\nAT the Grand Babylon a great ball was given that night in the Gold Room,\na huge saloon attached to the h\u00c3\u00b4tel, though scarcely part of it, and\ncertainly less exclusive than the h\u00c3\u00b4tel itself. Theodore Racksole knew\nnothing of the affair, except that it was an entertainment offered by a\nMr and Mrs Sampson Levi to their friends. Who Mr and Mrs Sampson Levi\nwere he did not know, nor could anyone tell him anything about them\nexcept that Mr Sampson Levi was a prominent member of that part of the\nStock Exchange familiarly called the Kaffir Circus, and that his wife\nwas a stout lady with an aquiline nose and many diamonds, and that they\nwere very rich and very hospitable. Theodore Racksole did not want a\nball in his h\u00c3\u00b4tel that evening, and just before dinner he had almost a\nmind to issue a decree that the Gold Room was to be closed and the ball\nforbidden, and Mr and Mrs Sampson Levi might name the amount of damages\nsuffered by them. His reasons for such a course were threefold--first,\nhe felt depressed and uneasy; second, he didn't like the name of Sampson\nLevi; and, third, he had a desire to show these so-called plutocrats\nthat their wealth was nothing to him, that they could not do what they\nchose with Theodore Racksole, and that for two pins Theodore Racksole\nwould buy them up, and the whole Kaffir Circus to boot. But something\nwarned him that though such a high-handed proceeding might be tolerated\nin America, that land of freedom, it would never be tolerated in\nEngland. He felt instinctively that in England there are things you\ncan't do, and that this particular thing was one of them. So the ball\nwent forward, and neither Mr nor Mrs Sampson Levi had ever the least\nsuspicion what a narrow escape they had had of looking very foolish in\nthe eyes of the thousand or so guests invited by them to the Gold Room\nof the Grand Babylon that evening.\n\nThe Gold Room of the Grand Babylon was built for a ballroom. A balcony,\nsupported by arches faced with gilt and lapis-lazulo, ran around it, and\nfrom this vantage men and maidens and chaperons who could not or would\nnot dance might survey the scene. Everyone knew this, and most people\ntook advantage of it. What everyone did not know--what no one knew--was\nthat higher up than the balcony there was a little barred window in the\nend wall from which the h\u00c3\u00b4tel authorities might keep a watchful eye, not\nonly on the dancers, but on the occupants of the balcony itself.\n\nIt may seem incredible to the uninitiated that the guests at any social\ngathering held in so gorgeous and renowned an apartment as the Gold Room\nof the Grand Babylon should need the observation of a watchful eye. Yet\nso it was. Strange matters and unexpected faces had been descried from\nthe little window, and more than one European detective had kept vigil\nthere with the most eminently satisfactory results.\n\nAt eleven o'clock Theodore Racksole, afflicted by vexation of spirit,\nfound himself gazing idly through the little barred window. Nella was\nwith him.\n\nTogether they had been wandering about the corridors of the h\u00c3\u00b4tel, still\nstrange to them both, and it was quite by accident that they had lighted\nupon the small room which had a surreptitious view of Mr and Mrs Sampson\nLevi's ball. Except for the light of the chandelier of the ball-room the\nlittle cubicle was in darkness. Nella was looking through the window;\nher father stood behind.\n\n'I wonder which is Mrs Sampson Levi?' Nella said, 'and whether she\nmatches her name. Wouldn't you love to have a name like that, Father--\nsomething that people could take hold of--instead of Racksole?'\n\nThe sound of violins and a confused murmur of voices rose gently up to\nthem.\n\n'Umphl' said Theodore. 'Curse those evening papers!' he added,\ninconsequently but with sincerity.\n\n'Father, you're very horrid to-night. What have the evening papers been\ndoing?'\n\n'Well, my young madame, they've got me in for one, and you for another;\nand they're manufacturing mysteries like fun. It's young Dimmock's death\nthat has started 'em.'\n\n'Well, Father, you surely didn't expect to keep yourself out of the\npapers. Besides, as regards newspapers, you ought to be glad you aren't\nin New York. Just fancy what the dear old Herald would have made out of\na little transaction like yours of last night.'\n\n'That's true,' assented Racksole. 'But it'll be all over New York to-\nmorrow morning, all the same. The worst of it is that Babylon has gone\noff to Switzerland.'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'Don't know. Sudden fancy, I guess, for his native heath.'\n\n'What difference does it make to you?'\n\n'None. Only I feel sort of lonesome. I feel I want someone to lean up\nagainst in running this h\u00c3\u00b4tel.'\n\n'Father, if you have that feeling you must be getting ill.'\n\n'Yes,' he sighed, 'I admit it's unusual with me. But perhaps you haven't\ngrasped the fact, Nella, that we're in the middle of a rather queer\nbusiness.'\n\n'You mean about poor Mr Dimmock?'\n\n'Partly Dimmock and partly other things. First of all, that Miss\nSpencer, or whatever her wretched name is, mysteriously disappears. Then\nthere was the stone thrown into your bedroom. Then I caught that rascal\nJules conspiring with Dimmock at three o'clock in the morning. Then your\nprecious Prince Aribert arrives without any suite--which I believe is a\nmost peculiar and wicked thing for a Prince to do--and moreover I find\nmy daughter on very intimate terms with the said Prince. Then young\nDimmock goes and dies, and there is to be an inquest; then Prince Eugen\nand his suite, who were expected here for dinner, fail to turn up at\nall--'\n\n'Prince Eugen has not come?'\n\n'He has not; and Uncle Aribert is in a deuce of a stew about him, and\ntelegraphing all over Europe. Altogether, things are working up pretty\nlively.'\n\n'Do you really think, Dad, there was anything between Jules and poor Mr\nDimmock?'\n\n'Think! I know! I tell you I saw that scamp give Dimmock a wink last\nnight at dinner that might have meant--well!'\n\n'So you caught that wink, did you, Dad?'\n\n'Why, did you?'\n\n'Of course, Dad. I was going to tell you about it.'\n\nThe millionaire grunted.\n\n'Look here, Father,' Nella whispered suddenly, and pointed to the\nbalcony immediately below them. 'Who's that?' She indicated a man with a\nbald patch on the back of his head, who was propping himself up against\nthe railing of the balcony and gazing immovable into the ball-room.\n\n'Well, who is it?'\n\n'Isn't it Jules?'\n\n'Gemini! By the beard of the prophet, it is!'\n\n'Perhaps Mr Jules is a guest of Mrs Sampson Levi.'\n\n'Guest or no guest, he goes out of this h\u00c3\u00b4tel, even if I have to throw\nhim out myself.'\n\nTheodore Racksole disappeared without another word, and Nella followed\nhim.\n\nBut when the millionaire arrived on the balcony floor he could see\nnothing of Jules, neither there nor in the ball-room itself. Saying no\nword aloud, but quietly whispering wicked expletives, he searched\neverywhere in vain, and then, at last, by tortuous stairways and\ncorridors returned to his original post of observation, that he might\nsurvey the place anew from the vantage ground. To his surprise he found\na man in the dark little room, watching the scene of the ball as\nintently as he himself had been doing a few minutes before. Hearing\nfootsteps, the man turned with a start.\n\nIt was Jules.\n\nThe two exchanged glances in the half light for a second.\n\n'Good evening, Mr Racksole,' said Jules calmly. 'I must apologize for\nbeing here.'\n\n'Force of habit, I suppose,' said Theodore Racksole drily.\n\n'Just so, sir.'\n\n'I fancied I had forbidden you to re-enter this h\u00c3\u00b4tel?'\n\n'I thought your order applied only to my professional capacity. I am\nhere to-night as the guest of Mr and Mrs Sampson Levi.'\n\n'In your new r\u00c3\u00b4le of man-about-town, eh?'\n\n'Exactly.'\n\n'But I don't allow men-about-town up here, my friend.'\n\n'For being up here I have already apologized.'\n\n'Then, having apologized, you had better depart; that is my\ndisinterested advice to you.'\n\n'Good night, sir.'\n\n'And, I say, Mr Jules, if Mr and Mrs Sampson Levi, or any other Hebrews\nor Christians, should again invite you to my h\u00c3\u00b4tel you will oblige me by\ndeclining the invitation. You'll find that will be the safest course for\nyou.'\n\n'Good night, sir.'\n\nBefore midnight struck Theodore Racksole had ascertained that the\ninvitation-list of Mr and Mrs Sampson Levi, though a somewhat lengthy\none, contained no reference to any such person as Jules.\n\nHe sat up very late. To be precise, he sat up all night. He was a man\nwho, by dint of training, could comfortably dispense with sleep when he\nfelt so inclined, or when circumstances made such a course advisable. He\nwalked to and fro in his room, and cogitated as few people beside\nTheodore Racksole could cogitate. At 6 a.m. he took a stroll round the\nbusiness part of his premises, and watched the supplies come in from\nCovent Garden, from Smithfield, from Billingsgate, and from other\nstrange places. He found the proceedings of the kitchen department quite\ninteresting, and made mental notes of things that he would have altered,\nof men whose wages he would increase and men whose wages he would\nreduce. At 7 a.m. he happened to be standing near the luggage lift, and\nwitnessed the descent of vast quantities of luggage, and its\ndisappearance into a Carter Paterson van.\n\n'Whose luggage is that?' he inquired peremptorily.\n\nThe luggage clerk, with an aggrieved expression, explained to him that\nit was the luggage of nobody in particular, that it belonged to various\nguests, and was bound for various destinations; that it was, in fact,\n'expressed' luggage despatched in advance, and that a similar quantity\nof it left the h\u00c3\u00b4tel every morning about that hour.\n\nTheodore Racksole walked away, and breakfasted upon one cup of tea and\nhalf a slice of toast.\n\nAt ten o'clock he was informed that the inspector of police desired to\nsee him. The inspector had come, he said, to superintend the removal of\nthe body of Reginald Dimmock to the mortuary adjoining the place of\ninquest, and a suitable vehicle waited at the back entrance of the\nh\u00c3\u00b4tel.\n\nThe inspector had also brought subpoenas for himself and Prince Aribert\nof Posen and the commissionaire to attend the inquest.\n\n'I thought Mr Dimmock's remains were removed last night,' said Racksole\nwearily.\n\n'No, sir. The fact is the van was engaged on another job.'\n\nThe inspector gave the least hint of a professional smile, and Racksole,\ndisgusted, told him curtly to go and perform his duties.\n\nIn a few minutes a message came from the inspector requesting Mr\nRacksole to be good enough to come to him on the first floor. Racksole\nwent. In the ante-room, where the body of Reginald Dimmock had\noriginally been placed, were the inspector and Prince Aribert, and two\npolicemen.\n\n'Well?' said Racksole, after he and the Prince had exchanged bows. Then\nhe saw a coffin laid across two chairs. 'I see a coffin has been\nobtained,' he remarked. 'Quite right' He approached it. 'It's empty,' he\nobserved unthinkingly.\n\n'Just so,' said the inspector. 'The body of the deceased has\ndisappeared.\n\nAnd his Serene Highness Prince Aribert informs me that though he has\noccupied a room immediately opposite, on the other side of the corridor,\nhe can throw no light on the affair.'\n\n'Indeed, I cannot!' said the Prince, and though he spoke with sufficient\ncalmness and dignity, you could see that he was deeply pained, even\ndistressed.\n\n'Well, I'm--' murmured Racksole, and stopped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Seven NELLA AND THE PRINCE\n\nIT appeared impossible to Theodore Racksole that so cumbrous an article\nas a corpse could be removed out of his h\u00c3\u00b4tel, with no trace, no hint,\nno clue as to the time or the manner of the performance of the deed.\nAfter the first feeling of surprise, Racksole grew coldly and severely\nangry. He had a mind to dismiss the entire staff of the h\u00c3\u00b4tel. He\npersonally examined the night-watchman, the chambermaids and all other\npersons who by chance might or ought to know something of the affair;\nbut without avail. The corpse of Reginald Dimmock had vanished utterly--\ndisappeared like a fleshless spirit.\n\nOf course there were the police. But Theodore Racksole held the police\nin sorry esteem. He acquainted them with the facts, answered their\nqueries with a patient weariness, and expected nothing whatever from\nthat quarter. He also had several interviews with Prince Aribert of\nPosen, but though the Prince was suavity itself and beyond doubt\ngenuinely concerned about the fate of his dead attendant, yet it seemed\nto Racksole that he was keeping something back, that he hesitated to say\nall he knew. Racksole, with characteristic insight, decided that the\ndeath of Reginald Dimmock was only a minor event, which had occurred, as\nit were, on the fringe of some far more profound mystery. And,\ntherefore, he decided to wait, with his eyes very wide open, until\nsomething else happened that would throw light on the business. At the\nmoment he took only one measure--he arranged that the theft of Dimmock's\nbody should not appear in the newspapers. It is astonishing how well a\nsecret can be kept, when the possessors of the secret are handled with\nthe proper mixture of firmness and persuasion. Racksole managed this\nvery neatly. It was a complicated job, and his success in it rather\npleased him.\n\nAt the same time he was conscious of being temporarily worsted by an\nunknown group of schemers, in which he felt convinced that Jules was an\nimportant item. He could scarcely look Nella in the eyes. The girl had\nevidently expected him to unmask this conspiracy at once, with a single\nstroke of the millionaire's magic wand. She was thoroughly accustomed,\nin the land of her birth, to seeing him achieve impossible feats. Over\nthere he was a 'boss'; men trembled before his name; when he wished a\nthing to happen--well, it happened; if he desired to know a thing, he\njust knew it. But here, in London, Theodore Racksole was not quite the\nsame Theodore Racksole. He dominated New York; but London, for the most\npart, seemed not to take much interest in him; and there were certainly\nvarious persons in London who were capable of snapping their fingers at\nhim--at Theodore Racksole. Neither he nor his daughter could get used to\nthat fact.\n\nAs for Nella, she concerned herself for a little with the ordinary\nbusiness of the bureau, and watched the incomings and outgoings of\nPrince Aribert with a kindly interest. She perceived, what her father\nhad failed to perceive, that His Highness had assumed an attitude of\nreserve merely to hide the secret distraction and dismay which consumed\nhim. She saw that the poor fellow had no settled plan in his head, and\nthat he was troubled by something which, so far, he had confided to\nnobody. It came to her knowledge that each morning he walked to and fro\non the Victoria Embankment, alone, and apparently with no object. On the\nthird morning she decided that driving exercise on the Embankment would\nbe good for her health, and thereupon ordered a carriage and issued\nforth, arrayed in a miraculous putty-coloured gown. Near Blackfriars\nBridge she met the Prince, and the carriage was drawn up by the\npavement.\n\n'Good morning, Prince,' she greeted him. 'Are you mistaking this for\nHyde Park?'\n\nHe bowed and smiled.\n\n'I usually walk here in the mornings,' he said.\n\n'You surprise me,' she returned. 'I thought I was the only person in\nLondon who preferred the Embankment, with this view of the river, to the\ndustiness of Hyde Park. I can't imagine how it is that London will never\ntake exercise anywhere except in that ridiculous Park. Now, if they had\nCentral Park--'\n\n'I think the Embankment is the finest spot in all London,' he said.\n\nShe leaned a little out of the landau, bringing her face nearer to his.\n\n'I do believe we are kindred spirits, you and I,' she murmured; and\nthen, 'Au revoir, Prince!'\n\n'One moment, Miss Racksole.' His quick tones had a note of entreaty.\n\n'I am in a hurry,' she fibbed; 'I am not merely taking exercise this\nmorning. You have no idea how busy we are.'\n\n'Ah! then I will not trouble you. But I leave the Grand Babylon to-\nnight.'\n\n'Do you?' she said. 'Then will your Highness do me the honour of\nlunching with me today in Father's room? Father will be out--he is\nhaving a day in the City with some stockbroking persons.'\n\n'I shall be charmed,' said the Prince, and his face showed that he meant\nit.\n\nNella drove off.\n\nIf the lunch was a success that result was due partly to Rocco, and\npartly to Nella. The Prince said little beyond what the ordinary rules\nof the conversational game demanded. His hostess talked much and talked\nwell, but she failed to rouse her guest. When they had had coffee he\ntook a rather formal leave of her.\n\n'Good-bye, Prince,' she said, 'but I thought--that is, no I didn't.\n\nGood-bye.'\n\n'You thought I wished to discuss something with you. I did; but I have\ndecided that I have no right to burden your mind with my affairs.'\n\n'But suppose--suppose I wish to be burdened?'\n\n'That is your good nature.'\n\n'Sit down,' she said abruptly, 'and tell me everything; mind,\neverything. I adore secrets.'\n\nAlmost before he knew it he was talking to her, rapidly, eagerly.\n\n'Why should I weary you with my confidences?' he said. 'I don't know, I\ncannot tell; but I feel that I must. I feel that you will understand me\nbetter than anyone else in the world. And yet why should you understand\nme? Again, I don't know. Miss Racksole, I will disclose to you the whole\ntrouble in a word. Prince Eugen, the hereditary Grand Duke of Posen, has\ndisappeared. Four days ago I was to have met him at Ostend. He had\naffairs in London. He wished me to come with him. I sent Dimmock on in\nfront, and waited for Eugen. He did not arrive. I telegraphed back to\nCologne, his last stopping-place, and I learned that he had left there\nin accordance with his programme; I learned also that he had passed\nthrough Brussels. It must have been between Brussels and the railway\nstation at Ostend Quay that he disappeared. He was travelling with a\nsingle equerry, and the equerry, too, has vanished. I need not explain\nto you, Miss Racksole, that when a person of the importance of my nephew\ncontrives to get lost one must proceed cautiously. One cannot advertise\nfor him in the London Times. Such a disappearance must be kept secret.\nThe people at Posen and at Berlin believe that Eugen is in London, here,\nat this h\u00c3\u00b4tel; or, rather, they did so believe. But this morning I\nreceived a cypher telegram from--from His Majesty the Emperor, a very\npeculiar telegram, asking when Eugen might be expected to return to\nPosen, and requesting that he should go first to Berlin. That telegram\nwas addressed to myself. Now, if the Emperor thought that Eugen was\nhere, why should he have caused the telegram to be addressed to me? I\nhave hesitated for three days, but I can hesitate no longer. I must\nmyself go to the Emperor and acquaint him with the facts.'\n\n'I suppose you've just got to keep straight with him?' Nella was on the\npoint of saying, but she checked herself and substituted, 'The Emperor\nis your chief, is he not? \"First among equals\", you call him.'\n\n'His Majesty is our over-lord,' said Aribert quietly.\n\n'Why do you not take immediate steps to inquire as to the whereabouts of\nyour Royal nephew?' she asked simply. The affair seemed to her just then\nso plain and straightforward.\n\n'Because one of two things may have happened. Either Eugen may have\nbeen, in plain language, abducted, or he may have had his own reasons\nfor changing his programme and keeping in the background--out of reach\nof telegraph and post and railways.'\n\n'What sort of reasons?'\n\n'Do not ask me. In the history of every family there are passages--' He\nstopped.\n\n'And what was Prince Eugen's object in coming to London?'\n\nAribert hesitated.\n\n'Money,' he said at length. 'As a family we are very poor--poorer than\nanyone in Berlin suspects.'\n\n'Prince Aribert,' Nella said, 'shall I tell you what I think?' She\nleaned back in her chair, and looked at him out of half-closed eyes. His\npale, thin, distinguished face held her gaze as if by some fascination.\nThere could be no mistaking this man for anything else but a Prince.\n\n'If you will,' he said.\n\n'Prince Eugen is the victim of a plot.'\n\n'You think so?'\n\n'I am perfectly convinced of it.'\n\n'But why? What can be the object of a plot against him?'\n\n'That is a point of which you should know more than me,' she remarked\ndrily.\n\n'Ah! Perhaps, perhaps,' he said. 'But, dear Miss Racksole, why are you\nso sure?'\n\n'There are several reasons, and they are connected with Mr Dimmock. Did\nyou ever suspect, your Highness, that that poor young man was not\nentirely loyal to you?'\n\n'He was absolutely loyal,' said the Prince, with all the earnestness of\nconviction.\n\n'A thousand pardons, but he was not.'\n\n'Miss Racksole, if any other than yourself made that assertion, I would-\n-I would--'\n\n'Consign them to the deepest dungeon in Posen?' she laughed, lightly.\n\n'Listen.' And she told him of the incidents which had occurred in the\nnight preceding his arrival in the h\u00c3\u00b4tel.\n\n'Do you mean, Miss Racksole, that there was an understanding between\npoor Dimmock and this fellow Jules?'\n\n'There was an understanding.'\n\n'Impossible!'\n\n'Your Highness, the man who wishes to probe a mystery to its root never\nuses the word \"impossible\". But I will say this for young Mr Dimmock. I\nthink he repented, and I think that it was because he repented that he--\ner--died so suddenly, and that his body was spirited away.'\n\n'Why has no one told me these things before?' Aribert exclaimed.\n\n'Princes seldom hear the truth,' she said.\n\nHe was astonished at her coolness, her firmness of assertion, her air of\ncomplete acquaintance with the world.\n\n'Miss Racksole,' he said, 'if you will permit me to say it, I have never\nin my life met a woman like you. May I rely on your sympathy--your\nsupport?'\n\n'My support, Prince? But how?'\n\n'I do not know,' he replied. 'But you could help me if you would. A\nwoman, when she has brain, always has more brain than a man.'\n\n'Ah!' she said ruefully, 'I have no brains, but I do believe I could\nhelp you.'\n\nWhat prompted her to make that assertion she could not have explained,\neven to herself. But she made it, and she had a suspicion--a prescience-\n-that it would be justified, though by what means, through what good\nfortune, was still a mystery to her.\n\n'Go to Berlin,' she said. 'I see that you must do that; you have no\nalternative. As for the rest, we shall see. Something will occur. I\nshall be here. My father will be here. You must count us as your\nfriends.'\n\nHe kissed her hand when he left, and afterwards, when she was alone, she\nkissed the spot his lips had touched again and again. Now, thinking the\nmatter out in the calmness of solitude, all seemed strange, unreal,\nuncertain to her. Were conspiracies actually possible nowadays? Did\nqueer things actually happen in Europe? And did they actually happen in\nLondon h\u00c3\u00b4tels? She dined with her father that night.\n\n'I hear Prince Aribert has left,' said Theodore Racksole.\n\n'Yes,' she assented. She said not a word about their interview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Eight ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE OF THE BARONESS\n\nON the following morning, just before lunch, a lady, accompanied by a\nmaid and a considerable quantity of luggage, came to the Grand Babylon\nH\u00c3\u00b4tel. She was a plump, little old lady, with white hair and an old-\nfashioned bonnet, and she had a quaint, simple smile of surprise at\neverything in general.\n\nNevertheless, she gave the impression of belonging to some aristocracy,\nthough not the English aristocracy. Her tone to her maid, whom she\naddressed in broken English--the girl being apparently English--was\ndistinctly insolent, with the calm, unconscious insolence peculiar to a\ncertain type of Continental nobility. The name on the lady's card ran\nthus: 'Baroness Zerlinski'. She desired rooms on the third floor. It\nhappened that Nella was in the bureau.\n\n'On the third floor, madam?' questioned Nella, in her best clerkly\nmanner.\n\n'I did say on de tird floor,' said the plump little old lady.\n\n'We have accommodation on the second floor.'\n\n'I wish to be high up, out of de dust and in de light,' explained the\nBaroness.\n\n'We have no suites on the third floor, madam.'\n\n'Never mind, no mattaire! Have you not two rooms that communicate?'\n\nNella consulted her books, rather awkwardly.\n\n'Numbers 122 and 123 communicate.'\n\n'Or is it 121 and 122?' the little old lady remarked quickly, and then\nbit her lip.\n\n'I beg your pardon. I should have said 121 and 122.'\n\nAt the moment Nella regarded the Baroness's correction of her figures as\na curious chance, but afterwards, when the Baroness had ascended in the\nlift, the thing struck her as somewhat strange. Perhaps the Baroness\nZerlinski had stayed at the h\u00c3\u00b4tel before. For the sake of convenience an\nindex of visitors to the h\u00c3\u00b4tel was kept and the index extended back for\nthirty years. Nella examined it, but it did not contain the name of\nZerlinski. Then it was that Nella began to imagine, what had swiftly\ncrossed her mind when first the Baroness presented herself at the\nbureau, that the features of the Baroness were remotely familiar to her.\nShe thought, not that she had seen the old lady's face before, but that\nshe had seen somewhere, some time, a face of a similar cast. It occurred\nto Nella to look at the 'Almanach de Gotha'--that record of all the\nmazes of Continental blue blood; but the 'Almanach de Gotha' made no\nreference to any barony of Zerlinski. Nella inquired where the Baroness\nmeant to take lunch, and was informed that a table had been reserved for\nher in the dining-room, and she at once decided to lunch in the dining-\nroom herself. Seated in a corner, half-hidden by a pillar, she could\nsurvey all the guests, and watch each group as it entered or left.\nPresently the Baroness appeared, dressed in black, with a tiny lace\nshawl, despite the June warmth; very stately, very quaint, and gently\nsmiling. Nella observed her intently. The lady ate heartily, working\nwithout haste and without delay through the elaborate menu of the\nluncheon. Nella noticed that she had beautiful white teeth. Then a\nremarkable thing happened. A cream puff was served to the Baroness by\nway of sweets, and Nella was astonished to see the little lady remove\nthe top, and with a spoon quietly take something from the interior which\nlooked like a piece of folded paper. No one who had not been watching\nwith the eye of a lynx would have noticed anything extraordinary in the\naction; indeed, the chances were nine hundred and ninety-nine to one\nthat it would pass unheeded. But, unfortunately for the Baroness, it was\nthe thousandth chance that happened. Nella jumped up, and walking over\nto the Baroness, said to her:\n\n'I'm afraid that the tart is not quite nice, your ladyship.'\n\n'Thanks, it is delightful,' said the Baroness coldly; her smile had\nvanished. 'Who are you? I thought you were de bureau clerk.'\n\n'My father is the owner of this h\u00c3\u00b4tel. I thought there was something in\nthe tart which ought not to have been there.'\n\nNella looked the Baroness full in the face. The piece of folded paper,\nto which a little cream had attached itself, lay under the edge of a\nplate.\n\n'No, thanks.' The Baroness smiled her simple smile.\n\nNella departed. She had noticed one trifling thing besides the paper--\nnamely, that the Baroness could pronounce the English 'th' sound if she\nchose.\n\nThat afternoon, in her own room, Nella sat meditating at the window for\nlong time, and then she suddenly sprang up, her eyes brightening.\n\n'I know,' she exclaimed, clapping her hands. 'It's Miss Spencer,\ndisguised!\n\nWhy didn't I think of that before?' Her thoughts ran instantly to Prince\nAribert. 'Perhaps I can help him,' she said to herself, and gave a\nlittle sigh. She went down to the office and inquired whether the\nBaroness had given any instructions about dinner. She felt that some\nplan must be formulated. She wanted to get hold of Rocco, and put him in\nthe rack. She knew now that Rocco, the unequalled, was also concerned in\nthis mysterious affair.\n\n'The Baroness Zerlinski has left, about a quarter of an hour ago,' said\nthe attendant.\n\n'But she only arrived this morning.'\n\n'The Baroness's maid said that her mistress had received a telegram and\nmust leave at once. The Baroness paid the bill, and went away in a four-\nwheeler.'\n\n'Where to?'\n\n'The trunks were labelled for Ostend.'\n\nPerhaps it was instinct, perhaps it was the mere spirit of adventure;\nbut that evening Nella was to be seen of all men on the steamer for\nOstend which leaves Dover at 11 p.m. She told no one of her intentions--\nnot even her father, who was not in the h\u00c3\u00b4tel when she left. She had\nscribbled a brief note to him to expect her back in a day or two, and\nhad posted this at Dover. The steamer was the Marie Henriette, a large\nand luxurious boat, whose state-rooms on deck vie with the glories of\nthe Cunard and White Star liners. One of these state-rooms, the best,\nwas evidently occupied, for every curtain of its windows was carefully\ndrawn. Nella did not hope that the Baroness was on board; it was quite\npossible for the Baroness to have caught the eight o'clock steamer, and\nit was also possible for the Baroness not to have gone to Ostend at all,\nbut to some other place in an entirely different direction.\nNevertheless, Nella had a faint hope that the lady who called herself\nZerlinski might be in that curtained stateroom, and throughout the\nsmooth moonlit voyage she never once relaxed her observation of its\ndoors and its windows.\n\nThe Maria Henriette arrived in Ostend Harbour punctually at 2 a.m. in\nthe morning. There was the usual heterogeneous, gesticulating crowd on\nthe quay.\n\nNella kept her post near the door of the state-room, and at length she\nwas rewarded by seeing it open. Four middle-aged Englishmen issued from\nit. From a glimpse of the interior Nella saw that they had spent the\nvoyage in card-playing.\n\nIt would not be too much to say that she was distinctly annoyed. She\npretended to be annoyed with circumstances, but really she was annoyed\nwith Nella Racksole. At two in the morning, without luggage, without any\ncompanionship, and without a plan of campaign, she found herself in a\nstrange foreign port--a port of evil repute, possessing some of the\nworst-managed h\u00c3\u00b4tels in Europe. She strolled on the quay for a few\nminutes, and then she saw the smoke of another steamer in the offing.\nShe inquired from an official what that steamer might be, and was told\nthat it was the eight o'clock from Dover, which had broken down, put\ninto Calais for some slight necessary repairs, and was arriving at its\ndestination nearly four hours late. Her mercurial spirits rose again. A\nminute ago she was regarding herself as no better than a ninny engaged\nin a wild-goose chase. Now she felt that after all she had been very\nsagacious and cunning. She was morally sure that she would find the\nZerlinski woman on this second steamer, and she took all the credit to\nherself in advance. Such is human nature.\n\nThe steamer seemed interminably slow in coming into harbour. Nella\nwalked on the Digue for a few minutes to watch it the better. The town\nwas silent and almost deserted. It had a false and sinister aspect. She\nremembered tales which she had heard of this glittering resort, which in\nthe season holds more scoundrels than any place in Europe, save only\nMonte Carlo. She remembered that the gilded adventures of every nation\nunder the sun forgathered there either for business or pleasure, and\nthat some of the most wonderful crimes of the latter half of the century\nhad been schemed and matured in that haunt of cosmopolitan iniquity.\n\nWhen the second steamer arrived Nella stood at the end of the gangway,\nclose to the ticket-collector. The first person to step on shore was--\nnot the Baroness Zerlinski, but Miss Spencer herself! Nella turned aside\ninstantly, hiding her face, and Miss Spencer, carrying a small bag,\nhurried with assured footsteps to the Custom House. It seemed as if she\nknew the port of Ostend fairly well. The moon shone like day, and Nella\nhad full opportunity to observe her quarry. She could see now quite\nplainly that the Baroness Zerlinski had been only Miss Spencer in\ndisguise. There was the same gait, the same movement of the head and of\nthe hips; the white hair was easily to be accounted for by a wig, and\nthe wrinkles by a paint brush and some grease paints. Miss Spencer,\nwhose hair was now its old accustomed yellow, got through the Custom\nHouse without difficulty, and Nella saw her call a closed carriage and\nsay something to the driver. The vehicle drove off. Nella jumped into\nthe next carriage--an open one--that came up.\n\n'Follow that carriage,' she said succinctly to the driver in French.\n\n'Bien, madame!' The driver whipped up his horse, and the animal shot\nforward with a terrific clatter over the cobbles. It appeared that this\ndriver was quite accustomed to following other carriages.\n\n'Now I am fairly in for it!' said Nella to herself. She laughed\nunsteadily, but her heart was beating with an extraordinary thump.\n\nFor some time the pursued vehicle kept well in front. It crossed the\ntown nearly from end to end, and plunged into a maze of small streets\nfar on the south side of the Kursaal. Then gradually Nella's equipage\nbegan to overtake it. The first carriage stopped with a jerk before a\ntall dark house, and Miss Spencer emerged. Nella called to her driver to\nstop, but he, determined to be in at the death, was engaged in whipping\nhis horse, and he completely ignored her commands. He drew up\ntriumphantly at the tall dark house just at the moment when Miss Spencer\ndisappeared into it. The other carriage drove away. Nella, uncertain\nwhat to do, stepped down from her carriage and gave the driver some\nmoney. At the same moment a man reopened the door of the house, which\nhad closed on Miss Spencer.\n\n'I want to see Miss Spencer,' said Nella impulsively. She couldn't think\nof anything else to say.\n\n'Miss Spencer?'\n\n'Yes; she's just arrived.'\n\n'It's O.K., I suppose,' said the man.\n\n'I guess so,' said Nella, and she walked past him into the house. She\nwas astonished at her own audacity.\n\nMiss Spencer was just going into a room off the narrow hall. Nella\nfollowed her into the apartment, which was shabbily furnished in the\nBelgian lodging-house style.\n\n'Well, Miss Spencer,' she greeted the former Baroness Zerlinski, 'I\nguess you didn't expect to see me. You left our h\u00c3\u00b4tel very suddenly this\nafternoon, and you left it very suddenly a few days ago; and so I've\njust called to make a few inquiries.'\n\nTo do the lady justice, Miss Spencer bore the surprising ordeal very\nwell.\n\nShe did not flinch; she betrayed no emotion. The sole sign of\nperturbation was in her hurried breathing.\n\n'You have ceased to be the Baroness Zerlinski,' Nella continued. 'May I\nsit down?'\n\n'Certainly, sit down,' said Miss Spencer, copying the girl's tone. 'You\nare a fairly smart young woman, that I will say. What do you want?\nWeren't my books all straight?'\n\n'Your books were all straight. I haven't come about your books. I have\ncome about the murder of Reginald Dimmock, the disappearance of his\ncorpse, and the disappearance of Prince Eugen of Posen. I thought you\nmight be able to help me in some investigations which I am making.'\n\nMiss Spencer's eyes gleamed, and she stood up and moved swiftly to the\nmantelpiece.\n\n'You may be a Yankee, but you're a fool,' she said.\n\nShe took hold of the bell-rope.\n\n'Don't ring that bell if you value your life,' said Nella.\n\n'If what?' Miss Spencer remarked.\n\n'If you value your life,' said Nella calmly, and with the words she\npulled from her pocket a very neat and dainty little revolver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Nine TWO WOMEN AND THE REVOLVER\n\n'YOU--you're only doing that to frighten me,' stammered Miss Spencer, in\na low, quavering voice.\n\n'Am I?' Nella replied, as firmly as she could, though her hand shook\nviolently with excitement, could Miss Spencer but have observed it. 'Am\nI? You said just now that I might be a Yankee girl, but I was a fool.\nWell, I am a Yankee girl, as you call it; and in my country, if they\ndon't teach revolver-shooting in boarding-schools, there are at least a\nlot of girls who can handle a revolver. I happen to be one of them. I\ntell you that if you ring that bell you will suffer.'\n\nMost of this was simple bluff on Nella's part, and she trembled lest\nMiss Spencer should perceive that it was simple bluff. Happily for her,\nMiss Spencer belonged to that order of women who have every sort of\ncourage except physical courage. Miss Spencer could have withstood\nsuccessfully any moral trial, but persuade her that her skin was in\ndanger, and she would succumb. Nella at once divined this useful fact,\nand proceeded accordingly, hiding the strangeness of her own sensations\nas well as she could.\n\n'You had better sit down now,' said Nella, 'and I will ask you a few\nquestions.'\n\nAnd Miss Spencer obediently sat down, rather white, and trying to screw\nher lips into a formal smile.\n\n'Why did you leave the Grand Babylon that night?' Nella began her\nexamination, putting on a stern, barrister-like expression.\n\n'I had orders to, Miss Racksole.'\n\n'Whose orders?'\n\n'Well, I'm--I'm--the fact is, I'm a married woman, and it was my\nhusband's orders.'\n\n'Who is your husband?'\n\n'Tom Jackson--Jules, you know, head waiter at the Grand Babylon.'\n\n'So Jules's real name is Tom Jackson? Why did he want you to leave\nwithout giving notice?'\n\n'I'm sure I don't know, Miss Racksole. I swear I don't know. He's my\nhusband, and, of course, I do what he tells me, as you will some day do\nwhat your husband tells you. Please heaven you'll get a better husband\nthan mine!'\n\nMiss Spencer showed a sign of tears.\n\nNella fingered the revolver, and put it at full cock. 'Well,' she\nrepeated, 'why did he want you to leave?' She was tremendously surprised\nat her own coolness, and somewhat pleased with it, too.\n\n'I can't tell you, I can't tell you.'\n\n'You've just got to,' Nella said, in a terrible, remorseless tone.\n\n'He--he wished me to come over here to Ostend. Something had gone wrong.\n\nOh! he's a fearful man, is Tom. If I told you, he'd--'\n\n'Had something gone wrong in the h\u00c3\u00b4tel, or over here?'\n\n'Both.'\n\n'Was it about Prince Eugen of Posen?'\n\n'I don't know--that is, yes, I think so.'\n\n'What has your husband to do with Prince Eugen?'\n\n'I believe he has some--some sort of business with him, some money\nbusiness.'\n\n'And was Mr Dimmock in this business?'\n\n'I fancy so, Miss Racksole. I'm telling you all I know, that I swear.'\n\n'Did your husband and Mr Dimmock have a quarrel that night in Room 111?'\n\n'They had some difficulty.'\n\n'And the result of that was that you came to Ostend instantly?'\n\n'Yes; I suppose so.'\n\n'And what were you to do in Ostend? What were your instructions from\nthis husband of yours?'\n\nMiss Spencer's head dropped on her arms on the table which separated her\nfrom Nella, and she appeared to sob violently.\n\n'Have pity on me,' she murmured, 'I can't tell you any more.'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'He'd kill me if he knew.'\n\n'You're wandering from the subject,' observed Nella coldly. 'This is the\nlast time I shall warn you. Let me tell you plainly I've got the best\nreasons for being desperate, and if anything happens to you I shall say\nI did it in self-defence. Now, what were you to do in Ostend?'\n\n'I shall die for this anyhow,' whined Miss Spencer, and then, with a\nsort of fierce despair, 'I had to keep watch on Prince Eugen.'\n\n'Where? In this house?'\n\nMiss Spencer nodded, and, looking up, Nella could see the traces of\ntears in her face.\n\n'Then Prince Eugen was a prisoner? Some one had captured him at the\ninstigation of Jules?'\n\n'Yes, if you must have it.'\n\n'Why was it necessary for you specially to come to Ostend?'\n\n'Oh! Tom trusts me. You see, I know Ostend. Before I took that place at\nthe Grand Babylon I had travelled over Europe, and Tom knew that I knew\na thing or two.'\n\n'Why did you take the place at the Grand Babylon?'\n\n'Because Tom told me to. He said I should be useful to him there.'\n\n'Is your husband an Anarchist, or something of that kind, Miss Spencer?'\n\n'I don't know. I'd tell you in a minute if I knew. But he's one of those\nthat keep themselves to themselves.'\n\n'Do you know if he has ever committed a murder?'\n\n'Never!' said Miss Spencer, with righteous repudiation of the mere idea.\n\n'But Mr Dimmock was murdered. He was poisoned. If he had not been\npoisoned why was his body stolen? It must have been stolen to prevent\ninquiry, to hide traces. Tell me about that.'\n\n'I take my dying oath,' said Miss Spencer, standing up a little way from\nthe table, 'I take my dying oath I didn't know Mr Dimmock was dead till\nI saw it in the newspaper.'\n\n'You swear you had no suspicion of it?'\n\n'I swear I hadn't.'\n\nNella was inclined to believe the statement. The woman and the girl\nlooked at each other in the tawdry, frowsy, lamp-lit room. Miss Spencer\nnervously patted her yellow hair into shape, as if gradually recovering\nher composure and equanimity. The whole affair seemed like a dream to\nNella, a disturbing, sinister nightmare. She was a little uncertain what\nto say. She felt that she had not yet got hold of any very definite\ninformation. 'Where is Prince Eugen now?' she asked at length.\n\n'I don't know, miss.'\n\n'He isn't in this house?'\n\n'No, miss.'\n\n'Ah! We will see presently.'\n\n'They took him away, Miss Racksole.'\n\n'Who took him away? Some of your husband's friends?'\n\n'Some of his--acquaintances.'\n\n'Then there is a gang of you?'\n\n'A gang of us--a gang! I don't know what you mean,' Miss Spencer\nquavered.\n\n'Oh, but you must know,' smiled Nella calmly. 'You can't possibly be so\ninnocent as all that, Mrs Tom Jackson. You can't play games with me.\nYou've just got to remember that I'm what you call a Yankee girl.\nThere's one thing that I mean to find out, within the next five minutes,\nand that is--how your charming husband kidnapped Prince Eugen, and why\nhe kidnapped him. Let us begin with the second question. You have evaded\nit once.'\n\nMiss Spencer looked into Nella's face, and then her eyes dropped, and\nher fingers worked nervously with the tablecloth.\n\n'How can I tell you,' she said, 'when I don't know? You've got the whip-\nhand of me, and you're tormenting me for your own pleasure.' She wore an\nexpression of persecuted innocence.\n\n'Did Mr Tom Jackson want to get some money out of Prince Eugen?'\n\n'Money! Not he! Tom's never short of money.'\n\n'But I mean a lot of money--tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands?'\n\n'Tom never wanted money from anyone,' said Miss Spencer doggedly.\n\n'Then had he some reason for wishing to prevent Prince Eugen from coming\nto London?'\n\n'Perhaps he had. I don't know. If you kill me, I don't know.' Nella\nstopped to reflect. Then she raised the revolver. It was a mechanical,\nunintentional sort of action, and certainly she had no intention of\nusing the weapon, but, strange to say, Miss Spencer again cowered before\nit. Even at that moment Nella wondered that a woman like Miss Spencer\ncould be so simple as to think the revolver would actually be used.\nHaving absolutely no physical cowardice herself, Nella had the greatest\ndifficulty in imagining that other people could be at the mercy of a\nbodily fear. Still, she saw her advantage, and used it relentlessly, and\nwith as much theatrical gesture as she could command. She raised the\nrevolver till it was level with Miss Spencer's face, and suddenly a new,\nqueer feeling took hold of her. She knew that she would indeed use that\nrevolver now, if the miserable woman before her drove her too far. She\nfelt afraid--afraid of herself; she was in the grasp of a savage,\nprimeval instinct. In a flash she saw Miss Spencer dead at her feet--the\npolice--a court of justice--the scaffold. It was horrible.\n\n'Speak,' she said hoarsely, and Miss Spencer's face went whiter.\n\n'Tom did say,' the woman whispered rapidly, awesomely, 'that if Prince\nEugen got to London it would upset his scheme.'\n\n'What scheme? What scheme? Answer me.'\n\n'Heaven help me, I don't know.' Miss Spencer sank into a chair. 'He said\nMr Dimmock had turned tail, and he should have to settle him and then\nRocco--'\n\n'Rocco! What about Rocco?' Nella could scarcely hear herself. Her grip\nof the revolver tightened.\n\nMiss Spencer's eyes opened wider; she gazed at Nella with a glassy\nstare.\n\n'Don't ask me. It's death!' Her eyes were fixed as if in horror.\n\n'It is,' said Nella, and the sound of her voice seemed to her to issue\nfrom the lips of some third person.\n\n'It's death,' repeated Miss Spencer, and gradually her head and\nshoulders sank back, and hung loosely over the chair. Nella was\nconscious of a sudden revulsion. The woman had surely fainted. Dropping\nthe revolver she ran round the table. She was herself again--feminine,\nsympathetic, the old Nella. She felt immensely relieved that this had\nhappened. But at the same instant Miss Spencer sprang up from the chair\nlike a cat, seized the revolver, and with a wild movement of the arm\nflung it against the window. It crashed through the glass, exploding as\nit went, and there was a tense silence.\n\n'I told you that you were a fool,' remarked Miss Spencer slowly, 'coming\nhere like a sort of female Jack Sheppard, and trying to get the best of\nme.\n\nWe are on equal terms now. You frightened me, but I knew I was a\ncleverer woman than you, and that in the end, if I kept on long enough,\nI should win.\n\nNow it will be my turn.'\n\nDumbfounded, and overcome with a miserable sense of the truth of Miss\nSpencer's words, Nella stood still. The idea of her colossal foolishness\nswept through her like a flood. She felt almost ashamed. But even at\nthis juncture she had no fear. She faced the woman bravely, her mind\nleaping about in search of some plan. She could think of nothing but a\nbribe--an enormous bribe.\n\n'I admit you've won,' she said, 'but I've not finished yet. Just\nlisten.'\n\nMiss Spencer folded her arms, and glanced at the door, smiling bitterly.\n\n'You know my father is a millionaire; perhaps you know that he is one of\nthe richest men in the world. If I give you my word of honour not to\nreveal anything that you've told me, what will you take to let me go\nfree?'\n\n'What sum do you suggest?' asked Miss Spencer carelessly.\n\n'Twenty thousand pounds,' said Nella promptly. She had begun to regard\nthe affair as a business operation.\n\nMiss Spencer's lip curled.\n\n'A hundred thousand.'\n\nAgain Miss Spencer's lip curled.\n\n'Well, say a million. I can rely on my father, and so may you.'\n\n'You think you are worth a million to him?'\n\n'I do,' said Nella.\n\n'And you think we could trust you to see that it was paid?'\n\n'Of course you could.'\n\n'And we should not suffer afterwards in any way?'\n\n'I would give you my word, and my father's word.'\n\n'Bah!' exclaimed Miss Spencer: 'how do you know I wouldn't let you go\nfree for nothing? You are only a rash, silly girl.'\n\n'I know you wouldn't. I can read your face too well.'\n\n'You are right,' Miss Spencer replied slowly. 'I wouldn't. I wouldn't\nlet you go for all the dollars in America.'\n\nNella felt cold down the spine, and sat down again in her chair. A\ndraught of air from the broken window blew on her cheek. Steps sounded\nin the passage; the door opened, but Nella did not turn round. She could\nnot move her eyes from Miss Spencer's. There was a noise of rushing\nwater in her ears. She lost consciousness, and slipped limply to the\nground.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Ten AT SEA\n\nIT seemed to Nella that she was being rocked gently in a vast cradle,\nwhich swayed to and fro with a motion at once slow and incredibly\ngentle. This sensation continued for some time, and there was added to\nit the sound of a quick, quiet, muffled beat. Soft, exhilarating breezes\nwafted her forward in spite of herself, and yet she remained in a\ndelicious calm. She wondered if her mother was kneeling by her side,\nwhispering some lullaby in her childish ears. Then strange colours swam\nbefore her eyes, her eyelids wavered, and at last she awoke. For a few\nmoments her gaze travelled to and fro in a vain search for some clue to\nher surroundings, was aware of nothing except sense of repose and a\nfeeling of relief that some mighty and fatal struggle was over; she\ncared not whether she had conquered or suffered defeat in the struggle\nof her soul with some other soul; it was finished, done with, and the\nconsciousness of its conclusion satisfied and contented her. Gradually\nher brain, recovering from its obsession, began to grasp the phenomena\nof her surroundings, and she saw that she was on a yacht, and that the\nyacht was moving. The motion of the cradle was the smooth rolling of the\nvessel; the beat was the beat of its screw; the strange colours were the\ncloud tints thrown by the sun as it rose over a distant and receding\nshore in the wake of the yacht; her mother's lullaby was the crooned\nsong of the man at the wheel. Nella all through her life had had many\nexperiences of yachting. From the waters of the River Hudson to those\nbluer tides of the Mediterranean Sea, she had yachted in all seasons and\nall weathers. She loved the water, and now it seemed deliciously right\nand proper that she should be on the water again. She raised her head to\nlook round, and then let it sink back: she was fatigued, enervated; she\ndesired only solitude and calm; she had no care, no anxiety, no\nresponsibility: a hundred years might have passed since her meeting with\nMiss Spencer, and the memory of that meeting appeared to have faded into\nthe remotest background of her mind.\n\nIt was a small yacht, and her practised eye at once told that it\nbelonged to the highest aristocracy of pleasure craft. As she reclined\nin the deck-chair (it did not occur to her at that moment to speculate\nas to the identity of the person who had led her therein) she examined\nall visible details of the vessel. The deck was as white and smooth as\nher own hand, and the seams ran along its length like blue veins. All\nthe brass-work, from the band round the slender funnel to the concave\nsurface of the binnacle, shone like gold.\n\nThe tapered masts stretched upwards at a rakish angle, and the rigging\nseemed like spun silk. No sails were set; the yacht was under steam, and\ndoing about seven or eight knots. She judged that it was a boat of a\nhundred tons or so, probably Clyde-built, and not more than two or three\nyears old.\n\nNo one was to be seen on deck except the man at the wheel: this man wore\na blue jersey; but there was neither name nor initial on the jersey, nor\nwas there a name on the white life-buoys lashed to the main rigging, nor\non the polished dinghy which hung on the starboard davits. She called to\nthe man, and called again, in a feeble voice, but the steerer took no\nnotice of her, and continued his quiet song as though nothing else\nexisted in the universe save the yacht, the sea, the sun, and himself.\n\nThen her eyes swept the outline of the land from which they were\nhastening, and she could just distinguish a lighthouse and a great white\nirregular dome, which she recognized as the Kursaal at Ostend, that\ngorgeous rival of the gaming palace at Monte Carlo. So she was leaving\nOstend. The rays of the sun fell on her caressingly, like a restorative.\nAll around the water was changing from wonderful greys and dark blues to\nstill more wonderful pinks and translucent unearthly greens; the magic\nkaleidoscope of dawn was going forward in its accustomed way, regardless\nof the vicissitudes of mortals.\n\nHere and there in the distance she descried a sail--the brown sail of\nsome Ostend fishing-boat returning home after a night's trawling. Then\nthe beat of paddles caught her ear, and a steamer blundered past,\nwallowing clumsily among the waves like a tortoise. It was the Swallow\nfrom London. She could see some of its passengers leaning curiously over\nthe aft-rail. A girl in a mackintosh signalled to her, and mechanically\nshe answered the salute with her arm. The officer of the bridge of the\nSwallow hailed the yacht, but the man at the wheel offered no reply. In\nanother minute the Swallow was nothing but a blot in the distance.\n\nNella tried to sit straight in the deck-chair, but she found herself\nunable to do so. Throwing off the rug which covered her, she discovered\nthat she had been tied to the chair by means of a piece of broad\nwebbing. Instantly she was alert, awake, angry; she knew that her perils\nwere not over; she felt that possibly they had scarcely yet begun. Her\nlazy contentment, her dreamy sense of peace and repose, vanished\nutterly, and she steeled herself to meet the dangers of a grave and\ndifficult situation.\n\nJust at that moment a man came up from below. He was a man of forty or\nso, clad in irreproachable blue, with a peaked yachting cap. He raised\nthe cap politely.\n\n'Good morning,' he said. 'Beautiful sunrise, isn't it?' The clever and\ncalculated insolence of his tone cut her like a lash as she lay bound in\nthe chair. Like all people who have lived easy and joyous lives in those\nfair regions where gold smoothes every crease and law keeps a tight hand\non disorder, she found it hard to realize that there were other regions\nwhere gold was useless and law without power. Twenty-four hours ago she\nwould have declared it impossible that such an experience as she had\nsuffered could happen to anyone; she would have talked airily about\ncivilization and the nineteenth century, and progress and the police.\nBut her experience was teaching her that human nature remains always the\nsame, and that beneath the thin crust of security on which we good\ncitizens exist the dark and secret forces of crime continue to move,\njust as they did in the days when you couldn't go from Cheapside to\nChelsea without being set upon by thieves. Her experience was in a fair\nway to teach her this lesson better than she could have learnt it even\nin the bureaux of the detective police of Paris, London, and St\nPetersburg.\n\n'Good morning,' the man repeated, and she glanced at him with a sullen,\nangry gaze.\n\n'You!' she exclaimed, 'You, Mr Thomas Jackson, if that is your name!\nLoose me from this chair, and I will talk to you.' Her eyes flashed as\nshe spoke, and the contempt in them added mightily to her beauty. Mr\nThomas Jackson, otherwise Jules, erstwhile head waiter at the Grand\nBabylon, considered himself a connoisseur in feminine loveliness, and\nthe vision of Nella Racksole smote him like an exquisite blow.\n\n'With pleasure,' he replied. 'I had forgotten that to prevent you from\nfalling I had secured you to the chair'; and with a quick movement he\nunfastened the band. Nella stood up, quivering with fiery annoyance and\nscorn.\n\n'Now,' she said, fronting him, 'what is the meaning of this?'\n\n'You fainted,' he replied imperturbably. 'Perhaps you don't remember.'\n\nThe man offered her a deck-chair with a characteristic gesture. Nella\nwas obliged to acknowledge, in spite of herself, that the fellow had\ndistinction, an air of breeding. No one would have guessed that for\ntwenty years he had been an h\u00c3\u00b4tel waiter. His long, lithe figure, and\neasy, careless carriage seemed to be the figure and carriage of an\naristocrat, and his voice was quiet, restrained, and authoritative.\n\n'That has nothing to do with my being carried off in this yacht of\nyours.'\n\n'It is not my yacht,' he said, 'but that is a minor detail. As to the\nmore important matter, forgive me that I remind you that only a few\nhours ago you were threatening a lady in my house with a revolver.'\n\n'Then it was your house?'\n\n'Why not? May I not possess a house?' He smiled.\n\n'I must request you to put the yacht about at once, instantly, and take\nme back.' She tried to speak firmly.\n\n'Ah!' he said, 'I am afraid that's impossible. I didn't put out to sea\nwith the intention of returning at once, instantly.' In the last words\nhe gave a faint imitation of her tone.\n\n'When I do get back,' she said, 'when my father gets to know of this\naffair, it will be an exceedingly bad day for you, Mr Jackson.'\n\n'But supposing your father doesn't hear of it--'\n\n'What?'\n\n'Supposing you never get back?'\n\n'Do you mean, then, to have my murder on your conscience?'\n\n'Talking of murder,' he said, 'you came very near to murdering my\nfriend, Miss Spencer. At least, so she tells me.'\n\n'Is Miss Spencer on board?' Nella asked, seeing perhaps a faint ray of\nhope in the possible presence of a woman.\n\n'Miss Spencer is not on board. There is no one on board except you and\nmyself and a small crew--a very discreet crew, I may add.'\n\n'I will have nothing more to say to you. You must take your own course.'\n\n'Thanks for the permission,' he said. 'I will send you up some\nbreakfast.'\n\nHe went to the saloon stairs and whistled, and a Negro boy appeared with\na tray of chocolate. Nella took it, and, without the slightest\nhesitation, threw it overboard. Mr Jackson walked away a few steps and\nthen returned.\n\n'You have spirit,' he said, 'and I admire spirit. It is a rare quality.'\n\nShe made no reply. 'Why did you mix yourself up in my affairs at all?'\nhe went on. Again she made no reply, but the question set her thinking:\nwhy had she mixed herself up in this mysterious business? It was quite\nat variance with the usual methods of her gay and butterfly existence to\nmeddle at all with serious things. Had she acted merely from a desire to\nsee justice done and wickedness punished? Or was it the desire of\nadventure? Or was it, perhaps, the desire to be of service to His Serene\nHighness Prince Aribert? 'It is no fault of mine that you are in this\nfix,' Jules continued. 'I didn't bring you into it. You brought yourself\ninto it. You and your father--you have been moving along at a pace which\nis rather too rapid.'\n\n'That remains to be seen,' she put in coldly.\n\n'It does,' he admitted. 'And I repeat that I can't help admiring you--\nthat is, when you aren't interfering with my private affairs. That is a\nproceeding which I have never tolerated from anyone--not even from a\nmillionaire, nor even from a beautiful woman.' He bowed. 'I will tell\nyou what I propose to do. I propose to escort you to a place of safety,\nand to keep you there till my operations are concluded, and the\npossibility of interference entirely removed. You spoke just now of\nmurder. What a crude notion that was of yours! It is only the amateur\nwho practises murder--'\n\n'What about Reginald Dimmock?' she interjected quickly.\n\nHe paused gravely.\n\n'Reginald Dimmock,' he repeated. 'I had imagined his was a case of heart\ndisease. Let me send you up some more chocolate. I'm sure you're\nhungry.'\n\n'I will starve before I touch your food,' she said.\n\n'Gallant creature!' he murmured, and his eyes roved over her face. Her\nsuperb, supercilious beauty overcame him. 'Ah!' he said, 'what a wife\nyou would make!' He approached nearer to her. 'You and I, Miss Racksole,\nyour beauty and wealth and my brains--we could conquer the world. Few\nmen are worthy of you, but I am one of the few. Listen! You might do\nworse. Marry me. I am a great man; I shall be greater. I adore you.\nMarry me, and I will save your life. All shall be well. I will begin\nagain. The past shall be as though there had been no past.'\n\n'This is somewhat sudden--Jules,' she said with biting contempt.\n\n'Did you expect me to be conventional?' he retorted. 'I love you.'\n\n'Granted,' she said, for the sake of the argument. 'Then what will occur\nto your present wife?'\n\n'My present wife?'\n\n'Yes, Miss Spencer, as she is called.'\n\n'She told you I was her husband?'\n\n'Incidentally she did.'\n\n'She isn't.'\n\n'Perhaps she isn't. But, nevertheless, I think I won't marry you.' Nella\nstood like a statue of scorn before him.\n\nHe went still nearer to her. 'Give me a kiss, then; one kiss--I won't\nask for more; one kiss from those lips, and you shall go free. Men have\nruined themselves for a kiss. I will.'\n\n'Coward!' she ejaculated.\n\n'Coward!' he repeated. 'Coward, am I? Then I'll be a coward, and you\nshall kiss me whether you will or not.'\n\nHe put a hand on her shoulder. As she shrank back from his lustrous\neyes, with an involuntary scream, a figure sprang out of the dinghy a\nfew feet away. With a single blow, neatly directed to Mr Jackson's ear,\nMr Jackson was stretched senseless on the deck. Prince Aribert of Posen\nstood over him with a revolver. It was probably the greatest surprise of\nMr Jackson's whole life.\n\n'Don't be alarmed,' said the Prince to Nella, 'my being here is the\nsimplest thing in the world, and I will explain it as soon as I have\nfinished with this fellow.'\n\nNella could think of nothing to say, but she noticed the revolver in the\nPrince's hand.\n\n'Why,' she remarked, 'that's my revolver.'\n\n'It is,' he said, 'and I will explain that, too.'\n\nThe man at the wheel gave no heed whatever to the scene.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Eleven THE COURT PAWNBROKER\n\n'MR SAMPSON LEVI wishes to see you, sir.'\n\nThese words, spoken by a servant to Theodore Racksole, aroused the\nmillionaire from a reverie which had been the reverse of pleasant. The\nfact was, and it is necessary to insist on it, that Mr Racksole, owner\nof the Grand Babylon H\u00c3\u00b4tel, was by no means in a state of self-\nsatisfaction. A mystery had attached itself to his h\u00c3\u00b4tel, and with all\nhis acumen and knowledge of things in general he was unable to solve\nthat mystery. He laughed at the fruitless efforts of the police, but he\ncould not honestly say that his own efforts had been less barren. The\npublic was talking, for, after all, the disappearance of poor Dimmock's\nbody had got noised abroad in an indirect sort of way, and Theodore\nRacksole did not like the idea of his impeccable h\u00c3\u00b4tel being the subject\nof sinister rumours. He wondered, grimly, what the public and the Sunday\nnewspapers would say if they were aware of all the other phenomena, not\nyet common property: of Miss Spencer's disappearance, of Jules' strange\nvisits, and of the non-arrival of Prince Eugen of Posen. Theodore\nRacksole had worried his brain without result. He had conducted an\nelaborate private investigation without result, and he had spent a\ncertain amount of money without result. The police said that they had a\nclue; but Racksole remarked that it was always the business of the\npolice to have a clue, that they seldom had more than a clue, and that a\nclue without some sequel to it was a pretty stupid business. The only\nsure thing in the whole affair was that a cloud rested over his h\u00c3\u00b4tel,\nhis beautiful new toy, the finest of its kind. The cloud was not\ninterfering with business, but, nevertheless, it was a cloud, and he\nfiercely resented its presence; perhaps it would be more correct to say\nthat he fiercely resented his inability to dissipate it.\n\n'Mr Sampson Levi wishes to see you, sir,' the servant repeated, having\nreceived no sign that his master had heard him.\n\n'So I hear,' said Racksole. 'Does he want to see me, personally?'\n\n'He asked for you, sir.'\n\n'Perhaps it is Rocco he wants to see, about a menu or something of that\nkind?'\n\n'I will inquire, sir,' and the servant made a move to withdraw.\n\n'Stop,' Racksole commanded suddenly. 'Desire Mr Sampson Levi to step\nthis way.'\n\nThe great stockbroker of the 'Kaffir Circus' entered with a simple\nunassuming air. He was a rather short, florid man, dressed like a\ntypical Hebraic financier, with too much watch-chain and too little\nwaistcoat. In his fat hand he held a gold-headed cane, and an absolutely\nnew silk hat--for it was Friday, and Mr Levi purchased a new hat every\nFriday of his life, holiday times only excepted. He breathed heavily and\nsniffed through his nose a good deal, as though he had just performed\nsome Herculean physical labour. He glanced at the American millionaire\nwith an expression in which a slight embarrassment might have been\ndetected, but at the same time his round, red face disclosed a certain\nfrank admiration and good nature.\n\n'Mr Racksole, I believe--Mr Theodore Racksole. Proud to meet you, sir.'\n\nSuch were the first words of Mr Sampson Levi. In form they were the\ngreeting of a third-rate chimney-sweep, but, strangely enough, Theodore\nRacksole liked their tone. He said to himself that here, precisely where\nno one would have expected to find one, was an honest man.\n\n'Good day,' said Racksole briefly. 'To what do I owe the pleasure--'\n\n'I expect your time is limited,' answered Sampson Levi. 'Anyhow, mine\nis, and so I'll come straight to the point, Mr Racksole. I'm a plain\nman. I don't pretend to be a gentleman or any nonsense of that kind. I'm\na stockbroker, that's what I am, and I don't care who knows it. The\nother night I had a ball in this h\u00c3\u00b4tel. It cost me a couple of thousand\nand odd pounds, and, by the way, I wrote out a cheque for your bill this\nmorning. I don't like balls, but they're useful to me, and my little\nwife likes 'em, and so we give 'em. Now, I've nothing to say against the\nh\u00c3\u00b4tel management as regards that ball: it was very decently done, very\ndecently, but what I want to know is this--Why did you have a private\ndetective among my guests?'\n\n'A private detective?' exclaimed Racksole, somewhat surprised at this\ncharge.\n\n'Yes,' Mr Sampson Levi said firmly, fanning himself in his chair, and\ngazing at Theodore Racksole with the direct earnest expression of a man\nhaving a grievance. 'Yes; a private detective. It's a small matter, I\nknow, and I dare say you think you've got a right, as proprietor of the\nshow, to do what you like in that line; but I've just called to tell you\nthat I object. I've called as a matter of principle. I'm not angry; it's\nthe principle of the thing.'\n\n'My dear Mr Levi,' said Racksole, 'I assure you that, having let the\nGold Room to a private individual for a private entertainment, I should\nnever dream of doing what you suggest.'\n\n'Straight?' asked Mr Sampson Levi, using his own picturesque language.\n\n'Straight,' said Racksole smiling.\n\n'There was a gent present at my ball that I didn't ask. I've got a\nwonderful memory for faces, and I know. Several fellows asked me\nafterwards what he was doing there. I was told by someone that he was\none of your waiters, but I didn't believe that. I know nothing of the\nGrand Babylon; it's not quite my style of tavern, but I don't think\nyou'd send one of your own waiters to watch my guests--unless, of\ncourse, you sent him as a waiter; and this chap didn't do any waiting,\nthough he did his share of drinking.'\n\n'Perhaps I can throw some light on this mystery,' said Racksole. 'I may\ntell you that I was already aware that man had attended your ball\nuninvited.'\n\n'How did you get to know?'\n\n'By pure chance, Mr Levi, and not by inquiry. That man was a former\nwaiter at this h\u00c3\u00b4tel--the head waiter, in fact--Jules. No doubt you have\nheard of him.'\n\n'Not I,' said Mr Levi positively.\n\n'Ah!' said Racksole, 'I was informed that everyone knew Jules, but it\nappears not. Well, be that as it may, previously to the night of your\nball, I had dismissed Jules. I had ordered him never to enter the\nBabylon again.\n\nBut on that evening I encountered him here--not in the Gold Room, but in\nthe h\u00c3\u00b4tel itself. I asked him to explain his presence, and he stated he\nwas your guest. That is all I know of the matter, Mr Levi, and I am\nextremely sorry that you should have thought me capable of the enormity\nof placing a private detective among your guests.'\n\n'This is perfectly satisfactory to me,' Mr Sampson Levi said, after a\npause.\n\n'I only wanted an explanation, and I've got it. I was told by some pals\nof mine in the City I might rely on Mr Theodore Racksole going straight\nto the point, and I'm glad they were right. Now as to that feller Jules,\nI shall make my own inquiries as to him. Might I ask you why you\ndismissed him?'\n\n'I don't know why I dismissed him.'\n\n'You don't know? Oh! come now! I'm only asking because I thought you\nmight be able to give me a hint why he turned up uninvited at my ball.\nSorry if I'm too inquisitive.'\n\n'Not at all, Mr Levi; but I really don't know. I only sort of felt that\nhe was a suspicious character. I dismissed him on instinct, as it were.\nSee?'\n\nWithout answering this question Mr Levi asked another. 'If this Jules is\nsuch a well-known person,' he said, 'how could the feller hope to come\nto my ball without being recognized?'\n\n'Give it up,' said Racksole promptly.\n\n'Well, I'll be moving on,' was Mr Sampson Levi's next remark. 'Good day,\nand thank ye. I suppose you aren't doing anything in Kaffirs?'\n\nMr Racksole smiled a negative.\n\n'I thought not,' said Levi. 'Well, I never touch American rails myself,\nand so I reckon we sha'n't come across each other. Good day.'\n\n'Good day,' said Racksole politely, following Mr Sampson Levi to the\ndoor.\n\nWith his hand on the handle of the door, Mr Levi stopped, and, gazing at\nTheodore Racksole with a shrewd, quizzical expression, remarked:\n\n'Strange things been going on here lately, eh?'\n\nThe two men looked very hard at each other for several seconds.\n\n'Yes,' Racksole assented. 'Know anything about them?'\n\n'Well--no, not exactly,' said Mr Levi. 'But I had a fancy you and I\nmight be useful to each other; I had a kind of fancy to that effect.'\n\n'Come back and sit down again, Mr Levi,' Racksole said, attracted by the\nevident straightforwardness of the man's tone. 'Now, how can we be of\nservice to each other? I flatter myself I'm something of a judge of\ncharacter, especially financial character, and I tell you--if you'll put\nyour cards on the table, I'll do ditto with mine.'\n\n'Agreed,' said Mr Sampson Levi. 'I'll begin by explaining my interest in\nyour h\u00c3\u00b4tel. I have been expecting to receive a summons from a certain\nPrince Eugen of Posen to attend him here, and that summons hasn't\narrived. It appears that Prince Eugen hasn't come to London at all. Now,\nI could have taken my dying davy that he would have been here yesterday\nat the latest.'\n\n'Why were you so sure?'\n\n'Question for question,' said Levi. 'Let's clear the ground first, Mr\nRacksole. Why did you buy this h\u00c3\u00b4tel? That's a conundrum that's been\npuzzling a lot of our fellows in the City for some days past. Why did\nyou buy the Grand Babylon? And what is the next move to be?'\n\n'There is no next move,' answered Racksole candidly, 'and I will tell\nyou why I bought the h\u00c3\u00b4tel; there need be no secret about it. I bought\nit because of a whim.' And then Theodore Racksole gave this little Jew,\nwhom he had begun to respect, a faithful account of the transaction with\nMr Felix Babylon. 'I suppose,' he added, 'you find a difficulty in\nappreciating my state of mind when I did the deal.'\n\n'Not a bit,' said Mr Levi. 'I once bought an electric launch on the\nThames in a very similar way, and it turned out to be one of the most\nsatisfactory purchases I ever made. Then it's a simple accident that you\nown this h\u00c3\u00b4tel at the present moment?'\n\n'A simple accident--all because of a beefsteak and a bottle of Bass.'\n\n'Um!' grunted Mr Sampson Levi, stroking his triple chin.\n\n'To return to Prince Eugen,' Racksole resumed. 'I was expecting His\nHighness here. The State apartments had been prepared for him. He was\ndue on the very afternoon that young Dimmock died. But he never came,\nand I have not heard why he has failed to arrive; nor have I seen his\nname in the papers. What his business was in London, I don't know.'\n\n'I will tell you,' said Mr Sampson Levi, 'he was coming to arrange a\nloan.'\n\n'A State loan?'\n\n'No--a private loan.'\n\n'Whom from?'\n\n'From me, Sampson Levi. You look surprised. If you'd lived in London a\nlittle longer, you'd know that I was just the person the Prince would\ncome to. Perhaps you aren't aware that down Throgmorton Street way I'm\ncalled \"The Court Pawnbroker\", because I arrange loans for the minor,\nsecond-class Princes of Europe. I'm a stockbroker, but my real business\nis financing some of the little Courts of Europe. Now, I may tell you\nthat the Hereditary Prince of Posen particularly wanted a million, and\nhe wanted it by a certain date, and he knew that if the affair wasn't\nfixed up by a certain time here he wouldn't be able to get it by that\ncertain date. That's why I'm surprised he isn't in London.'\n\n'What did he need a million for?'\n\n'Debts,' answered Sampson Levi laconically.\n\n'His own?'\n\n'Certainly.'\n\n'But he isn't thirty years of age?'\n\n'What of that? He isn't the only European Prince who has run up a\nmillion of debts in a dozen years. To a Prince the thing is as easy as\neating a sandwich.'\n\n'And why has he taken this sudden resolution to liquidate them?'\n\n'Because the Emperor and the lady's parents won't let him marry till he\nhas done so! And quite right, too! He's got to show a clean sheet, or\nthe Princess Anna of Eckstein-Schwartzburg will never be Princess of\nPosen. Even now the Emperor has no idea how much Prince Eugen's debts\namount to. If he had--!'\n\n'But would not the Emperor know of this proposed loan?'\n\n'Not necessarily at once. It could be so managed. Twig?' Mr Sampson Levi\nlaughed. 'I've carried these little affairs through before. After\nmarriage it might be allowed to leak out. And you know the Princess\nAnna's fortune is pretty big! Now, Mr Racksole,' he added, abruptly\nchanging his tone, 'where do you suppose Prince Eugen has disappeared\nto? Because if he doesn't turn up to-day he can't have that million. To-\nday is the last day. To-morrow the money will be appropriated,\nelsewhere. Of course, I'm not alone in this business, and my friends\nhave something to say.'\n\n'You ask me where I think Prince Eugen has disappeared to?'\n\n'I do.'\n\n'Then you think it's a disappearance?'\n\nSampson Levi nodded. 'Putting two and two together,' he said, 'I do. The\nDimmock business is very peculiar--very peculiar, indeed. Dimmock was a\nleft-handed relation of the Posen family. Twig? Scarcely anyone knows\nthat.\n\nHe was made secretary and companion to Prince Aribert, just to keep him\nin the domestic circle. His mother was an Irishwoman, whose misfortune\nwas that she was too beautiful. Twig?' (Mr Sampson Levi always used this\nextraordinary word when he was in a communicative mood.) 'My belief is\nthat Dimmock's death has something to do with the disappearance of\nPrince Eugen.\n\nThe only thing that passes me is this: Why should anyone want to make\nPrince Eugen disappear? The poor little Prince hasn't an enemy in the\nworld. If he's been \"copped\", as they say, why has he been \"copped\"? It\nwon't do anyone any good.'\n\n'Won't it?' repeated Racksole, with a sudden flash.\n\n'What do you mean?' asked Mr Levi.\n\n'I mean this: Suppose some other European pauper Prince was anxious to\nmarry Princess Anna and her fortune, wouldn't that Prince have an\ninterest in stopping this loan of yours to Prince Eugen? Wouldn't he\nhave an interest in causing Prince Eugen to disappear--at any rate, for\na time?'\n\nSampson Levi thought hard for a few moments.\n\n'Mr Theodore Racksole,' he said at length, 'I do believe you have hit on\nsomething.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twelve ROCCO AND ROOM NO. 111\n\nON the afternoon of the same day--the interview just described had\noccurred in the morning--Racksole was visited by another idea, and he\nsaid to himself that he ought to have thought of it before. The\nconversation with Mr Sampson Levi had continued for a considerable time,\nand the two men had exchanged various notions, and agreed to meet again,\nbut the theory that Reginald Dimmock had probably been a traitor to his\nfamily--a traitor whose repentance had caused his death--had not been\nthoroughly discussed; the talk had tended rather to Continental\npolitics, with a view to discovering what princely family might have an\ninterest in the temporary disappearance of Prince Eugen. Now, as\nRacksole considered in detail the particular affair of Reginald Dimmock,\ndeceased, he was struck by one point especially, to wit: Why had Dimmock\nand Jules manoeuvred to turn Nella Racksole out of Room No. 111 on that\nfirst night? That they had so manoeuvred, that the broken window-pane\nwas not a mere accident, Racksole felt perfectly sure. He had felt\nperfectly sure all along; but the significance of the facts had not\nstruck him. It was plain to him now that there must be something of\nextraordinary and peculiar importance about Room No. 111. After lunch he\nwandered quietly upstairs and looked at Room No. 111; that is to say, he\nlooked at the outside of it; it happened to be occupied, but the guest\nwas leaving that evening. The thought crossed his mind that there could\nbe no object in gazing blankly at the outside of a room; yet he gazed;\nthen he wandered quickly down again to the next floor, and in passing\nalong the corridor of that floor he stopped, and with an involuntary\ngesture stamped his foot.\n\n'Great Scott!' he said, 'I've got hold of something--No. 111 is exactly\nover the State apartments.'\n\nHe went to the bureau, and issued instructions that No. 111 was not to\nbe re-let to anyone until further orders. At the bureau they gave him\nNella's note, which ran thus:\n\nDearest Papa,--I am going away for a day or two on the trail of a clue.\n\nIf I'm not back in three days, begin to inquire for me at Ostend. Till\nthen leave me alone.--Your sagacious daughter, NELL.\n\nThese few words, in Nella's large scrawling hand, filled one side of the\npaper. At the bottom was a P.T.O. He turned over, and read the sentence,\nunderlined, 'P.S.--Keep an eye on Rocco.'\n\n'I wonder what the little creature is up to?' he murmured, as he tore\nthe letter into small fragments, and threw them into the waste-paper\nbasket.\n\nThen, without any delay, he took the lift down to the basement, with the\nobject of making a preliminary inspection of Rocco in his lair. He could\nscarcely bring himself to believe that this suave and stately gentleman,\nthis enthusiast of gastronomy, was concerned in the machinations of\nJules and other rascals unknown. Nevertheless, from habit, he obeyed his\ndaughter, giving her credit for a certain amount of perspicuity and\ncleverness.\n\nThe kitchens of the Grand Babylon H\u00c3\u00b4tel are one of the wonders of\nEurope.\n\nOnly three years before the events now under narration Felix Babylon had\nhad them newly installed with every device and patent that the ingenuity\nof two continents could supply. They covered nearly an acre of\nsuperficial space.\n\nThey were walled and floored from end to end with tiles and marble,\nwhich enabled them to be washed down every morning like the deck of a\nman-of-war.\n\nVisitors were sometimes taken to see the potato-paring machine, the\npatent plate-dryer, the Babylon-spit (a contrivance of Felix Babylon's\nown), the silver-grill, the system of connected stock-pots, and other\namazing phenomena of the department. Sometimes, if they were fortunate,\nthey might also see the artist who sculptured ice into forms of men and\nbeasts for table ornaments, or the first napkin-folder in London, or the\nman who daily invented fresh designs for pastry and blancmanges. Twelve\nchefs pursued their labours in those kitchens, helped by ninety\nassistant chefs, and a further army of unconsidered menials. Over all\nthese was Rocco, supreme and unapproachable. Half-way along the suite of\nkitchens, Rocco had an apartment of his own, wherein he thought out\nthose magnificent combinations, those marvellous feats of succulence and\noriginality, which had given him his fame. Visitors never caught a\nglimpse of Rocco in the kitchens, though sometimes, on a special night,\nhe would stroll nonchalantly through the dining-room, like the great man\nhe was, to receive the compliments of the h\u00c3\u00b4tel habitu\u00c3\u00a9s--people of\ninsight who recognized his uniqueness.\n\nTheodore Racksole's sudden and unusual appearance in the kitchen caused\na little stir. He nodded to some of the chefs, but said nothing to\nanyone, merely wandering about amid the maze of copper utensils, and\nwhite-capped workers. At length he saw Rocco, surrounded by several\nadmiring chefs. Rocco was bending over a freshly-roasted partridge which\nlay on a blue dish. He plunged a long fork into the back of the bird,\nand raised it in the air with his left hand. In his right he held a long\nglittering carving-knife. He was giving one of his world-famous\nexhibitions of carving. In four swift, unerring, delicate, perfect\nstrokes he cleanly severed the limbs of the partridge. It was a\nwonderful achievement--how wondrous none but the really skilful carver\ncan properly appreciate. The chefs emitted a hum of applause, and Rocco,\nlong, lean, and graceful, retired to his own apartment. Racksole\nfollowed him. Rocco sat in a chair, one hand over his eyes; he had not\nnoticed Theodore Racksole.\n\n'What are you doing, M. Rocco?' the millionaire asked smiling. 'Ah!'\nexclaimed Rocco, starting up with an apology. 'Pardon! I was inventing a\nnew mayonnaise, which I shall need for a certain menu next week.'\n\n'Do you invent these things without materials, then?' questioned\nRacksole.\n\n'Certainly. I do dem in my mind. I tink dem. Why should I want\nmaterials? I know all flavours. I tink, and tink, and tink, and it is\ndone. I write down.\n\nI give the recipe to my best chef--dere you are. I need not even taste,\nI know how it will taste. It is like composing music. De great composers\ndo not compose at de piano.'\n\n'I see,' said Racksole.\n\n'It is because I work like dat dat you pay me three thousand a year,'\nRocco added gravely.\n\n'Heard about Jules?' said Racksole abruptly.\n\n'Jules?'\n\n'Yes. He's been arrested in Ostend,' the millionaire continued, lying\ncleverly at a venture. 'They say that he and several others are\nimplicated in a murder case--the murder of Reginald Dimmock.'\n\n'Truly?' drawled Rocco, scarcely hiding a yawn. His indifference was so\nsuperb, so gorgeous, that Racksole instantly divined that it was assumed\nfor the occasion.\n\n'It seems that, after all, the police are good for something. But this\nis the first time I ever knew them to be worth their salt. There is to\nbe a thorough and systematic search of the h\u00c3\u00b4tel to-morrow,' Racksole\nwent on. 'I have mentioned it to you to warn you that so far as you are\nconcerned the search is of course merely a matter of form. You will not\nobject to the detectives looking through your rooms?'\n\n'Certainly not,' and Rocco shrugged his shoulders.\n\n'I shall ask you to say nothing about this to anyone,' said Racksole.\n'The news of Jules' arrest is quite private to myself. The papers know\nnothing of it. You comprehend?'\n\nRocco smiled in his grand manner, and Rocco's master thereupon went\naway.\n\nRacksole was very well satisfied with the little conversation. It was\nperhaps dangerous to tell a series of mere lies to a clever fellow like\nRocco, and Racksole wondered how he should ultimately explain them to\nthis great master-chef if his and Nella's suspicions should be\nunfounded, and nothing came of them. Nevertheless, Rocco's manner, a\nstrange elusive something in the man's eyes, had nearly convinced\nRacksole that he was somehow implicated in Jules' schemes--and probably\nin the death of Reginald Dimmock and the disappearance of Prince Eugen\nof Posen.\n\nThat night, or rather about half-past one the next morning, when the\nlast noises of the h\u00c3\u00b4tel's life had died down, Racksole made his way to\nRoom 111 on the second floor. He locked the door on the inside, and\nproceeded to examine the place, square foot by square foot. Every now\nand then some creak or other sound startled him, and he listened\nintently for a few seconds. The bedroom was furnished in the ordinary\nsplendid style of bedrooms at the Grand Babylon H\u00c3\u00b4tel, and in that\nrespect called for no remark. What most interested Racksole was the\nflooring. He pulled up the thick Oriental carpet, and peered along every\nplank, but could discover nothing unusual.\n\nThen he went to the dressing-room, and finally to the bathroom, both of\nwhich opened out of the main room. But in neither of these smaller\nchambers was he any more successful than in the bedroom itself. Finally\nhe came to the bath, which was enclosed in a panelled casing of polished\nwood, after the manner of baths. Some baths have a cupboard beneath the\ntaps, with a door at the side, but this one appeared to have none. He\ntapped the panels, but not a single one of them gave forth that 'curious\nhollow sound' which usually betokens a secret place. Idly he turned the\ncold-tap of the bath, and the water began to rush in. He turned off the\ncold-tap and turned on the waste-tap, and as he did so his knee, which\nwas pressing against the panelling, slipped forward. The panelling had\ngiven way, and he saw that one large panel was hinged from the inside,\nand caught with a hasp, also on the inside. A large space within the\ncasing of the end of the bath was thus revealed. Before doing anything\nelse, Racksole tried to repeat the trick with the waste-tap, but he\nfailed; it would not work again, nor could he in any way perceive that\nthere was any connection between the rod of the waste-tap and the hasp\nof the panel. Racksole could not see into the cavity within the casing,\nand the electric light was fixed, and could not be moved about like a\ncandle. He felt in his pockets, and fortunately discovered a box of\nmatches. Aided by these, he looked into the cavity, and saw nothing;\nnothing except a rather large hole at the far end--some three feet from\nthe casing. With some difficulty he squeezed himself through the open\npanel, and took a half-kneeling, half-sitting posture within. There he\nstruck a match, and it was a most unfortunate thing that in striking,\nthe box being half open, he set fire to all the matches, and was half\nsmothered in the atrocious stink of phosphorus which resulted. One match\nburned clear on the floor of the cavity, and, rubbing his eyes, Racksole\npicked it up, and looked down the hole which he had previously descried.\nIt was a hole apparently bottomless, and about eighteen inches square.\nThe curious part about the hole was that a rope-ladder hung down it.\nWhen he saw that rope-ladder Racksole smiled the smile of a happy man.\n\nThe match went out.\n\nShould he make a long journey, perhaps to some distant corner of the\nh\u00c3\u00b4tel, for a fresh box of matches, or should he attempt to descend that\nrope-ladder in the dark? He decided on the latter course, and he was the\nmore strongly moved thereto as he could now distinguish a faint, a very\nfaint tinge of light at the bottom of the hole.\n\nWith infinite care he compressed himself into the well-like hole, and\ndescended the latter. At length he arrived on firm ground, perspiring,\nbut quite safe and quite excited. He saw now that the tinge of light\ncame through a small hole in the wood. He put his eye to the wood, and\nfound that he had a fine view of the State bathroom, and through the\ndoor of the State bathroom into the State bedroom. At the massive\nmarble-topped washstand in the State bedroom a man was visible, bending\nover some object which lay thereon.\n\nThe man was Rocco!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Thirteen IN THE STATE BEDROOM\n\nIT was of course plain to Racksole that the peculiar passageway which he\nhad, at great personal inconvenience, discovered between the bathroom of\nNo. 111 and the State bathroom on the floor below must have been\nspecially designed by some person or persons for the purpose of keeping\na nefarious watch upon the occupants of the State suite of apartments.\nIt was a means of communication at once simple and ingenious. At that\nmoment he could not be sure of the precise method employed for it, but\nhe surmised that the casing of the waterpipes had been used as a 'well',\nwhile space for the pipes themselves had been found in the thickness of\nthe ample brick walls of the Grand Babylon. The eye-hole, through which\nhe now had a view of the bedroom, was a very minute one, and probably\nwould scarcely be noticed from the exterior. One thing he observed\nconcerning it, namely, that it had been made for a man somewhat taller\nthan himself; he was obliged to stand on tiptoe in order to get his eye\nin the correct position. He remembered that both Jules and Rocco were\ndistinctly above the average height; also that they were both thin men,\nand could have descended the well with comparative ease. Theodore\nRacksole, though not stout, was a well-set man with large bones.\n\nThese things flashed through his mind as he gazed, spellbound, at the\nmysterious movements of Rocco. The door between the bathroom and the\nbedroom was wide open, and his own situation was such that his view\nembraced a considerable portion of the bedroom, including the whole of\nthe immense and gorgeously-upholstered bedstead, but not including the\nwhole of the marble washstand. He could see only half of the washstand,\nand at intervals Rocco passed out of sight as his lithe hands moved over\nthe object which lay on the marble. At first Theodore Racksole could not\ndecide what this object was, but after a time, as his eyes grew\naccustomed to the position and the light, he made it out.\n\nIt was the body of a man. Or, rather, to be more exact, Racksole could\ndiscern the legs of a man on that half of the table which was visible to\nhim. Involuntarily he shuddered, as the conviction forced itself upon\nhim that Rocco had some unconscious human being helpless on that cold\nmarble surface. The legs never moved. Therefore, the hapless creature\nwas either asleep or under the influence of an anaesthetic--or (horrible\nthought!) dead.\n\nRacksole wanted to call out, to stop by some means or other the dreadful\nmidnight activity which was proceeding before his astonished eyes; but\nfortunately he restrained himself.\n\nOn the washstand he could see certain strangely-shaped utensils and\ninstruments which Rocco used from time to time. The work seemed to\nRacksole to continue for interminable hours, and then at last Rocco\nceased, gave a sign of satisfaction, whistled several bars from\n'Cavalleria Rusticana', and came into the bath-room, where he took off\nhis coat, and very quietly washed his hands. As he stood calmly and\nleisurely wiping those long fingers of his, he was less than four feet\nfrom Racksole, and the cooped-up millionaire trembled, holding his\nbreath, lest Rocco should detect his presence behind the woodwork. But\nnothing happened, and Rocco returned unsuspectingly to the bedroom.\nRacksole saw him place some sort of white flannel garment over the prone\nform on the table, and then lift it bodily on to the great bed, where it\nlay awfully still. The hidden watcher was sure now that it was a corpse\nupon which Rocco had been exercising his mysterious and sinister\nfunctions.\n\nBut whose corpse? And what functions? Could this be a West End h\u00c3\u00b4tel,\nRacksole's own h\u00c3\u00b4tel, in the very heart of London, the best-policed city\nin the world? It seemed incredible, impossible; yet so it was. Once more\nhe remembered what Felix Babylon had said to him and realized the truth\nof the saying anew. The proprietor of a vast and complicated\nestablishment like the Grand Babylon could never know a tithe of the\nextraordinary and queer occurrences which happened daily under his very\nnose; the atmosphere of such a caravanserai must necessarily be an\natmosphere of mystery and problems apparently inexplicable.\nNevertheless, Racksole thought that Fate was carrying things with rather\na high hand when she permitted his chef to spend the night hours over a\nman's corpse in his State bedroom, this sacred apartment which was\nsupposed to be occupied only by individuals of Royal Blood. Racksole\nwould not have objected to a certain amount of mystery, but he decidedly\nthought that there was a little too much mystery here for his taste. He\nthought that even Felix Babylon would have been surprised at this.\n\nThe electric chandelier in the centre of the ceiling was not lighted;\nonly the two lights on either side of the washstand were switched on,\nand these did not sufficiently illuminate the features of the man on the\nbed to enable Racksole to see them clearly. In vain the millionaire\nstrained his eyes; he could only make out that the corpse was probably\nthat of a young man. Just as he was wondering what would be the best\ncourse of action to pursue, he saw Rocco with a square-shaped black box\nin his hand. Then the chef switched off the two electric lights, and the\nState bedroom was in darkness. In that swift darkness Racksole heard\nRocco spring on to the bed. Another half-dozen moments of suspense, and\nthere was a blinding flash of white, which endured for several seconds,\nand showed Rocco standing like an evil spirit over the corpse, the black\nbox in one hand and a burning piece of aluminium wire in the other. The\naluminium wire burnt out, and darkness followed blacker than before.\n\nRocco had photographed the corpse by flashlight.\n\nBut the dazzling flare which had disclosed the features of the dead man\nto the insensible lens of the camera had disclosed them also to Theodore\nRacksole. The dead man was Reginald Dimmock!\n\nStung into action by this discovery, Racksole tried to find the exit\nfrom his place of concealment. He felt sure that there existed some way\nout into the State bathroom, but he sought for it fruitlessly, groping\nwith both hands and feet. Then he decided that he must ascend the rope-\nladder, make haste for the first-floor corridor, and intercept Rocco\nwhen he left the State apartments. It was a painful and difficult\nbusiness to ascend that thin and yielding ladder in such a confined\nspace, but Racksole was managing it very nicely, and had nearly reached\nthe top, when, by some untoward freak of chance, the ladder broke above\nhis weight, and he slipped ignominiously down to the bottom of the\nwooden tube. Smothering an excusable curse, Racksole crouched, baffled.\nThen he saw that the force of his fall had somehow opened a trap-door at\nhis feet. He squeezed through, pushed open another tiny door, and in\nanother second stood in the State bathroom. He was dishevelled,\nperspiring, rather bewildered; but he was there. In the next second he\nhad resumed absolute command of all his faculties.\n\nStrange to say, he had moved so quietly that Rocco had apparently not\nheard him. He stepped noiselessly to the door between the bathroom and\nthe bedroom, and stood there in silence. Rocco had switched on again the\nlights over the washstand and was busy with his utensils.\n\nRacksole deliberately coughed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Fourteen ROCCO ANSWERS SOME QUESTIONS\n\nROCCO turned round with the swiftness of a startled tiger, and gave\nTheodore Racksole one long piercing glance.\n\n'D--n!' said Rocco, with as pure an Anglo-Saxon accent and intonation as\nRacksole himself could have accomplished.\n\nThe most extraordinary thing about the situation was that at this\njuncture Theodore Racksole did not know what to say. He was so\ndumbfounded by the affair, and especially by Rocco's absolute and\nsublime calm, that both speech and thought failed him.\n\n'I give in,' said Rocco. 'From the moment you entered this cursed h\u00c3\u00b4tel\nI was afraid of you. I told Jules I was afraid of you. I knew there\nwould be trouble with a man of your kidney, and I was right; confound\nit! I tell you I give in. I know when I'm beaten. I've got no revolver\nand no weapons of any kind. I surrender. Do what you like.'\n\nAnd with that Rocco sat down on a chair. It was magnificently done. Only\na truly great man could have done it. Rocco actually kept his dignity.\n\nFor answer, Racksole walked slowly into the vast apartment, seized a\nchair, and, dragging it up to Rocco's chair, sat down opposite to him.\nThus they faced each other, their knees almost touching, both in evening\ndress. On Rocco's right hand was the bed, with the corpse of Reginald\nDimmock. On Racksole's right hand, and a little behind him, was the\nmarble washstand, still littered with Rocco's implements. The electric\nlight shone on Rocco's left cheek, leaving the other side of his face in\nshadow. Racksole tapped him on the knee twice.\n\n'So you're another Englishman masquerading as a foreigner in my h\u00c3\u00b4tel,'\n\nRacksole remarked, by way of commencing the interrogation.\n\n'I'm not,' answered Rocco quietly. 'I'm a citizen of the United States.'\n\n'The deuce you are!' Racksole exclaimed.\n\n'Yes, I was born at West Orange, New Jersey, New York State. I call\nmyself an Italian because it was in Italy that I first made a name as a\nchef--at Rome. It is better for a great chef like me to be a foreigner.\nImagine a great chef named Elihu P. Rucker. You can't imagine it. I\nchanged my nationality for the same reason that my friend and colleague,\nJules, otherwise Mr Jackson, changed his.'\n\n'So Jules is your friend and colleague, is he?'\n\n'He was, but from this moment he is no longer. I began to disapprove of\nhis methods no less than a week ago, and my disapproval will now take\nactive form.'\n\n'Will it?' said Racksole. 'I calculate it just won't, Mr Elihu P.\nRucker, citizen of the United States. Before you are very much older\nyou'll be in the kind hands of the police, and your activities, in no\nmatter what direction, will come to an abrupt conclusion.'\n\n'It is possible,' sighed Rocco.\n\n'In the meantime, I'll ask you one or two questions for my own private\nsatisfaction. You've acknowledged that the game is up, and you may as\nwell answer them with as much candour as you feel yourself capable of.\nSee?'\n\n'I see,' replied Rocco calmly, 'but I guess I can't answer all\nquestions.\n\nI'll do what I can.'\n\n'Well,' said Racksole, clearing his throat, 'what's the scheme all\nabout? Tell me in a word.'\n\n'Not in a thousand words. It isn't my secret, you know.'\n\n'Why was poor little Dimmock poisoned?' The millionaire's voice softened\nas he looked for an instant at the corpse of the unfortunate young man.\n\n'I don't know,' said Rocco. 'I don't mind informing you that I objected\nto that part of the business. I wasn't made aware of it till after it\nwas done, and then I tell you it got my dander up considerable.'\n\n'You mean to say you don't know why Dimmock was done to death?'\n\n'I mean to say I couldn't see the sense of it. Of course he--er--died,\nbecause he sort of cried off the scheme, having previously taken a share\nof it. I don't mind saying that much, because you probably guessed it\nfor yourself. But I solemnly state that I have a conscientious objection\nto murder.'\n\n'Then it was murder?'\n\n'It was a kind of murder,' Rocco admitted. 'Who did it?'\n\n'Unfair question,' said Rocco.\n\n'Who else is in this precious scheme besides Jules and yourself?'\n\n'Don't know, on my honour.'\n\n'Well, then, tell me this. What have you been doing to Dimmock's body?'\n\n'How long were you in that bathroom?' Rocco parried with sublime\nimpudence.\n\n'Don't question me, Mr Rucker,' said Theodore Racksole. 'I feel very\nmuch inclined to break your back across my knee. Therefore I advise you\nnot to irritate me. What have you been doing to Dimmock's body?'\n\n'I've been embalming it.'\n\n'Em--balming it.'\n\n'Certainly; Richardson's system of arterial fluid injection, as improved\nby myself. You weren't aware that I included the art of embalming among\nmy accomplishments. Nevertheless, it is so.'\n\n'But why?' asked Racksole, more mystified than ever. 'Why should you\ntrouble to embalm the poor chap's corpse?'\n\n'Can't you see? Doesn't it strike you? That corpse has to be taken care\nof.\n\nIt contains, or rather, it did contain, very serious evidence against\nsome person or persons unknown to the police. It may be necessary to\nmove it about from place to place. A corpse can't be hidden for long; a\ncorpse betrays itself. One couldn't throw it in the Thames, for it would\nhave been found inside twelve hours. One couldn't bury it--it wasn't\nsafe. The only thing was to keep it handy and movable, ready for\nemergencies. I needn't inform you that, without embalming, you can't\nkeep a corpse handy and movable for more than four or five days. It's\nthe kind of thing that won't keep. And so it was suggested that I should\nembalm it, and I did. Mind you, I still objected to the murder, but I\ncouldn't go back on a colleague, you understand. You do understand that,\ndon't you? Well, here you are, and here it is, and that's all.'\n\nRocco leaned back in his chair as though he had said everything that\nought to be said. He closed his eyes to indicate that so far as he was\nconcerned the conversation was also closed. Theodore Racksole stood up.\n\n'I hope,' said Rocco, suddenly opening his eyes, 'I hope you'll call in\nthe police without any delay. It's getting late, and I don't like going\nwithout my night's rest.'\n\n'Where do you suppose you'll get a night's rest?' Racksole asked.\n\n'In the cells, of course. Haven't I told you I know when I'm beaten. I'm\nnot so blind as not to be able to see that there's at any rate a prima\nfacie case against me. I expect I shall get off with a year or two's\nimprisonment as accessory after the fact--I think that's what they call\nit. Anyhow, I shall be in a position to prove that I am not implicated\nin the murder of this unfortunate nincompoop.' He pointed, with a\nstrange, scornful gesture of his elbow, to the bed. 'And now, shall we\ngo? Everyone is asleep, but there will be a policeman within call of the\nwatchman in the portico. I am at your service. Let us go down together,\nMr Racksole. I give you my word to go quietly.'\n\n'Stay a moment,' said Theodore Racksole curtly; 'there is no hurry. It\nwon't do you any harm to forego another hour's sleep, especially as you\nwill have no work to do to-morrow. I have one or two more questions to\nput to you.'\n\n'Well?' Rocco murmured, with an air of tired resignation, as if to say,\n'What must be must be.'\n\n'Where has Dimmock's corpse been during the last three or four days,\nsince he--died?'\n\n'Oh!' answered Rocco, apparently surprised at the simplicity of the\nquestion. 'It's been in my room, and one night it was on the roof; once\nit went out of the h\u00c3\u00b4tel as luggage, but it came back the next day as a\ncase of Demerara sugar. I forget where else it has been, but it's been\nkept perfectly safe and treated with every consideration.'\n\n'And who contrived all these manoeuvres?' asked Racksole as calmly as he\ncould.\n\n'I did. That is to say, I invented them and I saw that they were carried\nout. You see, the suspicions of your police obliged me to be\nparticularly spry.'\n\n'And who carried them out?'\n\n'Ah! that would be telling tales. But I don't mind assuring you that my\naccomplices were innocent accomplices. It is absurdly easy for a man\nlike me to impose on underlings--absurdly easy.'\n\n'What did you intend to do with the corpse ultimately?' Racksole pursued\nhis inquiry with immovable countenance.\n\n'Who knows?' said Rocco, twisting his beautiful moustache. 'That would\nhave depended on several things--on your police, for instance. But\nprobably in the end we should have restored this mortal clay'--again he\njerked his elbow--'to the man's sorrowing relatives.'\n\n'Do you know who the relatives are?'\n\n'Certainly. Don't you? If you don't I need only hint that Dimmock had a\nPrince for his father.'\n\n'It seems to me,' said Racksole, with cold sarcasm, 'that you behaved\nrather clumsily in choosing this bedroom as the scene of your\noperations.'\n\n'Not at all,' said Rocco. 'There was no other apartment so suitable in\nthe whole h\u00c3\u00b4tel. Who would have guessed that anything was going on here?\nIt was the very place for me.'\n\n'I guessed,' said Racksole succinctly.\n\n'Yes, you guessed, Mr Racksole. But I had not counted on you. You are\nthe only smart man in the business. You are an American citizen, and I\nhadn't reckoned to have to deal with that class of person.'\n\n'Apparently I frightened you this afternoon?'\n\n'Not in the least.'\n\n'You were not afraid of a search?'\n\n'I knew that no search was intended. I knew that you were trying to\nfrighten me. You must really credit me with a little sagacity and\ninsight, Mr Racksole. Immediately you began to talk to me in the kitchen\nthis afternoon I felt you were on the track. But I was not frightened. I\nmerely decided that there was no time to be lost--that I must act\nquickly. I did act quickly, but, it seems, not quickly enough. I grant\nthat your rapidity exceeded mine. Let us go downstairs, I beg.'\n\nRocco rose and moved towards the door. With an instinctive action\nRacksole rushed forward and seized him by the shoulder.\n\n'No tricks!' said Racksole. 'You're in my custody and don't forget it.'\n\nRocco turned on his employer a look of gentle, dignified scorn. 'Have I\nnot informed you,' he said, 'that I have the intention of going\nquietly?'\n\nRacksole felt almost ashamed for the moment. It flashed across him that\na man can be great, even in crime.\n\n'What an ineffable fool you were,' said Racksole, stopping him at the\nthreshold, 'with your talents, your unique talents, to get yourself\nmixed up in an affair of this kind. You are ruined. And, by Jove! you\nwere a great man in your own line.'\n\n'Mr Racksole,' said Rocco very quickly, 'that is the truest word you\nhave spoken this night. I was a great man in my own line. And I am an\nineffable fool. Alas!' He brought his long arms to his sides with a\nthud.\n\n'Why did you do it?'\n\n'I was fascinated--fascinated by Jules. He, too, is a great man. We had\ngreat opportunities, here in the Grand Babylon. It was a great game. It\nwas worth the candle. The prizes were enormous. You would admit these\nthings if you knew the facts. Perhaps some day you will know them, for\nyou are a fairly clever person at getting to the root of a matter. Yes,\nI was blinded, hypnotized.'\n\n'And now you are ruined.'\n\n'Not ruined, not ruined. Afterwards, in a few years, I shall come up\nagain.\n\nA man of genius like me is never ruined till he is dead. Genius is\nalways forgiven. I shall be forgiven. Suppose I am sent to prison. When\nI emerge I shall be no gaol-bird. I shall be Rocco--the great Rocco. And\nhalf the h\u00c3\u00b4tels in Europe will invite me to join them.'\n\n'Let me tell you, as man to man, that you have achieved your own\ndegradation. There is no excuse.'\n\n'I know it,' said Rocco. 'Let us go.'\n\nRacksole was distinctly and notably impressed by this man--by this\nmaster spirit to whom he was to have paid a salary at the rate of three\nthousand pounds a year. He even felt sorry for him. And so, side by\nside, the captor and the captured, they passed into the vast deserted\ncorridor of the h\u00c3\u00b4tel.\n\nRocco stopped at the grating of the first lift.\n\n'It will be locked,' said Racksole. 'We must use the stairs to-night.'\n\n'But I have a key. I always carry one,' said Rocco, and he pulled one\nout of his pocket, and, unfastening the iron screen, pushed it open.\nRacksole smiled at his readiness and aplomb.\n\n'After you,' said Rocco, bowing in his finest manner, and Racksole\nstepped into the lift.\n\nWith the swiftness of lighting Rocco pushed forward the iron screen,\nwhich locked itself automatically. Theodore Racksole was hopelessly a\nprisoner within the lift, while Rocco stood free in the corridor.\n\n'Good-bye, Mr Racksole,' he remarked suavely, bowing again, lower than\nbefore. 'Good-bye: I hate to take a mean advantage of you in this\nfashion, but really you must allow that you have been very simple. You\nare a clever man, as I have already said, up to a certain point. It is\npast that point that my own cleverness comes in. Again, good-bye. After\nall, I shall have no rest to-night, but perhaps even that will be better\nthat sleeping in a police cell. If you make a great noise you may wake\nsomeone and ultimately get released from this lift. But I advise you to\ncompose yourself, and wait till morning. It will be more dignified. For\nthe third time, good-bye.'\n\nAnd with that Rocco, without hastening, walked down the corridor and so\nout of sight.\n\nRacksole said never a word. He was too disgusted with himself to speak.\nHe clenched his fists, and put his teeth together, and held his breath.\nIn the silence he could hear the dwindling sound of Rocco's footsteps on\nthe thick carpet.\n\nIt was the greatest blow of Racksole's life.\n\nThe next morning the high-born guests of the Grand Babylon were aroused\nby a rumour that by some accident the millionaire proprietor of the\nh\u00c3\u00b4tel had remained all night locked up in the lift. It was also stated\nthat Rocco had quarrelled with his new master and incontinently left the\nplace. A duchess said that Rocco's departure would mean the ruin of the\nh\u00c3\u00b4tel, whereupon her husband advised her not to talk nonsense.\n\nAs for Racksole, he sent a message for the detective in charge of the\nDimmock affair, and bravely told him the happenings of the previous\nnight.\n\nThe narration was a decided ordeal to a man of Racksole's temperament.\n\n'A strange story!' commented Detective Marshall, and he could not avoid\na smile. 'The climax was unfortunate, but you have certainly got some\nvaluable facts.'\n\nRacksole said nothing.\n\n'I myself have a clue,' added the detective. 'When your message arrived\nI was just coming up to see you. I want you to accompany me to a certain\nspot not far from here. Will you come, now, at once?'\n\n'With pleasure,' said Racksole.\n\nAt that moment a page entered with a telegram. Racksole opened it read:\n\n'Please come instantly. Nella. H\u00c3\u00b4tel Wellington, Ostend.'\n\nHe looked at his watch.\n\n'I can't come,' he said to the detective. I'm going to Ostend.'\n\n'To Ostend?'\n\n'Yes, now.'\n\n'But really, Mr Racksole,' protested the detective. 'My business is\nurgent.'\n\n'So's mine,' said Racksole.\n\nIn ten minutes he was on his way to Victoria Station.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Fifteen END OF THE YACHT ADVENTURE\n\nWE must now return to Nella Racksole and Prince Aribert of Posen on\nboard the yacht without a name. The Prince's first business was to make\nJules, otherwise Mr Tom Jackson, perfectly secure by means of several\npieces of rope. Although Mr Jackson had been stunned into a complete\nunconsciousness, and there was a contused wound under his ear, no one\ncould say how soon he might not come to himself and get very violent. So\nthe Prince, having tied his arms and legs, made him fast to a stanchion.\n\n'I hope he won't die,' said Nella. 'He looks very white.'\n\n'The Mr Jacksons of this world,' said Prince Aribert sententiously,\n'never die till they are hung. By the way, I wonder how it is that no\none has interfered with us. Perhaps they are discreetly afraid of my\nrevolver--of your revolver, I mean.'\n\nBoth he and Nella glanced up at the imperturbable steersman, who kept\nthe yacht's head straight out to sea. By this time they were about a\ncouple of miles from the Belgian shore.\n\nAddressing him in French, the Prince ordered the sailor to put the yacht\nabout, and make again for Ostend Harbour, but the fellow took no notice\nwhatever of the summons. The Prince raised the revolver, with the idea\nof frightening the steersman, and then the man began to talk rapidly in\na mixture of French and Flemish. He said that he had received Jules'\nstrict orders not to interfere in any way, no matter what might happen\non the deck of the yacht. He was the captain of the yacht, and he had to\nmake for a certain English port, the name of which he could not divulge:\nhe was to keep the vessel at full steam ahead under any and all\ncircumstances. He seemed to be a very big, a very strong, and a very\ndetermined man, and the Prince was at a loss what course of action to\npursue. He asked several more questions, but the only effect of them was\nto render the man taciturn and ill-humoured.\n\nIn vain Prince Aribert explained that Miss Nella Racksole, daughter of\nmillionaire Racksole, had been abducted by Mr Tom Jackson; in vain he\nflourished the revolver threateningly; the surly but courageous captain\nsaid merely that that had nothing to do with him; he had instructions,\nand he should carry them out. He sarcastically begged to remind his\ninterlocutor that he was the captain of the yacht.\n\n'It won't do to shoot him, I suppose,' said the Prince to Nella. 'I\nmight bore a hole into his leg, or something of that kind.'\n\n'It's rather risky, and rather hard on the poor captain, with his\nextraordinary sense of duty,' said Nella. 'And, besides, the whole crew\nmight turn on us. No, we must think of something else.'\n\n'I wonder where the crew is,' said the Prince.\n\nJust then Mr Jackson, prone and bound on the deck, showed signs of\nrecovering from his swoon. His eyes opened, and he gazed vacantly\naround. At length he caught sight of the Prince, who approached him with\nthe revolver well in view.\n\n'It's you, is it?' he murmured faintly. 'What are you doing on board?\nWho's tied me up like this?'\n\n'See here!' replied the Prince, 'I don't want to have any arguments, but\nthis yacht must return to Ostend at once, where you will be given up to\nthe authorities.'\n\n'Really!' snarled Mr Tom Jackson. 'Shall I!' Then he called out in\nFrench to the man at the wheel, 'Hi Andr\u00c3\u00a9! let these two be put off in\nthe dinghy.'\n\nIt was a peculiar situation. Certain of nothing but the possession of\nNella's revolver, the Prince scarcely knew whether to carry the argument\nfurther, and with stronger measures, or to accept the situation with as\nmuch dignity as the circumstances would permit.\n\n'Let us take the dinghy,' said Nella; 'we can row ashore in an hour.'\n\nHe felt that she was right. To leave the yacht in such a manner seemed\nsomewhat ignominious, and it certainly involved the escape of that\nprofound villain, Mr Thomas Jackson. But what else could be done? The\nPrince and Nella constituted one party on the vessel; they knew their\nown strength, but they did not know the strength of their opponents.\nThey held the hostile ringleader bound and captive, but this man had\nproved himself capable of giving orders, and even to gag him would not\nhelp them if the captain of the yacht persisted in his obstinate course.\nMoreover, there was a distinct objection to promiscuous shooting. The\nPrince felt that there was no knowing how promiscuous shooting might\nend.\n\n'We will take the dinghy,' said the Prince quickly, to the captain.\n\nA bell rang below, and a sailor and the Negro boy appeared on deck. The\npulsations of the screw grew less rapid. The yacht stopped. The dinghy\nwas lowered. As the Prince and Nella prepared to descend into the little\ncock-boat Mr Tom Jackson addressed Nella, all bound as he lay.\n\n'Good-bye,' he said, 'I shall see you again, never fear.'.\n\nIn another moment they were in the dinghy, and the dinghy was adrift.\nThe yacht's screw churned the water, and the beautiful vessel slipped\naway from them. As it receded a figure appeared at the stem. It was Mr\nThomas Jackson.\n\nHe had been released by his minions. He held a white handkerchief to his\near, and offered a calm, enigmatic smile to the two forlorn but\nvictorious occupants of the dinghy. Jules had been defeated for once in\nhis life; or perhaps it would be more just to say that he had been out-\nmanoeuvred. Men like Jules are incapable of being defeated. It was\ncharacteristic of his luck that now, in the very hour when he had been\ncaught red-handed in a serious crime against society, he should be\neffecting a leisurely escape--an escape which left no clue behind.\n\nThe sea was utterly calm and blue in the morning sun. The dinghy rocked\nitself lazily in the swell of the yacht's departure. As the mist cleared\naway the outline of the shore became more distinct, and it appeared as\nif Ostend was distant scarcely a cable's length. The white dome of the\ngreat Kursaal glittered in the pale turquoise sky, and the smoke of\nsteamers in the harbour could be plainly distinguished. On the offing\nwas a crowd of brown-sailed fishing luggers returning with the night's\ncatch. The many-hued bathing-vans could be counted on the distant beach.\nEverything seemed perfectly normal. It was difficult for either Nella or\nher companion to realize that anything extraordinary had happened within\nthe last hour. Yet there was the yacht, not a mile off, to prove to them\nthat something very extraordinary had, in fact, happened. The yacht was\nno vision, nor was that sinister watching figure at its stern a vision,\neither.\n\n'I suppose Jules was too surprised and too feeble to inquire how I came\nto be on board his yacht,' said the Prince, taking the oars.\n\n'Oh! How did you?' asked Nella, her face lighting up. 'Really, I had\nalmost forgotten that part of the affair.'\n\n'I must begin at the beginning and it will take some time,' answered the\nPrince. 'Had we not better postpone the recital till we get ashore?'\n\n'I will row and you shall talk,' said Nella. 'I want to know now.'\n\nHe smiled happily at her, but gently declined to yield up the oars.\n\n'Is it not sufficient that I am here?' he said.\n\n'It is sufficient, yes,' she replied, 'but I want to know.'\n\nWith a long, easy stroke he was pulling the dinghy shorewards. She sat\nin the stern-sheets.\n\n'There is no rudder,' he remarked, 'so you must direct me. Keep the\nboat's head on the lighthouse. The tide seems to be running in strongly;\nthat will help us. The people on shore will think that we have only been\nfor a little early morning excursion.'\n\n'Will you kindly tell me how it came about that you were able to save my\nlife, Prince?' she said.\n\n'Save your life, Miss Racksole? I didn't save your life; I merely\nknocked a man down.'\n\n'You saved my life,' she repeated. 'That villain would have stopped at\nnothing. I saw it in his eye.'\n\n'Then you were a brave woman, for you showed no fear of death.' His\nadmiring gaze rested full on her. For a moment the oars ceased to move.\n\nShe gave a gesture of impatience.\n\n'It happened that I saw you last night in your carriage,' he said. 'The\nfact is, I had not had the audacity to go to Berlin with my story. I\nstopped in Ostend to see whether I could do a little detective work on\nmy own account.\n\nIt was a piece of good luck that I saw you. I followed the carriage as\nquickly as I could, and I just caught a glimpse of you as you entered\nthat awful house. I knew that Jules had something to do with that house.\nI guessed what you were doing. I was afraid for you. Fortunately I had\nsurveyed the house pretty thoroughly. There is an entrance to it at the\nback, from a narrow lane. I made my way there. I got into the yard at\nthe back, and I stood under the window of the room where you had the\ninterview with Miss Spencer. I heard everything that was said. It was a\ncourageous enterprise on your part to follow Miss Spencer from the Grand\nBabylon to Ostend. Well, I dared not force an entrance, lest I might\nprecipitate matters too suddenly, and involve both of us in a\ndifficulty. I merely kept watch. Ah, Miss Racksole! you were magnificent\nwith Miss Spencer; as I say, I could hear every word, for the window was\nslightly open. I felt that you needed no assistance from me. And then\nshe cheated you with a trick, and the revolver came flying through the\nwindow. I picked it up, I thought it would probably be useful. There was\na silence. I did not guess at first that you had fainted. I thought that\nyou had escaped. When I found out the truth it was too late for me to\nintervene. There were two men, both desperate, besides Miss Spencer--'\n\n'Who was the other man?' asked Nella.\n\n'I do not know. It was dark. They drove away with you to the harbour.\nAgain I followed. I saw them carry you on board. Before the yacht\nweighed anchor I managed to climb unobserved into the dinghy. I lay down\nfull length in it, and no one suspected that I was there. I think you\nknow the rest.'\n\n'Was the yacht all ready for sea?'\n\n'The yacht was all ready for sea. The captain fellow was on the bridge,\nand steam was up.'\n\n'Then they expected me! How could that be?'\n\n'They expected some one. I do not think they expected you.'\n\n'Did the second man go on board?'\n\n'He helped to carry you along the gangway, but he came back again to the\ncarriage. He was the driver.'\n\n'And no one else saw the business?'\n\n'The quay was deserted. You see, the last steamer had arrived for the\nnight.'\n\nThere was a brief silence, and then Nella ejaculated, under her breath.\n\n'Truly, it is a wonderful world!'\n\nAnd it was a wonderful world for them, though scarcely perhaps, in the\nsense which Nella Racksole had intended. They had just emerged from a\nhighly disconcerting experience. Among other minor inconveniences, they\nhad had no breakfast. They were out in the sea in a tiny boat. Neither\nof them knew what the day might bring forth. The man, at least, had the\nmost serious anxieties for the safety of his Royal nephew. And yet--and\nyet--neither of them wished that that voyage of the little boat on the\nsummer tide should come to an end. Each, perhaps unconsciously, had a\nvague desire that it might last for ever, he lazily pulling, she\ndirecting his course at intervals by a movement of her distractingly\npretty head. How was this condition of affairs to be explained? Well,\nthey were both young; they both had superb health, and all the ardour of\nyouth; and--they were together.\n\nThe boat was very small indeed; her face was scarcely a yard from his.\nShe, in his eyes, surrounded by the glamour of beauty and vast wealth;\nhe, in her eyes, surrounded by the glamour of masculine intrepidity and\nthe brilliance of a throne.\n\nBut all voyages come to an end, either at the shore or at the bottom of\nthe sea, and at length the dinghy passed between the stone jetties of\nthe harbour. The Prince rowed to the nearest steps, tied up the boat,\nand they landed. It was six o'clock in the morning, and a day of\ngorgeous sunlight had opened. Few people were about at that early hour.\n\n'And now, what next?' said the Prince. 'I must take you to an h\u00c3\u00b4tel.'\n\n'I am in your hands,' she acquiesced, with a smile which sent the blood\nracing through his veins. He perceived now that she was tired and\novercome, suffering from a sudden and natural reaction.\n\nAt the H\u00c3\u00b4tel Wellington the Prince told the sleepy door-keeper that they\nhad come by the early train from Bruges, and wanted breakfast at once.\nIt was absurdly early, but a common English sovereign will work wonders\nin any Belgian h\u00c3\u00b4tel, and in a very brief time Nella and the Prince were\nbreakfasting on the verandah of the h\u00c3\u00b4tel upon chocolate that had been\nspecially and hastily brewed for them.\n\n'I never tasted such excellent chocolate,' claimed the Prince.\n\nThe statement was wildly untrue, for the H\u00c3\u00b4tel Wellington is not\ncelebrated for its chocolate. Nevertheless Nella replied\nenthusiastically, 'Nor I.'\n\nThen there was a silence, and Nella, feeling possibly that she had been\ntoo ecstatic, remarked in a very matter-of-fact tone: 'I must telegraph\nto Papa instantly.'\n\nThus it was that Theodore Racksole received the telegram which drew him\naway from Detective Marshall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Sixteen THE WOMAN WITH THE RED HAT\n\n'THERE is one thing, Prince, that we have just got to settle straight\noff,' said Theodore Racksole.\n\nThey were all three seated--Racksole, his daughter, and Prince Aribert--\nround a dinner table in a private room at the H\u00c3\u00b4tel Wellington. Racksole\nhad duly arrived by the afternoon boat, and had been met on the quay by\nthe other two. They had dined early, and Racksole had heard the full\nstory of the adventures by sea and land of Nella and the Prince. As to\nhis own adventure of the previous night he said very little, merely\nexplaining, with as little detail as possible, that Dimmock's body had\ncome to light.\n\n'What is that?' asked the Prince, in answer to Racksole's remark.\n\n'We have got to settle whether we shall tell the police at once all that\nhas occurred, or whether we shall proceed on our own responsibility.\nThere can be no doubt as to which course we ought to pursue. Every\nconsideration of prudence points to the advisability of taking the\npolice into our confidence, and leaving the matter entirely in their\nhands.'\n\n'Oh, Papa!' Nella burst out in her pouting, impulsive way. 'You surely\ncan't think of such a thing. Why, the fun has only just begun.'\n\n'Do you call last night fun?' questioned Racksole, gazing at her\nsolemnly.\n\n'Yes, I do,' she said promptly. 'Now.'\n\n'Well, I don't,' was the millionaire's laconic response; but perhaps he\nwas thinking of his own situation in the lift.\n\n'Do you not think we might investigate a little further,' said the\nPrince judiciously, as he cracked a walnut, 'just a little further--and\nthen, if we fail to accomplish anything, there would still be ample\nopportunity to consult the police?'\n\n'How do you suggest we should begin?' asked Racksole.\n\n'Well, there is the house which Miss Racksole so intrepidly entered last\nevening'--he gave her the homage of an admiring glance; 'you and I, Mr\nRacksole, might examine that abode in detail.'\n\n'To-night?'\n\n'Certainly. We might do something.'\n\n'We might do too much.'\n\n'For example?'\n\n'We might shoot someone, or get ourselves mistaken for burglars. If we\noutstepped the law, it would be no excuse for us that we had been acting\nin a good cause.'\n\n'True,' said the Prince. 'Nevertheless--' He stopped.\n\n'Nevertheless you have a distaste for bringing the police into the\nbusiness.\n\nYou want the hunt all to yourself. You are on fire with the ardour of\nthe chase. Is not that it? Accept the advice of an older man, Prince,\nand sleep on this affair. I have little fancy for nocturnal escapades\ntwo nights together. As for you, Nella, off with you to bed. The Prince\nand I will have a yarn over such fluids as can be obtained in this\nhole.'\n\n'Papa,' she said, 'you are perfectly horrid to-night.'\n\n'Perhaps I am,' he said. 'Decidedly I am very cross with you for coming\nover here all alone. It was monstrous. If I didn't happen to be the most\nfoolish of parents--There! Good-night. It's nine o'clock. The Prince, I\nam sure, will excuse you.'\n\nIf Nella had not really been very tired Prince Aribert might have been\nthe witness of a good-natured but stubborn conflict between the\nmillionaire and his spirited offspring. As it was, Nella departed with\nsurprising docility, and the two men were left alone.\n\n'Now,' said Racksole suddenly, changing his tone, 'I fancy that after\nall I'm your man for a little amateur investigation to-night. And, if I\nmust speak the exact truth, I think that to sleep on this affair would\nbe about the very worst thing we could do. But I was anxious to keep\nNella out of harm's way at any rate till to-morrow. She is a very\ndifficult creature to manage, Prince, and I may warn you,' he laughed\ngrimly, 'that if we do succeed in doing anything to-night we shall catch\nit from her ladyship in the morning. Are you ready to take that risk?'\n\n'I am,' the Prince smiled. 'But Miss Racksole is a young lady of quite\nremarkable nerve.'\n\n'She is,' said Racksole drily. 'I wish sometimes she had less.'\n\n'I have the highest admiration for Miss Racksole,' said the Prince, and\nhe looked Miss Racksole's father full in the face.\n\n'You honour us, Prince,' Racksole observed. 'Let us come to business. Am\nI right in assuming that you have a reason for keeping the police out of\nthis business, if it can possibly be done?'\n\n'Yes,' said the Prince, and his brow clouded. 'I am very much afraid\nthat my poor nephew has involved himself in some scrape that he would\nwish not to be divulged.'\n\n'Then you do not believe that he is the victim of foul play?'\n\n'I do not.'\n\n'And the reason, if I may ask it?'\n\n'Mr Racksole, we speak in confidence--is it not so? Some years ago my\nfoolish nephew had an affair--an affair with a feminine star of the\nBerlin stage. For anything I know, the lady may have been the very\npattern of her sex, but where a reigning Prince is concerned scandal\ncannot be avoided in such a matter. I had thought that the affair was\nquite at an end, since my nephew's betrothal to Princess Anna of\nEckstein-Schwartzburg is shortly to be announced. But yesterday I saw\nthe lady to whom I have referred driving on the Digue. The coincidence\nof her presence here with my nephew's disappearance is too extraordinary\nto be disregarded.'\n\n'But how does this theory square with the murder of Reginald Dimmock?'\n\n'It does not square with it. My idea is that the murder of poor Dimmock\nand the disappearance of my nephew are entirely unconnected--unless,\nindeed, this Berlin actress is playing into the hands of the murderers.\nI had not thought of that.'\n\n'Then what do you propose to do to-night?'\n\n'I propose to enter the house which Miss Racksole entered last night and\nto find out something definite.'\n\n'I concur,' said Racksole. 'I shall heartily enjoy it. But let me tell\nyou, Prince, and pardon me for speaking bluntly, your surmise is\nincorrect. I would wager a hundred thousand dollars that Prince Eugen\nhas been kidnapped.'\n\n'What grounds have you for being so sure?'\n\n'Ah! said Racksole, 'that is a long story. Let me begin by asking you\nthis.\n\nAre you aware that your nephew, Prince Eugen, owes a million of money?'\n\n'A million of money!' cried Prince Aribert astonished. 'It is\nimpossible!'\n\n'Nevertheless, he does,' said Racksole calmly. Then he told him all he\nhad learnt from Mr Sampson Levi.\n\n'What have you to say to that?' Racksole ended. Prince Aribert made no\nreply.\n\n'What have you to say to that?' Racksole insisted.\n\n'Merely that Eugen is ruined, even if he is alive.'\n\n'Not at all,' Racksole returned with cheerfulness. 'Not at all. We shall\nsee about that. The special thing that I want to know just now from you\nis this:\n\nHas any previous application ever been made for the hand of the Princess\nAnna?'\n\n'Yes. Last year. The King of Bosnia sued for it, but his proposal was\ndeclined.'\n\n'Why?'\n\n'Because my nephew was considered to be a more suitable match for her.'\n\n'Not because the personal character of his Majesty of Bosnia is scarcely\nof the brightest?'\n\n'No. Unfortunately it is usually impossible to consider questions of\npersonal character when a royal match is concerned.'\n\n'Then, if for any reason the marriage of Princess Anna with your nephew\nwas frustrated, the King of Bosnia would have a fair chance in that\nquarter?'\n\n'He would. The political aspect of things would be perfectly\nsatisfactory.'\n\n'Thanks!' said Racksole. 'I will wager another hundred thousand dollars\nthat someone in Bosnia--I don't accuse the King himself--is at the\nbottom of this business. The methods of Balkan politicians have always\nbeen half-Oriental. Let us go.'\n\n'Where?'\n\n'To this precious house of Nella's adventure.'\n\n'But surely it is too early?'\n\n'So it is,' said Racksole, 'and we shall want a few things, too. For\ninstance, a dark lantern. I think I will go out and forage for a\nlantern.'\n\n'And a revolver?' suggested Prince Aribert.\n\n'Does it mean revolvers?' The millionaire laughed. 'It may come to\nthat.' 'Here you are, then, my friend,' said Racksole, and he pulled one\nout of his hip pocket. 'And yours?'\n\n'I,' said the Prince, 'I have your daughter's.'\n\n'The deuce you have!' murmured Racksole to himself.\n\nIt was then half past nine. They decided that it would be impolitic to\nbegin their operations till after midnight. There were three hours to\nspare.\n\n'Let us go and see the gambling,' Racksole suggested. 'We might\nencounter the Berlin lady.'\n\nThe suggestion, in the first instance, was not made seriously, but it\nappeared to both men that they might do worse than spend the intervening\ntime in the gorgeous saloon of the Kursaal, where, in the season, as\nmuch money is won and lost as at Monte Carlo. It was striking ten\no'clock as they entered the rooms. There was a large company present--a\ncompany which included some of the most notorious persons in Europe. In\nthat multifarious assemblage all were equal. The electric light shone\ncoldly and impartially on the just and on the unjust, on the fool and\nthe knave, on the European and the Asiatic. As usual, women monopolized\nthe best places at the tables.\n\nThe scene was familiar enough to Prince Aribert, who had witnessed it\nfrequently at Monaco, but Theodore Racksole had never before entered any\nEuropean gaming palace; he had only the haziest idea of the rules of\nplay, and he was at once interested. For some time they watched the play\nat the table which happened to be nearest to them. Racksole never moved\nhis lips.\n\nWith his eyes glued on the table, and ears open for every remark, of the\nplayers and the croupier, he took his first lesson in roulette. He saw a\nmere youth win fifteen thousand francs, which were stolen in the most\nbarefaced manner by a rouged girl scarcely older than the youth; he saw\ntwo old gamesters stake their coins, and lose, and walk quietly out of\nthe place; he saw the bank win fifty thousand francs at a single turn.\n\n'This is rather good fun,' he said at length, 'but the stakes are too\nsmall to make it really exciting. I'll try my luck, just for the\nexperience. I'm bound to win.'\n\n'Why?' asked the Prince.\n\n'Because I always do, in games of chance,' Racksole answered with gay\nconfidence. 'It is my fate. Then to-night, you must remember, I shall be\na beginner, and you know the tyro's luck.'\n\nIn ten minutes the croupier of that table was obliged to suspend\noperations pending the arrival of a further supply of coin.\n\n'What did I tell you?' said Racksole, leading the way to another table\nfurther up the room. A hundred curious glances went after him. One old\nwoman, whose gay attire suggested a false youthfulness, begged him in\nFrench to stake a five-franc piece for her. She offered him the coin. He\ntook it, and gave her a hundred-franc note in exchange. She clutched the\ncrisp rustling paper, and with hysterical haste scuttled back to her own\ntable.\n\nAt the second table there was a considerable air of excitement. In the\nforefront of the players was a woman in a low-cut evening dress of black\nsilk and a large red picture hat. Her age appeared to be about twenty-\neight; she had dark eyes, full lips, and a distinctly Jewish nose. She\nwas handsome, but her beauty was of that forbidding, sinister order\nwhich is often called Junoesque. This woman was the centre of\nattraction. People said to each other that she had won a hundred and\nsixty thousand francs that day at the table.\n\n'You were right,' Prince Aribert whispered to Theodore Racksole; 'that\nis the Berlin lady.'\n\n'The deuce she is! Has she seen you? Will she know you?'\n\n'She would probably know me, but she hasn't looked up yet.'\n\n'Keep behind her, then. I propose to find her a little occupation.' By\ndint of a carefully-exercised diplomacy, Racksole manoeuvred himself\ninto a seat opposite to the lady in the red hat. The fame of his success\nat the other table had followed him, and people regarded him as a\nserious and formidable player. In the first turn the lady put a thousand\nfrancs on double zero; Racksole put a hundred on number nineteen and a\nthousand on the odd numbers.\n\nNineteen won. Racksole received four thousand four hundred francs. Nine\ntimes in succession Racksole backed number nineteen and the odd numbers;\nnine times the lady backed double zero. Nine times Racksole won and the\nlady lost. The other players, perceiving that the affair had resolved\nitself into a duel, stood back for the most part and watched those two.\nPrince Aribert never stirred from his position behind the great red hat.\nThe game continued. Racksole lost trifles from time to time, but ninety-\nnine hundredths of the luck was with him. As an English spectator at the\ntable remarked, 'he couldn't do wrong.' When midnight struck the lady in\nthe red hat was reduced to a thousand francs. Then she fell into a\nwinning vein for half an hour, but at one o'clock her resources were\nexhausted. Of the hundred and sixty thousand francs which she was\nreputed to have had early in the evening, Racksole held about ninety\nthousand, and the bank had the rest.\n\nIt was a calamity for the Juno of the red hat. She jumped up, stamped\nher foot, and hurried from the room. At a discreet distance Racksole and\nthe Prince pursued her.\n\n'It might be well to ascertain her movements,' said Racksole.\n\nOutside, in the glare of the great arc lights, and within sound of the\nsurf which beats always at the very foot of the Kursaal, the Juno of the\nred hat summoned a fiacre and drove rapidly away. Racksole and the\nPrince took an open carriage and started in pursuit. They had not,\nhowever, travelled more than half a mile when Prince Aribert stopped the\ncarriage, and, bidding Racksole get out, paid the driver and dismissed\nhim.\n\n'I feel sure I know where she is going,' he explained, 'and it will be\nbetter for us to follow on foot.'\n\n'You mean she is making for the scene of last night's affair?' said\nRacksole.\n\n'Exactly. We shall--what you call, kill two birds with one stone.'\n\nPrince Aribert's guess was correct. The lady's carriage stopped in front\nof the house where Nella Racksole and Miss Spencer had had their\ninterview on the previous evening, and the lady vanished into the\nbuilding just as the two men appeared at the end of the street. Instead\nof proceeding along that street, the Prince led Racksole to the lane\nwhich gave on to the backs of the houses, and he counted the houses as\nthey went up the lane. In a few minutes they had burglariously climbed\nover a wall, and crept, with infinite caution, up a long, narrow piece\nof ground--half garden, half paved yard, till they crouched under a\nwindow--a window which was shielded by curtains, but which had been left\nopen a little.\n\n'Listen,' said the Prince in his lightest whisper, 'they are talking.'\n\n'Who?'\n\n'The Berlin lady and Miss Spencer. I'm sure it's Miss Spencer's voice.'\n\nRacksole boldly pushed the french window a little wider open, and put\nhis ear to the aperture, through which came a beam of yellow light.\n\n'Take my place,' he whispered to the Prince, 'they're talking German.\nYou'll understand better.'\n\nSilently they exchanged places under the window, and the Prince listened\nintently.\n\n'Then you refuse?' Miss Spencer's visitor was saying.\n\nThere was no answer from Miss Spencer.\n\n'Not even a thousand francs? I tell you I've lost the whole twenty-five\nthousand.'\n\nAgain no answer.\n\n'Then I'll tell the whole story,' the lady went on, in an angry rush of\nwords. 'I did what I promised to do. I enticed him here, and you've got\nhim safe in your vile cellar, poor little man, and you won't give me a\npaltry thousand francs.'\n\n'You have already had your price.' The words were Miss Spencer's. They\nfell cold and calm on the night air.\n\n'I want another thousand.'\n\n'I haven't it.'\n\n'Then we'll see.'\n\nPrince Aribert heard a rustle of flying skirts; then another movement--a\ndoor banged, and the beam of light through the aperture of the window\nsuddenly disappeared. He pushed the window wide open. The room was in\ndarkness, and apparently empty.\n\n'Now for that lantern of yours,' he said eagerly to Theodore Racksole,\nafter he had translated to him the conversation of the two women,\nRacksole produced the dark lantern from the capacious pocket of his dust\ncoat, and lighted it. The ray flashed about the ground.\n\n'What is it?' exclaimed Prince Aribert with a swift cry, pointing to the\nground. The lantern threw its light on a perpendicular grating at their\nfeet, through which could be discerned a cellar. They both knelt down,\nand peered into the subterranean chamber. On a broken chair a young man\nsat listlessly with closed eyes, his head leaning heavily forward on his\nchest.\n\nIn the feeble light of the lantern he had the livid and ghastly\nappearance of a corpse.\n\n'Who can it be?' said Racksole.\n\n'It is Eugen,' was the Prince's low answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Seventeen THE RELEASE OF PRINCE EUGEN\n\n'EUGEN,' Prince Aribert called softly. At the sound of his own name the\nyoung man in the cellar feebly raised his head and stared up at the\ngrating which separated him from his two rescuers. But his features\nshowed no recognition. He gazed in an aimless, vague, silly manner for a\nfew seconds, his eyes blinking under the glare of the lantern, and then\nhis head slowly drooped again on to his chest. He was dressed in a dark\ntweed travelling suit, and Racksole observed that one sleeve--the left--\nwas torn across the upper part of the cuff, and that there were stains\nof dirt on the left shoulder. A soiled linen collar, which had lost all\nits starch and was half unbuttoned, partially encircled the captive's\nneck; his brown boots were unlaced; a cap, a handkerchief, a portion of\na watch-chain, and a few gold coins lay on the floor. Racksole flashed\nthe lantern into the corners of the cellar, but he could discover no\nother furniture except the chair on which the Hereditary Prince of Posen\nsat and a small deal table on which were a plate and a cup.\n\n'Eugen,' cried Prince Aribert once more, but this time his forlorn\nnephew made no response whatever, and then Aribert added in a low voice\nto Racksole: 'Perhaps he cannot see us clearly.'\n\n'But he must surely recognize your voice,' said Racksole, in a hard,\ngloomy tone. There was a pause, and the two men above ground looked at\neach other hesitatingly. Each knew that they must enter that cellar and\nget Prince Eugen out of it, and each was somehow afraid to take the next\nstep.\n\n'Thank God he is not dead!' said Aribert.\n\n'He may be worse than dead!' Racksole replied.\n\n'Worse than--What do you mean?'\n\n'I mean--he may be mad.'\n\n'Come,' Aribert almost shouted, with a sudden access of energy--a wild\nimpulse for action. And, snatching the lantern from Racksole, he rushed\ninto the dark room where they had heard the conversation of Miss Spencer\nand the lady in the red hat. For a moment Racksole did not stir from the\nthreshold of the window. 'Come,' Prince Aribert repeated, and there was\nan imperious command in his utterance. 'What are you afraid of?'\n\n'I don't know,' said Racksole, feeling stupid and queer; 'I don't know.'\n\nThen he marched heavily after Prince Aribert into the room. On the\nmantelpiece were a couple of candles which had been blown out, and in a\nmechanical, unthinking way, Racksole lighted them, and the two men\nglanced round the room. It presented no peculiar features: it was just\nan ordinary room, rather small, rather mean, rather shabby, with an ugly\nwallpaper and ugly pictures in ugly frames. Thrown over a chair was a\nman's evening-dress jacket. The door was closed. Prince Aribert turned\nthe knob, but he could not open it.\n\n'It's locked,' he said. 'Evidently they know we're here.'\n\n'Nonsense,' said Racksole brusquely; 'how can they know?' And, taking\nhold of the knob, he violently shook the door, and it opened. 'I told\nyou it wasn't locked,' he added, and this small success of opening the\ndoor seemed to steady the man. It was a curious psychological effect,\nthis terrorizing (for it amounted to that) of two courageous full-grown\nmen by the mere apparition of a helpless creature in a cellar. Gradually\nthey both recovered from it. The next moment they were out in the\npassage which led to the front door of the house. The front door stood\nopen. They looked into the street, up and down, but there was not a soul\nin sight. The street, lighted by three gas-lamps only, seemed strangely\nsinister and mysterious.\n\n'She has gone, that's clear,' said Racksole, meaning the woman with the\nred hat.\n\n'And Miss Spencer after her, do you think?' questioned Aribert.\n\n'No. She would stay. She would never dare to leave. Let us find the\ncellar steps.'\n\nThe cellar steps were happily not difficult to discover, for in moving a\npace backwards Prince Aribert had a narrow escape of precipitating\nhimself to the bottom of them. The lantern showed that they were built\non a curve.\n\nSilently Racksole resumed possession of the lantern and went first, the\nPrince close behind him. At the foot was a short passage, and in this\npassage crouched the figure of a woman. Her eyes threw back the rays of\nthe lantern, shining like a cat's at midnight. Then, as the men went\nnearer, they saw that it was Miss Spencer who barred their way. She\nseemed half to kneel on the stone floor, and in one hand she held what\nat first appeared to be a dagger, but which proved to be nothing more\nromantic than a rather long bread-knife.\n\n'I heard you, I heard you,' she exclaimed. 'Get back; you mustn't come\nhere.'\n\nThere was a desperate and dangerous look on her face, and her form shook\nwith scarcely controlled passionate energy.\n\n'Now see here, Miss Spencer,' Racksole said calmly, 'I guess we've had\nenough of this fandango. You'd better get up and clear out, or we'll\njust have to drag you off.'\n\nHe went calmly up to her, the lantern in his hand. Without another word\nshe struck the knife into his arm, and the lantern fell extinguished.\nRacksole gave a cry, rather of angry surprise than of pain, and\nretreated a few steps. In the darkness they could still perceive the\nglint of her eyes.\n\n'I told you you mustn't come here,' the woman said. 'Now get back.'\n\nRacksole positively laughed. It was a queer laugh, but he laughed, and\nhe could not help it. The idea of this woman, this bureau clerk,\nstopping his progress and that of Prince Aribert by means of a bread-\nknife aroused his sense of humour. He struck a match, relighted the\ncandle, and faced Miss Spencer once more.\n\n'I'll do it again,' she said, with a note of hard resolve.\n\n'Oh, no, you won't, my girl,' said Racksole; and he pulled out his\nrevolver, cocked it, raised his hand.\n\n'Put down that plaything of yours,' he said firmly.\n\n'No,' she answered.\n\n'I shall shoot.'\n\nShe pressed her lips together.\n\n'I shall shoot,' he repeated. 'One--two--three.'\n\nBang, bang! He had fired twice, purposely missing her. Miss Spencer\nnever blenched. Racksole was tremendously surprised--and he would have\nbeen a thousandfold more surprised could he have contrasted her\nbehaviour now with her abject terror on the previous evening when Nella\nhad threatened her.\n\n'You've got a bit of pluck,' he said, 'but it won't help you. Why won't\nyou let us pass?'\n\nAs a matter of fact, pluck was just what she had not, really; she had\nmerely subordinated one terror to another. She was desperately afraid of\nRacksole's revolver, but she was much more afraid of something else.\n\n'Why won't you let us pass?'\n\n'I daren't,' she said, with a plaintive tremor; 'Tom put me in charge.'\n\nThat was all. The men could see tears running down her poor wrinkled\nface.\n\nTheodore Racksole began to take off his light overcoat.\n\n'I see I must take my coat off to you,' he said, and he almost smiled.\nThen, with a quick movement, he threw the coat over Miss Spencer's head\nand flew at her, seizing both her arms, while Prince Aribert assisted.\n\nHer struggles ceased--she was beaten.\n\n'That's all right,' said Racksole: 'I could never have used that\nrevolver--to mean business with it, of course.'\n\nThey carried her, unresisting, upstairs and on to the upper floor, where\nthey locked her in a bedroom. She lay in the bed as if exhausted.\n\n'Now for my poor Eugen,' said Prince Aribert.\n\n'Don't you think we'd better search the house first?' Racksole\nsuggested; 'it will be safer to know just how we stand. We can't afford\nany ambushes or things of that kind, you know.'\n\nThe Prince agreed, and they searched the house from top to bottom, but\nfound no one. Then, having locked the front door and the french window\nof the sitting-room, they proceeded again to the cellar.\n\nHere a new obstacle confronted them. The cellar door was, of course,\nlocked; there was no sign of a key, and it appeared to be a heavy door.\nThey were compelled to return to the bedroom where Miss Spencer was\nincarcerated, in order to demand the key of the cellar from her. She\nstill lay without movement on the bed.\n\n'Tom's got it,' she replied, faintly, to their question: 'Tom's got it,\nI swear to you. He took it for safety.'\n\n'Then how do you feed your prisoner?' Racksole asked sharply.\n\n'Through the grating,' she answered.\n\nBoth men shuddered. They felt she was speaking the truth. For the third\ntime they went to the cellar door. In vain Racksole thrust himself\nagainst it; he could do no more than shake it.\n\n'Let's try both together,' said Prince Aribert. 'Now!' There was a\ncrack.\n\n'Again,' said Prince Aribert. There was another crack, and then the\nupper hinge gave way. The rest was easy. Over the wreck of the door they\nentered Prince Eugen's prison.\n\nThe captive still sat on his chair. The terrific noise and bustle of\nbreaking down the door seemed not to have aroused him from his lethargy,\nbut when Prince Aribert spoke to him in German he looked at his uncle.\n\n'Will you not come with us, Eugen?' said Prince Aribert; 'you needn't\nstay here any longer, you know.'\n\n'Leave me alone,' was the strange reply; 'leave me alone. What do you\nwant?'\n\n'We are here to get you out of this scrape,' said Aribert gently.\nRacksole stood aside.\n\n'Who is that fellow?' said Eugen sharply.\n\n'That is my friend Mr Racksole, an Englishman--or rather, I should say,\nan American--to whom we owe a great deal. Come and have supper, Eugen.'\n\n'I won't,' answered Eugen doggedly. 'I'm waiting here for her. You\ndidn't think anyone had kept me here, did you, against my will? I tell\nyou I'm waiting for her. She said she'd come.'\n\n'Who is she?' Aribert asked, humouring him.\n\n'She! Why, you know! I forgot, of course, you don't know. You mustn't\nask.\n\nDon't pry, Uncle Aribert. She was wearing a red hat.'\n\n'I'll take you to her, my dear Eugen.' Prince Aribert put his hands on\nthe other's shoulder, but Eugen shook him off violently, stood up, and\nthen sat down again.\n\nAribert looked at Racksole, and they both looked at Prince Eugen. The\nlatter's face was flushed, and Racksole observed that the left pupil was\nmore dilated than the right. The man started, muttered odd, fragmentary\nscraps of sentences, now grumbling, now whining.\n\n'His mind is unhinged,' Racksole whispered in English.\n\n'Hush!' said Prince Aribert. 'He understands English.' But Prince Eugen\ntook no notice of the brief colloquy.\n\n'We had better get him upstairs, somehow,' said Racksole.\n\n'Yes,' Aribert assented. 'Eugen, the lady with the red hat, the lady you\nare waiting for, is upstairs. She has sent us down to ask you to come\nup. Won't you come?'\n\n'Himmel!' the poor fellow exclaimed, with a kind of weak anger. 'Why did\nyou not say this before?'\n\nHe rose, staggered towards Aribert, and fell headlong on the floor. He\nhad swooned. The two men raised him, carried him up the stone steps, and\nlaid him with infinite care on a sofa. He lay, breathing queerly through\nthe nostrils, his eyes closed, his fingers contracted; every now and\nthen a convulsion ran through his frame.\n\n'One of us must fetch a doctor,' said Prince Aribert.\n\n'I will,' said Racksole. At that moment there was a quick, curt rap on\nthe french window, and both Racksole and the Prince glanced round\nstartled. A girl's face was pressed against the large window-pane. It\nwas Nella's.\n\nRacksole unfastened the catch, and she entered.\n\n'I have found you,' she said lightly; 'you might have told me. I\ncouldn't sleep. I inquired from the h\u00c3\u00b4tel-folks if you had retired, and\nthey said no; so I slipped out. I guessed where you were.' Racksole\ninterrupted her with a question as to what she meant by this escapade,\nbut she stopped him with a careless gesture. 'What's this?' She pointed\nto the form on the sofa.\n\n'That is my nephew, Prince Eugen,' said Aribert.\n\n'Hurt?' she inquired coldly. 'I hope not.'\n\n'He is ill,' said Racksole, 'his brain is turned.'\n\nNella began to examine the unconscious Prince with the expert movements\nof a girl who had passed through the best hospital course to be obtained\nin New York.\n\n'He has got brain fever,' she said. 'That is all, but it will be enough.\nDo you know if there is a bed anywhere in this remarkable house?'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Eighteen IN THE NIGHT-TIME\n\n'HE must on no account be moved,' said the dark little Belgian doctor,\nwhose eyes seemed to peer so quizzically through his spectacles; and he\nsaid it with much positiveness.\n\nThat pronouncement rather settled their plans for them. It was certainly\na professional triumph for Nella, who, previous to the doctor's arrival,\nhad told them the very same thing. Considerable argument had passed\nbefore the doctor was sent for. Prince Aribert was for keeping the whole\naffair a deep secret among their three selves. Theodore Racksole agreed\nso far, but he suggested further that at no matter what risk they should\ntransport the patient over to England at once. Racksole had an idea that\nhe should feel safer in that h\u00c3\u00b4tel of his, and better able to deal with\nany situation that might arise. Nella scorned the idea. In her quality\nof an amateur nurse, she assured them that Prince Eugen was much more\nseriously ill than either of them suspected, and she urged that they\nshould take absolute possession of the house, and keep possession till\nPrince Eugen was convalescent.\n\n'But what about the Spencer female?' Racksole had said.\n\n'Keep her where she is. Keep her a prisoner. And hold the house against\nall comers. If Jules should come back, simply defy him to enter--that is\nall.\n\nThere are two of you, so you must keep an eye on the former occupiers,\nif they return, and on Miss Spencer, while I nurse the patient. But\nfirst, you must send for a doctor.'\n\n'Doctor!' Prince Aribert had said, alarmed. 'Will it not be necessary to\nmake some awkward explanation to the doctor?'\n\n'Not at all!' she replied. 'Why should it be? In a place like Ostend\ndoctors are far too discreet to ask questions; they see too much to\nretain their curiosity. Besides, do you want your nephew to die?'\n\nBoth the men were somewhat taken aback by the girl's sagacious grasp of\nthe situation, and it came about that they began to obey her like\nsubordinates.\n\nShe told her father to sally forth in search of a doctor, and he went.\nShe gave Prince Aribert certain other orders, and he promptly executed\nthem.\n\nBy the evening of the following day, everything was going smoothly. The\ndoctor came and departed several times, and sent medicine, and seemed\nfairly optimistic as to the issue of the illness. An old woman had been\ninduced to come in and cook and clean. Miss Spencer was kept out of\nsight on the attic floor, pending some decision as to what to do with\nher. And no one outside the house had asked any questions. The\ninhabitants of that particular street must have been accustomed to\nstrange behaviour on the part of their neighbours, unaccountable\nappearances and disappearances, strange flittings and arrivals. This\nstrong-minded and active trio--Racksole, Nella, and Prince Aribert--\nmight have been the lawful and accustomed tenants of the house, for any\noutward evidence to the contrary.\n\nOn the afternoon of the third day Prince Eugen was distinctly and\nseriously worse. Nella had sat up with him the previous night and\nthroughout the day.\n\nHer father had spent the morning at the h\u00c3\u00b4tel, and Prince Aribert had\nkept watch. The two men were never absent from the house at the same\ntime, and one of them always did duty as sentinel at night. On this\nafternoon Prince Aribert and Nella sat together in the patient's\nbedroom. The doctor had just left. Theodore Racksole was downstairs\nreading the New York Herald. The Prince and Nella were near the window,\nwhich looked on to the back-garden.\n\nIt was a queer shabby little bedroom to shelter the august body of a\nEuropean personage like Prince Eugen of Posen. Curiously enough, both\nNella and her father, ardent democrats though they were, had been\nsomehow impressed by the royalty and importance of the fever-stricken\nPrince--impressed as they had never been by Aribert. They had both felt\nthat here, under their care, was a species of individuality quite new to\nthem, and different from anything they had previously encountered. Even\nthe gestures and tones of his delirium had an air of abrupt yet\ncondescending command--an imposing mixture of suavity and haughtiness.\nAs for Nella, she had been first struck by the beautiful 'E' over a\ncrown on the sleeves of his linen, and by the signet ring on his pale,\nemaciated hand. After all, these trifling outward signs are at least as\neffective as others of deeper but less obtrusive significance. The\nRacksoles, too, duly marked the attitude of Prince Aribert to his\nnephew: it was at once paternal and reverential; it disclosed clearly\nthat Prince Aribert continued, in spite of everything, to regard his\nnephew as his sovereign lord and master, as a being surrounded by a\nnatural and inevitable pomp and awe. This attitude, at the beginning,\nseemed false and unreal to the Americans; it seemed to them to be\nassumed; but gradually they came to perceive that they were mistaken,\nand that though America might have cast out 'the monarchial\nsuperstition', nevertheless that 'superstition' had vigorously survived\nin another part of the world.\n\n'You and Mr Racksole have been extraordinarily kind to me,' said Prince\nAribert very quietly, after the two had sat some time in silence.\n\n'Why? How?' she asked unaffectedly. 'We are interested in this affair\nourselves, you know. It began at our h\u00c3\u00b4tel--you mustn't forget that,\nPrince.'\n\n'I don't,' he said. 'I forget nothing. But I cannot help feeling that I\nhave led you into a strange entanglement. Why should you and Mr Racksole\nbe here--you who are supposed to be on a holiday!--hiding in a strange\nhouse in a foreign country, subject to all sorts of annoyances and all\nsorts of risks, simply because I am anxious to avoid scandal, to avoid\nany sort of talk, in connection with my misguided nephew? It is nothing\nto you that the Hereditary Prince of Posen should be liable to a public\ndisgrace. What will it matter to you if the throne of Posen becomes the\nlaughing-stock of Europe?'\n\n'I really don't know, Prince,' Nella smiled roguishly. 'But we Americans\nhave, a habit of going right through with anything we have begun.'\n\n'Ah!' he said, 'who knows how this thing will end? All our trouble, our\nanxieties, our watchfulness, may come to nothing. I tell you that when I\nsee Eugen lying there, and think that we cannot learn his story until he\nrecovers, I am ready to go mad. We might be arranging things, making\nmatters smooth, preparing for the future, if only we knew--knew what he\ncan tell us. I tell you that I am ready to go mad. If anything should\nhappen to you, Miss Racksole, I would kill myself.'\n\n'But why?' she questioned. 'Supposing, that is, that anything could\nhappen to me--which it can't.'\n\n'Because I have dragged you into this,' he replied, gazing at her. 'It\nis nothing to you. You are only being kind.'\n\n'How do you know it is nothing to me, Prince?' she asked him quickly.\n\nJust then the sick man made a convulsive movement, and Nella flew to the\nbed and soothed him. From the head of the bed she looked over at Prince\nAribert, and he returned her bright, excited glance. She was in her\ntravelling-frock, with a large white Belgian apron tied over it. Large\ndark circles of fatigue and sleeplessness surrounded her eyes, and to\nthe Prince her cheek seemed hollow and thin; her hair lay thick over the\ntemples, half covering the ears. Aribert gave no answer to her query--\nmerely gazed at her with melancholy intensity.\n\n'I think I will go and rest,' she said at last. 'You will know all about\nthe medicine.'\n\n'Sleep well,' he said, as he softly opened the door for her. And then he\nwas alone with Eugen. It was his turn that night to watch, for they\nstill half-expected some strange, sudden visit, or onslaught, or move of\none kind or another from Jules. Racksole slept in the parlour on the\nground floor.\n\nNella had the front bedroom on the first floor; Miss Spencer was immured\nin the attic; the last-named lady had been singularly quiet and\nincurious, taking her food from Nella and asking no questions, the old\nwoman went at nights to her own abode in the purlieus of the harbour.\nHour after hour Aribert sat silent by his nephew's bed-side, attending\nmechanically to his wants, and every now and then gazing hard into the\nvacant, anguished face, as if trying to extort from that mask the\nsecrets which it held. Aribert was tortured by the idea that if he could\nhave only half an hour's, only a quarter of an hour's, rational speech\nwith Prince Eugen, all might be cleared up and put right, and by the\nfact that that rational talk was absolutely impossible on Eugen's part\nuntil the fever had run its course. As the minutes crept on to midnight\nthe watcher, made nervous by the intense, electrical atmosphere which\nseems always to surround a person who is dangerously ill, grew more and\nmore a prey to vague and terrible apprehensions. His mind dwelt\nhysterically on the most fatal possibilities.\n\nHe wondered what would occur if by any ill-chance Eugen should die in\nthat bed--how he would explain the affair to Posen and to the Emperor,\nhow he would justify himself. He saw himself being tried for murder,\nsentenced (him--a Prince of the blood!), led to the scaffold... a scene\nunparalleled in Europe for over a century! ... Then he gazed anew at the\nsick man, and thought he saw death in every drawn feature of that\nagonized face. He could have screamed aloud. His ears heard a peculiar\nresonant boom. He started--it was nothing but the city clock striking\ntwelve. But there was another sound--a mysterious shuffle at the door.\nHe listened; then jumped from his chair. Nothing now! Nothing! But still\nhe felt drawn to the door, and after what seemed an interminable\ninterval he went and opened it, his heart beating furiously. Nella lay\nin a heap on the door mat. She was fully dressed, but had apparently\nlost consciousness. He clutched at her slender body, picked her up,\ncarried her to the chair by the fire-place, and laid her in it. He had\nforgotten all about Eugen.\n\n'What is it, my angel?' he whispered, and then he kissed her--kissed her\ntwice. He could only look at her; he did not know what to do to succour\nher.\n\nAt last she opened her eyes and sighed.\n\n'Where am I?' she asked vaguely, in a tremulous tone as she recognized\nhim. 'Is it you? Did I do anything silly? Did I faint?'\n\n'What has happened? Were you ill?' he questioned anxiously. He was\nkneeling at her feet, holding her hand tight.\n\n'I saw Jules by the side of my bed,' she murmured; 'I'm sure I saw him;\nhe laughed at me. I had not undressed. I sprang up, frightened, but he\nhad gone, and then I ran downstairs--to you.'\n\n'You were dreaming,' he soothed her.\n\n'Was I?'\n\n'You must have been. I have not heard a sound. No one could have\nentered.\n\nBut if you like I will wake Mr Racksole.'\n\n'Perhaps I was dreaming,' she admitted. 'How foolish!'\n\n'You were over-tired,' he said, still unconsciously holding her hand.\nThey gazed at each other. She smiled at him.\n\n'You kissed me,' she said suddenly, and he blushed red and stood up\nbefore her. 'Why did you kiss me?'\n\n'Ah! Miss Racksole,' he murmured, hurrying the words out. 'Forgive me.\nIt is unforgivable, but forgive me. I was overpowered by my feelings. I\ndid not know what I was doing.'\n\n'Why did you kiss me?' she repeated.\n\n'Because--Nella! I love you. I have no right to say it.'\n\n'Why have you no right to say it?'\n\n'If Eugen dies, I shall owe a duty to Posen--I shall be its ruler.'\n\n'Well!' she said calmly, with an adorable confidence. 'Papa is worth\nforty millions. Would you not abdicate?'\n\n'Ah!' he gave a low cry. 'Will you force me to say these things? I could\nnot shirk my duty to Posen, and the reigning Prince of Posen can only\nmarry a Princess.'\n\n'But Prince Eugen will live,' she said positively, 'and if he lives--'\n\n'Then I shall be free. I would renounce all my rights to make you mine,\nif--if--'\n\n'If what, Prince?'\n\n'If you would deign to accept my hand.'\n\n'Am I, then, rich enough?'\n\n'Nella!' He bent down to her.\n\nThen there was a crash of breaking glass. Aribert went to the window and\nopened it. In the starlit gloom he could see that a ladder had been\nraised against the back of the house. He thought he heard footsteps at\nthe end of the garden.\n\n'It was Jules,' he exclaimed to Nella, and without another word rushed\nupstairs to the attic. The attic was empty. Miss Spencer had\nmysteriously vanished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Nineteen ROYALTY AT THE GRAND BABYLON\n\nTHE Royal apartments at the Grand Babylon are famous in the world of\nh\u00c3\u00b4tels, and indeed elsewhere, as being, in their own way, unsurpassed.\nSome of the palaces of Germany, and in particular those of the mad\nLudwig of Bavaria, may possess rooms and saloons which outshine them in\ngorgeous luxury and the mere wild fairy-like extravagance of wealth; but\nthere is nothing, anywhere, even on Eighth Avenue, New York, which can\nfairly be called more complete, more perfect, more enticing, or--not\nleast important--more comfortable.\n\nThe suite consists of six chambers--the ante-room, the saloon or\naudience chamber, the dining-room, the yellow drawing-room (where\nRoyalty receives its friends), the library, and the State bedroom--to\nthe last of which we have already been introduced. The most important\nand most impressive of these is, of course, the audience chamber, an\napartment fifty feet long by forty feet broad, with a superb outlook\nover the Thames, the Shot Tower, and the higher signals of the South-\nWestern Railway. The decoration of this room is mainly in the German\ntaste, since four out of every six of its Royal occupants are of\nTeutonic blood; but its chief glory is its French ceiling, a masterpiece\nby Fragonard, taken bodily from a certain famous palace on the Loire.\nThe walls are of panelled oak, with an eight-foot dado of Arras cloth\nimitated from unique Continental examples. The carpet, woven in one\npiece, is an antique specimen of the finest Turkish work, and it was\nobtained, a bargain, by Felix Babylon, from an impecunious Roumanian\nPrince. The silver candelabra, now fitted with electric light, came from\nthe Rhine, and each had a separate history. The Royal chair--it is not\netiquette to call it a throne, though it amounts to a throne--was looted\nby Napoleon from an Austrian city, and bought by Felix Babylon at the\nsale of a French collector. At each corner of the room stands a gigantic\ngrotesque vase of German fa\u00c3\u00afence of the sixteenth century. These were\npresented to Felix Babylon by William the First of Germany, upon the\nconclusion of his first incognito visit to London in connection with the\nFrench trouble of 1875.\n\nThere is only one picture in the audience chamber. It is a portrait of\nthe luckless but noble Dom Pedro, Emperor of the Brazils. Given to Felix\nBabylon by Dom Pedro himself, it hangs there solitary and sublime as a\nreminder to Kings and Princes that Empires may pass away and greatness\nfall. A certain Prince who was occupying the suite during the Jubilee of\n1887--when the Grand Babylon had seven persons of Royal blood under its\nroof--sent a curt message to Felix that the portrait must be removed.\nFelix respectfully declined to remove it, and the Prince left for\nanother h\u00c3\u00b4tel, where he was robbed of two thousand pounds' worth of\njewellery. The Royal audience chamber of the Grand Babylon, if people\nonly knew it, is one of the sights of London, but it is never shown, and\nif you ask the h\u00c3\u00b4tel servants about its wonders they will tell you only\nfoolish facts concerning it, as that the Turkey carpet costs fifty\npounds to clean, and that one of the great vases is cracked across the\npedestal, owing to the rough treatment accorded to it during a riotous\ngame of Blind Man's Buff, played one night by four young Princesses, a\nBalkan King, and his aides-de-camp.\n\nIn one of the window recesses of this magnificent apartment, on a\ncertain afternoon in late July, stood Prince Aribert of Posen. He was\nfaultlessly dressed in the conventional frock-coat of English\ncivilization, with a gardenia in his button-hole, and the indispensable\ncrease down the front of the trousers. He seemed to be fairly amused,\nand also to expect someone, for at frequent intervals he looked rapidly\nover his shoulder in the direction of the door behind the Royal chair.\nAt last a little wizened, stooping old man, with a distinctly German\ncast of countenance, appeared through the door, and laid some papers on\na small table by the side of the chair.\n\n'Ah, Hans, my old friend!' said Aribert, approaching the old man. 'I\nmust have a little talk with you about one or two matters. How do you\nfind His Royal Highness?'\n\nThe old man saluted, military fashion. 'Not very well, your Highness,'\nhe answered. 'I've been valet to your Highness's nephew since his\nmajority, and I was valet to his Royal father before him, but I never\nsaw--' He stopped, and threw up his wrinkled hands deprecatingly.\n\n'You never saw what?' Aribert smiled affectionately on the old fellow.\nYou could perceive that these two, so sharply differentiated in rank,\nhad been intimate in the past, and would be intimate again.\n\n'Do you know, my Prince,' said the old man, 'that we are to receive the\nfinancier, Sampson Levi--is that his name?--in the audience chamber?\nSurely, if I may humbly suggest, the library would have been good enough\nfor a financier?'\n\n'One would have thought so,' agreed Prince Aribert, 'but perhaps your\nmaster has a special reason. Tell me,' he went on, changing the subject\nquickly, 'how came it that you left the Prince, my nephew, at Ostend,\nand returned to Posen?'\n\n'His orders, Prince,' and old Hans, who had had a wide experience of\nRoyal whims and knew half the secrets of the Courts of Europe, gave\nAribert a look which might have meant anything. 'He sent me back on an--\nan errand, your Highness.'\n\n'And you were to rejoin him here?'\n\n'Just so, Highness. And I did rejoin him here, although, to tell the\ntruth, I had begun to fear that I might never see my master again.'\n\n'The Prince has been very ill in Ostend, Hans.'\n\n'So I have gathered,' Hans responded drily, slowly rubbing his hands\ntogether. 'And his Highness is not yet perfectly recovered.'\n\n'Not yet. We despaired of his life, Hans, at one time, but thanks to an\nexcellent constitution, he came safely through the ordeal.'\n\n'We must take care of him, your Highness.'\n\n'Yes, indeed,' said Aribert solemnly, 'his life is very precious to\nPosen.'\n\nAt that moment, Eugen, Hereditary Prince of Posen, entered the audience\nchamber. He was pale and languid, and his uniform seemed to be a trouble\nto him. His hair had been slightly ruffled, and there was a look of\nuneasiness, almost of alarmed unrest, in his fine dark eyes. He was like\na man who is afraid to look behind him lest he should see something\nthere which ought not to be there. But at the same time, here beyond\ndoubt was Royalty. Nothing could have been more striking than the\ncontrast between Eugen, a sick man in the shabby house at Ostend, and\nthis Prince Eugen in the Royal apartments of the Grand Babylon H\u00c3\u00b4tel,\nsurrounded by the luxury and pomp which modern civilization can offer to\nthose born in high places. All the desperate episode of Ostend was now\nhidden, passed over. It was supposed never to have occurred. It existed\nonly like a secret shame in the hearts of those who had witnessed it.\nPrince Eugen had recovered; at any rate, he was convalescent, and he had\nbeen removed to London, where he took up again the dropped thread of his\nprincely life. The lady with the red hat, the incorruptible and savage\nMiss Spencer, the unscrupulous and brilliant Jules, the dark, damp\ncellar, the horrible little bedroom--these things were over. Thanks to\nPrince Aribert and the Racksoles, he had emerged from them in safety. He\nwas able to resume his public and official career. The Emperor had been\ninformed of his safe arrival in London, after an unavoidable delay in\nOstend; his name once more figured in the Court chronicle of the\nnewspapers. In short, everything was smothered over. Only--only Jules,\nRocco, and Miss Spencer were still at large; and the body of Reginald\nDimmock lay buried in the domestic mausoleum of the palace at Posen; and\nPrince Eugen had still to interview Mr Sampson Levi.\n\nThat various matters lay heavy on the mind of Prince Eugen was beyond\nquestion. He seemed to have withdrawn within himself. Despite the\nextraordinary experiences through which he had recently passed, events\nwhich called aloud for explanations and confidence between the nephew\nand the uncle, he would say scarcely a word to Prince Aribert. Any\nallusion, however direct, to the days at Ostend, was ignored by him with\nmore or less ingenuity, and Prince Aribert was really no nearer a full\nsolution of the mystery of Jules' plot than he had been on the night\nwhen he and Racksole visited the gaming tables at Ostend. Eugen was well\naware that he had been kidnapped through the agency of the woman in the\nred hat, but, doubtless ashamed at having been her dupe, he would not\nproceed in any way with the clearing-up of the matter.\n\n'You will receive in this room, Eugen?' Aribert questioned him.\n\n'Yes,' was the answer, given pettishly. 'Why not? Even if I have no\nproper retinue here, surely that is no reason why I should not hold\naudience in a proper manner?... Hans, you can go.' The old valet\npromptly disappeared.\n\n'Aribert,' the Hereditary Prince continued, when they were alone in the\nchamber, 'you think I am mad.'\n\n'My dear Eugen,' said Prince Aribert, startled in spite of himself.\n'Don't be absurd.'\n\n'I say you think I am mad. You think that that attack of brain fever has\nleft its permanent mark on me. Well, perhaps I am mad. Who can tell? God\nknows that I have been through enough lately to drive me mad.'\n\nAribert made no reply. As a matter of strict fact, the thought had\ncrossed his mind that Eugen's brain had not yet recovered its normal\ntone and activity. This speech of his nephew's, however, had the effect\nof immediately restoring his belief in the latter's entire sanity. He\nfelt convinced that if only he could regain his nephew's confidence, the\nold brotherly confidence which had existed between them since the years\nwhen they played together as boys, all might yet be well. But at present\nthere appeared to be no sign that Eugen meant to give his confidence to\nanyone.\n\nThe young Prince had come up out of the valley of the shadow of death,\nbut some of the valley's shadow had clung to him, and it seemed he was\nunable to dissipate it.\n\n'By the way,' said Eugen suddenly, 'I must reward these Racksoles, I\nsuppose. I am indeed grateful to them. If I gave the girl a bracelet,\nand the father a thousand guineas--how would that meet the case?'\n\n'My dear Eugen!' exclaimed Aribert aghast. 'A thousand guineas! Do you\nknow that Theodore Racksole could buy up all Posen from end to end\nwithout making himself a pauper. A thousand guineas! You might as well\noffer him sixpence.'\n\n'Then what must I offer?'\n\n'Nothing, except your thanks. Anything else would be an insult. These\nare no ordinary h\u00c3\u00b4tel people.'\n\n'Can't I give the little girl a bracelet?' Prince Eugen gave a sinister\nlaugh.\n\nAribert looked at him steadily. 'No,' he said.\n\n'Why did you kiss her--that night?' asked Prince Eugen carelessly.\n\n'Kiss whom?' said Aribert, blushing and angry, despite his most\ndetermined efforts to keep calm and unconcerned.\n\n'The Racksole girl.'\n\n'When do you mean?'\n\n'I mean,' said Prince Eugen, 'that night in Ostend when I was ill. You\nthought I was in a delirium. Perhaps I was. But somehow I remember that\nwith extraordinary distinctness. I remember raising my head for a\nfraction of an instant, and just in that fraction of an instant you\nkissed her. Oh, Uncle Aribert!'\n\n'Listen, Eugen, for God's sake. I love Nella Racksole. I shall marry\nher.'\n\n'You!' There was a long pause, and then Eugen laughed. 'Ah!' he said.\n'They all talk like that to start with. I have talked like that myself,\ndear uncle; it sounds nice, and it means nothing.'\n\n'In this case it means everything, Eugen,' said Aribert quietly. Some\naccent of determination in the latter's tone made Eugen rather more\nserious.\n\n'You can't marry her,' he said. 'The Emperor won't permit a morganatic\nmarriage.'\n\n'The Emperor has nothing to do with the affair. I shall renounce my\nrights.\n\nI shall become a plain citizen.'\n\n'In which case you will have no fortune to speak of.'\n\n'But my wife will have a fortune. Knowing the sacrifices which I shall\nhave made in order to marry her, she will not hesitate to place that\nfortune in my hands for our mutual use,' said Aribert stiffly.\n\n'You will decidedly be rich,' mused Eugen, as his ideas dwelt on\nTheodore Racksole's reputed wealth. 'But have you thought of this,' he\nasked, and his mild eyes glowed again in a sort of madness. 'Have you\nthought that I am unmarried, and might die at any moment, and then the\nthrone will descend to you--to you, Aribert?'\n\n'The throne will never descend to me, Eugen,' said Aribert softly, 'for\nyou will live. You are thoroughly convalescent. You have nothing to\nfear.'\n\n'It is the next seven days that I fear,' said Eugen.\n\n'The next seven days! Why?'\n\n'I do not know. But I fear them. If I can survive them--'\n\n'Mr Sampson Levi, sire,' Hans announced in a loud tone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twenty MR SAMPSON LEVI BIDS PRINCE EUGEN GOOD MORNING\n\nPRINCE EUGEN started. 'I will see him,' he said, with a gesture to Hans\nas if to indicate that Mr Sampson Levi might enter at once.\n\n'I beg one moment first,' said Aribert, laying a hand gently on his\nnephew's arm, and giving old Hans a glance which had the effect of\nprecipitating that admirably trained servant through the doorway.\n\n'What is it?' asked Prince Eugen crossly. 'Why this sudden seriousness?\nDon't forget that I have an appointment with Mr Sampson Levi, and must\nnot keep him waiting. Someone said that punctuality is the politeness of\nprinces.'\n\n'Eugen,' said Aribert, 'I wish you to be as serious as I am. Why cannot\nwe have faith in each other? I want to help you. I have helped you. You\nare my titular Sovereign; but on the other hand I have the honour to be\nyour uncle:\n\nI have the honour to be the same age as you, and to have been your\ncompanion from youth up. Give me your confidence. I thought you had\ngiven it me years ago, but I have lately discovered that you had your\nsecrets, even then. And now, since your illness, you are still more\nsecretive.'\n\n'What do you mean, Aribert?' said Eugen, in a tone which might have been\neither inimical or friendly. 'What do you want to say?'\n\n'Well, in the first place, I want to say that you will not succeed with\nthe estimable Mr Sampson Levi.'\n\n'Shall I not?' said Eugen lightly. 'How do you know what my business is\nwith him?'\n\n'Suffice it to say that I know. You will never get that million pounds\nout of him.'\n\nPrince Eugen gasped, and then swallowed his excitement. 'Who has been\ntalking? What million?' His eyes wandered uneasily round the room. 'Ah!'\nhe said, pretending to laugh. 'I see how it is. I have been chattering\nin my delirium. You mustn't take any notice of that, Aribert. When one\nhas a fever one's ideas become grotesque and fanciful.'\n\n'You never talked in your delirium,' Aribert replied; 'at least not\nabout yourself. I knew about this projected loan before I saw you in\nOstend.'\n\n'Who told you?' demanded Eugen fiercely.\n\n'Then you admit that you are trying to raise a loan?'\n\n'I admit nothing. Who told you?'\n\n'Theodore Racksole, the millionaire. These rich men have no secrets from\neach other. They form a coterie, closer than any coterie of ours. Eugen,\nand far more powerful. They talk, and in talking they rule the world,\nthese millionaires. They are the real monarchs.'\n\n'Curse them!' said Eugen.\n\n'Yes, perhaps so. But let me return to your case. Imagine my shame, my\ndisgust, when I found that Racksole could tell me more about your\naffairs than I knew myself. Happily, he is a good fellow; one can trust\nhim; otherwise I should have been tempted to do something desperate when\nI discovered that all your private history was in his hands. Eugen, let\nus come to the point; why do you want that million? Is it actually true\nthat you are so deeply in debt? I have no desire to improve the\noccasion. I merely ask.'\n\n'And what if I do owe a million?' said Prince Eugen with assumed valour.\n\n'Oh, nothing, my dear Eugen, nothing. Only it is rather a large sum to\nhave scattered in ten years, is it not? How did you manage it?'\n\n'Don't ask me, Aribert. I've been a fool. But I swear to you that the\nwoman whom you call \"the lady in the red hat\" is the last of my follies.\nI am about to take a wife, and become a respectable Prince.'\n\n'Then the engagement with Princess Anna is an accomplished fact?'\n\n'Practically so. As soon as I have settled with Levi, all will be\nsmooth.\n\nAribert, I wouldn't lose Anna for the Imperial throne. She is a good and\npure woman, and I love her as a man might love an angel.'\n\n'And yet you would deceive her as to your debts, Eugen?'\n\n'Not her, but her absurd parents, and perhaps the Emperor. They have\nheard rumours, and I must set those rumours at rest by presenting to\nthem a clean sheet.'\n\n'I am glad you have been frank with me, Eugen,' said Prince Aribert,\n'but I will be plain with you. You will never marry the Princess Anna.'\n\n'And why?' said Eugen, supercilious again.\n\n'Because her parents will not permit it. Because you will not be able to\npresent a clean sheet to them. Because this Sampson Levi will never lend\nyou a million.'\n\n'Explain yourself.'\n\n'I propose to do so. You were kidnapped--it is a horrid word, but we\nmust use it--in Ostend.'\n\n'True.'\n\n'Do you know why?'\n\n'I suppose because that vile old red-hatted woman and her accomplices\nwanted to get some money out of me. Fortunately, thanks to you, they\ndidn't.'\n\n'Not at all,' said Aribert. 'They wanted no money from you. They knew\nwell enough that you had no money. They knew you were the naughty\nschoolboy among European Princes, with no sense of responsibility or of\nduty towards your kingdom. Shall I tell you why they kidnapped you?'\n\n'When you have done abusing me, my dear uncle.'\n\n'They kidnapped you merely to keep you out of England for a few days,\nmerely to compel you to fail in your appointment with Sampson Levi. And\nit appears to me that they succeeded. Assuming that you don't obtain the\nmoney from Levi, is there another financier in all Europe from whom you\ncan get it--on such strange security as you have to offer?'\n\n'Possibly there is not,' said Prince Eugen calmly. 'But, you see, I\nshall get it from Sampson Levi. Levi promised it, and I know from other\nsources that he is a man of his word. He said that the money, subject to\ncertain formalities, would be available till--'\n\n'Till?'\n\n'Till the end of June.'\n\n'And it is now the end of July.'\n\n'Well, what is a month? He is only too glad to lend the money. He will\nget excellent interest. How on earth have you got into your sage old\nhead this notion of a plot against me? The idea is ridiculous. A plot\nagainst me? What for?'\n\n'Have you ever thought of Bosnia?' asked Aribert coldly.\n\n'What of Bosnia?'\n\n'I need not tell you that the King of Bosnia is naturally under\nobligations to Austria, to whom he owes his crown. Austria is anxious\nfor him to make a good influential marriage.'\n\n'Well, let him.'\n\n'He is going to. He is going to marry the Princess Anna.'\n\n'Not while I live. He made overtures there a year ago, and was\nrebuffed.'\n\n'Yes; but he will make overtures again, and this time he will not be\nrebuffed. Oh, Eugen! can't you see that this plot against you is being\nengineered by some persons who know all about your affairs, and whose\ndesire is to prevent your marriage with Princess Anna? Only one man in\nEurope can have any motive for wishing to prevent your marriage with\nPrincess Anna, and that is the man who means to marry her himself.'\nEugen went very pale.\n\n'Then, Aribert, do you mean to convey to me that my detention in Ostend\nwas contrived by the agents of the King of Bosnia?'\n\n'I do.'\n\n'With a view to stopping my negotiations with Sampson Levi, and so\nputting an end to the possibility of my marriage with Anna?'\n\nAribert nodded.\n\n'You are a good friend to me, Aribert. You mean well. But you are\nmistaken.\n\nYou have been worrying about nothing.'\n\n'Have you forgotten about Reginald Dimmock?'\n\n'I remember you said that he had died.'\n\n'I said nothing of the sort. I said that he had been assassinated. That\nwas part of it, my poor Eugen.'\n\n'Pooh!' said Eugen. 'I don't believe he was assassinated. And as for\nSampson Levi, I will bet you a thousand marks that he and I come to\nterms this morning, and that the million is in my hands before I leave\nLondon.' Aribert shook his head.\n\n'You seem to be pretty sure of Mr Levi's character. Have you had much to\ndo with him before?'\n\n'Well,' Eugen hesitated a second, 'a little. What young man in my\nposition hasn't had something to do with Mr Sampson Levi at one time or\nanother?'\n\n'I haven't,' said Aribert.\n\n'You! You are a fossil.' He rang a silver bell. 'Hans! I will receive Mr\nSampson Levi.'\n\nWhereupon Aribert discreetly departed, and Prince Eugen sat down in the\ngreat velvet chair, and began to look at the papers which Hans had\npreviously placed upon the table.\n\n'Good morning, your Royal Highness,' said Sampson Levi, bowing as he\nentered. 'I trust your Royal Highness is well.'\n\n'Moderately, thanks,' returned the Prince.\n\nIn spite of the fact that he had had as much to do with people of Royal\nblood as any plain man in Europe, Sampson Levi had never yet learned how\nto be at ease with these exalted individuals during the first few\nminutes of an interview. Afterwards, he resumed command of himself and\nhis faculties, but at the beginning he was invariably flustered, scarlet\nof face, and inclined to perspiration.\n\n'We will proceed to business at once,' said Prince Eugen. 'Will you take\na seat, Mr Levi?'\n\n'I thank your Royal Highness.'\n\n'Now as to that loan which we had already practically arranged--a\nmillion, I think it was,' said the Prince airily.\n\n'A million,' Levi acquiesced, toying with his enormous watch chain.\n\n'Everything is now in order. Here are the papers and I should like to\nfinish the matter up at once.'\n\n'Exactly, your Highness, but--'\n\n'But what? You months ago expressed the warmest satisfaction at the\nsecurity, though I am quite prepared to admit that the security, is of\nrather an unusual nature. You also agreed to the rate of interest. It is\nnot everyone, Mr Levi, who can lend out a million at 5-1\/2 per cent. And\nin ten years the whole amount will be paid back. I--er--I believe I\ninformed you that the fortune of Princess Anna, who is about to accept\nmy hand, will ultimately amount to something like fifty millions of\nmarks, which is over two million pounds in your English money.' Prince\nEugen stopped. He had no fancy for talking in this confidential manner\nto financiers, but he felt that circumstances demanded it.\n\n'You see, it's like this, your Royal Highness,' began Mr Sampson Levi,\nin his homely English idiom. 'It's like this. I said I could keep that\nbit of money available till the end of June, and you were to give me an\ninterview here before that date. Not having heard from your Highness,\nand not knowing your Highness's address, though my German agents made\nevery inquiry, I concluded, that you had made other arrangements, money\nbeing so cheap this last few months.'\n\n'I was unfortunately detained at Ostend,' said Prince Eugen, with as\nmuch haughtiness as he could assume, 'by--by important business. I have\nmade no other arrangements, and I shall have need of the million. If you\nwill be so good as to pay it to my London bankers--'\n\n'I'm very sorry,' said Mr Sampson Levi, with a tremendous and dazzling\nair of politeness, which surprised even himself, 'but my syndicate has\nnow lent the money elsewhere. It's in South America--I don't mind\ntelling your Highness that we've lent it to the Chilean Government.'\n\n'Hang the Chilean Government, Mr Levi,' exclaimed the Prince, and he\nwent white. 'I must have that million. It was an arrangement.'\n\n'It was an arrangement, I admit,' said Mr Sampson Levi, 'but your\nHighness broke the arrangement.'\n\nThere was a long silence.\n\n'Do you mean to say,' began the Prince with tense calmness, 'that you\nare not in a position to let me have that million?'\n\n'I could let your Highness have a million in a couple of years' time.'\n\nThe Prince made a gesture of annoyance. 'Mr Levi,' he said, 'if you do\nnot place the money in my hands to-morrow you will ruin one of the\noldest of reigning families, and, incidentally, you will alter the map\nof Europe. You are not keeping faith, and I had relied on you.'\n\n'Pardon me, your Highness,' said little Levi, rising in resentment, 'it\nis not I who have not kept faith. I beg to repeat that the money is no\nlonger at my disposal, and to bid your Highness good morning.'\n\nAnd Mr Sampson Levi left the audience chamber with an awkward, aggrieved\nbow. It was a scene characteristic of the end of the nineteenth century-\n-an overfed, commonplace, pursy little man who had been born in a\nBrixton semi-detached villa, and whose highest idea of pleasure was a\nSunday up the river in an expensive electric launch, confronting and\nutterly routing, in a h\u00c3\u00b4tel belonging to an American millionaire, the\nrepresentative of a race of men who had fingered every page of European\nhistory for centuries, and who still, in their native castles, were\nsurrounded with every outward circumstance of pomp and power.\n\n'Aribert,' said Prince Eugen, a little later, 'you were right. It is all\nover. I have only one refuge--'\n\n'You don't mean--' Aribert stopped, dumbfounded.\n\n'Yes, I do,' he said quickly. 'I can manage it so that it will look like\nan accident.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twenty-One THE RETURN OF F\u00c3\u0089LIX BABYLON\n\nON the evening of Prince Eugen's fateful interview with Mr Sampson Levi,\nTheodore Racksole was wandering somewhat aimlessly and uneasily about\nthe entrance hail and adjacent corridors of the Grand Babylon. He had\nreturned from Ostend only a day or two previously, and had endeavoured\nwith all his might to forget the affair which had carried him there--to\nregard it, in fact, as done with. But he found himself unable to do so.\nIn vain he remarked, under his breath, that there were some things which\nwere best left alone: if his experience as a manipulator of markets, a\ncontriver of gigantic schemes in New York, had taught him anything at\nall, it should surely have taught him that. Yet he could not feel\nreconciled to such a position. The mere presence of the princes in his\nh\u00c3\u00b4tel roused the fighting instincts of this man, who had never in his\nwhole career been beaten. He had, as it were, taken up arms on their\nside, and if the princes of Posen would not continue their own battle,\nnevertheless he, Theodore Racksole, wanted to continue it for them. To a\ncertain extent, of course, the battle had been won, for Prince Eugen had\nbeen rescued from an extremely difficult and dangerous position, and the\nenemy--consisting of Jules, Rocco, Miss Spencer, and perhaps others--had\nbeen put to flight. But that, he conceived, was not enough; it was very\nfar from being enough. That the criminals, for criminals they decidedly\nwere, should still be at large, he regarded as an absurd anomaly. And\nthere was another point: he had said nothing to the police of all that\nhad occurred. He disdained the police, but he could scarcely fail to\nperceive that if the police should by accident gain a clue to the real\nstate of the case he might be placed rather awkwardly, for the simple\nreason that in the eyes of the law it amounted to a misdemeanour to\nconceal as much as he had concealed. He asked himself, for the\nthousandth time, why he had adopted a policy of concealment from the\npolice, why he had become in any way interested in the Posen matter, and\nwhy, at this present moment, he should be so anxious to prosecute it\nfurther? To the first two questions he replied, rather lamely, that he\nhad been influenced by Nella, and also by a natural spirit of adventure;\nto the third he replied that he had always been in the habit of carrying\nthings through, and was now actuated by a mere childish, obstinate\ndesire to carry this one through. Moreover, he was splendidly conscious\nof his perfect ability to carry it through. One additional impulse he\nhad, though he did not admit it to himself, being by nature adverse to\nbig words, and that was an abstract love of justice, the Anglo-Saxon's\ndeep-found instinct for helping the right side to conquer, even when\ngrave risks must thereby be run, with no corresponding advantage.\n\nHe was turning these things over in his mind as he walked about the vast\nh\u00c3\u00b4tel on that evening of the last day in July. The Society papers had\nbeen stating for a week past that London was empty, but, in spite of the\nSociety papers, London persisted in seeming to be just as full as ever.\nThe Grand Babylon was certainly not as crowded as it had been a month\nearlier, but it was doing a very passable business. At the close of the\nseason the gay butterflies of the social community have a habit of\nhovering for a day or two in the big h\u00c3\u00b4tels before they flutter away to\ncastle and country-house, meadow and moor, lake and stream. The great\nbasket-chairs in the portico were well filled by old and middle-aged\ngentlemen engaged in enjoying the varied delights of liqueurs, cigars,\nand the full moon which floated so serenely above the Thames. Here and\nthere a pretty woman on the arm of a cavalier in immaculate attire swept\nher train as she turned to and fro in the promenade of the terrace.\nWaiters and uniformed commissionaires and gold-braided doorkeepers moved\nnoiselessly about; at short intervals the chief of the doorkeepers blew\nhis shrill whistle and hansoms drove up with tinkling bell to take away\na pair of butterflies to some place of amusement or boredom;\noccasionally a private carriage drawn by expensive and self-conscious\nhorses put the hansoms to shame by its mere outward glory. It was a hot\nnight, a night for the summer woods, and save for the vehicles there was\nno rapid movement of any kind. It seemed as though the world--the world,\nthat is to say, of the Grand Babylon--was fully engaged in the solemn\nprocesses of digestion and small-talk. Even the long row of the\nEmbankment gas-lamps, stretching right and left, scarcely trembled in\nthe still, warm, caressing air. The stars overhead looked down with many\nblinkings upon the enormous pile of the Grand Babylon, and the moon\nregarded it with bland and changeless face; what they thought of it and\nits inhabitants cannot, unfortunately, be recorded. What Theodore\nRacksole thought of the moon can be recorded: he thought it was a\nnuisance. It somehow fascinated his gaze with its silly stare, and so\ninterfered with his complex meditations. He glanced round at the well-\ndressed and satisfied people--his guests, his customers. They appeared\nto ignore him absolutely.\n\nProbably only a very small percentage of them had the least idea that\nthis tall spare man, with the iron-grey hair and the thin, firm,\nresolute face, who wore his American-cut evening clothes with such\ncareless ease, was the sole proprietor of the Grand Babylon, and\npossibly the richest man in Europe. As has already been stated, Racksole\nwas not a celebrity in England.\n\nThe guests of the Grand Babylon saw merely a restless male person, whose\nrestlessness was rather a disturber of their quietude, but with whom, to\njudge by his countenance, it would be inadvisable to remonstrate.\nTherefore Theodore Racksole continued his perambulations unchallenged,\nand kept saying to himself, 'I must do something.' But what? He could\nthink of no course to pursue.\n\nAt last he walked straight through the h\u00c3\u00b4tel and out at the other\nentrance, and so up the little unassuming side street into the roaring\ntorrent of the narrow and crowded Strand. He jumped on a Putney bus, and\npaid his fair to Putney, fivepence, and then, finding that the humble\noccupants of the vehicle stared at the spectacle of a man in evening\ndress but without a dustcoat, he jumped off again, oblivious of the fact\nthat the conductor jerked a thumb towards him and winked at the\npassengers as who should say, 'There goes a lunatic.' He went into a\ntobacconist's shop and asked for a cigar. The shopman mildly inquired\nwhat price.\n\n'What are the best you've got?' asked Theodore Racksole.\n\n'Five shillings each, sir,' said the man promptly.\n\n'Give me a penny one,' was Theodore Racksole's laconic request, and he\nwalked out of the shop smoking the penny cigar. It was a new sensation\nfor him.\n\nHe was inhaling the aromatic odours of Eug\u00c3\u00a8ne Rimmel's establishment for\nthe sale of scents when a gentleman, walking slowly in the opposite\ndirection, accosted him with a quiet, 'Good evening, Mr Racksole.' The\nmillionaire did not at first recognize his interlocutor, who wore a\ntravelling overcoat, and was carrying a handbag. Then a slight, pleased\nsmile passed over his features, and he held out his hand.\n\n'Well, Mr Babylon,' he greeted the other, 'of all persons in the wide\nworld you are the man I would most have wished to meet.'\n\n'You flatter me,' said the little Anglicized Swiss.\n\n'No, I don't,' answered Racksole; 'it isn't my custom, any more than\nit's yours. I wanted to have a real good long yarn with you, and lo!\nhere you are! Where have you sprung from?'\n\n'From Lausanne,' said Felix Babylon. 'I had finished my duties there, I\nhad nothing else to do, and I felt homesick. I felt the nostalgia of\nLondon, and so I came over, just as you see,' and he raised the handbag\nfor Racksole's notice. 'One toothbrush, one razor, two slippers, eh?' He\nlaughed. 'I was wondering as I walked along where I should stay--me,\nFelix Babylon, homeless in London.'\n\n'I should advise you to stay at the Grand Babylon,' Racksole laughed\nback.\n\n'It is a good h\u00c3\u00b4tel, and I know the proprietor personally.'\n\n'Rather expensive, is it not?' said Babylon.\n\n'To you, sir,' answered Racksole, 'the inclusive terms will be exactly\nhalf a crown a week. Do you accept?'\n\n'I accept,' said Babylon, and added, 'You are very good, Mr Racksole.'\n\nThey strolled together back to the h\u00c3\u00b4tel, saying nothing in particular,\nbut feeling very content with each other's company.\n\n'Many customers?' asked Felix Babylon.\n\n'Very tolerable,' said Racksole, assuming as much of the air of the\nprofessional h\u00c3\u00b4tel proprietor as he could. 'I think I may say in the\nstorekeeper's phrase, that if there is any business about I am doing it.\n\nTo-night the people are all on the terrace in the portico--it's so\nconfoundedly hot--and the consumption of ice is simply enormous--nearly\nas large as it would be in New York.'\n\n'In that case,' said Babylon politely, 'let me offer you another cigar.'\n\n'But I have not finished this one.'\n\n'That is just why I wish to offer you another one. A cigar such as\nyours, my good friend, ought never to be smoked within the precincts of\nthe Grand Babylon, not even by the proprietor of the Grand Babylon, and\nespecially when all the guests are assembled in the portico. The fumes\nof it would ruin any h\u00c3\u00b4tel.'\n\nTheodore Racksole laughingly lighted the Rothschild Havana which Babylon\ngave him, and they entered the h\u00c3\u00b4tel arm in arm. But no sooner had they\nmounted the steps than little Felix became the object of numberless\ngreetings. It appeared that he had been highly popular among his quondam\nguests. At last they reached the managerial room, where Babylon was\nregaled on a chicken, and Racksole assisted him in the consumption of a\nbottle of Heidsieck Monopole, Carte d'Or.\n\n'This chicken is almost perfectly grilled,' said Babylon at length. 'It\nis a credit to the house. But why, my dear Racksole, why in the name of\nHeaven did you quarrel with Rocco?'\n\n'Then you have heard?'\n\n'Heard! My dear friend, it was in every newspaper on the Continent. Some\njournals prophesied that the Grand Babylon would have to close its doors\nwithin half a year now that Rocco had deserted it. But of course I knew\nbetter. I knew that you must have a good reason for allowing Rocco to\ndepart, and that you must have made arrangements in advance for a\nsubstitute.'\n\n'As a matter of fact, I had not made arrangements in advance,' said\nTheodore Racksole, a little ruefully; 'but happily we have found in our\nsecond sous-chef an artist inferior only to Rocco himself. That,\nhowever, was mere good fortune.'\n\n'Surely,' said Babylon, 'it was indiscreet to trust to mere good fortune\nin such a serious matter?'\n\n'I didn't trust to mere good fortune. I didn't trust to anything except\nRocco, and he deceived me.'\n\n'But why did you quarrel with him?'\n\n'I didn't quarrel with him. I found him embalming a corpse in the State\nbedroom one night--'\n\n'You what?' Babylon almost screamed.\n\n'I found him embalming a corpse in the State bedroom,' repeated Racksole\nin his quietest tones.\n\nThe two men gazed at each other, and then Racksole replenished Babylon's\nglass.\n\n'Tell me,' said Babylon, settling himself deep in an easy chair and\nlighting a cigar.\n\nAnd Racksole thereupon recounted to him the whole of the Posen episode,\nwith every circumstantial detail so far as he knew it. It was a long and\ncomplicated recital, and occupied about an hour. During that time little\nFelix never spoke a word, scarcely moved a muscle; only his small eyes\ngazed through the bluish haze of smoke. The clock on the mantelpiece\ntinkled midnight.\n\n'Time for whisky and soda,' said Racksole, and got up as if to ring the\nbell; but Babylon waved him back.\n\n'You have told me that this Sampson Levi had an audience of Prince Eugen\nto-day, but you have not told me the result of that audience,' said\nBabylon.\n\n'Because I do not yet know it. But I shall doubtless know to-morrow. In\nthe meantime, I feel fairly sure that Levi declined to produce Prince\nEugen's required million. I have reason to believe that the money was\nlent elsewhere.'\n\n'H'm!' mused Babylon; and then, carelessly, 'I am not at all surprised\nat that arrangement for spying through the bathroom of the State\napartments.'\n\n'Why are you not surprised?'\n\n'Oh!' said Babylon, 'it is such an obvious dodge--so easy to carry out.\nAs for me, I took special care never to involve myself in these affairs.\nI knew they existed; I somehow felt that they existed. But I also felt\nthat they lay outside my sphere. My business was to provide board and\nlodging of the most sumptuous kind to those who didn't mind paying for\nit; and I did my business. If anything else went on in the h\u00c3\u00b4tel, under\nthe rose, I long determined to ignore it unless it should happen to be\nbrought before my notice; and it never was brought before my notice.\nHowever, I admit that there is a certain pleasurable excitement in this\nkind of affair and doubtless you have experienced that.'\n\n'I have,' said Racksole simply, 'though I believe you are laughing at\nme.'\n\n'By no means,' Babylon replied. 'Now what, if I may ask the question, is\ngoing to be your next step?'\n\n'That is just what I desire to know myself,' said Theodore Racksole.\n\n'Well,' said Babylon, after a pause, 'let us begin. In the first place,\nit is possible you may be interested to hear that I happened to see\nJules to-day.'\n\n'You did!' Racksole remarked with much calmness. 'Where?'\n\n'Well, it was early this morning, in Paris, just before I left there.\nThe meeting was quite accidental, and Jules seemed rather surprised at\nmeeting me. He respectfully inquired where I was going, and I said that\nI was going to Switzerland. At that moment I thought I was going to\nSwitzerland. It had occurred to me that after all I should be happier\nthere, and that I had better turn back and not see London any more.\nHowever, I changed my mind once again, and decided to come on to London,\nand accept the risks of being miserable there without my h\u00c3\u00b4tel. Then I\nasked Jules whither he was bound, and he told me that he was off to\nConstantinople, being interested in a new French h\u00c3\u00b4tel there. I wished\nhim good luck, and we parted.'\n\n'Constantinople, eh!' said Racksole. 'A highly suitable place for him, I\nshould say.'\n\n'But,' Babylon resumed, 'I caught sight of him again.'\n\n'Where?'\n\n'At Charing Cross, a few minutes before I had the pleasure of meeting\nyou.\n\nMr Jules had not gone to Constantinople after all. He did not see me, or\nI should have suggested to him that in going from Paris to\nConstantinople it is not usual to travel via London.'\n\n'The cheek of the fellow!' exclaimed Theodore Racksole. 'The gorgeous\nand colossal cheek of the fellow!'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twenty-Two IN THE WINE CELLARS OF THE GRAND BABYLON\n\n'DO you know anything of the antecedents of this Jules,' asked Theodore\nRacksole, helping himself to whisky.\n\n'Nothing whatever,' said Babylon. 'Until you told me, I don't think I\nwas aware that his true name was Thomas Jackson, though of course I knew\nthat it was not Jules. I certainly was not aware that Miss Spencer was\nhis wife, but I had long suspected that their relations were somewhat\nmore intimate than the nature of their respective duties in the h\u00c3\u00b4tel\nabsolutely demanded. All that I do know of Jules--he will always be\ncalled Jules--is that he gradually, by some mysterious personal force,\nacquired a prominent position in the h\u00c3\u00b4tel. Decidedly he was the\ncleverest and most intellectual waiter I have ever known, and he was\nspecially skilled in the difficult task of retaining his own dignity\nwhile not interfering with that of other people.\n\nI'm afraid this information is a little too vague to be of any practical\nassistance in the present difficulty.'\n\n'What is the present difficulty?' Racksole queried, with a simple air.\n\n'I should imagine that the present difficulty is to account for the\nman's presence in London.'\n\n'That is easily accounted for,' said Racksole.\n\n'How? Do you suppose he is anxious to give himself up to justice, or\nthat the chains of habit bind him to the h\u00c3\u00b4tel?'\n\n'Neither,' said Racksole. 'Jules is going to have another try--that's\nall.'\n\n'Another try at what?'\n\n'At Prince Eugen. Either at his life or his liberty. Most probably the\nformer this time; almost certainly the former. He has guessed that we\nare somewhat handicapped by our anxiety to keep Prince Eugen's\npredicament quite quiet, and he is taking advantage, of that fact. As he\nalready is fairly rich, on his own admission, the reward which has been\noffered to him must be enormous, and he is absolutely determined to get\nit. He has several times recently proved himself to be a daring fellow;\nunless I am mistaken he will shortly prove himself to be still more\ndaring.'\n\n'But what can he do? Surely you don't suggest that he will attempt the\nlife of Prince Eugen in this h\u00c3\u00b4tel?'\n\n'Why not? If Reginald Dimmock fell on mere suspicion that he would turn\nout unfaithful to the conspiracy, why not Prince Eugen?'\n\n'But it would be an unspeakable crime, and do infinite harm to the\nh\u00c3\u00b4tel!'\n\n'True!' Racksole admitted, smiling. Little Felix Babylon seemed to brace\nhimself for the grasping of his monstrous idea.\n\n'How could it possibly be done?' he asked at length.\n\n'Dimmock was poisoned.'\n\n'Yes, but you had Rocco here then, and Rocco was in the plot. It is\nconceivable that Rocco could have managed it--barely conceivable. But\nwithout Rocco I cannot think it possible. I cannot even think that Jules\nwould attempt it. You see, in a place like the Grand Babylon, as\nprobably I needn't point out to you, food has to pass through so many\nhands that to poison one person without killing perhaps fifty would be a\nmost delicate operation. Moreover, Prince Eugen, unless he has changed\nhis habits, is always served by his own attendant, old Hans, and\ntherefore any attempt to tamper with a cooked dish immediately before\nserving would be hazardous in the extreme.'\n\n'Granted,' said Racksole. 'The wine, however, might be more easily got\nat.\n\nHad you thought of that?'\n\n'I had not,' Babylon admitted. 'You are an ingenious theorist, but I\nhappen to know that Prince Eugen always has his wine opened in his own\npresence. No doubt it would be opened by Hans. Therefore the wine theory\nis not tenable, my friend.'\n\n'I do not see why,' said Racksole. 'I know nothing of wine as an expert,\nand I very seldom drink it, but it seems to me that a bottle of wine\nmight be tampered with while it was still in the cellar, especially if\nthere was an accomplice in the h\u00c3\u00b4tel.'\n\n'You think, then, that you are not yet rid of all your conspirators?'\n\n'I think that Jules might still have an accomplice within the building.'\n\n'And that a bottle of wine could be opened and recorked without leaving\nany trace of the operation?' Babylon was a trifle sarcastic.\n\n'I don't see the necessity of opening the bottle in order to poison the\nwine,' said Racksole. 'I have never tried to poison anybody by means of\na bottle of wine, and I don't lay claim to any natural talent as a\npoisoner, but I think I could devise several ways of managing the trick.\nOf course, I admit I may be entirely mistaken as to Jules' intentions.'\n\n'Ah!' said Felix Babylon. 'The wine cellars beneath us are one of the\nwonders of London. I hope you are aware, Mr Racksole, that when you\nbought the Grand Babylon you bought what is probably the finest stock of\nwines in England, if not in Europe. In the valuation I reckoned them at\nsixty thousand pounds. And I may say that I always took care that the\ncellars were properly guarded. Even Jules would experience a serious\ndifficulty in breaking into the cellars without the connivance of the\nwine-clerk, and the wine-clerk is, or was, incorruptible.'\n\n'I am ashamed to say that I have not yet inspected my wines,' smiled\nRacksole; 'I have never given them a thought. Once or twice I have taken\nthe trouble to make a tour of the h\u00c3\u00b4tel, but I omitted the cellars in my\nexcursions.'\n\n'Impossible, my dear fellow!' said Babylon, amused at such a confession,\nto him--a great connoisseur and lover of fine wines--almost incredible.\n'But really you must see them to-morrow. If I may, I will accompany\nyou.'\n\n'Why not to-night?' Racksole suggested, calmly.\n\n'To-night! It is very late: Hubbard will have gone to bed.'\n\n'And may I ask who is Hubbard? I remember the name but dimly.'\n\n'Hubbard is the wine-clerk of the Grand Babylon,' said Felix, with a\ncertain emphasis. 'A sedate man of forty. He has the keys of the\ncellars. He knows every bottle of every bin, its date, its qualities,\nits value. And he's a teetotaler. Hubbard is a curiosity. No wine can\nleave the cellars without his knowledge, and no person can enter the\ncellars without his knowledge. At least, that is how it was in my time,'\nBabylon added.\n\n'We will wake him,' said Racksole.\n\n'But it is one o'clock in the morning,' Babylon protested.\n\n'Never mind--that is, if you consent to accompany me. A cellar is the\nsame by night as by day. Therefore, why not now?'\n\nBabylon shrugged his shoulders. 'As you wish,' he agreed, with his\nindestructible politeness.\n\n'And now to find this Mr Hubbard, with his key of the cupboard,' said\nRacksole, as they walked out of the room together. Although the hour was\nso late, the h\u00c3\u00b4tel was not, of course, closed for the night. A few\nguests still remained about in the public rooms, and a few fatigued\nwaiters were still in attendance. One of these latter was despatched in\nsearch of the singular Mr Hubbard, and it fortunately turned out that\nthis gentleman had not actually retired, though he was on the point of\ndoing so. He brought the keys to Mr Racksole in person, and after he had\nhad a little chat with his former master, the proprietor and the ex-\nproprietor of the Grand Babylon H\u00c3\u00b4tel proceeded on their way to the\ncellars.\n\nThese cellars extend over, or rather under, quite half the superficial\nareas of the whole h\u00c3\u00b4tel--the longitudinal half which lies next to the\nStrand.\n\nOwing to the fact that the ground slopes sharply from the Strand to the\nriver, the Grand Babylon is, so to speak, deeper near the Strand than it\nis near the Thames. Towards the Thames there is, below the entrance\nlevel, a basement and a sub-basement. Towards the Strand there is\nbasement, sub-basement, and the huge wine cellars beneath all. After\ndescending the four flights of the service stairs, and traversing a long\npassage running parallel with the kitchen, the two found themselves\nopposite a door, which, on being unlocked, gave access to another flight\nof stairs. At the foot of this was the main entrance to the cellars.\nOutside the entrance was the wine-lift, for the ascension of delicious\nfluids to the upper floors, and, opposite, Mr Hubbard's little office.\nThere was electric light everywhere.\n\nBabylon, who, as being most accustomed to them, held the bunch of keys,\nopened the great door, and then they were in the first cellar--the first\nof a suite of five. Racksole was struck not only by the icy coolness of\nthe place, but also by its vastness. Babylon had seized a portable\nelectric handlight, attached to a long wire, which lay handy, and,\nwaving it about, disclosed the dimensions of the place. By that flashing\nillumination the subterranean chamber looked unutterably weird and\nmysterious, with its rows of numbered bins, stretching away into the\ndistance till the radiance was reduced to the occasional far gleam of\nthe light on the shoulder of a bottle. Then Babylon switched on the\nfixed electric lights, and Theodore Racksole entered upon a personally-\nconducted tour of what was quite the most interesting part of his own\nproperty.\n\nTo see the innocent enthusiasm of Felix Babylon for these stores of\nexhilarating liquid was what is called in the North 'a sight for sair\neen'.\n\nHe displayed to Racksole's bewildered gaze, in their due order, all the\nwines of three continents--nay, of four, for the superb and luscious\nConstantia wine of Cape Colony was not wanting in that most catholic\ncollection of vintages. Beginning with the unsurpassed products of\nBurgundy, he continued with the clarets of M\u00c3\u00a9doc, Bordeaux, and\nSauterne; then to the champagnes of Ay, Hautvilliers, and Pierry; then\nto the hocks and moselles of Germany, and the brilliant imitation\nchampagnes of Main, Neckar, and Naumburg; then to the famous and\nadorable Tokay of Hungary, and all the Austrian varieties of French\nwines, including Carlowitz and Somlauer; then to the dry sherries of\nSpain, including purest Manzanilla, and Amontillado, and Vino de Pasto;\nthen to the wines of Malaga, both sweet and dry, and all the 'Spanish\nreds' from Catalonia, including the dark 'Tent' so often used\nsacramentally; then to the renowned port of Oporto. Then he proceeded to\nthe Italian cellar, and descanted upon the excellence of Barolo from\nPiedmont, of Chianti from Tuscany, of Orvieto from the Roman States, of\nthe 'Tears of Christ' from Naples, and the commoner Marsala from Sicily.\nAnd so on, to an extent and with a fullness of detail which cannot be\nrendered here.\n\nAt the end of the suite of cellars there was a glazed door, which, as\ncould be seen, gave access to a supplemental and smaller cellar, an\napartment about fifteen or sixteen feet square.\n\n'Anything special in there?' asked Racksole curiously, as they stood\nbefore the door, and looked within at the seined ends of bottles.\n\n'Ah!' exclaimed Babylon, almost smacking his lips, 'therein lies the\ncream of all.'\n\n'The best champagne, I suppose?' said Racksole.\n\n'Yes,' said Babylon, 'the best champagne is there--a very special\nSillery, as exquisite as you will find anywhere. But I see, my friend,\nthat you fall into the common error of putting champagne first among\nwines. That distinction belongs to Burgundy. You have old Burgundy in\nthat cellar, Mr Racksole, which cost me--how much do you think?--eighty\npounds a bottle.\n\nProbably it will never be drunk,' he added with a sigh. 'It is too\nexpensive even for princes and plutocrats.'\n\n'Yes, it will,' said Racksole quickly. 'You and I will have a bottle up\nto-morrow.'\n\n'Then,' continued Babylon, still riding his hobby-horse, 'there is a\nsample of the Rhine wine dated 1706 which caused such a sensation at the\nVienna Exhibition of 1873. There is also a singularly glorious Persian\nwine from Shiraz, the like of which I have never seen elsewhere. Also\nthere is an unrivalled vintage of Roman\u00c3\u00a9e-Conti, greatest of all modern\nBurgundies. If I remember right Prince Eugen invariably has a bottle\nwhen he comes to stay here. It is not on the h\u00c3\u00b4tel wine list, of course,\nand only a few customers know of it. We do not precisely hawk it about\nthe dining-room.'\n\n'Indeed!' said Racksole. 'Let us go inside.'\n\nThey entered the stone apartment, rendered almost sacred by the\npreciousness of its contents, and Racksole looked round with a strangely\nintent and curious air. At the far side was a grating, through which\ncame a feeble light.\n\n'What is that?' asked the millionaire sharply.\n\n'That is merely a ventilation grating. Good ventilation is absolutely\nessential.'\n\n'Looks broken, doesn't it?' Racksole suggested and then, putting a\nfinger quickly on Babylon's shoulder, 'there's someone in the cellar.\nCan't you hear breathing, down there, behind that bin?'\n\nThe two men stood tense and silent for a while, listening, under the ray\nof the single electric light in the ceiling. Half the cellar was\ninvolved in gloom. At length Racksole walked firmly down the central\npassage-way between the bins and turned to the corner at the right.\n\n'Come out, you villain!' he said in a low, well-nigh vicious tone, and\ndragged up a cowering figure.\n\nHe had expected to find a man, but it was his own daughter, Nella\nRacksole, upon whom he had laid angry hands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twenty-Three FURTHER EVENTS IN THE CELLAR\n\n'WELL, Father,' Nella greeted her astounded parent. 'You should make\nsure that you have got hold of the right person before you use all that\nterrible muscular force of yours. I do believe you have broken my\nshoulder bone.' She rubbed her shoulder with a comical expression of\npain, and then stood up before the two men. The skirt of her dark grey\ndress was torn and dirty, and the usually trim Nella looked as though\nshe had been shot down a canvas fire-escape. Mechanically she smoothed\nher frock, and gave a straightening touch to her hair.\n\n'Good evening, Miss Racksole,' said Felix Babylon, bowing formally.\n'This is an unexpected pleasure.' Felix's drawing-room manners never\ndeserted him upon any occasion whatever.\n\n'May I inquire what you are doing in my wine cellar, Nella Racksole?'\nsaid the millionaire a little stiffly He was certainly somewhat annoyed\nat having mistaken his daughter for a criminal; moreover, he hated to be\nsurprised, and upon this occasion he had been surprised beyond any\nordinary surprise; lastly, he was not at all pleased that Nella should\nbe observed in that strange predicament by a stranger.\n\n'I will tell you,' said Nella. 'I had been reading rather late in my\nroom--the night was so close. I heard Big Ben strike half-past twelve,\nand then I put the book down, and went out on to the balcony of my\nwindow for a little fresh air before going to bed. I leaned over the\nbalcony very quietly--you will remember that I am on the third floor\nnow--and looked down below into the little sunk yard which separates the\nwall of the h\u00c3\u00b4tel from Salisbury Lane. I was rather astonished to see a\nfigure creeping across the yard. I knew there was no entrance into the\nh\u00c3\u00b4tel from that yard, and besides, it is fifteen or twenty feet below\nthe level of the street. So I watched. The figure went close up against\nthe wall, and disappeared from my view. I leaned over the balcony as far\nas I dared, but I couldn't see him. I could hear him, however.'\n\n'What could you hear?' questioned Racksole sharply.\n\n'It sounded like a sawing noise,' said Nella; 'and it went on for quite\na long time--nearly a quarter of an hour, I should think--a rasping sort\nof noise.'\n\n'Why on earth didn't you come and warn me or someone else in the h\u00c3\u00b4tel?'\nasked Racksole.\n\n'Oh, I don't know, Dad,' she replied sweetly. 'I had got interested in\nit, and I thought I would see it out myself. Well, as I was saying, Mr.\nBabylon,' she continued, addressing her remarks to Felix, with a\ndazzling smile, 'that noise went on for quite a long time. At last it\nstopped, and the figure reappeared from under the wall, crossed the\nyard, climbed up the opposite wall by some means or other, and so over\nthe railings into Salisbury Lane. I felt rather relieved then, because I\nknew he hadn't actually broken into the h\u00c3\u00b4tel. He walked down Salisbury\nLane very slowly. A policeman was just coming up. \"Goodnight, officer,\"\nI heard him say to the policeman, and he asked him for a match. The\npoliceman supplied the match, and the other man lighted a cigarette, and\nproceeded further down the lane. By cricking your neck from my window,\nMr Babylon, you can get a glimpse of the Embankment and the river. I saw\nthe man cross the Embankment, and lean over the river wall, where he\nseemed to be talking to some one. He then walked along the Embankment to\nWestminster and that was the last I saw of him. I waited a minute or two\nfor him to come back, but he didn't come back, and so I thought it was\nabout time I began to make inquiries into the affair. I went downstairs\ninstantly, and out of the h\u00c3\u00b4tel, through the quadrangle, into Salisbury\nLane, and I looked over those railings. There was a ladder on the other\nside, by which it was perfectly easy--once you had got over the\nrailings--to climb down into the yard. I was horribly afraid lest\nsomeone might walk up Salisbury Lane and catch me in the act of\nnegotiating those railings, but no one did, and I surmounted them, with\nno worse damage than a torn skirt. I crossed the yard on tiptoe, and I\nfound that in the wall, close to the ground and almost exactly under my\nwindow, there was an iron grating, about one foot by fourteen inches. I\nsuspected, as there was no other ironwork near, that the mysterious\nvisitor must have been sawing at this grating for private purposes of\nhis own. I gave it a good shake, and I was not at all surprised that a\ngood part of it came off in my hand, leaving just enough room for a\nperson to creep through. I decided that I would creep through, and now\nwish I hadn't. I don't know, Mr Babylon, whether you have ever tried to\ncreep through a small hole with a skirt on. Have you?'\n\n'I have not had that pleasure,' said little Felix, bowing again, and\nabsently taking up a bottle which lay to his hand.\n\n'Well, you are fortunate,' the imperturbable Nella resumed. 'For quite\nthree minutes I thought I should perish in that grating, Dad, with my\nshoulder inside and the rest of me outside. However, at last, by the\nmost amazing and agonizing efforts, I pulled myself through and fell\ninto this extraordinary cellar more dead than alive. Then I wondered\nwhat I should do next. Should I wait for the mysterious visitor to\nreturn, and stab him with my pocket scissors if he tried to enter, or\nshould I raise an alarm? First of all I replaced the broken grating,\nthen I struck a match, and I saw that I had got landed in a wilderness\nof bottles. The match went out, and I hadn't another one. So I sat down\nin the corner to think. I had just decided to wait and see if the\nvisitor returned, when I heard footsteps, and then voices; and then you\ncame in. I must say I was rather taken aback, especially as I recognized\nthe voice of Mr Babylon. You see, I didn't want to frighten you.\n\nIf I had bobbed up from behind the bottles and said \"Booh!\" you would\nhave had a serious shock. I wanted to think of a way of breaking my\npresence gently to you. But you saved me the trouble, Dad. Was I really\nbreathing so loudly that you could hear me?'\n\nThe girl ended her strange recital, and there was a moment's silence in\nthe cellar. Racksole merely nodded an affirmative to her concluding\nquestion.\n\n'Well, Nell, my girl,' said the millionaire at length, 'we are much\nobliged for your gymnastic efforts--very much obliged. But now, I think\nyou had better go off to bed. There is going to be some serious trouble\nhere, I'll lay my last dollar on that?'\n\n'But if there is to be a burglary I should so like to see it, Dad,'\nNella pleaded. 'I've never seen a burglar caught red-handed.'\n\n'This isn't a burglary, my dear. I calculate it's something far worse\nthan a burglary.'\n\n'What?' she cried. 'Murder? Arson? Dynamite plot? How perfectly\nsplendid!'\n\n'Mr Babylon informs me that Jules is in London,' said Racksole quietly.\n\n'Jules!' she exclaimed under her breath, and her tone changed instantly\nto the utmost seriousness. 'Switch off the light, quick!' Springing to\nthe switch, she put the cellar in darkness.\n\n'What's that for?' said her father.\n\n'If he comes back he would see the light, and be frightened away,' said\nNella. 'That wouldn't do at all.'\n\n'It wouldn't, Miss Racksole,' said Babylon, and there was in his voice a\nnote of admiration for the girl's sagacity which Racksole heard with\nhigh paternal pride.\n\n'Listen, Nella,' said the latter, drawing his daughter to him in the\nprofound gloom of the cellar. 'We fancy that Jules may be trying to\ntamper with a certain bottle of wine--a bottle which might possibly be\ndrunk by Prince Eugen. Now do you think that the man you saw might have\nbeen Jules?'\n\n'I hadn't previously thought of him as being Jules, but immediately you\nmentioned the name I somehow knew that he was. Yes, I am sure it was\nJules.'\n\n'Well, just hear what I have to say. There is no time to lose. If he is\ncoming at all he will be here very soon--and you can help.' Racksole\nexplained what he thought Jules' tactics might be. He proposed that if\nthe man returned he should not be interfered with, but merely watched\nfrom the other side of the glass door.\n\n'You want, as it were, to catch Mr Jules alive?' said Babylon, who\nseemed rather taken aback at this novel method of dealing with\ncriminals. 'Surely,' he added, 'it would be simpler and easier to inform\nthe police of your suspicion, and to leave everything to them.'\n\n'My dear fellow,' said Racksole, 'we have already gone much too far\nwithout the police to make it advisable for us to call them in at this\nsomewhat advanced stage of the proceedings. Besides, if you must know\nit, I have a particular desire to capture the scoundrel myself. I will\nleave you and Nella here, since Nella insists on seeing everything, and\nI will arrange things so that once he has entered the cellar Jules will\nnot get out of it again--at any rate through the grating. You had better\nplace yourselves on the other side of the glass door, in the big cellar;\nyou will be in a position to observe from there, I will skip off at\nonce. All you have to do is to take note of what the fellow does. If he\nhas any accomplices within the h\u00c3\u00b4tel we shall probably be able by that\nmeans to discover who the accomplice is.'\n\nLighting a match and shading it with his hands, Racksole showed them\nboth out of the little cellar. 'Now if you lock this glass door on the\noutside he can't escape this way: the panes of glass are too small, and\nthe woodwork too stout. So, if he comes into the trap, you two will have\nthe pleasure of actually seeing him frantically writhe therein, without\nany personal danger; but perhaps you'd better not show yourselves.'\n\nIn another moment Felix Babylon and Nella were left to themselves in the\ndarkness of the cellar, listening to the receding footfalls of Theodore\nRacksole. But the sound of these footfalls had not died away before\nanother sound greeted their ears--the grating of the small cellar was\nbeing removed.\n\n'I hope your father will be in time,' whispered Felix\n\n'Hush!' the girl warned him, and they stooped side by side in tense\nsilence.\n\nA man cautiously but very neatly wormed his body through the aperture of\nthe grating. The watchers could only see his form indistinctly in the\ndarkness.\n\nThen, being fairly within the cellar, he walked without the least\nhesitation to the electric switch and turned on the light. It was\nunmistakably Jules, and he knew the geography of the cellar very well.\nBabylon could with difficulty repress a start as he saw this bold and\nunscrupulous ex-waiter moving with such an air of assurance and\ndetermination about the precious cellar. Jules went directly to a small\nbin which was numbered 17, and took there from the topmost bottle.\n\n'The Romanee-Conti--Prince Eugen's wine!' Babylon exclaimed under his\nbreath.\n\nJules neatly and quickly removed the seal with an instrument which he\nhad clearly brought for the purpose. He then took a little flat box from\nhis pocket, which seemed to contain a sort of black salve. Rubbing his\nfinger in this, he smeared the top of the neck of the bottle with it,\njust where the cork came against the glass. In another instant he had\ndeftly replaced the seal and restored the bottle to its position. He\nthen turned off the light, and made for the aperture. When he was half-\nway through Nella exclaimed, 'He will escape, after all. Dad has not had\ntime--we must stop him.'\n\nBut Babylon, that embodiment of caution, forcibly, but nevertheless\npolitely, restrained this Yankee girl, whom he deemed so rash and\nimprudent, and before she could free herself the lithe form of Jules had\ndisappeared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twenty-Four THE BOTTLE OF WINE\n\nAS regards Theodore Racksole, who was to have caught his man from the\noutside of the cellar, he made his way as rapidly as possible from the\nwine-cellars, up to the ground floor, out of the h\u00c3\u00b4tel by the\nquadrangle, through the quadrangle, and out into the top of Salisbury\nLane. Now, owing to the vastness of the structure of the Grand Babylon,\nthe mere distance thus to be traversed amounted to a little short of a\nquarter of a mile, and, as it included a number of stairs, about two\ndozen turnings, and several passages which at that time of night were in\ndarkness more or less complete, Racksole could not have been expected to\naccomplish the journey in less than five minutes. As a matter of fact,\nsix minutes had elapsed before he reached the top of Salisbury Lane,\nbecause he had been delayed nearly a minute by some questions addressed\nto him by a muddled and whisky-laden guest who had got lost in the\ncorridors. As everybody knows, there is a sharp short bend in Salisbury\nLane near the top. Racksole ran round this at good racing speed, but he\nwas unfortunate enough to run straight up against the very policeman who\nhad not long before so courteously supplied Jules with a match. The\npoliceman seemed to be scarcely in so pliant a mood just then.\n\n'Hullo!' he said, his naturally suspicious nature being doubtless\naroused by the spectacle of a bareheaded man in evening dress running\nviolently down the lane. 'What's this? Where are you for in such a\nhurry?' and he forcibly detained Theodore Racksole for a moment and\nscrutinized his face.\n\n'Now, officer,' said Racksole quietly, 'none of your larks, if you\nplease.\n\nI've no time to lose.'\n\n'Beg your pardon, sir,' the policeman remarked, though hesitatingly and\nnot quite with good temper, and Racksole was allowed to proceed on his\nway. The millionaire's scheme for trapping Jules was to get down into\nthe little sunk yard by means of the ladder, and then to secrete himself\nbehind some convenient abutment of brickwork until Mr Tom Jackson should\nhave got into the cellar. He therefore nimbly surmounted the railings--\nthe railings of his own h\u00c3\u00b4tel--and was gingerly descending the ladder,\nwhen lo! a rough hand seized him by the coat-collar and with a ferocious\njerk urged him backwards. The fact was, Theodore Racksole had counted\nwithout the policeman. That guardian of the peace, mistrusting\nRacksole's manner, quietly followed him down the lane. The sight of the\nmillionaire climbing the railings had put him on his mettle, and the\nresult was the ignominious capture of Racksole. In vain Theodore\nexpostulated, explained, anathematized. Only one thing would satisfy the\nstolid policeman--namely, that Racksole should return with him to the\nh\u00c3\u00b4tel and there establish his identity. If Racksole then proved to be\nRacksole, owner of the Grand Babylon, well and good--the policeman\npromised to apologize. So Theodore had no alternative but to accept the\nsuggestion. To prove his identity was, of course, the work of only a few\nminutes, after which Racksole, annoyed, but cool as ever, returned to\nhis railings, while the policeman went off to another part of his beat,\nwhere he would be likely to meet a comrade and have a chat.\n\nIn the meantime, our friend Jules, sublimely unconscious of the\naltercation going on outside, and of the special risk which he ran, was\nof course actually in the cellar, which he had reached before Racksole\ngot to the railings for the first time. It was, indeed, a happy chance\nfor Jules that his exit from the cellar coincided with the period during\nwhich Racksole was absent from the railings. As Racksole came down the\nlane for the second time, he saw a figure walking about fifty yards in\nfront of him towards the Embankment. Instantly he divined that it was\nJules, and that the policeman had thrown him just too late. He ran, and\nJules, hearing the noise of pursuit, ran also. The ex-waiter was fleet;\nhe made direct for a certain spot in the Embankment wall, and, to the\nintense astonishment of Racksole, jumped clean over the wall, as it\nseemed, into the river. 'Is he so desperate as to commit suicide?'\nRacksole exclaimed as he ran, but a second later the puff and snort of a\nsteam launch told him that Jules was not quite driven to suicide. As the\nmillionaire crossed the Embankment roadway he saw the funnel of the\nlaunch move out from under the river-wall. It swerved into midstream and\nheaded towards London Bridge. There was a silent mist over the river.\nRacksole was helpless....\n\nAlthough Racksole had now been twice worsted in a contest of wits within\nthe precincts of the Grand Babylon, once by Rocco and once by Jules, he\ncould not fairly blame himself for the present miscarriage of his plans-\n-a miscarriage due to the meddlesomeness of an extraneous person,\ncombined with pure ill-fortune. He did not, therefore, permit the\naccident to interfere with his sleep that night.\n\nOn the following day he sought out Prince Aribert, between whom and\nhimself there now existed a feeling of unmistakable, frank friendship,\nand disclosed to him the happenings of the previous night, and\nparticularly the tampering with the bottle of Roman\u00c3\u00a9e-Conti.\n\n'I believe you dined with Prince Eugen last night?'\n\n'I did. And curiously enough we had a bottle of Roman\u00c3\u00a9e-Conti, an\nadmirable wine, of which Eugen is passionately fond.'\n\n'And you will dine with him to-night?'\n\n'Most probably. To-day will, I fear, be our last day here. Eugen wishes\nto return to Posen early to-morrow.'\n\n'Has it struck you, Prince,' said Racksole, 'that if Jules had succeeded\nin poisoning your nephew, he would probably have succeeded also in\npoisoning you?'\n\n'I had not thought of it,' laughed Aribert, 'but it would seem so. It\nappears that so long as he brings down his particular quarry, Jules is\ncareless of anything else that may be accidentally involved in the\ndestruction. However, we need have no fear on that score now. You know\nthe bottle, and you can destroy it at once.'\n\n'But I do not propose to destroy it,' said Racksole calmly. 'If Prince\nEugen asks for Roman\u00c3\u00a9e-Conti to be served to-night, as he probably will,\nI propose that that precise bottle shall be served to him--and to you.'\n\n'Then you would poison us in spite of ourselves?'\n\n'Scarcely,' Racksole smiled. 'My notion is to discover the accomplices\nwithin the h\u00c3\u00b4tel. I have already inquired as to the wine-clerk, Hubbard.\nNow does it not occur to you as extraordinary that on this particular\nday Mr Hubbard should be ill in bed? Hubbard, I am informed, is\nsuffering from an attack of stomach poisoning, which has supervened\nduring the night. He says that he does not know what can have caused it.\nHis place in the wine cellars will be taken to-day by his assistant, a\nmere youth, but to all appearances a fairly smart youth. I need not say\nthat we shall keep an eye on that youth.'\n\n'One moment,' Prince Aribert interrupted. 'I do not quite understand how\nyou think the poisoning was to have been effected.'\n\n'The bottle is now under examination by an expert, who has instructions\nto remove as little as possible of the stuff which Jules put on the rim\nof the mouth of it. It will be secretly replaced in its bin during the\nday. My idea is that by the mere action of pouring out the wine takes up\nsome of the poison, which I deem to be very strong, and thus becomes\nfatal as it enters the glass.'\n\n'But surely the servant in attendance would wipe the mouth of the\nbottle?'\n\n'Very carelessly, perhaps. And moreover he would be extremely unlikely\nto wipe off all the stuff; some of it has been ingeniously placed just\non the inside edge of the rim. Besides, suppose he forgot to wipe the\nbottle?'\n\n'Prince Eugen is always served at dinner by Hans. It is an honour which\nthe faithful old fellow reserves for himself.'\n\n'But suppose Hans--' Racksole stopped.\n\n'Hans an accomplice! My dear Racksole, the suggestion is wildly\nimpossible.'\n\nThat night Prince Aribert dined with his august nephew in the superb\ndining-room of the Royal apartments. Hans served, the dishes being\nbrought to the door by other servants. Aribert found his nephew\ndespondent and taciturn. On the previous day, when, after the futile\ninterview with Sampson Levi, Prince Eugen had despairingly threatened to\ncommit suicide, in such a manner as to make it 'look like an accident',\nAribert had compelled him to give his word of honour not to do so.\n\n'What wine will your Royal Highness take?' asked old Hans in his\nsoothing tones, when the soup was served.\n\n'Sherry,' was Prince Eugen's curt order.\n\n'And Roman\u00c3\u00a9e-Conti afterwards?' said Hans. Aribert looked up quickly.\n\n'No, not to-night. I'll try Sillery to-night,' said Prince Eugen.\n\n'I think I'll have Roman\u00c3\u00a9e-Conti, Hans, after all,' he said. 'It suits\nme better than champagne.'\n\nThe famous and unsurpassable Burgundy was served with the roast. Old\nHans brought it tenderly in its wicker cradle, inserted the corkscrew\nwith mathematical precision, and drew the cork, which he offered for his\nmaster's inspection. Eugen nodded, and told him to put it down. Aribert\nwatched with intense interest. He could not for an instant believe that\nHans was not the very soul of fidelity, and yet, despite himself,\nRacksole's words had caused him a certain uneasiness. At that moment\nPrince Eugen murmured across the table:\n\n'Aribert, I withdraw my promise. Observe that, I withdraw it.' Aribert\nshook his head emphatically, without removing his gaze from Hans. The\nwhite-haired servant perfunctorily dusted his napkin round the neck of\nthe bottle of Roman\u00c3\u00a9e-Conti, and poured out a glass. Aribert trembled\nfrom head to foot.\n\nEugen took up the glass and held it to the light.\n\n'Don't drink it,' said Aribert very quietly. 'It is poisoned.'\n\n'Poisoned!' exclaimed Prince Eugen.\n\n'Poisoned, sire!' exclaimed old Hans, with an air of profound amazement\nand concern, and he seized the glass. 'Impossible, sire. I myself opened\nthe bottle. No one else has touched it, and the cork was perfect.'\n\n'I tell you it is poisoned,' Aribert repeated.\n\n'Your Highness will pardon an old man,' said Hans, 'but to say that this\nwine is poison is to say that I am a murderer. I will prove to you that\nit is not poisoned. I will drink it.' And he raised the glass to his\ntrembling lips. In that moment Aribert saw that old Hans, at any rate,\nwas not an accomplice of Jules. Springing up from his seat, he knocked\nthe glass from the aged servitor's hands, and the fragments of it fell\nwith a light tinkling crash partly on the table and partly on the floor.\nThe Prince and the servant gazed at one another in a distressing and\nterrible silence.\n\nThere was a slight noise, and Aribert looked aside. He saw that Eugen's\nbody had slipped forward limply over the left arm of his chair; the\nPrince's arms hung straight and lifeless; his eyes were closed; he was\nunconscious.\n\n'Hans!' murmured Aribert. 'Hans! What is this?'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twenty-Five THE STEAM LAUNCH\n\nMR TOM JACKSON's notion of making good his escape from the h\u00c3\u00b4tel by\nmeans of a steam launch was an excellent one, so far as it went, but\nTheodore Racksole, for his part, did not consider that it went quite far\nenough.\n\nTheodore Racksole opined, with peculiar glee, that he now had a tangible\nand definite clue for the catching of the Grand Babylon's ex-waiter. He\nknew nothing of the Port of London, but he happened to know a good deal\nof the far more complicated, though somewhat smaller, Port of New York,\nand he was sure there ought to be no extraordinary difficulty in getting\nhold of Jules' steam launch. To those who are not thoroughly familiar\nwith it the River Thames and its docks, from London Bridge to Gravesend,\nseems a vast and uncharted wilderness of craft--a wilderness in which it\nwould be perfectly easy to hide even a three-master successfully. To\nsuch people the idea of looking for a steam launch on the river would be\nabout equivalent to the idea of looking for a needle in a bundle of hay.\nBut the fact is, there are hundreds of men between St Katherine's Wharf\nand Blackwall who literally know the Thames as the suburban householder\nknows his back-garden--who can recognize thousands of ships and put a\nname to them at a distance of half a mile, who are informed as to every\nmovement of vessels on the great stream, who know all the captains, all\nthe engineers, all the lightermen, all the pilots, all the licensed\nwatermen, and all the unlicensed scoundrels from the Tower to Gravesend,\nand a lot further. By these experts of the Thames the slightest unusual\nevent on the water is noticed and discussed--a wherry cannot change\nhands but they will guess shrewdly upon the price paid and the\nintentions of the new owner with regard to it. They have a habit of\nwatching the river for the mere interest of the sight, and they talk\nabout everything like housewives gathered of an evening round the\ncottage door. If the first mate of a Castle Liner gets the sack they\nwill be able to tell you what he said to the captain, what the old man\nsaid to him, and what both said to the Board, and having finished off\nthat affair they will cheerfully turn to discussing whether Bill Stevens\nsank his barge outside the West Indian No.2 by accident or on purpose.\n\nTheodore Racksole had no satisfactory means of identifying the steam\nlaunch which carried away Mr Tom Jackson. The sky had clouded over soon\nafter midnight, and there was also a slight mist, and he had only been\nable to make out that it was a low craft, about sixty feet long,\nprobably painted black. He had personally kept a watch all through the\nnight on vessels going upstream, and during the next morning he had a\nman to take his place who warned him whenever a steam launch went\ntowards Westminster. At noon, after his conversation with Prince\nAribert, he went down the river in a hired row-boat as far as the Custom\nHouse, and poked about everywhere, in search of any vessel which could\nby any possibility be the one he was in search of.\n\nBut he found nothing. He was, therefore, tolerably sure that the\nmysterious launch lay somewhere below the Custom House. At the Custom\nHouse stairs, he landed, and asked for a very high official--an official\ninferior only to a Commissioner--whom he had entertained once in New\nYork, and who had met him in London on business at Lloyd's. In the large\nbut dingy office of this great man a long conversation took place--a\nconversation in which Racksole had to exercise a certain amount of\npersuasive power, and which ultimately ended in the high official\nringing his bell.\n\n'Desire Mr Hazell--room No. 332--to speak to me,' said the official to\nthe boy who answered the summons, and then, turning to Racksole: 'I need\nhardly repeat, my dear Mr Racksole, that this is strictly unofficial.'\n\n'Agreed, of course,' said Racksole.\n\nMr Hazell entered. He was a young man of about thirty, dressed in blue\nserge, with a pale, keen face, a brown moustache and a rather handsome\nbrown beard.\n\n'Mr Hazell,' said the high official, 'let me introduce you to Mr\nTheodore Racksole--you will doubtless be familiar with his name. Mr\nHazell,' he went on to Racksole, 'is one of our outdoor staff--what we\ncall an examining officer. Just now he is doing night duty. He has a\nboat on the river and a couple of men, and the right to board and\nexamine any craft whatever. What Mr Hazell and his crew don't know about\nthe Thames between here and Gravesend isn't knowledge.'\n\n'Glad to meet you, sir,' said Racksole simply, and they shook hands.\n\nRacksole observed with satisfaction that Mr Hazell was entirely at his\nease.\n\n'Now, Hazell,' the high official continued, 'Mr Racksole wants you to\nhelp in a little private expedition on the river to-night. I will give\nyou a night's leave. I sent for you partly because I thought you would\nenjoy the affair and partly because I think I can rely on you to regard\nit as entirely unofficial and not to talk about it. You understand? I\ndare say you will have no cause to regret having obliged Mr Racksole.'\n\n'I think I grasp the situation,' said Hazell, with a slight smile.\n\n'And, by the way,' added the high official, 'although the business is\nunofficial, it might be well if you wore your official overcoat. See?'\n\n'Decidedly,' said Hazell; 'I should have done so in any case.'\n\n'And now, Mr Hazell,' said Racksole, 'will you do me the pleasure of\nlunching with me? If you agree, I should like to lunch at the place you\nusually frequent.'\n\nSo it came to pass that Theodore Racksole and George Hazell, outdoor\nclerk in the Customs, lunched together at 'Thomas's Chop-House', in the\ncity of London, upon mutton-chops and coffee. The millionaire soon\ndiscovered that he had got hold of a keen-witted man and a person of\nmuch insight.\n\n'Tell me,' said Hazell, when they had reached the cigarette stage, 'are\nthe magazine writers anything like correct?'\n\n'What do you mean?' asked Racksole, mystified.\n\n'Well, you're a millionaire--\"one of the best\", I believe. One often\nsees articles on and interviews with millionaires, which describe their\nprivate railroad cars, their steam yachts on the Hudson, their marble\nstables, and so on, and so on. Do you happen to have those things?'\n\n'I have a private car on the New York Central, and I have a two thousand\nton schooner-yacht--though it isn't on the Hudson. It happens just now\nto be on East River. And I am bound to admit that the stables of my\nuptown place are fitted with marble.' Racksole laughed.\n\n'Ah!' said Hazell. 'Now I can believe that I am lunching with a\nmillionaire.\n\nIt's strange how facts like those--unimportant in themselves--appeal to\nthe imagination. You seem to me a real millionaire now. You've given me\nsome personal information; I'll give you some in return. I earn three\nhundred a year, and perhaps sixty pounds a year extra for overtime. I\nlive by myself in two rooms in Muscovy Court. I've as much money as I\nneed, and I always do exactly what I like outside office. As regards the\noffice, I do as little work as I can, on principle--it's a fight between\nus and the Commissioners who shall get the best. They try to do us down,\nand we try to do them down--it's pretty even on the whole. All's fair in\nwar, you know, and there ain't no ten commandments in a Government\noffice.'\n\nRacksole laughed. 'Can you get off this afternoon?' he asked.\n\n'Certainly,' said Hazell; 'I'll get one of my pals to sign on for me,\nand then I shall be free.'\n\n'Well,' said Racksole, 'I should like you to come down with me to the\nGrand Babylon. Then we can talk over my little affair at length. And may\nwe go on your boat? I want to meet your crew.'\n\n'That will be all right,' Hazell remarked. 'My two men are the idlest,\nmost soul-less chaps you ever saw. They eat too much, and they have an\nenormous appetite for beer; but they know the river, and they know their\nbusiness, and they will do anything within the fair game if they are\npaid for it, and aren't asked to hurry.'\n\nThat night, just after dark, Theodore Racksole embarked with his new\nfriend George Hazell in one of the black-painted Customs wherries,\nmanned by a crew of two men--both the later freemen of the river, a\ndistinction which carries with it certain privileges unfamiliar to the\nmere landsman. It was a cloudy and oppressive evening, not a star\nshowing to illumine the slow tide, now just past its flood. The vast\nforms of steamers at anchor--chiefly those of the General Steam\nNavigation and the Aberdeen Line--heaved themselves high out of the\nwater, straining sluggishly at their mooring buoys. On either side the\nnaked walls of warehouses rose like grey precipices from the stream,\nholding forth quaint arms of steam-cranes. To the west the Tower Bridge\nspanned the river with its formidable arch, and above that its suspended\nfootpath--a hundred and fifty feet from earth.\n\nDown towards the east and the Pool of London a forest of funnels and\nmasts was dimly outlined against the sinister sky. Huge barges, each\nsteered by a single man at the end of a pair of giant oars, lumbered and\nswirled down-stream at all angles. Occasionally a tug snorted busily\npast, flashing its red and green signals and dragging an unwieldy tail\nof barges in its wake. Then a Margate passenger steamer, its electric\nlights gleaming from every porthole, swerved round to anchor, with its\nload of two thousand fatigued excursionists. Over everything brooded an\nair of mystery--a spirit and feeling of strangeness, remoteness, and the\ninexplicable. As the broad flat little boat bobbed its way under the\nshadow of enormous hulks, beneath stretched hawsers, and past buoys\ncovered with green slime, Racksole could scarcely believe that he was in\nthe very heart of London--the most prosaic city in the world. He had a\nqueer idea that almost anything might happen in this seeming waste of\nwaters at this weird hour of ten o'clock. It appeared incredible to him\nthat only a mile or two away people were sitting in theatres applauding\nfarces, and that at Cannon Street Station, a few yards off, other people\nwere calmly taking the train to various highly respectable suburbs whose\nnames he was gradually learning. He had the uplifting sensation of being\nin another world which comes to us sometimes amid surroundings violently\ndifferent from our usual surroundings. The most ordinary noises--of men\ncalling, of a chain running through a slot, of a distant siren--\ntranslated themselves to his ears into terrible and haunting sounds,\nfull of portentous significance. He looked over the side of the boat\ninto the brown water, and asked himself what frightful secrets lay\nhidden in its depth. Then he put his hand into his hip-pocket and\ntouched the stock of his Colt revolver--that familiar substance\ncomforted him.\n\nThe oarsmen had instructions to drop slowly down to the Pool, as the\nwide reach below the Tower is called. These two men had not been\npreviously informed of the precise object of the expedition, but now\nthat they were safely afloat Hazell judged it expedient to give them\nsome notion of it. 'We expect to come across a rather suspicious steam\nlaunch,' he said. 'My friend here is very anxious to get a sight of her,\nand until he has seen her nothing definite can be done.'\n\n'What sort of a craft is she, sir?' asked the stroke oar, a fat-faced\nman who seemed absolutely incapable of any serious exertion.\n\n'I don't know,' Racksole replied; 'but as near as I can judge, she's\nabout sixty feet in length, and painted black. I fancy I shall recognize\nher when I see her.'\n\n'Not much to go by, that,' exclaimed the other man curtly. But he said\nno more. He, as well as his mate, had received from Theodore Racksole\none English sovereign as a kind of preliminary fee, and an English\nsovereign will do a lot towards silencing the natural sarcastic\ntendencies and free speech of a Thames waterman.\n\n'There's one thing I noticed,' said Racksole suddenly, 'and I forgot to\ntell you of it, Mr Hazell. Her screw seemed to move with a rather\nirregular, lame sort of beat.'\n\nBoth watermen burst into a laugh.\n\n'Oh,' said the fat rower, 'I know what you're after, sir--it's Jack\nEverett's launch, commonly called \"Squirm\". She's got a four-bladed\npropeller, and one blade is broken off short.'\n\n'Ay, that's it, sure enough,' agreed the man in the bows. 'And if it's\nher you want, I seed her lying up against Cherry Gardens Pier this very\nmorning.'\n\n'Let us go to Cherry Gardens Pier by all means, as soon as possible,'\n\nRacksole said, and the boat swung across stream and then began to creep\ndown by the right bank, feeling its way past wharves, many of which,\neven at that hour, were still busy with their cranes, that descended\nempty into the bellies of ships and came up full. As the two watermen\ngingerly manoeuvred the boat on the ebbing tide, Hazell explained to the\nmillionaire that the 'Squirm' was one of the most notorious craft on the\nriver. It appeared that when anyone had a nefarious or underhand scheme\nafoot which necessitated river work Everett's launch was always\navailable for a suitable monetary consideration. The 'Squirm' had got\nitself into a thousand scrapes, and out of those scrapes again with\nsafety, if not precisely with honour. The river police kept a watchful\neye on it, and the chief marvel about the whole thing was that old\nEverett, the owner, had never yet been seriously compromised in any\nillegal escapade. Not once had the officer of the law been able to prove\nanything definite against the proprietor of the 'Squirm', though several\nof its quondam hirers were at that very moment in various of Her\nMajesty's prisons throughout the country. Latterly, however, the launch,\nwith its damaged propeller, which Everett consistently refused to have\nrepaired, had acquired an evil reputation, even among evil-doers, and\nthis fraternity had gradually come to abandon it for less easily\nrecognizable craft.\n\n'Your friend, Mr Tom Jackson,' said Hazell to Racksole, 'committed an\nerror of discretion when he hired the \"Squirm\". A scoundrel of his\nexperience and calibre ought certainly to have known better than that.\nYou cannot fail to get a clue now.'\n\nBy this time the boat was approaching Cherry Gardens Pier, but\nunfortunately a thin night-fog had swept over the river, and objects\ncould not be discerned with any clearness beyond a distance of thirty\nyards. As the Customs boat scraped down past the pier all its occupants\nstrained eyes for a glimpse of the mysterious launch, but nothing could\nbe seen of it. The boat continued to float idly down-stream, the men\nresting on their oars.\n\nThen they narrowly escaped bumping a large Norwegian sailing vessel at\nanchor with her stem pointing down-stream. This ship they passed on the\nport side. Just as they got clear of her bowsprit the fat man cried out\nexcitedly, 'There's her nose!' and he put the boat about and began to\npull back against the tide. And surely the missing 'Squirm' was\ncomfortably anchored on the starboard quarter of the Norwegian ship,\nhidden neatly between the ship and the shore. The men pulled very\nquietly alongside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twenty-Six THE NIGHT CHASE AND THE MUDLARK\n\n'I'LL board her to start with,' said Hazell, whispering to Racksole.\n'I'll make out that I suspect they've got dutiable goods on board, and\nthat will give me a chance to have a good look at her.'\n\nDressed in his official overcoat and peaked cap, he stepped, rather\njauntily as Racksole thought, on to the low deck of the launch. 'Anyone\naboard?'\n\nRacksole heard him cry out, and a woman's voice answered. 'I'm a Customs\nexamining officer, and I want to search the launch,' Hazell shouted, and\nthen disappeared down into the little saloon amidships, and Racksole\nheard no more. It seemed to the millionaire that Hazell had been gone\nhours, but at length he returned.\n\n'Can't find anything,' he said, as he jumped into the boat, and then\nprivately to Racksole: 'There's a woman on board. Looks as if she might\ncoincide with your description of Miss Spencer. Steam's up, but there's\nno engineer. I asked where the engineer was, and she inquired what\nbusiness that was of mine, and requested me to get through with my own\nbusiness and clear off. Seems rather a smart sort. I poked my nose into\neverything, but I saw no sign of any one else. Perhaps we'd better pull\naway and lie near for a bit, just to see if anything queer occurs.'\n\n'You're quite sure he isn't on board?' Racksole asked.\n\n'Quite,' said Hazell positively: 'I know how to search a vessel. See\nthis,' and he handed to Racksole a sort of steel skewer, about two feet\nlong, with a wooden handle. 'That,' he said, 'is one of the Customs'\naids to searching.'\n\n'I suppose it wouldn't do to go on board and carry off the lady?'\nRacksole suggested doubtfully.\n\n'Well,' Hazell began, with equal doubtfulness, 'as for that--'\n\n'Where's 'e orf?' It was the man in the bows who interrupted Hazell.\n\nFollowing the direction of the man's finger, both Hazell and Racksole\nsaw with more or less distinctness a dinghy slip away from the forefoot\nof the Norwegian vessel and disappear downstream into the mist.\n\n'It's Jules, I'll swear,' cried Racksole. 'After him, men. Ten pounds\napiece if we overtake him!'\n\n'Lay down to it now, boys!' said Hazell, and the heavy Customs boat shot\nout in pursuit.\n\n'This is going to be a lark,' Racksole remarked.\n\n'Depends on what you call a lark,' said Hazell; 'it's not much of a lark\ntearing down midstream like this in a fog. You never know when you\nmayn't be in kingdom come with all these barges knocking around. I\nexpect that chap hid in the dinghy when he first caught sight of us, and\nthen slipped his painter as soon as I'd gone.'\n\nThe boat was moving at a rapid pace with the tide. Steering was a matter\nof luck and instinct more than anything else. Every now and then Hazell,\nwho held the lines, was obliged to jerk the boat's head sharply round to\navoid a barge or an anchored vessel. It seemed to Racksole that vessels\nwere anchored all over the stream. He looked about him anxiously, but\nfor a long time he could see nothing but mist and vague nautical forms.\nThen suddenly he said, quietly enough, 'We're on the right road; I can\nsee him ahead.\n\nWe're gaining on him.' In another minute the dinghy was plainly visible,\nnot twenty yards away, and the sculler--sculling frantically now--was\nunmistakably Jules--Jules in a light tweed suit and a bowler hat.\n\n'You were right,' Hazell said; 'this is a lark. I believe I'm getting\nquite excited. It's more exciting than playing the trombone in an\norchestra. I'll run him down, eh?--and then we can drag the chap in from\nthe water.'\n\nRacksole nodded, but at that moment a barge, with her red sails set,\nstood out of the fog clean across the bows of the Customs boat, which\nnarrowly escaped instant destruction. When they got clear, and the usual\ninterchange of calm, nonchalant swearing was over, the dinghy was barely\nto be discerned in the mist, and the fat man was breathing in such a\nmanner that his sighs might almost have been heard on the banks.\nRacksole wanted violently to do something, but there was nothing to do;\nhe could only sit supine by Hazell's side in the stern-sheets. Gradually\nthey began again to overtake the dinghy, whose one-man crew was\nevidently tiring. As they came up, hand over fist, the dinghy's nose\nswerved aside, and the tiny craft passed down a water-lane between two\nanchored mineral barges, which lay black and deserted about fifty yards\nfrom the Surrey shore. 'To starboard,' said Racksole. 'No, man!'\n\nHazell replied; 'we can't get through there. He's bound to come out\nbelow; it's only a feint. I'll keep our nose straight ahead.'\n\nAnd they went on, the fat man pounding away, with a face which glistened\neven in the thick gloom. It was an empty dinghy which emerged from\nbetween the two barges and went drifting and revolving down towards\nGreenwich.\n\nThe fat man gasped a word to his comrade, and the Customs boat stopped\ndead.\n\n''E's all right,' said the man in the bows. 'If it's 'im you want, 'e's\non one o' them barges, so you've only got to step on and take 'im orf.'\n\n'That's all,' said a voice out of the depths of the nearest barge, and\nit was the voice of Jules, otherwise known as Mr Tom Jackson.\n\n''Ear 'im?' said the fat man smiling. ''E's a good 'un, 'e is. But if I\nwas you, Mr Hazell, or you, sir, I shouldn't step on to that barge so\nquick as all that.'\n\nThey backed the boat under the stem of the nearest barge and gazed\nupwards.\n\n'It's all right,' said Racksole to Hazell; 'I've got a revolver. How can\nI clamber up there?'\n\n'Yes, I dare say you've got a revolver all right,' Hazell replied\nsharply.\n\n'But you mustn't use it. There mustn't be any noise. We should have the\nriver police down on us in a twinkling if there was a revolver shot, and\nit would be the ruin of me. If an inquiry was held the Commissioners\nwouldn't take any official notice of the fact that my superior officer\nhad put me on to this job, and I should be requested to leave the\nservice.'\n\n'Have no fear on that score,' said Racksole. 'I shall, of course, take\nall responsibility.'\n\n'It wouldn't matter how much responsibility you took,' Hazell retorted;\n'you wouldn't put me back into the service, and my career would be at an\nend.'\n\n'But there are other careers,' said Racksole, who was really anxious to\nlame his ex-waiter by means of a judiciously-aimed bullet. 'There are\nother careers.'\n\n'The Customs is my career,' said Hazell, 'so let's have no shooting.\nWe'll wait about a bit; he can't escape. You can have my skewer if you\nlike'--and he gave Racksole his searching instrument. 'And you can do\nwhat you please, provided you do it neatly and don't make a row over\nit.'\n\nFor a few moments the four men were passive in the boat, surrounded by\nswirling mist, with black water beneath them, and towering above them a\nhalf-loaded barge with a desperate and resourceful man on board.\nSuddenly the mist parted and shrivelled away in patches, as though\nbefore the breath of some monster. The sky was visible; it was a clear\nsky, and the moon was shining. The transformation was just one of those\nmeteorological quick-changes which happen most frequently on a great\nriver.\n\n'That's a sight better,' said the fat man. At the same moment a head\nappeared over the edge of the barge. It was Jules' face--dark, sinister\nand leering.\n\n'Is it Mr Racksole in that boat?' he inquired calmly; 'because if so,\nlet Mr Racksole step up. Mr Racksole has caught me, and he can have me\nfor the asking. Here I am.' He stood up to his full height on the barge,\ntall against the night sky, and all the occupants of the boat could see\nthat he held firmly clasped in his right hand a short dagger. 'Now, Mr\nRacksole, you've been after me for a long time,' he continued; 'here I\nam. Why don't you step up? If you haven't got the pluck yourself,\npersuade someone else to step up in your place ... the same fair\ntreatment will be accorded to all.' And Jules laughed a low, penetrating\nlaugh.\n\nHe was in the midst of this laugh when he lurched suddenly forward.\n\n'What'r' you doing of aboard my barge? Off you goes!' It was a boy's\nsmall shrill voice that sounded in the night. A ragged boy's small form\nhad appeared silently behind Jules, and two small arms with a vicious\nshove precipitated him into the water. He fell with a fine gurgling\nsplash. It was at once obvious that swimming was not among Jules'\naccomplishments. He floundered wildly and sank. When he reappeared he\nwas dragged into the Customs boat. Rope was produced, and in a minute or\ntwo the man lay ignominiously bound in the bottom of the boat. With the\naid of a mudlark--a mere barge boy, who probably had no more right on\nthe barge than Jules himself--Racksole had won his game. For the first\ntime for several weeks the millionaire experienced a sensation of\nequanimity and satisfaction. He leaned over the prostrate form of Jules,\nHazell's professional skewer in his hand.\n\n'What are you going to do with him now?' asked Hazell.\n\n'We'll row up to the landing steps in front of the Grand Babylon. He\nshall be well lodged at my h\u00c3\u00b4tel, I promise him.'\n\nJules spoke no word.\n\nBefore Racksole parted company with the Customs man that night Jules had\nbeen safely transported into the Grand Babylon H\u00c3\u00b4tel and the two\nwatermen had received their \u00c2\u00a310 apiece.\n\n'You will sleep here?' said the millionaire to Mr George Hazell. 'It is\nlate.'\n\n'With pleasure,' said Hazell. The next morning he found a sumptuous\nbreakfast awaiting him, and in his table-napkin was a Bank of England\nnote for a hundred pounds. But, though he did not hear of them till much\nlater, many things had happened before Hazell consumed that sumptuous\nbreakfast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twenty-Seven THE CONFESSION OF MR TOM JACKSON\n\nIT happened that the small bedroom occupied by Jules during the years he\nwas head-waiter at the Grand Babylon had remained empty since his sudden\ndismissal by Theodore Racksole. No other head-waiter had been formally\nappointed in his place; and, indeed, the absence of one man--even the\nunique Jules--could scarcely have been noticed in the enormous staff of\na place like the Grand Babylon. The functions of a head-waiter are\ngenerally more ornamental, spectacular, and morally impressive than\nuseful, and it was so at the great h\u00c3\u00b4tel on the Embankment. Racksole\naccordingly had the excellent idea of transporting his prisoner, with as\nmuch secrecy as possible, to this empty bedroom. There proved to be no\ndifficulty in doing so; Jules showed himself perfectly amenable to a\nshow of superior force.\n\nRacksole took upstairs with him an old commissionaire who had been\nattached to the outdoor service of the h\u00c3\u00b4tel for many years--a grey-\nhaired man, wiry as a terrier and strong as a mastiff. Entering the\nbedroom with Jules, whose hands were bound, he told the commissionaire\nto remain outside the door.\n\nJules' bedroom was quite an ordinary apartment, though perhaps slightly\nsuperior to the usual accommodation provided for servants in the\ncaravanserais of the West End. It was about fourteen by twelve. It was\nfurnished with a bedstead, a small wardrobe, a small washstand and\ndressing-table, and two chairs. There were two hooks behind the door, a\nstrip of carpet by the bed, and some cheap ornaments on the iron\nmantelpiece. There was also one electric light. The window was a little\nsquare one, high up from the floor, and it looked on the inner\nquadrangle.\n\nThe room was on the top storey--the eighth--and from it you had a view\nsheer to the ground. Twenty feet below ran a narrow cornice about a foot\nwide; three feet or so above the window another and wider cornice jutted\nout, and above that was the high steep roof of the h\u00c3\u00b4tel, though you\ncould not see it from the window. As Racksole examined the window and\nthe outlook, he said to himself that Jules could not escape by that\nexit, at any rate. He gave a glance up the chimney, and saw that the\nflue was far too small to admit a man's body.\n\nThen he called in the commissionaire, and together they bound Jules\nfirmly to the bedstead, allowing him, however, to lie down. All the\nwhile the captive never opened his mouth--merely smiled a smile of\ndisdain. Finally Racksole removed the ornaments, the carpet, the chairs\nand the hooks, and wrenched away the switch of the electric light. Then\nhe and the commissionaire left the room, and Racksole locked the door on\nthe outside and put the key in his pocket.\n\n'You will keep watch here,' he said to the commissionaire, 'through the\nnight. You can sit on this chair. Don't go to sleep. If you hear the\nslightest noise in the room blow your cab-whistle; I will arrange to\nanswer the signal. If there is no noise do nothing whatever. I don't\nwant this talked about, you understand. I shall trust you; you can trust\nme.'\n\n'But the servants will see me here when they get up to-morrow,' said the\ncommissionaire, with a faint smile, 'and they will be pretty certain to\nask what I'm doing of up here. What shall I say to 'em?'\n\n'You've been a soldier, haven't you?' asked Racksole.\n\n'I've seen three campaigns, sir,' was the reply, and, with a gesture of\npardonable pride, the grey-haired fellow pointed to the medals on his\nbreast.\n\n'Well, supposing you were on sentry duty and some meddlesome person in\ncamp asked you what you were doing--what should you say?'\n\n'I should tell him to clear off or take the consequences, and pretty\nquick too.'\n\n'Do that to-morrow morning, then, if necessary,' said Racksole, and\ndeparted.\n\nIt was then about one o'clock a.m. The millionaire retired to bed--not\nhis own bed, but a bed on the seventh storey. He did not, however, sleep\nvery long. Shortly after dawn he was wide awake, and thinking busily\nabout Jules.\n\nHe was, indeed, very curious to know Jules' story, and he determined, if\nthe thing could be done at all, by persuasion or otherwise, to extract\nit from him. With a man of Theodore Racksole's temperament there is no\ntime like the present, and at six o'clock, as the bright morning sun\nbrought gaiety into the window, he dressed and went upstairs again to\nthe eighth storey. The commissionaire sat stolid, but alert on his\nchair, and, at the sight of his master, rose and saluted.\n\n'Anything happened?' Racksole asked.\n\n'Nothing, sir.'\n\n'Servants say anything?'\n\n'Only a dozen or so of 'em are up yet, sir. One of 'em asked what I was\nplaying at, and so I told her I was looking after a bull bitch and a\nlitter of pups that you was very particular about, sir.'\n\n'Good,' said Racksole, as he unlocked the door and entered the room. All\nwas exactly as he had left it, except that Jules who had been lying on\nhis back, had somehow turned over and was now lying on his face. He\ngazed silently, scowling at the millionaire. Racksole greeted him and\nostentatiously took a revolver from his hip-pocket and laid it on the\ndressing-table. Then he seated himself on the dressing-table by the side\nof the revolver, his legs dangling an inch or two above the floor.\n\n'I want to have a talk to you, Jackson,' he began.\n\n'You can talk to me as much as you like,' said Jules. 'I shan't\ninterfere, you may bet on that.'\n\n'I should like you to answer some questions.'\n\n'That's different,' said Jules. 'I'm not going to answer any questions\nwhile I'm tied up like this. You may bet on that, too.'\n\n'It will pay you to be reasonable,' said Racksole.\n\n'I'm not going to answer any questions while I'm tied up.'\n\n'I'll unfasten your legs, if you like,' Racksole suggested politely,\n'then you can sit up. It's no use you pretending you've been\nuncomfortable, because I know you haven't. I calculate you've been\ntreated very handsomely, my son. There you are!' and he loosened the\nlower extremities of his prisoner from their bonds. 'Now I repeat you\nmay as well be reasonable. You may as well admit that you've been fairly\nbeaten in the game and act accordingly. I was determined to beat you, by\nmyself, without the police, and I've done it.'\n\n'You've done yourself,' retorted Jules. 'You've gone against the law. If\nyou'd had any sense you wouldn't have meddled; you'd have left\neverything to the police. They'd have muddled about for a year or two,\nand then done nothing. Who's going to tell the police now? Are you? Are\nyou going to give me up to 'em, and say, \"Here, I've caught him for\nyou\". If you do they'll ask you to explain several things, and then\nyou'll look foolish. One crime doesn't excuse another, and you'll find\nthat out.'\n\nWith unerring insight, Jules had perceived exactly the difficulty of\nRacksole's position, and it was certainly a difficulty which Racksole\ndid not attempt to minimize to himself. He knew well that it would have\nto be faced. He did not, however, allow Jules to guess his thoughts.\n\n'Meanwhile,' he said calmly to the other, 'you're here and my prisoner.\n\nYou've committed a variegated assortment of crimes, and among them is\nmurder. You are due to be hung. You know that. There is no reason why I\nshould call in the police at all. It will be perfectly easy for me to\nfinish you off, as you deserve, myself. I shall only be carrying out\njustice, and robbing the hangman of his fee. Precisely as I brought you\ninto the h\u00c3\u00b4tel, I can take you out again. A few days ago you borrowed or\nstole a steam yacht at Ostend. What you have done with it I don't know,\nnor do I care. But I strongly suspect that my daughter had a narrow\nescape of being murdered on your steam yacht. Now I have a steam yacht\nof my own. Suppose I use it as you used yours! Suppose I smuggle you on\nto it, steam out to sea, and then ask you to step off it into the ocean\none night. Such things have been done.\n\nSuch things will be done again. If I acted so, I should at least, have\nthe satisfaction of knowing that I had relieved society from the incubus\nof a scoundrel.'\n\n'But you won't,' Jules murmured.\n\n'No,' said Racksole steadily, 'I won't--if you behave yourself this\nmorning. But I swear to you that if you don't I will never rest till you\nare dead, police or no police. You don't know Theodore Racksole.'\n\n'I believe you mean it,' Jules exclaimed, with an air of surprised\ninterest, as though he had discovered something of importance.\n\n'I believe I do,' Racksole resumed. 'Now listen. At the best, you will\nbe given up to the police. At the worst, I shall deal with you myself.\nWith the police you may have a chance--you may get off with twenty\nyears' penal servitude, because, though it is absolutely certain that\nyou murdered Reginald Dimmock, it would be a little difficult to prove\nthe case against you. But with me you would have no chance whatever. I\nhave a few questions to put to you, and it will depend on how you answer\nthem whether I give you up to the police or take the law into my own\nhands. And let me tell you that the latter course would be much simpler\nfor me. And I would take it, too, did I not feel that you were a very\nclever and exceptional man; did I not have a sort of sneaking admiration\nfor your detestable skill and ingenuity.'\n\n'You think, then, that I am clever?' said Jules. 'You are right. I am. I\nshould have been much too clever for you if luck had not been against\nme.\n\nYou owe your victory, not to skill, but to luck.'\n\n'That is what the vanquished always say. Waterloo was a bit of pure luck\nfor the English, no doubt, but it was Waterloo all the same.'\n\nJules yawned elaborately. 'What do you want to know?' he inquired, with\npoliteness.\n\n'First and foremost, I want to know the names of your accomplices inside\nthis h\u00c3\u00b4tel.'\n\n'I have no more,' said Jules. 'Rocco was the last.'\n\n'Don't begin by lying to me. If you had no accomplice, how did you\ncontrive that one particular bottle of Roman\u00c3\u00a9e-Conti should be served to\nhis Highness Prince Eugen?'\n\n'Then you discovered that in time, did you?' said Jules. 'I was afraid\nso.\n\nLet me explain that that needed no accomplice. The bottle was topmost in\nthe bin, and naturally it would be taken. Moreover, I left it sticking\nout a little further than the rest.'\n\n'You did not arrange, then, that Hubbard should be taken ill the night\nbefore last?'\n\n'I had no idea,' said Jules, 'that the excellent Hubbard was not\nenjoying his accustomed health.'\n\n'Tell me,' said Racksole, 'who or what is the origin of your vendetta\nagainst the life of Prince Eugen?'\n\n'I had no vendetta against the life of Prince Eugen,' said Jules, 'at\nleast, not to begin with. I merely undertook, for a consideration, to\nsee that Prince Eugen did not have an interview with a certain Mr\nSampson Levi in London before a certain date, that was all. It seemed\nsimple enough. I had been engaged in far more complicated transactions\nbefore. I was convinced that I could manage it, with the help of Rocco\nand Em--and Miss Spencer.'\n\n'Is that woman your wife?'\n\n'She would like to be,' he sneered. 'Please don't interrupt. I had\ncompleted my arrangements, when you so inconsiderately bought the h\u00c3\u00b4tel.\nI don't mind admitting now that from the very moment when you came\nacross me that night in the corridor I was secretly afraid of you,\nthough I scarcely admitted the fact even to myself then. I thought it\nsafer to shift the scene of our operations to Ostend. I had meant to\ndeal with Prince Eugen in this h\u00c3\u00b4tel, but I decided, then, to intercept\nhim on the Continent, and I despatched Miss Spencer with some\ninstructions. Troubles never come singly, and it happened that just then\nthat fool Dimmock, who had been in the swim with us, chose to prove\nrefractory. The slightest hitch would have upset everything, and I was\nobliged to--to clear him off the scene. He wanted to back out--he had a\nbad attack of conscience, and violent measures were essential. I regret\nhis untimely decease, but he brought it on himself. Well, everything was\ngoing serenely when you and your brilliant daughter, apparently\ndetermined to meddle, turned up again among us at Ostend. Only twenty-\nfour hours, however, had to elapse before the date which had been\nmentioned to me by my employers. I kept poor little Eugen for the\nallotted time, and then you managed to get hold of him. I do not deny\nthat you scored there, though, according to my original instructions,\nyou scored too late. The time had passed, and so, so far as I knew, it\ndidn't matter a pin whether Prince Eugen saw Mr Sampson Levi or not. But\nmy employers were still uneasy. They were uneasy even after little Eugen\nhad lain ill in Ostend for several weeks. It appears that they feared\nthat even at that date an interview between Prince Eugen and Mr Sampson\nLevi might work harm to them. So they applied to me again. This time\nthey wanted Prince Eugen to be--em--finished off entirely. They offered\nhigh terms.'\n\n'What terms?'\n\n'I had received fifty thousand pounds for the first job, of which Rocco\nhad half. Rocco was also to be made a member of a certain famous\nEuropean order, if things went right. That was what he coveted far more\nthan the money--the vain fellow! For the second job I was offered a\nhundred thousand. A tolerably large sum. I regret that I have not been\nable to earn it.'\n\n'Do you mean to tell me,' asked Racksole, horror-struck by this calm\nconfession, in spite of his previous knowledge, 'that you were offered a\nhundred thousand pounds to poison Prince Eugen?'\n\n'You put it rather crudely,' said Jules in reply. 'I prefer to say that\nI was offered a hundred thousand pounds if Prince Eugen should die\nwithin a reasonable time.'\n\n'And who were your damnable employers?'\n\n'That, honestly, I do not know.'\n\n'You know, I suppose, who paid you the first fifty thousand pounds, and\nwho promised you the hundred thousand.'\n\n'Well,' said Jules, 'I know vaguely. I know that he came via Vienna\nfrom--em--Bosnia. My impression was that the affair had some bearing,\ndirect or indirect, on the projected marriage of the King of Bosnia. He\nis a young monarch, scarcely out of political leading-strings, as it\nwere, and doubtless his Ministers thought that they had better arrange\nhis marriage for him. They tried last year, and failed because the\nPrincess whom they had in mind had cast her sparkling eyes on another\nPrince. That Prince happened to be Prince Eugen of Posen. The Ministers\nof the King of Bosnia knew exactly the circumstances of Prince Eugen.\nThey knew that he could not marry without liquidating his debts, and\nthey knew that he could only liquidate his debts through this Jew,\nSampson Levi. Unfortunately for me, they ultimately wanted to make too\nsure of Prince Eugen. They were afraid he might after all arrange his\nmarriage without the aid of Mr Sampson Levi, and so--well, you know the\nrest.... It is a pity that the poor little innocent King of Bosnia can't\nhave the Princess of his Ministers' choice.'\n\n'Then you think that the King himself had no part in this abominable\ncrime?'\n\n'I think decidedly not.'\n\n'I am glad of that,' said Racksole simply. 'And now, the name of your\nimmediate employer.'\n\n'He was merely an agent. He called himself Sleszak--S-l-e-s-z-a-k. But I\nimagine that that wasn't his real name. I don't know his real name. An\nold man, he often used to be found at the H\u00c3\u00b4tel Ritz, Paris.'\n\n'Mr Sleszak and I will meet,' said Racksole.\n\n'Not in this world,' said Jules quickly. 'He is dead. I heard only last\nnight--just before our little tussle.'\n\nThere was a silence.\n\n'It is well,' said Racksole at length. 'Prince Eugen lives, despite all\nplots. After all, justice is done.'\n\n'Mr Racksole is here, but he can see no one, Miss.' The words came from\nbehind the door, and the voice was the commissionaire's. Racksole\nstarted up, and went towards the door.\n\n'Nonsense,' was the curt reply, in feminine tones. 'Move aside\ninstantly.'\n\nThe door opened, and Nella entered. There were tears in her eyes.\n\n'Oh! Dad,' she exclaimed, 'I've only just heard you were in the h\u00c3\u00b4tel.\nWe looked for you everywhere. Come at once, Prince Eugen is dying--'\nThen she saw the man sitting on the bed, and stopped.\n\nLater, when Jules was alone again, he remarked to himself, 'I may get\nthat hundred thousand.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twenty-Eight THE STATE BEDROOM ONCE MORE\n\nWHEN, immediately after the episode of the bottle of Roman\u00c3\u00a9e-Conti in\nthe State dining-room, Prince Aribert and old Hans found that Prince\nEugen had sunk in an unconscious heap over his chair, both the former\nthought, at the first instant, that Eugen must have already tasted the\npoisoned wine. But a moment's reflection showed that this was not\npossible. If the Hereditary Prince of Posen was dying or dead, his\ncondition was due to some other agency than the Roman\u00c3\u00a9e-Conti. Aribert\nbent over him, and a powerful odour from the man's lips at once\ndisclosed the cause of the disaster: it was the odour of laudanum.\nIndeed, the smell of that sinister drug seemed now to float heavily over\nthe whole table. Across Aribert's mind there flashed then the true\nexplanation. Prince Eugen, taking advantage of Aribert's attention being\nmomentarily diverted; and yielding to a sudden impulse of despair, had\ndecided to poison himself, and had carried out his intention on the\nspot.\n\nThe laudanum must have been already in his pocket, and this fact went to\nprove that the unfortunate Prince had previously contemplated such a\nproceeding, even after his definite promise. Aribert remembered now with\npainful vividness his nephew's words: 'I withdraw my promise. Observe\nthat--I withdraw it.' It must have been instantly after the utterance of\nthat formal withdrawal that Eugen attempted to destroy himself.\n\n'It's laudanum, Hans,' Aribert exclaimed, rather helplessly.\n\n'Surely his Highness has not taken poison?' said Hans. 'It is\nimpossible!'\n\n'I fear it is only too possible,' said the other. 'It's laudanum. What\nare we to do? Quick, man!'\n\n'His Highness must be roused, Prince. He must have an emetic. We had\nbetter carry him to the bedroom.'\n\nThey did, and laid him on the great bed; and then Aribert mixed an\nemetic of mustard and water, and administered it, but without any\neffect. The sufferer lay motionless, with every muscle relaxed. His skin\nwas ice-cold to the touch, and the eyelids, half-drawn, showed that the\npupils were painfully contracted.\n\n'Go out, and send for a doctor, Hans. Say that Prince Eugen has been\nsuddenly taken ill, but that it isn't serious. The truth must never be\nknown.'\n\n'He must be roused, sire,' Hans said again, as he hurried from the room.\n\nAribert lifted his nephew from the bed, shook him, pinched him, flicked\nhim cruelly, shouted at him, dragged him about, but to no avail. At\nlength he desisted, from mere physical fatigue, and laid the Prince back\nagain on the bed. Every minute that elapsed seemed an hour. Alone with\nthe unconscious organism in the silence of the great stately chamber,\nunder the cold yellow glare of the electric lights, Aribert became a\nprey to the most despairing thoughts. The tragedy of his nephew's career\nforced itself upon him, and it occurred to him that an early and\nshameful death had all along been inevitable for this good-natured,\nweak-purposed, unhappy child of a historic throne. A little good\nfortune, and his character, so evenly balanced between right and wrong,\nmight have followed the proper path, and Eugen might have figured at any\nrate with dignity on the European stage. But now it appeared that all\nwas over, the last stroke played. And in this disaster Aribert saw the\nruin of his own hopes. For Aribert would have to occupy his nephew's\nthrone, and he felt instinctively that nature had not cut him out for a\nthrone. By a natural impulse he inwardly rebelled against the prospect\nof monarchy. Monarchy meant so much for which he knew himself to be\nentirely unfitted. It meant a political marriage, which means a forced\nmarriage, a union against inclination. And then what of Nella--Nella!\n\nHans returned. 'I have sent for the nearest doctor, and also for a\nspecialist,' he said.\n\n'Good,' said Aribert. 'I hope they will hurry.' Then he sat down and\nwrote a card. 'Take this yourself to Miss Racksole. If she is out of the\nh\u00c3\u00b4tel, ascertain where she is and follow her. Understand, it is of the\nfirst importance.'\n\nHans bowed, and departed for the second time, and Aribert was alone\nagain.\n\nHe gazed at Eugen, and made another frantic attempt to rouse him from\nthe deadly stupor, but it was useless. He walked away to the window:\nthrough the opened casement he could hear the tinkle of passing hansoms\non the Embankment below, whistles of door-keepers, and the hoot of steam\ntugs on the river. The world went on as usual, it appeared. It was an\nabsurd world.\n\nHe desired nothing better than to abandon his princely title, and live\nas a plain man, the husband of the finest woman on earth.... But now!...\n\nPah! How selfish he was, to be thinking of himself when Eugen lay dying.\nYet--Nella!\n\nThe door opened, and a man entered, who was obviously the doctor. A few\ncurt questions, and he had grasped the essentials of the case. 'Oblige\nme by ringing the bell, Prince. I shall want some hot water, and an\nable-bodied man and a nurse.'\n\n'Who wants a nurse?' said a voice, and Nella came quietly in. 'I am a\nnurse,' she added to the doctor, 'and at your orders.'\n\nThe next two hours were a struggle between life and death. The first\ndoctor, a specialist who followed him, Nella, Prince Aribert, and old\nHans formed, as it were, a league to save the dying man. None else in\nthe h\u00c3\u00b4tel knew the real seriousness of the case. When a Prince falls\nill, and especially by his own act, the precise truth is not issued\nbroadcast to the universe.\n\nAccording to official intelligence, a Prince is never seriously ill\nuntil he is dead. Such is statecraft.\n\nThe worst feature of Prince Eugen's case was that emetics proved futile.\n\nNeither of the doctors could explain their failure, but it was only too\napparent. The league was reduced to helplessness. At last the great\nspecialist from Manchester Square gave it out that there was no chance\nfor Prince Eugen unless the natural vigour of his constitution should\nprove capable of throwing off the poison unaided by scientific\nassistance, as a drunkard can sleep off his potion. Everything had been\ntried, even to artificial respiration and the injection of hot coffee.\nHaving emitted this pronouncement, the great specialist from Manchester\nSquare left. It was one o'clock in the morning. By one of those strange\nand futile coincidences which sometimes startle us by their subtle\nsignificance, the specialist met Theodore Racksole and his captive as\nthey were entering the h\u00c3\u00b4tel. Neither had the least suspicion of the\nother's business.\n\nIn the State bedroom the small group of watchers surrounded the bed. The\nslow minutes filed away in dreary procession. Another hour passed. Then\nthe figure on the bed, hitherto so motionless, twitched and moved; the\nlips parted.\n\n'There is hope,' said the doctor, and administered a stimulant which was\nhanded to him by Nella.\n\nIn a quarter of an hour the patient had regained consciousness. For the\nten thousandth time in the history of medicine a sound constitution had\naccomplished a miracle impossible to the accumulated medical skill of\ncenturies.\n\nIn due course the doctor left, saying that Prince Eugen was 'on the high\nroad to recovery,' and promising to come again within a few hours.\nMorning had dawned. Nella drew the great curtains, and let in a flood of\nsunlight.\n\nOld Hans, overcome by fatigue, dozed in a chair in a far corner of the\nroom.\n\nThe reaction had been too much for him. Nella and Prince Aribert looked\nat each other. They had not exchanged a word about themselves, yet each\nknew what the other had been thinking. They clasped hands with a perfect\nunderstanding. Their brief love-making had been of the silent kind, and\nit was silent now. No word was uttered. A shadow had passed from over\nthem, but only their eyes expressed relief and joy.\n\n'Aribert!' The faint call came from the bed. Aribert went to the\nbedside, while Nella remained near the window.\n\n'What is it, Eugen?' he said. 'You are better now.'\n\n'You think so?' murmured the other. 'I want you to forgive me for all\nthis, Aribert. I must have caused you an intolerable trouble. I did it\nso clumsily; that is what annoys me. Laudanum was a feeble expedient;\nbut I could think of nothing else, and I daren't ask anyone for advice.\nI was obliged to go out and buy the stuff for myself. It was all very\nawkward.\n\nBut, thank goodness, it has not been ineffectual.'\n\n'What do you mean, Eugen? You are better. In a day or so you will be\nperfectly recovered.'\n\n'I am dying,' said Eugen quietly. 'Do not be deceived. I die because I\nwish to die. It is bound to be so. I know by the feel of my heart. In a\nfew hours it will be over. The throne of Posen will be yours, Aribert.\nYou will fill it more worthily than I have done. Don't let them know\nover there that I poisoned myself. Swear Hans to secrecy; swear the\ndoctors to secrecy; and breathe no word yourself. I have been a fool,\nbut I do not wish it to be known that I was also a coward. Perhaps it is\nnot cowardice; perhaps it is courage, after all--courage to cut the\nknot. I could not have survived the disgrace of any revelations,\nAribert, and revelations would have been sure to come. I have made a\nfool of myself, but I am ready to pay for it. We of Posen--we always\npay--everything except our debts. Ah! those debts! Had it not been for\nthose I could have faced her who was to have been my wife, to have\nshared my throne. I could have hidden my past, and begun again. With her\nhelp I really could have begun again. But Fate has been against me--\nalways! always! By the way, what was that plot against me, Aribert? I\nforget, I forget.'\n\nHis eyes closed. There was a sudden noise. Old Hans had slipped from his\nchair to the floor. He picked himself up, dazed, and crept shamefacedly\nout of the room.\n\nAribert took his nephew's hand.\n\n'Nonsense, Eugen! You are dreaming. You will be all right soon. Pull\nyourself together.'\n\n'All because of a million,' the sick man moaned. 'One miserable million\nEnglish pounds. The national debt of Posen is fifty millions, and I, the\nPrince of Posen, couldn't borrow one. If I could have got it, I might\nhave held my head up again. Good-bye, Aribert.... Who is that girl?'\n\nAribert looked up. Nella was standing silent at the foot of the bed, her\neyes moist. She came round to the bedside, and put her hand on the\npatient's heart. Scarcely could she feel its pulsation, and to Aribert\nher eyes expressed a sudden despair.\n\nAt that moment Hans re-entered the room and beckoned to her.\n\n'I have heard that Herr Racksole has returned to the h\u00c3\u00b4tel,' he\nwhispered, 'and that he has captured that man Jules, who they say is\nsuch a villain.'\n\nSeveral times during the night Nella inquired for her father, but could\ngain no knowledge of his whereabouts. Now, at half-past six in the\nmorning, a rumour had mysteriously spread among the servants of the\nh\u00c3\u00b4tel about the happenings of the night before. How it had originated no\none could have determined, but it had originated.\n\n'Where is my father?' Nella asked of Hans.\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders, and pointed upwards. 'Somewhere at the top,\nthey say.'\n\nNella almost ran out of the room. Her interruption of the interview\nbetween Jules and Theodore Racksole has already been described. As she\ncame downstairs with her father she said again, 'Prince Eugen is dying--\nbut I think you can save him.'\n\n'I?' exclaimed Theodore.\n\n'Yes,' she repeated positively. 'I will tell you what I want you to do,\nand you must do it.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Twenty-Nine THEODORE IS CALLED TO THE RESCUE\n\nAS Nella passed downstairs from the top storey with her father--the\nlifts had not yet begun to work--she drew him into her own room, and\nclosed the door.\n\n'What's this all about?' he asked, somewhat mystified, and even alarmed\nby the extreme seriousness of her face.\n\n'Dad,' the girl began, 'you are very rich, aren't you? very, very rich?'\nShe smiled anxiously, timidly. He did not remember to have seen that\nexpression on her face before. He wanted to make a facetious reply, but\nchecked himself.\n\n'Yes,' he said, 'I am. You ought to know that by this time.'\n\n'How soon could you realize a million pounds?'\n\n'A million--what?' he cried. Even he was staggered by her calm reference\nto this gigantic sum. 'What on earth are you driving at?'\n\n'A million pounds, I said. That is to say, five million dollars. How\nsoon could you realize as much as that?'\n\n'Oh!' he answered, 'in about a month, if I went about it neatly enough.\nI could unload as much as that in a month without scaring Wall Street\nand other places. But it would want some arrangement.'\n\n'Useless!' she exclaimed. 'Couldn't you do it quicker, if you really had\nto?'\n\n'If I really had to, I could fix it in a week, but it would make things\nlively, and I should lose on the job.'\n\n'Couldn't you,' she persisted, 'couldn't you go down this morning and\nraise a million, somehow, if it was a matter of life and death?'\n\nHe hesitated. 'Look here, Nella,' he said, 'what is it you've got up\nyour sleeve?'\n\n'Just answer my question, Dad, and try not to think that I'm a stark,\nstaring lunatic.'\n\n'I rather expect I could get a million this morning, even in London. But\nit would cost pretty dear. It might cost me fifty thousand pounds, and\nthere would be the dickens of an upset in New York--a sort of grand\nuniversal slump in my holdings.'\n\n'Why should New York know anything about it?'\n\n'Why should New York know anything about it!' he repeated. 'My girl,\nwhen anyone borrows a million sovereigns the whole world knows about it.\nDo you reckon that I can go up to the Governors of the Bank of England\nand say, \"Look here, lend Theodore Racksole a million for a few weeks,\nand he'll give you an IOU and a covering note on stocks\"?'\n\n'But you could get it?' she asked again.\n\n'If there's a million in London I guess I could handle it,' he replied.\n\n'Well, Dad,' and she put her arms round his neck, 'you've just got to go\nout and fix it. See? It's for me. I've never asked you for anything\nreally big before. But I do now. And I want it so badly.'\n\nHe stared at her. 'I award you the prize,' he said, at length. 'You\ndeserve it for colossal and immense coolness. Now you can tell me the\ntrue inward meaning of all this rigmarole. What is it?'\n\n'I want it for Prince Eugen,' she began, at first hesitatingly, with\npauses.\n\n'He's ruined unless he can get a million to pay off his debts. He's\ndreadfully in love with a Princess, and he can't marry her because of\nthis.\n\nHer parents wouldn't allow it. He was to have got it from Sampson Levi,\nbut he arrived too late--owing to Jules.'\n\n'I know all about that--perhaps more than you do. But I don't see how it\naffects you or me.'\n\n'The point is this, Dad,' Nella continued. 'He's tried to commit\nsuicide--he's so hipped. Yes, real suicide. He took laudanum last night.\nIt didn't kill him straight off--he's got over the first shock, but he's\nin a very weak state, and he means to die. And I truly believe he will\ndie. Now, if you could let him have that million, Dad, you would save\nhis life.'\n\nNella's item of news was a considerable and disconcerting surprise to\nRacksole, but he hid his feelings fairly well.\n\n'I haven't the least desire to save his life, Nell. I don't overmuch\nrespect your Prince Eugen. I've done what I could for him--but only for\nthe sake of seeing fair play, and because I object to conspiracies and\nsecret murders.\n\nIt's a different thing if he wants to kill himself. What I say is: Let\nhim.\n\nWho is responsible for his being in debt to the tune of a million\npounds? He's only got himself and his bad habits to thank for that. I\nsuppose if he does happen to peg out, the throne of Posen will go to\nPrince Aribert. And a good thing, too! Aribert is worth twenty of his\nnephew.'\n\n'That's just it, Dad,' she said, eagerly following up her chance. 'I\nwant you to save Prince Eugen just because Aribert--Prince Aribert--\ndoesn't wish to occupy the throne. He'd much prefer not to have it.'\n\n'Much prefer not to have it! Don't talk nonsense. If he's honest with\nhimself, he'll admit that he'll be jolly glad to have it. Thrones are in\nhis blood, so to speak.'\n\n'You are wrong, Father. And the reason is this: If Prince Aribert\nascended the throne of Posen he would be compelled to marry a Princess.'\n\n'Well! A Prince ought to marry a Princess.'\n\n'But he doesn't want to. He wants to give up all his royal rights, and\nlive as a subject. He wants to marry a woman who isn't a Princess.'\n\n'Is she rich?'\n\n'Her father is,' said the girl. 'Oh, Dad! can't you guess? He--he loves\nme.' Her head fell on Theodore's shoulder and she began to cry.\n\nThe millionaire whistled a very high note. 'Nell!' he said at length.\n'And you? Do you sort of cling to him?'\n\n'Dad,' she answered, 'you are stupid. Do you imagine I should worry\nmyself like this if I didn't?' She smiled through her tears. She knew\nfrom her father's tone that she had accomplished a victory.\n\n'It's a mighty queer arrangement,' Theodore remarked. 'But of course if\nyou think it'll be of any use, you had better go down and tell your\nPrince Eugen that that million can be fixed up, if he really needs it. I\nexpect there'll be decent security, or Sampson Levi wouldn't have mixed\nhimself up in it.'\n\n'Thanks, Dad. Don't come with me; I may manage better alone.'\n\nShe gave a formal little curtsey and disappeared. Racksole, who had the\ntalent, so necessary to millionaires, of attending to several matters at\nonce, the large with the small, went off to give orders about the\nbreakfast and the remuneration of his assistant of the evening before,\nMr George Hazell. He then sent an invitation to Mr Felix Babylon's room,\nasking that gentleman to take breakfast with him. After he had related\nto Babylon the history of Jules' capture, and had a long discussion with\nhim upon several points of h\u00c3\u00b4tel management, and especially as to the\nguarding of wine-cellars, Racksole put on his hat, sallied forth into\nthe Strand, hailed a hansom, and was driven to the City. The order and\nnature of his operations there were too complex and technical to be\ndescribed here.\n\nWhen Nella returned to the State bedroom both the doctor and the great\nspecialist were again in attendance. The two physicians moved away from\nthe bedside as she entered, and began to talk quietly together in the\nembrasure of the window.\n\n'A curious case!' said the specialist.\n\n'Yes. Of course, as you say, it's a neurotic temperament that's at the\nbottom of the trouble. When you've got that and a vigorous constitution\nworking one against the other, the results are apt to be distinctly\ncurious.\n\nDo you consider there is any hope, Sir Charles?'\n\n'If I had seen him when he recovered consciousness I should have said\nthere was hope. Frankly, when I left last night, or rather this morning,\nI didn't expect to see the Prince alive again--let alone conscious, and\nable to talk. According to all the rules of the game, he ought to get\nover the shock to the system with perfect ease and certainty. But I\ndon't think he will. I don't think he wants to. And moreover, I think he\nis still under the influence of suicidal mania. If he had a razor he\nwould cut his throat. You must keep his strength up. Inject, if\nnecessary. I will come in this afternoon. I am due now at St James's\nPalace.' And the specialist hurried away, with an elaborate bow and a\nfew hasty words of polite reassurances to Prince Aribert.\n\nWhen he had gone Prince Aribert took the other doctor aside. 'Forget\neverything, doctor,' he said, 'except that I am one man and you are\nanother, and tell me the truth. Shall you be able to save his Highness?\nTell me the truth.'\n\n'There is no truth,' was the doctor's reply. 'The future is not in our\nhands, Prince.'\n\n'But you are hopeful? Yes or no.'\n\nThe doctor looked at Prince Aribert. 'No!' he said shortly. 'I am not. I\nam never hopeful when the patient is not on my side.'\n\n'You mean--?'\n\n'I mean that his Royal Highness has no desire to live. You must have\nobserved that.'\n\n'Only too well,' said Aribert.\n\n'And you are aware of the cause?'\n\nAribert nodded an affirmative.\n\n'But cannot remove it?'\n\n'No,' said Aribert. He felt a touch on his sleeve. It was Nella's\nfinger.\n\nWith a gesture she beckoned him towards the ante-room.\n\n'If you choose,' she said, when they were alone, 'Prince Eugen can be\nsaved.\n\nI have arranged it.'\n\n'You have arranged it?' He bent over her, almost with an air of alarm.\n'Go and tell him that the million pounds which is so necessary to his\nhappiness will be forthcoming. Tell him that it will be forthcoming\ntoday, if that will be any satisfaction to him.'\n\n'But what do you mean by this, Nella?'\n\n'I mean what I say, Aribert,' and she sought his hand and took it in\nhers.\n\n'Just what I say. If a million pounds will save Prince Eugen's life, it\nis at his disposal.'\n\n'But how--how have you managed it? By what miracle?'\n\n'My father,' she replied softly, 'will do anything that I ask him. Do\nnot let us waste time. Go and tell Eugen it is arranged, that all will\nbe well.\n\nGo!'\n\n'But we cannot accept this--this enormous, this incredible favour. It is\nimpossible.'\n\n'Aribert,' she said quickly, 'remember you are not in Posen holding a\nCourt reception. You are in England and you are talking to an American\ngirl who has always been in the habit of having her own way.'\n\nThe Prince threw up his hands and went back in to the bedroom. The\ndoctor was at a table writing out a prescription. Aribert approached the\nbedside, his heart beating furiously. Eugen greeted him with a faint,\nfatigued smile.\n\n'Eugen,' he whispered, 'listen carefully to me. I have news. With the\nassistance of friends I have arranged to borrow that million for you. It\nis quite settled, and you may rely on it. But you must get better. Do\nyou hear me?'\n\nEugen almost sat up in bed. 'Tell me I am not delirious,' he exclaimed.\n\n'Of course you aren't,' Aribert replied. 'But you mustn't sit up. You\nmust take care of yourself.'\n\n'Who will lend the money?' Eugen asked in a feeble, happy whisper.\n\n'Never mind. You shall hear later. Devote yourself now to getting\nbetter.'\n\nThe change in the patient's face was extraordinary. His mind seemed to\nhave put on an entirely different aspect. The doctor was startled to\nhear him murmur a request for food. As for Aribert, he sat down,\novercome by the turmoil of his own thoughts. Till that moment he felt\nthat he had never appreciated the value and the marvellous power of mere\nmoney, of the lucre which philosophers pretend to despise and men sell\ntheir souls for. His heart almost burst in its admiration for that\nextraordinary Nella, who by mere personal force had raised two men out\nof the deepest slough of despair to the blissful heights of hope and\nhappiness. 'These Anglo-Saxons,' he said to himself, 'what a race!'\n\nBy the afternoon Eugen was noticeably and distinctly better. The\nphysicians, puzzled for the third time by the progress of the case,\nannounced now that all danger was past. The tone of the announcement\nseemed to Aribert to imply that the fortunate issue was due wholly to\nunrivalled medical skill, but perhaps Aribert was mistaken. Anyhow, he\nwas in a most charitable mood, and prepared to forgive anything.\n\n'Nella,' he said a little later, when they were by themselves again in\nthe ante-chamber, 'what am I to say to you? How can I thank you? How can\nI thank your father?'\n\n'You had better not thank my father,' she said. 'Dad will affect to\nregard the thing as a purely business transaction, as, of course, it is.\nAs for me, you can--you can--'\n\n'Well?'\n\n'Kiss me,' she said. 'There! Are you sure you've formally proposed to\nme, mon prince?'\n\n'Ah! Nell!' he exclaimed, putting his arms round her again. 'Be mine!\nThat is all I want!'\n\n'You'll find,' she said, 'that you'll want Dad's consent too!'\n\n'Will he make difficulties? He could not, Nell--not with you!'\n\n'Better ask him,' she said sweetly.\n\nA moment later Racksole himself entered the room. 'Going on all right?'\nhe enquired, pointing to the bedroom. 'Excellently,' the lovers answered\ntogether, and they both blushed.\n\n'Ah!' said Racksole. 'Then, if that's so, and you can spare a minute,\nI've something to show you, Prince.'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Thirty CONCLUSION\n\n'I'VE a great deal to tell you, Prince,' Racksole began, as soon as they\nwere out of the room, 'and also, as I said, something to show you. Will\nyou come to my room? We will talk there first. The whole h\u00c3\u00b4tel is\nhumming with excitement.'\n\n'With pleasure,' said Aribert.\n\n'Glad his Highness Prince Eugen is recovering,' Racksole said, urged by\nconsiderations of politeness.\n\n'Ah! As to that--' Aribert began. 'If you don't mind, we'll discuss that\nlater, Prince,' Racksole interrupted him.\n\nThey were in the proprietor's private room.\n\n'I want to tell you all about last night,' Racksole resumed, 'about my\ncapture of Jules, and my examination of him this morning.' And he\nlaunched into a full account of the whole thing, down to the least\ndetails. 'You see,' he concluded, 'that our suspicions as to Bosnia were\ntolerably correct. But as regards Bosnia, the more I think about it, the\nsurer I feel that nothing can be done to bring their criminal\npoliticians to justice.'\n\n'And as to Jules, what do you propose to do?'\n\n'Come this way,' said Racksole, and led Aribert to another room. A sofa\nin this room was covered with a linen cloth. Racksole lifted the cloth--\nhe could never deny himself a dramatic moment--and disclosed the body of\na dead man.\n\nIt was Jules, dead, but without a scratch or mark on him.\n\n'I have sent for the police--not a street constable, but an official\nfrom Scotland Yard,' said Racksole.\n\n'How did this happen?' Aribert asked, amazed and startled. 'I understood\nyou to say that he was safely immured in the bedroom.'\n\n'So he was,' Racksole replied. 'I went up there this afternoon, chiefly\nto take him some food. The commissionaire was on guard at the door. He\nhad heard no noise, nothing unusual. Yet when I entered the room Jules\nwas gone.\n\nHe had by some means or other loosened his fastenings; he had then\nmanaged to take the door off the wardrobe. He had moved the bed in front\nof the window, and by pushing the wardrobe door three parts out of the\nwindow and lodging the inside end of it under the rail at the head of\nthe bed, he had provided himself with a sort of insecure platform\noutside the window. All this he did without making the least sound. He\nmust then have got through the window, and stood on the little platform.\nWith his fingers he would just be able to reach the outer edge of the\nwide cornice under the roof of the h\u00c3\u00b4tel. By main strength of arms he\nhad swung himself on to this cornice, and so got on to the roof proper.\nHe would then have the run of the whole roof.\n\nAt the side of the building facing Salisbury Lane there is an iron fire-\nescape, which runs right down from the ridge of the roof into a little\nsunk yard level with the cellars. Jules must have thought that his\nescape was accomplished. But it unfortunately happened that one rung in\nthe iron escape-ladder had rusted rotten through being badly painted. It\ngave way, and Jules, not expecting anything of the kind, fell to the\nground. That was the end of all his cleverness and ingenuity.'\n\nAs Racksole ceased, speaking he replaced the linen cloth with a gesture\nfrom which reverence was not wholly absent.\n\nWhen the grave had closed over the dark and tempestuous career of Tom\nJackson, once the pride of the Grand Babylon, there was little trouble\nfor the people whose adventures we have described. Miss Spencer, that\nyellow-haired, faithful slave and attendant of a brilliant scoundrel,\nwas never heard of again. Possibly to this day she survives, a mystery\nto her fellow-creatures, in the pension of some cheap foreign boarding-\nhouse. As for Rocco, he certainly was heard of again. Several years\nafter the events set down, it came to the knowledge of Felix Babylon\nthat the unrivalled Rocco had reached Buenos Aires, and by his culinary\nskill was there making the fortune of a new and splendid h\u00c3\u00b4tel. Babylon\ntransmitted the information to Theodore Racksole, and Racksole might,\nhad he chosen, have put the forces of the law in motion against him. But\nRacksole, seeing that everything pointed to the fact that Rocco was now\npursuing his vocation honestly, decided to leave him alone. The one\ndifficulty which Racksole experienced after the demise of Jules--and it\nwas a difficulty which he had, of course, anticipated--was connected\nwith the police. The police, very properly, wanted to know things. They\ndesired to be informed what Racksole had been doing in the Dimmock\naffair, between his first visit to Ostend and his sending for them to\ntake charge of Jules' dead body. And Racksole was by no means inclined\nto tell them everything. Beyond question he had transgressed the laws of\nEngland, and possibly also the laws of Belgium; and the moral excellence\nof his motives in doing so was, of course, in the eyes of legal justice,\nno excuse for such conduct. The inquest upon Jules aroused some bother;\nand about ninety-and-nine separate and distinct rumours. In the end,\nhowever, a compromise was arrived at. Racksole's first aim was to pacify\nthe inspector whose clue, which by the way was a false one, he had so\ncurtly declined to follow up. That done, the rest needed only tact and\npatience. He proved to the satisfaction of the authorities that he had\nacted in a perfectly honest spirit, though with a high hand, and that\nsubstantial justice had been done. Also, he subtly indicated that, if it\ncame to the point, he should defy them to do their worst. Lastly, he was\nable, through the medium of the United States Ambassador, to bring\ncertain soothing influences to bear upon the situation.\n\nOne afternoon, a fortnight after the recovery of the Hereditary Prince\nof Posen, Aribert, who was still staying at the Grand Babylon, expressed\na wish to hold converse with the millionaire. Prince Eugen, accompanied\nby Hans and some Court officials whom he had sent for, had departed with\nimmense \u00c3\u00a9clat, armed with the comfortable million, to arrange formally\nfor his betrothal.\n\nTouching the million, Eugen had given satisfactory personal security,\nand the money was to be paid off in fifteen years.\n\n'You wish to talk to me, Prince,' said Racksole to Aribert, when they\nwere seated together in the former's room.\n\n'I wish to tell you,' replied Aribert, 'that it is my intention to\nrenounce all my rights and titles as a Royal Prince of Posen, and to be\nknown in future as Count Hartz--a rank to which I am entitled through my\nmother.\n\nAlso that I have a private income of ten thousand pounds a year, and a\nch\u00c3\u00a2teau and a town house in Posen. I tell you this because I am here to\nask the hand of your daughter in marriage. I love her, and I am vain\nenough to believe that she loves me. I have already asked her to be my\nwife, and she has consented. We await your approval.'\n\n'You honour us, Prince,' said Racksole with a slight smile, 'and in more\nways than one. May I ask your reason for renouncing your princely\ntitles?'\n\n'Simply because the idea of a morganatic marriage would be as repugnant\nto me as it would be to yourself and to Nella.'\n\n'That is good.' The Prince laughed. 'I suppose it has occurred to you\nthat ten thousand pounds per annum, for a man in your position, is a\nsomewhat small income. Nella is frightfully extravagant. I have known\nher to spend sixty thousand dollars in a single year, and have nothing\nto show for it at the end. Why! she would ruin you in twelve months.'\n\n'Nella must reform her ways,' Aribert said.\n\n'If she is content to do so,' Racksole went on, 'well and good! I\nconsent.'\n\n'In her name and my own, I thank you,' said Aribert gravely.\n\n'And,' the millionaire continued, 'so that she may not have to reform\ntoo fiercely, I shall settle on her absolutely, with reversion to your\nchildren, if you have any, a lump sum of fifty million dollars, that is\nto say, ten million pounds, in sound, selected railway stock. I reckon\nthat is about half my fortune. Nella and I have always shared equally.'\n\nAribert made no reply. The two men shook hands in silence, and then it\nhappened that Nella entered the room.\n\nThat night, after dinner, Racksole and his friend Felix Babylon were\nwalking together on the terrace of the Grand Babylon H\u00c3\u00b4tel.\n\nFelix had begun the conversation.\n\n'I suppose, Racksole,' he had said, 'you aren't getting tired of the\nGrand Babylon?'\n\n'Why do you ask?'\n\n'Because I am getting tired of doing without it. A thousand times since\nI sold it to you I have wished I could undo the bargain. I can't bear\nidleness. Will you sell?'\n\n'I might,' said Racksole, 'I might be induced to sell.'\n\n'What will you take, my friend?' asked Felix\n\n'What I gave,' was the quick answer.\n\n'Eh!' Felix exclaimed. 'I sell you my h\u00c3\u00b4tel with Jules, with Rocco, with\nMiss Spencer. You go and lose all those three inestimable servants, and\nthen offer me the h\u00c3\u00b4tel without them at the same price! It is\nmonstrous.' The little man laughed heartily at his own wit.\n'Nevertheless,' he added, 'we will not quarrel about the price. I accept\nyour terms.'\n\nAnd so was brought to a close the complex chain of events which had\nbegun when Theodore Racksole ordered a steak and a bottle of Bass at the\ntable d'h\u00c3\u00b4te of the Grand Babylon H\u00c3\u00b4tel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Grand Babylon Hotel, by Arnold Bennett\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE GRAND BABYLON HOTEL ***\n\n***** This file should be named 2813-8.txt or 2813-8.zip ***** This and\nall associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/2\/8\/1\/2813\/\n\nProduced by David Reed, and David Widger\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will be\nrenamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no one\nowns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and\nyou!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission\nand without paying copyright royalties.

In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the\nnumber of public domain and licensed works that can be freely\ndistributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of\nequipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to\n$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with\nthe IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations where\nwe have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside\nthe United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other ways\nincluding checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,\nplease visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless\na copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks\nin compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including\nhow to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to\nour email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n\n","id":749,"split":"train"}
