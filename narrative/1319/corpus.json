{"ori_id":"9fb690b50942bf56dea7067546a01298376a3344","title":"Source Code","context":"Source Code\n U.S. Army pilot Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal), last aware of being on a mission in Afghanistan, wakes up on a commuter train to Chicago, at 7:40 am. To the world around him \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including his traveling partner Christina Warren (Michelle Monaghan) and the bathroom mirror \u00e2\u0080\u0093 he appears to be Sean Fentress, a school teacher. As he comes to grips with this revelation, the train explodes, killing everyone aboard.\nStevens regains consciousness inside a dingy dim cockpit, leaking oil. Communicating through a video screen, Air Force Captain Colleen Goodwin (Vera Farmiga) verifies Stevens' identity, and insists he stay \"on mission\" to find the bomber before a large \"dirty bomb\" hits downtown Chicago in six hours. Inside the \"Source Code\" experimental device designed by scientist Dr. Rutledge (Jeffrey Wright), he experiences the last eight minutes of another compatible person's life within an alternative timeline.\nStevens is unwillingly sent back into the Source Code repeatedly in frustrating, exhausting attempts to learn the bomber's identity. He tries to warn authorities on the train and flee with Christina, escaping the explosion. Other times he cannot locate or disarm the bomb and dies on the train. But Rutledge insists the alternate timeline is not real. It is revealed that he has been \"with them\" for two months since being reported killed in action in Afghanistan. He is comatose and missing most of his body, hooked up to neural sensors. The cockpit capsule is in his imagination, his brain's way of making sense of a missing environment. A confused and frustrated Stevens asks, \"As one soldier to another, am I dead?\" Angry to learn that he is on life support, he asks to be disconnected after the mission. Rutledge agrees.\nStevens catches the bomber Derek Frost (Michael Arden), who leaves his wallet behind to fake his own death, and gets off at the last stop before Chicago. In one run-through, Frost kills both Fentress and Christina, and flees in a rented white van. Stevens remembers the license number and direction and the authorities use this information to catch the terrorist, preventing him from detonating the dirty bomb. The mission finished, Rutledge reneges on his promise, ordering Goodwin to wipe Stevens' memory for a future mission. Stevens convinces Goodwin to allow one more try, to save everyone on the train, despite Rutledge's insistence that everyone on the train had already been killed in the explosion.\nStevens is sent back into the Source Code where he disarms the bomb, subdues Frost and handcuffs him to a handrail inside the train. He reports the bomber to authorities, sends an email to Captain Goodwin, then calls to reconcile with his estranged father under the guise of a fellow soldier. He asks Christina what she would do if she knew that she only had seconds left to live, and starts to kiss her. At the same time, Goodwin approaches the air-tight chamber that contains the torso of Stevens' comatose mutilated body, disconnects the life support, and Stevens dies. Rutledge bangs on the outer door in vain. The scene cuts to Stevens finishing the kiss with Christina inside the Source Code, revealing that the alternate timeline of the Source Code has become real, contrary to what was proposed by Rutledge. They continue on the train, and then walk through downtown Chicago to the Cloud Gate, a sculpture whose image Stevens saw during transitions out of the Source Code. This prompts Stevens to ask Christina \"Do you believe in fate?\" As they stand in front of the mirrored sculpture, Stevens' reflection in the Cloud Gate is seen to be the image of Sean Fentress.\nWhen the alternative-timeline Goodwin arrives for work at Nellis Air Force Base that morning, she receives the email from Stevens. While news breaks about the failed bomber on the Chicago train, the email informs Goodwin that they have changed history, and Goodwin seemingly recalls something. The email asks her to reassure this timeline's Stevens that \"everything is gonna be okay\". The scene cuts to Stevens who, in this timeline, is still comatose, hooked up to the neural sensors in the airtight chamber.\n<html>\n<head><title>Source Code Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Source Code script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Source Code script, Source Code movie script, Source Code film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

HIGH SPEED TRAIN - MORNING\n<\/b>\n          COLTER jolts awake. Sunlight hits his face.\n          He blinks. A stunned beat. He's disoriented.\n          Slowly he turns his head to one side...\n          PASSENGERS. Filling most of the seats. Office workers on\n          their morning commute into a city.\n          Turning the other way, he's confronted with a window. Trees\n          flash by, splitting the rising sunlight into a hypnotic\n          strobe pattern.\n          Colter looks to be thirty years old. A military buzz cut. A\n          disciplined physique, lean and spare, almost gaunt. Skin\n          burnished by years of desert sandstorms and equatorial sun.\n          His expression, prematurely aged by combat, is perpetually\n          wary, sometimes predatory, accustomed to trouble.\n          Despite his military bearing, Colter wears a button down\n          shirt and navy sports coat. On his wrist is a digital watch.\n          It reads 7:40 a.m.\n          He swallows. A strange, creeping panic.\n          He has no idea where he is.\n\n<b>          EXT.

A\n          red APPLE rolls against two LIBRARY BOOKS. The bag's leather\n          NAME TAG reads: \"SEAN FENTRESS.\"\u009d\n          It's not coming back to him. This whole experience is\n          starting to freak him out.\n          He catches the scent of something. A passenger walks by with\n          a STEAMING CUP OF COFFEE.\n          CHK-THOCK! Two rows back, an OVERWEIGHT MAN opens a can of\n          soda.\n          Sitting opposite Colter, facing him, is a WOMAN in her late\n          twenties (CHRISTINA). In contrast to the corporate suits\n          around her, her appearance is thrift store funky: black nail\n          polish, dark lipstick, black hair with blue streaks, a button-\n          down blouse edged in black funeral lace with silver skull-and-\n          bones cufflinks.

It's a mirror image of the first car. But no,\n          the passengers are different.\n          Beside him there's a small door. Thinking it's the bathroom,\n          he instead opens it to find a CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT. A\n          cramped office with chairs and surveillance monitors.\n\n<b>                         CONDUCTOR\n<\/b>          Ticket?\n          A heavy-set CONDUCTOR stands in the aisle.
