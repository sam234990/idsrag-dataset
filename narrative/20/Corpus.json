{"ori_id":"05000d20b404b4f3c6c34127dc3836fecad8f134","title":"The Belle's Stratagem","context":"The Belle's Stratagem\n The play's double plotline concerns the romance between Letitia Hardy and Doricourt, as well as the relationship between Sir George Touchwood and his wife, Lady Frances Touchwood. The story comes to a d\u0102\u0160nouement at the masquerade ball of the last act. As described by the press office of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival,\n\"Set in 1780s London, The Belle's Stratagem is the tale of Letitia Hardy, promised to the charming Doricourt whom she hasn't seen since childhood. Her plan to enchant him with her wit and charm is turned upside-down when she discovers she's fallen madly in love with him, and he seems quite unmoved by her. Desiring to marry a man who adores her equally, she plans a bold deception--to have love as she likes it. Interwoven with Letitia's scheme to trick Doricourt into passion is the story of the newly married Touchwoods. Sir George is wildly jealous of his lovely country-bred wife and his fear of her being corrupted by fashionable life encourages plots by his acquaintance to turn Lady Frances into a fine lady in order to spite Sir George.\"\nThe role of the ingenue heroine, Letitia Hardy, proved to be a successful vehicle in Paris for Harriet Smithson, who infatuated Hector Berlioz. It was also \"a favorite role\" for Ellen Terry, who was both photographed and engraved in her character's costume.\nCharacters include...\nKitty Willis,\nTony,\nSaville,\nCourtall,\nDoricourt,\nFlutter,\nVillers,\nMrs. Racket,\nLetitia Hardy,\nOld Hardy,\nSir George Touchwood,\nMiss Ogle,\nLady Frances Touchwood\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg eBook, The Belle's Stratagem, by Hannah Cowley\n\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most\nother parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions \nwhatsoever.

And your wisdom never enquired at whose chambers?\n\n_Serv._ Sir, you spoke to the servant yourself.\n\n_Sav._ If I was too impatient to ask questions, you ought to have taken\ndirections, blockhead!\n\n      _Enter_ Courtall _singing_.\n\nHa, Courtall!--Bid him keep the horses in motion, and then enquire at\nall the chambers round. [_Exit servant._\n\nWhat the devil brings you to this part of the town?--Have any of the\nLong Robes, handsome wives, sisters or chambermaids?\n\n_Court._ Perhaps they have;--but I came on a different errand; and, had\nthy good fortune brought thee here half an hour sooner, I'd have given\nthee such a treat, ha! ha! ha!\n\n_Sav._ I'm sorry I miss'd it: what was it?\n\n_Court._ I was informed a few days since, that my cousins Fallow were\ncome to town, and desired earnestly to see me at their lodgings in\nWarwick-Court, Holborn. Away drove I, painting them all the way as so\nmany Hebes. They came from the farthest part of Northumberland, had\nnever been in town, and in course were made up of rusticity, innocence,\nand beauty.\n\n_Sav._ Well!\n\n_Court._ After waiting thirty minutes, during which there was a violent\nbustle, in bounced five fallow damsels, four of them maypoles;--the\nfifth, Nature, by way of variety, had bent in the \u00c3\u0086sop style.--But\nthey all opened at once, like hounds on a fresh scent:--\"Oh, cousin\nCourtall!--How do you do, cousin Courtall! Lord, cousin, I am glad you\nare come! We want you to go with us to the Park, and the Plays, and the\nOpera, and Almack's, and all the fine places!\"----The devil, thought I,\nmy dears, may attend you, for I am sure I won't.--However, I heroically\nstayed an hour with them, and discovered, the virgins were all come to\ntown with the hopes of leaving it--Wives:--their heads full of\nKnight-Baronights, Fops, and adventures.\n\n_Sav._ Well, how did you get off?\n\n_Court._ Oh, pleaded a million engagements.----However, conscience\ntwitched me; so I breakfasted with them this morning, and afterwards\n'squired them to the gardens here, as the most private place in town;\nand then took a sorrowful leave, complaining of my hard, hard fortune,\nthat obliged me to set off immediately for Dorsetshire, ha! ha! ha!\n\n_Sav._ I congratulate your escape!--Courtall at Almack's, with five\naukward country cousins! ha! ha! ha!--Why, your existence, as a Man of\nGallantry, could never have survived it.\n\n_Court._ Death, and fire! had they come to town, like the rustics of\nthe last age, to see Paul's, the Lions, and the Wax-work--at their\nservice;--but the cousins of our days come up Ladies--and, with the\nknowledge they glean from magazines and pocket-books, Fine Ladies;\nlaugh at the bashfulness of their grandmothers, and boldly demand their\n_entr\u00c3\u00a9es_ in the first circles.\n\n_Sav._ Where can this fellow be!--Come, give me some news--I have been\nat war with woodcocks and partridges these two months, and am a stranger\nto all that has passed out of their region.\n\n_Court._ Oh! enough for three Gazettes. The Ladies are going to petition\nfor a bill, that, during the war, every man may be allowed Two Wives.\n\n_Sav._ 'Tis impossible they should succeed, for the majority of both\nHouses know what it is to have one.\n\n_Court._ Gallantry was black-ball'd at the _Coterie_ last Thursday, and\nPrudence and Chastity voted in.\n\n_Sav._ Ay, that may hold 'till the Camps break up.--But have ye no\nelopements? no divorces?\n\n_Court._ Divorces are absolutely out, and the Commons-Doctors starving;\nso they are publishing trials of _Crim. Con._ with all the separate\nevidences at large; which they find has always a wonderful effect on\ntheir trade, actions tumbling in upon them afterwards, like mackarel at\nGravesend.\n\n_Sav._ What more?\n\n_Court._ Nothing--for weddings, deaths, and politics, I never talk of,\nbut whilst my hair is dressing. But prithee, Saville, how came you\nin town, whilst all the qualified gentry are playing at pop-gun on\nCoxheath, and the country over-run with hares and foxes?\n\n_Sav._ I came to meet my friend Doricourt, who, you know, is lately\narrived from Rome.\n\n_Court._ Arrived! Yes, faith, and has cut us all out!--His carriage,\nhis liveries, his dress, himself, are the rage of the day! His first\nappearance set the whole _Ton_ in a ferment, and his valet is besieged\nby _lev\u00c3\u00a9es_ of taylors, habit-makers, and other Ministers of Fashion, to\ngratify the impatience of their customers for becoming _\u00c3\u00a0 la mode de\nDoricourt_. Nay, the beautiful Lady Frolic, t'other night, with two\nsister Countesses, insisted upon his waistcoat for muffs; and their\nsnowy arms now bear it in triumph about town, to the heart-rending\naffliction of all our _Beaux Gar\u00c3\u00a7ons_.\n\n_Sav._ Indeed! Well, those little gallantries will soon be over; he's on\nthe point of marriage.\n\n_Court._ Marriage! Doricourt on the point of marriage! 'Tis the happiest\ntidings you could have given, next to his being hanged--Who is the Bride\nelect?\n\n_Sav._ I never saw her; but 'tis Miss Hardy, the rich heiress--the match\nwas made by the parents, and the courtship begun on their nurses knees;\nMaster used to crow at Miss, and Miss used to chuckle at Master.\n\n_Court._ Oh! then by this time they care no more for each other, than I\ndo for my country cousins.\n\n_Sav._ I don't know that; they have never met since thus high, and so,\nprobably, have some regard for each other.\n\n_Court._ Never met! Odd!\n\n_Sav._ A whim of Mr. Hardy's; he thought his daughter's charms would\nmake a more forcible impression, if her lover remained in ignorance of\nthem 'till his return from the Continent.\n\n      _Enter_ Saville's _Servant_.\n\n_Serv._ Mr. Doricourt, Sir, has been at Counsellor Pleadwell's, and gone\nabout five minutes. [_Exit Servant._\n\n_Serv._ Five minutes! Zounds! I have been five minutes too late all my\nlife-time!--Good morrow, Courtall; I must pursue him. (_Going._)\n\n_Court._ Promise to dine with me to-day; I have some honest fellows.\n(_Going off on the opposite side._)\n\n_Sav._ Can't promise; perhaps I may.--See there, there's a bevy of\nfemale Patagonians, coming down upon us.\n\n_Court._ By the Lord, then, it must be my strapping cousins.--I dare not\nlook behind me--Run, man, run. [_Exit, on the same side._\n\n\nSCENE II.--_A Hall at_ Doricourt'_s_. (_A gentle knock at the door._)\n\n_Enter the Porter._\n\n_Port._ Tap! What sneaking devil art thou? (_Opens the door._)\n\n      _Enter_ Crowquill.\n\nSo! I suppose _you_ are one of Monsieur's customers too? He's above\nstairs, now, overhauling all his Honour's things to a parcel of 'em.\n\n_Crowq._ No, Sir; it is with you, if you please, that I want to speak.\n\n_Port._ Me! Well, what do you want with me?\n\n_Crowq._ Sir, you must know that I am--I am the Gentleman who writes the\n_T\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aates_ in the Magazines.\n\n_Port._ Oh, oh!--What, you are the fellow that ties folks together, in\nyour sixpenny cuts, that never meet any where else?\n\n_Crowq._ Oh, dear Sir, excuse me!--we always go on _foundation_; and\nif you can help me to a few anecdotes of your master, such as what\nMarchioness he lost money to, in Paris--who is his favourite Lady in\ntown--or the name of the Girl he first made love to at College--or any\nincidents that happened to his Grandmother, or Great aunts--a couple\nwill do, by way of supporters--I'll weave a web of intrigues, losses,\nand gallantries, between them, that shall fill four pages, procure me a\ndozen dinners, and you, Sir, a bottle of wine for your trouble.\n\n_Port._ Oh, oh! I heard the butler talk of you, when I lived at Lord\nTinket's. But what the devil do you mean by a bottle of wine!--You gave\nhim a crown for a retaining fee.\n\n_Crowq._ Oh, Sir, that was for a Lord's amours; a Commoner's are never\nbut half. Why, I have had a Baronet's for five shillings, though he was\na married man, and changed his mistress every six weeks.\n\n_Port._ Don't tell me! What signifies a Baronet, or a bit of a Lord,\nwho, may be, was never further than sun and fun round London? _We_ have\ntravelled, man! My master has been in Italy, and over the whole island\nof Spain; talked to the Queen of France, and danced with her at a\nmasquerade. Ay, and such folks don't go to masquerades for nothing; but\nmum--not a word more--Unless you'll rank my master with a Lord, I'll not\nbe guilty of blabbing his secrets, I assure you.\n\n_Crowq._ Well, Sir, perhaps you'll throw in a hint or two of other\nfamilies, where you've lived, that may be worked up into something; and\nso, Sir, here is one, two, three, four, five shillings.\n\n_Port._ Well, that's honest, (_pocketing the money._) To tell you the\ntruth, I don't know much of my master's concerns yet;--but here comes\nMonsieur and his gang: I'll pump them: they have trotted after him all\nround Europe, from the Canaries to the Isle of Wight.\n\n      _Enter several foreign Servants and two Tradesmen._\n\n      (_The Porter takes one of them aside._)\n\n_Tradesm._ Well then, you have shew'd us all?\n\n_Frenchm._ All, _en v\u00c3\u00a9rit\u00c3\u00a9, Messieurs_! you _avez_ seen every ting.\n_Serviteur, serviteur._ [_Exeunt_ Tradesmen.\n\nAh, here comes one _autre_ curious Englishman, and dat's one _autre_\nguinea _pour moi_.\n\n      _Enter_ Saville.\n\n_Allons, Monsieur_, dis way; I will shew you tings, such tings you\nnever see, begar, in England!--velvets by Le Mosse, suits cut by Verdue,\ntrimmings by Grossette, embroidery by Detanville----\n\n_Sav._ Puppy!--where is your Master?\n\n_Port._ Zounds! you chattering frog-eating dunderhead, can't you see a\nGentleman?--'Tis Mr. Saville.\n\n_Frenchm._ Monsieur Saville! _Je suis mort de peur._--Ten tousand\npardons! _Excusez mon erreur_, and permit me you conduct to Monsieur\nDoricourt; he be too happy _\u00c3\u00a0 vous voir_. [_Exeunt_ Frenchman _and_\nSaville.\n\n_Port._ Step below a bit;--we'll make it out some-how!--I suppose a\nslice of sirloin won't make the story go down the worse. [_Exeunt_\nPorter _and_ Crowquill.\n\n\nSCENE III.----_An Apartment at_ Doricourt'_s_.\n\n_Enter_ Doricourt.\n\n_Doric._ (_speaking to a servant behind_) I shall be too late for St.\nJames's; bid him come immediately.\n\n      _Enter_ Frenchman _and_ Saville.\n\n_Frenchm._ Monsieur Saville. [_Exit_ Frenchman.\n\n_Doric._ Most fortunate! My dear Saville, let the warmth of this embrace\nspeak the pleasure of my heart.\n\n_Sav._ Well, this is some comfort, after the scurvy reception I met\nwith in your hall.--I prepared my mind, as I came up stairs, for a _bon\njour_, a grimace, and an _adieu_.\n\n_Doric._ Why so?\n\n_Sav._ Judging of the master from the rest of the family. What the devil\nis the meaning of that flock of foreigners below, with their parchment\nfaces and snuffy whiskers? What! can't an Englishman stand behind your\ncarriage, buckle your shoe, or brush your coat?\n\n_Doric._ Stale, my dear Saville, stale! Englishmen make the best\nSoldiers, Citizens, Artizans, and Philosophers in the world; but the\nvery worst Footmen. I keep French fellows and Germans, as the Romans\nkept slaves; because their own countrymen had minds too enlarged and\nhaughty to descend with a grace to the duties of such a station.\n\n_Sav._ A good excuse for a bad practice.\n\n_Doric._ On my honour, experience will convince you of its truth. A\nFrenchman neither hears, sees, nor breathes, but as his master directs;\nand his whole system of conduct is compris'd in one short word,\n_Obedience_! An Englishman reasons, forms opinions, cogitates, and\ndisputes; he is the mere creature of your will: the other, a being,\nconscious of equal importance in the universal scale with yourself, and\nis therefore your judge, whilst he wears your livery, and decides on\nyour actions with the freedom of a censor.\n\n_Sav._ And this in defence of a custom I have heard you execrate,\ntogether with all the adventitious manners imported by our Travell'd\nGentry.\n\n_Doric._ Ay, but that was at eighteen; we are always _very_ wise at\neighteen. But consider this point: we go into Italy, where the sole\nbusiness of the people is to study and improve the powers of Music: we\nyield to the fascination, and grow enthusiasts in the charming science:\nwe travel over France, and see the whole kingdom composing ornaments,\nand inventing Fashions: we condescend to avail ourselves of their\nindustry, and adopt their modes: we return to England, and find the\nnation intent on the most important objects; Polity, Commerce, War, with\nall the Liberal Arts, employ her sons; the latent sparks glow afresh\nwithin our bosoms; the sweet follies of the Continent imperceptibly\nslide away, whilst Senators, Statesmen, Patriots and Heroes, emerge from\nthe _virt\u00c3\u00bb_ of Italy, and the frippery of France.\n\n_Sav._ I may as well give it up! You had always the art of placing your\nfaults in the best light; and I can't help loving you, faults and all:\nso, to start a subject which must please you, When do you expect Miss\nHardy?\n\n_Doric._ Oh, the hour of expectation is past. She is arrived, and I this\nmorning had the honour of an interview at Pleadwell's. The writings were\nready; and, in obedience to the will of Mr. Hardy, we met to sign and\nseal.\n\n_Sav._ Has the event answered? Did your heart leap, or sink, when you\nbeheld your Mistress?\n\n_Doric._ Faith, neither one nor t'other; she's a fine girl, as far as\nmere flesh and blood goes.----But----\n\n_Sav._ But what?\n\n_Doric._ Why, she's _only_ a fine girl; complexion, shape, and features;\nnothing more.\n\n_Sav._ Is not that enough?\n\nDoric. No! she should have spirit! fire! _l'air enjou\u00c3\u00a9_! that something,\nthat nothing, which every body feels, and which no body can describe, in\nthe resistless charmers of Italy and France.\n\n_Sav._ Thanks to the parsimony of my father, that kept me from travel! I\nwould not have lost my relish for true unaffected English beauty, to\nhave been quarrell'd for by all the Belles of Versailles and Florence.\n\n_Doric._ Pho! thou hast no taste. _English_ beauty! 'Tis insipidity;\nit wants the zest, it wants poignancy, Frank! Why, I have known a\nFrenchwoman, indebted to nature for no one thing but a pair of decent\neyes, reckon in her suite as many Counts, Marquisses, and _Petits\nMa\u00c3\u00aetres_, as would satisfy three dozen of our first-rate toasts. I have\nknown an Italian _Marquizina_ make ten conquests in stepping from her\ncarriage, and carry her slaves from one city to another, whose real\nintrinsic beauty would have yielded to half the little _Grisettes_ that\npace your Mall on a Sunday.\n\n_Sav._ And has Miss Hardy nothing of this?\n\n_Doric._ If she has, she was pleased to keep it to herself. I was in\nthe room half an hour before I could catch the colour of her eyes; and\nevery attempt to draw her into conversation occasioned so cruel an\nembarrassment, that I was reduced to the necessity of news, French\nfleets, and Spanish captures, with her father.\n\n_Sav._ So Miss Hardy, with only beauty, modesty, and merit, is doom'd to\nthe arms of a husband who will despise her.\n\n_Doric._ You are unjust. Though she has not inspir'd me with violent\npassion, my honour secures her felicity.\n\n_Sav._ Come, come, Doricourt, you know very well that when the honour\nof a husband is _locum-tenens_ for his heart, his wife must be as\nindifferent as himself, if she is not unhappy.\n\n_Doric._ Pho! never moralise without spectacles. But, as we are upon the\ntender subject, how did you bear Touchwood's carrying Lady Frances?\n\n_Sav._ You know I never look'd up to her with hope, and Sir George is\nevery way worthy of her.\n\n_Doric._ _A la mode Angloise_, a philosopher even in love.\n\n_Sav._ Come, I detain you--you seem dress'd at all points, and of course\nhave an engagement.\n\n_Doric._ To St. James's. I dine at Hardy's, and accompany them to the\nmasquerade in the evening: but breakfast with me to-morrow, and we'll\ntalk of our old companions; for I swear to you, Saville, the air of the\nContinent has not effaced one youthful prejudice or attachment.\n\n_Sav._--With an exception to the case of Ladies and Servants.\n\n_Doric._ True; there I plead guilty:--but I have never yet found any man\nwhom I could cordially take to my heart, and call Friend, who was not\nborn beneath a British sky, and whose heart and manners were not truly\nEnglish. [_Exit_ Doricourt _and_ Saville.\n\n\nSCENE IV.--_An Apartment at Mr._ Hardy'_s_.\n\nVillers _seated on a sopha, reading_.\n\n_Enter_ Flutter.\n\n_Flut._ Hah, Villers, have you seen Mrs. Racket?----Miss Hardy, I find,\nis out.\n\n_Vill._ I have not seen her yet. I have made a voyage to Lapland since\nI came in. (_flinging away the book._) A Lady at her toilette is as\ndifficult to be moved, as a Quaker, (_yawning_). What events have\nhappened in the world since yesterday? have you heard?\n\n_Flut._ Oh, yes; I stopt at Tattersall's as I came by, and there I\nfound Lord James Jessamy, Sir William Wilding, and Mr.----. But, now\nI think of it, you sha'n't know a syllable of the matter; for I have\nbeen informed you never believe above one half of what I say.\n\n_Vill._ My dear fellow, somebody has imposed upon you most\negregiously!--Half! Why, I never believe one tenth part of what you\nsay; that is, according to the plain and literal expression: but, as I\nunderstand you, your intelligence is amusing.\n\n_Flut._ That's very hard now, very hard. I never related a falsity in\nmy life, unless I stumbled on it by mistake; and if it were otherwise,\nyour dull matter-of-fact people are infinitely oblig'd to those warm\nimaginations which soar into fiction to amuse you; for, positively, the\ncommon events of this little dirty world are not worth talking about,\nunless you embellish 'em!----Hah! here comes Mrs. Racket: Adieu to\nweeds, I see! All life!\n\n      _Enter Mrs._ Racket.\n\nEnter, Madam, in all your charms! Villers has been abusing your toilette\nfor keeping you so long; but I think we are much oblig'd to it, and so\nare you.\n\nMrs. _Rack._ How so, pray? Good-morning t'ye both. Here, here's a hand\na-piece for you. (_They kiss her hands._)\n\n_Flut._ How so! Because it has given you so many beauties.\n\nMrs. _Rack._ Delightful compliment! What do you think of that, Villers?\n\n_Vill._ That he and his compliments are alike--shewy, but won't bear\nexamining.----So you brought Miss Hardy to town last night?\n\nMrs. _Rack._ Yes, I should have brought her before, but I had a fall\nfrom my horse, that confined me a week.--I suppose in her heart she\nwished me hanged a dozen times an hour.\n\n_Flut._ Why?\n\nMrs. _Rack._ Had she not an expecting Lover in town all the time? She\nmeets him this morning at the Lawyer's.--I hope she'll charm him; she's\nthe sweetest girl in the world.\n\n_Vill._ Vanity, like murder, will out.--You have convinced me you think\nyourself more charming.\n\nMrs. _Rack._ How can that be?\n\n_Vill._ No woman ever praises another, unless she thinks herself\nsuperior in the very perfections she allows.\n\n_Flut._ Nor no man ever rails at the sex, unless he is conscious he\ndeserves their hatred.\n\nMrs. _Rack._ Thank ye, Flutter--I'll owe ye a _bouquet_ for that. I am\ngoing to visit the new-married Lady Frances Touchwood.--Who knows her\nhusband?\n\n_Flut._ Every body.\n\nMrs. _Rack._ Is there not something odd in his character?\n\n_Vill._ Nothing, but that he is passionately fond of his wife;--and so\npetulant is his love, that he open'd the cage of a favourite Bullfinch,\nand sent it to catch Butterflies, because she rewarded its song with her\nkisses.\n\nMrs. _Rack._ Intolerable monster! Such a brute deserves----\n\n_Vill._ Nay, nay, nay, nay, this is your sex now----Give a woman but\none stroke of character, off she goes, like a ball from a racket; sees\nthe whole man, marks him down for an angel or a devil, and so exhibits\nhim to her acquaintance.--This monster! this brute! is one of the\nworthiest fellows upon earth; sound sense, and a liberal mind; but\ndoats on his wife to such excess, that he quarrels with every thing\nshe admires, and is jealous of her tippet and nosegay.\n\nMrs. _Rack._ Oh, less love for me, kind Cupid! I can see no difference\nbetween the torment of such an affection, and hatred.\n\n_Flut._ Oh, pardon me, inconceivable difference, inconceivable; I see it\nas clearly as your bracelet. In the one case the husband would say, as\nMr. Snapper said t'other day, Zounds! Madam, do you suppose that _my_\ntable, and _my_ house, and _my_ pictures!--_A-propos, des Bottes._ There\nwas the divinest Plague of Athens sold yesterday at Langford's! the dead\nfigures so natural, you would have sworn they had been alive! Lord\nPrimrose bid Five hundred--Six, said Lady Carmine.--A thousand, said\nIngot the Nabob.--Down went the hammer.--A _rouleau_ for your bargain,\nsaid Sir Jeremy Jingle. And what answer do you think Ingot made him?\n\nMrs. _Racket._ Why, took the offer.\n\n_Flut._ Sir, I would oblige you, but I buy this picture to place in the\nnursery: the children have already got Whittington and his Cat; 'tis\njust this size, and they'll make good companions.\n\nMrs. _Rack._ Ha! ha! ha! Well, I protest that's just the way now--the\nNabobs and their wives outbid one at every sale, and the creatures have\nno more taste----\n\n_Vill._ There again! You forget this story is told by Flutter, who\nalways remembers every thing but the circumstances and the person he\ntalks about:--'twas Ingot who offer'd a _rouleau_ for the bargain, and\nSir Jeremy Jingle who made the reply.\n\n_Flut._ Egad, I believe you are right.--Well, the story is as good one\nway as t'other, you know. Good morning. I am going to Mrs. Crotchet's\nconcert, and in my way back shall make my bow at Sir George's.\n(_Going._)\n\n_Vill._ I'll venture every figure in your taylor's bill, you make some\nblunder there.\n\n_Flut._ (_turning back_) Done! My taylor's bill has not been paid these\ntwo years; and I'll open my mouth with as much care as Mrs. Bridget\nButton, who wears cork plumpers in each cheek, and never hazards more\nthan six words for fear of shewing them. [_Exit_ Flutter.\n\nMrs. _Rack._ 'Tis a good-natur'd insignificant creature! let in every\nwhere, and cared for no where.--There's Miss Hardy return'd from\nLincoln's-Inn:--she seems rather chagrin'd.\n\n_Vill._ Then I leave you to your communications.\n\n      _Enter_ Letitia, _followed by her Maid_.\n\nAdieu! I am rejoiced to see you so well, Madam! but I must tear myself\naway.\n\n_Letit._ Don't vanish in a moment.\n\n_Vill._ Oh, inhuman! you are two of the most dangerous women in\ntown.--Staying here to be cannonaded by four such eyes, is equal to\na _rencontre_ with Paul Jones, or a midnight march to Omoa!--They'll\nswallow the nonsense for the sake of the compliment. (_Aside._)\n[_Exit_ Villers.\n\n_Letit._ (_gives her cloak to her maid._) Order Du Quesne never to come\nagain; he shall positively dress my hair no more. [_Exit Maid._] And\nthis odious silk, how unbecoming it is!--I was bewitched to chuse it.\n(_Throwing herself on a sopha, and looking in a pocket-glass, Mrs._\nRacket _staring at her_.) Did you ever see such a fright as I am to-day?\n\nMrs. _Rack._ Yes, I have seen you look much worse.\n\n_Letit._ How can you be so provoking? If I do not look this morning\nworse than ever I look'd in my life, I am naturally a fright. You shall\nhave it which way you will.\n\nMrs. _Rack._ Just as you please; but pray what is the meaning of all\nthis?\n\n_Letit._ (_rising._) Men are all dissemblers! flatterers! deceivers!\nHave I not heard a thousand times of my air, my eyes, my shape--all\nmade for victory! and to-day, when I bent my whole heart on one poor\nconquest, I have proved that all those imputed charms amount to\nnothing;--for Doricourt saw them unmov'd.--A husband of fifteen months\ncould not have examined me with more cutting indifference.\n\nMrs. _Rack._ Then you return it like a wife of fifteen months, and be as\nindifferent as he.\n\n_Letit._ Aye, there's the sting! The blooming boy, who left his image in\nmy young heart, is at four and twenty improv'd in every grace that fix'd\nhim there. It is the same face that my memory, and my dreams, constantly\npainted to me; but its graces are finished, and every beauty heightened.\nHow mortifying, to feel myself at the same moment his slave, and an\nobject of perfect indifference to him!\n\nMrs. _Rack._ How are you certain that was the case? Did you expect him\nto kneel down before the lawyer, his clerks, and, your father, to make\noath of your beauty?\n\n_Letit._ No; but he should have look'd as if a sudden ray had pierced\nhim! he should have been breathless! speechless! for, oh! Caroline, all\nthis was I.\n\nMrs. _Rack._ I am sorry you was such a fool. Can you expect a man, who\nhas courted and been courted by half the fine women in Europe, to feel\nlike a girl from a boarding-school? He is the prettiest fellow you have\nseen, and in course bewilders your imagination; but he has seen a\nmillion of pretty women, child, before he saw you; and his first\nfeelings have been over long ago.\n\n_Letit._ Your raillery distresses me; but I will touch his heart, or\nnever be his wife.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Absurd, and romantic! If you have no reason to believe his\nheart pre-engaged, be satisfied; if he is a man of honour, you'll have\nnothing to complain of.\n\n_Letit._ Nothing to complain of! Heav'ns! shall I marry the man I adore,\nwith such an expectation as that?\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ And when you have fretted yourself pale, my dear, you'll\nhave mended your expectation greatly.\n\n_Letit._ (_pausing._) Yet I have one hope. If there is any power whose\npeculiar care is faithful love, that power I invoke to aid me.\n\n      _Enter Mr._ Hardy.\n\n_Hardy._ Well, now; wasn't I right? Aye, Letty! Aye, Cousin Racket!\nwasn't I right? I knew 'twould be so. He was all agog to see her before\nhe went abroad; and, if he had, he'd have thought no more of her face,\nmay be, than his own.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ May be, not half so much.\n\n_Hardy._ Aye, may be so:--but I see into things; exactly as I foresaw,\nto-day he fell desperately in love with the wench, he! he! he!\n\n_Letit._ Indeed, Sir! how did you perceive it?\n\n_Hardy._ That's a pretty question! How do I perceive every thing? How\ndid I foresee the fall of corn, and the rise of taxes? How did I know,\nthat if we quarrelled with America, Norway deals would be dearer? How\ndid I foretell that a war would sink the funds? How did I forewarn\nParson Homily, that if he didn't some way or other contrive to get more\nvotes than Rubrick, he'd lose the lectureship? How did I----But what the\ndevil makes you so dull, Letitia? I thought to have found you popping\nabout as brisk as the jacks of your harpsichord.\n\n_Letit._ Surely, Sir, 'tis a very serious occasion.\n\n_Hardy._ Pho, pho! girls should never be grave before marriage. How did\nyou feel, Cousin, beforehand? Aye!\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Feel! why exceedingly full of cares.\n\n_Hardy._ Did you?\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ I could not sleep for thinking of my coach, my liveries,\nand my chairmen; the taste of clothes I should be presented in,\ndistracted me for a week; and whether I should be married in white or\nlilac, gave me the most cruel anxiety.\n\n_Letit._ And is it possible that you felt no other care?\n\n_Hardy._ And pray, of what sort may your cares be, Mrs. Letitia? I begin\nto foresee now that you have taken a dislike to Doricourt.\n\n_Letit._ Indeed, Sir, I have not.\n\n_Hardy._ Then what's all this melancholy about? A'n't you going to be\nmarried? and, what's more, to a sensible man? and, what's more to a\nyoung girl, to a handsome man? And what's all this melancholy for, I\nsay?\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Why, because he _is_ handsome and sensible, and because\nshe's over head and ears in love with him; all which, it seems, your\nforeknowledge had not told you a word of.\n\n_Letit._ Fye, Caroline!\n\n_Hardy._ Well, come, do you tell me what's the matter then? If you\ndon't like him, hang the signing and sealing, he sha'n't have ye:--and\nyet I can't say that neither; for you know that estate, that cost his\nfather and me upwards of fourscore thousand pounds, must go all to him\nif you won't have him: if he won't have you, indeed, 'twill be all\nyours. All that's clear, engross'd upon parchment, and the poor dear\nman set his hand to it whilst he was a dying.--\"Ah!\" said I, \"I foresee\nyou'll never live to see 'em come together; but their first son shall be\nchristened Jeremiah after you, that I promise you.\"----But come, I say,\nwhat is the matter? Don't you like him?\n\n_Letit._ I fear, Sir--if I must speak--I fear I was less agreeable in\nMr. Doricourt's eyes, than he appeared in mine.\n\n_Hardy._ There you are mistaken; for I asked him, and he told me he\nliked you vastly. Don't you think he must have taken a fancy to her?\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Why really I think so, as I was not by.\n\n_Letit._ My dear Sir, I am convinced he has not; but if there is spirit\nor invention in woman, he shall.\n\n_Hardy._ Right, Girl; go to your toilette--\n\n_Letit._ It is not my toilette that can serve me: but a plan has struck\nme, if you will not oppose it, which flatters me with brilliant success.\n\n_Hardy._ Oppose it! not I indeed! What is it?\n\n_Letit._ Why, Sir--it may seem a little paradoxical; but, as he does not\nlike me enough, I want him to like me still less, and will at our next\ninterview endeavour to heighten his indifference into dislike.\n\n_Hardy._ Who the devil could have foreseen that?\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Heaven and earth! Letitia, are you serious?\n\n_Letit._ As serious as the most important business of my life demands.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Why endeavour to make him dislike you?\n\n_Letit._ Because 'tis much easier to convert a sentiment into its\nopposite, than to transform indifference into tender passion.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ That may be good philosophy, but I am afraid you'll find it\na bad maxim.\n\n_Letit._ I have the strongest confidence in it. I am inspired with\nunusual spirits, and on this hazard willingly stake my chance for\nhappiness. I am impatient to begin my measures. [_Exit_ Letitia.\n\n_Hardy._ Can you foresee the end of this, Cousin?\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ No, Sir; nothing less than your penetration can do that, I\nam sure; and I can't stay now to consider it. I am going to call on the\nOgles, and then to Lady Frances Touchwood's, and then to an Auction,\nand then--I don't know where----but I shall be at home time enough to\nwitness this extraordinary interview. Good-bye. [_Exit Mrs._ Racket.\n\n_Hardy._ Well, 'tis an odd thing--I can't understand it--but I foresee\nLetty will have her way, and so I sha'n't give myself the trouble to\ndispute it. [_Exit_ Hardy.\n\nEND OF THE FIRST ACT.\n\n\n\n\nACT II.\n\n\nSCENE I. _Sir George Touchwood_'s.\n\n_Enter_ Doricourt _and_ Sir George.\n\n\n_Doricourt._\n\nMarried, ha! ha! ha! you, whom I heard in Paris say such things of the\nsex, are in London a married man.\n\n_Sir Geo._ The sex is still what it has ever been since _la petite\nmorale_ banished substantial virtues; and rather than have given my name\nto one of your high-bred fashionable dames, I'd have crossed the line in\na fire-ship, and married a Japanese.\n\n_Doric._ Yet you have married an English beauty, yea, and a beauty born\nin high life.\n\n_Sir Geo._ True; but she has a simplicity of heart and manners, that\nwould have become the fair Hebrew damsels toasted by the Patriarchs.\n\n_Doric._ Ha! ha! Why, thou art a downright matrimonial Quixote. My life\non't, she becomes as mere a Town Lady in six months as though she had\nbeen bred to the trade.\n\n_Sir Geo._ Common--common--(_contemptuously_). No, Sir, Lady Frances\ndespises high life so much from the ideas I have given her, that she'll\nlive in it like a salamander in fire.\n\n_Doric._ Oh, that the circle _dans la place Victoire_ could witness thy\nextravagance! I'll send thee off to St. Evreux this night, drawn at full\nlength, and coloured after nature.\n\n_Sir Geo._ Tell him then, to add to the ridicule, that Touchwood glories\nin the name of Husband; that he has found in one Englishwoman more\nbeauty than Frenchmen ever saw, and more goodness than Frenchwomen can\nconceive.\n\n_Doric._ Well--enough of description. Introduce me to this ph\u00c5\u0093nix; I\ncame on purpose.\n\n_Sir Geo._ Introduce!--oh, aye, to be sure--I believe Lady Frances is\nengaged just now--but another time. How handsome the dog looks to-day!\n_Aside._\n\n_Doric._ Another time!--but I have no other time. 'Sdeath! this is the\nonly hour I can command this fortnight!\n\n_Sir Geo._ [_Aside._ I am glad to hear it, with all my soul.] So then,\nyou can't dine with us to-day? That's very unlucky.\n\n_Doric._ Oh, yes--as to dinner--yes, I can, I believe, contrive to dine\nwith you to-day.\n\n_Sir Geo._ Psha! I didn't think on what I was saying; I meant\nsupper.--You can't sup with us?\n\n_Doric._ Why, supper will be rather more convenient than dinner.--But\nyou are fortunate--if you had ask'd me any other night, I could not have\ncome.\n\n_Sir Geo._ To-night!--Gad, now I recollect, we are particularly engaged\nto-night.--But to-morrow night--\n\n_Doric._ Why look ye, Sir George, 'tis very plain you have no\ninclination to let me see your wife at all; so here I sit (_throws\nhimself on a sopha._)--There's my hat, and here are my legs.--Now I\nsha'n't stir till I have seen her; and I have no engagements: I'll\nbreakfast, dine, and sup with you every day this week.\n\n_Sir Geo._ Was there ever such a provoking wretch! But, to be plain with\nyou, Doricourt, I and my house are at your service: but you are a damn'd\nagreeable fellow, and ten years younger than I am; and the women, I\nobserve, always simper when you appear. For these reasons, I had rather,\nwhen Lady Frances and I are together, that you should forget we are\nacquainted, further than a nod, a smile, or a how-d'ye.\n\n_Doric._ Very well.\n\n_Sir Geo._ It is not merely yourself in _propri\u00c3\u00a2 person\u00c3\u00a2_ that I object\nto; but, if you are intimate here, you'll make my house still more the\nfashion than it is; and it is already so much so, that my doors are of\nno use to me. I married Lady Frances to engross her to myself; yet such\nis the blessed freedom of modern manners, that, in spite of me, her\neyes, thoughts, and conversation, are continually divided amongst all\nthe Flirts and Coxcombs of Fashion.\n\n_Doric._ To be sure, I confess that kind of freedom is carried rather\ntoo far. 'Tis hard one can't have a jewel in one's cabinet, but the\nwhole town must be gratified with its lustre. He sha'n't preach me out\nof seeing his wife, though. _Aside._\n\n_Sir Geo._ Well, now, that's reasonable. When you take time to reflect,\nDoricourt, I always observe you decide right, and therefore I hope----\n\n      _Enter Servant._\n\n_Serv._ Sir, my Lady desires----\n\n_Sir Geo._ I am particularly engaged.\n\n_Doric._ Oh, Lord, that shall be no excuse in the world (_leaping\nfrom the sopha_). Lead the way, John.--I'll attend your Lady. [_Exit,\nfollowing the Servant._\n\n_Sir Geo._ What devil possessed me to talk about her!--Here, Doricourt!\n(_Running after him._) Doricourt!\n\n      _Enter_ Mrs. Racket, _and_ Miss Ogle, _followed by a\n      Servant_.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Acquaint your Lady, that Mrs. Racket, and Miss Ogle, are\nhere. [_Exit_ Servant.\n\n_Miss Ogle._ I shall hardly know Lady Frances, 'tis so long since I was\nin Shropshire.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ And I'll be sworn you never saw her _out_ of\nShropshire.--Her father kept her locked up with his Caterpillars and\nShells; and loved her beyond any thing--but a blue Butterfly, and a\npetrified Frog!\n\n_Miss Ogle._ Ha! ha! ha!--Well, 'twas a cheap way of breeding her:--you\nknow he was very poor, though a Lord; and very high-spirited, though a\nVirtuoso.--In town, her Pantheons, Operas, and Robes de Cour, would have\nswallowed his Sea-Weeds, Moths, and Monsters, in six weeks!--Sir George,\nI find, thinks his Wife a most extraordinary creature: he has taught her\nto despise every thing like Fashionable Life, and boasts that example\nwill have no effect on her.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ There's a great degree of impertinence in all that--I'll\ntry to make her a Fine Lady, to humble him.\n\n_Miss Ogle._ That's just the thing I wish.\n\n      _Enter Lady_ Frances.\n\n_Lady Fran._ I beg ten thousand pardons, my dear Mrs. Racket.--Miss\nOgle, I rejoice to see you: I should have come to you sooner, but I was\ndetained in conversation by Mr. Doricourt.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Pray make no apology; I am quite happy that we have your\nLadyship in town at last.--What stay do you make?\n\n_Lady Fran._ A short one! Sir George talks with regret of the scenes we\nhave left; and as the ceremony of presentation is over, will, I believe,\nsoon return.\n\n_Miss Ogle._ Sure he can't be so cruel! Does your Ladyship wish to\nreturn so soon?\n\n_Lady Fran._ I have not the habit of consulting my own wishes; but,\nI think, if they decide, we shall not return immediately. I have yet\nhardly form'd an idea of London.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ I shall quarrel with your Lord and Master, if he dares\nthink of depriving us of you so soon. How do you dispose of yourself\nto-day?\n\n_Lady Fran._ Sir George is going with me this morning to the mercer's,\nto chuse a silk; and then----\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Chuse a silk for you! ha! ha! ha! Sir George chuses your\nlaces too, I hope; your gloves, and your pincushions!\n\n_Lady Fran._ Madam!\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ I am glad to see you blush, my dear Lady Frances. These are\nstrange homespun ways! If you do these things, pray keep 'em secret.\nLord bless us! If the Town should know your husband chuses your gowns!\n\n_Miss Ogle._ You are very young, my Lady, and have been brought up in\nsolitude. The maxims you learnt among the Wood-Nymphs in Shropshire,\nwon't pass current here, I assure you.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Why, my dear creature, you look quite frighten'd!--Come,\nyou shall go with us to an Exhibition, and an Auction.--Afterwards,\nwe'll take a turn in the Park, and then drive to Kensington;--so we\nshall be at home by four, to dress; and in the evening I'll attend you\nto Lady Brilliant's masquerade.\n\n_Lady Fran._ I shall be very happy to be of your party, if Sir George\nhas no engagements.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ What! Do you stand so low in your own opinion, that you\ndare not trust yourself without Sir George! If you chuse to play Darby\nand Joan, my dear, you should have stay'd in the country;--'tis an\nExhibition not calculated for London, I assure you!\n\n_Miss Ogle._ What I suppose, my Lady, you and Sir George, will be seen\npacing it comfortably round the Canal, arm and arm, and then go lovingly\ninto the same carriage;--dine _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_, spend the evening at\nPicquet, and so go soberly to bed at Eleven!--Such a snug plan may do\nfor an Attorney and his Wife; but, for Lady Frances Touchwood, 'tis as\nunsuitable as linsey-woolsey, or a black bonnet at the _Festino_!\n\n_Lady Fran._ These are rather new doctrines to me!--But, my dear Mrs.\nRacket, you and Miss Ogle must judge of these things better than I\ncan. As you observe, I am but young, and may have caught absurd\nopinions.--Here is Sir George!\n\n      _Enter Sir_ George.\n\n_Sir Geo._ (_Aside._) 'Sdeath! another room full!\n\n_Lady Fran._ My love! Mrs. Racket, and Miss Ogle.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Give you joy, Sir George.--We came to rob you of Lady\nFrances for a few hours.\n\n_Sir Geo._ A few hours!\n\n_Lady Fran._ Oh, yes! I am going to an Exhibition, and an Auction,\nand the Park, and Kensington, and a thousand places!--It is quite\nridiculous, I find, for married people to be always together--We shall\nbe laughed at!\n\n_Sir Geo._ I am astonished!--Mrs. Racket, what does the dear creature\nmean?\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Mean, Sir George!--what she says, I imagine.\n\n_Miss Ogle._ Why, you know, Sir, as Lady Frances had the misfortune to\nbe bred entirely in the Country, she cannot be supposed to be versed in\nFashionable Life.\n\n_Sir Geo._ No; heaven forbid she should!--If she had, Madam, she would\nnever have been my Wife!\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Are you serious?\n\n_Sir Geo._ Perfectly so.--I should never have had the courage to have\nmarried a well-bred Fine Lady.\n\n_Miss Ogle._ Pray, Sir, what do you take a Fine Lady to be, that you\nexpress such fear of her? (_sneeringly._)\n\n_Sir Geo._ A being easily described, Madam, as she is seen every where,\nbut in her own house. She sleeps at home, but she lives all over the\ntown. In her mind, every sentiment gives place to the Lust of Conquest,\nand the vanity of being particular. The feelings of Wife, and Mother,\nare lost in the whirl of dissipation. If she continues virtuous, 'tis\nby chance--and if she preserves her Husband from ruin, 'tis by her\ndexterity at the Card-Table!--Such a Woman I take to be a perfect Fine\nLady!\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ And you I take to be a slanderous Cynic of\ntwo-and-thirty.--Twenty years hence, one might have forgiven such a\nlibel!--Now, Sir, hear my definition of a Fine Lady:--She is a creature\nfor whom Nature has done much, and Education more; she has Taste,\nElegance, Spirit, Understanding. In her manner she is free, in her\nmorals nice. Her behaviour is undistinguishingly polite to her Husband,\nand all mankind;--her sentiments are for their hours of retirement. In a\nword, a Fine Lady is the life of conversation, the spirit of society,\nthe joy of the public!--Pleasure follows where ever she appears, and\nthe kindest wishes attend her slumbers.--Make haste, then, my dear Lady\nFrances, commence Fine Lady, and force your Husband to acknowledge the\njustness of my picture!\n\n_Lady Fran._ I am sure 'tis a delightful one. How can you dislike it,\nSir George? You painted Fashionable Life in colours so disgusting, that\nI thought I hated it; but, on a nearer view, it seems charming. I have\nhitherto lived in obscurity; 'tis time that I should be a Woman of the\nWorld. I long to begin;--my heart pants with expectation and delight!\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Come, then; let us begin directly. I am inpatient to\nintroduce you to that Society, which you were born to ornament and\ncharm.\n\n_Lady Fran._ Adieu! my Love!--We shall meet again at dinner. (_Going._)\n\n_Sir Geo._ Sure, I am in a dream!--Fanny!\n\n_Lady Fran._ (_returning_) Sir George?\n\n_Sir Geo._ Will you go without me?\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Will you go without me!--ha! ha! ha! what a pathetic\naddress! Why, sure you would not always be seen side by side, like two\nbeans upon a stalk. Are you afraid to trust Lady Frances with me, Sir?\n\n_Sir George._ Heaven and earth! with whom can a man trust his wife,\nin the present state of society? Formerly there were distinctions\nof character amongst ye: every class of females had its particular\ndescription; Grandmothers were pious, Aunts, discreet, Old Maids\ncensorious! but now aunts, grandmothers, girls, and maiden gentlewomen,\nare all the same creature;--a wrinkle more or less is the sole\ndifference between ye.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ That Maiden Gentlewomen have lost their censoriousness, is\nsurely not in your catalogue of grievances.\n\n_Sir Geo._ Indeed it is--and ranked amongst the most serious\ngrievances.--Things went well, Madam, when the tongues of three or four\nold Virgins kept all the Wives and Daughters of a parish in awe. They\nwere the Dragons that guarded the Hesperian fruit; and I wonder they\nhave not been oblig'd, by act of parliament, to resume their function.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Ha! ha! ha! and pension'd, I suppose, for making strict\nenquiries into the lives and conversations of their neighbours.\n\n_Sir Geo._ With all my heart, and impowered to oblige every woman to\nconform her conduct to her real situation. You, for instance, are a\nWidow: your air should be sedate, your dress grave, your deportment\nmatronly, and in all things an example to the young women growing up\nabout you!--instead of which, you are dress'd for conquest, think of\nnothing but ensnaring hearts; are a Coquette, a Wit, and a Fine Lady.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Bear witness to what he says! A Coquette! a Wit! and a\nFine Lady! Who would have expected an eulogy from such an ill-natur'd\nmortal!--Valour to a Soldier, Wisdom to a Judge, or glory to a Prince,\nis not more than such a character to a Woman.\n\n_Miss Ogle._ Sir George, I see, languishes for the charming society of a\ncentury and a half ago; when a grave 'Squire, and a still graver Dame,\nsurrounded by a sober family, form'd a stiff groupe in a mouldy old\nhouse in the corner of a Park.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Delightful serenity! Undisturb'd by any noise but the\ncawing of rooks, and the quarterly rumbling of an old family-coach on a\nstate-visit; with the happy intervention of a friendly call from the\nParish Apothecary, or the Curate's Wife.\n\n_Sir Geo._ And what is the society of which you boast?--a meer chaos,\nin which all distinction of rank is lost in a ridiculous affectation of\nease, and every different order of beings huddled together, as they were\nbefore the creation. In the same _select party_, you will often find the\nwife of a Bishop and a Sharper, of an Earl and a Fidler. In short, 'tis\none universal masquerade, all disguised in the same habits and manners.\n\n_Serv._ Mr. Flutter. [_Exit_ Servant.\n\n_Sir Geo._ Here comes an illustration. Now I defy you to tell from his\nappearance, whether Flutter is a Privy Counsellor or a Mercer, a Lawyer,\nor a Grocer's 'Prentice.\n\n      _Enter_ Flutter.\n\n_Flut._ Oh, just which you please, Sir George; so you don't make me a\nLord Mayor. Ah, Mrs. Racket!----Lady Frances, your most obedient; you\nlook--now hang me, if that's not provoking!--had your gown been of\nanother colour, I would have said the prettiest thing you ever heard in\nyour life.\n\n_Miss Ogle._ Pray give it us.\n\n_Flut._ I was yesterday at Mrs. Bloomer's. She was dress'd all in green;\nno other colour to be seen but that of her face and bosom. So says I, My\ndear Mrs. Bloomer! you look like a Carnation, just bursting from its\npod.\n\n_Sir Geo._ And what said her Husband?\n\n_Flut._ Her Husband! Why, her Husband laugh'd, and said a Cucumber would\nhave been a happier simile.\n\n_Sir Geo._ But there _are_ Husbands, Sir, who would rather have\ncorrected than amended your comparison; I, for instance, should consider\na man's complimenting my Wife as an impertinence.\n\n_Flut._ Why, what harm can there be in compliments? Sure they are not\ninfectious; and, if they were, you, Sir George, of all people breathing,\nhave reason to be satisfied about your Lady's attachment; every body\ntalks of it: that little Bird there, that she killed out of jealousy,\nthe most extraordinary instance of affection, that ever was given.\n\n_Lady Fran._ I kill a Bird through jealousy!--Heavens! Mr. Flutter, how\ncan you impute such a cruelty to me?\n\n_Sir Geo._ I could have forgiven you, if you had.\n\n_Flut._ Oh, what a blundering Fool!--No, no--now I remember--'twas your\nBird, Lady Frances--that's it; your Bullfinch, which Sir George, in one\nof the refinements of his passion, sent into the wide world to seek its\nfortune.--He took it for a Knight in disguise.\n\n_Lady Fran._ Is it possible! O, Sir George, could I have imagin'd it was\nyou who depriv'd me of a creature I was so fond of?\n\n_Sir Geo._ Mr. Flutter, you are one of those busy, idle, meddling\npeople, who, from mere vacuity of mind, are, the most dangerous inmates\nin a family. You have neither feelings nor opinions of your own; but,\nlike a glass in a tavern, bear about those of every Blockhead, who gives\nyou his;--and, because you _mean_ no harm, think yourselves excus'd,\nthough broken friendships, discords, and murders, are the consequences\nof your indiscretions.\n\n_Flut._ (_taking out his Tablets_) Vacuity of Mind!--What was the next?\nI'll write down this sermon; 'tis the first I have heard since my\nGrandmother's funeral.\n\n_Miss Ogle._ Come, Lady Frances, you see what a cruel creature your\nloving Husband can be; so let us leave him.\n\n_Sir Geo._ Madam, Lady Frances shall not go.\n\n_Lady Fran. Shall_ not, Sir George?--This is the first time such an\nexpression--(_weeping_)\n\n_Sir Geo._ My love! my life!\n\n_Lady Fran._ Don't imagine I'll be treated like a Child! denied what I\nwish, and then pacified with sweet words.\n\n_Miss Ogle_ (_apart_). The Bullfinch! that's an excellent subject; never\nlet it down.\n\n_Lady Fran._ I see plainly you would deprive me of every pleasure, as\nwell as of my sweet Bird--out of pure love!--Barbarous Man!\n\n_Sir Geo._ 'Tis well, Madam;--your resentment of that circumstance\nproves to me, what I did not before suspect, that you are deficient both\nin tenderness and understanding.--Tremble to think the hour approaches,\nin which you would give worlds for such a proof of my love. Go, Madam,\ngive yourself to the Public; abandon your heart to dissipation, and\nsee if, in the scenes of gaiety and folly that await you, you can\nfind a recompence for the lost affection of a doating Husband.\n[_Exit_ Sir George.\n\n_Flut._ Lord! what a fine thing it is to have the gift of Speech! I\nsuppose Sir George practises at Coachmakers-hall, or the Black-horse in\nBond-street.\n\n_Lady Fran._ He is really angry; I cannot go.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Not go! Foolish Creature! you are arrived at the moment,\nwhich some time or other was sure to happen; and everything depends on\nthe use you make of it.\n\n_Miss Ogle._ Come, Lady Frances! don't hesitate!--the minutes are\nprecious.\n\n_Lady Fran._ I could find in my heart!--and yet I won't give up\nneither.--If I should in this instance, he'll expect it for ever.\n\n      [_Exeunt Lady_ Frances, _and Mrs._ Racket.\n\n_Miss Ogle._ Now you act like a Woman of Spirit.\n\n      [_Exeunt Miss_ Ogle, _and Mrs._ Racket.\n\n_Flut._ A fair tug, by Jupiter--between Duty and Pleasure!--Pleasure\nbeats, and off we go, _I\u00c3\u00b6 triumphe_! [_Exit_ Flutter.\n\n\n      _Scene changes to an Auction Room.--Busts, Pictures, &c. &c._\n\n      _Enter_ Silvertongue _with three Puffers_.\n\n_Silv._ Very well,--very well.--This morning will be devoted to\ncuriosity; my sale begins to-morrow at eleven. But, Mrs. Fagg, if you\ndo no better than you did in Lord Fillagree's sale, I shall discharge\nyou.--You want a knack terribly: and this dress--why, nobody can mistake\nyou for a Gentlewoman.\n\n_Fag._ Very true, Mr. Silvertongue; but I can't dress like a Lady upon\nHalf-a-crown a day, as the saying is.--If you want me to dress like a\nLady, you must double my pay.----Double or quits, Mr. Silvertongue.\n\n_Silv._----_Five Shillings_ a day! what a demand! Why, Woman, there are\na thousand Parsons in the town, who don't make Five Shillings a day;\nthough they preach, pray, christen, marry, and bury, for the Good of the\nCommunity.--Five Shillings a day!--why, 'tis the pay of a Lieutenant in\na marching Regiment, who keeps a Servant, a Mistress, a Horse; fights,\ndresses, ogles, makes love, and dies upon Five Shillings a day.\n\n_Fag._ Oh, as to that, all that's very right. A Soldier should not be\ntoo fond of life; and forcing him to do all these things upon Five\nShillings a day, is the readiest way to make him tir'd on't.\n\n_Silv._ Well, Mask, have you been looking into the Antiquaries?--have\nyou got all the terms of art in a string--aye?\n\n_Mask._ Yes, I have: I know the Age of a Coin by the taste; and can fix\nthe Birth-day of a Medal, _Anno Mundi_ or _Anno Domini_, though the\ngreen rust should have eaten up every character. But you know, the brown\nsuit and the wig I wear when I personate the Antiquary, are in Limbo.\n\n_Silv._ Those you have on, may do.\n\n_Mask._ These!--Why, in these I am a young travell'd _Cognoscento_:\nMr. Glib bought them of Sir Tom Totter's Valet; and I am going there\ndirectly. You know his Picture-Sale comes on to-day; and I have got my\nhead full of Parmegiano, Sal Rosa, Metzu, Tarbaek, and Vandermeer. I\ntalk of the relief of Woovermans, the spirit of Teniers, the colouring\nof the Venetian School, and the correctness of the Roman. I distinguish\nClaude by his Sleep, and Ruysdael by his Water. The rapidity of\nTintoret's pencil strikes me at the first glance; whilst the harmony of\nVandyk, and the glow of Correggio, point out their Masters.\n\n      _Enter Company._\n\n_1st Lady._ Hey-day, Mr. Silvertongue! what, nobody here!\n\n_Silv._ Oh, my Lady, we shall have company enough in a trice; if your\ncarriage is seen at my door, no other will pass it, I am sure.\n\n_1st Lady._ Familiar Monster! [_Aside._] That's a beautiful Diana, Mr.\nSilvertongue; but in the name of Wonder, how came Act\u00c3\u00a6on to be placed on\nthe top of a House?\n\n_Silv._ That's a David and Bathsheba, Ma'am.\n\n_Lady._ Oh, I crave their pardon!----I remember the Names, but know\nnothing of the Story.\n\n      _More Company enters._\n\n_1st Gent._ Was not that Lady Frances Touchwood, coming up with Mrs.\nRacket?\n\n_2d Gent._ I think so;----yes, it is, faith.----Let us go nearer.\n\n      _Enter Lady_ Frances, _Mrs._ Racket, _and Miss_ Ogle.\n\n_Silv._ Yes, Sir, this is to be the first Lot:--the Model of a City, in\nwax.\n\n_2d Gent._ The Model of a City! What City?\n\n_Silv._ That I have not been able to discover; but call it Rome, Pekin,\nor London, 'tis still a City: you'll find in it the same jarring\ninterests, the same passions, the same virtues, and the same vices,\nwhatever the name.\n\n_Gent._ You may as well present us a Map of _Terra Incognita_.\n\n_Silv._ Oh, pardon me, Sir! a lively imagination would convert this\nwaxen City into an endless and interesting amusement. For instance--look\ninto this little House on the right-hand; there are four old Prudes in\nit, taking care of their Neighbours Reputations. This elegant Mansion\non the left, decorated with Corinthian pillars--who needs be told that\nit belongs to a Court Lord, and is the habitation of Patriotism,\nPhilosophy, and Virtue? Here's a City Hall--the rich steams that\nissue from the windows, nourish a neighbouring Work-House. Here's a\nChurch--we'll pass over that, the doors are shut. The Parsonage-house\ncomes next;--we'll take a peep here, however.--Look at the Doctor! he's\nasleep on a volume of Toland; whilst his Lady is putting on _rouge_ for\nthe Masquerade.--Oh! oh! this can be no English City; our Parsons are\nall orthodox, and their Wives the daughters of Modesty and Meekness.\n\n      _Lady_ Frances _and Miss_ Ogle _come forward, followed by_\n      Courtall.\n\n_Lady Fran._ I wish Sir George was here.----This man follows me about,\nand stares at me in such a way, that I am quite uneasy.\n\n_Miss Ogle._ He has travell'd, and is heir to an immense estate; so he's\nimpertinent by Patent.\n\n_Court._ You are very cruel, Ladies. Miss Ogle--you will not let me\nspeak to you. As to this little scornful Beauty, she has frown'd me dead\nfifty times.\n\n_Lady Fran._ Sir--I am a married Woman. (_Confus'd._)\n\n_Court._ A married Woman! a good hint. (_Aside._) 'Twould be a shame if\nsuch a charming Woman was not married. But I see you are a Daphne just\ncome from your sheep, and your meadows; your crook, and your waterfalls.\nPray now, who is the happy Damon, to whom you have vow'd eternal truth\nand constancy?\n\n_Miss Ogle._ 'Tis Lady Frances Touchwood, Mr. Courtall, to whom you are\nspeaking.\n\n_Court._ Lady Frances! By Heaven, that's Saville's old flame. [_Aside._]\nI beg your Ladyship's pardon. I ought to have believed that such beauty\ncould belong only to your Name----a Name I have long been enamour'd of;\nbecause I knew it to be that of the finest Woman in the world.\n\n      _Mrs._ Racket _comes forward_.\n\n_Lady Fran._ [_Apart._] My dear Mrs. Racket, I am so frighten'd! Here's\na Man making love to me, though he knows I am married.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Oh, the sooner for that, my dear; don't mind him. Was you\nat the _Cassino_ last night, Mr. Courtall?\n\n_Court._ I look'd in.----'Twas impossible to stay. No body there but\nAntiques. You'll be at Lady Brilliant's to-night, doubtless?\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Yes, I go with Lady Frances.\n\n_Lady Fran._ Bless me! I did not know this Gentleman was acquainted with\nMrs. Racket.--I behaved so rude to him! [_To Miss_ Ogle.]\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Come, Ma'am; [_looking at her Watch_.] 'tis past one. I\nprotest, if we don't fly to Kensington, we sha'n't find a soul there.\n\n_Lady Fran._ Won't this Gentleman go with us?\n\n_Court._ [_Looking surpris'd._] To be sure, you make me happy, Madam,\nbeyond description.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Oh, never mind him--he'll follow.\n\n      [_Exeunt Lady_ Frances, _Mrs._ Racket, _and Miss_ Ogle.\n\n_Court._ Lady _Touchwood_! with a vengeance! But, 'tis always so;--your\nreserved Ladies are like ice, 'egad!--no sooner begin to soften, than\nthey melt. [_Following._\n\nEND OF THE SECOND ACT.\n\n\n\n\nACT III.\n\n\nSCENE I. _Mr._ Hardy'_s_.\n\n_Enter_ Letitia _and Mrs._ Racket.\n\n\n_Mrs._ Racket.\n\nCome, prepare, prepare; your Lover is coming.\n\n_Letit._ My Lover!--Confess now that my absence at dinner was a severe\nmortification to him.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ I can't absolutely swear it spoilt his appetite; he eat as\nif he was hungry, and drank his wine as though he liked it.\n\n_Letit._ What was the apology?\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ That you were ill;--but I gave him a hint, that your\nextreme bashfulness could not support his eye.\n\n_Letit._ If I comprehend him, aukwardness and bashfulness are the last\nfaults he can pardon in a woman; so expect to see me transform'd into\nthe veriest maukin.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ You persevere then?\n\n_Letit._ Certainly. I know the design is a rash one, and the event\nimportant;--it either makes Doricourt mine by all the tenderest ties of\npassion, or deprives me of him for ever; and never to be his wife will\nafflict me less, than to be his wife and not be belov'd.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ So you wo'n't trust to the good old maxim--\"Marry first,\nand love will follow?\"\n\n_Letit._ As readily as I would venture my last guinea, that good fortune\nmight follow. The woman that has not touch'd the heart of a man before\nhe leads her to the altar, has scarcely a chance to charm it when\npossession and security turn their powerful arms against her.--But\nhere he comes.--I'll disappear for a moment.--Don't spare me.\n[_Exit_ Letitia.\n\n      _Enter_ Doricourt (_not seeing Mrs._ Racket.)\n\n_Doric._ So! [_Looking at a Picture._] this is my mistress, I\npresume.--_Ma foi!_ the painter has hit her off.--The downcast eye--the\nblushing cheek--timid--apprehensive--bashful.--A tear and a prayer-book\nwould have made her _La Bella Magdalena_.--\n\n  Give _me_ a woman in whose touching mien\n  A mind, a soul, a polish'd art is seen;\n  Whose motion speaks, whose poignant air can move.\n  Such are the darts to wound with endless love.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Is that an impromptu? [_Touching him on the shoulder with\nher fan._]\n\n_Doric._ (_starting._) Madam!--[_Aside._] Finely caught!--Not\nabsolutely--it struck me during the dessert, as a motto for your\npicture.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Gallantly turn'd! I perceive, however, Miss Hardy's charms\nhave made no violent impression on you.--And who can wonder?--the poor\ngirl's defects are so obvious.\n\n_Doric._ Defects!\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Merely those of education.--Her father's indulgence ruin'd\nher.--_Mauvaise honte_--conceit and ignorance--all unite in the Lady you\nare to marry.\n\n_Doric._ Marry!--I marry such a woman!--Your picture, I hope, is\novercharged.--I marry _mauvaise honte_, pertness and ignorance!\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Thank your stars, that ugliness and ill temper are not\nadded to the list.--You must think her handsome?\n\n_Doric._ Half her personal beauty would content me; but could the\nMedicean Venus be animated for me, and endowed with a vulgar soul,\n_I_ should become the statue, and my heart transformed to marble.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Bless us!--We are in a hopeful way then!\n\n_Doric._ (_Aside._) There must be some envy in this!--I see she is a\ncoquette. Ha, ha, ha! And you imagine I am persuaded of the truth of\nyour character? ha, ha, ha! Miss Hardy, I have been assur'd, Madam, is\nelegant and accomplished:----but one must allow for a Lady's painting.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ (_Aside._) I'll be even with him for that. Ha! ha! ha! and\nso you have found me out!--Well, I protest I meant no harm; 'twas only\nto increase the _\u00c3\u00a9clat_ of her appearance, that I threw a veil over her\ncharms.----Here comes the Lady;--her elegance and accomplishments will\nannounce themselves.\n\n      _Enter_ Letitia, _running_.\n\n_Let._ La! Cousin, do you know that our John----oh, dear heart!--I\ndidn't see you, Sir. (_Hanging down her head, and dropping behind Mrs._\nRacket.)\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Fye, Letitia! Mr. Doricourt thinks you a woman of elegant\nmanners. Stand forward, and confirm his opinion.\n\n_Let._ No, no; keep before me.----He's my Sweetheart; and 'tis impudent\nto look one's Sweetheart in the face, you know.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ You'll allow in future for a Lady's painting, Sir. Ha! ha!\nha!\n\n_Doric._ I am astonish'd!\n\n_Let._ Well, hang it, I'll take heart.--Why, he is but a Man, you know,\nCousin;--and I'll let him see I wasn't born in a Wood to be scar'd by an\nOwl. [_Half apart; advances, and looks at him through her fingers._] He!\nhe! he! [_Goes up to him, and makes a very stiff formal curtesy._]--[_He\nbows._]--You have been a great Traveller, Sir, I hear?\n\n_Dor._ Yes, Madam.\n\n_Let._ Then I wish you'd tell us about the fine sights you saw when you\nwent over-sea.--I have read in a book, that there are some countries\nwhere the Men and Women are all Horses.--Did you see any of them?\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Mr. Doricourt is not prepared, my dear, for these\nenquiries; he is reflecting on the importance of the question, and will\nanswer you----when he can.\n\n_Let._ When he can! Why, he's as slow in speech, as Aunt Margery, when\nshe's reading Thomas Aquinas;--and stands gaping like mum-chance.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Have a little discretion.\n\n_Let._ Hold your tongue!--Sure I may say what I please before I am\nmarried, if I can't afterwards.--D'ye think a body does not know how to\ntalk to a Sweetheart. He is not the first I have had.\n\n_Dor._ Indeed!\n\n_Let._ Oh, Lud! He speaks!--Why, if you must know--there was the Curate\nat home:--when Papa was a-hunting, he used to come a suitoring, and make\nspeeches to me out of books.--No body knows what a _mort_ of fine things\nhe used to say to me;--and call me Venis, and Jubah, and Dinah!\n\n_Dor._ And pray, fair Lady, how did you answer him?\n\n_Let._ Why, I used to say, Look you, Mr. Curate, don't think to come\nover me with your flim-flams; for a better Man than ever trod in your\nshoes, is coming over-sea to marry me;--but, ifags! I begin to think I\nwas out.--Parson Dobbins was the sprightfuller man of the two.\n\n_Dor._ Surely this cannot be Miss Hardy!\n\n_Let._ Laws! why, don't you know me! You saw me to-day--but I was\ndaunted before my Father, and the Lawyer, and all them, and did not care\nto speak out:--so, may be, you thought I couldn't;--but I can talk as\nfast as any body, when I know folks a little:--and now I have shewn my\nparts, I hope you'll like me better.\n\n      _Enter_ Hardy.\n\n_Har._ I foresee this won't do!--Mr. Doricourt, may be you take my\nDaughter for a Fool; but you are mistaken: she's a sensible Girl, as any\nin England.\n\n_Dor._ I am convinced she has a very uncommon understanding, Sir.\n[_Aside._] I did not think he had been such an Ass.\n\n_Let._ My Father will undo the whole.--Laws! Papa, how can you think he\ncan take me for a fool! when every body knows I beat the Potecary at\nConundrums last Christmas-time? and didn't I make a string of names,\nall in riddles, for the Lady's Diary?--There was a little River, and a\ngreat House; that was Newcastle.--There was what a Lamb says, and three\nLetters; that was _Ba_, and _k-e-r_, ker, Baker.--There was--\n\n_Hardy._ Don't stand ba-a-ing there. You'll make me mad in a moment!--I\ntell you, Sir, that for all that, she's dev'lish sensible.\n\n_Doric._ Sir, I give all possible credit to your assertions.\n\n_Letit._ Laws! Papa, do come along. If you stand watching, how can my\nSweetheart break his mind, and tell me how he admires me?\n\n_Doric._ That would be difficult, indeed, Madam.\n\n_Hardy._ I tell you, Letty, I'll have no more of this.----I see well\nenough----\n\n_Letit._ Laws! don't snub me before my Husband--that is to be.--You'll\nteach him to snub me too,--and I believe, by his looks, he'd like to\nbegin now.--So, let us go, Cousin; you may tell the Gentleman what\na genus I have--how I can cut Watch-papers, and work Cat-gut; make\nQuadrille-baskets with Pins, and take Profiles in Shade; ay, as\nwell as the Lady at No. 62, South Moulton-street, Grosvenor-square.\n[_Exit_ Hardy _and_ Letitia.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ What think you of my painting, now?\n\n_Doric._ Oh, mere water-colours, Madam! The Lady has caricatured your\npicture.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ And how does she strike you on the whole?\n\n_Doric._ Like a good Design, spoiled by the incapacity of the Artist.\nHer faults are evidently the result of her Father's weak indulgence. I\nobserved an expression in her eye, that seemed to satyrise the folly of\nher lips.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ But at her age, when Education is fixed, and Manner becomes\nNature--hopes of improvement--\n\n_Doric._ Would be as rational, as hopes of Gold from a Jugler's\nCrucible.--Doricourt's Wife must be incapable of improvement; but it\nmust be because she's got beyond it.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ I am pleased your misfortune sits no heavier.\n\n_Doric._ Your pardon, Madam; so mercurial was the hour in which I was\nborn, that misfortunes always go plump to the bottom of my heart, like a\npebble in water, and leave the surface unruffled.--I shall certainly set\noff for Bath, or the other world, to-night;--but whether I shall use\na chaise with four swift coursers, or go off in a tangent--from the\naperture of a pistol, deserves consideration; so I make my _adieus_.\n(_Going._)\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Oh, but I intreat you, postpone your journey 'till\nto-morrow; determine on which you will--you must be this night at the\nMasquerade.\n\n_Doric._ Masquerade!\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Why not?--If you resolve to visit the other world, you may\nas well take one night's pleasure first in this, you know.\n\n_Doric._ Faith, that's very true; Ladies are the best Philosophers,\nafter all. Expect me at the Masquerade. [_Exit_ Doricourt.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ He's a charming Fellow!--I think Letitia sha'n't have him.\n(_Going._)\n\n      _Enter_ Hardy.\n\n_Hardy._ What's he gone?\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Yes; and I am glad he is. You would have ruined us!--Now, I\nbeg, Mr. Hardy, you won't interfere in this business; it is a little out\nof your way. [_Exit Mrs._ Racket.\n\n_Hardy._ Hang me, if I don't though. I foresee very clearly what will\nbe the end of it, if I leave ye to yourselves; so, I'll e'en follow him\nto the Masquerade, and tell him all about it: Let me see.--What shall my\ndress be? A Great Mogul? No.--A Grenadier? No;--no, that, I foresee,\nwould make a laugh. Hang me, if I don't send to my favourite little\nQuick, and borrow his Jew Isaac's dress:--I know the Dog likes a glass\nof good wine; so I'll give him a bottle of my Forty-eight, and he shall\nteach me. Aye, that's it--I'll be Cunning Little Isaac! If they complain\nof my want of wit, I'll tell 'em the cursed Duenna wears the breeches,\nand has spoilt my parts. [_Exit_ Hardy.\n\n\nSCENE II.----_Courtall_'s.\n\n_Enter_ Courtall, Saville, _and three others, from an Apartment in the\nback Scene_. (_The last three tipsey._)\n\n_Court._ You shan't go yet:--Another catch, and another bottle!\n\n_First Gent._ May I be a bottle, and an empty bottle, if you catch me at\nthat!--Why, I am going to the Masquerade. Jack----, you know who I mean,\nis to meet me, and we are to have a leap at the new lustres.\n\n_Second Gent._ And I am going too--a Harlequin--(_hiccups_) Am not I in\na pretty pickle to make Harlequinades?----And Tony, here--he is going in\nthe disguise--in the disguise--of a Gentleman!\n\n_First Gent._ We are all very disguised; so bid them draw up--D'ye hear!\n[_Exeunt the three Gentlemen._\n\n_Sav._ Thy skull, Courtall, is a Lady's thimble:--no, an egg-shell.\n\n_Court._ Nay, then you are gone too; you never aspire to similes, but in\nyour cups.\n\n_Sav._ No, no; I am steady enough--but the fumes of the wine pass\ndirectly through thy egg-shell, and leave thy brain as cool as----Hey! I\nam quite sober; my similes fail me.\n\n_Court._ Then we'll sit down here, and have one sober bottle.--Bring a\ntable and glasses.\n\n_Sav._ I'll not swallow another drop; no, though the juice should be the\ntrue Falernian.\n\n_Court._ By the bright eyes of her you love, you shall drink her health.\n\n_Sav._ Ah! (_sitting down_.) Her I loved is gone (_sighing._)--She's\nmarried!\n\n_Court._ Then bless your stars you are not her Husband! I would be\nHusband to no Woman in Europe, who was not dev'lish rich, and dev'lish\nugly.\n\n_Sav._ Wherefore ugly?\n\n_Court._ Because she could not have the conscience to exact those\nattentions that a Pretty Wife expects; or, if she should, her\nresentments would be perfectly easy to me, nobody would undertake to\nrevenge her cause.\n\n_Sav._ Thou art a most licentious fellow!\n\n_Court._ I should hate my own wife, that's certain; but I have a warm\nheart for those of other people; and so here's to the prettiest Wife in\nEngland--Lady Frances Touchwood.\n\n_Sav._ Lady Frances Touchwood! I rise to drink her. (_drinks_) How the\ndevil came Lady Frances in your head? I never knew you give a Woman of\nChastity before.\n\n_Court._ That's odd, for you have heard me give half the Women of\nFashion in England.--But, pray now, what do you take a Woman of Chastity\nto be? (_sneeringly._)\n\n_Sav._ Such a woman as Lady Frances Touchwood, Sir.\n\n_Court._ Oh, you are grave, Sir; I remember you was an Adorer of\nher's--Why didn't you marry her?\n\n_Sav._ I had not the arrogance to look so high--Had my fortune been\nworthy of her, she should not have been ignorant of my admiration.\n\n_Court._ Precious fellow! What, I suppose you would not dare tell her\nnow that you admire her?\n\n_Sav._ No, nor you.\n\n_Court._ By the Lord, I have told her so.\n\n_Sav._ Have! Impossible!\n\n_Court._ Ha! ha! ha!--Is it so?\n\n_Sav._ How did she receive the declaration?\n\n_Court._ Why, in the old way; blushed, and frowned, and said she was\nmarried.\n\n_Sav._ What amazing things thou art capable of! I could more easily\nhave taken the Pope by the beard, than prophaned her ears with such a\ndeclaration.\n\n_Court._ I shall meet her at Lady Brilliant's to-night, where I shall\nrepeat it; and I'll lay my life, under a mask, she'll hear it all\nwithout blush, or frown.\n\n_Sav._ (_rising_) 'Tis false, Sir!--She won't.\n\n_Court._ She will! (_rising_) Nay, I'd venture to lay a round sum, that\nI prevail on her to go out with me----only to taste the fresh air, I\nmean.\n\n_Sav._ Preposterous vanity! From this moment I suspect that half the\nvictories you have boasted, are false and slanderous, as your pretended\ninfluence with Lady Frances.\n\n_Court._ Pretended!--How should such a Fellow as you, now, who never\nsoared beyond a cherry-cheeked Daughter of a Ploughman in Norfolk, judge\nof the influence of a Man of my Figure and Habits? I could shew thee\na list, in which there are names to shake thy faith in the whole\nsex!--and, to that list I have no doubt of adding the name of Lady----\n\n_Sav._ Hold, Sir! My ears cannot bear the profanation;--you cannot--dare\nnot approach her!--For your soul you dare not mention Love to her! Her\nlook would freeze the word, whilst it hovered on thy licentious lips!\n\n_Court._ Whu! whu! Well, we shall see--this evening, by Jupiter, the\ntrial shall be made--if I fail--I fail.\n\n_Sav._ I think thou darest not!--But my life, my honour on her purity.\n[_Exit_ Saville.\n\n_Court._ Hot-headed fool! But since he has brought it to this point, by\nGad I'll try what can be done with her Ladyship (_musing_)--(_rings_)\nShe's frost-work, and the prejudices of education yet strong: _ergo_,\npassionate professions will only inflame her pride, and put her on her\nguard.--For other arts then!\n\n      _Enter_ Dick.\n\nDick, do you know any of the servants at Sir George Touchwood's?\n\n_Dick._ Yes, Sir; I knows the Groom, and one of the House-maids: for the\nmatter-o'-that, she's my own Cousin; and it was my Mother that holp'd\nher to the place.\n\n_Court._ Do you know Lady Frances's Maid?\n\n_Dick._ I can't say as how I know she.\n\n_Court._ Do you know Sir George's Valet?\n\n_Dick._ No, Sir; but Sally is very thick with Mr. Gibson, Sir George's\nGentleman.\n\n_Court._ Then go there directly, and employ Sally to discover whether\nher Master goes to Lady Brilliant's this evening; and, if he does, the\nname of the shop that sold his Habit.\n\n_Dick._ Yes, Sir.\n\n_Court._ Be exact in your intelligence, and come to me at Boodle's:\n[_Exit_ Dick.] If I cannot otherwise succeed, I'll beguile her as Jove\ndid Alcmena, in the shape of her Husband. The possession of so fine a\nWoman--the triumph over Saville, are each a sufficient motive; and\nunited, they shall be resistless. [_Exit_ Courtall.\n\n\nSCENE III.----_The Street._\n\n_Enter_ Saville.\n\n_Sav._ The air has recover'd me! What have I been doing! Perhaps my\npetulance may be the cause of _her_ ruin, whose honour I asserted:--his\nvanity is piqued;--and where Women are concerned, Courtall can be a\nvillain.\n\n      _Enter_ Dick. _Bows, and passes hastily._\n\nHa! that's his Servant!----Dick!\n\n_Dick._ [_returning_] Sir.\n\n_Sav._ Where are you going, Dick?\n\n_Dick._ Going! I am going, Sir, where my Master sent me.\n\n_Sav._ Well answer'd;--but I have a particular reason for my enquiry,\nand you must tell me.\n\n_Dick._ Why then, Sir, I am going to call upon a Cousin of mine, that\nlives at Sir George Touchwood's.\n\n_Sav._ Very well.--There, [_gives him money_] you must make your Cousin\ndrink my health.--What are you going about?\n\n_Dick._ Why, Sir, I believe 'tis no harm, or elseways I am sure I would\nnot blab.--I am only going to ax if Sir George goes to the Masquerade\nto-night, and what Dress he wears.\n\n_Sav._ Enough! Now, Dick, if you will call at my lodgings in your way\nback, and acquaint me with your Cousin's intelligence, I'll double the\ntrifle I have given you.\n\n_Dick._ Bless your honour, I'll call----never fear. [Exit _Dick._\n\n_Sav._ Surely the occasion may justify the means:--'tis doubly my duty\nto be Lady Frances's Protector. Courtall, I see, is planning an artful\nscheme; but Saville shall out-plot him. [_Exit_ Saville.\n\n\nSCENE IV.----_Sir_ George Touchwood_'s._\n\n_Enter_ Sir George _and_ Villers.\n\n_Vill._ For shame, Sir George! you have left Lady Frances in tears.--How\ncan you afflict her?\n\n_Sir Geo._ 'Tis I that am afflicted;--my dream of happiness is\nover.--Lady Frances and I are disunited.\n\n_Vill._ The Devil! Why, you have been in town but ten days: she can have\nmade no acquaintance for a Commons affair yet.\n\n_Sir Geo._ Pho! 'tis our minds that are disunited: she no longer places\nher whole delight in me; she has yielded herself up to the world!\n\n_Vill._ Yielded herself up to the World! Why did you not bring her to\ntown in a Cage? Then she might have taken a peep at the World!--But,\nafter all, what has the World done? A twelvemonth since you was the\ngayest fellow in it:--If any body ask'd who dresses best?--Sir George\nTouchwood.--Who is the most gallant Man? Sir George Touchwood.--Who is\nthe most wedded to Amusement and Dissipation? Sir George Touchwood.--And\nnow Sir George is metamorphosed into a sour Censor; and talks of\nFashionable Life with as much bitterness, as the old crabbed Fellow in\nRome.\n\n_Sir Geo._ The moment I became possessed of such a jewel as Lady\nFrances, every thing wore a different complexion: that Society in which\nI liv'd with so much _\u00c3\u00a9clat_, became the object of my terror; and I\nthink of the manners of Polite Life, as I do of the atmosphere of a\nPest-house.--My Wife is already infected; she was set upon this morning\nby Maids, Widows, and Bachelors, who carried her off in triumph, in\nspite of my displeasure.\n\n_Vill._ Aye, to be sure; there would have been no triumph in the case,\nif you had not oppos'd it:--but I have heard the whole story from Mrs.\nRacket; and I assure you, Lady Frances didn't enjoy the morning at\nall;--she wish'd for you fifty times.\n\n_Sir Geo._ Indeed! Are you sure of that?\n\n_Vill._ Perfectly sure.\n\n_Sir Geo._ I wish I had known it:----my uneasiness at dinner was\noccasioned by very different ideas.\n\n_Vill._ Here then she comes, to receive your apology; but if she is true\nWoman, her displeasure will rise in proportion to your contrition;--and\ntill you grow careless about her pardon, she won't grant it:----however,\nI'll leave you.----Matrimonial Duets are seldom set in the style I like.\n[_Exit_ Villers.\n\n      _Enter Lady_ Frances.\n\n_Sir Geo._ The sweet sorrow that glitters in these eyes, I cannot bear\n(_embracing her_). Look chearfully, you Rogue.\n\n_Lady Fran._ I cannot look otherwise, if you are pleas'd with me.\n\n_Sir Geo._ Well, Fanny, to-day you made your _entr\u00c3\u00a9e_ in the Fashionable\nWorld; tell me honestly the impressions you receiv'd.\n\n_Lady Fran._ Indeed, Sir George, I was so hurried from place to place,\nthat I had not time to find out what my impressions were.\n\n_Sir Geo._ That's the very spirit of the life you have chosen.\n\n_Lady Fran._ Every body about me seem'd happy--but every body seem'd in\na hurry to be happy somewhere else.\n\n_Sir Geo._ And you like this?\n\n_Lady Fran._ One must like what the rest of the World likes.\n\n_Sir Geo._ Pernicious maxim!\n\n_Lady Fran._ But, my dear Sir George, you have not promis'd to go with\nme to the Masquerade.\n\n_Sir Geo._ 'Twould be a shocking indecorum to be seen together, you\nknow.\n\n_Lady Fran._ Oh, no; I ask'd Mrs. Racket, and she told me we might be\nseen together at the Masquerade--without being laugh'd at.\n\n_Sir Geo._ Really?\n\n_Lady Fran._ Indeed, to tell you the truth, I could wish it was the\nfashion for married people to be inseparable; for I have more heart-felt\nsatisfaction in fifteen minutes with you at my side, than fifteen days\nof amusement could give me without you.\n\n_Sir Geo._ My sweet Creature! How that confession charms me!--Let us\nbegin the Fashion.\n\n_Lady Fran._ O, impossible! We should not gain a single proselyte; and\nyou can't conceive what spiteful things would be said of us.--At\nKensington to-day a Lady met us, whom we saw at Court, when we were\npresented; she lifted up her hands in amazement!----Bless me! said she\nto her companion, here's Lady Francis without Sir Hurlo Thrumbo!--My\ndear Mrs. Racket, consider what an important charge you have! for\nHeaven's sake take her home again, or some Enchanter on a flying Dragon\nwill descend and carry her off.--Oh, said another, I dare say Lady\nFrances has a clue at her heel, like the peerless Rosamond:--her tender\nswain would never have trusted her so far without such a precaution.\n\n_Sir Geo._ Heav'n and Earth!----How shall Innocence preserve its lustre\namidst manners so corrupt!--My dear Fanny, I feel a sentiment for thee\nat this moment, tenderer than Love--more animated than Passion.----I\ncould weep over that purity, expos'd to the sullying breath of Fashion,\nand the _Ton_, in whose latitudinary vortex Chastity herself can\nscarcely move unspotted.\n\n      _Enter_ Gibson.\n\n_Gib._ Your Honour talk'd, I thought, something about going to the\nMasquerade?\n\n_Sir Geo._ Well.\n\n_Gib._ Isn't it?--hasn't your Honour?--I thought your Honour had forgot\nto order a Dress.\n\n_Lady Fran._ Well consider'd, Gibson.--Come, will you be Jew, Turk, or\nHeretic; a Chinese Emperor, or a Ballad-Singer; a Rake, or a Watchman?\n\n_Sir Geo._ Oh, neither, my Love; I can't take the trouble to support a\ncharacter.\n\n_Lady Fran._ You'll wear a Domino then:--I saw a pink Domino trimm'd\nwith blue at the shop where I bought my Habit.--Would you like it?\n\n_Sir Geo._ Any thing, any thing.\n\n_Lady Fran._ Then go about it directly, Gibson.----A pink Domino trimm'd\nwith blue, and a Hat of the same--Come, you have not seen my Dress\nyet--it is most beautiful; I long to have it on.\n\n      [_Exeunt_ Sir George _and_ Lady Frances.\n\n_Gib._ A pink Domino trimm'd with blue, and a Hat of the same----What\nthe devil can it signify to Sally now what his Dress is to be?--Surely\nthe Slut has not made an assignation to meet her Master! [_Exit_ Gibson.\n\nEND OF THE THIRD ACT.\n\n\n\n\nACT IV.\n\n\nSCENE----_A Masquerade._\n\n_A Party dancing Cotillons in front--a variety of Characters pass and\nrepass._\n\n_Enter_ Folly _on a Hobby-Horse, with Cap and Bells_.\n\n\n_Mask._\n\nHey! Tom Fool! what business have you here?\n\n_Foll._ What, Sir! Affront a Prince in his own Dominions! [_Struts off._\n\n_Mountebank._ Who'll buy my Nostrums? Who'll buy my Nostrums?\n\n_Mask._ What are they? (_They all come round him._)\n\n_Mount._ Different sorts, and for different customers. Here's a Liquor\nfor Ladies--it expels the rage of Gaming and Gallantry; Here's a Pill\nfor Members of Parliament--good to settle Consciences. Here's an\nEye-Water for Jealous Husbands--it thickens the Visual Membrane,\nthrough which they see too clearly. Here's a Decoction for the\nClergy--it never sits easy, if the patient has more than One Living.\nHere's a Draught for Lawyers--a great promoter of Modesty. Here's a\nPowder for Projectors--'twill rectify the fumes of an Empty Stomach, and\ndissipate their airy castles.\n\n_Mask._ Have you a Nostrum that can give patience to Young Heirs, whose\nUncles and Fathers are stout and healthy?\n\n_Mount._ Yes; and I have an Infusion for Creditors--it gives resignation\nand humility, when Fine Gentlemen break their promises, or plead their\nprivilege.\n\n_Mask._ Come along:--I'll find you customers for your whole cargo.\n\n      _Enter_ Hardy, _in the Dress of_ Isaac Mendoza.\n\n_Hardy._ Why, isn't it a shame to see so many stout, well-built Young\nFellows, masquerading, and cutting _Couranta's_ here at home--instead of\nmaking the French cut capers to the tune of your Cannon--or sweating the\nSpaniards with an English _Fandango_?--I foresee the end of all this.\n\n_Mask._ Why, thou little testy Israelite! back to Duke's Place; and\npreach your tribe into a subscription for the good of the land on whose\nmilk and honey ye fatten.--Where are your Joshuas and your Gideons, aye?\nWhat! all dwindled into Stockbrokers, Pedlars, and Rag-Men?\n\n_Har._ No, not all. Some of us turn Christians, and by degrees grow into\nall the privileges of Englishmen! In the second generation we are\nPatriots, Rebels, Courtiers, and Husbands. [_Puts his fingers to his\nforehead._]\n\n      _Two other Masks advance._\n\n_3d Mask._ What, my little Isaac!----How the Devil came you here?\nWhere's your old Margaret?\n\n_Har._ Oh, I have got rid of her.\n\n_3d Mask._ How?\n\n_Har._ Why, I persuaded a young Irishman that she was a blooming plump\nBeauty of eighteen; so they made an Elopement, ha! ha! ha! and she is\nnow the Toast of Tipperary. Ha! there's Cousin Racket and her Party;\nthey sha'n't know me. [_Puts on his Mask._\n\n      _Enter Mrs._ Racket, _Lady_ Frances, _Sir_ George, _and_\n      Flutter.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Look at this dumpling Jew; he must be a Lev\u00c3\u00afte by his\nfigure. You have surely practised the flesh-hook a long time, friend, to\nhave raised that goodly presence.\n\n_Har._ About as long, my brisk Widow, as you have been angling for a\nsecond Husband; but my hook has been better baited than your's.--You\nhave only caught Gudgeons, I see. [_Pointing to_ Flutter.\n\n_Flut._ Oh! this is one of the Geniuses they hire to entertain the\nCompany with their _accidental_ sallies.----Let me look at your\nCommon-Place Book, friend.--I want a few good things.\n\n_Har._ I'd oblige you, with all my heart; but you'll spoil them in\nrepeating--or, if you shou'd not, they'll gain you no reputation--for\nno body will believe they are your own.\n\n_Sir Geo._ He knows ye, Flutter;--the little Gentleman fancies himself a\nWit, I see.\n\n_Har._ There's no depending on what _you_ see--the eyes of the jealous\nare not to be trusted.--Look to your Lady.\n\n_Flut._ He knows ye, Sir George.\n\n_Sir Geo._ What! am I the Town-talk? [_Aside_]\n\n_Har._ I can neither see Doricourt nor Letty.--I must find them out.\n[_Exit_ Hardy.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Well, Lady Frances, is not all this charming? Could you\nhave conceived such a brilliant assemblage of objects?\n\n_Lady Fran._ Delightful! The days of enchantment are restor'd; the\ncolumns glow with Sapphires and Rubies. Emperors and Fairies, Beauties\nand Dwarfs, meet me at every step.\n\n_Sir Geo._ How lively are first impressions on sensible minds! In four\nhours, vapidity and languor will take place of that exquisite sense of\njoy, which flutters your little heart.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ What an inhuman creature! Fate has not allow'd us these\nsensations above ten times in our lives; and would you have us shorten\nthem by anticipation?\n\n_Flut._ O Lord! your Wise Men are the greatest Fools upon earth:--they\nreason about their enjoyments, and analyse their pleasures, whilst the\nessence escapes. Look, Lady Frances: D'ye see that Figure strutting in\nthe dress of an Emperor? His Father retails Oranges in Botolph Lane.\nThat Gypsey is a Maid of Honour, and that Rag-man a Physician.\n\n_Lady Fran._ Why, you know every body.\n\n_Flut._ Oh, every creature.--A Mask is nothing at all to me.--I can give\nyou the history of half the people here. In the next apartment there's a\nwhole family, who, to my knowledge, have lived on Water-Cresses this\nmonth, to make a figure here to-night;--but, to make up for that,\nthey'll cram their pockets with cold Ducks and Chickens, for a Carnival\nto-morrow.\n\n_Lady Fran._ Oh, I should like to see this provident Family.\n\n_Flut._ Honour me with your arm. [_Exeunt_ Flutter _and Lady_ Frances.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Come, Sir George, you shall be _my_ Beau.--We'll make the\n_tour_ of the rooms, and meet them. Oh! your pardon, you must follow\nLady Frances; or the wit and fine parts of Mr. Flutter may drive you out\nof her head. Ha! ha! ha! [_Exit Mrs._ Racket.\n\n_Sir Geo._ I was going to follow her, and now I dare not. How can I be\nsuch a fool as to be govern'd by the _fear_ of that ridicule which I\ndespise! [_Exit Sir_ George.\n\n      _Enter_ Doricourt, _meeting a Mask_.\n\n_Doric._ Ha! my Lord!--I thought you had been engaged at Westminster on\nthis important night.\n\n_Mask._ So I am--I slipt out as soon as Lord Trope got upon his legs;\nI can _badinage_ here an hour or two, and be back again before he is\ndown.----There's a fine Figure! I'll address her.\n\n      _Enter_ Letitia.\n\nCharity, fair Lady! Charity for a poor Pilgrim.\n\n_Letit._ Charity! If you mean my prayers, Heaven grant thee Wit,\nPilgrim.\n\n_Mask._ That blessing would do from a Devotee: from you I ask other\ncharities;--such charities as Beauty should bestow--soft Looks--sweet\nWords--and kind Wishes.\n\n_Letit._ Alas! I am bankrupt of these, and forced to turn Beggar\nmyself.----There he is!--how shall I catch his attention?\n\n_Mask._ Will you grant me no favour?\n\n_Letit._ Yes, one--I'll make you my Partner--not for life, but through\nthe soft mazes of a minuet.--Dare you dance?\n\n_Doric._ Some spirit in that.\n\n_Mask._ I dare do any thing you command.\n\n_Doric._ Do you know her, my Lord?\n\n_Mask._ No: Such a woman as that, would formerly have been known in any\ndisguise; but Beauty is now common--Venus seems to have given her\n_Cestus_ to the whole sex.\n\n      _A Minuet._\n\n_Doric._ (_during the Minuet_) She dances divinely.--(_When ended_)\nSomebody must know her! Let us enquire who she is. [_Exit._\n\n      _Enter_ Saville _and_ Kitty Willis, _habited like Lady_\n      Frances.\n\n_Sav._ I have seen Courtall in Sir George's habit, though he\nendeavoured to keep himself conceal'd. Go, and seat yourself in the\ntea-room, and on no account discover your face:--remember too, Kitty,\nthat the Woman you are to personate is a Woman of Virtue.\n\n_Kitty._ I am afraid I shall find that a difficult character: indeed I\nbelieve it is seldom kept up through a whole Masquerade.\n\n_Sav._ Of that _you_ can be no judge----Follow my directions, and you\nshall be rewarded. [_Exit_ Kitty.\n\n      _Enter_ Doricourt.\n\n_Dor._ Ha! Saville! Did you see a Lady dance just now?\n\n_Sav._ No.\n\n_Dor._ Very odd. No body knows her.\n\n_Sav._ Where is Miss Hardy?\n\n_Dor._ Cutting Watch-papers, and making Conundrums, I suppose.\n\n_Sav._ What do you mean?\n\n_Dor._ Faith, I hardly know. She's not here, however, Mrs. Racket tells\nme.--I ask'd no further.\n\n_Sav._ Your indifference seems increas'd.\n\n_Dor._ Quite the reverse; 'tis advanced thirty-two degrees towards\nhatred.\n\n_Sav._ You are jesting?\n\n_Dor._ Then it must be with a very ill grace, my dear Saville; for I\nnever felt so seriously: Do you know the creature's almost an Ideot?\n\n_Sav._ What!\n\n_Dor._ An Ideot. What the devil shall I do with her? Egad! I think I'll\nfeign myself mad--and then Hardy will propose to cancel the engagements.\n\n_Sav._ An excellent expedient. I must leave you; you are mysterious, and\nI can't stay to unravel ye.--I came here to watch over Innocence and\nBeauty.\n\n_Dor._ The Guardian of Innocence and Beauty at three and twenty! Is\nthere not a cloven foot under that black gown, Saville?\n\n_Sav._ No, faith. Courtall is here on a most detestable design.--I\nfound means to get a knowledge of the Lady's dress, and have brought a\ngirl to personate her, whose reputation cannot be hurt.--You shall know\nthe result to-morrow. Adieu. [_Exit_ Saville.\n\n_Dor._ (_musing_) Yes, I think that will do.--I'll feign myself mad, see\nthe Doctor to pronounce me incurable, and when the parchments are\ndestroyed----\n\n      [_As he stands in a musing posture_, Letitia _enters, and\n      sings_.]\n\n\nSONG.\n\n  _Wake! thou Son of Dullness, wake!_\n    _From thy drowsy senses shake_\n  _All the spells that Care employs,_\n    _Cheating Mortals of their joys._\n\n  II.\n\n  _Light-wing'd Spirits, hither haste!_\n    _Who prepare for mortal taste_\n  _All the gifts that Pleasure sends,_\n    _Every bliss that youth attends._\n\n  III.\n\n  _Touch his feelings, rouze his soul,_\n    _Whilst the sparkling moments roll;_\n  _Bid them wake to new delight,_\n    _Crown the magic of the night._\n\n_Dor._ By Heaven, the same sweet creature!\n\n_Let._ You have chosen an odd situation for study. Fashion and Taste\npreside in this spot:--they throw their spells around you:--ten thousand\ndelights spring up at their command;--and you, a Stoic--a being without\nsenses, are wrapt in reflection.\n\n_Dor._ And you, the most charming being in the world, awake me to\nadmiration. Did you come from the Stars?\n\n_Let._ Yes, and I shall reascend in a moment.\n\n_Dor._ Pray shew me your face before you go.\n\n_Let._ Beware of imprudent curiosity; it lost Paradise.\n\n_Dor._ Eve's curiosity was rais'd by the Devil;--'tis an Angel tempts\nmine.--So your allusion is not in point.\n\n_Let._ But _why_ would you see my face?\n\n_Dor._ To fall in love with it.\n\n_Let._ And what then?\n\n_Dor._ Why, then--Aye, curse it! there's the rub. [_Aside._]\n\n_Let._ Your Mistress will be angry;--but, perhaps, you have no Mistress?\n\n_Dor._ Yes, yes; and a sweet one it is!\n\n_Let._ What! is she old?\n\n_Dor._ No.\n\n_Let._ Ugly?\n\n_Dor._ No.\n\n_Let._ What then?\n\n_Dor._ Pho! don't talk about _her_; but shew me your face.\n\n_Let._ My vanity forbids it;--'twould frighten you.\n\n_Dor._ Impossible! Your Shape is graceful, your Air bewitching, your\nBosom transparent, and your Chin would tempt me to kiss it, if I did not\nsee a pouting red Lip above it, that demands----\n\n_Let._ You grow too free.\n\n_Dor._ Shew me your face then--only half a glance.\n\n_Let._ Not for worlds.\n\n_Dor._ What! you will have a little gentle force? [_Attempts to seize\nher Mask._\n\n_Let._ I am gone for ever! [_Exit._\n\n_Dor._ 'Tis false;--I'll follow to the end. [_Exit._\n\n      Flutter, _Lady_ Frances, _and_ Saville _advance_.\n\n_Lady Fran._ How can you be thus interested for a stranger?\n\n_Sav._ Goodness will ever interest; its home is Heaven: on earth 'tis\nbut a Wanderer. Imprudent Lady! why have you left the side of your\nProtector? Where is your Husband?\n\n_Flut._ Why, what's that to him?\n\n_Lady Fran._ Surely it can't be merely his habit;----there's something\nin him that awes me.\n\n_Flut._ Pho! 'tis only his grey beard.--I know him; he keeps a\nLottery-office on Cornhill.\n\n_Sav._ My province, as an Enchanter, lays open every secret to me. Lady!\nthere are dangers abroad--Beware! [_Exit._\n\n_Lady Fran._ 'Tis very odd; his manner has made me tremble. Let us seek\nSir George.\n\n_Flut._ He is coming towards us.\n\n      Courtall _comes forward, habited like Sir_ George.\n\n_Court._ There she is! If I can but disengage her from that fool\nFlutter--crown me, ye Schemers, with immortal wreaths.\n\n_Lady Fran._ O my dear Sir George! I rejoice to meet you--an old\nConjuror has been frightening me with his Prophecies.--Where's Mrs.\nRacket?\n\n_Court._ In the dancing-room.--I promis'd to send you to her, Mr.\nFlutter.\n\n_Flut._ Ah! she wants me to dance. With all my heart. [_Exit._\n\n_Lady Fran._ Why do you keep on your mask?--'tis too warm.\n\n_Court._ 'Tis very warm--I want air--let us go.\n\n_Lady Fran._ You seem quite agitated.----Sha'n't we bid our company\nadieu?\n\n_Court._ No, no;--there's no time for forms. I'll just give directions\nto the carriage, and be with you in a moment. (_Going, steps back._) Put\non your mask; I have a particular reason for it. [_Exit._\n\n      Saville _advances with_ Kitty.\n\n_Sav._ Now, Kitty, you know your lesson. Lady Frances, (_takes off his\nmask_) let me lead you to your Husband.\n\n_Lady Fran._ Heavens! is Mr. Saville the Conjuror? Sir George is just\nstept to the door to give directions.--We are going home immediately.\n\n_Sav._ No, Madam, you are deceiv'd: Sir George is this way.\n\n_Lady Fran._ This is astonishing!\n\n_Sav._ Be not alarm'd: you have escap'd a snare, and shall be in safety\nin a moment. [_Exit_ Saville _and Lady_ Frances.\n\n      _Enter_ Courtall, _and seizes_ Kitty's _Hand_.\n\n_Court._ Now!\n\n_Kitty._ 'Tis pity to go so soon.\n\n_Court._ Perhaps I may bring you back, my Angel----but go now, you must.\n[_Exit._] [_Music._]\n\n      Doricourt _and_ Letitia _come forward_.\n\n_Dor._ By Heavens! I never was charm'd till now.--English beauty--French\nvivacity--wit--elegance. Your name, my Angel!--tell me your name, though\nyou persist in concealing your face.\n\n_Let._ My name has a spell in it.\n\n_Dor._ I thought so; it must be _Charming_.\n\n_Let._ But if reveal'd, the charm is broke.\n\n_Dor._ I'll answer for its force.\n\n_Let._ Suppose it Harriet, or Charlotte, or Maria, or--\n\n_Dor._ Hang Harriet, and Charlotte, and Maria--the name your Father gave\nye!\n\n_Let._ That can't be worth knowing, 'tis so transient a thing.\n\n_Dor._ How, transient?\n\n_Let._ Heav'n forbid my name should be _lasting_ till I am married.\n\n_Dor._ Married! The chains of Matrimony are too heavy and vulgar for\nsuch a spirit as yours.----The flowery wreaths of Cupid are the only\nbands you should wear.\n\n_Let._ They are the lightest, I believe: but 'tis possible to wear those\nof Marriage gracefully.----Throw 'em loosely round, and twist 'em in a\nTrue-Lover's Knot for the Bosom.\n\n_Dor._ An Angel! But what will you be when a Wife?\n\n_Let._ A Woman.--If my Husband should prove a Churl, a Fool, or a\nTyrant, I'd break his heart, ruin his fortune, elope with the first\npretty Fellow that ask'd me--and return the contempt of the world with\nscorn, whilst my feelings prey'd upon my life.\n\n_Dor._ Amazing! [_Aside_] What if you lov'd him, and he were worthy of\nyour love?\n\n_Let._ Why, then I'd be any thing--and all!--Grave, gay, capricious--the\nsoul of whim, the spirit of variety--live with him in the eye of\nfashion, or in the shade of retirement----change my country, my\nsex,--feast with him in an Esquimaux hut, or a Persian pavilion--join\nhim in the victorious war-dance on the borders of Lake Ontario, or\nsleep to the soft breathings of the flute in the cinnamon groves of\nCeylon--dig with him in the mines of Golconda, or enter the dangerous\nprecincts of the Mogul's Seraglo----cheat him of his wishes, and\noverturn his empire to restore the Husband of my Heart to the blessings\nof Liberty and Love.\n\n_Dor._ Delightful wildness! Oh, to catch thee, and hold thee for ever in\nthis little cage! [_Attempting to clasp her._\n\n_Let._ Hold, Sir! Though Cupid must give the bait that tempts me to the\nsnare, 'tis Hymen must spread the net to catch me.\n\n_Dor._ 'Tis in vain to assume airs of coldness----Fate has ordain'd you\nmine.\n\n_Let._ How do you know?\n\n_Dor._ I feel it _here_. I never met with a Woman so perfectly to my\ntaste; and I won't believe it form'd you so, on purpose to tantalize me.\n\n_Let._ This moment is worth a whole existence. [_Aside._]\n\n_Dor._ Come, shew me your face, and rivet my chains.\n\n_Let._ To-morrow you shall be satisfied.\n\n_Dor._ To-morrow! and not to-night?\n\n_Let._ No.\n\n_Dor._ Where then shall I wait on you to-morrow?----Where see you?\n\n_Let._ You shall see me in an hour when you least expect me.\n\n_Dor._ Why all this mystery?\n\n_Let._ I like to be mysterious. At present be content to know that I am\na Woman of Family and Fortune. Adieu!\n\n      _Enter_ Hardy.\n\n_Har._ Adieu! Then I am come at the fag end. [_Aside._]\n\n_Dor._ Let me see you to your carriage.\n\n_Let._ As you value knowing me, stir not a step. If I am follow'd, you\nnever see me more. [_Exit._\n\n_Dor._ Barbarous Creature! She's gone! What, and is this really\nserious?--am I in love?----Pho! it can't be----O Flutter! do you know\nthat charming Creature?\n\n      _Enter_ Flutter.\n\n_Flut._ What charming Creature? I pass'd a thousand.\n\n_Dor._ She went out at that door, as you enter'd.\n\n_Flut._ Oh, yes;--I know her very well.\n\n_Dor._ Do you, my dear Fellow? Who?\n\n_Flut._ She's kept by Lord George Jennett.\n\n_Har._ Impudent Scoundrel! [_Aside._]\n\n_Dor._ Kept!!!\n\n_Flut._ Yes; Colonel Gorget had her first;--then Mr. Loveill;--then--I\nforget exactly how many; and at last she's Lord George's. [_Talks to\nother Masks._]\n\n_Dor._ I'll murder Gorget, poison Lord George, and shoot myself.\n\n_Har._ Now's the time, I see, to clear up the whole. Mr. Doricourt!--I\nsay--Flutter was mistaken; I know who you are in love with.\n\n_Dor._ A strange _rencontre_! Who?\n\n_Har._ My Letty.\n\n_Dor._ Oh! I understand your rebuke;--'tis too soon, Sir, to assume the\nFather-in-law.\n\n_Har._ Zounds! what do you mean by that? I tell you that the Lady you\nadmire, is Letitia Hardy.\n\n_Dor._ I am glad _you_ are so well satisfied with the state of my\nheart.--I wish _I_ was. [_Exit._\n\n_Har._ Stop a moment.--Stop, I say! What, you won't? Very well--if I\ndon't play you a trick for this, may I never be a Grand-father! I'll\nplot _with_ Letty now, and not against her; aye, hang me if I don't.\nThere's something in my head, that shall tingle in his heart.--He shall\nhave a lecture upon impatience, that I foresee he'll be the better for\nas long as he lives. [_Exit._\n\n      Saville _comes forward with other Masks_.\n\n_Sav._ Flutter, come with us; we're going to raise a laugh at\nCourtall's.\n\n_Flut._ With all my heart. \"Live to Live,\" was my Father's motto: \"Live\nto Laugh,\" is mine. [_Exit._\n\n\nSCENE----Courtall's.\n\n_Enter_ Kitty _and_ Courtall.\n\n_Kitty._ Where have you brought me, Sir George? This is not our home.\n\n_Court._ 'Tis _my_ home, beautiful Lady Frances! [_Kneels, and takes off\nhis Mask._] Oh, forgive the ardency of my passion, which has compell'd\nme to deceive you.\n\n_Kitty._ Mr. Courtall! what will become of me?\n\n_Court._ Oh, say but that you pardon the Wretch who adores you. Did you\nbut know the agonizing tortures of my heart, since I had the felicity of\nconversing with you this morning----or the despair that now--[_Knock._]\n\n_Kitty._ Oh! I'm undone!\n\n_Court._ Zounds! my dear Lady Frances. I am not at home. Rascal! do you\nhear?----Let no body in; I am not at home.\n\n_Serv._ [_Without_] Sir, I told the Gentlemen so.\n\n_Court._ Eternal curses! they are coming up. Step into this room,\nadorable Creature! _one_ moment; I'll throw them out of the window if\nthey stay three. [_Exit_ Kitty; _through the back scene_.\n\n      _Enter_ Saville, Flutter, _and Masks_.\n\n_Flut._ O Gemini! beg the Petticoat's pardon.--Just saw a corner of it.\n\n_1st Mask._ No wonder admittance was so difficult. I thought you took us\nfor Bailiffs.\n\n_Court._ Upon my soul, I am devilish glad to see you--but you perceive\nhow I am circumstanc'd. Excuse me at this moment.\n\n_2d Mask._ Tell us who 'tis then.\n\n_Court._ Oh, fie!\n\n_Flut._ We won't blab.\n\n_Court._ I can't, upon honour.--Thus far--She's a Woman of the first\nCharacter and Rank. Saville, [_takes him aside_] have I influence, or\nhave I not?\n\n_Sav._ Why, sure, you do not insinuate--\n\n_Court._ No, not insinuate, but swear, that she's now in my\nbed-chamber:--by gad, I don't deceive you.--There's Generalship, you\nRogue! Such an humble, distant, sighing Fellow as thou art, at the end\nof a six-months siege, would have _boasted_ of a kiss from her\nglove.----I only give the signal, and--pop!--she's in my arms.\n\n_Sav._ What, Lady Fran----\n\n_Court._ Hush! You shall see her name to-morrow morning in red letters\nat the end of my list. Gentlemen, you must excuse me now. Come and drink\nchocolate at twelve, but--\n\n_Sav._ Aye, let us go, out of respect to the Lady:--'tis a Person of\nRank.\n\n_Flut._ Is it?--Then I'll have a peep at her. (_Runs to the door in the\nback Scene._)\n\n_Court._ This is too much, Sir. (_Trying to prevent him._)\n\n_1st Mask._ By Jupiter, we'll all have a peep.\n\n_Court._ Gentlemen, consider--for Heaven's sake----a Lady of Quality.\nWhat will be the consequences?\n\n_Flut._ The consequences!--Why, you'll have your throat cut, that's\nall--but I'll write your Elegy. So, now for the door! [_Part open the\ndoor, whilst the rest hold_ Courtall.]----Beg your Ladyship's pardon,\nwhoever you are: [_Leads her out._] Emerge from darkness like the\nglorious Sun, and bless the wond'ring circle with your charms. [_Takes\noff her Mask._]\n\n_Sav._ Kitty Willis! ha! ha! ha!\n\n_Omnes._ Kitty Willis! ha! ha! ha! Kitty Willis!\n\n_1st Mask._ Why, what a Fellow you are, Courtall, to attempt imposing on\nyour friends in this manner! A Lady of Quality--an Earl's Daughter--Your\nLadyship's most obedient.----Ha! ha! ha!\n\n_Sav._ Courtall, have you influence, or have you not?\n\n_Flut._ The Man's moon-struck.\n\n_Court._ Hell, and ten thousand Furies, seize you all together!\n\n_Kitty._ What! me, too, Mr. Courtall? me, whom you have knelt to, prayed\nto, and adored?\n\n_Flut._ That's right, Kitty; give him a little more.\n\n_Court._ Disappointed and laugh'd at!----\n\n_Sav._ Laugh'd at and despis'd. I have fullfilled my design, which was\nto expose your villainy, and laugh at your presumption. Adieu, Sir!\nRemember how you again boast of your influence with Women of Rank; and,\nwhen you next want amusement, dare not to look up to the virtuous and to\nthe noble for a Companion. [_Exit, leading_ Kitty.\n\n_Flut._ And, Courtall, before you carry a Lady into your bed-chamber\nagain, look under her mask, d'ye hear? [_Exit._\n\n_Court._ There's no bearing this! I'll set off for Paris directly.\n[_Exit._\n\nEND OF THE FOURTH ACT.\n\n\n\n\nACT V.\n\n\nSCENE I.----_Hardy_'s.\n\n_Enter_ Hardy _and_ Villers.\n\n\n_Villers._\n\nWhimsical enough! Dying for her, and hates her; believes her a Fool, and\na Woman of brilliant Understanding!\n\n_Har._ As true as you are alive;--but when I went up to him last night,\nat the Pantheon, out of downright good-nature to explain things----my\nGentleman whips round upon his heel, and snapt me as short as if I had\nbeen a beggar-woman with six children, and he Overseer of the Parish.\n\n_Vill._ Here comes the Wonder-worker--[_Enter_ Letitia.] Here comes the\nEnchantress, who can go to Masquerades, and sing and dance, and talk a\nMan out of his wits!----But pray, have we Morning Masquerades?\n\n_Let._ Oh, no--but I am so enamour'd of this all-conquering Habit, that\nI could not resist putting it on, the moment I had breakfasted. I shall\nwear it on the day I am married, and then lay it by in spices--like the\nmiraculous Robes of St. Bridget.\n\n_Vill._ That's as most Brides do. The charms that helped to catch the\nHusband, are generally _laid by_, one after another, 'till the Lady\ngrows a downright Wife, and then runs crying to her Mother, because she\nhas transform'd her _Lover_ into a downright Husband.\n\n_Har._ Listen to me.--I ha'n't slept to-night, for thinking of plots to\nplague Doricourt;--and they drove one another out of my head so quick,\nthat I was as giddy as a goose, and could make nothing of 'em.----I wish\nto goodness you could contrive something.\n\n_Vill._ Contrive to plague him! Nothing so easy. Don't undeceive him,\nMadam, 'till he is your Husband. Marry him whilst he possesses the\nsentiments you labour'd to give him of Miss Hardy--and when you are his\nWife----\n\n_Let._ Oh, Heavens! I see the whole--that's the very thing. My dear Mr.\nVillers, you are the divinest Man.\n\n_Vill._ Don't make love to me, Hussey.\n\n      _Enter Mrs._ Racket.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ No, pray don't--for I design to have Villers myself in\nabout six years.--There's an oddity in him that pleases me.--He holds\nWomen in contempt; and I should like to have an opportunity of breaking\nhis heart for that.\n\n_Vill._ And when I am heartily tired of life, I know no Woman whom I\nwould with more pleasure make my Executioner.\n\n_Har._ It cannot be----I foresee it will be impossible to bring it\nabout. You know the wedding wasn't to take place this week or more--and\nLetty will never be able to play the Fool so long.\n\n_Vill._ The knot shall be tied to-night.----I have it all here,\n(_pointing to his forehead:_) the licence is ready. Feign yourself ill,\nsend for Doricourt, and tell him you can't go out of the world in peace,\nexcept you see the ceremony performed.\n\n_Har._ I feign myself ill! I could as soon feign myself a Roman\nAmbassador.----I was never ill in my life, but with the tooth-ach--when\nLetty's Mother was a breeding I had all the qualms.\n\n_Vill._ Oh, I have no fears for _you_.--But what says Miss Hardy? Are\nyou willing to make the irrevocable vow before night?\n\n_Let._ Oh, Heavens!--I--I--'Tis so exceeding sudden, that really----\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ That really she is frighten'd out of her wits--lest it\nshould be impossible to bring matters about. But _I_ have taken the\nscheme into my protection, and you shall be Mrs. Doricourt before night.\nCome, [_to Mr._ Hardy] to bed directly: your room shall be cramm'd with\nphials, and all the apparatus of Death;----then heigh presto! for\nDoricourt.\n\n_Vill._ You go and put off your conquering dress, [_to_ Letty] and get\nall your aukward airs ready--And you practise a few groans [_to_\nHardy.]--And you--if possible--an air of gravity [_to Mrs._ Racket].\nI'll answer for the plot.\n\n_Let._ Married in jest! 'Tis an odd idea! Well, I'll venture it.\n[_Exit_ Letitia _and Mrs._ Racket.\n\n_Vill._ Aye, I'll be sworn! [_looks at his watch_] 'tis past three.\nThe Budget's to be open'd this morning. I'll just step down to the\nHouse.----Will you go?\n\n_Har._ What! with a mortal sickness?\n\n_Vill._ What a Blockhead! I believe, if half of us were to stay away\nwith mortal sicknesses, it would be for the health of the Nation.\nGood-morning.--I'll call and feel your pulse as I come back. [_Exit._\n\n_Har._ You won't find 'em over brisk, I fancy. I foresee some ill\nhappening from this making believe to die before one's time. But hang\nit--a-hem!--I am a stout man yet; only fifty-six--What's that? In\nthe last Yearly Bill there were three lived to above an hundred.\nFifty-six!----Fiddle-de-dee! I am not afraid, not I. [_Exit._\n\n\nSCENE II.----_Doricourt_'s.\n\nDoricourt _in his Robe-de-Chambre_.\n\n_Enter_ Saville.\n\n_Sav._ Undress'd so late?\n\n_Doric._ I didn't go to bed 'till late--'twas late before I slept--late\nwhen I rose. Do you know Lord George Jennett?\n\n_Sav._ Yes.\n\n_Doric._ Has he a Mistress?\n\n_Sav._ Yes.\n\n_Doric._ What sort of a creature is she?\n\n_Sav._ Why, she spends him three thousand a year with the ease of a\nDuchess, and entertains his friends with the grace of a _Ninon_.\n_Ergo_, she is handsome, spirited, and clever. [Doricourt _walks about\ndisordered_.] In the name of Caprice, what ails you?\n\n_Doric._ You have hit it--_Elle est mon Caprice_--The Mistress of Lord\nGeorge Jennett is my caprice--Oh, insufferable!\n\n_Sav._ What, you saw her at the Masquerade?\n\n_Doric._ _Saw_ her, _lov'd_ her, _died_ for her--without knowing\nher--And now the curse is, I can't hate her.\n\n_Sav._ Ridiculous enough! All this distress about a Kept Woman, whom any\nman may have, I dare swear, in a fortnight--They've been jarring some\ntime.\n\n_Doric._ Have her! The sentiment I have conceived for the Witch is so\nunaccountable, that, in that line, I cannot bear her idea. Was she a\nWoman of Honour, for a Wife, I cou'd adore her--but, I really believe,\nif she should send me an assignation, I should hate her.\n\n_Sav._ Hey-day! This sounds like Love. What becomes of poor Miss Hardy?\n\n_Doric._ Her name has given me an ague. Dear Saville, how shall I\ncontrive to make old Hardy cancel the engagements! The moiety of the\nestate which he will forfeit, shall be his the next moment, by deed of\ngift.\n\n_Sav._ Let me see--Can't you get it insinuated that you are a dev'lish\nwild fellow; that you are an Infidel, and attached to wenching, gaming,\nand so forth?\n\n_Doric._ Aye, such a character might have done some good two centuries\nback.----But who the devil can it frighten now? I believe it must be the\nmad scheme, at last.--There, will that do for the grin?\n\n_Sav._ Ridiculous!--But, how are you certain that the Woman who has so\nbewildered you, belongs to Lord George?\n\n_Doric._ Flutter told me so.\n\n_Sav._ Then fifty to one against the intelligence.\n\n_Doric._ It must be so. There was a mystery in her manner, for which\nnothing else can account. [_A violent rap._] Who can this be? [Saville\n_looks out_.]\n\n_Sav._ The proverb is your answer--'tis Flutter himself. Tip him a scene\nof the Mad-man, and see how it takes.\n\n_Doric._ I will--a good way to send it about town. Shall it be of the\nmelancholy kind, or the raving?\n\n_Sav._ Rant!--rant!--Here he comes.\n\n_Doric._ Talk not to me who can pull comets by the beard, and overset an\nisland!\n\n      _Enter_ Flutter.\n\nThere! This is he!--this is he who hath sent my poor soul, without coat\nor breeches, to be tossed about in ether like a duck-feather! Villain,\ngive me my soul again!\n\n_Flut._ Upon my soul I hav'n't got it. [_Exceedingly frightened._]\n\n_Sav._ Oh, Mr. Flutter, what a melancholy sight!----I little thought to\nhave seen my poor friend reduced to this.\n\n_Flut._ Mercy defend me! What's he mad?\n\n_Sav._ You see how it is. A cursed Italian Lady--Jealousy--gave him a\ndrug; and every full of the moon----\n\n_Doric._ Moon! Who dares talk of the Moon? The patroness of genius--the\nrectifier of wits--the----Oh! here she is!--I feel her--she tugs at my\nbrain--she has it--she has it----Oh! [_Exit._\n\n_Flut._ Well! this is dreadful! exceeding dreadful, I protest. Have you\nhad Monro?\n\n_Sav._ Not yet. The worthy Miss Hardy--what a misfortune!\n\n_Flut._ Aye, very true.--Do they know it?\n\n_Sav._ Oh, no; the paroxysm seized him but this morning.\n\n_Flut._ Adieu! I can't stay. [_Going in great haste._]\n\n_Sav._ But you must. (_holding him_) Stay, and assist me:--perhaps he'll\nreturn again in a moment; and, when he is in this way, his strength is\nprodigious.\n\n_Flut._ Can't indeed--can't upon my soul. [_Exit._\n\n_Sav._ Flutter--Don't make a mistake, now;--remember 'tis Doricourt\nthat's mad. [_Exit._\n\n_Flut._ Yes--you mad.\n\n_Sav._ No, no; Doricourt.\n\n_Flut._ Egad, I'll say you are both mad, and then I can't mistake.\n[_Exeunt severally._\n\n\nSCENE III.----_Sir_ George Touchwood'_s_.\n\n_Enter Sir_ George, _and Lady_ Frances.\n\n_Sir Geo._ The bird is escaped--Courtall is gone to France.\n\n_Lady Fran._ Heaven and earth! Have ye been to seek him?\n\n_Sir Geo._ Seek him! Aye.\n\n_Lady Fran._ How did you get his name? I should never have told it you.\n\n_Sir Geo._ I learnt it in the first Coffee-house I entered.--Every body\nis full of the story.\n\n_Lady Fran._ Thank Heaven! he's gone!--But I have a story for you--The\nHardy family are forming a plot upon your Friend Doricourt, and we are\nexpected in the evening to assist.\n\n_Sir Geo._ With all my heart, my Angel; but I can't stay to hear it\nunfolded. They told me Mr. Saville would be at home in half an hour,\nand I am impatient to see him. The adventure of last night----\n\n_Lady Fran._ Think of it only with gratitude. The danger I was in has\noverset a new system of conduct, that, perhaps, I was too much inclined\nto adopt. But henceforward, my dear Sir George, you shall be my constant\nCompanion, and Protector. And, when they ridicule the unfashionable\nMonsters, the felicity of our hearts shall make their satire pointless.\n\n_Sir Geo._ Charming Angel! You almost reconcile me to Courtall. Hark!\nhere's company (_stepping to the door._) 'Tis your lively Widow--I'll\nstep down the back stairs, to escape her. [_Exit Sir_ George.\n\n      _Enter Mrs._ Racket.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Oh, Lady Frances! I am shock'd to death.--Have you received\na card from us?\n\n_Lady Fran._ Yes; within these twenty minutes.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Aye, 'tis of no consequence.----'Tis all over--Doricourt is\nmad.\n\n_Lady Fran._ Mad!\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ My poor Letitia!--Just as we were enjoying ourselves with\nthe prospect of a scheme that was planned for their mutual happiness, in\ncame Flutter, breathless, with the intelligence:--I flew here to know if\nyou had heard it.\n\n_Lady Fran._ No, indeed--and I hope it is one of Mr. Flutter's dreams.\n\n      _Enter_ Saville.\n\nA-propos; now we shall be informed. Mr. Saville, I rejoice to see you,\nthough Sir George will be disappointed: he's gone to your lodgings.\n\n_Sav._ I should have been happy to have prevented Sir George. I hope\nyour Ladyship's adventure last night did not disturb your dreams?\n\n_Lady Fran._ Not at all; for I never slept a moment. My escape, and the\nimportance of my obligations to you, employed my thoughts. But we have\njust had shocking intelligence--Is it true that Doricourt is mad?\n\n_Sav._ So; the business is done. (_Aside._) Madam, I am sorry to say,\nthat I have just been a melancholy witness of his ravings: he was in the\nheight of a paroxysm.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Oh, there can be no doubt of it. Flutter told us the whole\nhistory. Some Italian Princess gave him a drug, in a box of sweetmeats,\nsent to him by her own page; and it renders him lunatic every month.\nPoor Miss Hardy! I never felt so much on any occasion in my life.\n\n_Sav._ To soften your concern, I will inform you, Madam, that Miss\nHardy is less to be pitied than you imagine.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Why so, Sir?\n\n_Sav._ 'Tis rather a delicate subject--but he did not love Miss Hardy.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ He did love Miss Hardy, Sir, and would have been the\nhappiest of men.\n\n_Sav._ Pardon me, Madam; his heart was not only free from that Lady's\nchains, but absolutely captivated by another.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ No, Sir--no. It was Miss Hardy who captivated him. She met\nhim last night at the Masquerade, and charmed him in disguise--He\nprofessed the most violent passion for her; and a plan was laid, this\nevening, to cheat him into happiness.\n\n_Sav._ Ha! ha! ha!--Upon my soul, I must beg your pardon; I have not\neaten of the Italian Princess's box of sweetmeats, sent by her own page;\nand yet I am as mad as Doricourt, ha! ha! ha!\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ So it appears--What can all this mean?\n\n_Sav._ Why, Madam, he is at present in his perfect senses; but he'll\nlose 'em in ten minutes, through joy.--The madness was only a feint, to\navoid marrying Miss Hardy, ha! ha! ha!--I'll carry him the intelligence\ndirectly. (_Going._)\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Not for worlds. I owe him revenge, now, for what he has\nmade us suffer. You must promise not to divulge a syllable I have told\nyou; and when Doricourt is summoned to Mr. Hardy's, prevail on him to\ncome--madness, and all.\n\n_Lady Fran._ Pray do. I should like to see him shewing off, now I am in\nthe secret.\n\n_Sav._ You must be obeyed; though 'tis inhuman to conceal his happiness.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ I am going home; so I'll set you down at his lodgings, and\nacquaint you, by the way, with our whole scheme. _Allons!_\n\n_Sav._ I attend you (_leading her out._)\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ You won't fail us? [_Exit_ Saville, _and Mrs._ Racket.\n\n_Lady Fran._ No; depend on us. [_Exit._\n\n\nSCENE IV.----Doricourt'_s_.\n\nDoricourt _seated, reading_.\n\n_Doric._ (_flings away the book_) What effect can the morals of\nFourscore have on a mind torn with passion? (_musing_) Is it possible\nsuch a soul as her's, can support itself in so humiliating a situation?\nA kept Woman! (_rising_) Well, well--I am glad it is so--I am glad it is\nso!\n\n      _Enter_ Saville.\n\n_Sav._ What a happy dog you are, Doricourt! I might have been mad, or\nbeggar'd, or pistol'd myself, without its being mentioned--But you,\nforsooth! the whole Female World is concerned for. I reported the state\nof your brain to five different women--The lip of the first trembled;\nthe white bosom of the second heaved a sigh; the third ejaculated, and\nturned her eye--to the glass; the fourth blessed herself; and the fifth\nsaid, whilst she pinned a curl, \"Well, now, perhaps, he'll be an amusing\nCompanion; his native dullness was intolerable.\"\n\n_Doric._ Envy! sheer envy, by the smiles of Hebe!----There are not less\nthan forty pair of the brightest eyes in town will drop crystals, when\nthey hear of my misfortune.\n\n_Sav._ Well, but I have news for you:--Poor Hardy is confined to his\nbed; they say he is going out of the world by the first post, and he\nwants to give you his blessing.\n\n_Doric._ Ill! so ill! I am sorry from my soul. He's a worthy little\nFellow--if he had not the gift of foreseeing so strongly.\n\n_Sav._ Well; you must go and take leave.\n\n_Doric._ What! to act the Lunatic in the dying Man's chamber?\n\n_Sav._ Exactly the thing; and will bring your business to a short issue:\nfor his last commands must be, That you are not to marry his Daughter.\n\n_Doric._ That's true, by Jupiter!--and yet, hang it, impose upon a poor\nfellow at so serious a moment!--I can't do it.\n\n_Sav._ You must, 'faith. I am answerable for your appearance, though it\nshould be in a strait waistcoat. He knows your situation, and seems the\nmore desirous of an interview.\n\n_Doric._ I don't like encountering Racket.--She's an arch little devil,\nand will discover the cheat.\n\n_Sav._ There's a fellow!--Cheated Ninety-nine Women, and now afraid of\nthe Hundredth.\n\n_Doric._ And with reason--for that hundredth is a Widow. [_Exeunt._\n\n\nSCENE V.----_Hardy_'s.\n\n_Enter Mrs._ Racket, _and Miss_ Ogle.\n\n_Miss Ogle._ And so Miss Hardy is actually to be married to-night?\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ If her Fate does not deceive her. You are apprised of the\nscheme, and we hope it will succeed.\n\n_Miss Ogle._ Deuce, take her! she's six years younger than I am.\n(_Aside_)--Is Mr. Doricourt handsome?\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Handsome, generous, young, and rich.----There's a Husband\nfor ye! Isn't he worth pulling caps for?\n\n_Miss Ogle._ I' my conscience, the Widow speaks as though she'd give\ncap, ears, and all for him. (_Aside._) I wonder you didn't try to catch\nthis wonderful Man, Mrs. Racket?\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Really, Miss Ogle, I had not time. Besides, when I marry,\nso many stout young fellows will hang themselves, that, out of regard to\nsociety, in these sad times, I shall postpone it for a few years. This\nwill cost her a new lace--I heard it crack. (_Aside._)\n\n      _Enter Sir_ George, _and Lady_ Frances.\n\n_Sir Geo._ Well, here we are.--But where's the Knight of the Woeful\nCountenance?\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Here soon, I hope--for a woeful Night it will be without\nhim.\n\n_Sir Geo._ Oh, fie! do you condescend to pun?\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Why not? It requires genius to make a good pun--some men of\nbright parts can't reach it. I know a Lawyer who writes them on the back\nof his briefs; and says they are of great use--in a dry cause.\n\n      _Enter_ Flutter.\n\n_Flut._ Here they come!--Here they come!----Their coach stopped, as mine\ndrove off.\n\n_Lady Fran._ Then Miss Hardy's fate is at a crisis.--She plays a\nhazardous game, and I tremble for her.\n\n_Sav._ (_without_) Come, let me guide you!--This way, my poor Friend!\nWhy are you so furious?\n\n_Doric._ (_without_) The House of Death--to the House of Death!\n\n      _Enter_ Doricourt, _and_ Saville.\n\nAh! this is the spot!\n\n_Lady Fran._ How wild and fiery he looks!\n\n_Miss Ogle._ Now, I think, he looks terrified.\n\n_Flut._ Poor creature, how his eyes work!\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ I never saw a Madman before--Let me examine him--Will he\nbite?\n\n_Sav._ Pray keep out of his reach, Ladies--You don't know your danger.\nHe's like a Wild Cat, if a sudden thought seises him.\n\n_Sir Geo._ You talk like a Keeper of Wild Cats--How much do you demand\nfor shewing the Monster?\n\n_Doric._ I don't like this--I must rouse their sensibility. There!\nthere she darts through the air in liquid flames! Down again! Now I have\nher----Oh, she burns, she scorches!--Oh! she eats into my very heart!\n\n_Omnes._ Ha! ha! ha!\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ He sees the Apparition of the wicked Italian Princess.\n\n_Flut._ Keep her Highness fast, Doricourt.\n\n_Miss Ogle._ Give her a pinch, before you let her go.\n\n_Doric._ I am laughed at!\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Laughed at--aye, to be sure; why, I could play the Madman\nbetter than you.--There! there she is! Now I have her! Ha! ha! ha!\n\n_Doric._ I knew that Devil would discover me. (_Aside_) I'll leave the\nhouse:----I'm covered with confusion. (_Going._)\n\n_Sir Geo._ Stay, Sir--You must not go. 'Twas poorly done, Mr. Doricourt,\nto affect madness, rather than fulfil your engagements.\n\n_Doric._ Affect madness!--Saville, what can I do?\n\n_Sav._ Since you are discovered, confess the whole.\n\n_Miss Ogle._ Aye, turn Evidence, and save Yourself.\n\n_Doric._ Yes; since my designs have been so unaccountably discovered, I\nwill avow the whole. I cannot love Miss Hardy--and I will never----\n\n_Sav._ Hold, my dear Doricourt! be not so rash. What will the world say\nto such----\n\n_Doric._ Damn the world! What will the world give me for the loss of\nhappiness? Must I sacrifice my peace, to please the world?\n\n_Sir Geo._ Yes, every thing, rather than be branded with dishonour.\n\n_Lady Fran._ Though _our_ arguments should fail, there _is_ a Pleader,\nwhom you surely cannot withstand--the dying Mr. Hardy supplicates you\nnot to forsake his Child.\n\n      _Enter_ Villers.\n\n_Vill._ Mr. Hardy requests you to grant him a moment's conversation,\nMr. Doricourt, though you should persist to send him miserable to the\ngrave. Let me conduct you to his chamber.\n\n_Doric._ Oh, aye, any where; to the Antipodes--to the Moon--Carry me--Do\nwith me what you will.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Mortification and disappointment, then, are specifics in\na case of stubbornness.--I'll follow, and let you know what passes.\n[_Exeunt_ Villers, Doricourt, _Mrs._ Racket, _and Miss_ Ogle.\n\n_Flut._ Ladies, Ladies, have the charity to take me with you, that I may\nmake no blunder in repeating the story. [_Exit_ Flutter.\n\n_Lady Fran._ Sir George, you don't know Mr. Saville. [_Exit Lady_\nFrances.\n\n_Sir Geo._ Ten thousand pardons--but I will not pardon myself, for not\nobserving you. I have been with the utmost impatience at your door twice\nto-day.\n\n_Sav._ I am concerned you had so much trouble, Sir George.\n\n_Sir Geo._ Trouble! what a word!--I hardly know how to address you; I am\ndistressed beyond measure; and it is the highest proof of my opinion of\nyour honour, and the delicacy of your mind, that I open my heart to you.\n\n_Sav._ What has disturbed you, Sir George?\n\n_Sir Geo._ Your having preserved Lady Frances, in so imminent a danger.\nStart not, Saville; to protect Lady Frances, was my right. You have\nwrested from me my dearest privilege.\n\n_Sav._ I hardly know how to answer such a reproach. I cannot apologize\nfor what I have done.\n\n_Sir Geo._ I do not mean to reproach you; I hardly know what I mean.\nThere is one method by which you may restore peace to me; I cannot\nendure that my Wife should be so infinitely indebted to any man who is\nless than my Brother.\n\n_Sav._ Pray explain yourself.\n\n_Sir Geo._ I have a Sister, Saville, who is amiable; and you are worthy\nof her. I shail give her a commission to steal your heart, out of\nrevenge for what you have done.\n\n_Sav._ I am infinitely honoured, Sir George; but----\n\n_Sir Geo._ I cannot listen to a sentence which begins with so\nunpromising a word. You must go with us into Hampshire; and, if you see\neach other with the eyes I do, your felicity will be complete. I know no\none, to whose heart I would so readily commit the care of my Sister's\nhappiness.\n\n_Sav._ I will attend you to Hampshire, with pleasure; but not on the\nplan of retirement. Society has claims on Lady Frances, that forbid it.\n\n_Sir Geo._ Claims, Saville!\n\n_Sav._ Yes, claims; Lady Frances was born to be the ornament of Courts.\nShe is sufficiently alarmed, not to wander beyond the reach of her\nProtector;--and, from the British Court, the most tenderly-anxious\nHusband could not wish to banish his Wife. Bid her keep in her eye the\nbright Example who presides there; the splendour of whose rank yields to\nthe superior lustre of her Virtue.\n\n_Sir Geo._ I allow the force of your argument. Now for intelligence!\n\n      _Enter Mrs._ Racket, _Lady_ Frances, _and_ Flutter.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Oh! Heav'ns! do you know----\n\n_Flut._ Let me tell the story----As soon as Doricourt--\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ I protest you sha'n't--said Mr. Hardy----\n\n_Flut._ No, 'twas Doricourt spoke first--says he--No, 'twas the\nParson--says he----\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Stop his mouth, Sir George--he'll spoil the tale.\n\n_Sir Geo._ Never heed circumstances--the result--the result.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ No, no; you shall have it in form.--Mr. Hardy performed\nthe Sick Man like an Angel--He sat up in his bed, and talked so\npathetically, that the tears stood in Doricourt's eyes.\n\n_Flut._ Aye, stood--they did not drop, but stood.--I shall, in future,\nbe very exact. The Parson seized the moment; you know, they never miss\nan opportunity.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Make haste, said Doricourt; if I have time to reflect, poor\nHardy will die unhappy.\n\n_Flut._ They were got as far as the Day of Judgement, when we slipt out\nof the room.\n\n_Sir Geo._ Then, by this time, they must have reached _Amazement_,\nwhich, every body knows, is the end of Matrimony.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Aye, the Reverend Fathers ended the service with that word,\nProphetically----to teach the Bride what a capricious Monster a Husband\nis.\n\n_Sir Geo._ I rather think it was Sarcastically--to prepare the\nBridegroom for the unreasonable humours and vagaries of his Help-mate.\n\n_Lady Fran._ Here comes the Bridegroom of to-night.\n\n      _Enter_ Doricourt _and_ Villers.--Villers _whispers_ Saville,\n      _who goes out_.\n\n_Omnes._ Joy! joy! joy!\n\n_Miss Ogle._ If _he_'s a sample of Bridegrooms, keep me single!--A\nyounger Brother, from the Funeral of his Father, could not carry a more\nfretful countenance.\n\n_Flut._ Oh!--Now, he's melancholy mad, I suppose.\n\n_Lady Fran._ You do not consider the importance of the occasion.\n\n_Vill._ No; nor how shocking a thing it is for a Man to be forced to\nmarry one Woman, whilst his heart is devoted to another.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Well, now 'tis over, I confess to you, Mr. Doricourt, I\nthink 'twas a most ridiculous piece of Quixotism, to give up the\nhappiness of a whole life to a Man who perhaps has but a few moments to\nbe sensible of the sacrifice.\n\n_Flut._ So it appeared to me.--But, thought I, Mr. Doricourt has\ntravelled--he knows best.\n\n_Doric._ Zounds! Confusion!--Did ye not all set upon me?--Didn't ye talk\nto me of Honour--Compassion--Justice?\n\n_Sir Geo._ Very true--You have acted according to their dictates, and I\nhope the utmost felicity of the Married State will reward you.\n\n_Doric._ Never, Sir George! To Felicity I bid adieu--but I will\nendeavour to be content. Where is my--I must speak it--where is my\n_Wife_?\n\n      _Enter_ Letitia, _masked, led by_ Saville.\n\n_Sav._ Mr. Doricourt, this Lady was pressing to be introduced to you.\n\n_Dor._ Oh! (_Starting_).\n\n_Let._ I told you last night, you shou'd see me at a time when you least\nexpected me--and I have kept my promise.\n\n_Vill._ Whoever you are, Madam, you could not have arrived at a happier\nmoment.--Mr. Doricourt is just married.\n\n_Let._ Married! Impossible! 'Tis but a few hours since he swore to me\neternal Love: I believ'd him, gave him up my Virgin heart--and\nnow!--Ungrateful Sex!\n\n_Dor._ Your Virgin heart! No, Lady----my fate, thank Heaven! yet wants\nthat torture. Nothing but the conviction that you was another's, could\nhave made me think one moment of Marriage, to have saved the lives of\nhalf Mankind. But this visit, Madam, is as barbarous as unexpected. It\nis now my duty to forget you, which, spite of your situation, I found\ndifficult enough.\n\n_Let._ My situation!--What situation?\n\n_Dor._ I must apologise for explaining it in this company--but, Madam, I\nam not ignorant, that you are the companion of Lord George Jennet--and\nthis is the only circumstance that can give me peace.\n\n_Let._ I--a Companion! Ridiculous pretence! No, Sir, know, to your\nconfusion, that my heart, my honour, my name is unspotted as her's you\nhave married; my birth equal to your own, my fortune large--That, and my\nperson, might have been your's.--But, Sir, farewell! (_Going._)\n\n_Dor._ Oh, stay a moment----Rascal! is she not----\n\n_Flut._ Who, she? O Lard! no--'Twas quite a different person that I\nmeant.--I never saw that Lady before.\n\n_Dor._ Then, never shalt thou see her more. [_Shakes_ Flutter.]\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ Have mercy upon the poor Man!--Heavens! He'll murder him.\n\n_Dor._ Murder him! Yes, you, myself, and all Mankind. Sir\nGeorge--Saville--Villers--'twas you who push'd me on this\nprecipice;--'tis you who have snatch'd from me joy, felicity, and life.\n\n_Mrs. Rack._ There! Now, how well he acts the Madman!--This is something\nlike! I knew he would do it well enough, when the time came.\n\n_Dor._ Hard-hearted Woman! enjoy my ruin--riot in my wretchedness.\n[Hardy _bursts in_.]\n\n_Har._ This is too much. You are now the Husband of my Daughter; and how\ndare you shew all this passion about another Woman?\n\n_Dor._ Alive again!\n\n_Har._ Alive! aye, and merry. Here, wipe off the flour from my face. I\nwas never in better health and spirits in my life.--I foresaw t'would\ndo--. Why, my illness was only a fetch, Man! to make you marry Letty.\n\n_Dor._ It was! Base and ungenerous! Well, Sir, you shall be gratified.\nThe possession of my heart was no object either with You, or your\nDaughter. My fortune and name was all you desired, and these--I leave\nye. My native England I shall quit, nor ever behold you more. But, Lady,\nthat in my exile I may have one consolation, grant me the favour you\ndenied last night;--let me behold all that mask conceals, that your\nwhole image may be impress'd on my heart, and chear my distant solitary\nhours.\n\n_Let._ This is the most awful moment of my life. Oh, Doricourt, the\nslight action of taking off my Mask, stamps me the most blest or\nmiserable of Women!\n\n_Dor._ What can this mean? Reveal your face, I conjure you.\n\n_Let._ Behold it.\n\n_Dor._ Rapture! Transport! Heaven!\n\n_Flut._ Now for a touch of the happy Madman.\n\n_Vill._ This scheme was mine.\n\n_Let._ I will not allow that. This little stratagem arose from my\ndisappointment, in not having made the impression on you I wish'd. The\ntimidity of the English character threw a veil over me, you could not\npenetrate. You have forced me to emerge in some measure from my natural\nreserve, and to throw off the veil that hid me.\n\n_Dor._ I am yet in a state of intoxication--I cannot answer you.--Speak\non, sweet Angel!\n\n_Let._ You see I _can_ be any thing; chuse then my character--your Taste\nshall fix it. Shall I be an _English_ Wife?--or, breaking from the bonds\nof Nature and Education, step forth to the world in all the captivating\nglare of Foreign Manners?\n\n_Dor._ You shall be nothing but yourself--nothing can be captivating\nthat you are not. I will not wrong your penetration, by pretending that\nyou won my heart at the first interview; but you have now my whole\nsoul--your person, your face, your mind, I would not exchange for those\nof any other Woman breathing.\n\n_Har._ A Dog! how well he makes up for past slights! Cousin Racket, I\nwish you a good Husband with all my heart. Mr. Flutter, I'll believe\nevery word you say this fortnight. Mr. Villers, you and I have manag'd\nthis to a T. I never was so merry in my life--'Gad, I believe I can\ndance. (_Footing._)\n\n_Doric._ Charming, charming creature!\n\n_Let._ Congratulate me, my dear friends! Can you conceive my happiness?\n\n_Har._ No, congratulate me; for mine is the greatest.\n\n_Flut._ No, congratulate me, that I have escaped with life, and give me\nsome sticking plaster--this wild cat has torn the skin from my throat.\n\n_Sir Geo._ I expect to be among the first who are congratulated--for I\nhave recovered one Angel, while Doricourt has gained another.\n\n_Har._ Pho! pho! Don't talk of Angels, we shall be happier by half as\nMortals. Come into the next room; I have order'd out every drop of my\nForty-eight, and I'll invite the whole parish of St. George's, but what\nwe'll drink it out--except one dozen, which I shall keep under three\ndouble locks, for a certain Christening, that I foresee will happen\nwithin this twelvemonth.\n\n_Dor._ My charming Bride! It was a strange perversion of Taste, that led\nme to consider the delicate timidity of your deportment, as the mark of\nan uninform'd mind, or inelegant manners. I feel now it is to that\ninnate modesty, _English_ Husbands owe a felicity the Married Men of\nother nations are strangers to: it is a sacred veil to your own charms;\nit is the surest bulwark to your Husband's honour; and cursed be the\nhour--should it ever arrive--in which _British_ Ladies shall sacrifice\nto _foreign Graces_ the Grace of Modesty!\n\n_FINIS._\n\n\n\n\nEPILOGUE.\n\n\n  _Nay, cease, and hear me--I am come to scold--_\n  _Whence this night's plaudits, to a thought so old?_\n  _To gain a Lover, hid behind a Mask!_\n  _What's new in that? or where's the mighty task?_\n  _For instance, now--What Lady Bab, or Grace,_\n  _E'er won a Lover--in her_ natural _Face_?\n  _Mistake me not--French red, or blanching creams,_\n  _I stoop not to--for those are hackney'd themes;_\n  _The arts I mean, are harder to detect,_\n  _Easier put on, and worn to more effect;--_\n  _As thus----_\n  _Do Pride and Envy, with their horrid lines,_\n  _Destroy th' effect of Nature's sweet designs?_\n  _The Mask of Softness is at once applied,_\n  _And gentlest manners ornament the Bride._\n    _Do thoughts too free inform the Vestal's eye,_\n  _Or point the glance, or warm the struggling sigh?_\n  _Not Dian's brows more rigid looks disclose;_\n  _And Virtue's blush appears, where Passion glows._\n\n    _And you, my gentle Sirs, wear Vizors too;_      }\n  _But here I'll strip you, and expose to view_      }\n  _Your hidden features----First I point at you._    }\n  _That well-stuff'd waistcoat, and that ruddy cheek;_\n  _That ample forehead, and that skin so sleek,_\n  _Point out good-nature, and a gen'rous heart----_\n  _Tyrant! stand forth, and, conscious, own thy part:_\n  _Thy Wife, thy Children, tremble in thy eye;_\n  _And Peace is banish'd--when the_ Father's _nigh_.\n\n    _Sure 'tis enchantment!

The errata have been\nincorporated. The spelling of character names has been harmonised.\nOverall, contemporary spellings have been retained; however, a small\nnumber of words have been modernised to prevent misunderstanding. One\ninstance of \"genus\" was left unchanged, since it may well serve a\npurpose in furthering the characterisation. A section of publisher's\nadvertising at the end was illegible and has been omitted. One instance\nof double typesetting (same word at end of one line and the beginning\nof the next) was corrected.\n\nAlthough there is occasional reference in the stage directions to \"(the)\nMiss Ogles\" it is clear from the context that the name is \"Ogle\" and\nonly one character of that name is present, so the name was changed\naccordingly.\n\nAt the end of the scene at Sir George's in Act 2, Mrs Racket exits twice\nin short order; this reflects the original. Three substantive changes\nwere made:\n\nIn Act 2, \"your\" was changed to \"you\" in Harcourt's speech:\n\n      _Har._ I foresee this won't do!--Mr. Doricourt, may be you\n      take my Daughter for a Fool; but *you* are mistaken: she's a\n      sensible Girl, as any in England.\n\nIn Act 4, \"On\" was replaced by \"Oh\" at the beginning of Flutter's\nspeech:\n\n      _Flut._ Oh, every creature.--A Mask is nothing at all to\n      me.--I can give you the history of half the people here.\n\nIn Act 5, scene 3, Is is was changed to Is it in Lady Frances\nTouchwood's question:\n\n      Is it true that Doricourt is mad?\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE BELLE'S STRATAGEM***\n\n\n******* This file should be named 47604-0.txt or 47604-0.zip *******\n\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/dirs\/4\/7\/6\/0\/47604\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\nbe renamed.\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\nroyalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of\ncomputers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It\nexists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations\nfrom people in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future\ngenerations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see\nSections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at\nwww.gutenberg.org \n\nSection 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary \nArchive Foundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by\nU.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the\nmailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its\nvolunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous\nlocations.

Newby\n    Chief Executive and Director\n    gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\nSection 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular\nstate visit www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To\ndonate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org\/donate\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project\nGutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be\nfreely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and\ndistributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of\nvolunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\nedition.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n","id":20,"split":"train"}
