{"ori_id":"2453d062843edc379bdae3be69859e18bf1abd9d","title":"The Fault in Our Stars (film)","context":"The Fault in Our Stars (film)\n Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) is an intelligent and witty teenager living in Indianapolis, who has terminal thyroid cancer that has since spread to her lungs. Believing she is depressed, Hazel's mother Frannie (Laura Dern) urges her to attend a weekly cancer patient support group to help her make friends who are going through the same thing.\nOne week, Hazel meets Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), a charming teenager who lost a leg from bone cancer years earlier but has since been cancer-free. He invites Hazel to his house and she accepts, where they bond over their hobbies and agree to read each other's favorite book. Hazel recommends An Imperial Affliction, a novel about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels Hazel's experience, and Augustus gives Hazel Counter Insurgence. They keep in touch via text over the weeks that follow and grow closer. After Augustus finishes the book, he expresses frustration with its abrupt ending (it ends in the middle of a sentence). Hazel explains that the novel's mysterious author, Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe), retreated to Amsterdam following the novel's publication and has not been heard from since.\nWeeks later, Augustus tells Hazel that he has traced Van Houten's assistant, Lidewij (Lotte Verbeek), and has corresponded with Van Houten by email. Hazel then writes to him to find out more about the novel's ambiguous ending and Van Houten replies that he is only willing to answer her questions in person. Overwhelmed and excited, Hazel asks her mother if she can travel to Amsterdam to visit him, but Frannie rejects it because of financial and medical constraints. Augustus suggests that she use her \"cancer wish\" since children and young adults with life-threatening illnesses receive one arranged experience of their choice, but Hazel explains that she already used hers to visit Disney World when she was younger. Augustus and Hazel go on a picnic date and soon begin to fall in love. Augustus also surprises Hazel with tickets to Amsterdam after using his wish on her. However, days before the trip, Hazel suffers from pleural effusion and is sent to an intensive care unit (ICU). Although initially concerned, her doctors eventually agree to allow the trip, since they expect that she will soon become incapable of doing anything at all.\nHazel and Augustus arrive in Amsterdam and are presented with reservations at an expensive restaurant, pre-paid for by Van Houten. During the meal, Augustus confesses his love for Hazel. The following afternoon, they get the bus into the city and head to Van Houten's house, but are soon shocked to find he is a mean-spirited alcoholic; Lidewij arranged the meeting and their dinner on his behalf without him knowing anything about it. Angered by his assistant's actions, he taunts Hazel for seeking serious answers to a piece of fiction and belittles her medical condition. She leaves, utterly distraught. On their way back to the hotel, Lidewij invites them to go sightseeing to make up for their ruined experience. The three visit the Anne Frank House, where Hazel struggles to climb the house's many stairs. At the end of the tour, Augustus and Hazel kiss to the applause of many fellow tourists. They spend that night together in their hotel and have sex for the first time. The next day while out in the city, Augustus tells Hazel that his cancer has relapsed, has spread throughout his body and is terminal. Hazel is heartbroken, expressing how unfair life can be.\nAfter their return to Indianapolis, Augustus' health worsens each week. Hazel receives a desperate call from him late at night after he tries to get a new pack of cigarettes at the gas station. He is taken to the ICU for a few days and realizes he is close to death. Augustus invites his blind best friend Isaac (Nat Wolff) and Hazel to his pre-funeral, where they deliver eulogies that they have both prepared. Hazel tells him she would not trade their short time together for anything, since he \"gave me a forever within the numbered days.\"\nAugustus dies eight days later. At his funeral, Hazel is astonished to find Van Houten in attendance. He tells her he maintained correspondence with Augustus after Amsterdam and that Augustus had demanded he attend his funeral to make up for the spoiled trip. He then tells Hazel that his novel is based on the experiences of his daughter Anna, who died from leukemia at a young age. Van Houten tries to tell Hazel about the fate of Anna's mother; he gives Hazel a piece of paper. Hazel, still upset with his behavior in Amsterdam, crumples up the paper and asks him to leave. Later, talking with Isaac, Hazel learns that Augustus had asked Van Houten to help him write a eulogy for her. She retrieves the crumpled paper and reads Augustus' words, which state his acceptance of death and his love for Hazel. Hazel lies on her back on her lawn looking up at the stars, smiling as she remembers Augustus and says \"Okay.\"\n<html>\n<head><title>Fault in Our Stars, The Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Fault in Our Stars, The script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Fault in Our Stars, The script, Fault in Our Stars, The movie script, Fault in Our Stars, The film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

It's the deep thump of a BASS BEAT. Loud.\n          Like, obnoxiously loud.\n          Hazel grabs the brass ornament and knocks. They wait.

All he says is:\n\n<b>           MAN IN PAJAMAS\n<\/b>           What?!\n          Gus and Hazel look to one another.

She virtually shoves\n          Van Houten towards a stunned Gus and Hazel.\n          And they are again face-to-face with Van Houten. One beat,\n          two beats. No one knows what to say.

You're a\n           shitty person but a good writer.\n           We'd make a good team. I don't want\n           to ask you any favors but if you\n           have the time, and from what I saw\n           you have plenty, please fix this\n           for me. It's a eulogy for Hazel.\n          Hazel is overcome with emotion.\n\n<b>                          GUS'S VOICE\n<\/b>           She asked me to write one and I'm\n           trying, I just, I could use a\n           little flair. See the thing is...\n           we all want to be remembered.\n          She smiles to herself, remembering:\n          - That first time Gus and Hazel ran into each other.\n          - The staring contest in Support Group.\n\n<b>                          GUS'S VOICE\n<\/b>           We all want to leave a mark.\n          - Driving (badly) in Gus's car.\n          - Their first kiss at the picnic by \"Funky Bones.\"\n\n<b>                          GUS'S VOICE\n<\/b>           But not Hazel. Hazel is different.\n           Hazel knows the truth. She didn't\n           want a million admirers, she just\n           wanted one. And she got it. Maybe\n           she wasn't loved widely but she was\n           loved deeply. And isn't that more\n           than most of us get?\n          - And BACK TO HAZEL reading the letter, tears in her eyes.\n\n<b>                          GUS'S VOICE\n<\/b>           When Hazel was sick, I knew I was\n           dying. But I didn't want to say so.\n\n<b>           113.\n<\/b>\n                         \n\n<b>          INT ICU - FLASHBACK\n<\/b>          Gus stealthily sneaks into Hazel's single room in the ICU.\n          She sleeps.

Her eyes were closed,\n           her lungs were intubated...\n\n          Gus takes her hand and holds it.\n\n<b>                          GUS'S VOICE\n<\/b>           ... but her hands were still her\n           hands, still warm, and the nails\n           painted this dark blue back color\n           and I just held her hands and I\n           willed myself to imagine a world\n           without us and what a worthless\n           world that would be.\n          - AND BACK TO HAZEL reading the letter. She never knew that\n          story, never knew he was there.

She lays down on the grass and\n          looks up at the stars - the same IMAGE that opened the movie.\n\n<b>                          GUS'S VOICE\n<\/b>           She's so beautiful.

She's funny\n           without ever being mean.\n\n<b>                         SHE REMEMBERS:\n<\/b>          - The magical dinner at Oranjee.\n          - The bench in which they sat overlooking the water.\n          - The passionate kiss in Anne Frank's house.\n          - Falling onto the bed together.\n\n          [All of these are images we saw at the beginning of the\n          movie, only now, we SEE the oxygen tank, we SEE Gus's leg, we\n          SEE the fumbling and the difficulties etc. They don't make\n          these images less beautiful.

She holds the letter to her\n          chest. A single tear falls onto her cheeks.\n\n<b>                          GUS'S VOICE\n<\/b>           I like my choices.
